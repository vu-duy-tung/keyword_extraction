And then it took 15 minutes for the guy to hand me a check. Instead he was cleaning glasses, which is great and all, except when you have a customer who needs service. I was going to eat but decided against it from talking to the people on either side of me who said their food was somewhere between mediocre and terrible. Besides, no one tried to take my order even though I had a good menu in front of me. Robert Irvine probably needs to come do a Restaurant Impossible on his own place.",

No problem since the bar usually has great service and alot of ambience. Neither was the case here. We gad to flag down the bartender to get a drink and menus. The food was very good, therefore rated it a 3 vs a 1. We had to ask for the bill 2 times. It had someone elses beer and salad on our bill. Took longer to get the corrected bill! They boast 100 beers on tap, but every one I saw poured had a 3 to 4 inch head. They kept pouring off the foam to get a glass of beer. This wasn't just one tap, but was on at least 6. Thwn the bartenders couldn't pour a bortle eitger without a huge head of foam.",

At my table were myself and my four children.  The man who waited on us, whose name I do not know because he did not introduce himself to us, was about 35-45 with a reddish blond beard.  This week is restaurant week in Las Vegas, and as such there is a special 3 course meal offering.  He did not tell us about this, however the two tables to either side of us were given this information.  When our food came out 3 of the meals arrived and we had to wait 10 more minutes for the other two.  When I eat at a restaurant, I expect all of our food to come out together.  The icing on the cake for the evening was waiting 20+minutes to receive our check.  The table next to us, that sat down after us, got their food after us, and finished eating after us, received their check before we were given ours.  The only difference between us and everyone else was the presence of the children.  If you have children do not go here as you will likely be discriminated against.  I used to wait tables and as such I know the expectations restaurants have for their staff.  I think Robert needs to come back and fix his restaurant.",

The food and drinks were superb. The service and atmosphere were also top notch. George Lessary made our evening even more pleasant. He was very attentive, helpful, and entertaining considering my girlfriend and I had a couple drinks under our belt and felt a little rambunctious lol. I could go on and on about our experience; however, I'll simply  recommend visiting if and when in Vegas. Being locals ourselves we'll definitely be coming back!!!

The \"handheld\" burger was cover in said cheese sauce so you couldn't pick it up and eat it.  Now, when I say covered, I mean covered.  The bun and everything was drowned in this terrible cheese sauce. It looked disgusting, like a baby threw up on top of the bun.  I'm pretty sure the first rule of fine food is to make sure everything LOOKS appetizing, the second is to make sure it tastes good. This failed both. The \"crispy bacon\" was actually deep fried pork belly that was neither crispy or technically bacon. The ph sauce was non-existent. The burger wasn't cooked to my preference, and by the time I finally took a bite my hands were covered in crappy cheese sauce.  The burger was super thin and not even a 1/4 lb.  When the waitress tried to help she brought some ranch for our group, and again didn't taste like anything. It definitely didn't taste like ranch.  For a $22 burger in Vegas that was absolute shit. I'm not a picky eater, and always eat fine food how the chef prepares it, but this was not fine food.  Robert Irving may want to consider removing his name from this horrible restaurant so it can be properly labeled as a McDonalds. This restaurant used to be really good, but everything changed and not for the best.  Bring back the French onion fondue and I may consider giving The Public House another chance.",

    "text": "I have to tell you that we came here on Father's Day and this place quickly earned itself three strikes.   However, I must confess they righted each one of them.  But before they did we were stunned and thought: \"How could Robert Irvine's own restaurant suffer from the same failures as the very restaurants he rescues.\" It was almost on oxymoron.   Strike one:   The hostess let's us know the father gets one free pint.  Then the waitress says the same and lists them: \"Bud Light, Coors Light, Michalob Ultra and Corona only\" so I joke with here and say \"What do all those beers and making love in a canoe have in common\" My wife chimes in before the punch line: \"Some thing are worth paying for.\" We joke: \"Robert sure is a cheap skate.\" So we order our drinks a prosecco and a La Chouf on draft.  The punch line: \"They are all fucking close to Water.\" Strike two: Waitress comes back with prosecco but no draft.  WTF.  \"I am so sorry but today is our last day of this food menu and draft list. We are out of the La Chouf.\"  Just exactly how is your last day of your menu any excuse and now my problem???  Anyhow I ordered another, Delirium, which was great and the waitress apologized and the manager comped the draft. So we think strike one and two erased right??? Nope Strike Two continue like a Star Wars saga or a runaway train.  We order all appetizers including the croquettes.  Waitress states: \"I am so sorry but we might not have the croquettes as it is the last day of our menu and we make them here from scratch yada, yada, yada\" Who gives a flying f@ck right???  Waitress will check.  Not 30 seconds later I see another waitress bringing out two orders of croquettes.  The wait staff is suffering from fake news, and bad management.   Strike Three: One of our appetizers was the French fries with bacon and chevre.  They would have been great if brought out HOT as opposed to room temperature.  Of course we complained and about 5 mins later a new order came out hot and it was comped also.   All in all the place was good.  We will probably be back on another Vegas trip.  But man, when you have a prominent successful TV show about rescuing restaurants you can't afford a hitch in your own ride.  Time to look in the mirror first before you flunk out of Vegas.  Good luck.",

The wagyu sliders were ridiculous.  Hands down the best burger I've ever had. The girls loved them too. we had the poutine ( a meal in itself with pulled pork, shiitake mushrooms and goat cheese), the baked ricotta, PH rolls, the carbonara mac n cheese, and the wedge salad. EVERYTHING was delicious.  the service is impeccable. Fred was our server but all of the staff we encountered were just as friendly, helpful and amazing. it was so refreshing. we will be back soon!",

    "text": "You are what you eat. Chefs cook what they love to eat. Therefore, if I want a solid body like chef Irvine, I should eat what he cooks.    WIN!  Cheese curds, deep-fried this and that, butter milk, butter sauces, oh yeah, let the body sculpting begin!  Straight up, take pub classics from around the world, enhance them by boosting up their flavor with American excess and you have Robert Irvine's Public House.  Just keep in mind, sometimes messing with the classics doesn't always mean better.  Starters are meant to be shared. Top props to the steak tartare.  Tender, hand cut beef, traditional prepared with onions egg and capers, but improved with the addition of lemon zest which serves to bring out the metallic flavor of the beef.   The crab, pancetta and mozzarella arancini, also very good. Creamy rice on the inside with the crispy breading on the outside. Creme fraiche and tarragon blend the flavors while a siracha and balsamic glaze adds an unexpected earthiness.  Finally the Public House poutine. This is an example of why you should not mess with the classic. Crisp tater tots smothered in pulled pork and shiitake onion gravy, goat cheese, and sorrel.  Heavy, the sweetness of the onions evident, goat cheese adding creaminess.  Flabby.  Greens do nothing for the flavor or health factor of the dish.  For mains, great braised lamb shank.  Not overcooked and stringy, this one tender and deeply flavored. Solid mussels and frites.  Relatively pump mussels steamed in a creamy beer and butter sauce.  Dipping the crisp fries into the cooking liquid after swallowing down a mussel, ahhh.  Agreeable fish and chips, a heavily battered properly cooked piece of cod on a pile of thin cut fries is tasty enough.  The curry aioli atop the fries makes the dish. The addition of coleslaw bacon and feta is puzzling. Lastly, the shepherd's pie, no complaints.  Not excessively oily, the cook ground lamb imparts just the right amount of gaminess to the rustic dish.  Service is a work in progress. Still clumsy. It should improve with time  Well-chosen list of beer and gastropub staples.  Typical resort markup.  Oh hey, I feel my belly is firmer.  Maybe the start of my six pack abs?  I better go back and try more.  Unexpectedly solid coming from a celebrity chef.",

I had the special bacon burger - my advice YES get the burger - NO don't pour the fondue cheese over the burger. I cut my burger up and dipped bites into the sauce. The sauce is heavy, but ooohh so good.  Good choice of beers on tap.  Making plays to return in the evening   2nd here. This time after SEMA show for dinner. We had the porkchop and the skirt streak. My I my this was an excellent meal. The skirt steak was served with a delicious and slightly spiced sauce, asparagus and fries.  The pork chop was huge, had great flavor and served with mashed potatoes. The sauce was excellent.  Next time I am going to sub for the mashed potatoes.   They now have Guinness on tap!   Our server was excellent and attentive.  We were cracked up when we heard the sound of what thought were flip flops dragging on the floor  only to see the manager wearing some fancy like slippers. Really slippers?!?  Shoes may slip on but these were slippers - no backs on the heels.  Kinda weird we notice stuff like this!!!!",

The manager was lending a hand to his staff running food and stopped to chat with my 3 year old nephew who charmed his way into a free dessert. We chose a chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with ice cream and it was warm and gooey and a perfect mess for the kid.

My husband ordered the schnitzel and I ordered the steak and Guiness pie.  We sent both dishes back.  The schnitzel was dry and tough.  It came with a roumalad that was more like tartar sauce.  They forgot to bring the sauce and I had to remind the server it was forgotten.  Perhaps it was omitted because it wasn't worth eating. The pastry dough on the steak pie was not nice and flaky.  Too much flour and not enough love.  The filling did not have a good flavor.  The server was nice and allowed us to change for burgers.  The burgers and fries were good but not fantastic.

I came there with my family tonight and we had the salmon (which was good), the 3 cheese pizza (very oily), the liver and onions (tasty but very heavy, served with fries?) the fish and chips (one huge piece of cod- not a great way to serve fried fish, not crispy enough) and the Kale salad (decently flavored but huge chunks of cheese  in a kale salad was out of place). The worst dish was the shepherds pie though. SUPER oily ground lamb (meat needed to be drained before baking it) under seasoned, kinda gross. We had to take antacid pills after eating here. I wanted to love it bc I'm a fan of Irvine, but he needs to get in the kitchen and make the food up to the standards we expect.",

This was an awesome experience they were very cordial and seated us where we wanted to be seated. They were extremely attentive and very detailed in explaining the favorites so far in their young life as a restaurant. We will definitely be back. The fish and chips was amazing. I was worried for a second because it looked like it would be all batter but I cracked it open and it was all delicious flaky fish that wasn't on the fishy side...very tender and moist. The fries were awesome as well shoestring fries with goat cheese and this awesome kind of sweet mustard sauce along with fresh chopped bacon. Looking forward to our next date night here!",

The menu wasn't what I was hoping for in terms of variety but the food was delicious and our waitress was nice but definitely could've visited our table more so we could ask for ketchup and curry sauce for the fries while they were hot.

We came back for dinner and I just had the chicken wings appetizer which was really good, actually. Our service for dinner was a little spotty, which was surprising because Robert Irvine himself was in the restaurant.

Yes, it was Robert Irvine's name and picture that really brought us in. We hemmed and hawed about where to eat lunch. Robert... you beat out Giada.  :)  We were eating at an off-time - 2:30 or 3. There really weren't too many people eating at that time but that did not discourage the staff from taking good care of us. A coupe of very tasty cocktails, followed by roasted veg, salmon, fish and chips, and a bowl of ramen.  All were yummy.",

I just think they still have some kinks to work out though which is why for now I'd give it 3 stars instead of 4.  With Yelp check in, they offered a free appetizer when you order an entree, score!  We opted to try the Public House Poutine which we both thought was pretty good.  It's some crispy tots topped with pulled pork, shiitake gravy and goat cheese.  The entrees ordered were the Steak & Frites, and the Kurobuta Pork Chop.  I'd say the pork chop was the better of the two, mainly because the overall execution of the steak dish fell short.  The temp of the skirt steak was done nicely (mid-rare) but it was just under seasoned and generally bland. While the asparagus was hot and al dente, the fries on the other hand were painfully stale and cold.  The pork chop on the other hand had more flavor and the other components on the dish hot.  The other thing was the restaurant seemed under staffed and the staff looked kind of out of sorts.  It was about 1/2 full but was still hard to find a server or busser when we wanted to get some steak knives that wasn't brought with our entrees.  The menu looks good and I'd love to try some of the other dishes so it's worth going back for another try.  Hopefully some of the kinks are worked out by then.",

    "text": "My experience here was overall very pleasant. First, this restaurant is inside our hotel so it was definitely convenient and seemed like the best option after searching around a little as well.   We arrived at 4:40 and were told that they didn't serve anything but \"bar food\" until 5:00pm so we decided we'd just come back in 20. I asked the hostess if we should make a reservation while we were there and she said \"no, you should be fine!\"   We came back at 4:59pm and there was already a 15 minutes wait, which wasn't bad. We were sat at a nice table away from the casino and were immediately brought waters. It took a few more minutes for our server to arrive but as soon as he came to the table he greeted us with an extremely genuine excitement and took our orders right away.   We got an appetizer-- the onion fondue (DELICIOUS) and two entrees-- a burger and a pizza. My pizza was soooo yummy, the toppings were well balanced, and the crust was perfection! My friend's burger was HUGE and she said it was delicious. We had a bunch of fondue leftover after we had finished all the bread that came with it and the waiter even brought us more.   GREAT service, delicious food, and yummy drinks as well! The price seemed reasonable considering the amount and quality of food, as well as being inside a casino/hotel. I would definitely come back here and/or recommend it to a friend.",

    "text": "My friend and I were checking out the Laugh Factory last night and decided to eat at Robert  Irvine's before the show.  Bad Choice!  We both decided to try the burgers. You can't go wrong with burgers right??? Wrong!   I ordered the Public House Burger which came with ham, fried egg, lettuce, tomato and the Parker House Roll. First off, I think the waitress forgot to pick up our orders on time.  My burger was almost cold! But I didn't complain because we waited a half hour to get our food. The Parker House Roll looked like Hawaiian bread but it was so hard and lacked flavor! I didn't even eat 95% of the bun. I substituted the fries for tator tots. The tots were the only things I enjoyed.  My friend got the F and K Fondue burger which came with bacon, mushroom, lettuce and a cheese fondue which I guess you're  to pour over the burger which where the \"Fork and Knife\" comes into play. He hated his bun too and it was a brioche bun. So hard! The cheese fondue was actually really good. We dipped out tator tots in the cheese!  Our waitress sucked! We barely saw her and they weren't that busy. The male runner did a way better than she did. He got our drinks and salt and pepper (btw which isn't on the tables because Robert Irvine doesn't want it on the tables).  The decor and bar area looked very nice but I won't return due to the poor service and horrible overpriced food! Burgers were $23 a piece. Would have been happier with a Quarter Pounder from McDonald's. Yes, you heard me.... McDonald's!  Do NOT recommend!",

I probably would not go back here unless it was to just grab a drink.",

If prices were reduced some 10 to 15% it would be a great value place. Otherwise they might not get enough Patrons  to keep the place. Or mix up they a bit for more choices.  I must say my pizza tasted excellent and the service I got was superb. Also a very convenient thing to have it inside the hotel. But there are other options nearby too. I liked it almost can pass as a high end sports bar.",

The 3 bartenders not only serve the large bar but also the lounge/game area, so are SO busy. But they do it flawlessly. If I was in charge, I would put a few more servers in that area. We ordered beef sliders and a baked honey ricotta appetizer- they were not mind-blowing, but were good. I burned my hand on the cast-iron serving dish that the cheese was in-ouch! For the portion size and the quality/taste, the food is overpriced. $12 for 2 small sliders, and the same price for the ricotta, which only came with 4 slices of toast, 1 of which was burned. The service is good, the atmosphere is trendy, and the drink menu is large. If the food was better or cheaper, I would return.",

Often at places like this, if you want to do a take out order you ask the hostess. I did, and she directed me to the bar. The first bartender I talked to had me go sit on the other side of the bar to talk to the other bartender. While all the individuals in this scenario were polite, it just seemed like overkill shuffling to me, and then unfortunately there was an order mixup and they gave mine away, so I spent 20 of my 30 minutes of lunch waiting for a salad. I understand that happens, not upset, but it didn't make my shuffling experience any better.   All that's to say...if needed I would be fine giving it another shot, though options for non-meat eaters are really limited.",

    "text": "Very large and modern looking place inside Tropicana. Service was ok, nothing special for lunch. I think we were expecting much better food considering Irvine's pedigree. Lunch menu is a little limited, and we were fairly disappointed they had ran out of the lobster roll... not a great start. Beer list is extensive, they also have concoctions that their own line of spirits in them. Had the croque madame, sandwich was good not great. The side salad that it came with was sad, no real dressing and just a couple tomatoes and cucumbers with greens. Chicken avocado bowl nothing to write home about. Overall food was just sub par, definitely not a repeat destination. 3/5",

Shoestring fries and scampi toast to start were yummy. I had the salmon nicoise which was perfect, others had the Guinness pie and steak. A nice bottle of Rose rounded out the meal. The cookie dessert was also worth the 20 minute wait required. Now the reason for the four star review instead of five is that they were out of mashed potatoes so certain items on the menu were unavailable. Having made mashed potatoes many times in my life I was perplexed. Are they out of potatoes? Maybe they were. Are there other restaurants in the hotel/casino to get them from? Yes, of course. In the time frame we were there I could have made my own.",

The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere is laid-back so I felt pretty relaxed as a single woman out to grab food.  The wild mushroom pizza was rather limp and I couldn't taste the truffle oil that is part of the description on the menu. There are more goat cheese than mushroom and I felt that really overshadowed the \"mushroom\" part of the pizza. A more apt name for the pizza would be \"Goat Cheese Pizza with Mushroom Accent.\"  Alright, I have high standards and am from the bay area and have exceedingly high standards. I am hard to please and Robert Irvine's Public House did well enough to merit a second visit if there aren't more exciting options. :)",

    "text": "Vegas has quickly become the Mecca of celebrity chef eateries. You'd expect Wolfgang Puck and Jose Andres to be here, of course, but Chefs Gordon Ramsey, Scott Conant, Christina Tosi and Chris Santos all have eateries here, with rumors of more to come from leading lights like Alex Guarnaschelli.  So when I heard that the \"Muscle Chef,\" Robert Irvine was coming here, it wasn't exactly a shock.  But experienced fans and foodies alike know that you NEVER go to a restaurant on Opening Week.  You give them a chance to work out all the bugs and the kinks FIRST, and then try it, so that if stuff still goes wrong, at least you know it's not because of 'premiere jitters.'  So we finally found our way to the Public House, and WOW.  It was everything I expected and more.  Besides the fantastic view of the Strip, with the MGM Grand directly across the street, the food was definitely all that and a bag of hickory chips.  Those who follow Chef Robert know that his particular M.O. is taking comfort food classics and putting a healthier spin on them. (To look at the man, you'd think he only survives on huge haunches of mutton or beef.) So the grub was everything associated with the Irvine brand and then some.  Take the poutine, for example. When you hear the word, if you've had it before, you know what to expect: hot, cripsy fries smothered in rich gravy and ooey-gooey cheese curds.  Chef Irvine's version still has the ooey-gooeyness thing going, but he dials it back with marinated and grilled sliced Shiitake mushrooms and onions and fresh greens, with tender, shredded pork subbing for the usual crispy bacon bits. With just a taste of the curds still asserting themselves, the meaty goodness of the pork and 'shrooms informs the app in a way that finds you not missing all the extra calories!  And can I get a witness on the French Onion Fondue? They just need to bring a LOAF of Ciabatta bread to the table to go with, because the fondue itself is so damn good, you WILL finish it off with a spoon once the bread slices are gone...trust and believe!  Where Bear had the fish and chips for his main course, (and one taste told me to order THAT on our next visit), I stuck with the Shepherd's Pie.  It was lovely enough, but a little on the dry side, because I was missing the gravy that comes from mixing a roux in with the natural juices of the meat - in this case, ground lamb.  I mean the mashed potato crust does provide texture and moisture, and I know it skirts the extra calories.  But not having the gravy was my only...'BEEF' with this dish. (Sorry...)  The 'Banoffee Pie' was something I'd never heard of before, so that was my go-to for dessert. Light, fruity, with just a hint of the toffee within, it's the espresso ice cream that finally sends you into Sugar Nirvana, instead of Sugar Overload.   Our wait person, Raimonda (sp?) was funny, knowledgeable and kept the drinks and recommendations coming...not to mention that she walked us out and made sure we had her card before we left.  Now THAT is customer service!    We don't frequent the Strip THAT much, but we'll definitely be requesting seating in her section, the next time we're back down there.  Overall, Chef Irvine shoots and SCORES with his new digs! You should go...like yesterday.",

Pounded thin, lightly breaded and not greasy. Served with fingerling potatoes.   Nice decor, friendly waitstaff. Next time I am in Vegas I am definitely coming back for a more casual lunch/dinner.

But that being said there are very good things on the menu. They have a poutine that is delicious. They have a shoestring fry with feta and some yellow sauce on them that is to die! So good The Chinese chicken salad is great! And my new favorite is the chicken Milanese sandwich. Every bite is orgasmic haha",

Let me preface this by stating I have been in the food business for 28 years and must say this was disappointing.   Tonight was our first time trying the restaurant and from the beginning our server, the only female waitress, was not friendly, rude and basically didn't care. If I'm going to pay $28 a dish I expect good service. Lazy at best.   The food was just OK.  Pricey to say the least. Skirt Steak $28 seemed high, fish and chips 1 piece $23 seemed very high.  Food was ready but sitting under the warmer for 10 minutes. Just bring it out nice and hot-don't wait!This restaurant should not command those type of prices.   One pice of fish and chip should be no more than $12.   I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. Not sure if this place will survive.  If management want to talk to me let me know.",

    "text": "My Wife and I have always tried to venture out and try top named chef's places. We had just been to Giada's at the Cromwell and were excited to try Robert Irvine's Public House in the Tropicana as it was right across the street from the MGM where we were staying. I had high hopes for excellent food as he is the first one to criticize others about seasoning and flavours. The service was good and the waitress was attentive. It wasn't that busy anyway yet. We had a Tater-tot Poutine appetizer, and I have to say I was underwhelmed. There was not enough gravy and it was topped with a small sprinkling of Goat cheese and too much meat. Offer it with Fries and put more cheese in it. For the main entree my wife had the shepherds pie, and said it was great, but lacked seasoning a little. There is quite a bit of ground Lamb, so be ready for a Lamb overload.  I had Bangers and mash, and have had Bangers before. I was not delighted with their sausage used. If this is a regional variation then so be it, but I thought Bangers were called that because the casing cracked when cooked. The casings were tough and chewy and the sausage lacked seasoning. The gravy tasted excellent, but the Shitake Mushrooms were very overcooked, rubber and chewy, and too much. The Mash was so-so. The atmosphere of the restaurant was classic Robert Irvine, and seem like a Pub. Lots of beers offered. All in all, I can make a much better Poutine at home, and the same with the Bangers and Mash.",

I had the signature F&K Burger with Tator Tots which was very good.  The uniqueness of the fried bacon sealed the deal.  My wife had the Steak and frites.  Very good, even for a less expensive flank steak cut.  Here's the real issue..... PRICE!!  The place is simply overpriced.  No nice way to put it.  This is Vegas....and there are LOTS of choices.  For three entrees, two adult bevs, one soft drink and tip, $150 is simply too much......considering the entrees were Burger & Flank Steak.  So to summarize.... good tasting food in a good atmosphere with great cold beer that's in an older Hotel and way overpriced.",

Robert Irvine has always been one of my fav food network chefs but this resturant needs his show resturant impossible to come save it. Disaster!!   The place is very nice, large bar but huge. Way to big for the tropicana. I could never see it being full, ever. We arrived around 6pm on a weekend night for dinner and it was very slow. Seated right away. We were handed the menu and i literally didn't know what to think...i thought this was a pub. The menu is all over the place. No sense to direction at all. You'd think a pub would have pub food, but i guess not this one.   We ordered our drinks, they took forever to get to our table with them and to take out order. I cant remember the name of the waitress but she had red hair. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time. The apps took foreber to get to the table as well. You'd think because it was so slow the service would be faster. Not this place. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we even wanted another.   Our apps arrived stone cold! Wings and a pizza. The pizza had so much flour on the bottom, it was disgusting. The wings were horrible quality as well and the ranch tasted like it wasn't held at the right temp.   By the time we recieved our entrees we had waited 45 minutes. I ordered the sheppards pie and my partner ordered steak dish. This place served me sheppards pie without crust. I told our waitress and she said the chef didnt like the way it came out and decided not to serve it with crust. What a waste. I've never heard of a chef just saying f*** it and serving it how they want it. My partners skirt steak was ordered medium and was very chared as well.  Maybe their dessert is good, but our waitress handed us the check without even asking. So we just left. We would of talked tothe manager but he looked busy sitting at the bar watching the game. What a joke this place is.   Robert, you need to work your magic on the menu, food and staff. We are locals that love coming to the strip, probably won't be back.",

It was literally a pile of meat bits and potatoes, topped with mashed potatoes. It was 80% potatoes, Zero crust. When I asked why it had no crust, I was told the chef didn't like the way the crust turned out, so they just covered it with mashed potatoes instead of crust. What?  Does this place not have repeatable recipes?  Every time they make something is trial and error?  The meal was bad. The meat wasn't even good. Needless to say I will never eat there again. Attaching a picture of my \"pie\".",

Great experience and according to our server Mr. Irvine is very personable and comes there often just to socialize with customers. Had a great meal and we will return   As I indicated we came back for a brunch had chicken n Waffles with poached eggs  Individually each item was excellent it was my first time ordering this combination so ate them separately... as one would expect our meal was delicious.

    "text": "Recommended for:   ~really good comfort food! ~Good beer list & interesting cocktails  Visited Robert Irvine's Public House this weekend for dinner.  We were staying at the MGM so it was an easy walk across the bridge from MGM to Tropicana.    We were tired and hungry and hopeful that this place would be good.  IT WAS!    Service was fine, not fantastic as our water glasses were not kept filled, but the server was pretty attentive otherwise and the food came out fast.  They didn't bat an eye that I walked in with my own beer, but I did order a drink later so I guess I evened that out, but I appreciated it.  My husband ordered the Public House Burger.  Its huge, served on Parker House rolls, includes shaved ham AND an egg, and my husband said it was literally the best hamburger he has ever eaten.  I was a little jealous because I love burgers and it looked dang good.  I went with the Pulled Pork Cavatappi and Cheese which is essentially mac and cheese with pulled pork on top.  I was hesitant because everywhere I have eaten mac and cheese in the last year has been a disappointment, but this was DELICIOUS.  The cheesy sauce was creamy AND flavorful with a cheddar taste to it and the pulled pork was perfectly cooked, tender with a tangy and zesty BBQ sauce.  It was wonderful.  I could have eaten more!  Its not huge for a pasta dish that has nothing else with it.  But now, as I write this, I wish I could eat it again.  It is not cheap, but standard Vegas 'TV chef' pricing.  We will definitely be returning... hopefully I'll try something else, but I don't know if we'll be able to with the memory of what we ate!",

Took 20 mins almost to order drinks and 15-20 mins between each interaction after (getting a box, the check, getting the check back) , and I can understand it being a hot night but it was early and not at all that crowded or busy. If you are coming for the pictures on yelp be warned all the things I wanted to order were no longer available.   The ricotta appetizer was good and fresh, my margaretta pizza was absolutely flavorless. No seasoning. the crust was just like flour and water and very disappointing. My husbands burger again was flavorless, the bacon and cheese added a hint of flavor but the meat tasted like nothing at all.  We also did not receive the 50% deal for pizza on the bill for the anniversary deals.   Overall it was the blandest and most disappointing food I've had on the strip so far.",

But, this is Vegas, and competition is tough. In another city, I might have given 3 stars, but the opportunity cost on a short weekend trip is high, and this is a meal that we could have eaten elsewhere.   High points: The beer selection is impressive, and this is a great place to grab a drink on a hot day (which we did). The service was also excellent.   Low points: The food was, unfortunately, not memorable. We got the macaroni and cheese and the peach/burratta salad. The macaroni was a bit too al dente and salty for me and the peaches in the salad were not ripe. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I was not impressed.  I was also sad that they took the french onion fondue off the menu for the summer. Many reviews mentioned it, and again, my husband has been talking it up for months!",

    "text": "3.5 stars... New joint popped up in my radar, and mixed reviews gave me mixed emotions. I've seen the guys shows and he seems to always manage quality as a top priority. Started with the wedge salad. Cool crisp iceberg in a light vinaigrette covered with bacon and tomatoes, sitting in a lagoon of blue cheese dressing. I would have left the vinaigrette dressing off solely for calories consciousness..I didn't think it needed it. Next up was the fish and chips, and at $28 it had big expectations to satisfy. Flaky fish in a perfectly crunchy battered crust sitting atop crispy fries easiness with somewhat melty feta and a curry inspired mayo. It all worked really well together, but I will agree the price tag was a bit ego inflated. Also couldn't pass on the Mac & cheese...gooey melty goodness with all the right textures and flavors. My only complaint was the texture of the bacon was hard and did not match well with the panko as it kept getting caught in my teeth and took away from the crunch. Rounded out the meal with a server recommended(Thanks Michael!) skillet cookie. A larger scoop of ice cream is the only suggestion for this one as I ran out before the cookie was depleted.   Ambiance is upscale barrel house, prices are higher than expected, and staff was prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly!  I rarely add a restaurant to the list on first visit but this one fits the bill. This joint makes the list!",

Other people were apologized too, for not having their beer choice on tap available. It was explained about certain kegs not moving and the menu needed updating. Well, if you're touting youself as having a variety of beer, someone had better get things refilled or updated.

The design of the restaurant is fine, but it is extremely smoky due to the surrounding casino.  The drink selection is fine and the menu choices are what I would expect from a British born chef.  Here is where it starts to go awry.  My wife ordered a chicken dish and when we got it the chicken was bland and the gravy was lukewarm at best.  The potatoes were completely unmemorable even though they took up half of the plate.  I honestly believe the chicken at the excalibur show across the street had more flavor.  The best part of this almost 30 dollar dish was the cauliflower.  Now on to the dish which the waitress described as their signature dish, the fish and chips.  I was expecting crispy tasty breading with flavor and what I received was tasteless and rather soggy.  The French fries were okay, but covered in some kind of weird liquidy mayo concoction.  The bacon even lacked flavor.  My recommendation is as follows.  Dont waste your money on Irvine's place as it really is not worth the money.  There are far better celebrity options like Giada and Mesa grill.  These are slightly more pricey, but well worth the extra coin.  Overall a disappointment and my perception of Robert Irvine as a chef is forever changed.",

They offer a huge dining area and a bar with a lot of tvs for sports.    We sat in the dining area and had great service and good food.  They offer a good selection of beer and wine too.    For dinner we had the Kale salad, some pizza and a few different beers.    I'll be back and I recommend.",

    "text": "Very underwhelmed about this place.  Especially from a food celebrity expectation. Just saying.   The restaurant is Block by slot machines so it is difficult to find.   my friends decided on this place due to seeing a show in the Tropicana. Agreed to meet up for dinner.  Service - 5 stars it was spot on. The waitress even offered to split appetizer on separate bills as their POS system has that option.  Ambiance - the interior and design felt old and tired much like the casino. It felt as though they kept the old interior decor from a previous restaurant in the interest of saving money. not what I expected from a food network celebrity.   Food - croquettes were good. Not sure I would of used tzatziki sauce with croquettes? But ok.   I ordered the shepherds pie. Portion was good. Serviced in a cast iron dish. Food piping hot like it should be. HOWEVER it had so much oil in it I think I might of had a heart attack. Please see my photo for reference. no dish in a restaurant should have a pool of oil sitting in the bottom of it. The pie could of used some more veggies in it too. I've had better.   Yes I could of sent it back - however -  One of my gripes with Vegas restaurants . Many people have a show to attend after dinner. Sending it back to wait for it to be redone properly simply isn't an option due to time constraints.   I tried a bite of my friends fried liver and onions. the liver was tender and flavorful. Crust was a complement and didn't over power the liver.   My friends salmon looked spectacular as far as presentation. I didn't get a chance to try it.   I do recommend their fingerling potatoes. Buttery and creamy on the inside - not dry which I loved.   Walking out I saw a couple of dishes on other tables that looked way more wow than the ones we ordered. Yes I love to stalk other people's plates in restaurants don't judge me .   I feel like this restaurant could of been a crown and facelift to the tired Tropicana - but it managed to blend into the mediocre casino and didn't do anything to impress me.  If you are looking for an amazing pub experience I recommend Gordon Ramsey's pub restaurant inside the caesars palace. it will knock your socks off.",

    "text": "I've watched Robert Irvine on Restaurant Impossible for years and the biggest complaint he has for chefs he works with is that they do not season their food enough.  I think it must have been a long time since Robert has eaten at this location as that was the main complaint from everyone at our table as well - no/not enough seasoning on any of the dishes.  Walking in the atmosphere was very nice.  Pub feel with dark wood, but lots of windows so it did not feel dreary.  We were quite excited to eat/drink here.  The bartender was really nice and let us sample several of the many beers on the menu.  After selecting the ones we liked best we turned to food.  Our table ordered the F&K Fondue burger (you pour the cheese over it)/fries, a Pastrami Rachael sandwich/fries, the potato/chicken soup and a Pepperoni pizza. The best comment from our group was 'the beer is good'.  The F&K Fondue burger was too messy to eat with the cheese, so they just had the burger which was just OK.  The Pastrami Rachael sandwich was good, but one side of the bread was totally soggy.  Everyone at the table felt that the fries had no seasoning at all - not even salt.  Most of them were left on the plates.  I was surprised that the potato/ chicken soup did not have chunks of potato or chicken in it.  I could taste the potato, which was the consistency of mashed potatoes, and found only the smallest of pieces of chicken - nothing like I expected.  The pepperoni pizza was good (not great), but kind of hard to mess that up. :)  All in all it was a very disappointing experience.  I really love Robert but I don't think he knows what the food at his restaurant comes out tasting (or not tasting) like.",

Wings do not come with blue cheese, but he brought it out (even though I didn't ask). Coming back again when in Vegas.",

Meh save ur 26 bucks and go some were else on the strip and get a mediocre steak and a beer. Maybe the chef that is expediting should be off his phone and worry about quality of his food he sends out.         $26 for pie go have a burger and a beer instead on the strip instead of the Guinness steak and pie.

Our server was great help when it came to deciding on drinks   Now the food!!! I had a medley of food to eat. Started off with the keep calm and Cary on, signature drink, and it was amazing! They had a great choice of mixed drinks and an even bigger choice of draft and bottled beers. For appetizers i had the French onion fondue and the lump crab arancini  Oh My Gosh! For the first time have a fondu I hope every other time is as good as this one, the onion the cheese it was purely amazing and delicious. Now the lump crab arancini, heaven sent crab balls!!!!!! Lol, they were sooooooo goood I could I've eaten those and only those, the crab so tender lightly breaded with hints of lemon in the meat! Along with the sauce in the plate became an instant fave! I then went on to have the roasted vegetable salad, absolutely a great salad, I have to be completely honest here and say it wasn't one of my favorite dishes solely because the salad comes with cilantro, and I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, kinda took away from the salad for me, but cilantro aside the rest of the salad along with the tahini dressing was very good! For my entree I had the ponzu glazed grilled salmon, by far the best salmon I've had at a restaurant in a while, the sauce it came with was absolutely amazing and the ponzu flavor was not too salty and just enough hint of lemon, along with the spinach the dish was exquisite  Last and not least desert! I tried the bread pudding which was very delectable! The sauce was delightful and the almond brittle was great!  In all my experience was wonderful and will definitely be returning! Highly recommended for a casual dining experience",

The breading however was too sweet for the savory fish. It wasn't bad, but I ended up eating the fish and the breading separately. The chips were a nice surprise. The server was a conscientious enough to mention they come with green onions, bacon, and cheese. Good flavor, if not a bit salty. This is the kind of place you go to for food that soaks up some alcohol! I don't think I'd seek this place out specifically unless I happened to be in Tropicana for something else and didn't want \"food court\" food.",

Fries were prepared sort-of poutine-like (covered in cheese, etc..).  So to sum it up, I had the fish and chips, free appetizer, and water.  $39 after tip and tax.

    "text": "My wife and I visited Robert Irvine's Public House last night for my birthday. It did not disappoint. We were promptly greeted with personalized service by our hostess who wished me a happy birthday on the spot (Details included on the reservation, very attentive!) and also confirmed our desire for a booth location.  My wife took her seat and I made a quick detour to the restroom before having my seat. The restroom was very clean, by the way.  when I made my return to the table we already had mineral water and lemons on our table. Mind you, we usually have to wait a few extra minutes for lemons but they were certainly on top of it. Our server, Ruben, was outstanding as well. There may be an edit coming later if that isn't his name, I don't have my receipt in front of me.  He was knowledgeable about the beer selection and offered up the soup of the day option without being prompted. Once we ordered, he also kept us constantly informed of the status of our meals until it was delivered. They were busy but it never felt like we were forgotten, which is a strong attribute to their guest service quality.  The beer of the night for me was an Able Baker Chris Kael Impale'd Ale, a local brew with a 10% alcohol level. It was as smooth as can be. A little buzz to start the evening is always a good thing. The beer selection at Public House is impressive but not overwhelming which makes it easier to come to a quick decision on a drink, as opposed to mulling through 3 to 4 pages consisting of hundreds of selections. Not that I don't enjoy a large beer selection at times, but the main event here is the food -- the beer and drink selection should complement the food menu at a restaurant of this variety, not vice versa. Chef Irvine understands and I'm appreciative.  We ordered the chicken fingers and a side of garlic truffle fries for our meal. Again, we share everything. The chicken was seasoned well and cooked thoroughly and I LOVED the garlic truffle fries. They were a nice thickness and not overly saturated with grease. The dip that came with the fingers, a sriracha buttermilk ranch and traditional buffalo sauces were a nice touch. They made great dipping fodder for the fries as well.  We were too full to order dessert, so I can't speak on it for this particular review but we intend on making another trip here in the future. They have definitely earned it!  Bonus: The Tropicana provides FREE parking for their guests as well. That's always a beautiful thing!",

The duck confit was good especially with the sriracha butter sauce. The salmon was good but overcooked to our liking. If you like it medium like I do, make sure to ask for it. The pizza was actually the best thing we had. It's all made from scratch.  The duck confit actually came out under cooked the first time. Our server Fred was on it and took care of us. He took it off our bill and ordered a new dish for me. Chef Shawn brought it out to our table and apologized for the last dish and even offered my dining partner something so she won't have to just watch me eat since she already finished her dish. I am truly impressed how genuinely concerned they were about their mistake and made up for it. We felt taken care of and that's really all I ask for as a customer.",

    "text": "Happy to wander the world seeking out great meals but not so fond of Food Television there was no real reason to know Robert Irvine before the Chef opened up shop at The Tropicana, and although the name Public House still seems terribly unoriginal with two additional Restaurants similarly dubbed less than 3/4 mile away it looks as though the Restaurant Impossible star's spot is doing quite well based on a visit Saturday evening  Reportedly built at the request of Tropicana High Rollers in need of a place to use comps, the property certainly never considered a dining destination in a city filled with several Resorts that could legitimately make such a claim, Robert Irvine's Public House officially opened its doors in July after significant hype including a daredevil stunt during which the TV-Star lept from the top of the white tower over a year prior, Chef Scott Green making his return to Las Vegas after a stint in Canada to head up a kitchen focused on accessible fare and Irvine's British upbringing  Admittedly a first-timer at The Tropicana, its southerly location on The Strip and lack of dining venues never really a draw despite being one of the few places in town still offering free parking, it is upon entering the front doors that signs immediately point guests left towards the sprawling room with a bar and lounge up front plus several tables and banquets lining the space behind, a dinner rush of over 150 covers seeing the place slammed on a big football weekend but a party of four happy to wait until the assigned 8pm reservation time while sitting at a 1st come-1stserve high top.  Doing a reasonable job of isolating itself from the floor, a walkway between slot machines and Public House's doors at least 15 feet wide, it is only once diners make their way to the back that the full scope of design can be seen, varying shades of wood comprising floor and ceilings sandwiching comfortable orange leather seats, stone walls and a big glass window facing Las Vegas Boulevard outside.  Dining with three frequent tablemates and thus able to sample a wide range of the menu it was after others had requested Cocktails and Beers featuring flavors like Peanut Butter and Passion Fruit that Food was ordered, a total of 12 savories far more than would be recommended for even a group of six and beginning with Appetizers including Deviled Eggs atop Mustard alongside Tater Tot \"Poutine\" with Pulled Pork and Goat Cheese plus smoky Wings featuring Irvine's own Buffalo Sauce and 2 styles of housemade Dressing.  By no means a bad way to begin, even those tired of \"small plates\" and \"gastropubs\" likely to find lots to love in the Tots that remain crispy beneath Mushroom Gravy and a bubbling dish of French Onion Fondue meant to be slathered on Toast, it was with some additional Bread requested and Gruyere still molten that a trio of Salads soon appeared, the Heirloom Tomatoes vibrant and acidic amidst fresh Herbs and Garlic while the ubiquitous Beet Salad outperformed many thanks to Grapes and lightly pickled flavors, the same sadly not to be said for a dish simply listed as \"Roasted Vegetables\" that featured good Produce but seemed poorly conceived as the Sauce was too thick to be considered 'Soup' and too runny to function as Dip without getting messy.  Using a pair of bar items plus thick-cut Steak Tartare served with housemade Potato Chips as a sort of mid-course, crowds beginning to dwindle around 9:30, suffice it to say that the much publicized F&K Burger smothered in Cheese is tasty but plenty in its smaller \"Slider\" format while the shrunk-down Fish & Chips unfortunately suffered from Cod being too bland, the bed of matchstick Fries showing far better amidst Bacon, Feta and thickened Vinegar.  Rounding out savories with two items one won't just find anywhere in Sin City, the Buttermilk fried Duck Confit crisp and intensely flavored but balanced by a Jean Georges-esque combination of braised Greens plus \"buttery\" Hot Sauce and Irvine's signature \"Stone Fired Shepherd's Pie\" achieving where many others fail by letting the Potatoes get a little bit crispy which adds texture to the classic Lamb filling, it was with most already stuffed that four Desserts arrived with each presentation proving at least enough to warrant a bite from each...and several more for others.  Part classic and part clever, items like Apple Pie and Blue Cheesecake saved for a later date, it was instead with bites of Robert's famous Banoffee Pie that things got underway and taking a far lighter approach than most to the combination of Bananas and Toffee while mellowing sweetness with Espresso Ice Cream the presentation sets a high bar for the dish locally, the same to be said of traditional Spotted Dick served in warm Vanilla Sauce while the Dark Chocolate Skillet Cookie and \"Dessert Shepherd's Pie\" are definitely best shared, the former as rich as it sounds while the item in cast iron riffs on Trifle with sliced Berries, Meringue and cubes of Pound Cake",

Why does my soup have green things floating in it. Also, took half an hour for not potato soup. Had the steak frites. Was ok. A bit salty and some fatty pieces. Wife got half chicken. How do you screw up chicken. Why cover crispy skin with gravy? Mashed potatoes were definitely instant from a box. A disappointing meal. We had high hopes.",

Everything was expensive with super small portions. I don't think they will make it pass 2 years, but then again, they are the only place open late (close at 11 pm)so customers by default. UPDATE: went this am to ask if standard size of fish and chips was what I got, was told no and manager JP, comped me a meal. That's good customer service. Low stars because at the price I am paying, I shouldn't have had to complain.",

The menu is about as basic as it gets but they still manage to just miss the mark across the board. The manager comped our meal, it wasn't necessary as it wasn't what we were looking for, we just wanted dinner. I had the chicken sandwich, my friend had the Fish and chips, to sum it up, YUCK! Fish was gummy and the chicken sandwich was sawdust. Ordered a Wedge Salad but after 20 minutes the waiter came to our table and said they were out of iceberg lettuce, it was too late to pivot and make another choice. He offered . side salad which was fine but by the time it got to the table the entree' had been there for 5+ minutes so who wants it at that point. Like I said, there are 1000's of places to eat in Vegas on and off the strip, go to one of the other choices, you aren't going to get much worse than this if you make a bad choice.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE service!  Big fan of Robert Irvine's TV shows, so I was looking forward to actually trying some of his 'product' first-hand.   While my horrible experience isn't attributable to him, it left a bad enough impression, plus there are plenty of other great venues in the Las Vegas area, that I have zero desire to give his place a second try.  A friend & I showed-up at about 8:15PM last night (a Monday evening).  No line at the hostess stand, and plenty of dinner tables & seats looked open & ready inside.    The hostess informed us that they'd just cleared out a large group (VMWare convention is in-town), so that they were re-assembling the dining area, a table for us would be ready in \"a couple minutes,\" and that we were welcome to sit at the bar while waiting for our table.    We sat at the bar, & I was happy to see they've got a very impressive selection of beers.  We each ordered one beer.  I'm a 'lightweight' when it comes to alcohol & since I had driven us to the Tropicana, alcohol consumption was a careful event for me.  But because I believed we'd be there for at least an hour and that I'd eat a large meal, I got a beer that sounded interesting, but had a high volume of alcohol in it.   The beer was great. Eventually the bartender asked if we'd like to run a tab, and I said yes, because we were waiting to be seated for dinner, & would like the two beers just added to our dinner tab.    She informed us that wasn't possible -- drinks ordered at the bar had to be paid for at the bar.  OK, a nuisance, but no big deal...  We finished our beers after about 20 minutes, and still had not been seated at a dining table.  We had to flag-down the bartender to pay for the drinks, then we got up & went to the hostess stand, about 12' away & in plain sight of where we'd sat at the bar.  By now, there was a small line of people waiting in-front of the stand, but since we'd already checked-in, we stood towards the side & patiently waited for a couple min.  The hostess made eye contact with us, and I politely mentioned to her -- the same hostess we originally dealt with about 22 min prior (the one who said our dining table would be ready in \"a few minutes\" & suggested we sit at the bar in the meantime) that it'd been a while, & we were still waiting for our table.  She gave us a blank look, and asked my name.   I gave it to her, and she checked what apparently was a waiting list that she was carrying, then said something like \"I don't see your name on the list.\"   Well of-course she didn't -- she never asked for my name when we first checked-in with her.    Without an apology or any sign of guilt, she then had the audacity to add my name to the *bottom* of the list, with about 5 names above it.    Thankfully, there was a second hostess that I think must have known that the other one was incompetent, as she came over immediately afterwards & told us she'd try to seat us quickly.   But only as we were being led to a dining table were we informed by this other hostess that we could have ordered & consumed dinner while seated at the bar. and that for some reason, the only food items they were able to serve that night were burgers, pizzas, and one other type of food, *not* the full menu.  Upon hearing this, we'd experienced enough of Robert Irvine's Public House treatment, and opted to dine elsewhere.  While choosing whether or not I am sober enough to drive a car is always *my* responsibility, the sheer ineptitude we experienced at Robert Irvine's Public House caused us to leave long before we anticipated, and without consuming the food which would have sobered me up enough to get behind the wheel.    Had we just gone there for a beer, or considered that their incompetence could have resulted in us leaving The Tropicana sooner than expected, I would either have not consumed the one beer, or would have chosen a beer with less alcohol.     We ended up having to just kill time wandering around The Tropicana for about 45 minutes before I felt I was safe to drive my car.  Obviously, doing so was important, but it was also more of my valuable time wasted by the incompetent hostess at Robert Irvine's Public House, & as a result, I have zero desire to return to it, and very little interest in even returning to The Tropicana.     As a fan of his various shows, including the one where he'd help train/re-train restaurant staff & owners on customer-service, the irony of my first & likely last experience at one of his own restaurants isn't lost on me.",

The bar is huge and the first thing you see. It gets back up there people waiting for tables however my main point is the bar and tenders are a mess. There were literally 6 guys and 1 lady behind the bar and people had to wait forever to get someone's attention to order a drink while they waited.  The worse thing I experienced was there were 3 chairs next to us and a party of 4 came. They went to pull a chair so they all could sit together and the bartender Chris say no you can't do that, chairs can't be moved! So the guy goes back to his party and stands.. to have dinner and drinks! Completed rude and non services based restaurant that's for sure. There wasn't adding a chair to a full bar and there was a ton of room! Bartender says we can't move chairs because it becomes an unorganized mess like a car accident WTF?!?! That the stupid shit I have ever heard you are not adding additional chairs to create a traffic jam lmao you are moving a chair down to service the paying customer who is eventually going to need to tip you and help you with your life! Worse customer service I have ever seen! But they will let some violent man sit at the bar and scare people.. what a shame we won't be returning.",

We were in Las Vegas for my wife's birthday weekend over Super Bowl weekend. Our uber was late in picking us up and traffic was bad as a courteous guest we called Roberts Irvine's Public House at 3:10 pm to let the hostess staff know we were enroute and 1 mile or less away. We were immediately told \"well we can't guarantee your table now\" in a rude,short, snotty manner. What, we didn't even HAVE to call your business at all. We were only trying to be proactive and communicate as a courtesy. I told my wife \"why would we show up to possibly be told we don't have a table for you\" as it was Super Bowl Sunday and this is why we had made a reservation in advance. We decided why spend a dime in this business with such poor customer service even before arrival. It's sad as 2 weeks ago I was sitting with Robert Irvine at an event in Paradise Valley, Az. I see a training opportunity here as a newer business in which hospitality and guest service has to be a key component in your business model from start to finish of each experience. We chose to spend our money elsewhere,unfortunately.",

My group walked in and ask to sit at a table, hostess sat us at a table that still had waste food from what I can only assume was the last customer. All around us there were multiple tables in the same or worse condition cleanliness wise. And they all remained that way for the entire time we were there, including the table we were sitting at. Staff walking past them and us constantly ignored the mess.  Went to the bar asked for 3 of the listed 100 available beers. No you can only have one...the Guinness has not settled and the Kona is not available...so not 100...who would really know how many are truthfully available.  Made my thoughts known to the hostess, no interest whatsoever...  Place is complete rubbish, avoid it if at all possible by walking no more than 100 yards to any number of better options",

Also, ambiance is suspiciously like an upscale Denny's or a Hilton's breakfast room circa. 1971. Front-of-house management should be handed a copy of the classifieds and their last paycheck.",

I had to send my fries back because they were inedible (cold, hard, and old).  My queso was luke warm to begin with. After I got my new order of fresh fries, cheese bowl was cold. Even then, the fries simply did not taste fresh cut and had no salt. I asked if the burger was supposed to have bacon because I didn't taste or see the bacon in it. The bartender told me it was more like bits and pieces of bacon. The burger was ok. It lacked flavor. I asked for medium rare and it was slightly more towards rare but I'm on with that. We had to eat at the bar due to a 30 min wait but there were several empty tables?  I'm sure it was due to reservations that apparently never showed. The bartenders were nice with great service. I would NOT recommend eating here. The food is not worth it. You get better food and slightly cheaper at the food court across the street in another casino.",

We ordered our appetizer came 15 mins later our entree 30 minutes later and we ordered it with the appetizer. Then we ordered dessert. 30 minutes later I ask the waiter and he says I'll check. He's still checking because it never came. Asked for the check another 20 minutes waiting and no check. So I got up went looking for the waiter and he hands me the check and tells me to fill it out, it was a room charge, and leave it at the register. No thank for visiting. I read an article where Robert says he wants his guests to feel at home well if this is home to him and I don't want to visit again. I felt as if I were begging for my food. I'm giving 1 star because the food was good but I really wanted to try his signature dessert but I guess they went to England to get it",

I would've thought the staff would know the table was broken before sitting us there.  We moved to the table next to us and informed our waiter about the table.  He and another waiter carried the broken table away and then came back carrying what I thought was a new table.  It wasn't a new table cause when another couple asked to sit at that table they were told it was broken.  It was just odd all around.  The service and food were excellent despite the table ordeal.  The iceberg salad was excellent with the homemade blue cheese dressing.  The prosciutto pizza was amazing!  The fig on the pizza created a wonderful flavor profile with the backdrop of the salty prosciutto.  Looking forward to going back at dinner to try the steak or other dinner entrees.",

The manager came over and said he was sorry and the he would comp the fish and chips . I said that would be great !! . The check came and it still had the the fish and chips on it . The bartender asked a second manager ( I forget her name ) what to do she told him the wrong way , then the had to finger again to do it right ( the way the bartender said to do it when he talked to her ) this is going on for 10 to 15 mins . She comes to me and start trying to tell me something and I tell her very nicely that I'm in a hurry . She then rolls her eyes Ike this is my fault . Very poor customer skills  I left and went and got GREAT food at BRio in town square .  Very very poor service , I will tell all my clients and customer to not waste their time with this place .

The first time we ate there Chef Robert was on location and stopped by to talk with us; what a nice surprise. I had the duck confit that was really good. The first time I was there I had the shepherd pie that was also amazing. My wife had the the fish n chips both times and said the flavor was nice but it had more batter on the fish than was to her likings. I'm really glad they have a kids menu which we order off the first time (cheeseburger) but this time the kids slit the fish n chips.  For an appetizer we had the French onion fondue which I would not classify as a fondue but just a regular ole dip. Don't me wrong it was pretty tasty but it only came with 5 pieces of bread so we got a second helping which added 5$ to the menu. It was good but 18$ for an app was more than I really wanted to spend.  Last we hit the dessert menu. Almond cake, I don't need to order that again. It was very underwhelming. The flavor the nuts the peaches were all real flat.  Overall both trips were nice and meeting Chef Robert was awesome. Not sure that I have to go back but since I'm a veteran and Chef Robert treats us nice I probably will.",

Bread was a little stale and not a big fan of the dressing for it. My two last lobster sandwiches were from local food trucks and there were clearly better and tastier. Also had the French onion fondue. Like a mix of cheese fondue and French Onion soup aka cheese sauce with a bunch of onions in it. Hard to scoop up.  I would prefer to have those two dishes separate. The chicken wings were just as good as next door at the Hooters but priced way higher.  Last I had the crab balls. It was hard to taste the lump crab. Again many places have super delish crab cakes in town that I would much rather prefer. Best part Robert Irvine was walking around and giving photo ops. Without Robert in the room, the place is clearly over priced. They should step it up a notch or lower the price. The competition in town is tough. This would not be the first, second or third places I would go to for this kind of food. The room is really loud.",

The attention to detail is top notch. I do have one complaint preventing me from giving it 5 stars. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, the plates were well thought out for the presentation, the table layout is very comfortable. For some reason they choose not to have salt and pepper on the tables??? I requested some and they brought me 2 little shakers that looked as if they were purchased right off  the shelf at the local Piggly Wiggly. I was impressed with the fact that the salt seemed to be a higher quality sea salt or kosher salt. Too bad it wouldn't come out of the shaker as the little holes in the tin cap were too small. Fix this Mr. Irvine and I will be happy to slap 5 stars on this review. I love your food and staff!",

From the moment we sat down at the bar, we were given everything one hopes for when they go out to eat. They were prompt, attentive, and full of information about the restaurant, and all its offerings. While we debated about what to order, Juan suggested something my girlfriend and I had both been looking at, so we ordered it. The burger was made with Creekstone Farms beef which is exceptional, deep fried bacon, sauteed mushrooms and onions, green tomato and lettuce shavings served on a brioche bun and offered with an insane fondue to pour over the burger.  We have been residing in Vegas for two years now, and this was absolutely one of if not our best experiences at any restaurant.  This place is a very fun environment one can plan to either sit and have a nice meal, or sit at the bar as we did, and enjoy great food, sample some wonderful beers, and receive the type of service so few restaurants offer anymore. We absolutely will be back, and recommend this spot to anyone either in town for a vacation or any local seeking a nice new place for some great food and beer.  Thank you again Juan, and Hans for making it a memorable evening!",

But, judging by the size of his photo on the side of the Tropicana tower, he must be a big deal.  If you're wondering where the restaurant is located, just stand outside and walk towards the Hooters Casino next door.  PH is hard to miss as it looks like the newest construction to the Trop in 60 years.  Here there's plenty of parking and it's free.  The restaurant's really nice and with plenty of space.  Right up front is the U-shaped bar area with two dozen or so taps easily in sight.  Next to that is a wide lounge area great for parties.  When I was here, there was a bachelorette party next to a group from a convention.  There's even shuffleboard.  There's so many tables in the dining area, you probably won't need to worry about reservations.  There was so much good stuff on the menu, I couldn't decide and was taking forever.  So I just went with the F&K Burger ($22) which had crispy bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms.  It did not disappoint.  Juicy and topped with a fluffy shell of a bun.  I also went with the Ahi Tuna Sashimi ($17) which was nice light dish and tasted so fresh.  As my food was coming out, I did some Yelping and I really wanted that Miso Salmon, but was sad to see it wasn't on the menu.  Guess I'll have to come back for that. and the steak. and the pizza.",

When I wanted to order a corn chowder soup and asked if it's not spicy, the waiter brought a sample for me to try. It was, so I ordered baked whipped ricotta and didn't regret about it. That was delicious. Afterwards I had salmon entree which was also very good. My husband was less lucky: he ordered a burger, but he was brought a wrong one. We were in rush to catch the flight, and we got a right one very fast with apologies. I appreciate such an attitude. I would go back here again when I will be next time in Las Vegas.",

We had the all white chicken and broccoli pizza ( great for people who don't like broccoli). Now who would have thought broccoli works on pizza? It does! Had the steak chimachurri, nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. Staff is very attentive. Dining is casual. You got 3 screens off the bar to watch your games. Here's some advice- get larger screens like 80 inch-you'll attract that sports crowd that goes with the brewery. Dessert had the toffee pie- highly recommended. Great for groups. Also would recommend a happy hour menu please.",

Came at an odd time- 3:00 pm so probably got great service because of it but my food was absolutely amazing!!  There was flavor, a little spice, acid and richness.  This dish was so well balanced and seasoned spot on.  The only critique I could find is the potatoes were a little hard.  By the way I ordered the salmon dish.  Oh and it had warm black olives in it which I absolutely love.  I was not sure how I would like them in there but they complimented it very well.  Juan was my server and such a friendly guy with a sweet smile that lightened up the room.  This is a definite treasure for the Tropicana!!!",

The salmon was recommended so we orderd 2 of those, brussell sprouts weren't cooked all the way and salmon was a little over done. Others in our party ordered the burger which he was pleased with and the other person ordered the fish n chips that she didn't finish so I'm not to sure. I notified the waiter of the situation with the rib tips and nothing was done. For the over price and value of the meal I wasn't satisfied. But, I always give something a second chance so maybe if we stay there on the next trip will consider. But, save you money the Bacio is a better place to eat.",

It wasn't enough choice for us but we were sad to miss the experience. Luckily half the team stayed an extra day and we were able to make a reservation and eat from the regular menu. They aren't listed on open table and are kind of hard to find on the internet as there are other Public House that come up first.  But it was fairly simple to make a reservation.  Service was very friendly and attentive.   First, I ordered the spicy martini. Ita a delicious blend of Serrano pepper vodka and pineapple and orange juice. This is a great cocktailI. It definitely had a strong kick but very delicious. Three other people tried it because I was raving about it and agreed. Then, I ordered liver & onions (but with no onion) and was not disappointed. Liver was tender and very flavorful. One of the best liver & onions I've had. Ambiance is nice but casual. I'll definitely be back.",

Yes. YES! Ki had a genuine smile and truly seemed to care about each of the tables she had. We got our bill and were surprised there was already a gratuity for just the two of us. We broke our own rule and tipped up to what we normally would have.   We returned the next night and asked to sit in her area. As soon as we sat down she came over, \"I am so glad you came back! I don't know what happened last night. I am so sorry that the gratuity was on your bill!!!\" She was embarrasses by the mistake and was just as fantastic as the night before.   This time I had the skirt steak that was prepared wonderfully and upgraded my fries to the deliciousness of the night before.   If I'm staying at the Tropicana again I will come back. Not just for Ki, but also for the food. Who am I kidding? I'll be back when I know Ki is there!!",

We start off with the garlic Parmesan rolls they are fresh baked and a iron skillet and the quinoa chicken soup. The soup is one of the best around, like o my god good, well done chef, my only thought is, why the saltines with the soup and not a Parmesan roll is it a nostalgic thing?   For our dinner we got the Robert and Gina sausage chili pizza and the carbonara mac & cheese the Burrata Nevada stone salad and cucumber tomato side salad.  You know Chef Irvine is not going to disappoint and it would be \"Impossible\" for it to be bad.   I think the soup and Burrata salad were my favorites.  This is a place I will be coming back quite often and if your visiting Las Vegas this is a must visit I give it 1 Michelin star!",

It turns out he was quite a hero (my interpretation not his) the night of the Mandalay Bay shootings and helped the victims who had run into the Tropicana.  As he was sharing his story he mentioned how it has changed his outlook on life, eat that ice cream. Have that extra glass of wine, you never know. At that moment I decided to order the Pulled Pork cavatappi. I waS going to stay with my healthy low carb choices but changed my mind and I'm so glad I did. It was fabulous. The bbq sauce was so good, the pork was tender and the \"Mac & cheese\" Mmmmmmmm!  Thanks Jeremy!  Jiovanni our waiter was also very nice and attentive.  Good job, Robert Irvine!",

Everything was amazing but I really have to admit what made he experience was our amazing!!!! Service. Gosh I feel so bad I can't remember his name from a few days ago I think it started with a j? Seriously he was amazing a man who obviously loves and breathes hospitality, he made us want to stay and try more things and mentioned a beer dinner that we most certainly will be checking out. So happy we gave this place a shot! Well definitely be returning soon!  Updated: Jeremy! His name was Jeremy, ask for him he is amazing!!",

The yellowtail poke was pretty good.  A little spice, served with greens.  Overall a nice starter.  The PLT was next.   Pork belly, lettuce and tomato sandwich.  It looked great, but the pork belly was flavorless, and tasted a little spoiled.  I sent it back.   As a replacement, I ordered the lobster roll.  It was basically a 2 inch mini loaf of bread, with a little lobster salad on top.  It was about the size of your average slider.  The lobster salad tasted mostly of cilantro, and as it was served, I couldn't pick out up and eat it like a sandwich.  There mini loaf was not cut with the lobster salad put into the loaf.  Instead the salad was just stacked on top.  There was no way to pick it up and take a bite.  The bill was about $45, including an iced tea, and they did not charge me for the PLT.  The service was very good, but overall three good was a disappointment.",

When we got there, we were told we couldn't be seat prior to our reservation.  We waited in the casino until our reservation time only to be seated at a table near the bar.  Apparently reservations don't guarantee you a decent table. After the hostess seated us, we didn't see a server for about 30 minutes.  The food was good especially the Blue Flame wings.  They had a great flavor and were not overly hot.  Great price on the beer specials.  I left disappointed with the service, but the music, food, and beer was great.

Our receipt said the bartender's name was Nichol, but have no idea since he didn't introduce himself. Food came and we had no water, bartender gave my husband a napkin but not me. This was after waiting 20 minutes to get drinks, yet the place was not busy. Pastrami sandwich was lackluster to say the least.  French Onion Fondue was amazing, but we asked for more toast and were ignored by the bartender. Obviously there's a reason this place is never that busy.  For the name attached to the restaurant, the service should be much much better.  This was 8pm on 6/15.",

After we got our meals we barely saw him again. Waiting to order desert I watched as he chatted at the bar with coworkers. By the time he remembered us we decided we'd rather leave than order any more. Very disappointing service.",

Once we ordered our drinks and food at the same time because we figured it would speed up the service... drinks didn't arrive until 15 minutes later. We complained to the waiter and he rushed the drinks out and he apologized for the delay.  Food did come out quickly and the manager apologized several times. Food was good when it arrived. No complaints there.  Bottoms line, service is less than average and unfortunately, we weren't the only customers that had the same experience as we did.",

My luck turned around when I spoke to the manager, Marcos, and I informed him of what was going one as it was not the waitress or the runner. I don't want to go I to detail to skew anyone from going here. Once I let Marcos know my concerns he went the extra 1000 miles to complete service recovery. In was very professional and made everything right on the spot, no questions asked. Thank you Marcos and thank you to the owner as you have a great place of business and they way you treat your customers.   Thank you for making or stay enjoyable!",

The free drink replacement was also disappointing. The only redeeming quality was our server, who tried her best to compensate for an otherwise crappy meal.",

    "text": "Perhaps Mr. Irvine has set this up to be for a future episode of Restaurant: Impossible...  My two stars are for two items - the draft beer selection and the Public House Poutine.  The wife and I were excited to experience a dinner at a new celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas.  We were seated immediately on a Friday night (that should have been our first sign).  There beer selection is impressive and this is the reason for one star.  The wife and I decided to start with an appetizer and we chose the Public House Poutine.   The wife couldn't get over the initial smell (probably from mushrooms), but I really enjoyed it.  There was a lot of flavors and it was tasty.  I devoured all off this gravy goodness.  This is the reason for star #2.  The dinner went downhill after this.  I ordered fish and chip.  It was very bland and just one large fish.  The batter and fish lacked any seasoning.  The fries had some thing like egg on them, but wasn't quite sure what it was.  I left 3/4 if the dish on the plate. The wife got the Public House burger and ate less than quarter of it before she was finish.  The wife felt that I make better fries (from the frozen store bought one) than she was served.  For some strange reason, there was lack of salt and pepper on the table - every table!  Now to the rest of our experience - the service was less than desired.   Glasses were left empty.  Server all seemed rushed.  Not once did the staff asked how the food was.  The list could go on. When we asked for the check with 3/4 of our food still on the table and said no to a doggie bag, the waitress looked confused, but never asked if something was wrong with the food.  We weren't looking to have this comp'd but wanted the staff to care.     Over all, I wouldn't come here for more than drinks and appetizers. The decor along with the sub-par food and weak service made this place feel more like a hotel Cafe.   We will not be back.",

    "text": "Robert, your own restaurant needs severe help! Super disappointing on nearly every level. Let's start at the beginning shall we...first of all it wasn't busy at all (only about 1/3 of the  tables were occupied) and we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a 4-top table. I guess it's my fault for not recognizing this as a sign to run the other way. Next complaint is the food. We just ordered appetizers to share, which we would typically expect to be no more than a 15 minute wait, but it was over 30. Steak tartare was warm & flavorless, chicken wings cold and dry, unexpected large chunk of brown papery yellow onion skin found in the mushroom pizza. I do have to say the Poutine was awesome though. After the steak tartare was a flop, our servers suggestion of the Korean Spareribs was superb & delivered to the table while still hot. Due to the problems we had, our server went and talked to the manager and comped both the tartare and the pizza. I mean it's nice that they were comped, but I really just wanted to speak to the manager. He apparently was too busy doing nothing to come by though & just said bye to us on our way out when he should have been helping his staff. Also on our way out we noticed how the food temps came out all wrong. The food runners are pulling things out from under the heat lamp and placing them on trays while they wait for the rest of the items to be made, not only is this not appetizing, but it could be unsafe. Food should be delivered as it becomes ready. It's way more reasonable to have things delivered separately and at the correct temp than wrong temp but all delivered at once. And finally our server, now granted he was probably overwhelmed by the kitchen problems that the manager wasn't assisting him with, but never got any water refills during our long wait, and he realized after he had charged my card that one of the items he was going to remove was not actually gone, so more waiting while he deleted and rebilled. Really the whole experience was a train wreck & I expected so much more from the man that fixes so many restaurants with the exact same problems",

The fish in the fish and chips was greasy and bland, while the \"chips\" (skinny fries) were served \"loaded\" and were not very good. Prices were high for what you got. We got 2 desserts between the three of us, the bacon-coated cheesecake that the waiter swore was fabulous was awful, and the spotted duck with vanilla cream sauce was sticky and clumpy.

    "text": "Mixed experience. The downside is a shame, because it is a simple fix- Robert Irvine's nickel and dime's customers to an outrageous extent. We sat at the bar and had a slightly ornery yet fantastic bartender that we enjoyed. You could tell from chatting with him that that he feels walled in a bit by the curmudgeonly nickel and diming that takes place at this really nice space. One example- we had a fantastic appetizer that was almost like a deconstructed grilled cheese (it was called something like a french onion fondue). There was quite a sizable amount of the fondue, but not enough of the excellent thinly-sliced crostinis (unless you little doused them in a disgusting amount of the fondue). We only ate about 1/2 of the fondue and then asked if we could each get one crostini more- we were told it would be 5$ extra for a basket of them and the bartender seemed quite embarrassed by this fact. It was already 14$ for the appetizer. A great resto wants customers to be satisfied, and wasting 1/2 the appetizer because you are so cheap to not give enough bread to complete it is just off-putting and made us not want to return which is too bad because the bartender was excellent and the appetizer tasty as can be. The bartender's attention to detail with drinks was A+ quality! He surely was a craft cocktail bartender.   There is also no Happy Hour and the bar was highly empty on a Saturday in April. I wonder if others are also put off by the nickel-and-diming. Something must be off because the space is really nice...not sure we'll be back.",

Such a shame, because we have wanted to try Robert's restaurant for some time. Unfortunately we never will.",

    "text": "As a Vegas local, we always have to check out the new eats in town. Robert Irvine's Public House opened last week and we ate here opening weekend.   There's a giant glass wall at back of the restaurant facing MGM with an intriguing view of the walkway along LV Blvd.  My recommendation is to ask to sit along side the window when you visit.   You have to accept it for what it is... it's a modern pub. As such, if you're expecting a five star dining experience because of the celebrity chef owner, you may be disappointed. But if you come with the understanding that this is an upscale pub you will likely be highly impressed.   As a vegetarian I ordered the mixed heirloom tomato salad & grilled ciabatta, triple cheese pizza, and dark chocolate panna-cotta. With the exception of the pizza the food was presented in a very creative fashion and was delicious. My mouth is watering thinking about it. When they brought out the pizza I had to point out that the kitchen forgot the pesto and arugula-- I understood, it was opening weekend. Taste-wise I would recommend the heirloom tomato salad and panna-cotta for any future eaters. I really enjoyed them.   My husband ordered the French onion fondue and the pastrami rachel. He could not have liked the French onion fondue more and raved about it, but was slightly disappointed with the pastrami taste-wise. Once he reminded himself he was eating a $17 sandwich at a pub and not a steak at a fine dining establishment he was perfectly satisfied with it. Again, I wouldn't expect fine dining.   Overall it was great and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone. Great for large groups, small groups, kids and adults alike.  Would be perfect for a weekday dinner or a weekend brunch on the south strip.",

This is very un-pub like & just looks like any generic hotel restaurant.   As for the food, I wasn't wowed.  When you are paying almost $25 for a burger & fries -- that better be the best burger & fries you've had, and I would rank this far below even a chain standards.  Portions are very large, if that matters to you, but honestly it just felt kind of wasteful since I didn't even want to eat everything.",

It was basically empty (we were there the day after Christmas) so we were sat quickly which was appreciate it.  Our server took a while to get to us but no big deal since we weren't in a rush. I got the F&K Fondue burger and my boyfriend got the Public House Burger. Pricey burgers but I guess that comes with dining in Vegas.  The fondue burger was fun- the novelty of being able to pour the cheese over whatever you want is definitely a good time but it does get SUPER messy. Burger was a little overcook.  Had a bit of the public house burger and it was decent- nothing special but good. However, after we left my boyfriend started feeling ill but we thought it might have been the drive. He couldn't keep down any food we had after that and was sick all night. He felt better the next day so we ruled out the flu. We suspected it was the burger since that was the last thing he ate before he got sick.   It was a bummer and we probably won't go back- there are plenty of other burger places on the strip.  Edit: I appreciate the personal response (and message) from the owner- and yes, of course there is the standard \"disclaimer\" about raw/undercooked food but seeing that the only thing that was not fully cooked through was the ground beef in the burger at a primarily burger place... still disappointing.",

The ahi sashimi tasted ok but poorly executed. Everything was just piled onto mini toasts that couldn't be picked up due to the stacked on mess.  I ordered the F&K burger.. what a mess. I requested medium and received medium well in a lake of cheese sauce. There was 3 times as much sauce on the plate as on the burger!  This caused my bun to become soaked and subsequently superglued to the plate. The Panko crusted bacon (who does this) was floppy and greasy.   My partner ordered the Guinness pie.. while not as gristly as other reviewers there was a couple pieces. Additionally it seems the chef neglected to use basic seasoning such as salt and pepper making for a bland sauce.   The service also left much to be desired. The lack of knowledge about the drink menu was clearly evident. Service was slow and inattentive as I was clearly not eating and seething for some time. Finally when leaving the two hostesses couldn't even be bother to offer a good evening or anything.   While I appreciate the management did deduct 25% for my burger after having offed to remake it (no thanks it wouldn't fix poor food quality) I would not recommend this as a place to eat.  The entire menu is completely overpriced for what you receive.",

Also the fish and chips was delicious.   I also got the chicken soup and it was rich in flavor and delicious on this cold night.     Thank you for the great hospitality, team Robert Irvine restaurant and Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas Nevada.  Another good thing about this restaurant is the comfort of the tables and the chair.",

I ordered the K&F (Knife and Fork) burger and upgraded my fries to Tots.   The burger was over cooked. Myself and my friend both ordered the K&F and both ordered them med-rate. Oddly, his was perfect and mine was medium. I wasn't going to wait for a replacement so I ate it as-served. The cheese sauce on top of mine was cool, not warm. I still ate it. It was decent.   The tots were great. They were the plain ones too.   My wife had the Shepherds Pie. It was hot and tasty.   Our other friend ordered the Steak Frites and subbed the Frites for double asparagus. We all tried her steak. It was decent.   Our server, Scott was friendly and helpful.   All in all, a decent meal albeit a couple of misses.",

    "text": "So I watched Mr. Irving's show on television and enjoyed it very much. I like his no nonsense approach to owning and operating a business. I had always hoped that I could experience his cooking vision first hand and now I have.  For lunch we stopped by Public House at the Tropicana. We were warmly treated and seated. Our friendly and helpful server took our drink order and delivered our drinks promptly. I got the perfect point of Guinness here and even though I prefer it at room temperature I gave it some time to warm up and it was excellent.  For lunch I ordered the fries to share and a ph salad to start. For my entree, the shepard's pie. Now I have to say one thing. To me it's not shepard's pie unless it has ground lamb. I appreciate greatly that Mr. Irving did nto bend to Americans odd relationship with lamb and put it on the menu as it should be.  Our starter arrived very promptly and the fries were excellent. Crispy, cheesy, and salty. I have had similar versions of fries but this undoubtedly was the best I have tasted. My salad to was excellent. A small mix of veggies and an amazing vinegrette.  My entree arrived and it looked and smelled amazing. Bite after bite brought me back to my many long trips to England where I would visit my friends. The pubs we gathered and the food we ate there. His shepard's pie is absolutely delicious.  For dessert I tried something very new to me. English Bonaffee Pie. A beautifully presented wedge of pie filled with banana, creme, and toffee. Offered with a side of espresso gelato. The flavor is absolute and undeniably delicious. Even my lunch mates were forking at my dessert plate. To die for.  I will definately be back and would recommend Mr. Irving restaurant to anyone.",

We didn't make a scene or even say high to the him, but Chef Irvine was cordial and polite to the 2-3 people that wanted to interrupt him for a photo. He also walked over and greeted a family after one of his servers made the request of him. Pretty classy for a guy that obviously has better things to do.  My ONLY gripe would be how open the restaurant is to the casino/resort... I wish it was a little more intimate.   The entrance is open with a lounging area, sofas and shuffleboard, stuff to keep visitors engaged. The bar is inviting and the craft cocktails were pretty solid, and reasonably priced for Vegas.  I remember I had a cheese-coated burger, I cannot recall the name, it was messy, but satisfying. I don't recall with the wife had, but we both left pleased and full.  Good experience and certainly recommend to anyone staying on the south end of the strip.",

We were greeted and seated by a lovely young woman and our server was at our table quickly. It is a beautiful and spacious restaurant on the inside of a hotel. Copped a bottle of Rose, because they have solid wine deals, to start and I began with the seasonal soup, I refused to ask what type of soup was being served and let my gut take action and, dude, it paid off, their French onion soup is SMACKIN'. My picture shows the \"cup\" of soup, so the bowl must be a cauldron size, I'm a soup guy now.  Moving on, I hit up the Fish & Chips in attempt to get some fried foods in my belly but didn't know how well I'd take to heavy food, whatever, send it.  The Fish & Chips was a perfect portion with some awesomely cooked fish on top, light and crispy on the outside and delicate on the inside and a heaping helping of fries right under that fish. Not sure how but I maxed the whole dish and obviously downed the French onion soup with ease.  Hats off to you Mr. Irvine",

We decided to get late lunch here since we were already there.   We were seated right away and the restaurant was pretty empty. Once we were seated it took a long time for someone to come over to us. We ordered right away when someone did come over and then it took a very long time to get our food. No one came over again and we had to flag someone down to get our check which also took forever. The only times we saw someone was to order, when they brought our food, and when they took our checks.   The food was pretty good. We got the shoestring fries, two wagyu beef sliders, and the baked whipped ricotta. The ricotta was our favorite, but we liked all of it.   All in all, I probably wouldn't come back because even though the food was pretty good, the service was terrible.",

Chicken Tender Appetizer-  F-  Horrible batter, flakey and also lacked salt.  Why not make it in a similar batter as the Fish n Chips?  MF Burger- C-  Hard stale bun- not the best burger.   Fish n Chips - B-  Good but lacked consistency.    Salmon and Brussel Sprouts -  A -  Cooked perfectly.  Best thing I ate today was the salmon & complimentary garlic rolls.  These Chefs are popping up around Vegas due to their name recognition,  Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen is across the street.   It's disappointing to see such outlandish critics of other people's restaurants / food when their own food is sub-par at best.",

Unfortunately that was the best part about my meal.  For dinner I had the steak and frites. It's a very small steak and I'd be almost willing to bet a paycheck that mine was not 10 oz. as claimed. It's really just skirt steak, very thin. However it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and it did have flavor. I liked the chimichurri that accompanied it. For myself to dine here it was $80. All I had was 2 sliders, an entree and one Cocktail. For that price I probably won't be coming back. They don't even have happy hour. When going to a pub your going for leisure and value. You are definitely not getting value here. I recommend Taps across the street at mgm. Way better pricing, and larger portions.   Side Note: service was good and attentive!",

Started off with naked buffalo wings served with pickle chips, celery, ranch dressing on top of grill baguette slice.  Wings were a little small, but delicious, piping hot and dressed with the right amount of wing sauce.  I then had the perfect medium rare PH burger with the fondue sauce served on the side for dipping my pomme frites in.  Burger was in proper proportion to the toasted bun size, bacon slices and onion ring straws added a nice crunch, and the burger was a juicy delight.  Ok go ahead a complain the burger the fries was $22, 6 wings $14, hey its Vegas.  Still fun, I would go back.",

Sat down and our server came and told us the specials and offered the drink selection. We ordered drinks and waited. We got our drinks which were all jverpriced but it's the strip. That's ok, we know what we were in for coming to the strip. We ordered our food and after waiting 45 minutes, nothing. We ordered oysters and salads which didn't show up. It's not even busy !! Soon it reached an hour with not only no food, but no sign of our waiter. We soon located our waiter and asked for the bill. No apology just left. Soon we were greeted by some random person but whom we can only assume was the manager for a haphazard \"sorry and that if we want to come back after the  hockey game we will take care of you\". No clue the guys name or title since he decided to leave that piece out. What an awful place. Everyone around us was served, even individuals whom came after us and it wasn't even busy!!!. Don't come here if you would like to actually eat. Just come for drinks, at least you'll be served those before they forget about you.",

I'd never heard of watermelon radishes, they do have a peppery flavor you would expect, but it's also unexpected.

I had confidence in Chef Irvine so I took a leap of faith and ordered it off the menu. Soooooo happy that I did.  Sorry, Mom, but this was THE BEST liver and onions I have ever had !!!! Husband had the Guinness shepherds pie and said it was good. House salad was a perfect size. Ordered the lemon curd dessert and the meringue topping was dreamy. Our waitress was very nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because some of the timing was off. We got our entrees very fast ( almost too fast ) but then waited for drinks to be refilled and waited for entree plates to be picked up and waited longer for our desserts than we did for the entree and then waited for check. Very clean, Tropicana not my favorite but you don't have to walk in very far to get to the restaurant. Likes the music playing also. Will definitely come back. Oh husband had the mason jar apple pie and ate every bite. I couldn't finish my lemon curd dessert, it was really more a 2-person dessert. Has the blueberry mule cocktail, very good. Hubby enjoyed Robert's margarita.",

    "text": "I was excited to try Robert Irvine's since we were staying at the Tropicana and the food choices are somewhat limited.  As a vegetarian. I asked if they had a separate menu for vegetarians/vegans. The host said no, but they could customized a few options and she told us to ask our server.  So we went in, we were shown to a lower table with the most uncomfortable chairs ever. (The  frame of the chairs were made out of some sort of hard wood, I guess.  They didn't hardly have much of a back to them and the arms came up really high.) I asked the server for options that she could recommend for me.  She said we don't have many, this is mostly a meat place.  We should  have left then, since it seemed like my questioned annoyed her. I knew my husband was tired and hungry, so we stayed.  I ordered the BLT with cheddar cheese/without the bacon and a side salad with no cucumbers. My side salad was full of cucumbers. The BLT looked like one you would get from Sonic, but worse.  I basically got texas looking toast that they called brioche bread with some shredded iceberg lettuce, a few sprinkles of  some sort of shredded cheese, one tomato slice and a little bit of avocado mayonnaise.  I wished I would have taken a picture, but I didn't. I was so busy looking at this $15.00 sandwich that I was going to force myself to eat.  I scraped off the iceberg lettuce, which the little bit of the cheese that I had came off with it.  (I really expected much more from a celebrity chef's restuarant)  I would have been ashamed to have served that sandwich to anyone.  So my husband ordered the Shepard's Pie.  It was the worst Shepard's Pie that he has every had. (He was actually feeling ill for the rest of the night). Then we  go ahead and ordered the peach cheesecake, thinking something had to be good.   The cheesecake was actually the only thing that was good.  Not sure how most of  the other reviews are glowing, but we will never eat there again.  It seemed like the only people that were happy there were the ones sitting at the bar.   It  was our worst meal that we had in our 6 day Vegas stay.",

Loved the sauce and even the bread that the wings were on was great soaked in the sauce.  Spouse had the burger that comes with the cheese sauce either poured over it or on the side if you prefer.  He ordered it medium rare and that's how it came out.  He totally enjoyed it even though it was really out of his comfort zone.  I ordered the blackened Mahi. Wow, was that good. I would order that again for sure.  I'm not a beer lover so I had a margarita, it was well made.  The service was really attentive, even a bit over attentive as we had 3 different people check on us but I'm not complaining.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is the cost of the alcohol is too high in my opinion.  Some of the beer prices are good but if you don't drink beer the drinks are pretty high for what I consider on the small size. But I would certainly go back for the food.  I'm glad I convinced my spouse to try it since he is one who  is pretty traditional about food and when we first looked at the place when we arrived at the Tropicana he was not interested in trying it.",

Food is way overpriced.  Plus I was playing in the casino and was going to go eat an had a drink in my hand and the said \"no outside drinks are allowed\".  Are you kidding me.  Your restaurant is in a casino!  What do you expect.  You mean to tell me if you spending money on the casino floor and you have a drink in your hand they turn you away.  To me that's BS.  But my dumb ass gave them a 3rd try.  It was 3:45 in the afternoon.  And they gave me this little card with very few options and nothing on there was good.  They didn't even have a salad on the menu.  Then the hostess said you can sit anywhere but then she came over and said.  Oh I'm sorry you can only sit at the bar right now cause we're not open for dinner yet.  Bottom line is.  For a celebrity with his name on this establishment is not making him look good.  Oh.  And by the way.  I went there at 10:15 and the yelp review said they closed in 11.  I went there to order some wings to go and they said that they closed early but online they said they were open till 11.  Please don't go here.  Go to the M resort. Their is a free shuttle from the Tropicana.   Better food.  Better staff and more options for the same price.  I'm a local.  I know the difference",

    "text": "If anyone has ever been to Vegas, they know how difficult it is to choose a restaurant due to the vast selection. We were in the South Strip area and decided to check it out. The establishment is located inside the Tropicana right off the casino on the main level. It was 7pm on a Friday night but not as busy as expected, especially since it was Labor Day weekend. Our server Fred was awesome. Very attentive and had good recommendations. The menu is small but great selections nonetheless. We started with poutine. Unlike the traditional version, tater tots were used in place of fries. The gravy was a pulled pork and shiitake onion gravy with peppered goat cheese. All the flavors really complimented each other well. For entrees I opted for Stone Fired Shepherds Pie and my boyfriend had the Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings. All were Robert Irvine's signature dishes. The shepherds pie, was good and exactly what I expected it to taste like. The minced lamb had a good flavor and the mashed potato crust was light and fluffy yet toasted just enough on top. My boyfriends wings had great flavor but his only complaint was that they were only luke warm. He hates to complain so we really aren't sure if the way they are cooked had something to do with the temperature since they are hickory smoked and not fried? He loved them nonetheless and we would return again if ever in the area.",

The water being spilled on us by the bus boy should have been an omen. Our server tried very hard ro keep us happy as we waited over for our entree.  No bread, crackers or anything were offered as we waited.  Fifteen minutes before our meal arrived we were told it was being plated.  Finally our chicken came that we were all sharing and it was fair at best.  Vegetables were fair. Certainly not worth the long wait.  We were told that the chicken dish takes 45 minutes - that should be clearly stated on menu or mentioned by the waiter.  We asked to talk to manager whose attitude was ambivalent at best. Will not return will discourage anyone I know from going",

Took over twenty minutes for one of the two working (bar was less than half full) for one to notice and asked if I wanted another beer. Really? This is service you'd see on one of the namesakes show. What a joke. Will never come back again next time in town. Doubt it'll be around based on the other reviews.",

I was able to order a Bloody Mary even tho it wasn't on the menu. We had delicious chicken wings as an appetizer. Cooked perfectly and has a delicious sauce. The best burger I have had ever was here! It's the a fondue burger. Delicious,  the beef is seasoned to perfection, panko crusted bacon, melty cheese on a toasted brioche bun!  Go get this burger ASAP. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is pretty large. Wished there could have been some Robert Irvine shows playing in the background. He is the face of the place. Can't wait to go back.",

The service was impeccable. The hostess was very nice and our server Raquel was personable as well as charming. The food was great. Shoestring fries were perfect way to start off with our drinks. Wood oven pizza, fig goat cheese and prosciutto was delicious. And the blue-cheese cake very usual and pleasantly velvety. The Irish coffee was probably the best I have had in a long while. I wish I was out here longer because I would love to try more items off the menu!!",

    "text": "Very casual which is nice, well designed interiors ~      This is a new restaurant on \"The Strip\" so that was our reason to try, & neither myself or husband had been inside the Tropicana....... nicer than I expected and had been modernized, SURPRISE! and The Trop offers free parking so that's a PLUS also        Let's start with drinks ~ we each ordered \"specialty\" cocktails. A Rum punch for me and a Libra something for the hubby. Both were pricy, to be expected on the Strip, however it seemed to take awhile to get our drinks (and the restaurant/bar wasn't anywhere near full,) Saturday night 6pm ~ this is early for Vegas!!! Anyway the drinks appear.....mine looked like a mini cocktail, I even commented, which I don't do, but I felt this was outrageous! My cocktail tasted good, just small ~ my husbands drink was good and a more fitting size for the price $$$$$      APPETIZERS ~ we ordered the Lump Crab  Aranchini, just SUBERB! And we were both surprised how crispy golden brown served with a SIRACHA sauce (wasn't scorching & and I am a hot sauce sissy!) DEFINITELY ORDER THESE      The Heirloom Tomato  Salad, beautifully presented and tasted as DEEELISSSH as it looked looked! Ofcourse Heirloom Tomatoes are seasonal so beware what time of year this is on the menu~      Main Courses ~ were DELIVERED before we were half way finished with the Heirloom Tomato Salad.......the food runner stood there as wee looked at him kinda surprised......then he asked IF we wanted him to take it back???? We said no, fearing our plates would be placed under heat lamps plus my fish & chips couldn't survive a reheat  we did mention this to our server, who seemed appalled ~ well HELLLLOO, it's the servers fault! Not the kitchen, as the server keys in the order and needs to time their tickets~      I had the Fish  & Chips  ~ this was not something I would usually order however the menu was limiting for my tastes ~      The coating on the fish was malted beer batter and served golden brown~ on the menu it comes with a curry sauce, which I asked for on the side....thank goodness as I think it would have made the fried crust mushy (Ewww!) PLUS we not curry people. I did try the sauce, it was OK, mustard like with curry. Remember this is an English Pub style eatery and the English do like curry..... still seems odd curry or Mustard with fish.      My Husband had The Skirt Steak served with chips (fries) & asparagus ~ the presentation was Ok & he said is was alright~      We did not order a dessert, however did see many passing by....appeared to be GENEROUS in size ~       The wait staff were eager.....always asking to clear our plates while still eating....this is a training issue ~ constantly filling barely touched water glasses ~ our server was very eager to give us his card once he learned we were locals, like BEFORE we got our cocktails, so we could ask for him upon our return.   Overall I don't see going back for a meal, and would order a different cocktail,  however the apps/Salad were all worth it!!",

Hard to converse over dinner without sitting close and straining your ears and voice and I found it pretty stressful actually and headache inducing.  Wasn't over the top decibel-wise but the acoustics make it like a bass trap- like a bad seat at a concert- mushy rumble.  I wondered if that is a similar tactic as the casinos with all the noisy slots etc.  like maybe 'eat and split'?  Table was very wobbly too which was a turn off for a 'kind of high end' joint.    Food was good but I thought the fries were supposed to be seasoned(?).   Our two dishes seemed like they had a variety of flavors jammed in there.  This spice, that sauce plus this herb and that garnish.  I dunno. I think I would have better things to say about the food if the environment wasn't dominating the experience.     App and two meals $70. (No drinks for us.). The previous night we chilled at the pizza place down the hall and had great conversation.  I think I enjoyed that more because less expectations.

Atmosphere is relaxed yet meh at the same time.  I would say it's more of a gastropub than a public house.  They have a wide selection of cold beers which is highly welcome.  The bar staff has always been prompt and friendly and does at times become a challenge to find a seat at.  Good spot for drinks.  The one thing they are lacking is a decent happy hour.  Well, they'd have to have one for it to be decent.  The only resemblance of a happy hour is mediocre at best drink specials during games.

It was so hot I almost burnt my tongue. Ha to wait a few mins to let it cool down. So I ate the lump crab balls in the mean time.  The crab balls were OK, more like a crab cake but round like a takoyaki ball. Not sure if it was worth the $17. But this is Vegas and a Signature Chef's restaurant. Finally got to start on the Pie. It was also OK nothing to write home about. I've had a better Pie else where, Costco, for much less. It was so filling I could not finish it myself.   The pastrami looked tempting as well, but it looked more like a Ruben, though technically a Ruben is a Pastrami with sauerkraut and cheese.   Being this was a Robert Irvine Signature restaurant, I was expecting more, but it was somewhat average and over priced, like double. I would have given 5 stars if it met and overcame my expectations. To me it was a somewhat disappointing experience. Average overpriced food gets an average rating.",

I ordered the schnitzel with a side of mushroom gravy.  After dining at Robert Irvine's Public House @ The Tropicana on August 2nd. I got food poisoning. Not just a bad 24 hours. But I was hospitalized. This experience resulted in missing the convention I was there for as well as a concert by Tim McGraw. I was so disappointed cause I was a huge fan of Irvine's and I really expected some kind of response but I guess responding to someone you put in the hospital after eating your food is not too high on their list. I'm so disappointed cause I expected much more from an Irvine restaurant. I contacted both the restaurant and Chef Irvine by email and allowed ample time for a response. I wanted to at least say they contacted me to check on me and make sure I was doing better. Unfortunately that did not happen.  And the reason I can state without a doubt that the food at Irvine's restaurant was the culprit is due to my earlier meal that day was crackers. The heat was merciless and I did not have an appetite so it was early evening when we dined at the restaurant and it was my first meal of the day.  IF I ever go back to Las Vegas, I will NEVER eat at Robert Irvine's Public House and I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone else. I would not want my worst enemy to go through that awful experience. This experience caused my first trip to Vegas to be something I cannot look back on with any fond memories. I missed out on our final day of convention, the Tim McGraw concert (I cannot get any of my money back either!) And having to be pushed through an airport in a wheelchair and use barf bags all the way home. I guess you can understand why I have no fond memories. So eat there at your own risk friends.",

I had an effen cocktail.. forgot the name but it was  deliciousness in a glass.  I ordered the slaw as an appetizer since they had the cajones to put it on the menu. It was best slaw I ever had.. so good I forgot I paid $8 for it. The pizzas are medium size, perfect for 2 ppl. Did not taste like fast food pizza, very simple yet full of flavor. Service was excellent the first time.. update. Second time. Place is dead. Different bartender. Still good place",

I'm staying at the Tropicana and I've been walking by this place multiple times a day, planning for when I could find the time to go.  I went after the comedy show upstairs and arrived at around 9:45pm only to be told that the kitchen was not serving food any longer, when closing was not until 11pm!  Nowhere online does it show that there is a time that food service ends before the time of closing!  I'm just disappointed in their business choices, now I won't have a chance to try the resteraunt.",

Then I ordered shepherd's pie.  It had a double crust and the top one was cooked but the bottom one was raw. So they took it off the bill.  We ordered the dessert that was supposed to be lemon curd, pound cake and meringue crust. The \"meringue\" crust was melty and there was no lemon curd anywhere.  Instead there were strawberries and maybe some sort of raspberry stuff so really sweet and inedible.  Very disappointing.  And so loud! Hard to have a conversation.   The manager took it all off the bill but I would rather have had a great meal and paid.  8-22-19. I am updating this to reflect my recent experience.  The menu has changed, the service was excellent and the wedge salad was amazing.   I would definitely recommend it now that the bugs are worked out!",

We liked the air hockey game.  All of the food was ok but very, very salty.  Why stack the pastrami sandwich? The bread gets very soggy when stacked; wet and mushy bread for each half.  Nachos with cheese-sauce-stuff...very gringo...can't really blame Irvine cuz authentic Mexican wouldn't be expected.   Paid over $100 but couldn't use our \"free\" small appetizer coupon....technically our expensive tenders, fries, sandwich with fries and steak nachos all don't count as an entree to use the coupon. Ugh.   Great waitress!  Food was just ok but too expensive for what we received. We went for convenience and just plain hunger after arriving.  We won't return...ever. :)   Mr Irvine: my suggestion, is to eat at your own restaurant and see if it even meets your own standards. Doubt that that will happen.",

The place was nice and modern. We were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately, shortly after, someone brought us glasses of water, then our water came to take our order. The host and waiter was nice and friendly, suggested item on the menu and answered all our questions.   We ordered The F&K fondue burger, Burnt Ends pork belly, Steak & Frites, Mac & Cheese Carbonara, and the General Tso smoke chicken wings for our free appetizer.   The chicken wings came out pretty fast, however the rest of the food took a while. I would say at least 30 minutes. That would be the only thing I was disappointed about, but I didn't think it was worth taking off a whole star for that.   The food was delicious! The chicken wings was different it was general tso flavored. Th burger was also unique as it had melted cheese all over it, we thought the beef patty was a little salty. The Steak & Frites was cooked perfectly, it was delish, but the MAC & CHEESE carbonara was our favorite!!! It was so creamy and was very very delicious. I can say that I would come back there just for that. That good!!!",

    "text": "Overpriced menu, underwhelming food, and shoddy service -- that sums it up pretty well. I ate dinner her twice on my recent Vegas stay and won't do it again. I'd much rather spend more money at the Tropicana's Oakville Steakhouse and at least get some return on my money. If that's too much, then just hit the Vegas strip for plenty of other reasonably priced options. While the atmosphere here looks appealing, everything else sells you short. During my two visits I tried the ribs and steak salad for entrees, then wedge salad, wings, carbonara mac, and mixed vegetables for sides/apps. While the steak salad was probably the best item I had here -- it was still a average and small for the price. For a restaurant that carries the name of notorious chef, I was specially surprised that they didn't remove the membrane from the under portion of the ribs, which helps them cook and keeps them from carrying a crispy, burnt bottom layer. The ribs felt like they were nuked, far from slow cooked w/ Plain, average BBQ sauce. I would definitely avoid this item -- even though it was recommended by our server. The wings were also very underwhelming for the +$20 price tag, which I scoffed at -- but had to talk myself into on a football Sunday. Honestly the best item from the hot items were the mixed vegetables (in picture), which even included some broccoflower. They were well seasoned and well cooked.  I will also admit the banana banoffe pie floored me and at least sent my away in peace on day 2. The key lime pie was also solid. If I had a sweet tooth, I honest would come in for either of those -- maybe a meal of veggies!! -- but nothing else listed.  I wouldn't roll the dice again on anything new, either.",

Their Asian chicken and Caesar salads are delicious - perfect for a pre or post show meal. If you are really hungry, I recommend trying one of their burgers (they have some signature ones as well as a build your own option) or the ribs.  I personally love the bourbon maple salmon with bacon because it's just enough to leave room for dessert!  What's for dessert? English Banoffee Pie. BANANAS and TOFEE with whipped cream in a pie crust. How can you go wrong?   There are other things on their menu worth trying... nachos, wings, pastrami sandwich, pizzas...   Give it a shot! Be nice to your server and they will be nice to you.   Tip: locals get a discount with an ID and players card!",

That was a no go because they didn't start the RW menu until 5 PM.  I had tried the fish and chips on my first experience here and I opted to try it again.  It was a very curious dish.  The cod was bland as expected but a little malt vinegar helped that along some.  The chips are not British chips.  It tasted like they were covered in mustard.  It turns out the French fries are covered with a curry aioli, feta cheese, and bacon bits.  It seems like a bizarre combination but the fries were a lot better than the fish.  Payoff came with dessert.  The Banoffee pie was quite good.  Smooth and rich, it was a good way to end the meal.  Service was good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and my server was always in the area for a question or to check on how I was doing.    After this meal, I have Irvine's Public House out of my system.

My bf and I sat at the bar to watch one of the Women's World Cup matches and we originally thought it was the Sport's Book which is located next door. What a pleasant surprise. This review is only based on the atmosphere and drinks. We planned to come back for food because everything that came out looked so good, but we never made it. The menu has a bit of everything from salads, burgers, sandwiches and pizza to Shepard's pie and fish & chips.  The cocktail, beer and wine lists are extensive. We started out with a Watermelon Mint Cooler because we were excited by the idea of fresh watermelon accompanied by Boardroom Ginger Vodka, fresh lime and mint. It was fruity and refreshing. Then we couldn't pass up their shot and a beer for $14 deal. You have 6 options and we went with the Robert Irvine: a cold glass of Stella on draft alongside a shot of chilled Patron Silver. Both went down so easily I could have continued drinking these all day.   We had fun playing their free games like giant Connect Four, shuffleboard, and some electronic arcade-type games. There are lots of large tv's and some lounge seat areas. The bartenders although attentive were NOT friendly or fun at all. Additionally, a woman next to us mentioned that the steak she had requested at medium-rare came out well done, and that she wasn't asking to send it back but only wanted to bring it to their attention. The bartender literally did not acknowledge her any of the 3 times she mentioned it but ended up giving her a discount at the end. Some friendlier staff would liven the place up.",

(Hostess placed us in a section that was closing apparently.) anyway, that was a major glitch but the food was worth every moment of that glitch.  When we did \"get\" a server, he was great! (George from Hawaii)  The Ahi Tuna Sashimi was DIVINE.  In fact my friend went back the next day and had that small plate along with the shoestring fries which were ALSO AMAZING.   Seriously, the shoestring fries with the curry aioli and feta were delicious and I'm not even a fan of curry.   The Asian Salad was good but it couldn't be compared to the phenomenal sashimi or shoestring fries.   The ribs were good a little too peppery for my taste but the coleslaw helped cool the palate.   Really there was absolutely no room for dessert but we had to indulge and try the skillet cookie. OMG. Incredible.  The ice cream was the perfect addition to the skillet l; cutting the sweetness of the cookie, making it perfect. And it was HUGE, shareable.   So glad we stopped at Robert Irvine's PH even if it was our last night in Las Vegas. It will be one of our regular stops when we come to town.   You should totally have a meal here!  Updated to 5-star. Manager wrote and addressed the extended wait time. Top notch restaurant. Many don't follow-up! And my friend dined there the next day and re-ordered some of the favorite plates!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Chef Irvine and I have dined here twice. The first visit was good, the second was a disaster. Perhaps a third time will be the real litmus test, but after my most recent visit, I have no intention nor desire to return anytime soon.   The pub atmosphere is really cool, wide open with lots of t.v.s (a great place to pre-game before a VGK hockey game) and a large, central, wraparound bar. It's a fun hangout spot and would be even moreso if the prices weren't so expensive!  You'll find typical sounding pub food here, like cheese fries, wings, and burgers. I say \"typical sounding\" because each one has Irvine's wild chef spin on it. There's nothing boring on the menu here, and every dish is creative and out there -- sometimes to a fault.   Since this restaurant is located on the Strip, it's one that is aimed at tourists. That means high prices. As a Vegas local, I'd love to hang out here and have drinks and bar snacks, but the prices are ridiculous. (Maybe offering a discount or something for locals who would gladly become regulars would be helpful; just a thought).   An extensive craft beer menu will please all beer drinkers.   I've eaten most of the small plates here as well as a burger, and they ranged from decent to gross. The burgers are good, but mine ($22) was served cold and with a stale bun. The menu touted homemade cheese sauce which sounded awesome, until my burger arrived and it was POURED OVER THE TOP OF THE BUN. Gross! I couldn't even eat the thing without a knife and fork.   The chicken wings ($24 / dozen; yeah, you read that correctly) are nasty, not crispy at all, and not even spicy. When I can eat 'em and not even break a sweat, that means the sauce is weak.   The things the kitchen does well are all the dishes with fried potatoes -- tater tots, french fries, all are good. But it's hard not to love fries! The tater tot poutine is my favorite, but it's hard to get over the fact that you're paying $16 for a handful of tots.The menu has changed a bit over the months, so don't get too set on a favorite dish.   I don't hate this place and I want to love it, but it's really difficult to with the mediocrity both in terms of service, the kitchen, and the prices. Expect to drop a minimum of $80 - $100 for two to eat dinner (not even counting drinks)!  I don't mind paying for truly gourmet chef-inspired food, but this place is a huge letdown.",

It was served with a tasty-sounding lemon caper aioli that was a plain mayo. It was better without it.   I got the tater tots (a favorite last time I visited), which are so dang good I could happily get a big bowl of them and nothing else. I don't understand the blue cheese and bacon with it: they're perfect the way they are.  My wife's blackened mahi mahi sandwich was tasty but a bit on the dry side. The achiote aioli was terrific (on her sandwich and mine).   The chicken with my daughter's Caesar salad was juicy and flavorful, and the dressing had just the right touch of anchovy. My son's pizza was one of the better thin crust pizzas I've ever had, with a drizzle of pesto.  I got a beer, my wife got a wine, and it was $158 with a tip for our meal. The service was a bit slow, considering how deserted it was. No complaints about the food, but, wowie wow do you pay for all this!",

    "text": "I surveyed the menu and reviews before my visit and asked friends for recommendations. Don't get your heart set on anything because apparently they change it up frequently. Friends suggested several dishes and not a single one was still available- no french onion fondue, lamb shank, deviled eggs, heirloom tomato and ciabatta salad, etc but they do have a ton of generic sandwiches and pizzas. Go figure. In any case, I took it as a warning and prepared for a dismal dining experience only to enjoy the majority of our dishes!  CHILLED JUMBO SHRIMP SCAMPI TOASTS: Pretty presentation, fresh poached shrimp, interesting combination of flavors and textures with avocado and ricotta, wish there was more lemon sauce. PH SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS: $14/6 piece is a bit steep and these were on the smaller side of average, sauce was decent (mild to me, hot to my friend), served over bread with celery, carrot, and ranch. BURRATA & NEVADA STONE FRUIT: I assume the fruit was white peaches, but this salad was actually a pretty amazing flavor combo with peppery arugula, creamy burrata, and sweet fruit topped with almonds and pepper. PRESSED PROSCIUTTO PIADINI: Mozz and prosciutto is already a match made in heaven, but add pesto and wrap it in soft naan? I'm sold. This was not as good as expected, half-cut presentation is pretty but ingredients slide around and fall out. \"Pesto\" was a basil cream sauce, would have been better with straight pesto. This is served with a mountain of fries, which were unseasoned and on the hard side. STEAK FRITES: Perfect med-rare cook on the steak, topped with a tasty chimmi churri sauce I could have used more of, and served with a generous portion of unseasoned asparagus and more unseasoned, hard fries. The vast majority of our fries went uneaten, but everything else was decent. How does a gastropub do fries so poorly? Whatever, the steak was delish. CARBONARA \"MAC&CHEESE\": Cavatappi pasta served in a cream sauce with peas and bacon. Generous portion, went unfinished not because it wasn't good but because it's so heavy. ENGLISH BANNOFFEE PIE: Chef's specialty, per those who watch his shows. I enjoyed the flavor combo of banana and toffee more than I thought I might, and the espresso ice cream paired well with it. Presentation was nice but chocolate drizzle would be better on top- white plate with a white triangle pie slice is visually boring but the flavors were so good we actually finished the dessert after this massive meal!  Service from Contessa was casual and courteous. Location ambiance is weird, for a build-out it feels like a generic casino cafe with odd western decor accents like leather-wrapped plumbing pipes? The entrance is dramatic and the bar is beautiful, and like that they have a functional shuffleboard table to play while you wait for a table.",

We felt the fish was cooked excellently, the batter was crispy but not too thick, the fish tender and juicy.   The second meal, which I remembered to take pictures of, included their poutine appetizer, which we got for free as we used the coupon included with our room key cards. Tater tot poutine. Very good. Goat cheese really made the dish. The salmon was almost perfect--a tad overcooked. The filet sat atop roasted new potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts need to be blanched prior to roasting as they were quite hard.   Overall everything is well-cooked and tasty. I dropped a star because the dishes are a bit overpriced and the place is noisy, to the point you almost have to yell at each other.",

We started off with Ahi Tuna which was kind of like a poke bowl on light toast. For our entrees, my husband had the ribs and I had the salmon. The salmon was out of this world-not fishy at all and full of flavor. My husband really enjoyed the ribs and let me eat some of the Mac and cheese that came on the side which we really enjoyed as well.

I found myself stuck at the Tropicana for a business event and didn't want to travel anywhere else with traffic and my unwillingness to support MGM properties after they sued victims of a dreadful mass shooting.   My personal experience in Irvine'sTropicana Las Vegas restaurant was disappointing and sad.   The service I experienced was beyond terrible.  I was basically forgotten.  When I asked for the check the waiter asked if I wanted a refill, yeah maybe 15 minutes ago, a little late now pal (they did try to make good offering a take away).  I ordered the steak frites and was shocked to find the plate broken into three portions for presentation. Generous portions of fries and an abundance of asparagus but this tiny tiny little piece of meat for steak.   Nothing tasted good because it was dominated by this oil or dressing that the asparagus sits in.  So fries were soggy and asparagus was drenched. I wonder if you request them to plate them separately if they'd oblige?  The atmosphere was pleasant and it was dominated by a host for a rodeo watch party which made for interesting people watching.   Steak, soda and tip ran about $60.  Not ideal by any means.  Especially with the lack of service provided.  Saddened from the experience, I will not return.",

George and the gentleman that cleared my table were top notch. I had the Steak Frites, Honey roasted carrots, the bread pudding, and one of their specialty drinks, the Limey Bastard.   The Steak Frites was very good and I loved their chimichurri over mine. It went well with the steak and it was just delicious. The fries were a bit tuff, but, I did not care, I dipped them into the meat drippings and it was phenomenal.   The Honey roasted carrots were the star of the meal. I just cannot believe how tasty they were. I look forward to practicing this dish at home, as it will make Christmas extra awesome at mom's. Very tasty!  The bread pudding was so amazing and so tasty. I almost wanted to get seconds, but, I had to play it cool in public.   They have a selection of specialty drinks and I normally pass. But, I got the Limey Bastard because I like pineapple. Well, it was very good, but, you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. I ordered a beer as I am not into sweet drinks.   I had a great time and I cannot wait for family to visit so I can bring them here. If you're staying at the Tropicana, you're in for a treat.",

So our night started with one of their signature cocktails not available because they couldn't get the proper ingredients. My wife ordered the yellow heirloom tomato gazpacho as an appetizer. She took a couple of sips and described it as tasteless with chunks of ice in it. I had the French onion fondue which I can best describe as a bowl of melted Velveeta and toast. So far we are pretty disappointed but hoping the two signature dishes we ordered would make up for it. My wife had the Stone fried shepherds pie and I had the F&K fondue burger, medium. Well again, the shepherds pie was so tasteless she had to add the Camembert cheese for my burger to give it any taste at all. My burger was ok, over done and a bit dry. Overall a very disappointing evening but to be fair the waiter took the gazpacho off the bill. About the only positive of the evening.",

The bartender did not appear happy that we were there to place a food order but we let that go and ordered a mushroom pizza with arugula and a hamburger cooked medium well and fries.  The bartender REPEATED THE ORDER TO US so I know he got it right.  We waited about 15 minutes and a young lady from the kitchen brought an order that was not ours.  About 7 minutes later she came back out with another order but there was some obvious confusion because our order had been combined with two additional to go orders. The bartender and the girl from the kitchen took the individual food boxes out of the bag and ACTUALLY OPENED OUR FOOD UP AND SHOOK IT AROUND TO SEE WHAT ALL WAS IN THE BOX!!!!!   No, really, he did just that and then tried to put the box back together, put it in the bag, and handed it to us like everything was ok!  Like it was ok to open up the boxes with our dinner, shake it around so he could see what was in the box.  DID HE HAVE GLOVES ON FOR THIS?  that would be a NEGATIVE, Ghost Rider!   I sat there with my mouth hanging open.  By now my husband had picked up the bag and started to walk off (yep, he was mad and hungry now) and I said to the bartender (name is Nicholas C. on the receipt) \"I can't believe you did that!  That was so wrong!\"  He said he didn't do anything wrong. I said \"you handled his food and then closed it up like that is ok and it is NOT ok!\"  I caught up with my husband and we went straight to the room. We opened up our food.  The French fries were stone cold and the burger was not only cold but was dark pink on the inside (it was cut in half at the restaurant so they knew how it was cooked and also KNEW HOW IT WAS ORDERED (remember, he repeated the order to us).  The pizza was ok but very small.  Ready for this???  This cost us $47!!!!   FYI, Tropicana made good on this fiasco and comped the bill.  Hats off to you, Tropicana, for making it right.",

    "text": "My wife and I are Las Vegas residents and had show tickets at the Tropicana , and decided to try Robert Irvine's Public House a try. The restaurant itself is very nice. The service we had was great. Where they fell short was the food. I had the chicken wing appetizer. The wings were all different sizes. Some drumettes were much larger than others on the plate, and the smaller drumettes along with some very small wingettes were stacked under the larger pieces. Because of the size difference the  smaller pieces were over cooked, dry and tough while the larger pieces were fine. I had the fish and chips. When the plate came out it had a slight off odor. The fish was heavily battered which was bland, and the fish had a mushy texture, and had a unpleasant after taste. The fries were shoestring fries covered in a curry aioli. I'm a curry fan, but not a fan of this aioli. As a result I didn't eat my fish and only had a couple of the fries before I pushed the plate away. My wife had the shepherds pie which was good, although there are two shepherds pies listed on the menu for the same price, one explaining the ingredients of a traditional pie,and the other only stating \" chefs preparation \" which is confusing, but our server explained it was a vegetarian shepherds pie. Our server was great and he discounted our ticket, and offered a discount on our next visit.  With the number of dining options in this town whether it be a celebrity chef or not, you only have one chance to impress, and Robert Irvine fell short.",

I had the lobster roll, which was excellent and the mason jar apple pie was awesome. However, their slogan, Comfort Food, Comfort Everything, does not apply to their chairs.  The backs are awkwardly far back and we are tall.  I would suggest they buy comfy colorful pillows for the chair backs, which would then add comfort to the seating and the experience.  I would try it again, but it did not wow us as we hoped it would.",

    "text": "Decided to try this restaurant because of the Chef and his TV shows which created an expectation level - we were disappointed. While new restaurants generally have some kinks to work out, this Chef's TV shows indicate a high regard for precision, quality and industry expertise which should get the show started much faster; but it did not. Interesting menu choices overall with something for everyone in a group or those looking for a wide array of options; from finger food and sandwiches to a massive steak! Overall, the atmosphere is bland which brings me to our actual meal... we got the poutin app. which was flavorful but was not at all hot and was very skimpy on the gravy... got the bechamel burger which is really messy and hard to eat but the burger had no seasoning on the meat... got the BLT to and the bacon was overlooked and the sandwich is a bit skimpy.. last meal was the fish and chips.. more like a plate of fries and a piece of very bland cod; no flavor at all in the fish or the batter and no offer of any condiments! Skinny fries are a horrible choice for the meals and again no condiments were ever offered.. let alone put in the plate... specialty drinks were good and met expectations.. prices are reasonable for Vegas... given the choices in Vegas Chef Irvine gets my vote for one and done.",

    "text": "My husband was excited to try Public House, so I made reservations for Saturday night. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were told they were overbooked and short seaters, so we would have to wait a while. They had a party of 70, one of 40 and a third of 24. I was not optimistic. But we were seated only a little late. When we ordered our drinks our server said the bar was backed up and we'd really appreciate our drinks once we finally got them, but it wasn't too long of a wait either. The appetizer, the French onion fondue, was pretty good, but bland. The food came out fairly quickly, which was unexpected, but it was just ok. I ordered the fish and chips. The piece of fish was huge, but it wasn't served with any type of sauce , and was too dry. The chips were of course fries, but they had mustard and various other things on them, which was not in the menu description or I would not have ordered them. For me, it made them unappetizing. I am sure that many people would like them. Hubby got the F&K burger, ordered it medium, got it med rare. He said it was ok. At least he had regular fries. Bottom line is, it wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was average. We were hoping for more, and in Vegas, with so many good to great choices, average won't cut it, at least not for us.",

Sat at the bar and was promptly greeted with drink and food menu. Nice selection of beers on tap. Ordered Dogfish head 60 minute IPA. I wanted to try one of Robert's signature items which included wings, fish and chips and a special burger. Went with the wings which came out quickly. Nice presentation of perfectly cooked wings with a little zip. Pretty sure sauce was made with Frank's hot sauce which I like. In addition, all of the other food coming out around me looked good with nice sized portions. Unfortunately too full to try additional food items. Prices are a bit speedy but in line with similar places on the strip.",

I waited about 10 days till we visited with a big group, celebrating my uncles 70th birthday.   I am reading these other reviews and just don't think they were at the same restaurant I was because its so far from out experience.  The hostess was not at the podium when we arrived, but she was busy with another guest. We were seated in about 2 minutes.  The seating by the window does have traffic beneath it but lots of signs and people watching, it you take the chair facing the west you can see the strip.  There is more than one chair at the table.  The waitress came over after about five minutes, but we were still figuring out where everyone was sitting so we probably did not look settled.  The beer selection is amazing.  My family wanted to take it home and frame it.  The food is off the chart.  We did every appetizer and the beef tartare dissolved in about 2 minutes we had to order another one for the table.  The skirt steak was to die for but I think and we all agreed the signature dish that will keep people coming back is the shepherds pie with lamb.  We had to managers come by and ask how out food was tasting, we got plenty of attention but did not get smothered.  I was not expecting it to be this good,  Honestly , it just opened, however they hit the mark at every step.  Congrats...you have a winner here.",

    "text": "I've never written a bad review of a restaurant before, we are staying at the Trop and are Hilton Diamond members. We went to have a quick burger here at 4:45 as I've had a few beers here in the past without eating and thought we'd try the food, we were told by the hostess that the whole place was reserved and if we wanted anything we would have to sit at the bar and use a very limited bar menu.  There  were only six people at one table in the entire place and a pretty full bar. Never once were we told that the full menu wasn't served until 5 and we could wait. So, we went over to the Tap at the MGM and ate there, the burger was amazing and the staff were great I highly recommend the Tap at the MGM. Back to the Public House we went back about an hour and a half later and the restaurant was still empty, I asked for the manager and told him what happened. He danced around with \"well, some of those tables are reserved and people come and go\" I pointed out that they were just as empty as they were an hour ago and that his hostess was an idiot for not finding a place for a paying customer.      The manager then started yelling that I better not call her names. (she wasn't there and I was referring to her lack of customer service and actions) he then told us to leave. I doubt if I would ever return and this possibly includes staying at the Trop. I owned a place rather like this and would never let a customer leave unhappy.  Forget the Public House and go across the street to the Tap at MGM instead.",

This place has an interesting menu, but at 1 pm it doesn't seem it should be out of the bread it advertises for one of its sandwiches. I made the mistake of ordering it with a poor substitute and the meal suffered. Given the lack of business on the weekend we dined, I suspect poor supply management isn't the only problem. Perhaps we'll see Robert fix his own restaurant on one of his future shows?",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Restaurant  Impossible so when in Vegas with friends staying nearby at MGM we had to try Public House.  Unfortunately this place is the type of place that you normally see on Restaurant Impossible.  Robert Irvine would be embarrassed that this place has his name on it. From food to service it was a mess. It is a nice place inside, just the food and service are poor.   For three couples we started with the French Onion fondue.  It was like a thick onion soup served with bread. The fondue itself was very good however it was served with 6 small slices of under toasted bread.  The amount of bread was small compared to the amount of fondue so we asked for more bread. They charged us $5 for 6 small circles of bread.   On to the entrees.  Grilled chicken sandwich with watercress,avocado, brie and fig marmalade was overly sweet and missing chicken on one half of the sandwich.  I showed the waiter and he asked what I wanted him to do .I again showed him that half was missing chicken. He said he would bring a piece of grilled chicken. He comes back 10 minutes later to tell me that the chef says it will be about 20 minutes to get another piece of chicken for the sandwich.  Really ?  Instead of waiting since we had a show to catch we were offered a free dessert.  I would have like the chicken sandwich that I ordered.   Shoestring fries served with the sandwich were an obviously frozen product, barely warm, no seasoning. Robert Irvine would taste one on his show, say \"garbage\" and throw the fries. Complete failure.   Margarita pizza.  Arrives with warm edges but cold center and bottom. Obviously another frozen product. It was like eating a frozen supermarket pizza.   Salad of roasted vegetables was a pile of mush. I dont even know how they sent this out of the kitchen.   BLT wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. Think of the BLT that you make yourself at home. Nothing special, just OK.   Overall this place was a mess. Waiter was nice but had no clue how to deal with a customer who receives poor quality food.  I do hope Robert Irvines reputation doesnt take a hit because of this place. It really is like a place that he goes in to fix on Restaurant Impossible.    If you want a good meal avoid it.",

The hostess sat my husband and I at a small table close to the bar. I asked if she had a table in a section that wasn't so noisy and she said the noise level was the same throughout the restaurant, she didn't even try to accommodate my request. We had a delightful male server, I ordered lamb croquettes as an appetizer ( something I was eager to try) only to be told 10 minutes later that the restaurant was out of lamb croquettes. I was very disappointed, so we ordered a fondue. The fondue had a nice taste if you love onions. Our first round of cocktails weren't so pleasing. It tasted as if there wasn't any alcohol in it, the second round tasted a little better. I ordered the lamb shank, it was very bland, and the mashed potatoes weren't any better tasting. My husband ordered a skirt steak with frites, my husband was pleased with his steak. We ordered dessert, first choice was cheesecake, only to be told that the restaurant isn't serving cheesecake that the chef is revising the recipe. We each ordered a dessert, my husband and I were both dissatisfied with our desserts. My husband and I have been to many of the celebrity chefs restaurants, this is the first time that I have been dissatisfied. I am giving 3 stars because my husband enjoyed his steak and our server tried to be accommodating and the restaurant was very clean and the decor was very warm and inviting. However this is not a restaurant that I would choose to have dinner again.",

The restaurant opened just a few weeks ago and I was lured by a promise of a free appetizer w/ entree purchase for hotel guests.  The decor is casual but very stylish and it's clear there was a lot of attention to detail when deigning this place.  I sat at the bar since I was eating alone and was served by multiple bar staff who were all very friendly and attentive.  I took FOREVER to browse the menu because literally everything sounded delicious.  I settled on the Gazpacho appetizer, Fish and Chips, and a glass of white wine.  The Gazpacho was incredible, and I don't even like tomatoes!  It had lots of flavor and came with a little scoop of pineapple sorbet floating in the bowl.  The fish and chips was also delicious, but had a twist: the fries had a curry aioli, feta cheese, green onions and bacon on top.  Sounds like a weird combo but it worked!  The bar also had a large selection of draft beers and a huge selection of bottled craft beer, which was neatly displayed in glass-front refrigerators below the bar...almost like an extra work of art!  I highly recommend this restaurant, and will definitely eat here again on my next trip to Las Vegas so I can try another of the menu items!",

His fish and chips, we avoided, too non traditional, we figured it was due to Ramsay's chippy place. We opted for the Fondue Burger and Poutine. Both were really good. We liked it enough to plan another visit to try the Sheperd's Pie and Chicken Sandwich. The service was friendly and efficient, however our server pushed the Tequila a bit much, we get that it's special, but we said we were not Tequila drinkers and he should have let it go. He also mention they have already removed items and will be adding new ones to the menu, glad to know they will be changing it up to keep it fresh. Definitely Recommend.",

My husband got the steak Guinness pie. He said it wasn't bad but not worth the $26 that was charged. We have loved watching Robert Irvine's restaurant impossible show. However, after eating here, I feel that he needs to come in and rescue his own restaurant. If Robert Irvine is going to put his name on this restaurant, he needs to come in and see what's going on. There was nothing prompt about the service,and I had to wait over 10 minutes to get my water refilled. For a gourmet chef like him, I would think he would want better for his name.

It was okay - not any fault of the restaurant, just did not like the combo of fries, gravy and cheese curds.  Then came mussels and fries. Having had the dish many times in France and Belgium, we were looking forward to it, but we were seriously disappointed. The fries were not served separately, but under the mussels, soggy, in the mussel broth. Also, the mussels smelled bad. We NEVER send things back in restaurants, but we could not eat them. The waiter was very nice and took them back to the cook, who said \"Sometimes they just smell like that\". But they took them off our bill. So, some good, some bad.",

It was his billboard staring at me from outside the MGM that made me go to the Tropicana for his restaurant-- huge fan.  When you watch him weekly on the show you expect to see the same type of quick, organized, and attentive service that he drills into all of his subjects, however, that wasn't the case.  So what I will say good about it is that the watermelon cooler was delicious with the dehydrated lime bite.  The menu is NOT for anybody watching their weight!!!  The Public Puntain was good if shared, but so heavy it made me want to go night night when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Went here 4 nights ago. We were seated after 2minutes of waiting just standing there with the host. She couldn't take us because she said the other host had to seat us which was fine but weird because this place was dead. it was around 9:30pm btw. We get seated and then have to wait almost 10 minutes for the waitress to come and greet us. which is again weird because we were only like the 5th table in the restaurant. The waitress was nice but with no personality whatsoever, barely even spoke. We ordered our beers and then had the signature buffalo wings as an appetizer. They had a different taste to it and not in a good way. Whatever seasoning they used, they over did it. We didn't finish them as it felt like our mouth was full of way to much sodium already. Then we order our entrees, and when I ask for the tomahawk ribeye, the waitress just said we don't have it. again no reason why, no apology, no personality. Its the 4night of the grand opening how do they not have a robert irvine signature plate. Anyway, I ended up getting the skirt steak and asked for it medium well. The plate comes out maybe 10 minutes later, not too bad, but the fries are hard, cold, stale. And the steak is barely warm as well. And its probably because as you can see in the pic, it is not medium well. it is red and barely cooked. Its edible and it has a plain taste to it and I'm starving so whatever. We then have the signature dessert which is something with banana and espresso. Nothing special, i didn't even care to finish half of it. The atmosphere in the restaurant not nice either, its so loud even when there is no other customers. It makes u feel like you are still out there at the slot machines gambling. I noticed they had a view so I go and take a look at it. It was a very poorly designed restaurant. don't sit by the view because you will be staring at the bus stop and the parking lot. Not nice. Wouldn't come back, would not recommend. The beer was the only good thing here. Waste of time and money, as it is not cheap.",

    "text": "The four of us came twice the first opening week. I see that some reviewers had issues with service. We had excellent service both times. The servers were knowledgeable about the food and gave great recommendations. We shared everything family style.  Shepherd's Pie: DH said it was the best he ever had. I on the other hand did not like it at all because of the gaminess of the lamb. I am also not a fan of the gaminess of goat cheese which is used a lot throughout the menu.  Chicken Wings: Solid. They are very good buffalo style wings but nothing special that stands out among other solid buffalo style wings. Overpriced. Poutine: Everyone in my party loved it. I thought it was too salty. Shoestring Fries: Everyone enjoyed this. Loved how thin, hot, and crispy the fries were. The curry mayo aioli is delicious. Mixed heirloom tomato salad and Spring Green Salad: Liked both salads. I would definitely get the mixed heirloom again. If you like tomatoes this is the one to get. Wild mushroom pizza: It was good, and the goat cheese was not overwhelming. But I probably would not order again. Skirt steak: Ordered it medium. It was okay. The chimichurri was  good. I was little underwhelmed by it. Fish and Chips: First time we went, they were sold out and was waiting for their shipment of fish. We got it on our second visit. The fish was perfectly cooked. It was moist and tasted fresh. Was missing the tartar sauce but I could understand why he wanted the taste of the fish to shine through. Ponzu Glazed Salmon: Again, another solid dish. perfectly cooked, but not wowed by it.  In summary, the food was solid. The chef did a good job with execution. But I wasn't wowed by the food from a personal preference standpoint. I would probably give it more a 3.5 stars only because I expect more from a celebrity chef, las vegas, and its price point.",

The decor and atmosphere was very nice as expected...however we were initially seated at a table that was so wobbly our drinks were at risk for meeting the floor! After being moved to another table we enjoyed a decent draft and bottle beer selection. The onion cheese fondue appetizer was the best thing we ordered. Delicious! I had fish and chips that was crying for some seasoning, it was completely free of even a single grain of salt! It was seriously bland, but on a positive note it was not greasy. My husband had the famous F&K burger that was good but not phenomenal. Definitely better burgers and fish/chips elsewhere. We were not inspired to try dessert. Overall it was not bad, but it was not as good as expected for the caliber of Robert Irvine.",

The restaurant was fairly quiet for being located by the casino. I ordered a burger with French Fries. My food came about 15 minutes later.   My burger was big. It was cooked well and good, but it wasn't worth telling my friends about. Fries were thin which wasn't really my favorite.   I thought my credit would cover this food, but I guess it wasn't part of Tropicana.  I should've confirmed before I ordered because I would have chosen another restaurant if I knew that.  The service was slow even though it wasn't busy. The price was okay.  My overall experience was just okay. I will not come back here.",

The \"pint\" glasses for beer are only 12 ounces, not a 16 ounce pint. The  Shepherds Pie that was ordered was  large at twenty two dollars which is certainly overpriced considering the ratio of mashed potatoes to meat was probably 80/20 or even 90/10. Very disappointing. The large bar is good for watching the bartenders craft the drinks and the open kitchen adds to the large space. Noise level is tolerable.  I would return to the bar to hang out before a show just for the beer choices alone. Robert.. are you reading this?",

I was expecting cheese curds but this was made with wild mushrooms, tater tots, roast beef, and goat cheese. The sauce/gravy was heavenly and we jokingly thought maybe we will just eat this and be happy. The fish were large, fresh and full of flavor but the chips, that's where the magic happened. There was a malt, curry aoli with bacon and feta cheese tossed into the chips. Holy moly, so good! Pizza was good, full of flavor with a delicious crust. We cannot wait to go back and try more items on the menu. We even bought shot glasses!",

    "text": "Disappointing for sure.  When we arrived there was nobody to seat us however the couple waiting in front of us mentioned a staff member had said they'd \"be right over\" but that was several minutes before. Hubby and I waited a few minutes and when no hostess appeared we went and found our friends in the restaurant who had already been seated. Not sure how long the poor other couple waited.  This place was not busy and our waitress was horrible. My soda wasn't refilled and she never checked on us, she was sooooo slow, and we had to waive her down after we'd been done eating over 20 mins to get a bill. Very distressing was that I asked if we could use player club reward points and she said yes. She took my card, never asked for id or me to sign anything and used $100 worth of points. Never at any casino have I not had my id checked against my card.  The food was meh and lower meh at that for the price. And, for a place that wasn't busy, it took an unusually long time to come out.  My friend's steak was greasy and swimming in chimichurri, they were out of the chicken sandwich I wanted to order yet I don't know why because they seemed to have all the components, my husband's chicken sandwich was fine and everything food wise was really unremarkable.  I liked the atmosphere and the free parking. One star for each lol",

At $18 you're still making plenty of money.   They didn't have my first two draft choices of beer, which is never a good sign. And overall it was a good, but not memorable meal. Actually paying $150 for a burger, chicken sandwich and wings plus a few beers",

When you get rid of your most complimented upon dish, it's written in the stars...  I've been here a few times. The Fondue is absolutely spectacular! Otherwise, everything else is good, but not rock your world good. I would have given it 4 stars because the service is great, the location is great, and it offers something above and beyond the normal mediocre offerings in the Tropicana.  However. I dinged them a star due to the pizza. My last visit in November, I ordered a cheese pizza to go. It says it has arugula/rocket on it, which is my favorite flavor on a pizza. But it didn't say and I never presumed they'd bake the pizza with the arugula on it!!! You NEVER do that! Please! It basically alters  the flavor profile of the arugula from beautifully bitter to murky and dirty bitter. The texture of the baked arugula was like seaweed. I love bitter flavors but this is a disaster. If this is indeed how it's supposed to be, wow. It should be added after the baking.",

We were a party of 6, and our table had a nice view. Our servers was a woman in a patriots jersey, I can't remember her exact name. She recommended the public house poutine and I was skeptical because I'm not a huge mushroom fan but we tried it out. I'm the only person who didn't care for it at the table, everyone else thought it was just ok.. it really needed more goat cheese. I ordered the steak frites which was tasty, nice slightly spicy chimichurri but my fries were cold and they were swapped out almost immediately which was nice. My friend ordered the Sheppard's pie and sent it back because it had zero flavor, ordered the liver and onions which was deep fried and crispy but tasted like nothing but thyme. My mom enjoyed her beet salad salad, my girlfriend didn't enjoy her margarita pizza at all but the fish and chips were pretty good.. the s'mores dip and banoffee pie was good.. My cocktail the caprioska (sp!) was super tart, made with Robert Irvine's house made spirits, I was told that's normal for caprioskas to be tart, so I just went with it.   Our server was present but not super attentive.. not sure if we will be back.. Will not recommend to friends who visit",

The chicken dish my cohort ate was said to be sub par, he stated he'd rather have Popeyes! lol The more expensive Poutine had little taste appeal, the pulled pork had no smoke flavor, dry, and there was no gravy to speak of, nothing like what you'd receive in Canada.  The service was good, and the Buffalo style Chicken Wings were very very tasty. Would definitely go back for the wings and drinks only!",

    "text": "Have to say, disappointment at the highest level. My husband and I came here for dinner before a comedy show as it looked clean and with a celebrity chef as the namesake, how much could go wrong? Answer: everything.  When we walked in, there was no host/ess in sight. We stood there momentarily while several servers and bartenders looked at us blankly but said nothing. We walked halfway into the restaurant to find someone and finally came across the hostess. She got us seated and all was fine. Ordered our drinks and weren't planning on ordering an appetizer, but the server suggested the artichoke hummus. I wish he hadn't. Sometimes I understand making interesting changes to a standard dish, but not here. The whole thing was sour, and tasted old. The bread was hard and overall the plate was unappetizing.  I ordered a chicken milanese sandwich and my husband ordered a steak pie. My chicken was hard and dry, I actually just had to take it off of the bread and cut it into smaller pieces to eat.  My husbands pie looked great from the outside, but on the inside was a mushed up mess of chewy steak that tasted as if it was microwaved. He ate the crust with the sauce because that was all he could eat.  We asked for a refill about halfway through from the woman who brought out our food but she said she'd bring over our server so we could ask him...can't you just let him know we need refills? Service level is bad.   I don't mind paying premium for good food, we live here, we know how it is. This place wasn't worth half of what they were charging for it. I wonder how Robert Irvine would react to this place if it ended up on his show.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I live in Vegas and when new places come we like to go and try it before we recommend places to guest/tourists. Myself and 4 family members went to sample this place on the first of October we made reservations for 6:15. When we got to the restaurant we had about 5 mins before the time the reservation was for so I was fine when she told us it would be a few until it was ready. When we finally were seated it took 30min before our waitress arrived once again I can understand it's a newer place and it's a little busy apps come out and they are decent then another 30 mins until we see our waitress again we order dinner I think the waitress was trying to up-sell the menu so when my mother ordered the fish and chips it sounded like the dish did not come with chips and she needed to order appetizer course that had toppings on it so we state it's ok we are a little confused cause and were thinking why would it say fish and chips but only be fish when the orders arrive 2 are cold at this point my brother in law was pissed and went to get a manager. He was a great guy really understanding we he sent the 2 meals back to be remade so on the service side it was a long wait.  Food wise READ THE MENU CAREFULLY ask questions they have a peanut butter beer that is amazing and the custom poutine has great flavor The knock out was not good at all it tasted of nasty hot dog water and raw veggies the fish was great and does come with fries so you DONT have to order the appetizer but unfortunately we can't bring ourselves to recommend this location to tourists just yet we will have to go and try it again in about a year to see if they work out the kinks.",

I have been here 3 times,  (my meals are comped),  here is my experience.  The skirt steak in my opinion is good (I've had this twice here), however it is overpriced. It is the same skirt steak that used to be served in the Cafe, (the cafe has been replaced by the buffet).  It is the same steak believe me, I have ordered it from the Cafe several times! Same flavor, same fries; the only difference is this one has chimichuri sauce and of course a much higher price, it is $11 more.  People this is Cafe skirt steak with Robert Irvine's name on it!  My spouse had the fish and chips, I had a taste...again in my opinion the fish was not bad, not too greasy.  Here's the problem, you only got 1 piece of fish, that was about $25, it is not worth it.  You can go across the street (MGM or New York New York or even Hooters) and get fish and chips for half the price.    On another occasion we left when we came in to see this limited menu and was told it's open seating, only to then be directed to the bar. If I wanted to eat at the bar I would go to the bar.    On another occasion we left when we were told we could not bring any \"outside\" drinks inside the restaurant, when I say outside I am talking about from the casino. We gladly took our drinks and generous tip money to the Biscayne Steak House.  I tend to not let one incident judge my overall experience.  We can all have a bad day.  But I've had enough now.  I feel I can write this review honestly and fairly.  For all of the hype, grand opening parties, million dollar renovation, full size picture on the building, etc. you would expect more.  Tropicana is getting a Chinese and a Mexican take out restaurant soon.  I would suggest to tourist to spend your dining dollars elsewhere.",

Everything we had to eat was excellent, from the pouting, to the steak, pizza, mac and cheese, salmon and pastrami sandwich.  I must add in the delicious peach cheesecake and bread pudding.  Omg yum! I can't wait to fly back to Las Vegas to visit again.  I'm so happy for Robert and his family. He made a point of telling everyone at his grand opening that he will have a residency there, so he should be watching over carefully.  I love that this celebrity chef is so hands on!",

    "text": "I was Robert Irvine's fan, and this was my first time visiting his restaurant.  Unfortunately the food here was disappointing.  Most of the food I ordered today was just not spot on and just ok.   I started with a glass of watermelon cooler as the drink since the waiter highly recommended it.  But it tasted just like watermelon juice heavily diluted by vodka.  The waiter said it would be very refreshing, and I would be able to find watermelon pieces inside.  Unfortunately I didn't get it.  And I also found that it was charged as $13 instead of $12 according to the menu.  Not a big difference, but I am wondering how many times they have charged customers with the wrong price.  My appetizer was crab & prosciutto arancini.  To be honest, I've never had arancini before, but I can tell some thing was not right.  The crab and prosciutto tasted good together, and the cheese did not overpower them.  But the cheese was not melt down thoroughly, so it tastes like chewed bubblegum.  And the size of those arancini varied a lot, and the sauce added one more creamy element on top of the creamy inside of arancini.  I would say it lacks of contrast here and make it tastes too heavy.  Duck confit was my entree.  It was an option of buttermilk fried chicken, but I didn't expect the duck confit would come with a fried breaded skin.  I somehow feel it works, since they nailed the tender duck confit and added a crispy skin to it, but the crispy skin somehow lacked the crunchiness.  Maybe it was because of the breading.  And the sauce underneath the duck was super sour that I felt the chef spilled a whole bottle of vinegar into it.  Personally I don't think the sauce went well with the duck or the vegetables aside.  Once the vegetables were soaked in the sauce, they tasted like pickles.  Maybe that was the idea, but I unfortunately cannot appreciate it.",

James the bartender was new to the restaurant but was excellent in his people skills. We started with the buffalo wings which were a nice blend of flavor but not to the point of overpowering. We also had the crab balls which were ok in themselves but with the sauces were pretty good. For the main course, We had the Shepard pie and the duck confit. The Shepard s pie lacked character it was neither good not bad. Just blah. But my meal was the duck. It was a great balance of acidity on the kale, the duck fatty meat and the crisp of the skin. A high recommend. For desert we tried the chocolate mouse and then the apple pie. The mousse lacked character but had good crunch on the crumble on it. The apple pie was pretty good and a little novel being served in a jar. Cost added up to what is comparable with some of the more upscale restaurants in the area but with the service, i would put it on par with them.",

It was definitely a out of body experience and pleasure! The Grand Opening of Robert Irvine Public House at Tropicana Las Vegas was absolutely superb!!! For starters I tried the Heirloom Ciabatta Salad. This salad bursts of delicious flavors from the dressing to the crisp Ciabatta Bread topped with plenty of tomatoes! My husband has such a distaste for tomatoes but his tastebuds definitely were compromised with this starter dish! Next we tried the Wings which were to die for.  They had little spice to us because we are die hard spicy food eaters but to other in our group they seemed to have a little trouble handling them and they were served with a creamy blue cheese dressing. Also what I found unique was that these wings were cooked in Moonshine and the taste was like no other they are definitely a must try!! We also had the the fries that were topped with bacon and feta cheese...I LOVE FETA!! These fries had an interesting taste if you love loaded fries this is a good try...its not for everyone because of the unique cheese used.   Don't get full on me just yet we have much more to rave and rant about! Next we had the Steak and Asparagus and OMG I love my meats but the crisp and fresh seasoned asparagus was close to the best in my book. My husband said the Steak was hands down his favorite so its safe to say that one should not be ordered without the other! We tried the Caramelized Onion and Prosciutto Pizza Mmm Mmm Good! Ok so for the last dish that is not in the desert realm my favorite for today's eats was the Marble Rye Bread Pastrami Sandwich...that alone would have gained a 5 Star rating from me!   Ok so now let's get down to the sweet business...we tried the banana wafer pie with ice cream, the cheesecake served with peaches, the almond pie served with a plum topping and all 3 were MAGNIFICENT!!!   Now that we are all drooling from these delish descriptions of Excellence let's take a glance at the staff. The staff was great! Our servers were so attentive it wasn't a moment where we needed to call on them for anything they addressed us with what we needed without us asking! Over all this place is a definite GO to and REFER to for anyone in the city of Las Vegas!   Thank You Chef Irvine and Staff for the excellent experience and Congrats!!! I'm definitely looking forward to trying new things during my next visit !!!  *Please Note* We did not have a menu for these dishes so the descriptions may not be the exact name of the dishes.",

Well I have no doubt now, the new restaurant at the Tropicana has great food, friendly wait staff and pretty reasonable price.  Our waiter Jovanny's menu knowledge guided us to the best dishes.  Lisa the runner made sure everything was to our liking and that we were happy with our meal. I was very impressed and can't wait to return.",

    "text": "This was an overall wonderful experience. From beginning to end, everything was spectacular, including the staff and Chef Irvine himself. Our table of four made a reservation through Yelp, which was very convenient.   To begin the night, we had Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings and Poutine. The Chicken wings were juicy and were covered with a heaping amount of sauce, which was delicious. It had a spicy kick to it, but it was not too spicy where it overpowered the smokey flavor in the wings. The poutine, unlike the traditional version, used crisp tater tots as the base. Surprisingly, the tots were able to stay crunchy from the first piece to the last bite! The pulled pork was also very tender and flavorful on its own, giving the poutine an extra dimension of flavor. The peppered goat cheese also gave a light, creaminess to the dish.  For the main course, our table shared the Tomahawk Ribeye Chop. This is a 40 oz Creekstone ribeye chop, that is served with a side of fingerling potatoes. The steak was cooked to a beautiful medium rare, allowing it to be tender enough to cut through with a butter knife. The steak on its own was very delicious, but it was accompanied by a lemon truffle vinaigrette than enhanced the natural flavors of the beef. The fingerling potatoes were amazing, to say the least. They had a crisp skin and a light, airy middle. They were seasoned to perfection; I probably ate 40% of the table's potatoes! On this day, we also received an extra side of seasonal vegetables to accompany our meal, which contained carrots, broccolini, baby squash, and asparagus that were lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.   To end the night, we had the English Banoffee Pie and the Warm Bread Pudding. The Pie was a recommendation, and it was the wonderful marriage of an elegant banana cream pie and ooey gooey toffee, without the extra sweetness that you can get from either of the desserts by themselves. It was accompanied by an espresso ice cream. But the real table pleaser was the bread pudding; the bread was warm and soft and not that sweet at all, but the tartness from the rhubarb chutney and the slight sweetness from the strawberry anglaise sauce made this dish absolutely amazing. The two flavors offset each other to give a perfectly harmonized dish. The almond brittle that topped it, though may look like a decoration, also gave an extra crunch the dessert needed that was also very good.   The entire experience was amazing. The food was amazing, and Chef Irvine checked by our table about 3 times to make sure we enjoyed our meal and to get our feedback on everything. Definitely will be taking my friends and family who visit Vegas here!",

    "text": "As a complete fan of Chef Irvine we HAD to have a meal at Public House on our trip to Las Vegas.    The restaurant is beautiful and very comfortable.  As a fan of \"Restaurant Impossible\", we expected it to be as wonderful as it was.    Despite not being too busy, our service started a little slow.  The server, while being friendly was a little distracted early in our meal.  It took quite a while to get drinks and then to order.  On a good note, she did rebound strong.  She became very attentive and even went above and beyond when one of our party didn't realize the mustard would be on the Pastramj and not on the side.  She ran back to the kitchen and had them redo the top of the sandwich.   Excellent service and that fully redeems the slow start.    Two of us had the soups.   The chicken soup which is on the menu and the chicken and rice which was the daily special.  Both were huge bowls of soup and bursting with flavor.  The chicken soup that is on the menu is not to be missed.  It has an Asian flair to it and has an amazing depth of flavor.   I would go back for the soup alone!  In our group we had the Shepard's Pie, burger, pastrami sandwich, Mac and Cheese and cucumber salad.    We had some Shepard's Pie fans in the crowd and it did not disappoint.  Although personally I am not a lamb fan, our guest that got this meal loved it.  Served in a big cast iron pan it was layered well and delicious.    The burger was ok.  It was over 20 dollars for a run of the mill burger though.   The shoestring fries were amazing.   The pastrami sandwich was epic. Delicious pumpernickel bread piled high with delicious pastrami.  Very lean and very tasty meat.  Gooey cheese and a swatch of sauerkraut made a delicious sandwich.   We would want more kraut on the sandwich going forward.  It was too little for us.    The Mac and cheese was phenomenal.  It was creamy, cooked perfectly with a crunch of breadcrumbs on the top.    Overall:   It gets the five stars despite a couple issues.  The highs were so amazing it doesn't impact to have a couple issues.   The prices are high but the food makes you forget it.  We did spend over 200, before tip, for four of us.",

    "text": "Lunch on the second day of it's opening was friendly and efficient. Generally we will wait a few weeks after opening to allow a new restaurant to work out any bugs. However, the opportunity presented itself and did not disappoint. The kitchen and servers were working as a well oiled machine. Our server Keiona provided a thorough explanation of the menu. She was spot on following up throughout our meal. Her associates also helped with removing finished dishes.   The dining room is a large space open to the casino on one side and a wall of windows on the opposite side. Seating was comfortable and tables were reasonably spaced. The background music was the same as the casino and was a little on the loud side.  Starting out with the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho which arrives with a ball of pineapple  sorbet floating in the center of the bowl. First you puree the sorbet so it mixes with the mint and the tomatoes. This was a delicious cold soup on a warm summer day. The pineapple flavor is a nice twist.  The next appetizer was the Lump Crab Arancini. 4 nice size balls crispy on the outside and tender  inside. The dish is perfectly matched with the lemon tarragon  creme frache, siracha  balsamic glaze. Great flavor.  Four entrees were selected.  Chicken Tenders, battered and  served with skinny fries, and celery sticks.  F&K Fondue Burger cooked medium. Black Angus meat, mushrooms, onions, crispy smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, on a brioche roll. Served with fries and a large bowl of fondue on the side. If the fondue is poured on the burger, you will definitely need the fork and knife. The burger was juicy, great smoky bacon. Not a big fan of the fondue.   Lobster Roll with sofrito mayo, lettuce, heirloom tomatoes on a grilled split top bun.  A large portion of lobster stuffed into a bun the resembles Texas Toast. Excellent taste, just melts in your mouth.  Focus on the lobster and not the generous serving of fries..  Ponzu Glazed Salmon served over red quinoa,  baby spinach and roasted onion salsa. The salmon was perfectly grilled and the Ponzu sauce provided a sweet tang.  Kudos to chef Robert for providing us with another choice of great dining.",

We tried the smoke chicken wings that were nothing special. Lacked flavour and was quite bland. For dinner we ordered the fish n chips were tasteful and a fair size. Really enjoyed the curry aioli which gave it a great twist. The other item we had was the grilled salmon which was absolutely amazing. Ive never had such a delicious salmon. Reall enjoyed the salmon with the caper vinaigrette.  For dessert the waiter convinced us to try the skillet baked triple chocolate cookie was literally melted in my mouth. Made fresh to order, took 10 min but let me tell you, if you enjoy fresh oooieeee goooieee cookie, then you will wait!",

It's pickiness, but when you have Robert Irvine's name, you expect excellence as he demands. The waterboy and food runner held that standard very well along with the quality of food. Went there May 4th for lunch around 230pm with my girlfriend. She had the F&K Burger and I had the Pastrami. Both of us upgraded to truffle parmesan fries. Both were completely amazing. We share our food, so I had the pleasure of eating both. That cheese sauce on the burger was like nothing I had before. Was done eating my fries when there was no cheese to scoop it up with. Speaking of dipping, would like to see chef Irvine make his own ketchup instead of Heinz at the table. Lol. Only cause I ate at Ramsay's burgers and the dips were amazing. An upgraded ketchup. That's my challenge for Mr Irvine. Food overall lived up to the standard!!!",

    "text": "I had food credit, so I decided to visit another celebrity chef restaurant. This time I went to Robert Irvine's Public House.  I got there as it opened, so it wasn't difficult to get seated.  There were several problems right off the bat. My party tried to order Bangers and Mash and a Shepherd's Pie, but they were out of the potatoes they use for the mashed potatoes. Which was unfortunate. Also they had a problem with one of their beer lines, so I couldn't get a proper Black and Tan.  I ended up getting the Guinness and Steak pie, and my friend got the Pastrami Sandwich. We also ordered the Carbonara Mac n Cheese.  The pie was delicious. The crust was buttery, the gravy was rich and had a great Guinness flavor. Nice tender slices of fingerling potatoes, carrots, onions, and of course steak. It was a little pricey. But tasted great.  The Pastrami sandwich was a marvel to look at. We were both too hungry when we got our food, so we forgot to take pictures. But trust me, it was amazing. The pastrami was flavorful, the sauerkraut cheese and mustard really brought it home. The fries were a little thin, but tasty.  The mac n cheese was fantastic. Everything about it. The cheese was creamy and flavorful, just the right consistency. The pasta was sort of a corkscrew shape and made it difficult to eat with a fork, but it was of course perfectly cooked. And the bacon was... bacon... so it was delicious.  All in all, the food is good, but the price is just too high to justify it.",

No need for any steak sauce!! Also had the tater tot poutine to start. The tots were crispy and there was a generous amount of pulled pork. Had a very bold steak flavor with the mushroom gravy on top. The drinks (mojito and watermelon mint cooler) were okay. Service was very friendly.   Spent about $150.   Would recommend if you're looking for a place that's not too fancy but not quite just a burger bar.",

    "text": "A local friend recommended we try here, and we were immediately skeptical of a downtown location. However, to make a long story short, we have already planned a return visit to try even more menu offerings.  Joys- Seating was quick and easy, in an open dinning area that made it that much easier to see what everyone else was having. Our waiter (George) arrived within minutes to take drink orders, recommend options, and even take our starting order. Usually I am nervous when they take an order without writing it down, but he seemed legitimately engaged in what we were having. It's rare to have a waiter who makes it look so easy. Our food was to die for! The putain, Mac and cheese, and steak and guinness pie were all out of this world! Amazing UK/pub food with a truly lovely twist. Honestly, you should plan multiple visits to try everything. I didn't get to try the f&k burger, but it was hard to not reach over and steal a bite from a neighboring table. It looked wonderful. The food was REAL food. Nothing seemed prefrozen, or like it was made the day befor. I felt like I was getting better than I paid for food-wise; just be careful with the drinks. It was so good, and our waiter was completely on point, that we actually decided to get dessert and an Irish coffee at the end. We almost never take that extra time, but this was worth it.  Cons- It is Las Vegas pricing, but I don't understand how a single Dr. PEPPER can justifiably cost $5. We will be sticking with water next time. I imagine that during their busiest hours it might get a little bit loud, so maybe not a great place to have a conversation. Coffee at the end was priced wrong, but our waiter caught and corrected that very quickly.  Honestly, 5 stars is more than deserved, and we look forward to going back! Thank you George, we will be asking to sit with you again.",

Our server, George, was very accommodating to our queries and very knowledgeable. He gave us more recommendations to try for next time.  When my husband and I first got here we thought that we would try the poutine, Mac and cheese, and the steak and Guinness pie. We were blown away by how amazing these were! So impressed we stayed and ordered dessert. Irish coffee and a bread pudding. The bread pudding sauce was particularly magical! We licked it off the plate. No shame. You do pay more here, but compared to everywhere else I've tried on the strip, you get what you pay for here. This is actual, scratch made, gastro pub food that fills you up and makes your soul do a happy dance. Even the people next to us were commenting how awesome this food is! We will most definately be back, eager to try George's reccommendations!",

Hubby had the F & K burger,  which was smothered in cheese sauce,  hence the name... you need a fork and knife to eat it.  Would have been nice if our server had mentioned that.   The appetizer was supposed to be free for hotel guests,  but we were charged for it until we reminded the server,  which could have been an oversight,  but a bit frustrating nonetheless.",

Had the (split with a friend) the lobster roll and pastrami Rachael. Lobster roll was fresh and had great flavor. Funny thing, the roll itself was wonderful as well. Almost stole the show. The pastrami was great with the nice bread, German mustard, sauerkraut and beautiful pastrami.  Side note, crispy fresh and delicious thin cut fries. The third guy got the shepherds pie special (they have a traditional Shepherds and a special chef creation on the menu). This special had a creamy chicken inside.

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to give this place 2/5. What I liked about this place is that the atmosphere is great. You typically have a lot of poorly decorated restaurants in Las Vegas, but this place was done nicely. It looked like something straight out of HGTv. There were plenty of TVs all over the restaurant for you to catch up on games throughout the day. They have plenty of drinks on tap and a fully stocked bar.  The service was pretty good. I came to the restaurant with a group of about 10. They did a good job in making sure we were accommodated. For example, one friend wanted chipotle sauce for a dish and the chef came out and talked to him. They weren't able to make it but he offered alternatives.  I ordered fish and chips and the warm bread pudding. With the fish and chips, I wasn't looking for great just something that was safe and regular. I didn't like the amount of bread on the fish, I felt it also could have been seasoned better. I also didn't like what they did with the fries. They have a malted curry aioli and cold slaw in it. The fish sat on top of the fries as well. It gave the fries a fishy taste and it was too salty with no ketchup. I wish they would have separated the two, and just made the fries plain and gave you dip to try it. The fish didn't come with any sauce either so, I guess they want you to eat it plain or with the \"seasoned\" fries. Typically fish and chips are a safe dish, and I couldn't even finish it even though it was my first meal of the day at 1 pm after a night of raging.  I ordered desert and I was told the bread budding and the apple pie were the favorites. I picked bread pudding. Again, I was disappointed. It has some type of cherry sauce. And it just made me disappointed and hungry when I left.  My friends ordered various food and they all had similar complaints of the quality of food. I had friends that enjoyed the Lobster Roll--I wish I would have ordered that. All the entrees looked pretty and they all had a unique twist.   Overall, beautiful environment wish the food matched up. I won't say I held this place to a higher standard because I didn't know it was Irvine's restaurant until after I had eaten. I didn't look at the store title, my friend just told us to go after walking aimlessly looking for an open restaurant that we didn't have to wait an hour to be seated. If you go, I highly recommend you read the menu before you order and look at the ingredients.",

    "text": "What a great new find on the strip that I can rate a 5 and want to come back to that didn't rob the bank with crappy overpriced food!   The ambiance of the renovated Trop is perfect for the Public House. We all enjoyed the food and time together and experience overall!  Sharing plates to try everything, we had the duck confit, poutine, wild mushroom flatbread, and shaved kale salad. We were very pleased with all of the above! The poutine was so pretty! On tater tots, loaded with goat cheese and gravy it was to die for. The duck melted in your mouth. The salad was super tasty and cut into a size you didn't have to get messy with. The flatbread didn't disappoint.  Bravo with this menu, Mr. Irvine.",

I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. This is a must for every visit to Vegas now which will be soon since we are locals to Nevada.",

    "text": "Tropicana has not been one of my top picks for dining so I was excited to see a new restaurant opening on property. This restaurant is located on the casino level, not upstairs with the other restaurants.  I dined with a friend and since neither of us was starving we decided to share a meal. We started with the Mixed Heirloom Tomatoes & Grilled Ciabatta. This was an awesome starter that we both loved. The avocado and lemon ricotta on the toast was so good. It definitely gave the salad a nice pop of flavor. The portion on this was generous and was perfect to share between two people.   Fish & Chips made for our main entree. The fish was a nice large piece that was flaky inside and crispy on the outside. We both liked the fish. The chips were pretty good, but we both agreed that the malted curry aioli was not the best flavor. My friend and I aren't picky eaters so it's unusual for us to dislike something. I think the chips would have been better without the sauce. We found ourselves picking through the fries trying to find some that didn't have sauce on them.  The finale to the meal was the Warm Bread Pudding. It was between this and Banoffee Pie. I asked about the two and the waiter explained that the banoffee is served cold and the bread pudding is served hot. The bread pudding wasn't out of this world for either of us. The strawberry anglaise and rhubarb chutney were really good, but the bread part didn't have much flavor. I don't think I would order this again.   Our waiter was great. He was friendly and attentive. He had good information about the menu when I asked and he definitely knew the menu well. The staff assisting him was on top of water refills and clearing empty plates.   Overall, the best casual option at The Tropicana. The service and food were good so I wouldn't hesitate to return.",

Because of this we only order the specialties. Here is how it went; appetizer hot wings- under cooked and swimming in what I think was Franks Red-hot sauce and a few pickles and under cooked, unless he meant pollo-rojo. Fish and chips (a English chefs \"staple\") Over cooked on one side nearly raw on other and tasted / consistency of Elmer's glue. Wife's Asian chicken salad, well it had plenty of cabbage and peanuts, like a lot of nuts and cabbage, and a sliver of avocado.  Dessert; Cannoli or rather wooden  shells and sandy/gritty filling. Good to see Irvine is embracing hiring worse cooks in America after they are on his show.",

    "text": "WOW!  I must say I had high expectations coming in here being a Robert Irvine location.   I've seen him on TV and have always wanted to check out a place he's been or owns.   Having the opportunity to do it here was great for me.     First this is a brand new spot so it's shiny and trendy.   I like that.  I came in about 11:30 AM local time and clearly beat the lunch rush as it was pretty slow, so this made for great service!   The host sat me quickly and my waiter was by shortly after.   He did a great job and checked on me regularly.  The food was spot on!  I ordered an appetizer and a cheeseburger and in no way had the capacity to finish it all off!   I had the Irish nachos to start.  Boy was that amazing!   For my entree I had the fondue burger.  This was a surprise for me.  I'd never seen this on a menu so I had to try it.  A MASSIVE burger came out and on the side was a bowl of cheese.  My waiter literally poured the fondue all over the cut in half behemoth!    I had no choice but to eat with the fork and knife that was delivered just for this meal.  So all in all I had a very delightful experience here.   If staying at the Tropicana it's worth it to check this spot out!!!",

    "text": "Since my girlfriends and I were staying at the Tropicana, I was eager to try out Robert Irvine's newest restaurant. Part convenience, part foodie, and the need to explore brought on the excitement both times I went during our stay.  The place has a very cool interior which is a completely open, fresh, and modern.   The food I must say was really good. Our favorites included the asparagus (yes you read correctly, the asparagus), skirt steak, and chicken wings. The wings are dressed on a plated garlic bread strip and covered with spicy buffalo sauce. The wings have a really nice kick to it!  My favorite was the F&K Burger... it was out of this world delicious. I chose to have the warm fondue cheese that accompanies the burger to be set on the side. Well after a few moments, I ended up pouring some of the deliciously warm and butter tasting cheese over the well dressed burger as they show on the menu. Then I'd dip each bite into the bowl of fondue cheese. What an experience!  As a new restaurant, there are a few kinks that still needs to be worked out. For example, our server Wendy was a nice lady but clearly had too many tables. She did her best to get us our missing items as quickly as possible. Since we were on vacation and having drinks, the wait really didn't bother us however others may have had an issue.   The other issue was that one drink in particular that my niece wanted was unavailable due to a few missing ingredients.   Since the restaurant has only been open for just 15 days when we went, I can still say that this was a really good restaurant to visit. Yes there are a slew of other restaurants in the area but here you can expect quality food, simple yet palette pleasing dishes, nice decor, great view, and a different spin on your favorite dishes.   I'll be back when I'm back in the area!",

The surroundings were outstanding, the whole experience was surreal.    It's inside the Tropicana, parking is free which is a novelty in Vegas now with MGM charging for parking at all their properties.  The hotel is fresh and clean - we will be back often, this was an unusually good experience.",

The other one is out.... nice of them to give me a choice.   Food is bland. Pulled pork and pasta didn't work. Not sure how a wedge salad gets messed up, but it didn't taste good.  Overall impression was overpriced bland food with disorganized service.  This is a follow up. I didn't hear this but the server apparently said \"figured you wouldn't notice\" regarding the beer switch. Also, my father in law complained that the rabbit pie had large bones. The same server replied \"yeah, that happen\". Not the expected answer!  On a good note; I explained this whole saga to the general manager who immediately comped some food and poured complimentary drinks. This at least was handled correctly and professionally.",

Ambience/Environment: Very casual; dining room opens onto the casino floor so you get sounds of casino and passersby throughout service.   Menu: A fun mix of comfort food staples and elevated, more formal cuisine. Enough variety here to make just about anyone happy. Wine list was a disappointment, but MANY beers on tap.   Food:  Steak Tartare: Delicious! Healthy portion for 2 people, with homemade potato chips. Lightly dressed, perfect ratios. French Onion Fondue: Fun dip bringing the flavor of french onion soup...this one is ADDICTING! We quickly were scraping bread rounds around the bowl hoping for more. If you like queso you will love this unique take! Chicken-Fried Duck Confit: Spectacular! A fun take on duck, and generous portion. Flavors melded perfectly. I would come back for this dish alone. Lobster Roll: A classic take on a lobster roll...Sarah seemed to thoroughly enjoy it (lobster was tender and juicy!) and we BOTH enjoyed the fries that accompanied it.

    "text": "My husband and I are big fans of Robert. We made reservations at his restaurant at his restaurant specifically on our last night in Vegas AND to celebrate my husband's birthday. My husband joked he had hoped Robert would be there to wish him a happy birthday. In a matter of minutes, I happened to look at two gentlemen across from us. One was holding up his cell phone and you will never guess who he was talking too. IT WAS ROBERT!!!! I told my husband to look slowly as I think Robert noticed I saw him and asked his friend to put his phone down a little. Luckily hubby caught a glimpse of him anyway which made him smiles.  When our food arrived well our smiles kinda went away a little. My husband said someone on Facebook suggested the French Onion fondue. Before I say anything else, both myself and hubs had terrible colds so our taste buds were not at their best. The fondue was just ok. It tasted more like french onion soup but just extra thick. I thought it would be served in a fondue bowl but it comes out on a platter. It's accompanied with french garlic bread slices. They were delicious and baked at the right crispy texture for dipping. It was just difficult to get the fondue to stick to the bread.  We did not finish it because we wanted to make sure we \"saved room\" for our entrees.  My Burger-  I ordered the Original burger.  Since I had a cold, I wanted something soft but filling. Well you do get that with this burger but with a twist. The description said it comes with PH sauce. I did not ask our waiter what that was because I trust Robert's cooking and recipe development. I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Well I was surprised but not quite on the pleasant level.  The burger arrived oozing of sauce or cheesy sauce. When my husband saw it he said \"You are going to have a hard time eating that\". He was right. Even though I am a woman, anytime I order a burger (unless it's wrapped in lettuce..don't ask) I am picking that sucker up with my perfectly polished hands! Yes I believe burgers are meant to be eaten with hands not a knife and fork. Well the sauce made the burger patties so slippery, I could not really get more than one bite in before I had to slice and eat it with a fork. I felt defeated. I also thought it would be a thicker patty, instead there were two and they were on the thin side. I thought well at least I have fries.  My Fries- Since this was a birthday celebration and our last night in Vegas...plus a cold okay enough stupid reasons why I kept the fries when I should asked for veggies when I am supposed to be on a diet!  I was looking forward to them because they looked beautiful. When I bit into the first one, it lacked flavor. Again I am working with impacted taste buds but surely I thought I would get a little kick of something. Alas...no.  The french fries here reminded me sadly of the ones at In and Out Burger. I know there are many fans of that chain. I am not one of them and especially not of their fries. Robert's fries were 1 and only 1 notch above theirs. My only thoughts were it has to be the oil they use to fry them. It must be a different type of oil than beef talo. I know a little about oils because I once worked for Kraft Food Services. I used  to take orders for restaurants so I had an \"education\" on how oils can change the flavors of fries. I was shocked the fries were flat tasting. As a result, I did not finish off the fries which is rare for me.  Overall Experience- Robert's place is beautiful! Great layout. I was surprised how nice the Tropicana is just in general. It looks practically new when you walk into the lobby. I can see why Robert decided to have his restaurant here. I wish I could rate his food higher. I just expected more because of who he is in the food industry. I am not giving up here. Robert is good at tweaking. It's my hope he will see the reviews here and make some adjustments. I would like to give his place another chance.  The staff is quite friendly and energetic. I did not see anyone with an attitude or goofing off. Everyone walked around as if they had a purpose. We never felt overlooked.   Suggestion to Public House-  Please make your Original burger simple!!! When you give a menu item that name, one thinks this is their 1st and or easiest rendition. This burger was not easy and definitely not simple.  My last suggestion is compare your fries to In and Out and then your competitors in Vegas like Whalburgers or Gordon Ramseys. Their basic fries just have that flavor you would expect where they taste less \"potatoey\" than yours.  They are not greasy by any means and neither are yours. Good fries don't need to be greasy to be good. Yours just need a little extra umph! :-)  i hope you take this a constructive feedback. Your place adds class to the strip and is a big plus to the Tropicana.  It was nice getting a glimpse of Robert too even though it was on someone's cell phone!",

Had to ask and wait like 10 minutes for some salt.  Manager never came over to apologize! I certainly hope Robert Irvine reads this.  Out server has all but disappeared.",

Very spacious, nice atmosphere with awesome modern decor, full bar & lots of TV's for sports/news. Variety of different foods on the menu with their most popular/known for highlighted. Went there at 12pm on Monday & wasn't very busy at all. Service was great. We parked in the free outside parking lot right by the entrance off of Tropicana, you walk in, go up the escalators & the entrance to this restaurant is to the left.  Their chicken wings are the bomb! Buffalo flavor & cooked perfectly. Heirloom tomatoes & grilled ciabatta, I don't know what exactly was all on it but.. delish! A must! A small dish but we were able to cut into 3 pieces for the 3 of us. Their salmon was mouth watering, grilled to perfection & amazing flavor! Spinach & red quinoa to go along with it. TheF&K burger my friend got looked large & delicious with a side of fondue cheese to pour all over it (or dip) & shoestring, seasoned fries. Also looked like fried bacon was on there. Definitely unique dishes.  I highly recommend!",

    "text": "I was excited to try Robert Irvine's restaurant after watching his critiquing on TV for year. What a joke, if you like hair served with your food, and I mean cooked deep in your food where your pulling it out of your throat and gagging, this is the place to go.  We had a party of 4, ordered 4 plates of food.  Fish and, some kind of beef casserole, wings, fries that were smothered in a very liquids sauce and feta cheese that had very little flavor and very soggy.  The fish was ok, the wings came with the very long strands of hair.  I am one to never ever complain about food, but a server informed me that for the amount of money we dish out for our food we should complain, so my husband informed or server Fred, who was like  hmmm, asked if we maybe wanted something else which after pulling a long black hair from my throat I was like no, then he offered the dessert menu which I was still like no, not chancing the hair especially if the restaurant does not care about the quality of myHe brought our check and was like have a great night.    To the person that responded to my review.  You had a chance to respond to my concern during my dining experience.  I informed the server more than once about the hair pulled out of my throat that was cooked into the food.  He did not care to address the problem, offer to take the food off our bill or get a manager to address the problem.  Maybe you should address your staff in how to handle these issues instead of shaming customer who did bring it to the staffs attention.",

I would imagine there was a lot of pressure on the staff and they seemed overwhelmed. We received our drinks after we received our food and when they eventually came the order was incorrect. The desserts looked good as we saw from a few nearby tables however by the time we went to order they had ran out of 2 of the 6 desserts that were in the menu. The appetizers that we ordered was poutine ($15) and steak tartare ($19) both were fair not great. The spot is fairly large, they can definitely pack a lot of ppl in here and would be good for large parties. It's bright inside and the outter tables have window seats overlooking the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Decided to give Robert Irvine's public house a second try. Was very pleasantly surprised with how far along they've come since opening weekend. We were greeted by the front desk host in the most warm welcomed manner. I was immediately taken to my table, and immediately had our waiter bring our drinks out. We ordered three appetizers, the chicken wings, the steak tartare, and the French onion fondue. Impossible for me to pick which one was the winner as all three were above and beyond amazingly delicious. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection with a perfect glaze sitting on a wonderful warm crostini. The French onion fondue was so amazing that I started scooping it up with just the spoon bypassing the Bread. The state tartare was extremely high end, better than most of the steak tartare I've had in expensive restaurants.   My partner ordered the shepherds pie, made out of lamb. One word came to mind when I tried it, orgasmic!!!   I ordered the steak and fries that came with beautiful asparagus spears. The steak was cooked to perfection with a wonderful delicious chimichurri sauce.   All in all I gave my second trip to Robert Irvine's public house a five star because there wasn't a single thing that I can honestly say what's mediocre. Everything and everyone was perfect!!!!  As a foodie, I definitely definitely highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for high-quality excellent service great food within a reasonable budget.",

Being it was the first night, and not open to the public till tomorrow night it was hectic but in a good way with excited guest, we ordered appetizers and drafts first and the first thing I tasted is the reason I'm going back,the crab oranchini!  they were tasty crispy on the outside and delish on the inside, the pizza was spot on and the poutine  with pulled pork was hard to stop eating, we ordered the lamb shanks and  shepherd pie and both were great,  great coffee and desert and  I was a very happy man.

    "text": "While staying at the Tropicana back in August, my girlfriend and I woke up famished after a night on the town and decided we didn't want to wander too far for lunch, so we went to the lobby and followed the signs to Robert Irvine's Public House, just steps from the concierge. I've always liked Irvine on Restaurant: Impossible due to his rational yet seething attitude when dealing with careless restaurateurs and staff - I always crack up when he loses it, but he always manages to come up with a winning plan to turn things around. Reality television aside, the main reason we stopped in, aside from the location, was the well-rounded pub grub menu and, of course, hair of the dog.   Upon walking in, we loved the open concept with a large wraparound bar that livened the place up. Seating options abound - the place was pretty empty when we dined for lunch -  both at the bar and at a variety of tables. Our server was a charismatic man in his forties who took care of our orders promptly and without error.   The menu prices at Robert Irvine's Public House are just above average for pub grub; appetizer options range from $14 - Spiced Lamb Croquettes or the Traditional Poutine - to $18 - Lump Crab & Pancetta Arancini or Japanese Yellowtail Poke. The salads are all modestly priced for the creativity, but the portions are small for what you're dishing out. The burgers, sandwiches and pizzas are the best bang for your buck - all are between $12 and $23. Keep in mind this is the lunch menu; on the dinner menu they feature more of the same, plus some mains.  I chowed down on the Stone Fired Shepherds Pie ($24), which for some reason was featured on their lunch list at the time, yet looking back on it now I'm only seeing it listed for dinner. The pie came loaded with ground lamb, onion, English peas, and a mashed potato crust. It was prepared excellently, the lamb not dried out nor sitting in liquid, and the peas were slightly sweet and soft, contrasting the fluffy potatoes beneath the crust. At first the portion seemed undersized served in a cast iron pan, but I left stuffed and ready for more partying! Adding to that, my girl thoroughly enjoyed her Grilled Chicken Breast sandwich ($17), featuring a soft chicken breast, watercress, avocado, fig marmalade, Brie, balsamic mustard, all loaded on a toasted Ciabatta. All sandwiches and burgers come with a side of fries. She seemed to enjoy the cocktail she got and I had a chance to down some beers from Colorado's now-famous New Belgian Brewing - one of many craft beer selections on the extensive drinks menu.   Robert Irvine's is a solid contender for upscale public house munchies, with innovative yet accessible food dominating the menu. Having the option to try traditional dishes ranging from Oysters (market price) or Steak Tartare to Braised Lamb Shank or Ponzu Glazed Grilled Salmon is the type of variety many pub diners are seeking more of, so good on Irvine for stepping up to the plate. The service was excellent, the prices were average (for Vegas, at least) and the food - pretty damn good! To bump this up to five stars, however, I think a touch of culinary modernization couldn't hurt.",

    "text": "Laid back atmosphere. Our bartender was great and other staff members were engaging and willing to help out with our questions not necessarily dealing with just the restaurant. For a guy that hasn't been to Vegas in 10 years and a friend that has never been, it was a great experience.  Now to the food.....very very good. The French Onion Fondue is amazing! And they will give you more ciabatta at no extra charge. We fully came prepared to eat our faces off there but we inquired about the soup of the day....yeah, I get it, soup in Vegas? But we both come from the Midwest so you can judge a place by their soup. We fortunately had the \"seafood soup\". I have stopped thinking about that bowl since. They call it seafood soup in my opinion because the classic cioppino has crab and scallops...this soup didn't need the extras. Broth was beautiful, hint of spice but didn't overpower the lobster and halibut. Definitely a top 5 soup I've ever had. Great food, big portions for Vegas, nice people, prices are perfect, great engaging service, and everything you want without a $300 bill. My buddy went back (I had to leave a day earlier) and had the skirt steak and said it was phenomenal. Great spot for a great meal and service",

Whew...or Wow...or Whoa...or Whatever you want to call it for one piece of fish(tho pretty good size and tasty) and a small, small serving of average coleslaw. I didn't realize the fries came with all the toppings, NOT AT ALL my thing but my fault for not understanding the description I guess. I ate about a 1/3rd of them and that was plenty. The Pepsi was  AWESOME  lol. I think I'm being generous with four stars, I didn't have to pay as I had a food comp from the Tropicana so I can only complain so much about the price. Next time(tomorrow) I think I might try either their burger one of the pizzas, the cpl sitting next to had one and it looked good. Morgan behind the bar was a great server five stars, the gal who delivered the food one star, looked really pissed and mad for having to be there and being bothered.",

We stopped in for a late dinner, given it sits in the Tropicana casino.  Pretty simple order for my wife and I to split. Wedge salad, classic poutine and public house burger.  Wedge and dressing had good taste, but really under dressed (and I like my dressing on lighter side).  Poutine, nothing about this was good. Dry as far as gravy, actually didn't really see any, cold and coagulated bowl. Pretty sad F on the poutine.  Burger, overall ingredients not bad. Flavor decent temp on the cold side, egg over hard so didn't run. But burger temp was supposed to be pink, it was gray.  Maybe Robert Irvine needs to come back and do an assessment.   Went expecting a positive dining experience, ended up really disappointed!",

    "text": "Myself and another couple enjoyed 3 entrees: the salmon, the shepards pie and the lamb shank. I'd just like to say, Robert Irvine lives up to his reputation as a chef who can make a dish seem like it took 24 hours to prepare while constrained by time it takes to deliver food quickly to hungry patrons. The salmon glaze left us wondering, how could such flavorful carmelization complement so well with the fresh-caught flavor of the fish? The shepards pie made with ground lamb remarkably did not leave a greasy after-taste. The word I'd use for every mouthful is sumptuous. And then, there was the lamb shank. How did Robert Irvine devise a recipe that would explode in your mouth with such flavor and yet not be overpowered by sweetness? If you like rich mesquite wood smoke in bbq meat, try the lamb shank. It's amazing!",

    "text": "Underwhelmed....  Went by to grab a late lunch at 3 pm but were told the hours had changed and they only served a limited menu. And, they were not seating at the tables. Only at the bar. Even though there was a perfectly good table right in front of the only TV playing the game we wanted to watch we were relegated to small high tops which were too far away to really watch the game. For a place that advertises its football specials and as the place to watch the game, you'd think they'd maximize access to the TVs!  The TVs are lined up over the bar, making it hard to really watch any game unless you are sitting at or around the bar.   Anyways, on to the \"limited\" menu. There were a number of appetizers available but the only entrees were pizzas.   The mushroom pizza with goat cheese and arugula sounded fantastic from the description. However, it was easily the most disappointing.  It was at its base a cheese pizza with a red sauce base and mozzarella, and to be honest that's pretty much what it tasted like. I couldn't even taste the mushrooms at all. The crust was nicely done on the outside but was too thin and soggy in the middle to really hold up the ingredients. Now I love me a good crust. However, even while the edible outer crust was well cooked, it was lacking flavor.... salt? The featured ingredients were more like an afterthought sparsely sprinkled on top: a few under seasoned mushrooms, a few blobs of carmelized onion, and a bit of goat cheese. It was topped by a reasonable mound of arugula. The arugula was fresh but you could have fooled me that it had a truffle vinaigrette as there was no aroma or taste of truffles. Why even mention the truffle vinaigrette? Overall, I wouldn't have known this even was a mushroom pizza if I hadn't pushed aside the arugula to double check.   The pepperoni pizza was marginally better, only because the sparse bits of pepperoni actually added a bit of salt to the otherwise bland pizza. My boyfriend had to ask what the brown spiral over his pizza was.... It was  pesto, that had apparently been baked along with the pizza. In my opinion, pesto is best fresh with minimal heating. It would have had better effect if drizzled on post-baking.   The only thing that was truly good was the hamachi poke, which tasted fresh and well seasoned with green onions, sesame oil, and, I'm guessing miso paste. It was unfortunately served with six-seven small fragments of taro chips, not nearly enough. Our server was relatively absent and we were hungry so we never got the chance to ask for more.   The service was basic, no frills, pretty standard for a bar I suppose. I guess I expected a little better than standard though.",
