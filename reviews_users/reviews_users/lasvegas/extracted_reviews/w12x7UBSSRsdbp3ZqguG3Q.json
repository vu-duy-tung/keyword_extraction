But when beloved out-of-town family are visiting, and when they're dying to see their 4 1/2 month old grandnephew, and when they wanna eat at Palm.... and when they're paying? Baby in a dressy restaurant. Here we go.   Service was excellent and our server Alan was very attentive and sweet. He quite astonishingly remembered all the names of our party that my aunt threw out at him. AND Alan was gracious enough to give us a fancy \"to-go\" cup for hubby's coffee when he got up and took a turn wheeling crabby babes around the forum shops.   The split pea and ham soup was AH-mazing, as was the lobster bisque, and the wedge and caesar salads were good, good, good. Hubby didn't absolutely love his pastrami sandwich but he also isn't a fan of rye bread so I'm not sure he's an adequate judge.  Don't bring your baby. Or do if you have to. I get it.",

    "text": "***The food at The Palm Restaurant was not that great and the service was awful on our visit***  I have been to The Palm Restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles and I did not enjoy it that much.  We went for lunch and I had their steak frites and, unfortunately, they were using really poor quality beef (a New York Strip but not a good one).  You do have to use less expensive beef than dinner to serve steak but still achieve a reasonable lunch price, but most restaurants like Lucques do not settle for lower quality; instead, they just showcase a cheaper cut like hanger steak.  Since I went to the Downtown LA Palm for lunch, I did not get a chance to try their signature Prime steaks.  I could have tried them at my recent trip to the Las Vegas location (The Palm is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace), but I opted for one of their other signature items instead--lobster.  I had their jumbo lobster tail and it was actually pretty good.  The lobster was huge--it was almost a pound--and the lobster meat was good--fresh, moist, lightly sweet, and fairly soft.  The seasoning of the lobster was also good--flavorful with a little bit of spice but not overpowering.  Almost everything else was not good though.  The crab cakes were soft and mushy.  The baked clams were bad.  The clams were too small (very unlike the rest of the food here) and the clams were just rubbery and kind of bland.  The Jumbo Shrimp Bruno was surprisingly good though.  This was shrimp francaise sauteed in a butter sauce.  The shrimp was incredibly soft and while I am not a huge fan of restaurants that go overboard with the butter, the richness and butteriness of this dish really worked.  The sides ranged from just okay to bad.  I do not really like creamed spinach, but this one definitely had the creaminess and richness that creamed spinach fans would probably like.  The asparagus fritti (deep fried asparagus) was fine.  The hash brown potatoes were also okay, but they were nothing really special.  The green beans were bad.  They were overcooked and bland.  Maybe someone on the table asked for them to be served plain because they definitely seemed to be missing the garnishes of pancetta, pepper flakes and pine nuts.  For dessert, I tried the warm bag of doughnuts and they were very dense.  The doughnuts came with dipping sauces including chocolate and raspberry.  While I did not try any of the steak here, the steak did look good.  Some of the cuts looked a little small, but the cooking on the meat seemed to be very nice.  The center of the filet I saw was nicely red and juicy.  My friend said the temperature of the steak was nearly perfect, but the seasoning was not that great (a little bland).  Prices were very high.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be overpriced and given that The Palm features high quality beef, it is no surprise that the food here is very expensive.  Service was awful.  While I would say the food was in the mediocre to occasionally decent range, the service we experienced was very bad.  Our server did not seem to be a server at all because it really felt like he did not know what he was doing.  For example, we were a big table and he took the first two drink orders, left and then came back with just those two drinks.  It looked like he was going to continue to do this (I guess because he only had two hands), but we stopped him and told him to put in the whole drink order at once.  Putting in our dinner order took forever because our server just seemed to disappear for long stretches of time.  And when he was present, he had an abrupt approach that was a little off-putting.  He also did not seem to be getting everything down, but the restaurant was also very, very loud.  The food itself came out at a decent pace so maybe service would be better under a different server.  As mentioned, the restaurant was quite loud.  The atmosphere was kind of like an old-fashioned supper club.  Similar to the LA location, they have celebrity caricatures on the walls.  Given that The Palm has multiple locations throughout the country, I would not suggest heading here first for a high quality steak or a big lobster.  Carnevino in The Palazzo offers very high quality steaks and the sides and starters are much more unique and delicious than The Palm (plus, that restaurant is more unique to the area).  I think The Palm is really a last option given the high prices, the just okay food and the fact that it is a pretty big chain.  As mentioned, The Palm Restaurant is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  The Forum Shops offer both free self and valet parking.",

He had the Panko encrusted Ahi Tuna.  It was very good.  I had the lobster roll.  It was rich and creamy lobster salad on a kaiser roll...very good.  They must be known for their lobster, because there were several people eating that.  Our entrees were about $20 each.    They have a good wine list.  We had a bottle of Hartford Ct Chardonnay for $97.  Rodney Strong Chardonnay was $14 for a small pour, $20 for a large pour.    We also had an amazing server (David W).  He was very personable and fun.  We took a few more breaks at the bar in between shopping, and I have to say the bartenders and servers were all very attentive and great at what they do.  Nice atmosphere - we sat on the \"patio\" which is outside of the restaurant, but inside The Forum, so opportunity for people watching.  The bar area was fun with the caricatures all over the wall, and there are TVs if you're a sports fan.",

    "text": "We had the three course offer and the whole dinner started great with a basket of variated breads. All three of us had the lobster soup and were really impressed by it. Not a lot of lobster, but all of us really liked it and the spoon was wonderful to eat with. From there it only went downhill.  I don't know where to start. Maybe with the least bad, the wine. The red wine of the house had a dusty aftertaste and my friends recommended wine was really sour.  For the entree I had the filet mignon and my friends the 20oz porterhouse steak. It looked great on the menu and there was massive advertisement about this place in the galleria. I ordered mine medium-rare because I like it, but the waiter quickly corrected me with a simple \"medium\" and wrote it on his paper. End of discussion.  To this we ordered the three cheese potato au gratin since we wanted some more than just a piece of meat. We shouldn't. I love potato gratin but this one would start a new revolution if it was served in France. Too much cheese and no texture at all. Felt like creamy lumps. The filet mignon came and I would have prefered it medium-rare, which I told him. That wasn't the biggest problem though. It didn't taste anything at all. The texture was nice but I didn't taste any of the seasoning - at all! And it wasn't served with a sauce or anything. The porterhouse was a big piece of meat, but it felt like we got the left over pieces. The aioli was a bit too sour, but still one of the best things. The meat tasted too much rosemary and my friends got bored of it and I understand why by the little I tried.  By now we were really disappointed and hoped for the dessert. Which was a disaster that all three of us leaved half way through. It was a big piece of microwaved brownie with a watery vanilla sauce and some sad jam. I don't even want to review it.  The worste part pf the whole experience wasn't the food though. The fact that it is Las Vegas and that the place is located in a galleria, fine, but we didn't feel any genuine service at all. It's not often you hear that you got the food too quick, but that's what happened here. It seemed like all the food was pre-made and only waited to be thrown out at the table so that we could pay and they could have new guests to rob. They won - we lost. $250 bucks in the ocean.",

At 10pm I would expect to be seated where they would get us in and out as quickly as possible. As we started receiving our apps, the entire dining room had cleared out and she continued to give us THE BEST service! We were hurrying to eat and get out so they could close but she insisted that we enjoy ourselves and not to rush. Our drinks were far from weak, our shrimp & ahi apps, lobster bisque , wedge salad, and steaks were perfection. And to top it off I was a little cold and Anna noticed and brought me a warm towel for my hands and linen to wrap around me. I mean service doesn't get any better than this!!!

I decided to order dinner and ordered the caesar salad, 14oz fillet and half and half (fries and onion strings).   My food was excellent. The salad had a wonderful dressing, and lots of cheese. My steak was cooked to perfection and i completely devoured the whole thing. The only item I didn't finish was the half and half, and that was because I wanted to make sure i could finish my steak, it was that good.

    "text": "Solid food, but the ridiculously bad service loses the Palm a star.   We were a large party of 8, all ordering steak and lobster and wine. You would think service would be pretty damn attentive. Unfortunately our waiter was complete aloof and often rude. Small details were overlooked (NO at a restaurant this expensive it is not acceptable to give ladies wearing black pants a freaking white napkin!). Stuff like this is forgiveable if the waitstaff has an ounce of warmth or personality.   We perused the appetizers on the menu and they were all pretty freaking dull. The lobster sliders and mini crab cakes from the bar menu sounded more appealing, but the waiter turned down our request to order appetizers from the bar initially. We asked \"what if we pay full price (it was happy hour)\" and he still said no. Five minutes later he akwardly returns and says he guesses he can let us?!?!? Thanks jerk. The apps from the bar menu were crappy and not worth it, btw. Oh well.   The surf and turf here is solid. It's not inspired or interesting, but it's reliable and of good quality. It is pricey for what you get, however, and the food didn't blow my mind. The four pound lobsters are HUGE I will say, and it's nice they split them for you. They also will crack the claw to make the enormous claw easier to eat. Props for that.   Desserts weren't particularly interesting, either, but they were tasty. The key lime pie was my favorite - a very well done piece of pie.   Overall this is your standard pricey steak joint. I had an amazing time at my dinner because I was in great company. Luckily the awful waitstaff didn't ruin our evening. With so many awesome steakhouses in Vegas I'm not sure if I'd come back to the Palm on my own. I will say if you're playing it safe in Vegas and want a well executed surf and turf, it's worth giving this place a shot.",

    "text": "After 10 years of working in the service industry in fine dining restaurants, I have now officially had my worst dining experience, EVER!   It was my girlfriends first time in Vegas, so I thought I would treat her to a nice dinner and choose Palm due to its review and close proximity to where we were staying. Our server was great right off the bat; very friendly and bubbly and able to describe the menu and the evenings specials. We started with a beefsteak tomato Capri which was delicious. It goes down hill from here. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium-rare, sides of Au gratin potatoes and creamed corn, and my gf was convinced to order the nights special of prime rib instead of the filet mignon. The sides were more of a highlight than the prime beef.   My ribeye was cooked more to a black and blue than medium rare - it was okay since I prefer my steak to have its natural juices - but came out at a \"lukewarm\" temperature rather than warm or even hot. The prime rib must have been given a salt bath for 30 days because it was the most over salted piece of meat I've ever had the displeasure of tasting; no natural flavor existed. Maybe the meat was over salted to cover up its rancid flavor(I'll come back to that comment later). The server was made aware of the dislike of her meal and offered to replace the dish, but my gf had already lost her appetite, so we declined. Not another bite  was taken from the 28oz $60 prime rib by either of us.  Later, our server came back to ask if we were finished eating, and I tell her yes, although there was still a significant amount of food still left on the plates. She quickly picked up our plates and rushed of to the kitchen. I raised an eyebrow to the fact that maybe she was just going to pack the leftovers to go. She returns with a desert menu and offers a desert on the house to make up for the prime rib.  After eating the creme brulee (very good, by the way), the server returns with our check. I am now wondering where all our food had gone. I ask the hostess if they pack leftover meals to go and she tells me yes. I explain my situation, to take our meals home was not even offered. The hostess and two managers then seemed to be discussing the issue with the server who returned to apologize for the miscommunication error. The hostess returned to the table with the check and explained that it was MY fault I didn't relay that I wanted the food to go, despite more than 50% of the meal was left. She comped our drinks, but we were still charged for the rancid prime rib. I paid the bill, left a 20% tip and left to never come back again.   En route to our hotel/casino after dinner, my gf began to feel ill. She threw up what she had eaten, once having to run in to a random casino, and again when we arrived back to our room. I felt fine. We can only assume it was the prime rib that caused her to become ill. It was the only thing she had to eat that I didn't, which leads me to believe the prime rib was turning bad, so it was over salted to cover up the rancid flavor.  All in all, our server did a great job, except for the leftovers hiccup. The management staff seemed to be a bit snarky and unapologetic considering the experience. I will never return to this restaurant and I will definitely be spreading the word of our terrible experience.",

    "text": "We walked by Palm Restaurant earlier in the day and the prices and menu looked good so we decided to have dinner before going to Omnia.  We ate light during the day to save our appetite, boy was that a mistake! Before I start, I would like to say the 2 busser's were working very hard and if it wasn't for them, the experience would be disastrous, I really hope they are promoted to waiters soon.  We all knew things were headed downhill when we asked the waiter what our side options were for our 4 & 6 lb. lobster plate and he said, \"It's in the menu.\"  To give that type of response to a patron is not acceptable anywhere, not even McDonalds or Taco Bell. We should have immediately gone up and left but we  gave them the benefit of doubt, which was a big mistake. It took forever to get our bread, to which the busser overheard us and went and immediately got us  bread. Our waiter lied to us and said one of their busser's went on strike which is why service was slow, really?? We spoke with the manager, and while he was apologetic, they didn't really do anything else to make our experience more pleasurable. We asked to switch our waiter, the new waitress was a lot better but by this time the damage had been done. The lobster bisque was great, and we asked that they de-shell the lobsters for us, but by the time the food arrived the lobster was not good at all. It was very chewy and not appealing at all. We had ordered a surf & turf, the filet was just as bad.  We had a pretty big bill for our party of 4: I have no issue paying a premium for premium quality food, but from what I experienced, Red Lobster would have been a better choice for us. To make things worst, they did not really compensate us for the poor service and attitude the waiter gave us. I am not expecting  a free meal, but a well know and reputable establishment needs to do a better job to serve their patrons. Actually, they did give us a free gimlet, but at that point it was too little too late.",

However, the food wasn't up to par for me.  What I really wanted was the Prime Rib, but they didn't have any more left.  So, I settled for the Rib Eye.  I ordered it medium-rare as per the chef's recommendation, but it was unevenly cooked and most of It came out more on the rare side.  It was also one of the fattiest pieces of steak that I've ever had.  I also had the Lobster Bisque, which I thought was a bit too rich/smokey and have had better, but everyone else who had it loved it.  The jumbo shrimp cocktail was satisfactory.  That seemed to be the trend at our table.  Most of those who had lobster or some other type of seafood enjoyed their meals, while those of us who had steak were left unsatisfied.",

Our waiter was constantly MIA and when we did see him and we would ask for things that would never come (drink refills, missing order, fresh cracked pepper, dipping sauce).  We were so disparate that we had to flag down other waiters to get anything, including refills on water.  I ordered a glass of wine, which took a half hour to arrive and I had to ask about the status 3 times before receiving it.  It was a Saturday early afternoon and the lunch traffic was moderate, so I really can't understand why the service was so off.  We ordered a side dish for the table of cottage fries that never came, but we were still charged for it when our check arrived.  I'm totally bummed because I used to dine here often with fantastic experiences.",

None of this new Vegas bullshit. Its perfect.  Every time I come to town, I make special arrangements to eat there. I always know I am going to have a great meal with great service.   Last time I was there the waiter was a bit of a local history buff. We started dropping names of the old guard there, and everyone I knew or was family to he had a story about. It was great to see this sort of attention to knowing your home.  Can't recommend this place highly enough.",

The restaurant is not fancy and it is in a part of Caesars that looks like a mall.  The restaruant looks like a store front at a cheasy mall.  Very disappointing.  For the price, I would go to a fancier restaurant.  I was dressed up for a night on the town and was out of place at this bib-wearing cartoon pictures pasted on the wall restaurant.

    "text": "Located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  The restaurant motif is consistent with other Palm Restaurants.  The walls are decked out in hundreds of Caricatures of celebrities over the past fifty years.  The restaurant is generally pretty crowded so waits can be a while.  But consider that you're inside an amazing shopping mall so just take your 45 min wait and get some shopping done.  Lobster - I've tried the lobster on two different occasions.  They are monsters!  The first one was 5 1/2 lbs and the second was 6 lbs!!!  Both times, it was $23 per lb so do the math and it gets pretty steep.  If you get some sides (highly recommend the hashed browns), then you can split the lobster and be pretty stuffed.  Typically lobsters of this size are tough, chewy, with little flavor (the ideal size for texture anf flavor should be 1 1/2), but it was still great.  It's definitely more about the novelty of eating a lobster claw the size of your hand than it is about fine-dining.    The way the Lobster is cooked and served is split down the middle and broiled.  It's sprinkled lightly with parsley and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.  Its not the best Lobster I've had, but its definitely the biggest and most satisfying serving of lobster I've ever had.  Either way, its definitely something to try.  Filet Mignon - What a disappointment.  The first time around, it was bland, dry, and tough.  I specifically ordered Medium Rare and it was served medium to medium-well.  The second time I ordered it, again, it was bland, tough, and even MORE dry.  Granted the Filets are about 2 1/2 - 3 inches thick so its a little difficult to cook the steaks properly without charring the surface to hell.  Nevertheless, I was horribly disappointed on both occasions.    *Note - I tried the Bone-In Rib-Eye at the Los Angeles Location and it was a great steak.  Juicy, flavorful, and seared to perfection.  Perhaps the Filet Mignon is just the Achilles Heal of The Palm.",

Assuming the waiter didn't pocket $100 (which I don't think he did), which I don't really care about as we were a party of 12 and things go wrong when counting money, the waiter was friendly and attentive.    Moving on to the food:  (1) the bread was bad (you know a place is really bad when you can't even eat the bread).  (2) the heart of palm salad was incredibly bad: hearts of palm out of the can + 10 pieces of romaine + diced tomatoes + olives tasting of straight brine and not cured in olive oil + cheap feta crumbles (not the authentic good stuff) + vinegar = disgusting.  (3) the garlic mashed potatoes were decent (aka, bad for the price) (4) the creamed corn was corn drained out of a can with cream (5) the t-bone steak was undercooked and bleeding.   Peaking over to my neighbors: (1) the lobster bisque was bad (2) the chilean sea bas was literally a mound of sea bass literally covered in \"blackened fish seasoning\" out of a jar (3) etc, etc, etc.   That's some pretty bad food, for such a pricey place.  1 salad, 1 entree, 2 drinks = $140.00",

We were taken to our table in the front part of the restaurant at Caesars Forum Shops.  On the table was a birthday card with birthday confetti on the table.  We were extremely pleasantly surprised.  OK, on to the food.  We weren't hungry due to a late lunch. I had the Delmaestro salad, a smaller size, and it was fantastic.  The scallops appetizer was fantastic.  My wife had the Caesar Salad.  It was too heavy in dressing, especially after she had asked for a light dressing.  But, her crab cake appetizer was very good.  It's a great restaurant that is professionally run.  The entire staff is exceptional.  Every visit the service has been great.  We are more prone to write negative reviews than positive ones.

Well, we just wanted to say that you're the best and the realist server ever. Thanks for the dessert and dessert cocktail! Even if the food was bad, which is wasn't, we would come back just to hang with you. Where's that accent from, Chicago? Boston? You can tell us all about it next time we're eating at Palm in Vegas!   Your pals, yuri & annie   Ordered the ribeye / garlic mash / goat cheese mash / 2 glasses of the Russian river Pinot noir  10/10 on everything we ordered and didn't order! Seriously, the night before we had a ribeye at the Barrymore restaurant and it was complete garbage compared to the ribeye here. Highly recommend! We'll be back, thanks for the A+ service and food!",

Karlos was our server and all I have to say is he was amazing. Very attentive with service and the server assistant also was wonderful. Thanks for a great dinner. We will be back.",

The salad was perfectly balanced and dressed, the bread was amazing with a diverse selection. Drinks were awesome. Had lamb chops and linguini, both fresh, excellent, and perfectly cooked.

    "text": "The palms is the main reason why I flew 8 hours to go to Las Vegas. I celebrated my 21st birthday with my family (2 aunts and uncles, cousin, parents, boyfriend- party of 9) at the Palms restaurant. Let me first start by saying, this is the BEST restaurant in caesars palace by far. They have truly earned their 5 stars from me.   My birthday dinner was on a Friday night- but we couldn't help ourselves, we also stopped by Thursday night for some cocktails. My mom got a glass of sauvignon blanc- really good. My cousin got an espresso martini which was fantastic.On top of the martini, she ordered a shot of espresso as well. Now, she is a professional espresso drinker (if there is such a thing) and this espresso was impeccably delicious. You could tell that it was good espresso because the raw sugar stayed at the top then drizzled down in the cup. They served it with a lemon wedge and raw sugar on a stick (kind of looked like rock candy) and it was fantastic! The rest of my family got dirty martinis with blue cheese filled olives TO DIE FOR!! The best martini I have ever had. The measurements were all accurate (olive juice to vodka).   On Friday, it was the night of my birthday dinner. We were greeted wit such a delight-able and friendly staff. The staff went out of their way to make my birthday dinner as special as it could possibly be. They blocked off an entire room for my dinner with my family. The table was decked out in birthday decorations such as stars and confetti etc.  The appetizers: fried calamari (10/10) you could taste the octopus and the seasoning was delicious.   carpaccio of beef tenderloin-AMAZING and the only thing on the appetizer list that is not seafood and well worth trying. Take it from me! Bacon wrapped scallops: FRESH bacon wrapped in hot moist scallops. Perfect amount of saltiness. Baked clams casino: the BEST food on the menu. The clams were baked into the shell with seasoning. SOOOOOOOO GOOD I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.   The ceaser salad had fresh Parmesan cheese on top with crisp romaine lettuce. I got the salad with sardines which completed the meal. The sardines were so fresh and salty.  A few of us got the lobster, which was cooked to perfection. The rest got steaks. This restaurant is a steak house, so you can't go wrong with ordering one. They are known for their steaks.   They surprised me with chocolate cake and sang to me. It was a great experience. The chocolate cake was by far the best cake I ever had. The general manager came in the room afterwards and showed True professionalism by buying us all a round of espresso martini shots. He introduced himself to us and got familiar with my family. GREAT guy. Outstanding experience here at the Palm. They truly earned each 5 stars. Great job!!",

    "text": "To celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary we chose the Palm.  In the past the dinners have been exceptional  but not this time:It was a quiet night and we chose to be seated near the back where only one other table was occupied.  The waiter arrived took our drink and food order and disappeared.  But only disappeared from our table since he was more interested in the 10 top near by.  Our food was delivered by the back waiter and the head waiter never came back to check to see if we were happy with our meal.  If he had, we could have told him that my husband's MedWell bone in ribeye was under cooked on one side and over cooked on the other end.  I could have shared with him that the 6 lb lobster I ordered was still RAW in two areas.  We tried to get his attention to no avail.  Since my husband knows I hate to make a scene and since it was our anniversary he didn't want to spoil it any further.  We did see the waiter for the second time when he dropped the bill at our table.  We put the $450 cash in the folder and proceeded to leave.  His tip was the balance from $432...more than he deserved.  But he had the nerve to say, \"That's what you are leaving me old man?\"  My husband who works in the industry said he should think about his service.  We are excellent tippers 25- 40% and the could confirm that with Brian or Carlos.  This waiter ruined our 25th wedding anniversary dinner, embarrassed my husband, and my son was furious.  As we exited my son asked us to step out as we spoke with McKenzie.  He heard, \" I'm sorry.\"    When we returned home my husband called the restaurant and spoke at length with McKenzie.   McKenzie took down the information and promised us the F&B manager would call us the next day.  Guess what that call should have been received on April 16 and on April 29, 2014 and no phone call.   I can't tell you how disappointed we are.  We will only have one 25th wedding anniversary dinner and it was ruined by your staff and management.  I can't imagine why your management staff did not address the situation.I then wrote a detailed email to the corporate office and no response to date on June 10.  I called them and they said they never receive it even though I confirmed the email address.  I guess Palm Las Vegas has learned its lack of customer service from corporate.  While I'm sure there is nothing you can do at this late date, I wanted you to know of the failings of this restaurant .  Certainly not the quality of service I would expect from The Palm.",

I've dined at the Palm before both for lunch and dinner and service has always been great however this past Thursday, service was phenomenal.

The hostess Bracia greeted me with a smile and looked for a table that I could easily drive up to. She politely asked me what had occurred and we chatted about it. I told her that the cure was to keep the leg elevated and to continue shocking it by icing it then applying heat.   About 5 minutes later, she returned with ice and helped me iced it and I forgot to mentioned, she had already helped me elevate it.   Later the manager (didn't get the name) came by to table touch. He was also very empathetic and moved a small table to block the hallway near my foot to ensure nobody accidentally bumped into my leg, what a thoughtful gesture!",

    "text": "Awesome and accommodating waitstaff! Came here this past Saturday with a party of 5 for lunch. We were seated very quickly and exactly where we wanted - outside hotel area. The warriors game was playing and so was a gold came at the bar. I asked our waiter to have them play the warriors game on the screen closer to us and he made it happen right away. So nice - thank you!  Reservations can be easily made on open table and their bread basket is amazing! Either I was really hungry and couldn't wait for my food to come... Or it was really that yummy. The rest of the table agreed, as well. For lunch, I had the lobster bisque (not salty enough but still very tasty) and they created me their own veggie sandwich even though it wasn't on the menu  I loved all of the grilled veggies and tons of avocado. Highly recommend this item!  Only thing I wouldn't order would be the Bloody Mary.. It was pretty water downed but other than that, awesome lunch place!",

They divided it in the kitchen but the plating and presentation was poor. The overall quality of the meat was average. I was very disappointed especially for the price - with the high number of great dinning options in Las Vegas I will go elsewhere. Mon Ami Gabi was significantly better and the staff was more friendly and attentive.",

An older gentleman who was less than friendly greeted us and was disappointed we didn't order alcohol  He also spit on my arm, and when I asked about the soup, he said \"is that all you want?\" He was so rude I insisted on a new waiter, which a new server replaced.  We ordered soups, clams arabiatta which was incredible, linguine n clam sauce and the lamb chops.  I ordered a special mixed drink with mint or basil which was awesome. Gin I believe.  Aside from that hideous initial server, the new one was great.  Definitely will return for those stuffed clams !",

    "text": "Based on the food alone, I would give this place 5 stars. Everything we had was prepared perfectly. We had a good sized party and absolutely everyone was thrilled with their food.  The service was okay, but unremarkable. Definitely had better service at some other high end steak houses, but it certainly wasn't bad.  The big problem with the Palm is the ambiance and the space. They literally cram as many people as possible in there. You get absolutely no room whatsoever as other diners and staff are totally on top of you. Additionally, the acoustics are horrible and the sound just bounces all over the place. As a result of that, and all the people they pack in there, the Palm is one of the loudest restaurants I have ever eaten at. Good luck holding a conversation with someone.  Despite how good the food is, I doubt I will be back unless they move to a bigger space with more room and better acoustics. Las Vegas just has way too many good restaurants to bother going to a place this loud and cramped.",

    "text": "First world problem: Oh no! My filet mignon is too tough and lacks any depth in flavor. (Silently pouts)  Trying not to be a typical LA food snob, but it's hard not to when you're dropping serious money and expecting at least a 9 out of 10 foodie experience but instead you're getting a 3.  We get to the palms at 7 pm and check out their menu outside their restaurant.  We walk into a mostly empty restaurant and we're escorted to a booth in the back. Along the way, I notice a lot of celebrity caricatures lined the walls and above their bar which suggests to me that a lot of celebrities come here to eat. So I think we should be in for a treat.  For the appetizer we ordered fried calamaris.  And for our main entree, I ordered a 14 oz medium rare filet mignon with creamed spinach.  My wife ordered a sauteed Chilean sea bass.  First, the assortment of cold bread comes out. I know I don't go there for the bread but not having warm bread on the table as the first thing is a little off putting. The least the Palms can do is pretend it's fresh by nuking it in the microwave.  Our fried calamaris came out on a huge plate and could have easily fed at least four or five people. We were hungry so we dove in. The calamaris itself was properly fried and not too oily and the tomato sauce had a good tartness to it. However, after a few pieces we kept finding fried bell peppers mixed in with the calamaris. Since the bell peppers were thinly cut, breaded, and fried they looked like a tentacle. Maybe the chef didn't feel the need to use a clean mixing bowl when breading the calamaris but that resulted in bell pepper booby traps laced across the dish.  My filet mignon and creamed spinach arrive and the caveman in me was craving for some bloody meat. The thick filet mignon was seared nicely but when I took a bite, the texture wasn't very tender and tougher than expected for dry aged beef. Additionally, the meat was completely void of any flavor which calls into question their minimum 35 dry aging process. I was expecting stronger beefy flavor notes from the ageing but all I tasted was the age.  The creamed spinach was okay but I was so supremely disappointed with the meat that I lacked the appetite to finish the sad slab of meat.  As for the chillian sea bass, it was easily the largest cut I've seen at a restaurant. The added benefit of chillian sea bass is that you don't need to do much and this fish should still stands on its own.  However, when my wife took a bite, the sad puppy dog eyes on her face said it all. The sea bass was perfectly cooked but the only flavor this had was from the mild salt of the waters it was caught from. It's True that you don't need to do much for this fish, but you can't just pull it out of the sea and add zero seasoning to it either. However we are partly to blame for this disaster because we broke the sacred rule to never order seafood at a steakhouse.   Our server noticed our dissatisfaction and did refund the creamed spinach and calamaris. But at the end of the day, I still dropped more than $100 on an uninspired dinner that still left me hungry/hangry when we left.   Clearly this place attempts to pass itself off as a legit steakhouse but like it's characatures on its walls, what they feature was greatly exaggerated.",

    "text": "Perhaps my expectations were higher than they should be given the solid overall 4 stars on Yelp and the fact that the host of the evening raved about this (and took us away from a different casino with ample steakhouse choices to come here). I wasn't overwhelmed, but wasn't underwhelmed either - would leave it as an A-OK. The service was fine, but as the only female at a table with 6 other men, I would have expected that they would have served me first from a manners perspective, and that wasn't the case (the waitress took my salad order and then moved on, and left the table before realizing that she hadn't taken my entree order as she had everyone else's). I started with the Iceberg Lettuce Wedge (Danish blue cheese, toasted walnuts, bacon, cherry tomatoes, chives and fried onions - although I asked them to go light on the bacon). This was a good wedge and I went for the slightly smaller option, which was plenty. As my main, I had the 9 ounce Filet Mignon, cooked medium. It was cooked to perfection and the steak was certainly tasty. For the family style sides, I tried the Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes and I do love me some goat cheese, which you could taste in the potatoes, but I think they needed a bit more whipping as they were lumpy. For dessert, we shared the doughnuts in a bag (and they do come to the table in a bag) and they were just OK. The wines we had were both great. All in all, it was a good evening (and one I wasn't paying for), however, I expect a bit more consistency at these types of prices at a restaurant, so that's why I'm giving it a solid 3-star rating.",

    "text": "My dining experience here was exceptionally awful.*  My friends and I originally had reservations at Craftsteak for my birthday dinner, which we drunkenly changed to the Palm in order to merge with another group of friends who were also celebrating a birthday. Bad move on my part--and thankfully the only shitty thing I did this Vegas trip--but one star to the Palm for accommodating our last minute 18-person reservation (I should've taken a hint from the fact that this restaurant wasn't packed to capacity.)...  Welp, that's about where the pros end. Our food wasn't served until OVER AN HOUR after we had ordered. Unbelievable. The filet mignon I ordered 'medium' was overdone and flavorless, and our waiter did not come by once to ask how anything was. The three cheese potatoes au gratin were good, but not worth writing home about. My boyfriend had no complaints about his chicken parm, but he is easily pleased, hence why we've been together for so long *ba dap ch*.  There was also a whole ordeal with splitting the check. You'd think an \"upscale\" restaurant like this would have an efficient, hassle-free way of doing this, but nope. That debacle added even more time to our almost 2.5 hour dining fiasco.  *OVERALL: huge waste of time and money.  The highlight of any dining experience, IMHO, should be the food or the service and the Palm lacked in both. Weirdly enough, the highlight of my evening were the girls who were so unbearably cold during our long wait for food that they wore borrowed chef coats and didn't mind looking like they were in straight jackets. :)",

My fav is West Hollywood because it pretty much became my home.  I did try San Diego but was disappointed...and then the manager emailed me and it was all good (tho I haven't been back so far I would go for the new piano bar to check it out).  So now...here is the Palm Las Vegas experience...LOVE it!  I'm not one to sit and continue to rant about one location not having the charm of another one...they are \"same~same but different\".    At any rate, for a family dinner (grandma, grandpa, mom, dad and brother) we headed out to the Palm.  Mom and brobro ordered the Oscar...steak with crab and a bernaise sauce...pure heaven...as in tears to my eyes heaven.  My brobro saw them put it down in front  of mom and his mouth watered.  I ask you...who cares what everyone else ordered...the Oscar was the best dinner ever! Perfectly cooked filet mignon steak that melted in your mouth with a ton of crab on top...a brilliant surf and turf!!!  Cheese potatoes that may have taken one year off dad's life, asparagus with garlic and oil...delicious!  Okay okay..now what did  everyone else have?  Grandpa got the salmon (huge piece of salmon and really delightful) Grandma got the crab legs ~ huge!!! Dad and I shared the...now let's say it together because it's my favorite ~ the veal parm!  Awesome as always!  Our waiter was charming and fun - a really wonderful server who earned his $$$$ that night.  Lively atmosphere, very busy...highly recommend heading there.  It really retains the charm of and quality of the Palm family.  I took off one star for a simple reason...in West Hollywood there is a manager who walks around to your table and treats you like you're part of the family.  He's wearing a suit, he has a smile...flirts with the ladies and makes the men feel like their kings.  It makes a huge difference..that's what I call service!  They also have the wine guy (I know what they are called but can't spell it...sommilier...???) who comes over to talk to you about wine...it's  just a great feeling...takes two minutes (if that) and really makes you feel good!  That's what Vegas needs..I mean come  on...it's Vegas..that's what it's all about!  Make us feel like high rollers...we just spent $500 bucks on dinner and want to feel like we own the world!",

We also had the 3 cheese potatos which were fanatastic.  One major problem came at the end of the night.  We were walking out of the restaurant when the manager came over to us and said we were short on the bill.  We went back to check how much we had left and noticed that a $100 dollar bill was missing.  There were several of us that all saw the $100 go into the check presenter yet the waiter said that there was never one in there.  After being forced out of another hundred that we did not owe, I will never go back to this restaurant.",

Even though this restaurant was in the Forum shops, the restaurant did not feel very commercial like some restaurants that are in mall food courts.  Our server gave us perfect service. Great recommendations and genuinely nice.  Many of us ordered the Lobster and Filet Mignon combo. Great deal especially since they crack all of your lobster shells for you. I think it was a lot of food though. I think two people can eat the half lobster and filet.  A friend also ordered the rib eye and it tasted great.  Service was timely considering we had a large party.  Dessert was a large platter of cakes galore. I think we were about to blow up.  Overall, we would definitely come back here, even though they are so many other very good restaurants in Vegas.  You get good portions, the food is great and the service is great. I think this restaurant is one of the best values in Vegas",

We ordered lobster, filet mignon, three chesse au gratin potatoes, and a caesar salad.   While the salad was ordinary (a little underwhelming frankly), the rest of the food was most definitely extraordinary!  Simply superb taste and texture.  Three special comments about the service as well:  They tied bibs on us in case the lobster got messy and butter went a-flyin'.  Both of our waiters, using cloth napkins, broken open the claws of our lobster and pulled the meat out for us.  After dinner, they squeezed fresh lemon juice into our hands and then provided warm, wet tablecloths for us to dry our hands with.  We left smelling lemony fresh!  This place, though very pricey, will not disappoint.  We chose to sit on the patio and people watch.  A great evening!",

They have an unbelievable lunch menu.  For about $25 you can have an excellent three course meal.   You must order the half and half with your meal.  They were great fried onions and potatoes on the side.  Service was also very good.  Overall, one of the best values in terms of quality of food, service, atmosphere, and price in Las Vegas that I have seen.",

    "text": "My first time to any Palm restaurant. It was expensive, like any steakhouse, but I enjoyed it.  Our server (Karles? Not sure of the name) was very, very good. Took his time explaining the menu and the history of the restaurant but never lingered too long. Staff in general was very attentive and worked hard.  My girlfriend and I split the 14oz Filet Mignon. Her half seemed a more True medium rare than mine which was slightly overcooked. I have had better steaks, I have had worse. Overall, pretty decent, but you will pay for it. Like I said, her half was much tastier than mine, not sure how that was possible...  Ordered three sides: Three cheese potatoes were the best and asparagus was the worst. Very bland and dry...very disappointing since I love asparagus. Almost said something...it was really bad.  Debated between 3 or 4 stars. Chose 4 stars but just barely...good service and a good night with friends won out over the high prices and sometimes mediocre food. For the record, my friends ordered different meals and were very happy with their choices. The New York Strip is their specialty so maybe I should have ordered that instead.",

The food is solid and the service is impeccable, and that doesn't seem to vary from location to location the way it does in some places.The filet mignon is melt in your mouth good ( if they have a bone -in filet mignon spend the extra bucks- its worth it ) Most of the stuff is standard steak house stuff with a few Italian options to boot. The sides are family style and  more than enough for 2 people. Haven't had too many desserts here usually too stuffed, but the chocolate cake is to die for good.",

I'm a BIG bone-in Rib Eye fan... requested at Medium-Rare+... in parts the steak was, but overall it was not even rare, it was blue. The temperature was off too. Their hash-browns were good, but anything with that much butter is going to taste good. Compared to places like Osteria Mozza in LA, this Rib Eye was a \"C\" at best. A lot better places to spend your money in Vegas than what is now a typical chain restaurant.",

We were going to take advantage of early specials on appetizers advertised online and then have dinner.  When we sat down, we were told that the specials were only served in the bar.  Okay, I'll go along with that.  Most expensive beer pints in the world.  Drinks were very good.  Appetizers were good.  We should have stopped there.  Dinner was served by a very energetic waiter...and his son.  Very pleasant, close to annoying.  Service was consistent and outstanding throughout the evening.  Main courses for steak were tasty, but way over priced.  Avoid the veal, it was dreadful, worse I ever had.  Dry, pounded gray substance of some sort.  I guess it was meant to be that way.  Look else where unless they have a good advertised steak special which they did the previous month.",

The rosemary and duck fat fried fingerlings were equally tasteless. Mushrooms same. I was shocked. I'm not used to having to salt and pepper my steak, especially at these prices.

We were a bit early for our 8pm reservation and while they were very busy, we were promptly seated in the most comfortable booth. We had an entire team of servers who were well above expectations!! They were all very kind, knowledgeable about the menu, efficient, provided great suggestions, but never intrusive. The cocktails were delicious, but the food, oh man, the food was unbelievable!! We started with a colossal lump crabmeat cocktail and bacon-wrapped sea scallops. The fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce on the crab and the perfectly crisped bacon, so good!! We then split an 18oz NY strip and their 3lb lobster special of the evening. I love lobster and that was the best one I've ever eaten! One of the servers even cracks the claw for you!! The steak couldn't have been cooked any more perfectly and was seasoned just right. Paired with the wild mushrooms and Brussels sprouts, it was incredible!! We probably would've spent a third hour here to settle in for dessert had we not had a show to go to. This is a definite must go if you love a classic experience that never fails, a foodie's dream!",

Most friendly way staff ever, great food, and I cannot believe the price of the amazing lobster deal here-not to mention you are in Vegas and Caesar's Palace, where you expect to pay an arm and a leg and here you are with the best deal ever!  Did I mention how ridiculously tasty the lobster is grilled, cracked in half, succulent and fresh?  And did I mention it's claw is bigger than my hands?  And the claw meat is oh so amazingly tasty?  Look forward to coming back and having lobster again, I think I'm I have to make this a regular stop from now on.",

I had a side salad, their famous chicken parm (absolutely delicious) that doesn't come with pasta, cheesy potatoes, green beans, cheese cake, and lemon aid and my total was around 115 bucks. Gratuity included. So you can see what I'm saying about the prices. But I'm glad I went. If you have money to blow, stop in. Maybe get a steak though to make it worth wild. A great touch was the manager stopping by to great us and say hello!",

Adriana was my contact person. Anytime I had a question, a comment, or a concern all I had to do was email her and she would get back to me ASAP. There was never a moment when I was stressed or unsure about the process of doing a dinner party at this location. The day of my birthday was amazing! Everything came out and orders were taken as they should be. The wait staff introduce themselves and worked well together to get my party of 14 people in and out in two hours. It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely come back for a solo dinner or for another celebration. I highly recommend this venue for a date night, a meeting, a family event, a wedding reception, or even a 40th birthday party. In addition to that the manager came in and introduced himself to me and he also gave me a business card so that I could contact him if I had any issues. This was the best service I could have imagined and a stress free situation.",

Starter salads and soups were fresh but nothing crazy. I got the salmon, it was good but not much taste to it. He got the steak, which presentation wise didn't look too appealing. It was just tousled with crunchy onion toppings, no sauces on the side or on it.  It was really sad and dry looking. Ordered medium, came out medium well for sure, was tough and not a good piece of steak. I even had a bite just to make sure :/ I know The Palm has a good reputation, and have even been to other locations, however this one was not one I will rush back to even as locals.",

No you don't have to be a businessman or woman to enjoy it! :)  Here's a Snap shot of the \"Business Lunch\" offering: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=v4-qsEd_pRl2IBtmxvH-wg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  FOOD: 3.5/5 stars  +Assortment of Bread: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=WChTczTAlWHiukaXECsK2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  +Caesar Salad: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=WmHUl_yzQBNKW1p-f5wv8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  +1/2 and 1/2 (shoe string potatoes and potato chips: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=HxYQB5W4zL-uObpJc8VG5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  +10 oz angus aged steak with mashed potatoes and brandy peppercorn sauce: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=sIR5w4Hk4jSLCnlHNmNl2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  +Key Lime Pie:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x7UBSSRsdbp3ZqguG3Q?select=ZbdyHkLH8js1dR1wCwGMxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/w12x...</a>  Overall, the food was pretty good.  The highlight definitely was the steak with the peppercorn brandy sauce.  It was not the best steak I've ever had but it definitely had a nice age and flavor to it.  Definitely lots of value for your $25.95 lunch price tag.  Everything else was pretty standard, nothing that really blew my mind.   PRICE: 4/5 stars  For $25.95, you will get full.  Sure this is vegas and you could get much more out of a $5.99 steak and eggs but we're talking about a nice steak at a steakhouse.  Compared to other steakhouse prices, there is definitely value to be had here.  VARIETY: 3/5 stars  It's a steakhouse! Palm has meat for days.  There are seafood choices if someone in your party feels like indulging in something other than steak.   SERVICE: 3/5 stars  Waiters were dressed formally and the service was good..  When the waiters congregated and chatted (quite loudly) in the dining room, it took away from the ambiance of the restaurant.  INTANGIBLES: 3/5 stars  I've never seen so many cartooned framed pictures of celebrities.  It's kind of cool to look around the restaurant at the pictures.  Besides that, it seems like quite your typical dark wood furniture steak house.  Good lunch at a nice price and we left happy. :) I definitely think the Business Lunch has great value if you were in the area and wanting steak for a reasonable price.",

    "text": "If your taste for great food can be influenced by one particular restaurant then the Palm is it for me. I have been eating at this gastronomic icon before I was even an adult. I've eaten at the Palm in most major cities and had the most magical dinner at the original in NYC. What a great place to start to form a love for incredible food.   Unfortunately, like the mall it's in, it's a glitzy place with no substance (sorry, Caesers).   A friend and I walked in right on time for our reservation and were made to wait after we declined to sit at the bar (the hostess tried to convince us that eating in the bar was an option for reservations even though there were many empty tables - rude). Finally we got a table and from then on the experience got a bit better.   Service here is impeccable. Our water glasses stayed filled, plates were taken away, everyone was very polite and efficient. That is the best part of this restaurant.  The bread basket was delicious, it has several different kinds served with butter. We each ordered steak, that is why we came. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my friend ordered the filet mignon. We also ordered three sides: mushrooms, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  I usually love sides, I think they can be an incredible accompaniment, but these were so bad we didn't even touch them.   The mushrooms were clearly soaked in vinegar. The sharp acrid taste was so overwhelming that the taste of mushrooms was clearly lost. The mashed potatoes had goat cheese mixed in, which I'm not a fan of, but the potatoes were fluffy. I just can't eat goat cheese. Blech. The creamed spinach was overwhelmingly creamy, almost too thin to eat with a fork. The taste was bland as though they had added too much tasteless cream. The spinach taste was also lost.  I ordered my ribeye medium rare and it came out so rare that if it had been cooked any less it would have been raw. The meat was stringy and so fatty that I almost gagged. I ate a few bites and then asked for it to go. What? My dogs love undercooked, overfatty meat!  My friends filet was good, but I refused to taste it. After all this bad food my stomach was starting to hurt. Ugh.   I'm extremely disappointed in the food at this restaurant. It was my first bad experience with the Palm, EVER (in 28 years). I would never go back here. Not for free, not for pay, never.",

He dropped a steak knife on my foot and did not bother to apologize, even though the knife clearly hit me. The hearts of palm salad (which, for some reason, is not listed on the menu) is really delicious. The wedge salad is a clusterf*ck that somehow includes walnuts and a ton of fried onions.  My friend and I each ordered a filet. His came out perfect, while mine came out covered in a layer of grease that I was actually able to pour off the top onto my plate. We ordered the brussel sprouts and the half fries, half onion strings as sides and both were mediocre. My friend likes this place, so it's possible I'll be back, but rest assured, there will be some kicking and screaming along the way from my end to get there.",

    "text": "The \"surf and turf\" is the dish to order here. You can have one order for two so my coworker and I ordered a 6-lb lobster and we each had an 8-oz filet mignon. Their lobsters were from Nova Scotia and tasted great without needing any seasoning or butter. The half lobster on my plate also came with some browned lobster \"liver\" and that was the first for me and I ate it all. My filet was cooked perfectly to my preference: medium rare and it was tender and juicy inside and seared brown outside.  For desserts we had New York cheesecake (rich creamy and slightly tangy), flourless chocolate cake (dark chocolate & creamy) and creme brulee; everything was fantastic. The restaurant is located in the Ceaser's Palace Hotel right at the entrance of the \"Forums\" so you can do some window shopping afterwards at some of those expensive designer brands clothing shops.",

    "text": "Chose to make a surf and turn out of the special bone-in filet mignon and a half of a 3 lb lobster. The steak was great but I'm not sure what the advantage of the \"bone-in\" feature was. The lobster was good and the attendant who took it apart for me did a great job. I'd never been to a place that provides that service. Made the bib kinda pointless. My wife had the tuna which was good but the layer of peppercorns over the top was a little overwhelming. We also had the calamari appetizer, which was big enough for 4 people.  I tried a signature drink called the \"Seasonal Mule\" (Grey Goose Vodka, ginger beer, hand-squeezed lemon and lime juice, Angostura Bitters, served on the rocks.) DO NOT get this drink, it tastes like how a urinal cake in a public bathroom smells. Luckily the waitress took it off the bill and gave me a vodka/tonic instead.  Our waitress was overbearing. Friendly, but barely gave us a chance to breathe with renovation stories and opportunities to join the rewards club and blah blah blah with too many visits to the table. I could've used a bit more space to enjoy the date with my wife.  Other than that, it was great.",

    "text": "Had a very disappointing dinner at the Palm last night. Our party of four stopped in early, around 5:30 PM , and got seated right away.  After browsing the menu, two of us opted to split the surf and turf and a salad, I chose the grilled salmon with a mango salsa and my daughter chose the filet mignon.  When our meal was served, my salmon was so dry that I had to send it back. I commented to our server that I prefer it medium rare.  When she returned with the new dish, it still was very overcooked. Because the other members in our party we're already halfway through their meals, I did not send it back to the kitchen again. For $38 though, The chef should be able to cook a piece of simple fish correctly.  The two people in our party who split the surf and turf asked to have their steak cooked medium and it came out well done instead. Again, for the high prices that they charge, you would expect your meat to come out as ordered, especially when the restaurant was practically empty because we dined so early. The only positives to our meal were the cocktails and our friendly and personable server.  The food was extremely overpriced and very mediocre quality-wise.  $300 later, we were very disappointed...",

If you have never been here the lunch special is probably the best deal that exists. They recently must have slightly modified the offer it doesn't include the dessert any more but it's still a good deal. I had the swordfish which was perfect. It came with split pea soup one of my favorites and as good as it gets. They give you homemade bread as well to nibble on. You also get a side item. Had the green beans also perfect. I realize why they cut the dessert no one can eat all this. The price is great at slightly over $20.",

Imagine me saying the next passage in a Liam Neeson \"Taken\" kind of voice: \"Sit at the bar.  Look the bartender in the eye. Only order 4 plates for 2 people.  You will be full.  And if your spoon is missing, take off your belt, snap it in half and fold it like a New York City pizza to scoop up the rest of your food.\"  We got the following:  Charcuterie Plate: calabrian salami, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano, danish blue & pepper relish.  This was a pretty substantial amount of cheese and cold cuts.  Great with some wine.    Mini Broiled Crabcakes: (3) chipotle tartar sauce.  These were just OK.  I would've preferred just one large crabcake.  No need for the cracked on the bottom of each piece of crab.  The homemade potato chips were a nice touch.    Chicken Parmigiana Sliders: Nice little fried bits of chicken in a bun.  Can't possible hate on this.      Nova Scotia Lobster BLT Sliders: lobster salad, applewood smoked bacon, oven dried tomatoes, avocado and micro greens.  The best dish we had.  I would order a double of this next time.     This would be a clear cut choice for a 5 star happy hour ONLY IF they actually offered a discount on beverages!  Palm, couldn't you even entertain the idea of $2 off a drink?  $13 martinis at 4:30pm seems kinda crazy.",

The great part about Vegas is that you can try these places in casual clothes if you feel like it. Well, I felt like it. This is really a 3.5  Yelp Tip: If you check in, you get a $15 off $100 at dinner.   I was here for lunch, so maybe next time. BUT here's another tip. They have a 3 course lunch menu for only $29. It's such a steal. I chose the lentil soup which was super flavorful. I've never had a lentil soup this good.   For my entree, I got the steak salad. There's a lot of steak on it - flavorful, perfectly cooked steak. You'd probably need to eat only half. They also give you a TON of lettuce, palm, etc. with a great vinaigrette.    For dessert, the server told us that we could get cheesecake, in addition to the key lime and flourless chocolate cake shown on the menu. She didn't need to say anymore. The cheesecake was fantastic. It's definitely New York cheesecake - HUGE piece (again, you probably only need half of it), dense and creamy at the same time, topped with strawberry sauce. It was really worth the calories.   I liked this place and loved that we could sit on the \"patio\" cuz you know it's really inside of Caesars' Forum shops, and totally people watch. Super plus is the server. She was perfectly chatty and friendly.",

    "text": "The Palm Restaurant in Las Vegas is expensive, but worth it. The salmon was incredible, and at the time that we went to Vegas I was into eating salmon frequently, and the one served at the Palm has turned out to be the best I have ever had. We live on the east coast, near the water, and seafood is readily available, but I still remember that meal as having been the best.   The atmosphere is like most steakhouses, with perfectly lacquered hard wood everywhere, and a fine dining feel the moment you walk in. As a family of four, we felt it was a little bit much to spend, but when you are in Vegas, you are there for the whole experience, so don't hold back. Enjoy and spend a little.  This is definitely a great place to do that.",

Food took an hour and ten minutes to be delivered after we complained to waiter, then manager apologized and said seat was because food had to be redone as it was not up to his standards.  That said, we had to send 3 steaks back as 2 undercooked and 1 cold. I got the bone in ribeye and it was very unmemoriable.  We spoke to manager and he comped some food and wine, but all in all a big disappointment for what was supposed to be a memorable night out with friends.",

Thank you, Palm, for providing the worst dining experience I have experienced in Las Vegas.    Ever.  From the pompus, rude 'gentleman' at the host desk (thank you for turning your back on my mom while she was asking you a question - way to make the guests feel special!) to the rushed and perfunctory service from our waiter you have more than assured me that I will never again set foot in this establishment.  The highlights included:  - The most indifferent and rude 'greeting' from the excuse of a person at the host stand. Yes, Mr. Personality, I DO have a reservation. - No greeting from our waiter - he merely opened his notebook and asked what we wanted.  Were there specials? Anything we should be aware of on the menu? We will never know. - The waiter bringing me the wrong wine selection twice and then arguing with me about what I actually ordered.  I had to show him both the name and number on the wine list - twice.  I did eventually receive what I requested - a small miracle. - The same waiter slamming down our shrimp cocktail (presented slapped on a bed of lettuce rather than in the standard iced bowl, with only four on the plate rather than the usual five) and salads (a three year old could have made these look better) at the same time on the table while mumbling that they were 'busy'. - I had to ask for water, bread and yes, even a FORK. - Lobster should not be served partially raw.  No.  I could go on, but writing this just makes me annoyed all over again.",

Btw, I love food and when I can pair it with the perfect glass of wine- well that's my heaven on earth experience. The service here at the Palm made me feel like royalty. The pretzel roll sprinkled with salt and a touch of butter was salivating my palate with that savory salty taste and butter- what a treat! They even offered more but I didn't need more carbs. I ordered the filet with sauteed spinach. It was so nice to enjoy a slow dining experience enjoying every small bite of red meat with a light pink center. A small bite of filet and a small sip of Cabernet. No need to talk or rush just savor each bite. I love spinach and it even had a few garlic cloves - I had to finish it all - sorry honey. I love garlic too. Enough ranting about my wonderful Vegas dining experience as I was feeling spoiled rotten and just enjoyed the moment.  One thing they could improve is the wine by the glass menu- not many Cabernets were offered by the glass - so I settled on Chateau St. Michele Cabernet.  FYI- there is wine bar in the Ceasar's Palace that offers Caymus by the glass. It's above my budget and Caymus is on of my favorites if you want to splurge on a good glass of cab.",

    "text": "A group of 20+ family members and friends have been traveling to Las Vegas every year now for 15+ years.  Every Saturday night of this weekend trip, always involves a visit to a great steak house somewhere in Las Vegas (either on or off the strip).  Sometimes we go to the same steakhouse two years in a row (eg. Maestros, Del Frisco's, etc) because the food and service are exceptional.  This year, we chose the The Palm Las Vegas.  After hearing great things and setting expectations really high, they came up a bit short.   Our bill was well north of $2,000.  But its not about amount of the bill, as much as its about the expectations we had going in.  We were expecting gold level service and unfortunately, we left feeling like our business wasn't valued.  Three members of our party were not satisfied with their main entree (either under cooked or over cooked vs. what they had requested).  When the manager came over, all he said was, \"Do you want another dish?\" To me that was the wrong answer.  We had been there for several hours already after ordering drinks, appetizers and salads.  These members of our party didn't want to wait another 10-20 minutes for another entree while the rest of our party continued to eat.  Their meals should have been delivered to them the right way the first time.   My only expectation at this point would be for the manager to take those three entrees off the bill. Alas, he did not, he just walked away.  To me, that response is amateur hour and not that of someone who's supposed to be running a first class dining establishment. I sent a note to the restaurant and I received an automated response saying I would hear back from someone shortly.    After speaking with Michael Martin, the GM, he assured me that our experience was not the norm.  Based on our conversation, I would be willing to give them a second chance to make things right.",

    "text": "Expensive food with average food quality. It looks very classy but upscale but the food turns out to be just...okay. It's definitely not worth the cost if you want to eat at a place like this but I definitely do enjoy that it's in the mall when you want to take a break and eat semi-boujee.  Price: Expensive. It comes with a place like this and you know beforehand. I don't think it's exactly worth as the food isn't really compelling once presented. Other top tier steakhouses usually have a twist to the food that allows the savoriness or texture to compliment the dishes super well. This place doesn't really have much of that but charges around the same amount.  Service: Pretty good, a lot of places like this usually have good waiters/waitresses and this wasn't an exception. Waiter was nice and friendly and would speak to us when serving us, but that's about it.  Food: Pretty bland. Very typical from the same food. I hate to say it but it is what it is. I wish there was something that diversified it's dishes from the rest but like I said it's just typical. It's not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to lower tier prices/restaurants but when it comes to upscale places like this, I always want to see something different or unique that makes these places memorable, not typical.  Only wouldn't come back simply due to the food being average.",

We visited Caesar's Palace and the Forum shops and came across a nice looking restaurant called The Palm which served a variety of items including salads. Since we had plans to go out that night for dinner to celebrate my birthday we wanted something that wouldn't be too filling! Our amazing waiter, AJ, recommended the Lobster salad and said it was his favorite so we ordered one to share! WOW!! The most amazing lobster salad EVER with so much lobster , we couldn't believe our eyes!! AJ told us the Palm imports Nova Scotian lobster fresh every day and that theses lobsters are typically 3-5 lbs in Weight!! He even brought a lobster out to show us!! Amazing food! Amazing service and he surprised us with the most delicious creme brulee for dessert to celebrate my birthday!! The Palm is on the top of our list to visit on our next trip to Vegas!!",

We had sea bass (hubby says it was buttery), salmon, fried calamari (comes with peppers and fried lemons), hash browns (you have to get them), green beans, Capri salad (lots of basil) and a plain house type salad.    There was way too much food for us to eat and we were on a schedule because we had tickets to see Celine. We brought the leftovers home and I heated up the hash browns for breakfast and then I heated the green beans for dinner to enjoy with bratwurst.  I almost forgot to mention the bread basket.

Realizing that we meant business, our dining table was expanded on all four sides to afford more room for food for my party of four.  Then we were presented with a nice Bread Basket but Pretzel Bread was hard and the Rye Bread was not warm.  I enjoyed Torino Breadsticks dipped in butter, and a Classic Caesar Salad with requested anchovies that contained nice crisp croutons.  Meanwhile, Diane liked her Lobster Bisque, for she noted that it did not have a lingering liquor taste to it.  Then the two of us settled in to split a giant, fairly sweet 5-lb. lobster, while our guests did likewise.  As sides, Au Gratin Potatoes were suitably cheesy, and grilled Brussel Sprouts were very good.  So was the service.  I was disappointed though to hear that my Club 837 membership had expired when I submitted it for the recording of earned points.  I felt that I should have been notified about this by the corporate office before this occurred.  Nevertheless, I will certainly be back to dine here again!  XXXX-1/2 overall!",

We ordered oysters, and we think it was just an off night for them. As a bit of aficionados, we are finicky, to be fair. We has shishito  peppers that followed and they were excellent. Garlic aioli and parmigiana Regino. The Caesar and watermelon burrata salads were very good as well. The main corses steak and lobster were perfectly prepared. Small sides were more than enough.

The host presented a birthday card and we were escorted to a comfortable banquette midway between the the front and rear of the dining room.  The recently renovated restaurant has wall art that consists of caricature paintings of many celebrities. It makes for interesting conversation. The dining room has a variety of seating options, tables  in the center of the room, booths and banquettes along the walls. There are also table outside on the patio which are in the Forum shopping promenade. The patio seating is a choice if you prefer people watching. The dining room is open to the bar area with viewing of the 3 large screen TV's from most seats. If you prefer not to view the TV's. request a booth towards the back of the dining room.   Immediately after being seated were asked for our choice of water and the bread basket  arrived. There were several choices of bread along with butter and the requested containers of olive oil and balsamic. In celebration of the birthday our table was sprinkled with multi color stars.   The appetizer was the Baked Clams Casino. A flavorful dish with 8 clams topped with crispy bacon in a nice butter garlic sauce.   Our entrees were the 9 ounce Filet Mignon and the Atlantic Wild Halibut. The meals are a la carte. The sides were the Half and Half Potatoes and Grilled Asparagus and can be ordered family style, for 2 or more or an individual portion.   The Filet was cooked as requested and was an ample portion. The Half and Half potatoes was an enormous individual portion that would satisfy 4 people. The order is a mix of crispy cottage fries and fried onions. The Atlantic Wild Halibut was served on a bed of kale with garlic and lemon. The fish was flaky and mild. The grilled Asparagus was lightly charred and  al dente.

Just like a mirage, there was the Palm.  It was about 10 pm and we were immediately seated in a large booth.  We were also quickly greeted by our server and bus boy.  Who introduced themselves and picked up on our vibe and brought over waters and bread and Butta.    Nice Steakhouse menu, I liked seeing the 14 oz fillet.  I went for that and the creamed spinach.  The dishes came out quickly and were wonderful.  The fillet was cooked perfectly, and the creamed spinach was naughty AF.  Like all cream and fluffy and stood up and just che bella.   My Girly went for the Rib eye, which was smart cuz it was delicious and after a bite reminded me why rib eye is so divine.  The last steak I had in vegas at BLT was really lousy and the Palm was far better.    Plus our server, was excellent, attentive, genuine, and pickin up what we were putting down.  I slept really good after 14 oz of meat. Well done!",

Lobster was perfect as was the 12 oz fillet.   Server didn't come to the table for 10 minutes and we asked someone else to help us. Our server didn't realize we were in her area. Otherwise, she was fine yet the overall service experience felt a bit weak given the outstanding food.

She jumped through a couple of hoops tonight without even asking. She deserves more than a 5 star we need to start giving out 10 STARS to the ones who are most wonderful like Tay!!!  I had impeccable food.. started with Small Lobster (since they were sold out of the big ones) then came the pasta and delicious chicken parmigiana, followed by sides: creamy spinach, mash potatoes, and mushrooms. Very nice service and glad I signed up for the membership that is available. This location and all the locations are different so I recommend it highly to try out the one in your nearest city. They aren't everywhere yet but I hope they will be making more chains because they treat you like family and you are always in good hands here. Never a bad dine. I've been coming here since 10 years old and I'm almost 35. Thank you for the upmost service and hospitality. My 2nd Home for sure!",

    "text": "The Palm is located just inside the Forum Shops immediately as you exit Caesar's Palace. It's a classic New York steakhouse (born 1926) that serves familiar upscale comfort food such as steaks, salads, Lobster and chicken parm.  There has been a recent renovation which opened up the restaurant a bit, making it less dark and more lively/louder.  It has the feel that it is populated with regulars and has a rewards program to encourage repeat visits. If you are a member, you will benefit from their free lobster offer on your birthday and discounts with your points.  The walls are covered with caricatures of local celebrities and if you dine there often enough, you might get your own caricature on the wall.  The service is warm and you are usually treated like you are a regular, even if you are not. Great touch.  The food is all around of very high quality and delicious. No complaints here.  We had one steak that was ordered rare and came out medium well. It was quickly remedied and the server made it a painless replacement. A free dessert was offered. Classy!  5 guests in our party, all 5 were fully satisfied with the experience. Would recommend, we'll be back!",

    "text": "My boss kept raving about the Palm in Boston so on a night in Vegas when we had no plans, my husband and I decided to give it a try and boy, were we glad we did! In the year and a half since, we've been back to this location several times as well at the downtown Los Angeles and San Diego location. However, the Vegas location is the best in my opinion, mainly because of the service.Palm has become one of our favorite go-to restaurants.  Don't expect a hip and modern vibe here- Palm is classic old school and perhaps that's what makes it good. Classic food such as filet and lobster- you can't wrong with that. But the the way the food is cooked here and the freshness of the ingredients is what really makes it stand out. Although I've tried a few other things on the menu, the filet mignon is to die for. Its cooked perfectly, a little bit crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. The Gigi salad is worth trying as well but beware-its quite large and could be a meal in itself. Once again its a simple salad but everything is so fresh, you'll swear they have their own vegetable outside.   If you've never eaten here before, make sure you let them know. On our first visit, we were given a slice of cheesecake on the house. I'm not a cheesecake fan ordinarily but that's a damn good cheesecake. Apparently, its not made fresh there but shipped from New Jersey but I think that's what makes it so good, ha!  The Vegas location is one of the few open for lunch so be sure to take advantage of the business lunch. Its around $20 and is a great way to try out the food at Palm without breaking the bank.  One last note, join the 837 club, you will receive great coupons that make it worth your while such as free entrees. When a filet is $45, its a great deal.",

I've been to the Palm in Tyson's Corner VA, which is equally nice, but it was a work event in a private room so it was hard to judge.  So when we realized we didn't have reservations, but the Palm in Vegas could take us for dinner, I jumped at the chance.  It was pricey, but very worth the money.  I had a gut-busting 26 ounch slice of heavenly prime rib - and it was cooked perfectly.  The potatos au gratin were okay, but I like the ones at Ruths Chris better.  We were so full we didn't have dessert, which is too bad, because I've heard they're great here.  Overall a great, traditional restaurant.

The business lunch special is still not a bad deal for $19.50 Service was generally attentive since it was slow I reckon, I had the 8oz fillet and I think I got someone else's steak. Should have sent it back because it was medium well to done but F**K it I was hungry and it was on someone else's dime and didn't want to stir things up. The hash browns and chips they serve are excellent. Some of the desserts they serve up are huge enough for 3-4 people. Not the best experience I've had here but it was OK.",

After having their Prime Steakburger Sliders, it makes me wonder why I have never gone there before.  It's an AWESOME deal!!  I came here with Lily D. as she stopped by the Strip for a bite to eat before picking up her friend at the airport.    I have to agree with many Yelpers and say that Palm Restaurant has one of the best Happy Hour Menus on the Strip.  Take a look at these Prime Steakburger Sliders (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=pXbvoEThlGea5fTpxqbV2g\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  They were with applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, and pesto aioli.  DELICIOUS!!  Now paying just $4.50 for them during happy hour was straight up ridiculous!  They're normally priced at $10, but they're even more desirable if you get them during their Prime Time at the Bar which is usually M-F from 4:30p-6:30p and from 9:30p to closing.  Lily D. ordered the Nova Scotia Lobster BLT Sliders which contained Nova Scotia lobster salad, applewood smoked bacon, oven dried tomatoes, avocado, and micro greens.  They look awesome as well but I was still working on my Steak Sliders.  I'll have to try those next time since they were $4.50 for Prime Time as well!  Palm Restaurant will definitely get another visit from me in the future as I will attack the rest of their Prime Bites Menu and maybe also to try their steaks as well.",

All the staff were really nice and it does seem like they were making an effort for everything, it just took forever to get our food. We ordered the lunch special where it comes with an appetizer, entree, and dessert and in between each one just seem to takes forever before the next one would come out. So we were done with our soup and awkwardly waited for the main course to come to us, finished with that and just sat there to chat so long that we forgot we still have dessert left, and on top of that we had to get someones attention to give us the bill and it's even longer of a wait whenever you pay in card.   Maybe we didn't order the right thing, but food tasted ok. I understand the whole concept of portions that are meant to be smaller, but rich in flavor, but my food was average. It's all good, all the extra wait time made me forget how hungry I was. It's just funny because we decided to sit inside instead since all of outside were full so it just didn't make sense to me how it wasn't busy in our section, but the wait time were still long.",

My girlfriend had just bought a large frozen drink for our expected walk down to the Palazzo (before we spontaneously stopped into The Palm).  Luckily, unlike many other places in Vegas, they did not put up a big stink about her bringing the cocktail in.  Our server was so great, attentive, yet not meddling.  Our water glasses were always filled in as needed.  Unsure between the Caesar Salad and Chicken Noodle Soup as our first course (due to some hangover recovery dietary needs), our server surprised us by bringing both!  We got the Chicken Parm, which was good...if anything maybe the tomatoes a little too sweet, as the main dish and the half chips/half onion rings as the side.  It was so much food that I can't imagine anyone finishing a Lunch Special by themselves.  Even with two of us, we brought about half of it home.  The cheesecake dessert was also delicious.",

Dry aged steak special was exceptional (one of the best steaks ever eaten) lobster was fresh flavorful and cooked to perfection. Creamed spinach was rich and wonderful. Service is family friendly and refreshing. Ask for Larry Close, Palm's seasoned General Manager and Las Vegas' finest host!",

Food is always on point here, whether you go with light fare like a good burger or salad, or you opt for a more complete meal. The salads are excellent and I recommend their fish and meat options.  Service at the Palm is really great, and very unlike typical Strip experiences. The waiters take the time to take care of you and they make great suggestions.   Finally, location location location. Nestled right between Caesars and the Forum Shoppes, the Palm is the best place to stop between shopping and gambling for a drink or a meal or both!",

Not our first time to visit this location, this visit was yet another example of consistency - great food with excellent service.  The filet was very tender with a great flavor, and the two sides we shared - green beans and regular mashed potatoes complimented the meal.  Overall value of this steakhouse in terms of food and pricing are, to me, much better than the signature steakhouses in most of the Vegas casinos and worth the trip.",

    "text": "This establishment in is in a price range I would normally avoid (although I'm not sure why since I don't mind jamming that much $$ into a video poker machine), but my sweet and generous nephew was in town and called to invite me out.  I was initially hesitant since I hate to dress up in anything more formal than jeans and a t-shirt, but I bit the bullet because I was hungry and the family was basically shoving me out the door (apparently I was \"in a mood\").   So, attired in what passes for my Sunday-Go-To-Meetings, I entered through the self parking lot to discover it was a very short walk just around the entrance to the Forum shops. I already liked this place.  And I needn't have worried. The seating spills out onto a patio area that basically renders it into a food court, and the other patrons were dressed in styles ranging from very casual slacks and shirts to suits and sequins. Just depends where you were earlier or where you're going later, I guess.  On to the food: Crab cakes were delicious, possibly the best I've had. Long ago I resigned myself to the fact that crab cakes were made of shredded meat from the ankles and antennae - where else could you get such miserable, puny strands? Not here. Actual lumps of sweet, juicy meat and delicious sauce. The lobster bisque was probably the second best- old TJ's at the Hilton was my fave, but I had no complaints about this version. And no doubt about it - the prime rib WAS the best both Sugarmarine and I have ever eaten. We were too stuffed to actually finish, but that did not preclude us from ordering some tangy. delectable key lime pie.  And the leftovers? The waiter packed them up for us, and we discovered that part of the meat had been made into sandwiches for convenient dining later that night. Or on the car ride home. Or the elevator.",

This is probably my favorite place to go to satisfy my lobster cravings . The bone in Ribeye was nicely prepared, and went well with the lobster truffle butter that we ordered . I loved the garlic mashed potatoes ! The service was ok. I mentioned that we had a bday at our table, but the lack of communication from hosts to server was disappointing. We received our desserts with no candles and so, awkwardly we had to ask for a candle so that a bday picture could be taken . It just showed an apathy on their part. Rafael, the Busser was awesome . He was attentive and went above and beyond to make sure we were ok. He was probably the only positive looking person here. Most of the staff seemed like they just didn't want to be there today. I probably won't go here to celebrate special occasions anymore. It's more of a place that you can go to splurge a bit and casually dine. All in all, I still have the yummy taste of the Nova Scotia lobster in my mouth! Very happy!",

The restaurant looked as if it was trying to be a classy, upscale place to eat, but if only the food lived up to the look of the place.   The waitress was okay, didn't get her name but it seemed like she didn't care to give us great service, probably because we were a bit younger than the people who dined here. They took about 45-50 mins for our entrees to come out, and the waitress didn't really check on us as much either.   We ordered a good amount of food and we were disappointed. My bf had the steak, some mash potatoes, and the lobster Mac & cheese. I got the chicken parmesiana and the lobster bisque. The mash seemed like it was instant mash potatoes, the Mac & chz was eh. His steak was alright, a little too charred but it was okay. My chicken parm was gross. It looked so messy and as if they just plopped some fried chicken filet with some cheese and sauce. The lobster bisque was so salty and there was like 2 little chunks of lobster in it. What a joke. Looked like some damn diner food in my opinion, not an upscale restaurant. Which also is ridiculous since the prices for the food are crazy high for the bad quality it was. We knew how much the food was going to be, so money wasn't a big issue until we tasted it. I didn't even finish my food, I took like 5 bites and was just done. My bf only finished his steak and that was that.  I don't recommend coming here if you have taste buds and are expecting delicious food.",

Our server (Kirk I believe) was perfectly present, not absent not frequently lingering. As we continued I selected the 12oz filet as did 3 other members of the party, and one ribeye. The ribeye was bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I requested my filet medium rare, another was suppose to be medium. Plates were misplaced as my steak was medium rather then medium rare and vice versa. We paired our steaks with a lobster truffle butter which I would highly recommend. As we began to enjoy I noticed a pungent vinegar taste reoccurring throughout my filet. I tried the others and they didn't not acquire this off putting taste. I was happy everyone enjoyed they're meal but I was quite disappointed and barely finished my dish. Overall I would award Kirk 5 stars for the service but 3 stars for my pungent filet. Brussels sprouts lacked flavor as well as the \"duck fat\" fingerlings. Mushrooms were excellent!",

They weren't very busy but still slow (after almost 20 minutes of not seeing my waitress to try and order, I almost got up and left...which I should have done). The menu on OpenTable is not anything like what is actually available at the restaurant either which was very disappointing.   In general, the servers were just very unprofessional for a \"high end\" establishment. A small group of them were gathered in the corner (maybe 6 feet from me) and were doing nothing but talking trash about people well within ear shot almost the entire time. Not cool.   The food itself was barely edible. She asked me no less than 3 times how I wanted my burger cooked (med-rare/med). It came out as well done+. Since she had disappeared for 20 minutes and I was running really short on time at this point, it was a bit of a lost cause and I ate part of it since i was starving. Eventually the manager(?) came over and tried to make it right and he was very nice and apologetic. He was really the only positive part of the experience, everything else just plain sucked.   I had to ask the waitress for every little thing which was super annoying. Silverware? Ketchup for my burger? C'mon, amateurs shouldn't be working at a place like this. Presentation was lackluster as well. Then it took at least 10 minutes to get anything. I was there for 1 hour+ and just disappointment to show for it. There's too many other great dining options nearby to bother with this place again.",

I have been to The Palm three times now and I can safely say that I do not like their steaks. They promote simplicity but I think that they seriously discount flavor. The veal chop, on the other hand, was outstanding. It now gives me something to look forward to if I am drug in here (again) against my will. The three cheese potatos were very good. The waiter was fully capable of handling seven drunk, hungry almost 50 year old men. You could tell this wasn't his first rodeo. Only gripe about the service was that when it was time for the check, he disappeared for about 10-15 minutes (why do waiters do that?).   If you want the testosterone fueled steak experience, this is your place. Upturned face.",

We had the best waitress, as well as all the other support and management staff being excellent and fantastic food in a perfect setting.   I prefer The Palm to upscale steakhouses. It feels a bit less like the kind of place a bunch of dudes with bravado and too much testosterone go to have big steaks and talk about all their money, cars and pretend women. Something about it is a bit more muted and the vibe is just right.   The initial basket of bread is excellent- I love the raisin bread. Also, through September, they are offering 50% off wine bottles on Sundays. Quite a good deal! I was in the mood for an incredible burger of all things and decided to go for it and it was the real deal. Fantastic! The manager came over and shared what cuts of meat go into it and made sure we were having a good time. We also had crab cakes and the wild mushrooms. Everything tasted great and the 50% off wine was a great and unexpected addition to a great meal.   Definitely worth your time if you are looking for an intimate and relaxing version of the steakhouse type experience.",

One of the few open for lunch, but since it's in the forum shops it has to be. Order the 15.95 lunch and you can choose from a small steak or piece of fish, and a couple other items and with it you get potatoes as a side and veggies and coffee at the end. Add a glass of wine and for under $25 bucks you have the most decadent lunch.  I have not been here for dinner, but sitting inside with a friend having a long lunch is one of my favorite things to do at Ceasers. The staff is incredible and made a lunch with my mom extra special not too long ago. Two thumbs up, and I will continue to go again and again to this place!",

    "text": "Three and a half stars for The Palm.  I met my wife here for lunch one afternoon while in Vegas for my conference.  This restaurant is located right inside the Forum Shops via the Caesar's Palace casino.  This is a chain restaurant that we've been to before when we were in LA, so we thought we'd give it a shot in Vegas.  The Palm is a steakhouse, but they do offer several other things.  We were some of the first people to arrive, so we got a nice spot outside the restaurant where we could people watch.  It's a fairly pricey restaurant for lunch, so if you're dining on a budget you may want to skip this place.  My wife and I both ordered the prix fixe lunch.  It came with salad or soup, entree, and a dessert for around $26 per person.  We both ordered the Caesar salad, mine was pretty good, but my wife had some brown lettuce in hers, so that was a bummer.  For our entrees, I ordered the two 4 ounce filet medallions, while my wife got the salmon.  I thought both were quite good.  For dessert my wife got the flourless chocolate cake, while I got the cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  Again, these were a very nice portion and were good.  All in all, there wasn't much to complain about.  Our service was good and we were in and out of here in less than an hour.  As I said before, it's a little pricey for lunch, but then again, so is just about everything in Vegas.",

I was dying for steak sauce to give it some flavor, but thought it might be rude to ask.

Thank goodness our party picked this restaurant as the thought of walking in heels to another hotel was frightening.   No doubt this restaurant is consistently good with excellent service. We were a group of twelve, our table was set up in the back dining room. From the moment we sat, the service and attention we received was outstanding. What I love about this place so much no matter what city you are in, although it is a high end restaurant, the waiters are not snobby or uptight. The total opposite, they are funny, knowledgeable, and a True delight!   They were running a special for two people which was Lobster with two sides. Everyone at our table nibbled on calamari and other appetizers. I was busy socializing and drinking Honig Cabernet Sauvignon. Great little Cabernet Sauvignon for the price. I adored our waiter who realized very quickly I was enjoying the wine the most. He never ever let my glass get below half. Who really knows how many b bottle's I myself had because it was a very very long dinner. We were there over three hours. whew, yes I needed to drink.   Hubby realized he better get some food in me quickly. Our lobster arrived with a side of spinach and mashed potatoes. Hubby took my shell off for me so I could enjoy my lobster. I am not a huge fan of lobster, can take it or leave it but wow this was amazing. It melted in your mouth with a sweetness of pure delight. It was one of the best lobster's I ever ate. Yeah, they made me a fan of it. Everyone at our table enjoyed their entrees very much, some of the steak dishes made me a bit jealous.   My sister and her husband were dining on the other side of the restaurant and they asked their waiter to play a trick on me. It was comical and he did a great job playing along because again these waiter's are a blast.   From the moment we arrived and had a few drinks at the bar with friendly bartender's, the food was awesome, service impeccable, this is a must visit if looking for a great quality restaurant. At least you get consistent great food and service unlike a couple of other high end restaurants in Vegas that are a ripoff.   Much thanks for a great evening, you were all wonderful. Highly recommend.",

Unfortunately, I made the reservation for 7:00 and then we ended up eating lunch around 3:00, so we weren't very hungry when we sat down for dinner. Everything was so good, I wish I had room for more sides or maybe a dessert.  I ordered the 14oz filet even though I didn't think I could eat it because it was only about four bucks more than the 9oz. It was huge. No way was that thing under a full lb. I ordered it medium expecting a perfect mid rare and that's exactly what I got. Tender, juicy, and delicious. It ranks up there with the best steaks I've ever had. At just under $50, it was almost a bargain when you consider that you normally pay $30 for a filet half the size. The sides are served family style, and the only one we tried was the au gratin potatoes. They were the best I've ever had.  Service was excellent. Friendly, fast, and very professional. I'd be happy to come back to this restaurant.",

Your server pours the hot bisque in a swirling motion around the lobster centerpiece and fills the bowl. The bisque is velvety smooth with a rich, hearty flavor of lobster. The creme fraiche makes the bisque creamy and luscious. Add a couple of grinds of fresh ground pepper and you're good to go. Thumbs up, way up!  The 18 oz. New York strip was cooked to a perfect rare and had optimum seasoning. Its juiciness and char-grilled crust really seals the deal. The lobster tails were cooked to perfection, succulent, and sweet. The drawn butter brought even more sweetness out of each tasty morsel. Thumbs up, way up!  The Brussels Sprouts were perfectly cooked. But it was a little too heavy on the lemon. It definitely needs to be toned down a bit or else sprinkle lemon zest on top for a nice zing.    The French fries are topped with parmesan and garlic. These fries are da bomb! It's made with fresh cut potatoes with a light, crispy outside and tender inside with a hint of kettle chip flavor. The parmesan garlic seasoning is perfect. Ask your server for a side of ranch dressing and you're set. Their ranch dressing is so good! Thumbs up, way up!",

Only problem is steak was ok, Caesar was overdressed, and Key Lime was not good.  Too bad.  Will not be returning.",

The staff are fun and personable (not stuffy like some fine dining restaurants). They willing sat us right away once we learned that some of our party would not make it.   For an appetizer I had the ahi tuna with seaweed salad. The tuna was seared beautifully and the salad was very tasty.  For my main entree I had bone-in ribeye (its huge) cooked medium rare with no added sauces. This was BY FAR the best steak I have ever had. The Palm just knows what they are doing. Add a side of brussels sprouts and I was set.",

    "text": "We could not get reservations to any restaurant we wanted to go to, so we decided to go shopping!  Palms was the first restaurant we saw entering the Forum.  I love eating at this restaurant in NY, so we figured we couldn't go wrong with this choice.  The only thing was would we be able to get a reservation and YAY!!! we did!  We returned here and we were 30 minutes late (my fault, SUE ME i'm a girl)  We waited 5-10 minutes, and were finally seated.  We were stressing out since we had to be at the ABSINTHE tent at 9:30 and it was already a little past 8.  As soon as the waited came to the table, i got straight to the point.  I told him listen, we're on a time schedule and we need you to work with us.  He understood and can I tell you, he did an absolutely AWESOME JOB.  Isreal = best waiter EVER!!!!! and he even gave us his card since we had to skip on dessert and said next time dessert was on him.  How freaking cool is that. :)  We started off with 2 stoli elit martinis, and ordered a bottle of pinot noir.  The waited used a decanter, I was pretty impressed.  We ordered the shrimp cocktails, and clams casino for the appetizers.  The shrimp cocktail NEEDS the horseradish inside the cocktail sauce....seriously was freaking AMAZING!!!!!  The clams casino had the bacon on the side, I thought it was amusing that not 1 had a piece of bacon on top of it.  (def didn't bother me)  and I went along and dipped my bread in the sauce (yummmmmmmmay)  I stuck to the good old 3 lb. lobster.  and we ordered asparagus for the side.  The girl who helped de claw the lobster also pulled the tail out so I had nothing to do, which was excellent bc i was NOT dressed to be pulling out no lobster tail.  He ordered the rib eye medium w/ a baked potato.  You didn't need any type of sauce or extras bc the steak was perfectly cooked.  Overall, the food was pretty perfect and the service was EVER BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would say this experience was better than the one i've had in NY.",

We had reservations for Del Friscos but had to switch to the Palm due to a scheduling conflict. Del  Friscos atmosphere is more gentlemen's club, polar opposite of the Palm.  Once our whole party arrived we outgrew our table. They were able to move us to a larger table on the spot.  The service was very attentive to start but as the place filled up it became a bit less attentive. The appetizers arrived very quickly but the pause for the entrees was about 25 minutes.  When the steaks arrived they were cooked as ordered and very good albeit wet aged as I prefer dry. Wine selection worked well and we had a reasonably priced Malbec, actually many of them.  There are so many steakhouses in Las Vegas even multiple ones in the same hotel. I would probably skip this one and try another or just go back to Del Friscos.",

Martini w blue cz olives yumm. Only thing I'd like to see added is a new trendy homemade steak sauce like some of the other trendy places in town.

I had their burger and my husband had the philly cheese steak. I loved their bread that they bring out before your food. We both liked our food. My burger was my favorite, fresh and abundant in meat. Descent lunch for about $45 including tip. The restaurant is on point! No wonder they have been around for a while. Says a lot about their quality of food and service. Unlike the new restaurants in Vegas who screams for attention with their overpriced mediocre food, Palms restaurant is one of the old school restaurant who everyone needs to follow. Thank you Palms!

Terrific service too! What more can you ask for from a top Vegas restaurant! Important note - you will most likely have leftovers - if you take a to go bag and are attending a concert at Caesar's, they will not allow you to take the food in. They check inside your purses too.

    "text": "Having been here before with very positive experiences I took a friend out to dinner for her birthday for whom it was her fist visit to Palm. The dinner started well and we ordered cocktails with both of us deciding on an appitizer, filets cooked medium rare and some sides. When the food arrived everything looked great and my filet was perfect. My firend's filet was overcooked to more of a medium well. Disappointed for her, I suggested we tell the server and send it back but she insisted didnt want to ruin dinner. I suggested a few more times but I also noticed the server did not check on us through dinner. My friend mentioned she will just give feedback since they should know at least know there was a problem. Well after we were finished, the server finally came to the table to ask if we wanted desert. I had let Palm know of the occasion in advance and at this point my friend proceeded to politely let her know that her steak had been overcooked and a bit dry. The server asked if she wanted another steak and of course the answer was no as my friend did eat most of the filet and clarified that she just wanted to let her know. I was hoping at this point that the birthday desert done at Palm would salvage the experience. The server left the desert menu with us but shortly returned with the check stating that since there was a problem with the filet, they removed the charge in lieu of her birthday desert. ???? First of all my friend didn't even know about the desert since she had not been there before. Second, we didnt ask for anything to be done and they should have asked if that was what we wanted. We didnt even elude to a credit request. Essentially, feedback was provided and the message to us as customers was to leave.   How horribly rude of Palm and also very embarrassing for me since I recommended the establishment.   Being locals to Vegas and having plenty of favorite spots and first class service restaraunts in the area, we will not be back. We will be sure to steer recommendations of friends, travelers, business associates and family elsewhere.   Shame on Palm for clearly showing that your customers do not matter.",

    "text": "Overall:  The steak is cooked nicely and the wild mushrooms side dish was delicious.  It's a chill, old-school style steakhouse to hang in, and very casual.  Although I've personally had a better experience in other steakhouses, Palm Restaurant still has its own character and provides a finely cooked steak.  I'd still come to this restaurant if a friend wanted to go, but I wouldn't recommend this place to others.  NOTE: My friend and I came here because we had the Amex $50 gift card which basically gave us a free steak.  I still consider overall value (price paid vs food & service received) from the total check price.    Setting: Spontaneous dinner to take advantage of the $50 Palm Restaurant gift card from Amex, Monday 08/29/2011.  Thumbs Up: Filet Mignon, cooked medium (chef cooks the steak to perfection).  Wild mushrooms side dish was delicious.  Thumbs Down:  Service staff not knowledgeable about the pairing the wines w/ their steak.  A merlot was recommended that tasted bleh w/ the Filet Oscar, but good w/ the wild mushrooms.  Black peppercorn sauce is not worth it, as it tastes just like spicy brown gravy.  DO NOT get the Half and Half side dish (basically potato chips and shoestring onion rings) because they don't cook it well - oil wasn't hot enough so the chips and onions basically absorbed too much of the oil, making it taste extremely greasy.  Creme brulee is too thick for my taste and the burnt top was too thick.  Tip: They offer a lifetime club for $25, but you get it back as a gift card.  It's worth it if you like to frequent this place.",

Our waiter was fantastic at being both personable and attentive without being obtrusive. He explained things clearly and even made small talk.  We walked in after scouting around the Forum Shoppes for a not-very crowded restaurant, but also one where we could sit and talk for a while because we were waiting for our parents to get out of the Celine Dion show.  It had a nice old-school steakhouse feel with dimmed lights and deep mahogany, but also had some cartoon caricatures on the wall for fun.   As for the food, I was semi-impressed.  First off, the drinks looked impressive, but overall were just expensive.  It was $3 for a little glass bottle of Coca-cola! Cute.....but pricey.  My brother ordered the Chicken Parmesean (which was HUGE....like the size of my head!) with a side of Spaghetti Marinara.  The chicken and pasta were pretty good! Unfortunately, since I had a much smaller appetite, I decided to order two appetizers instead of a full meal.  Big mistake! While the portions were outrageously large, the food I ordered was just mediocre.  I had a Caprese Salad (which featured 3 HUGE super thick slices of bland flavorless tomatoes topped with big gobs of also flavorless mozerella cheese and no basil in sight) and the Calamari (nicely battered, but a little over-seasoned).",

Use your expense account -- VERY expensive for the quantity and types of food that are on the menu. It's like a Gucci bag, you're paying for the name. Can definitely get the same thing for the same quality for much cheaper at a better looking place.... but cmon, it's The Palm! Barry the waiter in Vegas is great, a legend.",

    "text": "Food:  2 Star Service: 2 Star Ambience: 3 Star  As a Palm \"frequent diner Club\" member, I have to say this is probably the worst meal I've had at any Palm, and it does pain me to say that.  Greet times at the hostess station and at our table were slow for a late lunch (1:30 on Memorial Day Monday).  We ended up sitting \"outside\" in the Caesar's promenade area because there was a larger party just breaking up inside.  Only four other tables on the patio.  There was just an overall lack of energy, lack of enthusiasm, lack of attentiveness, which is quite unusual for a Palm.  Maybe after a long Holiday weekend everyone's energy level was a bit down.  We went with the Businessman's Lunch special -- my usual go-to meal option.  The Lobster Bisque was beyond salty.  I mentioned it to the server, and she offered to replace it.  I didn't want to bother at that point, so I kind of blew it off (not knowing what was to come).  Had I known, I would have send it back & requested a salad.  Ended up drinking 3 - 4 glasses of water to compensate for the LV parched air and the saltiness in the bisque.  Second course:  NY Strip steak -- both of us ordered med-rare.  Mine was cooked properly (it was a tad thicker than my hubby's) in the middle (edges were overdone), but no flavor and had a mealy consistency.  Hubby sent his back once, and should have sent it back a second time.  Poorly cooked, poorly seasoned, unimpressive steaks.  We each ate less than half of our steaks after picking through them & trying to find more tender tasty bits.  Definitely the worst steaks I've ever had a high-end steak house -- maybe the leftovers on the holiday Monday?  Server ended up talking (and talking and talking . . . ) to the table next to us about a common interest while we were sitting there with obviously \"finished\" plates, and we waited for our plates to be cleared . . . .and waited to order our desserts (\"to go\" because we were fed up)  . . . . and waited for our check  . . . . and waited for its return.  FWIW - the key lime pie was nice, but the cheesecake was spot-on as usual!  We took them with us back to the Bellagio & ate them in the Sports Book while watching day baseball.  That was the best part of the meal, even though we had to bum silverware from the bar in the Sports Book because our server hadn't put any silver, napkins or the usual \"to go\" packets.  Overall, not an overwhelming experience.",

The steaks were on the dry side, despite being cooked as requested (medium). We ordered goat cheese mashed potatoes but they gave us regular mashed that were on the cold side and stiff, like they had been sitting out for a long time. The server did offer to fix the potato order but we canceled before the fresh batch was brought out.   The energy and quality of the food is so much better at the DC Palm (and other locations, I'm sure).",

Helped us out with all our menu questions etc. I have been to quite a few Steakhouses in Vegas now, and the Palm was one I didn't know about to much.   Our experience was a great one though. Was here for the weekend to celebrate with family. The pricing is pretty standard for the filet Mignons, ribeyes, prime ribs etc. I ordered the Wagyu Bone In Ribeye ($60) medium well. The food does take a while to come out, but our server also did warn us ahead of time. All the sides are family style, enough to share with your party. The Ribeye I had was very delicious. Not too salty, cooked the way I ordered it. I prefer the bone-in for the Ribeye and it was good. My favorite side was the creamed spinach, it pairs well with the meat. I have to say give them a try. It's a low key spot that doesn't pop up first in yelp, but it is definitely an above average steakhouse. Food was a 4. Service was a 5. Thank you!",

    "text": "We were here in Las Vegas to visit family for the holidays.  Our anniversary is January 1, and since there are fewer places to go where we are living now, we decided to celebrate here. The Forum Shops  at Caesar's is also one of the first places we went when we first met so it was extra special to go back.  We haven't been to the Forum Shops in ages so we walked around and looked at all the shops. Things have changed a lot since we were here last. I was sad to see that FAO Schwartz closed but so many new shops have opened. It is a fun place to window shop. There are high end shops like Cartier, Tiffany and every clothing designer, it seemed, but they were almost all empty the night before Christmas Eve. Guess Santa did his shopping early. Though there was a bit of a crowd at a store that had Mike Tyson signing autographs. It was close to our reservation or I would have checked it out.   We made it back in time for our reservation although there weren't very many dining and some came in without reservations with no problems. They've remodeled and opened up the place to one big room. It used to be more closed in which also gave it an old time vibe (in a good way). The ambiance is still good, though not really as good as other Palms restaurants.   We had a nice comfy booth with a nice view of the passers by without being out on the patio to eat. We ordered drinks-I had a Prosecco and my husband had a Cabernet-and they were both very good. Our server, Tae, as well as the other staff, were very helpful and attentive.   They brought out a bread basket which had a good variety of breads-pretzel bread, Asiago baguette, pumpernickel and walnut (sweet, dense bread) and a white chocolate and toasted nut (which wasn't very sweet but had an amazing flavor). My husband loved the chewy pretzel bread and I loved loved the white chocolate-although all were wonderful.    They had a special appetizer with 3 of the chef's favorites. A crab cake, a bacon-wrapped scallop and a shrimp in a creamy mustard sauce. Our favorite was the crab cake which was mostly crab with just enough binder to hold it together. They were all delicious although I'm not a big fan of bacon-wrapped anything (I know) because it just overshadows the other but my husband liked it very much.   We both ordered the Maine lobster. They have 2,3 and even 4 pound lobsters. And for a side, we ordered the small (but still huge) half & half which is half house made potato chips and half shoestring onions. The lobster are very fresh with had amazing flavor and the half & half is delicious.   With the bread and appetizers, we were full and needed boxes to take home leftovers. Then they brought a big slice of New York Cheesecake with a sour cherry sauce and whipped cream for our anniversary. We couldn't not eat that so we ordered coffee and enjoyed. The cheesecake was very good. A perfectly dry and dense cheesecake which is my favorite kind. Such a nice touch.   The Palm is a perfect place to celebrate any special occasion as well as a great place just to go for spectacular food.",

My entire family was disappointed. The service was actually wonderful but the food has taken a turn for the worse. We ordered a medium rare New York that came out medium, flavorless and stringy. Our green beans were over cooked seemed like a poorly executed afterthought. With so many great steak options in LV I doubt we will return.",

The food could have been awful and I wouldn't have cared. But that is not the case. The food is wonderful as well. Just see my picture of their bread basket, and you will see that they are not fooling around. This is well worth a special occasion or just a treat yo self event.

    "text": "I'm a Vegas local who dines on the strip every single weekend. Our dinner at The Palm is the worst experience I've ever had. This restaurant is advertised as fine dining, but this is not fine dining.  Examples of fine dining in the strip: Picasso, Twist, Le Cirque. The Palm comes nowhere close to these restaurants.   We made a reservation on Open Table. The hostess told us to wait because there were 3 parties \"checked in\" ahead of us. I have absolutely no problem with waiting, but I'm mentioning it because I've never experienced a wait with an open table reservation--especially not when the restaurant has at least 10 open tables (I counted). We were seated about 10-15 minutes after our reservation. Service was friendly but super slow and awkward. For example, our appetizer plates were removed BEFORE the order for our entree was taken. We sat with nothing on the table for a while. We had to ask for our waiter more than twice.   Food was equally disappointing. I had the baby kale salad. It was greasy, full of stems and flavorless, as the pine nuts and dried fruit all sat on bottom. For my entree, I ordered the 4lb lobster. Staff asked if I wanted help cracking it open. I said yes, and staff proceeded to crack my lobster for me WITH NO GLOVES. When I asked for a seafood fork, he pulled one out of his apron pocket- which was full of pens...  I don't understand how The Palm got so much wrong on this night. We will not be returning, but I hope they get it together for future diners.",

Being that the Palm is our go-to when we are in Vegas we knew what we were going to order. Once we sat down we were greeted by a very lovely server who took our order, every 10 or so minutes she checked on us and apologized for the wait.   About an hour later, we finally got our meal, except our medium steak was rare, Luigi Perez, the Assistant manager then stepped in, deeply apologized and had the steak sent back for a quick re-fire. Unfortunately it still came back rare. Considering we were there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, this was very upsetting to us.   Luigi was so determined to make our meal perfect, he stood in the kitchen until the steak and the sides came out perfect (which it did). And to top it off, the entire bill was on him! The meal started off quite rocky, but it was saved by Luigi and our fantastic server. Thank you both for all your efforts and for saving that very special night!",

I was there as a guest of my generous employer, and I am glad to have experienced this establishment.   Now that that's off the table let's talk about what was on the table this restaurant was amazing.   Meat... 14 oz filet mignon Appetizer... thickly cut Maplewood bacon. Potatoes... augratin potatoes (also known as the potatoes of the gods?)  The Bread Basket had about four different kinds of bread. I only enjoyed the pretzel bun and the sourdough but they were both fresh, I could have been happy with just the appetizers, bread, and the cocktail but then they brought the full layout with potatoes and that gigantic fillet it was life changing!   The young lady next to me ordered surf and turf with a crab stuffed lobster that was over a foot long!  One of the boys that was with us ordered the seven layer cake and four of us ate from it had more than enough!  I visited on Halloween and it was sort of funny that I saw a guy dressed as Richard Petty going into the back room. I thought that was a great costume until I saw Richard Petty the next day at the SEMA show and realized it was really Richard Petty going into the back room!  My reviews always go back to the simple fact that I know we work real hard for her money and if I value and establishment it's because I feel like there was value provided.  If you're looking for that one spot to sum up your Vegas experience with a very nice meal and a great crowd make your reservations early!",

The \"hot spots\" were all taken and we were in the area of Caesars'. With my trust app Yelp at hand I was able to find this place and it took us into the resort to hole in wall type of restaurant. We enjoyed some great cocktails and variety of bread-sticks to start off. The  waiter recommended the daily special of the Parmesan Veal Chop. We knew it was going to be a big meal when the waiter came by to extend the table out for us. WOOOW is all we could say the sheer size of it was incredible. The veal chop was not just a big portion but had excellent flavor. One of my favorite veal chops that I have tasted. A great spot in Vegas that is not well known but a very great place to enjoy! A must try is the Creamed Spinach a great side with any meal you choose.  Will try it again at my next Vegas business trip.",

It's of a higher level chain than your Cheesecake Factory in that they have a smaller menu with better items.  They are mainly good for steaks and seafood.  For seafood, they have a 3 pound, 4, 5, and maybe even 6 pound lobster.  You may not find that at too many places.  The food is of good quality.  If you think of restaurants on a scale, and there is a line down the middle, I would say that The Palm is around the 75% range.  Not the greatest, but better than the median range.",

I am going on the rant about it because it has happened very OFTEN. I am annoyed that she ignores her customers at the bar when she is engaged in to flirting and conversation with a male customer, she wont even turn to see if a new customer has arrived to the bar.  Literally it will take her about 10 to 15 minutes for her to turn her head.  When she finaly decides to give you attention  if you are a lady she is not friendly at all...her attitude is bad. I dont think I shoul be screaming to try to her her attention after all is her job to be aware of new customers arriving.  She continues doing the same to the day.  I work at the mall and I eat there bery often now I just avoid the days she is there delivering poor service and making the restaurant look bad. I commented it with other people that frequently eat there surprisingly they have experienced the same treatment from the same lady. The mall work force is small and we all know eachother.

Walking in, I noticed the place was a bit on the crowded side (not people crowded, but everything close together crowded).  I wish the restaurant was a bit bigger so there's a bit more walking space.  Anyway, on to the food!  Appetizers: - Calamari 2 orders:  Crispy, tasty, and perfect bite sized. - Crab Cakes 5 orders: AMAZING!! They don't bread it so it's all real crab.  The mango salsa and hollandaise sauce just makes it even more amazing!! At $14 for one it's a bit on the pricy side.  Entrees: - My main dish was the 9 oz. Filet mignon. Rare.  The meat literally melted in my mouth.  It was cooked to perfection.   - Salmon: Coworker ordered this as her main entree.  I didn't try it but she said it was tender and good. - Surf n turf:  Coworker ordered this and they brought out a huge tray with the lobster and steak.  The waiter cracks the lobster tableside!!  It was a generous amount too!!  Side items: - Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes:  This went away quick!  It was just perfect.  The perfect amount of goat cheese and it was creamy and flavorful. - Asparagus Fritti: Typical steamed asparagus, complemented my filet nicely.  Deserts: - Bag of Warm Doughnuts:  They literally come out with these dougnuts in a bag and shake em for you.  Served with chocolate and raspberry sauce and whipped cream.  It was so good!! - Creme Brulee:  I'm a huge fan of creme brulee, and this did not disappoint! Served with various fruits.  Delicious!!  Throw in 6 bottles of wine and various drinks, our dinner experience was just fantastic.  Our waiter, Meemo (sp?) was great!!",

He gives the best recommendations and knows how to take care of you! A table of six and we all got the Chilean Sea bass and ate every bite!! I tried it grilled, blackened, and france (no idea how to spell that). Blackened (with Cajun herbs) was my favorite! It's super light and flavorful! If you want something rich and creamy then get the France (breaded in flour and egg was with a white wine and lemon sauce). We also had the Caesar salad courtesy of our waiter and it was the best Caesar I have ever had! As for sides- get the potatoes au gratin and creamed spinach. The mushrooms are good too, but if I had to pick the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin are the best!!!  Thanks for an amazing dinner and time!  -the Pakravans",

My friend is one of the 837 club members and this meal put him over the 10000 point mark so he will be getting his caricature on the wall soon.  According to our waiter, they will be closing and doing renovations next summer, July and August of 2015, so if you are pre-booking things, be aware that they will not be open. I noted the prices had gone up just a tad from the last time. Maybe its the price of beef but the 14 oz Filet Oscar now rang in at $56, up $5. Lobster Bisque was $15. I didn't look at the bill so I didn't notice the cocktail prices. I dropped the place a star because of a few things. One the bread basket is not as good as before, and missing a sweet nutty bread that was always one of my favorites. Two the cocktails were just a little too weak this time. Three the filet itself lacked a little flavor, but the hollandaise sauce was very good. The lobster bisque is still one of my favorites in town.   I go here when my friends go here. I normally wouldn't pick this on my own, as I believe there are better steakhouses at the same price. This meal didn't earn a 5 star rating, but it was delicious as always.",

    "text": "Was in town for the Justin Timberlake concert. My girl friends and I  tried eating at another popular place close by, but the wait was 30 minutes and we didn't want to wait. We made our way thru Cesar's Palace and we didn't want any kind of Italian/pasta food. So, Yelp led us to Palms. The inside seemed so dark, so we opted to sit out on the patio. Much more brighter and more easier to \"people watch.\" We were immediately given some water and the breadbasket. Which, by the way had such great tasting bread! We finished the whole thing!  The bread was soo soft and fluffy. The lunch menu had a great deal, which was the 3 Course Power Lunch meal, but I didn't want to be too stuffed and not fit into my clothes for the evening. Haha! I opted for the Bozzi Burger (medium well) which had aged gouda, smokey barbecue sauce and crispy fried onions. YUM!  We also got a bottle of prosecco for the table. It was a mix of the 2 menus I was holding and the waiter not grabbing them at the right moment, but we bath managed to make my friend's glass fall and break on the floor! I was definitely not drunk! But, after he and several waiters cleaned up the mess, he graciously gave me another \"heavy\" poured glass and the issue was forgotten. They did said that spilled champagne was good luck! And who doesn't need good luck in Vegas, right?!?! =)    As for my burger. OMG. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty was cooked perfect and was very juicy. Every time I took a bite, juice was coming out of the burger! I loved the combination of (tangy and sweet) bbq sauce and crispy fried onions. All the staff members were beyond friendly, we managed to chit chat with at least 3 in our area. The service was perfect.",

The table behind us ordered us a bottle of champagne. We were shocked and appalled when our waiter pulled up a chair and poured himself a glass of our champagne.

Our server was slow and not very attentive.  - Bread basket: This is dangerous!  Too good to resist, and it's not a good idea to fill up with bread before main items. - Half and half: Cottage fries and fried onions. It was a bomb! - Nova Scotia Lobster BLT Sandwich: Crispy bacon, baby arugula, oven dried tomatoes and Goddess dressing. The lobster meat was plenty and ingredients hit a nice chord. - Wasabi and Panko Crusted Ahi Tuna Steak: Sesame cucumber salad and soy dressing. Good try, but fell short of my Japanese-oriented taste bud.  I see a lot of potential in this place, we will come back for the steak next time.",

If I wanted TGIFridays, I would go there and expect zero professionalism!  I expected a higher level of service at the Palm. Also why does every single waiter carry your glasses by the rim where your lips go and not professionally by the stem or at the bottom?  Why did the condiments, bibs and side dishes come so far after the entree at the lobster was actually cool before I receive my lemon, butter and bib?  The lack of professional training here is shocking.",

Having looked at the menu online as well as reviews on Yelp I knew this place would be outside of my price range for food. I ate lunch before I came and I am happy I did. While I did not order food I did order some drinks. One iced tea and one Irish Coffee. When my check came I was shocked to see the iced tea was $4.25 and the coffee was another $12+. With tip I ended up paying $20 for two drinks. Oh my word! That being said, the tea, while small, was a good fresh tasting iced tea. The Irish Coffee, also small, had enough alcohol to feel the burn. And the whipped cream, real whipped cream, what incredibly rich and very thick. Almost too thick to be whipped cream. It was almost as whipped butter. Delicious. I wish the coffee was a tad hotter but other than that, not bad. The service was good too. There were a lot of us in attendance this afternoon and the restaurant seemed to be busy. Still, three or four servers kept our needs in mind and tended to us frequently and almost without being seen. I didn't even see my check arrive.  Aside from the service and the drinks that I did get to experience, the food I saw and could smell seemed great. I was getting hungry. Maybe for a very, emphasize VERY special occassion, I'll try the food too.",

We were in a group of 8 and could stoll converse with everyone at the table wihout screaming.  Now... about the food....   The filet mignon was so velvety and tender. I don't know how else to describe it but perfection. My husband had the sea bass. I hate fish, but this was delicious. We had creamed spinach and goat cheese mashed potatoes.  A little pricey, but well worth it! My husband who hates creamed anything wouldn't stop hogging all the spinach. That speaks wonders...  I will definately be returning here wheb back in Sin City.  Now, could you please just build one in Austin?",

    "text": "As good as it gets. Our server, Lopez, was ingratiating and charming yet had an edge one would expect if we were at the New York location. Instead of asking, \"what would you like to order this evening, Miss?\" to my mother-in-law, he brazenly gruffed, \"...whatta ya eatin'?\" I loved it. Instead of \"offering\" dessert at the end, he exclaimed, \"I'm bringin' ya dessert...you're gonna love it. It's just a matter of whether you eat it here or at home.\" Definitely a welcome change to the sometimes mundane \"proper\" service one usually finds at a fine steakhouse.  Speaking of steaks...holy crap. I ordered the dry-aged prime, bone-in ribeye and it was one of, if not THE best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked medium-rare with a nice crusty char on the outside that really gave a beautiful, bacony like crunch to the outside layer of fat. The sides, creamy spinach and potato gratin, were just as delicious. We also received a nice chilled seafood platter at the beginning of the meal that Lopez graciously put together for us. Perfect starter to such a feast.   Lastly, I have to give a shout out to our busser, Rafael. What a workhorse! After the several messes we made during each course, he somehow was able to manage clearing us and making our table look like we just sat down. Most impressive.   If you feel like having an amazing steak with no upturned noses and lots of charm and attitude, this is your place. Simply fantastic.",

The highlight of our meal was the creamed spinach and the goat cheese mashed potatoes... the sides shouldn't be the highlight.  I had the swordfish dish. The fish was good quality but the sauce wasn't much and the fish was overcooked.. the relish was also way too acidic and unbalanced. Girlfriend got the chicken parm which was decent but no better than anything you could get at a pizza place that also does pasta. Creme brulee was also pretty weak. Not a bad place but not too good either.  IMO if you're going to have simple traditional dishes that everyone's tried a million times over in a million different places yours should atleast stand out in some way.  Also the service was seriously lacking and the waiters/bussers seemed clumsy and oafish.",

    "text": "One of my biggest gripes lately has been regarding price; while I fully expect a burger in a strip location to cost upwards of $15, I find it very hard to pay up when there are amazing choices for under $5 in albeit locations of not the greatest ambiance. It is this reason that I got excited the other day while reading a little blurb on Eater Vegas about a burger deal at the Palm Restaurant in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The starting price was still almost twice the price of some stand out cheap meals I've had, but could this discount help out?  I've already gotten into how much I hate parking at Caesar's so I won't get into that again. I didn't really step foot into the restaurant past the hostess counter because I sat on their 'patio' to people watch tourists in the mall while I ate my burger. It seemed dark, intimate and 'fancy' if you will; you can probably find better information in their gallery than from me. The patio area has about 14 tables directly within the shopping corridor and really does make for great people watching as you eat, or if you're cocky to be seen eating here. The lunch and dinner menus vary quite a bit, with only one burger available on the dinner menu at over $18. The lunch menu gives you the choice of four specialty burgers at $16.90, and a basic one at $14.90.  I went with the 837 Club Burger which as prosciutto di Parma, roasted red peppers, pesto aioli and fontina cheese. My burger came out, and it was huge. So big that I actually slowed down a bit towards the end despite being absolutely starving coming into my meal. The meat had excellent flavor, was cooked almost to order although there were a few random spots of grey. The Peppers had great flavor and the burger was very cheesy and tasty. The aioli was sharp and also very good. The bun was a tiny bit too thick and dry, but was well proportioned to the meat so it ended up being ok. The accompanying lettuce, tomato and onions were not necessary as the various tasty toppings did the trick.  The fries were excellent too; seasoned and cooked well with some a bit undercooked and some crispy. A good variety of textures with none being bad. This was a welcome addition to my meal after encountering so many great burgers with bad fries around town. My normally $16.90 burger cost me $8.37 which I found to be a fantastic deal for what I was given. Even at almost $17 I probably wouldn't have complained too much for the quality, although once you start comparing it to others that cost a fraction of the price you can certainly make arguments against it. Either way, if you happen to be at the Forum Shops this is a great burger.",

Hubby shared the 3 pound lobster with one of our dining companions and he felt it was overcooked and bland.  I had the wedge salad which was not good at all, too oily and impossible to eat - and wedge salad is my favorite.  The dressing ruined it.  I had the petit filet mignon and it was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The asparagus side was delish, highly recommend that. The service was not good. We had to mention many times that we only had 90 minutes to be in and out of there as we had a show, and while our server kept insisting that our meals were \"on their way\"...we waited an inexcusably long time.  The restaurant was not very busy for 8pm on a Saturday night, so we were surprised by the slow service.  I hope this was just an off night. I might try it again sometime, but hope it is better than what we just experienced. We have friends who rave about the one in San Diego...so??",

First our waiter was so awesome, great NY personality and just added so much enjoyment to our dinner.  He treated us well!  Must check out their online specials, we ordered the steak and lobster special and it was such a deal.  Our waiter also allowed us to change our choice of salad and sides.  We also brought our own wine bottle and he didn't charge us a corkage fee!!! Unbelievable!  I am so sad that I didn't write his name down, but he has a shaved head.  Hopefully that helps, make sure to ask for him.  The lobster was like buttah!  It was soo good, plus the steak was done the way we wanted.  Our side of beans and potatoes was great too!  The ambiance is great, lots of cool drawings and caricatures on their walls.  I believe this restaurant started in NY and if you are a frequent diner, you can have yourself drawn on their wall!  We have also come here for their happy hour.. cheap eats and such a deal, but just be forewarned there are no specials on drinks, so that can get your wallet.  Must place to go in Vegas!",

Everything their service, food, wine even the basket of bread was just awesome!   We had two very supportive waiters, softly paying attention to any of our needs.   They offer us a special deal:  50% off huge fresh lobster. I decided to go for it and it was the real deal. The lobster was fantastic! It was impossible for me to finish that in one dinner and half of it I brought to my hotel room. My wife had Filet Mignon with wild mushrooms and asparagus. Everything tasted great! Definitely it worth your time and money. Highly recommended.",

On my last visit it was Flava Flav, but prior to it was Pete Rose formerly of the Cincinnati Reds.  I've passed by and saw Mike Tyson there in the outdoor seating  as well with some of his entourage.  The steaks are always cooked to perfection and I crave for their Chilean Sea Bass.  However, it's the lobster that keeps me coming back and this time was no different.  They tried to talk our group into a 10lb lobster to share but it looked so big we were sure we'd need more people to consume.  As I'm writing this review, I'm thinking of making a plan to go there again this week.",

The service here is good at least with our server, but looking around at the faces of these waiters they look miserable, fake smile on their face when theres a customer which was a bad sign to come. The food here well was just blah, got the boggi burger and the lobster blt. The burger was dry and burnt, the lobster blt was good but nothing special about it just another sandwich with lobster. Atmosphere seems great but it was dead so the ambiance wasn't what i believed or have heard the palms to be. price wise wasn't too bad but when you get more into steaks the price will go up. Overall i don't plan on coming back just because there are so many more choices in Vegas",

My only ding was for the amount of noise in the Palm during dinner. Really didn't expect that.   Please take note that if you are trying to find this inside Ceasar's Palace, that the walk to the shops and restaurants is filled with the stench of cigarette smoke from the decades of smoking at the Ceasar's casino.   I did not ding the Palm for that, but I wanted to lt you be aware of that.",

    "text": "Eww.  Just eww.  I'm not sure what happened to the food quality at this place, but it's definitely gone downhill from the last time I had dinner here.  First, the positive.  1)  The location is fun.  Sitting on the \"patio\" at the Forum Shops location is great people watching for us Vegas locals; 2) The service was great.  Our hostess, waiter and busboy were all very friendly and attentive, however I will say that they were a bit too quick to want to remove my husband's salad before he was even finished eating it.  Now, the negative.  My lobster bisque was very good, I will give them that.  However, my filet oscar was not.  Although the filet was very very tender (no knife needed), it lacked any type of sear or flavor.  Honestly, it tasted like it came out of a microwave.  You know, like when you were in college and would take home steak to reheat later (because you're in college and steak was a commodity not to be wasted)....but it never tasted the same because a microwave kills the flavor and the texture.  Well, that was my steak.  it was gray, bland and mushy.  And the creamed spinach, well...it was nothing to write home about.  The first time I had creamed spinach was at a Palm in Chicago.  I fell immediately in love and I was forever in search of the perfect creamed spinach at each steakhouse I'd frequent.  But this time, alas, this time it was less than love.  Not even really \"like\" at this point.  I took the first bite and tasted vinegar.  No creamy cream, no garlic, no parmesan.  Just vinegar.  Bleh.    Unfortunately, it just wasn't the Palm of my memories and we won't be going back.  Thank you for the great service, but no thank you for the bland food.",

The bf had the pre-fixe menu $50 with lobster bisque, filet, and choice of side (green beans). My filet was ok. It was tender but lacked flavor. The crab cake was ok too. Full of crab meat but also off in flavor. The bf said it tasted like curry. The bf's filet had more flavor only bc he had some sort of lobster brown sauce on top. The lobster bisque was good. A little salty and hardly any lobster chunks. The green beans were basic in butter and garlic. I guess I like Asian style green beans better. Service sucked. Our server was more concerned with catering to his \"older\" partrons versus being attentive to a young couple. I asked for a picture and he took it with my eyes closed and walked off! Barely said thank you and checked on us. Service was disappointing. Food was nothing spectacular. Won't be going back.",

    "text": "I wasn't too excited when I sat down to look at the menu at the Palm - being vegetarian, there wasn't a whole lot to choose from (this is a steakhouse). But I found a tomato mozarella salad that was large enough to be an entree when combined with some vegetarian side dishes that my family ordered to go along with their meaty entrees. Everything was seriously delicious - I particularly loved the wild mushroom side dish. The mozzarella in my salad was soft and moist and they brought me olive oil and balsamic vinegar so I could dress the salad to my liking. The entrees arrived just as my sister's 7-month-old got fussy, and she had to leave the table for a few minutes to walk the baby around. While she was gone, the waiter took her entree back to keep it warm, and as soon as she returned to the table he brought her dish right out to her without us even having to ask.  Our server asked if we'd ever dined at the Palm before, and we hadn't. So, he comped our desserts. It was a really nice touch that I have never experienced at a restaurant before. This guy was a consummate professional, a career steakhouse waiter who has worked at five different Palm locations in the US and Mexico, we found out. He made the experience super pleasant for us.   The decor is pretty traditional steakhouse, with personality added in the form of celebrity caricatures on all the walls. My feet were killing me the night I dined here, so I wore sneakers, and didn't feel like I was getting nasty looks from the staff for doing so - a big plus for me - if I can't wear sneakers somewhere, I'd rather not go.  Do go to the Palm Restaurant if you're in Vegas. You'll enjoy awesome food as well as awesome service.",

He said it was no problem. When we arrive Sunday the hostess said oh it's your birthday and grabbed some plastic sprinkles took us to our table and scattered them on the table and said they'll know its your birthday.  When the waiter arrived I was ready  to order my BIG lobster...he informed me there wasn't one, but he could  do 2   3 pounders... I was soooooo unhappy..but said ok.  They cut open and broiled the lobster...was charred on the inside..not so good...was expecting a boiled lobster I could dig into..very disappointed.  we ordered a chicken parm as well   didn't come with pasta...really?  no mention of happy birthyday. Living in Las Vegas thought wow the Palms would be great to celebrate...really was very disappointed.  Won't go back ever.  Don't mind spending $300.00 on dinner if it's good.

I went for a Dry Aged NY Strip (I never order this) and was blown away by it.  It was massive and damn, damn good.  The highlight was the creamed spinach.  I use the Lawry's one to compare, but they threw in some extra cheese or something. It was like tasting Parmigiano Reggiano for the first time.   It was the best thing I've tasted in awhile.  The creamed corn was superb as well.  I'm definitely going to the one in Northbrook sometime in the near future.",

The only reason I came here was because my friend sent a link  to buy a $25 gift certificate good for a $50 tab. Can't beat that. The filet mignon was a bit salty. but cooked well. Teh Ahi tuna steak was just ok. The sides including the creamed spinach was tasty. It's a standard steak house located inside Caesars Forum, so the food probably tastes a whole lot better once you're tired from shopping.",

Wasn't expecting that... Bummer..  Steak, cooked a shade red too much... Should have sent it back.  But sadly, it didn't have the 'flavor' a $40  cut should have....  Sides, non descript.... Big miss on the asparagus (deep fried, missed that on the menu probably)   The atmosphere was nice though... Wait staff worked hard, BUT she got a little too familiar with conversation; a lot of that can be attributable to the group size and characteristic of the group.  Will I come back, nope....  There are other favorites out there...",

The waiters do not write down orders, so we only got the first 2 and had to wait quite a while for the second 2. The fondue was OK, the pretzel bread that cam with is was great, but there was not enough.  When we asked for more, it arrived almost frozen, we asked for a second basket and the next one was REALLY cold.  The meat sliders were good, the BBQ chicken too.  The best were the crab cakes, real crab meat, not too much filler. Only 3 instead of 4 due to service.",

We had a special business lunch menu. I chose the steak filets served with sauteed mushroom and onions, a side of Cesar Salad and New York Cheesecake.    First of all, I wasn't too joyful with the steak. The dark gravy sauce on the steaks lacked in flavor and I needed to add salt and pepper to my meat. I ordered mine medium and my steak was a little too warm on the cold side to eat. I don't know if it was because I was sitting under one of the hundreds of fans blowing into the tables, however it was pretty damn cold in there.   The salad dressing was kind of distasteful and the lettuce was a little welted.  The only thing that I really enjoyed and loved was my NY Cheesecake in which I am not even a fan of dessert but this cheesecake was really good served with homemade whip cream.    The steaks that I have grilled at home was way better than that, so  I don't think I will be coming back again.",

Wow.....that's a long time!  Back to my reality.....  I ordered the rib-eye steak and hashbrowns......The steak was perfectly cooked and super juicy.... The hash browns were shaped like a flying saucer.  Thick and crispy all aound.  I like mine shredded instead of diced, but still very good.  A wonderful meal.....  This a great Palm.......after I finished my steak, I sat back with my glass of merlot and just enjoyed all the eye candy walk by.

You could definitely assume there was hierarchy and control by the head wait staff, which I did not appreciate.  Both the head waiters and wait hands are in the service business and should respect each other and work together.",

    "text": "2.5 stars. I loved the decor, the steak and company was awesome, but oh the service. As we looked over the menu, I picked up their dining club brochure on a whim. The server took it upon himself to start explaining everything from one end to other without taking a breath. Not a great way to start off. When he finally left, we looked at each other with eyebrows raised.  After we had a chance to look over the menu, he came back and before we even ordered, again asked us if we wanted to join and repeated the 'benefits'. Commission, no? Simply put, it got annoying.   Anyways, on to the menu. We decided to share an appetizer of three jumbo shrimp sauteed in dijon sauce. It was good, but could have been presented better on a small platter, not a large flat dish with literally three split shrimp rolling around. lol  The side of wild mushrooms was sauteed and delicious. The string beans had the option of sauteed in garlic or steamed; we got it steamed and we agreed they were a bit tough and possibly undercooked.   Ok, the filet mignon 9 oz. medium rare - sooo good. Cooked to perfection. The salmon was HUGE....neither of us could finish it. May have something to do with the taste, too - even though it was topped with butter, the fish itself was a little \"bland,\" as my friend stated (his words, not mine!).   After our plates were cleared and as I was leaning forward saying something, our server inserted a small-desk-sized platter of six desserts on the table and asked us which one we wanted. I remember a feeling of wow, a bit rude and I just lost my train of thought. Plus, he didn't even ask if we had room for dessert. Well, we didn't.   Now I come on to yelp and find out they had restaurant week this whole time. The server didn't even mention this, even though my dish was on the special menu. Grrrr....",

Now the patio isn't outside, it's just in the Forum shops. The patio is fun for people watching, but be cautioned in that it can be loud out there and if you want to chat it's not the best option.  We were seated promptly and had bread and water delivered very quickly. The staff seemed very attentive and efficient.   I opted for a Filet Mignon. My wife, who eats here for lunch quite a bit, asked for the Lobster Roll, which is on the lunch menu but not for dinner. They were able to accommodate her request.  For cocktails, I ordered a \"Simply Nectar\", which is a Jack Daniels version of a Mojito. Frankly, it was great and I boosted the review by a star just because of the quality cocktail.  Dinner came and it was fantastic. The Filet was cooked exactly to specifications and the Lobster Roll was perfect.   Overall, a great dinner and cocktails.",

You can order off the menu or just tell your server what you want - that's one of the other things that makes Palm special.

Flemings had a similar deal to this... it's essentially $50 bucks for appetizer, entree, and desert.  (Keep in mind this isn't a dinky entree, you get 2 items)  I chose the Caesar salad, filet and lobster, and pumpkin creme brulee.  The great Honey Boo Boo Child once said in an interview, \"my special juice is gonna make me winnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\" and she proceeded to shake her head and her belly.  She felt a sense of excitement and power as she said this, and the reason I mention that is because I felt that same way as I was eating this meal at Palm.  It was wonderful and made me feel as Honey Boo Boo Child did that day.  I just wanted to dance in place and shake my head and stomach from happiness.  Moving forward, you can upgrade the lobster to a bigger size.  They crack it for you at the table.  Wasn't over done at all.  The filet is cooked perfectly to order.  The Caesar was phenomenal.  I like Caesars where the lettuce is almost to the point that it's soggy, but not quite, and that's how this one is. I know sounds weird, but it's great.  By the time desert came, I couldn't eat.  It was definitely a kings feast, everything came out on one big platter.  They even squeeze lemon on your hands when you're done, what else can you ask for??  Sitting outside gives you the mall forum shops vibe, but sitting inside takes you away, you feel you are at a private restaurant.  Our server Megan is so nice and accommodating.  Great experience.",

We will always book ahead because there are so many conventions here in Las Vegas and seating isn't always available so if you're from out of town, don't assume that there are tables open.  Lastly, we only go when our favorite waiter Barry is on deck. He's always on point and he makes sure that everything is to your liking.",

The waitor took forever to take our order since he was busy, but really like it was over a 30 minute wait JUST to give us water/take our order. Food was okay. We had the steak dish for like $45... The champagne was good of course.   Only thing was there was a drunk guy who sat at a table near by and he totally ruined our night. He said some inappropriate words and so the manager had to ask him to leave, but she came a little too late. Not a restaurant I would be excited to go back to when I visit Vegas again... Vegas was fun as always though!",

The service and attention we received was wonderful.   I started off with the wedge salad, which was very, very good. Perfect amount of blue cheese crumbles and nice big tomatoes. For entree i had the 14oz filet. I was somewhat let down by the filet as i was expecting the same great experience ive had at the LA Palms. The filet was a little tough and there were some gristle lines throughout..... i think i just had a bad cut. Shit happens sometimes, but it was still decent. For sides we had the creamed spinach and mushrooms. The spinach was really good and the mushrooms were pretty standard.   Had a great time here and would try it again. But only after venturing over to the other steakhouses i havent dined at yet.",

I highly recommend that area to sit if you want to be where all the noise and action is. Inside seemed pretty quiet to me.   I ordered off of the special menu which came with an app, entree and dessert. I loved the Lobster Bisque. That was one of the best things I had all weekend. It comes with lobster at the bottom and they pour the bisque over table side. The steak I got came with asparagus, which was just basic. The steak was cooked just as I had ordered it. the server was friendly. I didn't even order the dessert, I was too full! Also the lobster came out and it was the biggest lobster I have ever seen!  We spent about $200 for 2 people with dinner and drinks. Overall I think I was just  a little underwhelmed with the food and atmosphere for the price. It was a little more classic steakhouse than I prefer, which would be a more modern take on it.",

    "text": "Came here for my mom's birthday dinner because we were informed of the 4lb lobster deal for $80 that comes with two salads and two sides. We had a party of 5 and we all ordered different things, so we had a good variety to taste some of their dishes.   For the atmosphere, I did not really like the 1/3 of the restaurant butting out the front entrance in the mall walkway. It just feels like your eating in a mall with just a table and chairs with people walking back and forth staring at you and your food. Luckily, we were seated like half and half from the outside and inside. I sat down at an angle where I can see a little interior and the forum shops. I kept staring at Burberry.   For the food, I tried the watermelon salad with the cheese in the middle of the watermelon. It was different, pretty good and I'd say worth the try. Nothing superiorly amazing that'll make me come back for though. Lobster bisque was okay, a bit towards the saltier side and not as creamy as expected. There was this shrimp dish, forgot the name, but it had Dijon mustard as part of the sauce and it was pretty good. For my entree, I had the double cut lamb chop 18oz. We also ordered sides: the asparagus fritti, goat cheese mashed potatoes, three cheese potato something, and wild mushrooms. I really enjoyed the potatoes. Cheese and potatoes? Hell yeah. Goat cheese mashed potato was different, I'd probably get that again if I came back. Asparagus fritti, no big deal. Just deep fried asparagus but the sauce with it is not bad. Wild mushrooms are no big deal. As for my lamb, it was juicy, fat, and pretty good.   My mom got a cheesecake, whoop happy birthday mom, comped by the restaurant, and it was like your typical cheesecake. Thank you though ! The staff was really friendly. I enjoyed their kindness and happy-go attitude.   Oh and eat the bread. That shiet was addicting.",

I made the reservation since my husband and I were going to a show at Caesar's and the place fared well on yelp. The service was good and the food was all brought out in a timely manner...I just wasn't all that impressed with the food. I asked for my salmon to be cooked \"well done.\" When I ordered I was assured that they cook their fish all the way through...meh...almost. It wasn't as well done as I would have liked. I ate it anyway, not worth it to send it back.   I also ordered the three cheese potatoes au gratin. Very rich and tasty, but temperature wise, not all that hot.   My husband and I shared the Caesar salad to start. Tasted fresh and was good. Perhaps a tad too much dressing. I should have asked for it on the side.   My husband opted for pasta (I know, we are weird!!!) and the pasta was cooked nicely al dente.   To finish off the meal we ordered the WARM BAG OF DOUGHNUTS. Let's be honest, that's the real reason I booked a res at this place. The doughnuts came out warm and in a paperbag that was shaken by the server..... The doughnuts were a little too overcooked but still tasted good when dunked in chocolate and raspberry syrups and whipped cream.   The meal did the trick, but I am not aching to go back. Will try other options next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "It's my birthday...where shall we go?  The Husband suggests Palm Restaurant in the Forum Shops as we've been passing their three course business lunch options during our visits there.  Finally, a chance to take advantage of it!   We chose a table outside so we could people watch, but we ended being the ones to watch!  Their current promotion is the Classic Summer Lobster Dinner for 2.  So what does that mean?  For $89.95, you get a four pound Jumbo Nova Scotia Lobster, split for two.  It's served with a choice of a mixed green or Caesar salad (or soup of the day), and one Signature side dish.  A glance at the neighboring table and you can't help but want one for yourself.  So what was supposed to be a birthday lunch ended being a heavy early birthday dinner!   They start you off with bread and butter and we chose their soup of the day, which was Cream of Mushroom.   With bibs on, our lobster arrived - and what a sight it was.  The tomalley, aka lobster liver, oozes out onto the platter.  The waitstaff artfully removes the meat from the giant claws with a break and a pull.  We immediately start digging in and it doesn't take long to enjoy the fatty rich taste of this delicacy.  As I get started on my tail portion, I'm in need of some drawn butter to give it some added fatty richness!  (This the part where pedestrians can't help but point at what you're eating!  A four pound lobster is huge and it's an easy sell for the restaurant for those dining outside with it!)   The Wild Mushrooms, our side dish, is a nice medley and cooked in more butter!  This lunch is heavily loaded!  As we finish our last few bits, I am stuffed!    But...the Husband has informed the staff that it's my birthday and out the staff comes to sing me a song and present me with a complimentary birthday cheesecake!  It was rich and pretty good!  Yum!      Service was good - we had a leisurely lunch and the staff were professional.  There was a slight gap when we needed to wave down someone for more water, a napkin, etc.   They do offer their 837 Club where a $25 enrollment fee will give you a $25 gift certificate for the restaurant and you can earn points towards free meals, etc.  Ultimately, when it comes down to it, I love the Husband's version of lobster more.  Sure, theirs was good - but his homecooked version has me wanting more.  Therefore, we probably won't be back for their lobster special, but eventually will get around to trying their $23.95 three course business lunch!",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I stopped by in here for their late night Happy Hour after we got in and checked into our hotel. I was starvingggg and just excited to get some food before the alcohol! Happy Hour is only available at the bar and not the dining area which left me a little confused but whatever, I like sitting at the bar anyway-- it lets me see my options of poison. ;) for $3.50 appetizers and I think $1 oysters, WHY THE HECK NOT!?   We started off the night with some beers and they had a really nice selection of beers on tap.   We then proceeded to order the following: - Crab cakes: These were good. They come with I believe house fried potato chips which could have been salted a little more and maybe fried longer for a more crispy crunch, but it didn't bother me too much. It came with a mango salsa dip which made the chips taste a lot better. The crab cakes were good but definitely not the best I've had. I may try this again, but I'd have to be really hungry and nothing else was available on the menu. (i mean when you can choose kobe beef sliders, crab cakes seem nothing but a distant memory!)  - Philly Cheese Steak: My boyfriend adores philly cheesesteaks! I don't know if its the cheese or all that grease, but he loves this stuff. Too bad it wasn't all that great. I was pretty full after one (It comes with 3) and it was pretty bland tasting. This also came with their house potato chips.   - Raw Oysters: We ordered four of these which was good enough to taste since my boyfriend hadn't had oysters in a really long time. It came with the usual cocktail sauce. I really liked slurping these bad boys down! Its really hard to go wrong with raw oysters so I guess they did well in my book!  - Kobe Sliders: Originally ours only came out with 2 which we were unsure of and a little suspicious since I think it was supposed to come out with three? When we were done paying a server brought out one last slider for us saying that the chef said that he had forgotten one. I thought that was a nice gesture but it was pretty late and I was pretty full. Still from what the boyfriend and I had, this one was the winner for the night. It was juicy, the buns were sweet and it had all the right flavors.  I think we wanted to order another one from the menu when this had first came out but their kitchen closes at 10PM.   We have fallen in love with this place and its probably one of my favorite happy hour spots of all time! Our bartender was more concerned in closing up shop at her bar and didn't bother us much which I was fine with. It was a nice first night in sin city for us and we were completely satisfied. I will definitely make my way here again!",

But to her surprise, on above mentioned day she was at the receiving end of some very poor service. I feel it is important that you be aware of the behavior of one of your employees.   My mother, Elsy, travelled to Las Vegas from Matamoros, Mexico in order to celebrate her 66th birthday with her brother and sister. On the said date, she chose to have her birthday dinner at her favorite Las Vegas restaurant, The Palm. Unfortunately, she and her siblings were mistreated by a very rude waitress. Her disagreeable and antagonistic attitude was felt the second she greeted the group. My mother kindly asked her if the restaurant carried a \"House Wine\" and the waitress responded in the most antagonistic manner by asking: \"What do you mean House Wine? Do you want red or white? Do want a bottle or a glass? I don't understand what you are saying.\" A lot of restaurants have some sort of \"House Wine\" on the menu and my mother innocently asked if The Palm offered one. The response from your employee was demeaning and made my mother feel like she was asking an absurd or nonsensical question. This is completely unacceptable and condescending behavior from your employee. My mother, furious and on the verge of tears, then said that they needed time to look through the wine menu. The waitress rolled her eyes and walked away. They would not see her for another 15 minutes. When the waitress returned she showed a severe lack of interest. My uncle proceeded to order a bottle of Marques de Caceres Gran Reserva. The waitress took the order, left and returned almost 20 minutes later with a bottle of Marques de Caceres Reserva (not the Grand Reserva that was ordered). My uncle told her that this was not the bottle they had ordered and she defiantly said that it was. By this point, all 3 guests were irritated by your employee and asked for a new server and to speak to the manager. She said she would tell the manager on duty, Kellie, to come by the table. Twenty minutes passed and no one had been by their table. They finally decided to leave the restaurant.   One of your bussers (possibly another server) approached the group as she could see that they were all visibly outraged and had been disrespected. She notified my mother that the Manager on Duty was a lady by the name of Kellie Endraske and that she should approach her and tell her what she had experienced. The Manager was at the Front Desk greeting other customers. She was attentive to my mother's complaint and told her to please write her an email. My mother does not have an email so she kindly asked me to write one on her behalf. I sent an email to Kellie and the General Manager Lawrence Close on Sept. 14th. I did not hear back from either of them. I sent a follow up email on Sept. 21st and have heard nothing. I understand that this mishap occurred on a Friday night and your restaurant must have been very busy. I too am in the restaurant industry and know this from experience. However, this was her birthday dinner and you asked the Manager on Duty asked my mother to \"write you an email\". If I was in her shoes, I would have asked them to stay at their table and told them they would be sending a new server. My mother might not have been clear when she spoke to the manager, but she wanted to stay and celebrate with her family at The Palm. They did not give her this choice. She did not want any comps. She just wanted a welcoming and friendly server.   My mother was humiliated, ignored and mistreated on the evening of her 66th birthday.  I am appalled to hear that your waitress portrayed a large amount of incompetence and a terrible attitude towards my family. I request you to kindly investigate and take action against her. I trust this is not the way The Palm wishes to conduct business with valued customers. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn of how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.",

    "text": "Unbelievable Service!  Unfortunately, I arrived late for dinner and an acquaintance had a few too many drinks that the waiter was more than glad to serve her (serious liability issue). When I informed her about the drinks the waiter stated, \"oh, she's ok!\" I must say I've never seen wait staff so unprofessional and desperate to make money. The acquaintance joked about Lobster and the waiter took advantage and ordered it for her minus the utensils to eat the Lobster. I had to request that they give her the appropriate utensils. When the waiter checked on our table he only addressed my intoxicated friend about the quality of her food. For those who are not aware of the Las Vegas Service environment, most establishments don't appear to be in control of staff behavior. The staff are left to figure out who has money and who will be served professionally. His behavior overshadowed the excellent food! If it were not for other waiters we would not have received some of the correct utensils, menu or dessert menu! My intoxicated acquaintance was so happy about the waiter's attentive behavior that she said goodbye to him as he stood outside the restaurant talking to patrons who had exited the restaurant. He kindly yelled back to her \"Thanks for the generous tip!\" For the first time in my lifeI worried that I conducted business and paid with a debit card at a restaurant.  I later contacted the Assistant General Manager who informed me that my acquaintance had no problem with the service!  She was intoxicated, so I guess not!    <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d491828-r549314975-The_Palm_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=5f2a3b00aed7bfab2f1f01cf3c047ef952401593e78a9368a624849695bbf09a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

We had the Chilean Sea Bass and the Filet. The Sea Bass was extraordinary. It is difficult to cook Chilean Sea Bass all the way through without over or under cooking it but this was cooked to perfection. I ordered it blackened which added another depth of flavor without being overly spicy. My friend ordered the filet medium well which many would agree is overcooking the meat but to each his own. Unfortunately, it had to be sent back twice to get it to the preferred degree of doneness. Our server agreed that it was undercooked and had it re-fired in no time. We shared some New York Cheesecake for dessert and it was as good as you can get anywhere, including some famous New York delis. The Palm is a special place but is affordable enough to go to regularly and not just for special occasions. This was a five start experience.",

    "text": "Palm, one of the long time establishments located near the entrance of the Forum Shops. How could I not expect a lot because of its prestige, reputation and price point. And to be quit honest the food was \"okay,\" but the service was superb. My family came for Saturday lunch to celebrate my dad's birthday and parent's wedding anniversary.   To start off the bread basket was obviously from a supplier and not baked in house. It was nothing special and was just sliced up rolls of bread, something they should work on. We asked for water initially and surprisingly they didn't ask if we preferred bottled or tap, I guess since we're Filipino they already knew to serve us tap. Hahaha!   I ordered the 3 course Power lunch special ($26). Pretty good deal I must say. I had the clam chowder, nicely done and crackers were served on the side. For my main entree I had the filet mignon medallions which was \"okay\" not the tastiest but edible. I was expecting a lot since this place is known for steaks? I should of asked for the sauce to be on the side because it was taking the spotlight. I was disappointed but oh well what can I do? Finally dessert I had cheesecake to go because I was so full from everything else. When I ate it at home it was delicious and it was on the \"lighter, fluffier\" side in comparison to most cheesecakes I'm used to.   In addition to what I order I tried the crab cakes, which was my mom's entrees. And this was not good because it was made with curry?! I like curry but didn't expect it to be in the crab cake which in my opinion unfortunately made everything all bad.    I probably won't be back because I've had better steaks from places that are cheaper. This was a nice experience to splurge and indulge especially since Palm is known for having their patrons eat in the outside area of the restaurant while mall shoppers eye and droll the food as they walk buy. To give them some credit, the service was on point. Our waters never hit below half. Our party ordered a 5lbs lobster and was opened by the busser at our table. Not sure if he was a busser or our server's assistant because he was so good and on top of it. I don't remember his name but he was an older Hispanic gentleman in his 40s or 50s.",

The young lady that seems to be the manager Kelly was so sweet and accommodating. I had different servers from Elaina, Barry, Dutch, bar tenders Ashley, Kelly, Vic,(yes there are 2 Kelly's working there) all of them were fantastic. I had the veal parmigiana chop one night and sea bass the other both where fantastic. I actually went back a third time just to have the sea bass again (blackened or broiled, both ways were great). I recommend this restaurant. The lump crab cocktail is great too. I recommend the asparagus fritti as a side.",

Once we came in there was no one at the hostess desk and once assistance came he had to walk up to the podium/desk, no one asked how many people or if we had a reservations. We then were sat and our busser Juan really saved the whole  experience. Our waiter came and he wasn't too friendly. Asked about his preference/ recommendation on the menu since I've never been and he just said that it's all good and should try anything.  He wasn't as attentive as expected for this caliber of restaurant  . The salad and break was good but Our main course took over an hour, reservation were at 8:30 and didn't eat until almost 10. We had the sea bass which was good but his steak was just ok. When it was time for dessert we just received  our bill and had to ask Juan for a dessert menu since we had already received our check from our waiter.  Not sure if the service was lacking since they had obnoxious patrons towards the back of the restaurant who were standing on tables/yelling and all or because cause he wasn't in with one of his high roller clients but I was very disappointed since he has loved this place for years. He did state that this was not the norm just disappointed we didn't get the same level of service and food he usually receives but it was ok just not was I expected at all.",

Ive been to Joes Stone Crab many times and have yet to truly enjoy it. Theres always a wait and thats if you can get a table. The Palm really blew me away. The server was really atentive, the steak and accompaniments were all tasty and the price was reasonable. I wanted to try everything on the menu. On a sour note The Cobbler drink which looks great in photos doesnt taste that amazing for $13 and my friend couldnt stop saying as much. It was very flat in taste for such an expensive cocktail.   I'd like to say this is more of a steakhouse where as Joes Stone Crab is more of a seafood restaurant with steaks on the menu.   We cant wait to go back!",

There's hardly ever a wait, unlike Joe's at the other end of the Forum Shops.  It is a short walk from the self park garage and the Forum Shop valet.  (Note: the Omnia valet near the self parking garage is for guests only. Don't bother trying.)    I know caesar salads are boring, but they do it well here and is a huge portion.  They also have a well-balanced lunch menu to choose from.  As many times as I come here, I never feel bored of their menu.    Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots.  I will come for dinner one day.",

    "text": "Oh my GAWD!!! The Palm, located in the Forum Shops attached to Caesar's Palache (Palace, sorry I couldn't help it), has the best lobster in all of Las Vegas! This is legit, huge ass lobsters, yo! No exaggeration!   We brought my husbands Aunt from NYC to dinner and a show for her birthday just before Christmas.  We told Titi, to order anything she wanted.  Sooooo, she and the hubs ordered steaks and a \"side\" of a 5lb lobster!! What??!! Yep, they shared that $99 side. We sure got our monies worth with that 5lber! The claws there seriously the biggest we had ever seen.  I mean, we have traveled the world and this lobster takes the top spot!  Let me take a moment to share how great the staff is at this restaurant. They are a bunch of \"cool dudes\" who know their shit! They are friendly and beyond accommodating! I'm not a pain in the ass but hey, I like what I like! I was going to have chicken parm but then at the last second I said I didn't really want all that cheese (wtf, right). So cool dude, waiter said \"would you like chicken milinese?\" That's not even on the menu! Hell yeah, that is actually what I wanted.  He asked if I'd like a side tomato salad with greens. Of course I wanted that. I was afraid what I was gonna be charged for this side salad. To our surprise, it was included with my cutlet.  We also got a side of fresh cut fries.  Now these babies are way too expensive and you will be like, wtf? $15 for a side? Just get the damn fries. Yeah, they are expensive but they are soooo good! The 3 of us shared them (sorta) and there were some left over.   The drink selection is great, meaning bomb ass cocktails! I will say, they charge per soda as it's served in a small bottle. I'd prefer free refills but wtfe.  Vegas has a lot of amazing steak/seafood restaurants.  I'd go on record and say this place is in my top 3.  Food is always prepared how you'd like it. Even if you like to kill your steak by ordering medium well/well. They will do it.  They may stink eye you but alas, you get what you want! Whoopeeee!",

Had a specialty cocktail the \"sapphire and flowers\". A gun based drink with floral notes. Tart and clean on the palate.  The fresh fish was flounder in a Mediterranean preparation. Nicely cooked and light on flavor but filling.  Solid service too.",

We were both sorely disappointed to say the least. Our dinner was good, but it's disappointing when you really have your mind set on your favorite foods.

    "text": "Went to dinner last week for a birthday dinner. Food was yummy! However, I felt some gaps in the service we received:  To start, I felt that it took a little long to see our server to order appetizers. My boyfriend and I were sitting talking and looking around for a bit, trying to kill time waiting for our server. Then, during our entree with the Surf N Turfs, no one informed us that someone will be breaking the claws for us. So, we were left a little confused as to how we were going to enjoy it especially since no tools we left our table. It wasn't until about 5 minutes into our meal, our waitress said \"Oh, no one is here opening your claws?\" After that the busser came over unprepared, apparently, since she had to leave to grab something a few minutes and then come back. Which I didn't mind, but just to point out for future service correction. Finally, when it came to the conclusion of our meal, we had full plates of au gratin and brussels sprouts left, which or server didn't even care to ask if we wanted to take home. I had to make a point that I would like to take the brussels sprouts home since they were the best brussels sprouts I've ever had. I felt a lack of consideration there.  Aside from service, the corner booth we were in should be closed off or renovated into something else. The pole in front of the booth was a real inconvenience. A REAL INCONVENIENCE. Who would want a large, black structure obstructing his/her view of the restaurant and tv's? I would not wish upon anyone to sit there.  Definitely wished we received a more personable service. Server made no attempt to ask us if we were doing anything else after dinner for the birthday, etc. She was only straight to the point, minimum confrontation.   P.s. the wine glasses that were on the table were not polished well. Very spotty. Not very presentable for something you'd expect from a fine restaurant.  Another thing I was skeptical about was parking in valet since the restaurant \"only had a limited amount of passes they give out.\" I don't want to know they have passes available, park in valet, finish dinner, come to find out they don't have anymore passes and that I now need to pay for valet. It would be pleasant if someone called to inquire, that person can then reserve a pass, and everyone else who asks in person would be first come, first serve since they were expecting to pay for valet anyways.  All in all, thus the reason for three stars. Great food, moderate experience.",

    "text": "I came here with a group to celebrate my friend's birthday. First and foremost, I appreciate that they were very accommodating about my friend's birthday. We thought it was adorable how they decorated the table with confetti, a birthday card, and gave us a free slice of cheesecake at the end.   However, I should also outline factors that contributed to this relatively low rating: 1) The location was a bit hard to find since there are 2 buildings to Caesar's palace and the restaurant is inside one of them, so there was no store front that faces the street. Google Maps directed us to the other building at first so we were late, but they were nice about saving our reservation 2) The wait for food was quite long 3) The presentation of the food was not only very uncreative but even disappointing. As seen in the photos, my dish had the meat and a single piece of cilantro on a large plate. When the food arrived, we did not even feel compelled to take photos because it was simply not appealing. Usually, I'm not picky about presentation, but for a dish at their price point, I'd expect to get the whole package 4) The filet mignon was a bit dry. It certainly does not stand out from other filet mignons that I've tried in the past. Perhaps it would have been better with sauce. My friend's sea bass had a beautiful texture and fresh taste, but the sauce that they paired with it was overpowering. Their mashed potato had large pieces of garlic in them, which made the consistency and smell weird. Not to mention, it's rare to find people who enjoy biting into large piece of garlic. Lastly, their cheesecake was delicious, but the strawberry sauce was way too tarty and sour.   Overall, the Palm demonstrated a lack of creativity in their presentation and lack of thought in the taste of almost all of the dishes that we tried. Although the customer service was good, I don't think I would come back here again. We expected more due to the price point and other ratings.",

Last night we came for my birthday and left happy as can be & stuffed to the gills!  For drinks I had iced tea & my dad had a couple whiskey sours. Rest of table had pop. The iced tea was so refreshing and my dad's whiskey sour was awesome! Perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of whiskey (Maker's Mark for those wondering).   Our waiter brought out a bread basket with butter. I highly recommend slapping some butter on a slice of the raisin bread. We started with the Gigi salad and it was huge! All the ingredients went so well together, but the highlight was the shrimp.   For entrees I had the ribeye which came out a perfect rare. The outside of the steak had a nice char, and when I cut into it I saw beautiful red meat. It tasted phenomenal! Tender, delicious, and juicy; it was everything steak should be.   My girlfriend had the chicken Parmesan and I can honestly say it was the best chicken parm we've ever had. We shared the lobster Mac & cheese as a side and were not disappointed! It was such a rich, filling meal but was packed with flavor.   The rest of our table had veal Parmesan, veal martini & a kids chicken Alfredo. Sides were Brussels sprouts & creamed corn brulee. Both veal dishes were awesome, and the side dishes tasted good too! I didn't get a taste of the chicken Alfredo but my sister said it was some of the best.   All in all, we've been coming to The Palm for years and will continue to come for years. Why? It's consistently great food and the service is second to none. They'll do whatever it takes to make your experience special.",

The filet was extremely dry and the crabmeat had zero flavor as well. I've had better steak at Outback. The mashed potatoes couldn't be fixed no matter how much seasoning I added and they even messed up the asparagus. My meal was over $60 and as soon as I returned to work I threw it all up!

Oh my god, it's sooo good!\" Every time I've heard that, it was a completely different menu item. That's how I knew Palm had to be on my list of places I absolutely have to try. So the other day, on my birthday, I finally tried it.   I don't even know where to begin with the list of reasons I love this place. I guess I'll start with the decor, since that's the first thing you notice. The place may not seem like much, being in the middle of a high volume shopping area. But it's a high dollar, high volume shopping area. So at least you know it's not gonna be like a mall's food court or something. I chose to eat inside. The place has a nice old school restaurant kind of charm to it. There are drawings all over the walls but the servers are dressed nice, mostly the customers are all dressed at least somewhat formally as well. I don't think you'd necessarily be out of place if you were dressed down a bit either. Even though I wasn't seated near it, the bar seemed pretty cool. I had a good enough view from my table to keep an eye on the score of the Jets game (Bonus Points, but really, Go Giants!).   Now on to the next thing you'll notice; the service. The service at this place is outstanding!! Honestly, outstanding isn't a good enough word for the service. I'm just too lazy to pull up my computer's thesaurus, so I guess, just deal with it. These people hustle, old-school Vegas style! Glasses were never empty and everything was prompt. It may be because they knew it was my b-day, but they were like extra awesome to us. I got a personal handwritten birthday card, they made it rain birthday confetti on my table (I swear I'm not making any of this up!!), and after the meal, I got a giant slice of this phenomenal cheesecake along with a few cups of pretty good coffee, all on the house. How awesome is that?? The busboy was from New York too; being all New Yorkers, we B.S.'ed quite a bit about back home. Just even more personal touches on top of the others. Good things, good things. The server on the other hand, had a very thick asian accent; we couldn't understand her very well. It still wasn't bad enough to even take off a half of a star, which is good, because I can't technically do that, even if I wanted to. Moving on..  So I guess even phenomenal service wouldn't earn a 5-star review if the food wasn't top notch. In this case it was pretty damn close to top-notch. I got the bone-in ribeye and their french fries. If I had never eaten Firefly's incredible fries this place would have taken the title of my favorite french fries in this town. So Palm will have to settle for second place in the fry department. Now as far as the main dish; Palm made the best Ribeye I have had in Vegas so far. Dry-aged (expect nothing less for $40 or so) and cooked to perfection. It was juicy on the inside, and seared wonderfully on the outside. It had a great flavor as well; not overly seasoned but seasoned just right. I don't mind getting a $40 steak when it tastes that good and is that filling. I was stuffed. It was a struggle to even put a dent in that cheesecake afterward. And this boy can eat!! I swear I must be 400 pounds on the inside somehow. Or maybe just in another life.   So there you have it folks. I finally tried one of the like 10 steakhouses that I hear people rave about in this town. And I happened to love it.   Oh by the way, when anyone asks me about Palm my response is going to be... \"I love this place, you need to try the bone-in rib eye. They have the best rib-eye!! Oh my god, it's soooo good!!\" Yea, I guess I drank the koolaid too.",

We were asked a preference on indoor or \"outdoor\" seating which REALLY pleases me so I don't have to look like a snob asking for a table that was not offered to us.  The food was fantastic with the only exception being an over-parmed beef carpaccio.  Our steak was cooked to perfection, our sides seasoned perfectly, (fried asparagus being a welcomed surprise), and our caprese salad was plentiful.  The only reason I would not give The Palm a 5 star rating is because our service was a little \"cool\" and unmatched to the higher price of the menu.  Service was pleasant and acceptable but not exceptional, which I had expected with the higher price tag.  I would definitely come back to the Palm, just maybe not for a \"special\" occasion.",

Had reservation for 8 for two, waited 30 minutes to be offered a table that was open the entire time, and was being used by people in the bar to rest there drinks. After I asked if we could wait for a better table he told us no than offered us a table that everyone was crowding around trying to talk to the hostess. Clearly they didn't want us to dine here, overall I just think they treat customers poorly at this location. If my client had not requested this restaurant I would of never came back.  Overall bad experience and was embarrassing to be treated so poorly. Only good part was the bartender who poured our glasses of wine.",

It was a perfect mix of upscale and casual; our waiter was down-to-earth yet polite and the dress code was just \"no swimwear.\" We got the fancy dinner without the intimidation.   There was a lobster special going on (I'm not a huge fan of seafood but it was very clean and quite tasty) so we paired it with steak. We asked for \"medium\" steak, but it came out very rare.

There were mutliple entree options with this menu, including a steak salad with the same 10 oz. strip steak, or salmon. Coupled with the chewy fresh pumpernickel raisin bread and sourdough, you won't leave hungry.  Service was chummy and casual, but attentive. Food came out a bit slow. The soup and au poivre sauce was salty for my taste. Classic steak house feel with the celebrity characatures on the walls gave the place old school charm.

Yes, it doesn't have the hip atmosphere of the others nor is it located near a popular night club or off the Casino floor of a 5 Star Resort in the area, but what it lacks in \"coolness\" it makes up for ten fold in quality and service.  This New York legend has been seamlessly transplanted to Las Vegas and it bares the same food quality and service of their flagship restaurant on 837 2nd Ave in New York City.  Every time I am in Las Vegas I make a stop for their Business Lunch (best deal in town: salad, entree and dessert for $25.90) or for Dinner (I highly recommend the NY Strip).  I've never had a bad meal here and I've always been satisfied with the product delivered.    If you're looking for a Steakhouse to impress friends, attend a business meeting or simply have dinner with a spouse or date, look no further than the Palm.",

The seating process was very nice as they asked us exactly where we would like to sit.   Our service was good, not as detail oriented as I had expected.  A few missteps, but we left happy having gotten everything we needed.   The food was mediocre.  Steakhouse food doesn't tend to be revolutionary or exciting but should be high quality and executed to perfection.  We all had the lobster bisque which was buttery, creamy and dreamy.  The bread basket was a winner as well.  Three sorts to choose from including pretzel bread and the butter was whipped and spreadably delightful.  My filet was tasty and the portion was hearty but lacked excitement and luster.  Hubby's NY was way over cooked from the rare he requested.  You expect your steak to be cooked correctly at a steakhouse - especially a Rare request.   The desserts were tasty and decadent.   Definitely A-OK and we weren't disappointed for $30 each but it wasn't anything spectacular.",

    "text": "The Palm is not a restaurant I would normally choose to go to. I went with others who chose it. It's a chain, and I'm not big on chains. That said, I did enjoy my meal here.  I started out with the caesar salad. It was a good one. The croutons were nice and crispy though probably of the packaged variety. The romaine was green and crisp and the dressing was tangy and tasty. A nice salad overall.  For my entree I chose the surf and turf special which was $54. I dont order much lobster but it seemed like a good deal since it included the salad and a side in the price. The lobster tail was supposedly 6 ounces and the entire lobster tail, including shell may have touched six ounces before being cooked but I doubt it. There was about two ounces of meat, tops. But it was two ounces of VERY PERFECTLY cooked lobster. The tails so often end up chewy but this was anything but. Maybe the best lobster tail I have ever had.  The filet was supposedly seven ounces and I'd say it probably was but it did seem small. For a steak house it wasnt looking like much. This was a simply grilled filet, not broiled, and it lacked the thick char I expect from a steakhouse. The meat was of good quality and again cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare but it was the least favorite part of my meal. It was underseasoned and just average in every way except for the temperature of the meat.  My side was the three cheese gratin potatoes and it did not disappoint. Straight up delicious and there was actually plenty of it this time.   Overall, for lobster, steak, salad and side at $54 it seemed like a pretty fair deal.   The service was ok, nothing special. Our waitress seemed a little intimidated, almost like it was her first day or something.  I would go again but would pick other steakhouses if it was up to me. If this is a special meal and you dont eat at restaurants of this caliber frequently, your money could be better spent elsewhere.  Still four stars since I really cant find anything to complain about and some stuff was excellent but I wish I could give three and a half because only the lobster was anything much above ordinary.",

For our entrees we ordered the veal martini which is one of their specials. I was disappointed with the under seasoned and over cooked veal. My other half ordered the linguine in clam sauce which was also under seasoned and lacking clams.   This is being added to my over priced do not return list.",

    "text": "I have eaten here many times in the past. My experience dining here as a single patron was far from what I expected from a restaurant with the price tag it comes with.  I went to the palm at just before 4 pm. I hadn't had lunch and wanted an early dinner. I was seated promptly.  My waiter left much to be desired. David E. When he found I simply wanted a glass of wine and a full entree--to the tune of $61.00--he seemed to lose interest in me since he couldn't get me to upcharge with additional items.  My food came promptly and my waiter left--I mean I didn't see him until he arrived with the check---but a second server came to check on me a couple of times. My server never offered or brought bread to me---with a dinner entree--the servers were not busy the restaurant was relatively empty.  I asked the second server and he did bring me bread----I noticed all other tables were offered bread.  My waiter returned when I had about 1/3 left and placed he bill on my table. I was not finished---he said nothing. I continued to finish my meal and again, before my glass of wine was finished or my plate was cleared he tried to take the check which I had not addressed. He clearly wanted to free up the table...... Now mind you only three tables in the patio area including mine was occupied.  Servers need to understand that patrons want to get adequate service---you notice I didn't even mention the food---his bad attitude overshadowed my meal----the palm will be a miss on my next trip this spring. With so many options it seems that restaurants should offer their patrons polite patient service especially when there is no wait and no reason he should have been rushing me...",

Not a good thing. 6 people in our party had steak. All but one disappointed. No flavor, no presentation. 1 lamb, very fatty. Sides were good. No vibe in restaurant since remodel.

But it was too undercooked... He ordered it Medium, and it was definitely more on the rare side, he's a steak lover, and unfortunately he lost his appetite after trying to chew a few bites and only ate about 1/4 of it... Overall, everything was ok.. Just wished I loved it more... May have a better experience finding a steakhouse off the strip.   Otherwise, our server was attentive and friendly...",

I ordered a New York strip (a 12 ounce steak) and my wife got the 9 ounce filet.  We got an order of fries as a shared side.  The bread basket had a nice variety but I didn't want to fill up on that so I had two small slices of two kinds.  The steaks were both cooked perfectly.  Mine, blue, was cool and red on the inside--just perfect!  The fries were nicely seasoned although I didn't taste much garlic as I had expected.  For dessert, my wife had the seasonal berries and I went with the single size portion of carrot cake.  I would like to see the double portion for sharing just to see if it needs two people to carry it to the table.  Service was excellent!  Lopez was our server and he was very personable, polite, and efficient.  I never asked for an iced tea refill.  It was automatic.  Next time, we'll sit on the patio and watch the people walking by in the Forum Shops. We found that the air conditioning inside was quite cold and it was a bit warmer on the patio.",

I have eaten at the Palm chain over a dozen occasions in both NYC and Vegas but I must say this was by far the most memorable and even touching experience. The food was impeccable (go for the gigantic lobsters they have, come early and they will have an extra big for you) and the service too. There was a small hiccup in the beginning but both our server and the manager (Alissa) went above and beyond to not only make it right but to make it a very special dining experience.   While I have been here before, it was my parents' first time eating lobster. They have enjoyed it immensely and made a special remark about how impeccable the service was. My stepdad had his birthday and the chocolate cake with a candle, the special birthday table decor and the little hand-written birthday card were all an evidence of a restaurant that truly provides a wonderful, special, memorable and one-of-a-kind experience.   I can't thank everyone involved enough for the wonderful experience and will be sure to come back in the not so distant future.  Thank you!!!",

    "text": "Situated right in the forum shops is a NYC staple in Las Vegas, The Palm. The Palm is all about steaks and seafood. Or if you are like me and go for lunch the light salad options with some decadence on top. I had the Nova Scotia Lobster Salad, it was full of fresh greens, tomatoes, avocado and obviously lots of cold lobster. They certainly did not skimp and honestly for such a nice restaurant in a perfect location the price was surprisingly on point. If you are shopping in the Forum Shops or just looking for a good option that is better than a food court I would recommend stopping into The Palm.",

    "text": "As locals, my husband and I come here about once a month out of convenience when we're at the Forum Shops and hungry. Reservations are readily available on open table and we usually request Brian who is an excellent server. We also look forward to the 837 club special cocktails.   This past Sunday night we had reservations for 8:15pm. Brian was not in so we were seated with Shaunte.   Shaunte was fine, she very nice and she didn't disappear and was readily available but it almost seemed like she was new. We didn't get much of a greeting or a how are you doing. It was very straightforward to \"what can I get you\" which is fine. When she first asked what kind of waters we wanted I had assumed she was a food runner because she didn't introduce herself as our server.   We also felt a bit rushed. We ended up ordering different drinks since the 837 cocktail did not sound appealing to either one of us. I got a seasonal mule, my husband ordered a cucumber gimlet. Both drinks were good.   We skipped appetizers (the bread and butter is more than enough) and ordered two 9 ounce filets,  whipped potatoes, and creamed corn brulee. Now that I'm home I see I was charged for wild mushrooms instead of the potatoes but I'm pretty sure the price is the same for both so I'm not concerned.   One thing I've noticed consistently about The Palm is that steaks are ALWAYS over cooked. This time we ordered medium rare and they came out medium, a tiny bit longer and they would've been medium well.  We ordered them medium rare because we were looking for medium so I guess it worked this time.   All in all, it was fine. We came in at 8:15, we're finished by 8:52pm. There are so many choices in Vegas though. I don't know when we'll come back with our last few visits being so sub par.",

After wanting to try the palm for years im so happy we got to give it a try this last trip. We both split a 5lb lobster, and i added on an aged ribeye. Sides were ceasar, potatoes au gratin, brussles, and mushrooms. Desert was a creme brulee.    Holy shit wow...the service...the food...started with great service, offer of water, drinks, menu explanation and specials. Atmosphere was light, casual, and hip. Our table was immediatly graced by the asst general manager on shift. And visited frequently by bussers, waiters and management at every turn of the fork.    Ceasars csme after the bread, and were on point. With house made dressing. Then came the lobster..steak and sides...whoa..ive only seen bugs like this one in pictires. And need i say cooked perfectly? With butter for dipping, and a medium rare rib eye to boot...all sides were mouthwatering. My steak was perfect, and my claw was over a pound..so much mouth watering roe, i was amazed.   The drinks kept coming, and we were feeling pretty good and ready for desert. The salted caramel creme brulee was a decadant joy of taste to finish the meal with. I ordered a cappuccino with desert...i mean i cant do it justice...perfect in every way. We will be back...",

The salad, steaks and desserts are good but I prefer creamed spinach prepared simply with a bechamel sauce so their preparation isn't for me.  We ordered a giant lobster which was almost scary.  Obviously we realized it would be big but our large group was unable to finish it and it was somewhat undercooked.  Understable as it is so much bigger than the standard size but still disappointing.",

We were checked on often to make sure everything was perfect.  The food is also absolutely outstanding! The ahi tuna steak completely melted in my mouth. The taste was so savory, yet simple. I appreciated how it wasn't over-spiced.  The lobster Mac and cheese is absolutely and completely worth getting as a side! It is so cheesy and the lobster meat is so tender.  Kind of pricey but so worth the price for a nice dinner. The Palm is so perfect for a nice occasion- I even got a free cheesecake slice for my birthday!

My best friend decided to treat me to a dinner here for my 30th Birthday and I couldn't be any more pleased with the level of fantastic customer service and quality of food! We made reservations via opentable and arrived just a tad bit later than we put reserved and the hostess was more than understanding about it! Unlike most places, I was able to still be seated prior to my best friend arriving so I could start the ordering being that I was starving!  After being seated, our AMAZING sever Barry came over and gave us the run down about the menu and even made some great recommendations! I love when a server goes above and beyond to make sure I am happy and Barry did exactly that! We loved him!  Started out with some drinks that were concocted from the bartender featuring some whiskey and another round that had Jameson mixed with Coke! Yum!   Appetizer included a trio with Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Bacon-Wrapped Sea Scallops and Jumbo Shrimp. 5/5  Dinner Entree's:  5lb Broiled Jumbo Nova Scotia Lobster- 5/5  22oz Prime Bone-In Rib-Eye Steak- 5/5  22oz Prime Bone-In Rib-Eye Steak \"Oscar Style\" w/ melted blue cheese sauce - 5/5   Overall this was one of the best meals I've had and worth all $400 spent! What made it even more special was the fact that the manager came over personally to wish me a happy birthday AND took our picture to add it on The Palm Las Vegas Instagram page! Like what?! That was so awesome I will be back for SURE!",

Good thing we made a reservation because the mall was closed that night and you couldn't access any restaurant in the shoppes without checking in with security to confirm your reservation.

I had the lobster bisque, again, and it was pretty good, a little salty but the presentation was spot on.   SERVICE Laura, our server, was excellent. Waters were always full and drinks kept coming. She has been working there for 15 years, and it shows. She is on point despite the fact that it was super busy. She was very nice and I will request her section next time we go in.   WINE The Palm permits you to bring your own wine and their corkage free is really reasonable, only $35. Most places usually charge $50 in Vegas.   Overall, I highly recommend coming here and ask for Laura's section when you make your reservation.",

My husband and I have been regulars here for the last few years. We are absolutely obsessed with the food. I've had every single thing on the menu from appetizers to dessert. We like to sit at the bar because it's very comfortable, and since they did their beautiful renovation, you get a nice view of the restaurant while facing the Forum shops.   It's hard to say what my favorites are because this is one of the cases where I really and truly love everything. If I have to pick a few, I usually get the crab cocktail as a starter. It comes with huge pieces of king crab, and something called atomic horseradish, along with their in house cocktail sauce. Atomic horseradish is not for the faint of heart! I absolutely love spicy food, so it's definitely for me. But it comes with a warning from the bartender not to use that much until you get used to it. It's nothing like anything I've ever tasted!   Other favorites are the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio that comes with arugula, lemon, black pepper, olive oil and shaved parmigiano reggiano... so so good.   I love the Fried Calamari The portion is monstrous, it's always cuts perfection and never gummy or over chewy he comes with my favorite tomato (San Marzano) marinara sauce.  We almost always get the Baked Clams Casino or Oreganata, my husband's fav!   Once in a while, I'm in the mood for a salad, and when that moment arises, I get the \"Gigi\" Salad. It's huge chunks of chopped shrimp, green beans, tomato, onion, bacon, iceberg lettuce, roasted pepper, egg and avocado tossed in a garlic vinaigrette. A good tip is to order the salad dry, then ask for blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing on the side. Trust me on this one.   The steaks.. well they're perfect    I could literally write about every menu item and make this review longer than anybody would ever want to read. The bottom line is to try this place and say CJ and Nikki sent you! We go so much our picture is on the wall!   And I don't want to forget to add the amazing staff! Bartenders Derrick, Vic, Kelly are fabulous, and they're lead by Larry who is an amazing GM, and his AGM Savanna is one of the best restaurant managers in town!   Enjoy this place! It's my favorite!o",

Pio Bozzi and John Ganzi's original New York City steakhouse on Second Avenue has grown into a thriving empire of over 25 restaurants spanning the continent from Boston to Los Angeles. Chances are good you have sat at one of their white tablecloth covered tables to break bread with a business partner or a loved one. I was once a regular and 837 Club member of the downtown Denver location but my interest waned for similar reasons that will be explained below.   One area I have to tip my hat to The Palm is in their service: It is always world class without being pretentious and the Vegas location is no different. The service throughout the meal was legendary and the management should be proud of their staff as they set a professional bar for the industry. The service and environs really are spot on.   On to the not-so-great.  The biggest reason I stopped visiting the Denver location of The Palm presented itself again in Sin City; these guys just can't seem to get medium rare down. I ordered the 24-ounce Bone-In Ribeye at a formidable $52.00 a la carte and although it looked simply marvelous on the plate, as soon as I cut into the flesh I knew that the meat was cooked medium plus. My dining companion ordered the Filet Mignon also at a medium rare and the steak came out better suited for Tartare.   The tale of two steaks: One should have been served in an urn and the other could have been saved by a skilled veterinarian.   To the restaurant's credit, they handled the issue with class and professionalism by offering to fire up another steak immediately but time constraints did not make this possible so they simply struck the charges from the bill without hesitation. On a more positive note, the Au Gratin side was absolutely delicious and boasted copious amounts of sour cream, butter & cheese and - although health food it is not - it may be the best Au Gratin I have ever had.   In closing, I admire The Palm's way of finding the creme de la creme in servers and the fun atmosphere of their beautiful environs but I will probably consider them as a watering hole going forward as I still cannot seem to get a medium rare from any of their locations. There are just too many options for steak in Vegas to bother with an internal temperature crap shoot.",

They dont include a side anymore. I always get the half and half but now it has to be ordered separately for $9.99. Service took so long. We ordered Calamari appetizer. The size was great but the quality was not, its a little on the greasy side. Waited so long for my salad, and thereafter my steak and half and half. So disappointed with my half and half, it was so overcooked almost burned. Didnt even touch it. Sadly i wont be coming back to this place. On a side note about Ceasars palace. I have Platinum level on my credit card, valet my car at the forum shops. When i asked for my car i got billed for the parking  Apparently it does not say that forum shops is nor included in the free platinum level parking area. Argued with attendand that there was no sign whatsoever in the lot when i pulled in to valet. And i was told maybe you can make a suggestion with management. Very rude...",

Filet cooked perfect the mac and cheese was creamy and browned just enough to have a crispy crust.   Ended this meal with a tasting of key-lime pie , Chocolate pie and cheese cake.   All deserts were equally good.",

    "text": "We visited this steak house on Wednesday night with a party of ten, and had an overall good experience.  We ordered mutliple apps; a dozen bluepoint oysters (very tasty), Sesame crusted Ahi Tuna (excellent), Bacon Wrapped Scallops (excellent), Burrata (very good), and Sushito Peppers (meh).  Then we followed with a couple Caesars Salads (good), a Wedge Salad (great)  and Lobster Bisque (excellent).  The problem was, they brought out the apps and the soups/salads at the same time, creating a log jam of dishes on the table.  We followed those courses with Filet Mignons, NY Strips, Prime Double-Cut New York Strip (best steak of the night), Lamb Chops, and 2 large lobsters.  Unfortunately, 2 of the steaks were overcooked and were sent back (only the second time I've ever sent a steak back) and a couple of the Filets were a bit tough.  The lobsters were very good, with plenty of drawn butter.   They re-fired the steaks quickly, and took off a couple of the desserts, so they made it right.  The service was excellent, with the waiter really putting forth an effort.  Nice place to dine, but the issues kept them from 5 stars.",

I got the surf and turf combo with the 14 ounce filet mignon and half of a 3lb lobster (you can also pick a 4lb or 5lb lobster). The filet was the biggest one I've ever seen and succulent throughout and cooked to perfection at medium-rare. The lobster was huge and the table side cracking definitely made me feel pampered. I had to share my meal with a few friends since it was so ridiculously large, but it was money well spent. The total ended up being $95 with tax and tip.  My favorite part of the meal was the end where they squeeze fresh lemon in your hands and give you hot towels to wash yourself. Ahh Vegas, miss you already.",

I was here a couple weekends ago with my boyfriend and another couple.  Each of us couples had the lobster meal for 2.  It came with a HUGE lobster and 2 sides.  More than enough food!  And it was only $95.  Good deal to me!  We were stuffed by the end of the night and thought that it was well worth the money.  The best sides are the mushrooms and the cream of spinach (best I've ever tasted).  Again, please don't forget to order the bread (toasted), you will come back crawling for more.",

With the New York feel in a time when New York as the only place  you could fined a room with this much flavor. Seasoned with fun and tradition you can go back in time.  To enjoy a night out you pals for drinks and dinning. Everything is top of the line from the wait staff to the kitchen crew. Came as you are set and watch the parade of shopper as you relax on the porch and indulge one of the city's best steak. The New York strip was cooked perfect tender and juicy. A nice wine list and the bottle is  served correctly.  Well worth every penny and you will spend a bunch of penny's but you can't take it with you.

    "text": "My husband and I have been to Las Vegas many times and each time, despite all the fabulous buffets, restaurants etc, we always make time to dine at the Palm!  If you like Lobster, this is the place!!!  They do it right!  Our OUTSTANDING waiter, Israel (Izzy) knew from the start that we would all be ordering whole lobster.  He ran to the kitchen and brought out what had to be 7-10 pound live lobsters---4 of them---handed each one of us a lobster and took our pictures!!!  The dining crowd howled with laughter!!!  It was entertainment and dinner in one package!  We all loved it!  Then, three of us ordered 3 pound lobsters and my husband chose the Prix Fix menu with lobster tail and a filet.  For $50 you get appetizer, entree and desert.  Such a deal! If you are ordering a meal like we did, with lots of lobster, be careful not to order too many appetizers or sides.  My husband and I split the Palm salad, which was a very generous portion even halved! We also ordered the pancetta green beans, creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes for 4 of us. Way too much.  One side would have been plenty. And the bread basket is to die for, especially the brown bread.  Try, really try hard not to overdose on that stuff before dinner.  It is amazing.  LOBSTER. LOBSTER. LOBSTER.  Need I say it again?  It's like they put Maine in Nevada.  The lobster is done to perfection.  They bib you, butter you and bask you in the glory of perfectly done, pleasing to the palate and the stomach, LOBSTER.  Our one friend only ever eats lobster here.  I know why.    Our fabulous server, Izzy, comped us a HUMONGOUS 7 layer dark chocolate cake loaded with vanilla ice cream and lathered with whipped cream.  Even though all four of our tummies were full beyond full, with 4 spoons we ate that cake like we were on Death Row and it was our last dessert!    Make sure, when you go to Vegas, make a reservation in advance for The Palm.  It's located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.",

We sampled the following 5 items:  KOBE BEEF SLIDERS: bacon, lettuce, tomato and pesto aioli  FILET MIGNON CAPRI SANDWICHES: imported mozzarella di bufala, tomato and basil with a balsamic aioli  MINI BROILED CRAB CAKES: mango salsa and chipotle tartar sauce  VEAL PARMIGIANA SLIDERS  POINT JUDITH CALAMARI FRITTI: cornmeal dusted and tossed with lemon and cherry peppers  Overall the serving sizes were good, especially for the price. Our favorites were the filet mignon and kobe beef sliders, three per order. The veal parm was pretty tasty, but nothing special. The remaining two items were mediocre. The calamari batter was a bit too thick and soggy. The three mini crab cakes were very small and consisted of mostly filling and little meat.  When my wife, an unapologetic diet Coke fiend, ordered her favorite beverage, they brought her a diminutive 6oz bottle with a cup of ice. Now $3.50 for a small soda with no refills is pretty steep, but I guess that's where they make some money after giving you a good deal on the food.  Additional menu items which we did not try this time:  ULTIMATE CHICKEN STRIPS: panko and parmesan battered with sweet and sour chili sauce  PRIME CHEESE STEAK: prime New York steak, caramelized onions and Vermont cheddar cheese  OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL  JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL  Will we return? Probably, at some point. We'd like to try some of their other items, but we'll stick with our faves and ice water next time around.",

I mean every dish is intricate, flavorful, and robust. Their slider selection alone will keep you content for the rest of the evening. These aren't sliders, they're more like half-burgers, half-sandwiches. Seriously a big bang for your buck. You can't ever go wrong with fried calamari. And the fresh Oysters taste like the Gulf of Mexico minus the oil spill.   When I think of happy hour, I think siesta, people off work, relaxing, drinking, loving life. But the Palm really doesn't qualify as a Happy Hour kind of place. It's more touristy, hit and miss crowd because when it comes  to gambling, you either win big or you're down and out.  In our case, you have more down and out crowd with elevator music. And so it is, 4 stars.",

    "text": "Every time I go to Las Vegas, I like to try a new top rated steakhouse. I think I just found another one that belongs in my top 5 list. I just don't know where in the list I want to place it.   The Palm Steakhouse, in Caesar's Palace, appears just like a good ole New York steakhouse - dark wood decor, white-coated waiters bustling around focused on their business.  In reading the reviews here, some folks complained about lousy service, others were happy with their service. On this visit, my first, our server was wonderful. Attentive, happy to help with questions, and quick with our food.   But let's get to the meat of this review - literally. The steaks. AMAZING!!  The Palm takes a minimalist approach - very little seasoning goes on the steak. It's grilled to perfection, and served just as nature intended. Pure meat. This was some of the tastiest beef I've had in a long time. Clearly, their dry-aging works wonders for flavor.   I ordered the bone-in rib eye, and it was tasty, tender and had very little gristle. What a glorious piece of meat. My wife ordered the filet mignon. She likes this cut because of its less fatty make up, but in the end, even she liked mine better and ended up sharing with me.   We had drinks, they served some freshly baked bread slices with butter, and we had small fresh salads, but when I go to a steakhouse, for me, it's all about the meat.   I highly recommend you visit the The Palm at Caesar's Palace. It's now in my top 5, and likely to end up in your top 5 as well.",

Our server was very friendly and helpful. Overall great service from the entire staff. Decent wine selection to choose from. Great deal for 50$ for a salad of choice followed by an entree and dessert. He ordered the filet Oscar which was cooked perfectly. The pumpkin creme brulee was fantastic. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was delicious. Would definitely order it again. With the service being very \"hit and miss\".... Mainly miss in Vegas this was a very pleasant experience. Would recommend going to everyone. It was not overpriced either, many people on Yelp complain about prices, try McDonalds instead.",

We were promptly sat in the bar, which we requested, cause their booths looked super comfy!  My mom ordered a glass of wine and we each ordered the:  Louis \"Gigi\" Delmaestro Salad: shrimp, green beans, tomato, onion, bacon, iceberg lettuce, roasted pepper, egg and avocado tossed in a garlic vinaigrette.  The salad was light with lots of great flavors.  I could have used a tad more dressing but it was yummy!  The only down side:  $45 for lunch for two salads and ONE glass of wine.  Ummm... that seems pretty steep to me.  Side note: I've been to The Palm in other cities (even though they have closed most of them) and if you have room, definitely order the 7-layer carrot cake.  It's probably the best I have ever had!  You can buy The Palm cook book and they have the recipe in there, which is exactly what you get at the restaurant.  Very cool that they give you all of that info!    I would definitely head back, but probably for a couple glasses of wine and some appetizers.",

    "text": "We come to the palm every summer with friends to indulge in their lobster special. The special includes a salad, a 4 lb lobster and a side, to be shared,  all for $100. I always appreciate it when restaurant honors the reservation. We sat on the patio area which is excellent the people watching. We ordered the wedge salad to start. It's not officially part of the special but they were happy to give it to us. This has to be the best wedge I've ever had. It was huge and difficult to finish because of it's size. We ordered the lobster steamed. It came out cooked to perfection. They split the lobster for you at the table pulling the meat out of the shell. We were two couples so we ended up getting two sides. We ordered mushrooms and the creamed spinach. The sides were each excellent. Because it was our friends anniversary, they brought a huge piece of cheesecake for us to share. With four of us working on it, at the end of this meal, we could not finish the cake. My only gripe and the thing that stopped us from getting 5 stars was our waiter, Coyote, who appeared promptly when we sat down, disappeared for the rest of the night. There was a second waiter who was apparently in training he also disappeared for the entire night. The service for the evening was salvaged by an absolutely outstanding busboy who provided the service normally provided by the waiter. Unfortunately I did not get his name. If he had been our main server: this would have been a five star meal.",

    "text": "During our recent vay-kay in Vegas, we took my Pops to the Palms to celebrate father's day.  First time for me, and I'm not sure what number it was for my parents.  Needless to say, I'm very happy with the choice of making the reservation here to celebrate Father's day here with my folks.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and were greeted and seated right away.  Our server had a great sense of humor and was told that all items with the icon of the palm next to it was a signature dish.  He did not disappoint.  For appetizers we ordered the Colossal Lump Crabmeat Cocktail, which the parentals devoured like it was going to flee.  Not a morsel was left and the lettuce that surrounded the crab meat was tossed to ensure all pieces were found and eaten.  For dinner, Pops had the Double Cut Lamb Rib Chops 18 ounce with fresh mint sauce.  The lamb was cooked to medium perfection and was consumed with each bone cleaned complete - the fresh mint sauce was a winner, where another serving had to be requested.  Mom had the Signature Palm Surf 'n' Turf - a 6oz petite filet mignon and a half a lobster.  That lobster must've been a really huge lobster because the half she received was bigger than the size of my entire hand!  Needless to say she enjoyed it so much that there were no words exchanged, no grunts, just the sound of the silverware hitting the plate....then *poof* it was gone.  I had the Prime Bone-In Rib-Eye Steak 24 ounce (Hunk of Awesomeness) cooked perfectly at medium rare and the meat peeled off the bone like butter....I left no scraps and the only trace of evidence was the bone.  The sides we shared and recommend to anyone were the creamed spinach and the asparagus fritti (fried asparagus).  The creamed spinach is rich and similar to the ones they serve at the steakhouses such as Mortons and Wolfgang's.  But I totally enjoyed the asparagus fritti.  The asparagus was fried in a italian seasoned breading - not thick but very tasty.  Unfortunately by the end of the entrees there was no more room for dessert...though if there was, I definitely would have loved to try the flourless chocolate cake and New York Cheesecake....for the next time :)  It would have been embarrassing if they had to roll us out of the restaurant...lol.",

It was a normal Ceasar salad that had the perfect amount of dressing and croutons.  For our main dish we got the special, a seared halibut with 2 types of mushrooms. It was delicious and filling enough do two people! The waiter even graciously split the main dish into two plates. I thought that was especially generous and considerate. For a side we got garlic asparagus. The asparagus was also very yummy.  For dessert we got the chocolate cake. It was sooooo rich and delicious. Makes me drool even thinking of it!

The swordfish steak was solid. It was definitely fresh, but it was nothing special. It is not served with any sides so I ordered wild mushrooms as a side dish. I did not like these one bit...what a waste of 8 bux!   Overall, my meal was just okay. I do not plan on returning to the Palm Restaurant. I think it is overpriced for the quality of cuisine.",

    "text": "Oh man, if only I could do 2.5 stars here.  Let me explain:  I attended a bachelor party meal here with a large group of dudes.  13 to be exact.  While the food was very good (I had the crab cakes, everyone else had steak - but everyone said the steak was quality), there was a vital service error that I thought was handled the wrong way.  Let me first clearly state that my crab cakes were damn good, and so were the sides of green beans with pancetta and mashed potatoes.  The food was 4-stars-good, albeit overpriced.  Our waiter was a good guy and he did a good job overall, BUT... one guy's steak was either really overcooked or they just plain forgot it...I really can't remember which happened, but that is irrelevant.  Anyway, they told him they would get him a new one in just a few minutes.  They then came out and shot him straight saying that cooking a new steak at this point would take more than a few minutes.  They asked if he wanted something else that might cook a little faster, and the Victim stated he would take some crab cakes.  Here is where they went wrong.  They gave him a free drink for his troubles.  I don't know if this waiter had any control over this situation, but to me... with a group of 13 people at a special occasion like this, you should be getting that entree for free.  He didn't want crab cakes, he wanted steak... and they screwed up and there was no way for him to be eating his entree even close to the same time as the other 12 people at that table.  If you're at the level of pricing that a restaurant like this is ($36 for crab cakes, even more for the steak), there's a certain raised level of expectations for service - and they just weren't met here.  The bill for this meal was probably in the $1500-2000 range... they should've taken the $50 hit to make it right and give this guy his steak for free.  Maybe that just isn't done at places like this... I can't say I go to them regularly enough to gauge something like that.  No other complaints, the waiter was good overall... I just think The Great Steak Incident Of 2014 was handled all wrong.  I wouldn't eat there again, but that's because I wouldn't regularly pay $36 for crab cakes when I can go to In N Out burger for 8 bucks.  I'm a classy gentleman.",

When you go to a chain steakhouse, I think this is something what people should expect. It is well done for a chain steakhouse. I left the restaurant surprisingly more than satisfied.  Staffs here are wonderful! Also they have great summer deals such as $99 lobster for two with a starter and a side. I am not a big fan of lobster so it is not for me but I think the deal is great! My husband had a small lobster tail and it was very good! He enjoyed it very much.   My Chilean sea bass was just okay. It's not bad but nothing special. Crab cake was very good! I wish I had that as a main course. Very crabby!   Overall, the experience was great! We had a great time and ate too much!",

This time, however, it was a major step back.  Yelp was listing a new online special.  For $39.95, you get a salad, 9 oz. filet, and 2 sides.  Considering the normal 9 oz. filet is $42 a la carte, it is a great deal.  When we asked the waiter about it, he looked like we were speaking Portuguese.  \"What are you talking about?\", he said.  Really, dude?  You are going to play that way?  We laid out the details of the deal like we were talking to a child.  All of the sudden, he snapped back with, \"no substitutions, creamed spinach only\".  Oh, so now you remember the details??  We all ordered the specials, along with cocktails.  The service the rest of the night was not top-of-the-line.  The filets (and all of the food) were fantastic.  It's just disappointing to see the service lacking when you mention the word \"special\".",

    "text": "My husband and I dined at the Palm restaurant several times whenever we came into Las Vegas while we lived in San Diego. We always liked the food very much and the service was superb.  I haven't been there in a few yours but had dinner there yesterday with friends and the service and food have not changed-still superior.  We started out with a choice of Caesar salad or homemade beef barley soup. I chose the Caesar salad with an incredibly delicious rich creamy dressing. The lettuce was very crisp and the croutons fresh. Maureen and I had Tournedos of Filet Mignon and while I'm not particularly a fan of filet... I prefer a strip steak... this  was a fixed menu so the choices were salmon, chicken, or filet mignon. The filet was delicious,  very tender and perfectly done. The side of beautifully sauteed sweet onions and red bell peppers was absolutely out of this world and I intend to make that side dish at home several times now.  My other friends had the salmon which they said was nothing short of perfection.  No one left anything on their plate. Served family style were two huge platters of very thinly sliced potatoes and mounds, literally mounds of finely julienned fried onions. We couldn't stop eating them.  Dessert was New York style cheesecake or   thick slice of fudge chocolate cake with the accent on the fudge. So-so because it was not housemade and it was your typical assembly line bakery desserts. Not particularly impressive but good.  Service was superb as usual so no problem there either. I forgotten how good the Palm Restaurant is and how few people know about it. Give this one a try for sure.  It's located in the Caesars Forum  shops",

There always seems to be some sort of special going on. The previous month was a fantastic deal of their awesome 12oz prime beef burger, with toppings, for about $8! The month we went it was $80 for a 4lb lobster, split for two, with two sides and two starters, and a happy hour with sliders for a crazy low price. this time we went just for steaks and dropped almost $400 total on a steak dinner for two with a nice bottle of wine, starters, sides, desserts; huge portions, everything cooked perfectly.  Whenever you go you can expect great service, an incredible atmosphere (inside clubby steakhouse, outside people watching sidewalk cafe), and great food. No pomp here, this isn't a jacket and tie place (unless you want it to be). We've done Ramsay Steak, Delmonico's, and a few other fancy joints, but this is the one where I feel comfortable, and where I feel I am getting a fair deal and nobody is trying to rip me off (for example they just bring you nice cold tap water, no trying to upsell you bottled unless you ask for it).",

One of my pet peeves is having to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  If your restaurant is choosing to participate, embrace it.  Having to ask for the menu and having the server roll his eyes about it was almost enough for me to walk out on the spot.    Once we ordered and made our way through lunch, it was fine.  The food was good as was the service.    The highlight of the meal was the key lime pie.  It was awesome!",

I asked for a surprise of a drink from the menu I was disappointed when the waiter returned with a gin and tonic... Real original. Then onto the steak. The menu is not huge which is fine so you figure the few things they do have would be great. I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium. When I got the steak it was very well done with no sight of pink left. I called the waiter who then said hold on and grabbed the manager to come and look at it. I'm sorry do we really need the manager to come to my table to approve that yes my steak is way over cooked? So they brought me a new steak a few minutes later and the manager set it down and said I will wait while you cut into it to see that it is to your liking. A little awkward but okay. Plus that shows a lot of confidence in your cooks. So I cut it open and it was barely less cooked than before. By this time I was done wait sent the manager away so I could eat without being watched over.   So for $150 bucks (without tip) for 2 people I was far less than impressed with food or creativity of bartender. I can't say I would go back for the price.",

We both ordered the soup which was Manhattan Clam Chowder.  Very good flavor.  My husband got the filet medallions with mixed veggies and he said the meat was tender and had great flavor.  The veggies were a mix of celery, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and green beans. The veggies were cooked just a little bit, they were not overcooked like a lot of places. I ordered the fish of the day which was halibut in a mustard and caper sauce. Fish was cooked perfect, but my sauce had a skin on it like it had been sitting for awhile. The fish was hot on the inside. I'm thinking maybe mine was ready before my husband husband's?? Is still tasted good and I ordered it with mashed potatoes and they were so delicious that I took home the left over.  My husband got the cheesecake which he said was ok. Only ate a few bites. I got the flourless chocolate cake and I loved it. I didn't think it was too rich. Thought it was the perfect sweetness.  I plan on returning. I know my husband eats here often for work, so he's definitely returning. I think the $26 is a great value for everything you're getting.",

I just remembered I had my gift card to Palm's so we walk right in.\"  When you enter it's typical of a nice steak restaurant with big booths, nicely dressed older crowd, and lots of random photos of celebrities on the walls. What was particular about Palm was that they had tons of caricatures of the celebrities that have visited, and I'm not surprised at the vast diversity of celebs on their list. It is located within Caesar's Palace after all. We are seated into a booth that was a little to squished, yet weirdly comfortable. We ordered the calamari which was good, but nothing too special, however, the portions for the appetizer was big enough to feed 3-4 before the entree. Then, our steak. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth. We ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly with just enough red in the middle. My boyfriend and I were both sick to our bones, and they were kind enough to keep bringing hot water and lemon to our table. The waiter was friendly and casual, and checked up on us often.  The lasting impression? \"Great place to get a steak in Vegas.\"",

When we get to the restaurant, we asked about the restaurant week menu and was given a small menu with the $50 meal.  When asking about the other option, they said that was only available for lunch.  Odd, the website didn't specify that.  The waiter then asked if something was wrong, because everybody was asking about another menu.  After pointing out the details on the website, the waiter didn't know anything about it.  After all of this, the food wasn't all that special.

If you are in the Forum Shops and in the mood for pampering, GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!  5 STAR SERVICE!!!  i know i keep saying that....BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!  This ain't no outback...",

    "text": "Admittedly, the Palm was our second choice for Saturday lunch. Our rumbling tummies weren't going to let us wait out the hour long wait at Joe's Seafood Prime. The guys & I had tried the Palm in LA, so while we knew it was going to be excellent, we were also bummed about not trying those much raved about stone crab claws at Joe's.   A few of the guys, including my bf, ordered the $49 surf & turf (they chose steak & lobster, but I think there is a shrimp option.)   I had the business lunch, which was a three course meal for $24 (cheap cheap cheap!) I ordered: -caesar salad - side: half chips, half onion strings - filet tenderloins (cooked perfectly) - a flourless chocolate cake, which was thick & gooey (I rarely order chocolate cake, but the only other option for me was cheesecake & I definitely don't love cheesecake.)  - I stole a few bites of my bf's key lime pie which was equally tart & sweet. - crab cake appetizer ($20. my favorite crab cake of all the crab cakes I've tasted because they use lump crab meat.)  Our server was friendly & checked on us often. The busgirl (is that what you call a female busboy?!) was a little too chummy with my bf but that's ok...i understand, a girl's gotta work it for her tips! We ate on the patio where we could people watch. I am definitely a fan of the Palm!",

    "text": "Friends were in town so I was thinking of a good place to nosh on that was reasonable and near things they wanted to see/do.   Palms \"Prime Bites\" Happy Hour has been on my list for a long while. You can't beat $3.50 apps! Just a note- it's in the bar area only.   I tried:   Filet Mignon Capri Sandwiches, comes w/ 3- it was okay. The components are very fresh, but the bread got soggy fast with the fresh mozzarella sitting on it. I pulled out the ingredients and that some quality caprese.   Mini Broiled Crab cakes, comes w/3- pretty decent. It comes on top of a water cracker and comes with mango salsa and a tartar sauce. It had decent lumps of crab in it instead of pulverized minced.  \"Point Judith\" Calamari Fritti- can't go wrong with calamari, but it's not the best version I had. It needed a little bit more seasoning or a more flavorful dip than the tomato sauce.   Oysters on a half shell ($1 a shell)- lovely, very fresh. Don't know the variety, but these had a nice briny flavor to them. Horseradish was pretty mean which made me a happy oyster (eater).   Drinks aren't part of happy hour, but I tried the   Black Widow ($12) \"Muddled fresh mint, raspberries and handsqueezed lime juice, with Belvedere Black Raspberry Vodka, topped with Chandon Brut Classic, served up.\"- It was good, but did not grasp a hint of mint in there. I could tell the alcohols and tasted mostly the fresh raspberries swimming in my glass.   ( Sorry, no pics...it was too dark for my phone to catch)   Bar staff is friendly and attentive. They seem to enjoy their job and like to chat. They make sure to check on everyone periodically and did well considering the bar did not have a empty seat.   Overall impression- this is a definite great steal of a snack/meal. If you're a tourist, this is great opportunity for reasonably priced, quality food...I just think most tourist don't know about it.  I rarely go onto the strip so I can't say I'm coming just for HH on a regular, but once in a while I'll plan for a \"Prime Bites\" and shopping day.",

The shrimp Bruno appetizer was good...it had a mustard flavor to it, nice taste but something I could re create at home. The filet was good even though my boyfriend ordered medium and it was definitely medium rare,  my Sea Bass was awesome. The goat cheese potatoes were just ok... you couldn't really taste the goat cheese...my boyfriend thought they tasted more like butter. The green beans were way over cooked and hard to chew. We went last night(Halloween night) the place was steady. We sat inside the restaurant but closest to the patio area and our server was awful!! I think his name was Justin, he disappeared and was rude. I ordered a non alcohol drink and he gave us a nasty look and tone in his voice was so rude when I ordered it. The wait time for our food was long but not overly long to the point I was going to complain. I felt like our server was a union work and didn't care about his job just a sour attitude. I will probably try this place out again one day in hopes of a better experience.",

    "text": "I went for dinner on Saturday night, August 9th, with a group of about 12 guys for a Bachelor party. I was not the one who picked the restaurant, and when I first went online to read about it, I was a little nervous after reading some poor reviews.   We had reservations at 9pm, so I was already very hungry when we got there.  The restaurant did not look fancy and had caricatures on the wall.   I ordered a special they had where I got a 9unce filet mignon with lobster, and it was served with a soup or salad as well as a side. It was $59, which was kind of steep, but not all that much more than a steak by itself, especially if I were to order a side dish as well.  First the salad came. It was a mixed green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The dressing was simply awful. I do not know how you mess up a balsamic dressing, but it was really bad. Like I mentioned, I was hungry, so ate it anyway, although I commented to my cousin that it was really bad.   Then the steak and lobster came. I will include a picture.  It came with asparagus and I ordered the side of green beans. The green beans ended up at the other side of the table, but when I asked about my side dish they brought them over. Frankly, the green beans were the best item I ordered. That is disappointing for a STEAKhouse.  I expected something like a lobster tail, but instead there were random chunks of lobster, from the claw or whatever. I was disappointed.  Then I tried the steak. I asked for it to be cooked \"medium\" and it appeared pink on the inside. But the steak was VERY dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed, especially for a steak that cost $50. My cousin gave me a piece of his ribeye, which was cooked medium-rare, and it was much more juicy. I just don't like it that rare. I ate a few more bites of my steak, but it was tough to swallow. It came with Bearnaise sauce on the side, which I tried and did not like. I asked the waitress for some juice and she came with some au jus and some horseradish sauce. I put the juice on the steak, but it was very salty, almost like soy sauce. It made the steak easier to swallow, but did not help, and even hurt the already poor flavor. I was hungry, and upset I spent $59 on a crappy steak, so I ate it anyway. I could have made a big deal and sent it back, but there were 11 other guys who seemed happy enough with their meal and I didn't want to be the one guy who complained and slowed everybody down.  But I should have.   I thought of posting a negative review a few days ago, but thought I would call the steak house first, and tell them about my experience. Perhaps they would feel sorry and find a way to make it up to me. Perhaps they would give me a coupon or something I could use at another location, since there is another Palm steakhouse in Los Angeles.  I called on Tuesday and spoke to a server and hostess, who was very helpful, and asked questions about my dining experience, and took my information and said she would look up the ticket info and have a manager call me back shortly. She called me back later and said a manager would call later.  No call.  I called again on Wednesday and spoke to another gentleman, who was somewhat helpful, but didn't seem to know too much about the situation. He took my information and said I would get a call back later that night or perhaps the next day.  No call.  I called again on Thursday, today, and after being put on hold for several minutes, finally talked to a manager named LARRY.  He was exceptionally rude and did not care at all about my personal dining experience. He simply read me the notes about the dinner, telling me what I ordered (even if he made a few mistakes) and pointing out that I did not complain at the time and ate the food. He also pointed out how they gave us free cake at the end. Oh, I thought that was for the BACHELOR, and not just because I didn't like my steak. Sorry, we spent almost $900 plus tip, I think one piece of cake is okay. Side note- the cake was by far the best thing I ate at the restaurant. Skip the meal, just get the cake.  LARRY did not even apologize for my negative visit, and said he didn't know what else I wanted him to do. He did not even apologize for taking 2 days to talk to me (even if I had to call instead of him calling me back).   My meal was very unsatisfactory and LARRY the manager had terrible customer service.  I would absolutely NOT go back to this restaurant. I am not sure why we went to this place to begin with, as there are many other steakhouses in Las Vegas that would be much better.    I do NOT recommend The Palm to anyone. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!  *One side note I want to mention- our service at the restaurant was good. I do not have complaints about our waitress. She was nice and helpful and at least tried to make the meal taste better. I do not blame her for my poor experience. And I am quite impressed with the service of the rest of the staff after dealing with such an incompetent and rude manager.",

    "text": "I was very prepared to hate the \"new\" Palm.  After all, the Palm oozes tradition, old school dining experience and I've been eating at this location for more than 20 years.  When we stopped by earlier in the day to make our reservation the new lighting, elevated seating and open floor plan were nothing like the clubby atmosphere of the Palm of old.  But when we arrived for our 9pm reservation we were given a very nice half moon shaped booth that overlooks the entire restaurant.  I loved the new booths; they are intimate and acoustically designed so that even on the busiest and nosiest of nights you can easily hear your dinner companions. For dinner we started with the Hearts of Palm Salad (what else!).  Delicious as always.  We aren't big eaters so we split the 14 ounce fillet.  It came out on two plates, perfectly done and was excellent.  Many restaurants give you a dirty look if you split and entree.  I have never had that experience at the Palm.  For sides we had the creamed corn and au gratin potatoes.  Honestly, the creamed corn is the best I've ever had.  We had a nice bottle of Chardonnay, a Bennzinger, for only $40.  With tax and tip dinner was less than $200.  Not cheap but not expensive by current Vegas standards.  We are very happy that the Palm has reopened and despite our initial reservations, impressed with the new layout and look.  Excellent dining experience.",

Lobster Bisque, a caesar salad, a 4 lb lobster to share, a side of chips and onion strings. All outstanding along with super super service. All for on $99.. I love it. And a 7 layer cake with ice cream and whipped cream to top it off. Thank you so much.",

And the Sunday lobster special is fabulous. Be sure to try the half and half. It looks like a plate for 4 but one taste and you want to eat the whole thing by yourself!",

The starters (carpaccio of beef and calamari) were good, and the wine list gave us multiple choices of decent wines at restaurant prices. The main courses were all very good and desserts were decently sized and not overtly sweet.   However, the service was appalling. The waiter was inattentive the entire meal. We actually had to flag him down at one point with empty wine glasses and an empty bottle to get him to recognize that we needed to order another bottle. Our party of six was treated like an annoyance to a guy that had four entire tables to serve.   The atmosphere was noisier than expected with substantially more amplification of conversations than other locations.",

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we managed to squeeze in a dinner and lunch at the Palm.  We enjoyed both - especially the wonderful service.  You will never be addressed as \"you guys \" here.  Wine can be expensive but that seems to be the Las Vegas way.  For dinner I ordered the veal chop - a huge chop and perfectly grilled.  I think I liked our lunch even more than dinner.  Same great service but a super great bargain two course business lunch.   I ordered the skirt steak - actually two steaks with a huge plate of fried onions and chips and a small Caesars salad to start. At $22, this is a steal. I make skirts all the time and theirs was great!  I have one observation - not really a complaint - because Las Vegas has it's own idea of what is cool and what is not.    They hustle their guests - suggesting high priced wines by the bottle without a clue if you have any interest in ordering a bottle, a glass, or something else.  And if you order a glass they don't ask which size glass you want - they just bring the larger 9oz size.  In our case it ended up costing $78 for 2 glasses each. Not a big deal, but not what I would expect from a classy restaurant - even in Las Vegas.",

The steak was amazing and for $99.00 it fed the three of us and had leftovers for us to enjoy later. We had some issues with the wine list, they seemed to be out of everything that we wanted but the manager comped a couple of glasses of wine and removed one of the side dishes since we didn't like it.

It was clear that once we told the waitress we were eating light, she ignored us . It took 20 minutes to get salads and soups.  The shrimp salad was excellent. One of the best salads we have had. The food coming out of the kitchen for 20 minutes looked very tasty. If you plan to spend $100 a person for dinner and want tasty food, come here. Service seems to be linked to the amount of money you are willing to spend.  I'm not into the superficiality of money. I treat people the same no matter what $$ they are willing to spend.",

We were all going to order individual appetizers but our waiter suggested we get three of the triple appetizer towers.  That was a great choice, plenty of variety for all of us.  I even think we ordered a fourth.  All of us ordered some sort of steak or chop, all of which were cooked to perfection for every order.  I myself had the Rib-eye, fabulous as always.  This is the only steak i will ever order at the Palm. No other steakhouse can compare.  There was not one complaint about anyone's food.  Everyone was served basically at the same time, no one had to wait.  The food was without a doubt outstanding, and the service by our waiter Israel \"Izzy\" Ruelas and his serving assistants was exceptional beyond belief.  They truly made our dinning experience for my son's\"s bachelor party a memorable one that will not be forgotten. As an 837 club member from the original in New York this was outstanding.  You can take all of your celebrity TV chefs and put them aside.  They are not even in the same category with food or service that was experienced from our visit to The Palm. Again BRAVO Palm and Thank You Again. You rock Izzy",

While walking by, flirting with a waiter, the hostess knocked into my significant other's drink and it spilled on her.  You'd expect a sincere apology, but instead the hostess giggled like a child and walked away!  It was absurd.  A very kind bus boy immediately came to our aid, switched us to a dry table, etc, but the hostess never came back over to apologize.  It was incredibly unprofessional.  No manager ever came over.   If you want a classy place to have a delicious meal (whether it's steaks or seafood), there are no less than 10 places within half of mile of The Palm that have better food and better service.

My friends and I got a table and we ordered some yummy delicious appetizers and had multiple plates!  At $3.50 each, we were living it up!  Kobe beef sliders, calamari, crabcakes and sandwich.  We were full off their appetizers!  OMG, it was absolutely perfect!  A wonderful start to kick off the weekend. The place wasn't crowded and it's located right at the beginning of the Forum shops when you enter from the casinos.  It's the first restaurant on the left hand side with the indoor patio.  it seemed like we found a hidden gem right there on the strip!  We each had a glass of white wine, riesling, to pair with our appetizers.  Our wine was full price but absolutely worth it with the value of food we got.  This place is known for being a steakhouse but this review is based on our visit for their Happy Hour.  Let me just say... you have to sample their kobe beef sliders!  Yummy! The wait staff was adorable.  They were all so friendly and helpful any time we ordered additional appetizers, drinks or help with taking pictures of our group.  My friends told them it was my birthday and they came out and sang to me and brought a cheesecake slice with candle and additional forks to share.  They took pictures with me as well.  They really treated us well and took care of us.  If I am ever there Monday -Friday, I'd definitely hit up their Happy Hour.  I plan to go back and try out one of their steak dinners though too.   My final comments on this restaurant: GO!!!!",

    "text": "My family has been eating here every time we make a trip to Vegas since around 2007, when we made the diaspora from the south side of the strip to the north side (we had been eating at Gallagher's for as long as I can remember and my parents were looking for a new place that served slabs of beef on a plate in a dimly lit room)  We start out usually with the seared ahi tuna (which, in my opinion, is average, but well prepared), and more importantly, CLAMS; it's a must to order both clams casino and clams oreganata. Just thinking about them make my mouth water. Juicy, buttery, creamy, garlicky, and crunchy all packed into a little morsel of bottom-of-the-sea mussel gift from Poseidon himself. What's left on the plate is a swirl of oily golden nectar, perfect for taking Palm's fresh bread slices, seeping up the juices, and inserting it straight down your throat. It's hard to not get full before your tray-tray comes (that's what I call entrees)   I used to be a sole prime-rib-only type of child, but started eating filets when we began to frequent The Palm. The problem is that when you order a Palm filet (or any filet, for that matter), you really need to add sauce or reduction because there just isn't that much flavor to the cut of meat, it's all tender, melty goodness (which is far from a bad thing). More recently, I've been eating the ribeye which is just packed with delicious meaty goodness, like a cow jumped right into your mouth and rendered it's fat and juices right on your tongue. If you don't like my imagery, it's a nice, tender, and juicy cut of meat with excellent flavor, well seasoned.   The sides are a whole 'nother ball game, large and perfect for sharing. For a party of more than 3 people, it's necessary to order the three cheese potatoes (creamy, heavy, and perfect), wild mushrooms (earthy and garlicky), the hand cut french fries (crisp and golden brown with great seasoning), and I also get a baked potato for myself and myself only (the baked potato is an ordinary, oversized steakhouse potato, but it's always necessary for me to have one at a steakhouse, weird habit)  Now for zerts I've never gotten anything else from here for dessert other than their gazillion layer chocolate fudge cake. it's one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Moist, rich, dark, and sweet...it's incredibly difficult to finish when you eat everything that was mentioned above, but if you push yourself hard enough, you can finish it, and feel extremely guilty afterwards as you walk back to your hotel stuffed with hundreds of dollars of food in your belly thinking about all the hungry people in the world.",

It took us 40 minutes from the time we sat down at 1.15pm for lunch to get our steaks and the place was only a third full. But a three course lunch for $23 is ok by me for this quality. This location loses points for slow kitchen and oversalted bisque. L.A. location is good but busy. NYC is still the best but even busier.  The Palm is known for lobster and  New York cut. The prime rib is ok but sort of tasteless to my mind. For goodness sake, don't be one of these people who go to a steak and lobster house and order a sandwich. I can't vouch for the quality. Nobody does everything well. The Vegas location has one big plus going for it, it's not pretentious like the L.A. location.",

I even love driving by farms and cattle and watching them and anticipating end products of skirt steaks and cuts of prime rib and  bone in ribeye. Yes that's what I got. Becuase I love meat. Of all the places in the mall to eat. You would never expect  a great quality piece of cow in the Forum shops. It exists in the Palm Chophouse. Belive me the size made me quiver in my panties if I owned any. Just like any other steakhouse, everything is pretty a la carte. Some people won't admit to gluttony because it's a sin. Well. I live in Vegas. Sin City...and what happens here stays here. So screw it. I'm a sinner. Meat is good. Veggies with your meat will make you feel better about yourself. But overall yes expensive and you will pay for quality and nostalgia. It's a really cool experience given the wait staff is...well you'll see :)",

Actually, there were 3 good things about the lunch:  the Caesar salad was way above average, pretty much excellent.  The half bottle of a great Napa Cab was an unexpected gem on the wine list.  And my server was terrific.  The bad part was the chicken parmesan.  Okay, maybe I wasn't thinking right yesterday, and I shouldn't have gone to the Palm for anything but a steak.  But this chicken was so overcooked and bland, it more than brought down the better parts of the meal.  The half and half chips and onions were equally bland and lifeless, almost stale.  And of course the linguine served with the chicken was soggy--though the sauce was okay.  I had an excellent meal at the Palm II in NY last year, so I won't give up on them completely.  If only Rao's had been open at lunch yesterday . . .",

We each had the $49 surf & turf special, which was very high quality food, but a bit bland.  Service was pretty bad.  Our server was quite friendly and outgoing - with EVERY other table BUT ours.  I was willing to shell out $$$$$ for several glasses of wine with my meal, but it took so long to get glass #2, I didn't want to invest the time and ask for a third.  Once we were ready for the check, it took him about 20 minutes to return....seriously? NOT OK.  I will not return nor recommend.",

We ordered one of everything on the bar's HH menu and were pleasantly surprised by the decently sized portions and reasonable prices. Our favorites were the Crab Cakes, Veal, Kobe Sliders, and the Chicken Strips. Really the only one we weren't fond of was the Capri Filet Mignon. Cold steak doesn't really appeal to me. Our bar tender was excellent. She had a full bar top, was making the entire restaurants beverages and still had time to refill our rapidly disappearing waters (105 out that day). Next time maybe I'll splurge and go for the full meal deal!",

    "text": "Last week I visited Las Vegas-my friend and I decided we really wanted some good seafood. Upon pulling out my handy dandy Yelp app, we came across Palm. Granted, neither of us are under 21 but I guess we still look pretty young. We ordered a bottle of the Pinot Grigio. He automatically carded us. I guess I'm not at the age where I appreciate being carded yet.. especially at a very fancy, expensive restaurant. What did he think? That we were two 19 year old girls getting dressed up and wanting to spend over $100 each just to get some booze?! I found it to be pretty tasteless since usually nicer restaurants are not supposed to do that. The thing that made it the most tasteless was his sarcastic attitude.    We ordered our main course (filet with lobster tail) and calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was way too greasy for me and the marinara sauce it came with for dipping was very bland. My friend and I both agreed on this. The main dish was delicious, we split a filet and lobster tail.   Overall the positive for me was the main dish (it was a pretty small portion since we split it). The service and the appetizer were both very average. I realize that almost everywhere you go on the strip is going to be overpriced, but damn.. this place was really overpriced! After a bottle of wine, calamari appetizer, and one entree, we ended up spending about $115 each. I would not go back.",

We walked in at 10:15ish on a Friday night and were told the kitchen was closed.  Come on!  I asked them to serve us and found out that the kitchen was actually open, she just didn't want to serve us (she eventually warmed up).  I soon realized while trying to enjoy some food, that the staff hates their customers and endlessly bitches about people coming in late (but they were seated so the restaurant was obviously still open).  One server was so angry that a table kept ordering bottles of wine and food.  He'd rather go home 45 minutes (too) early than make a $100-$200 tip?  Silly boy.  The happy hour food menu was $5/dish and that's amazing!  We had 3 Angus sliders, 3 very high quality lobster sliders, and 3 crab cakes all for $15!!!! Wow!  The crab cakes were shamelessly small but still worth the price, burgers were good quality but nearly bite sized, and the lobster was fresh and tasted wonderful.  I'd go back if the timing was perfect, but I'll lower my expectations about the staff and their vocal chatter.  Too bad because this is The Palm, not some crappy chain restaurant.",

Only other complaint is the bacon wrapped scallop was slightly tough, but still wonderful. The shrimp appetizer was delicious down to the sauce. The crab cake possibly the best I've ever had, and I used to live in Baltimore, no fillers. My friend had the veal Marsala, said it was amazing. I had the ahi app as my main course, it was perfect and the wasabi was so fresh and spicy! We got the wild mushroom side, a little buttery for me but also very good.

The lobster bisque is an incredible way to start your meal and you will probably want to lick the bowl.  Fantastic selection of wines.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of fantastic side dishes.  I always expect them to be amazing but the description always makes them sound better than they are.  Skip the side dish and have the caesar salad, lobster bisque and lobster!! That's where it's at.",

Our server was so frantic, rushed, seemed annoyed by our presence, and had absolutely no input or anything to say about the menu or things that we were debating between.  His assistance was the only real saving grace for the service (wish I knew her name).  She was friendly, actually took the time to take a photo of us (the server would have not done this I'm sure), brought us additional bread, etc.  The atmosphere itself was completely chaotic with the staff racing around the restaurant like crazy people.  The noise volume was off the charts which made it hard to have conversation without feeling like we were shouting across the table.  It was definitely not what we expected.  The food was ok.  My filet was cooked perfectly and was delicious as a stand alone as the sauce I selected (brandy peppercorn) was salty and just plain gross.  The asparagus was bland and flavorless, the goat-cheese mashed were good although not off the charts, the mushrooms were disgusting - they were sent back.  The chicken parmesan was pretty good although it was covered in sauce and the presentation was lacking in most of the dishes.  If you want something mediocre at best, than it would be fine but it is not a restaurant that I would recommend and definitely won't be back.  There are so many amazing places to eat in Vegas and I'm seriously sorry we wasted one of our dining experiences here.",

    "text": "OK, this is my new favorite restaurant!  I've been dying to try this place for awhile, but I knew it was pricey.  Everytime I walk through the Caesars Forum Shops, I always glance over and then look away, not wanting to tempt myself but always saying, \"I want to try that place.\"  Tonight, I did.  The restaurant had a sign out front advertising some sort of happy hour menu, so I went inside to investigate.  They call it \"Prime Time,\" and it's a menu of 7 items normally priced around $10-$12, but from 5pm-7pm and 9pm-close those items are only $3.50!  I tried the filet mignon capri sandwiches per the bartender's recommendation, and they were delicious.  Three slider-style sandwiches on a bed of homemade potato chips.  The waitress also sold me on getting a couple of $2 shrimp cocktail, which were monstrous and I would say the best I have ever had.  Other items on the cheap-o menu include kobe beef sliders, \"ultimate\" chicken strips, mini broiled crab cakes, veal parmigiana sliders, \"Point Judith\" calamari fritti, and prime cheese steak.  They also have oysters on the half shell for $1 apiece.  Unfortunately, my appetite would not allow me to continue eating, but I promised the bartender that I'd be back.  Speaking of which, the service was fantastic.  The bartender's name was Jax, and she made up for the last few days of poor service I've been getting elsewhere.  I also signed up for their membership card -- it costs $25, and you get points for money spent at their restaurants.  When you sign up, they give you a $25 gift card, so it's essentially free, as long as you plan to come back a second time, which I definitely will.  The card apparently also gets you some sort of food specials, depending on when you come in.  I peeked at the full menu before leaving and all I remember seeing is the lobster for 2 special that's listed at the top of the Twitter page.  I thought it was a few dollars cheaper, but $90 for a 4 pound lobster, 2 salads, and a side.  When Restaurant Week is over, I'll be trying this one.  Did I mention that this is my new favorite restaurant, yet?",

    "text": "How do you describe perfection, excellence, and professionalism??!! That is exactly what you can expect from the Palm Restaurant in Las Vegas!  This is a True 5 star establishment!  My family and friends traveled from 4 different states to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday.  We chose the Palm Restaurant to host our daughters birthday celebration.  Before I give any details please keep in mind that the manager of the Palm Restaurant, Lawrence Close, kept a close eye on our party, making sure everything was perfect!! On a whim, the night before our reservation, I stopped by the restaurant around 6pm, to see if I could pre order some wines and appetizers that would be on the table when my guests arrived.  I was told to ask for Adrianna because she is the person who takes car of large parties.  Adrianna came down immediately and gave me her undivided attention!  I was so impressed!  I did not hake an appointment but she sat down and took the time to meet with me!  This was above and beyond as she had another engagement to attend to but still took the time to meet with me! By the way, Adrianna is phenomenal!  She knows the menu, and as a former wine director, knows her wine! She helped me choose delicious appetizers and affordable wines to have on the table when my guests arrived! Her suggestions were phenomenal!!  The wine and apps were amazing!  We had oysters orenganata, clams casino, scallops wrapped in bacon, and the fried calamari. All were spectacular!! The clams were phenomenal! The calamari was so good, not bready at all, just a light coating that was delicious! BTW...the marinara that accompanies the calamari is soo good!  We asked for an extra serving:)!     Our wine was 5 star!  We started with Prosecco to make a birthday toast.  I loved what Adrianna suggested! Our red wine was Dona Paula Malbec, and our white was Winter Hill Sauvignon Blanc.  Both were excellent and paired perfectly with our food! Before I go on, I need to recognize our server Elaina!! She was THE BEST!!  She has been with the Palm Restaurant for 14 years and knows exactly how to run a perfect party!  She knew what time to bring each app, salad, entree, and dessert!  She also timed drinks perfectly with the food!  She is definitely  the server to ask for!!  The dinner was beyond exceptional! My daughter and I split the 6 pound lobster! It was phenomenal!  The lobster was from Nova Scotia and was excellent! Very tender and so sweet!!  The men ordered steaks which they are still raving about!! We ordered all of the sides, creamed spinach, wild mushrooms, mashed potatoes with cheese, and brussels sprouts.  I spoke to my niece earlier and she was still raving about the sides! They were just that good!!  When it came time for dessert our wonderful waitress Elaina, brought out an enormous piece of chocolate layer cake with a candle on it for my daughter! We all sang happy birthday and willingly helped the birthday girl eat the delicious cake!  The attentive and professional manager, Lawrence  Close continually monitored our party making sure we were raving fans - which we were!! I can't say enough good things about my experience at the Palms Restaurant!!! The food and drinks were amazing!  The customer service from the manager and staff were the best I have experienced!  I compare them with my visits to Peter Lugers, Capitol Grille, Smith and Wollenskys!  The Palm Restaurant was superior in every way!!    It was wonderful  seeing the smile on my daughters face!!! Knowing that every person in our party was a raving fan of the Palm Restaurant tells us that this restaurant truly earned all 5 stars!!  Thank you again Lawrence Close!!!",

After telling the server, she offered to rectify it with a free coffee... Which was slightly more flavorful than water... Then brought a $200 lunch bill to the table.   Would never go back... Go to Prime at Bellagio or Capital Grill.",

My hubby took me here when he was trying to impress me and I was SOO craving Lobster. He kept raving about the steaks here, but I my first Love is Seafood particularly Lobster and then steak.  Well I had some other things here and he had the steak, which I remember tasting delicious, but the One thing I do still dream about was the fresh 6 lb lobster.  Yes I did say 6 lb Lobster.  We got there a little late and we asked about their lobsters, they said the smaller ones were all gone.  Let me tell you, I ATE Every Morsel of that heavenly seafood God.. MMM..MMM..MMM.. so foodgasmic!  And the cost of $120 for it was WELL DAM WORTH IT!...Now will my hubby be taking me out there for lobster again?..Heck No..Thank god I was able to experience this when I did, because these days our budget eatings cut in half..lol",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with this restaurant and for the first time let down by reviews for this restaurant. The ambiance was very nice, but our waiter, an older gentlemen I was expecting to be a pro, first let my husband and I down by only telling us of their summer lobster special was that it would save us $50. We love lobster, but decided against it thinking it would be a whole lobster we would have to break apart ourselves (let's just say the last place I ordered a whole lobster turned into an extremely messy and unpleasant affair). However, as we waited for a very long time for our beverages to arrive, we watched waiters bringing food to nearby tables and saw the lobster special. It was already split and the waiter even broke apart the rest of the lobster for you and took away the shells upon service of your food. We were a little mad our waiter did not tell us this, it would have been a selling point for us. Anyway, as a starter I ordered a Garden Salad with the Garlic Vinaigrette on the side, which was really pure oil, not even good tasting extra virgin olive oil.... It made me upset to my stomach. As an entree, I had the broiled crab cakes, which were okay. My husband had a steak, he also thought was okay, but after having a steak at the Mesa Grill the previous night he thought his steak at Palm did not compare. Overall, this was not a good experience especially, for the cost of the meal.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to the Palm. Having visited there before it has been a place for melt in your mouth steaks.This time was a huge let down. The calamari was overcooked and bland, I had to salt it. I planned on ordering the 9 oz. filet but the waiter told us it was \"Restaurant Week\" and we had a few options. I chose the Palm salad and filet with bearnaise sauce with crab meat. A dinner guest ordered the lobster bisque as his starter.  I of course had to try the bisque because they have one of the yummiest. Well this one was barely warm and not the bisque I've had in the past. It tasted pre-made, like they order it frozen and reheat. The crab on my steak was cold and fishy, my steak was chewy even though it was cooked perfectly. We didn't visit there because it was restaurant week, we just thought the special offer sounded great. I mean if they're going to cut corners they should serve a smaller steak instead of mediocre everything. I would have gladly paid 43$ for a great steak instead of 39.95 for what's supposed to be the same steak with sauce on it.  I also had to salt everything. I never salt my food. So Palm, you were a let down and I don't know if I'll visit next time I'm in town with so many new places to choose from.",

I really enjoyed the bread (yes, i know it's free, but it's important) and the mashed potatoes and the mushroom sides were out of this world yummy yummy yummy.  The service was very good - the waiter was nice and helpful, he cut up our steak in two and brought it on separate plates (since we were splitting).  We ordered only one glass of wine, trying to keep the price down, but it was brought out in a little decanter and was enough for two full glasses - it worked out great!  The only thing - our steak was a bit overcooked (16oz sirloin at $40), but that maybe because they misunderstood our desire for medium as a medium well....  The clams oregano were a bit too oily and bread crumby.  In general, it was a good experience with large portions. (Price: $100 approx for one glass of wine, appetizer, $40 steak entree, 2 sides)",

The food was good. I had the sea bass, which I don't normally do at a steak house but I had had a big lunch. The sea bass was good, slightly on the bland side. The steak oscar which I think was a special and included a steak and lobster was awesome from what I hear. Bites were shared and all agreed it was delicious. The sides were good, nothing really stood out. What did stand out were the desserts. The carrot cake was off the charts from what I'm told. I didn't try that one because I had my hands full with the chocolate cake. This thing looked like rich top soil, it was so dark. The serving size was HUGE. The table of some 12 ordered one carrot cake and one chocolate cake to share and we couldn't finish either even though they were spectacular. I think I could have mustered up the courage to finish the chocolate cake but I didn't want to go into a food coma. The chocolate cake is very moist and nearly melts in your mouth with deliciousness.",

This felt like eating at a food court to me, so I was in kind of a strange mood, but I decided to be open minded.  Two dirty martinis helped me lighten up a good bit, so once the food started coming around I was a very happy fellow.  I ordered a Monday Night Salad, which, for what I paid for it should have been better; it was average at best.  When the meal finally came out, I was basically in glutton heaven.  We ordered (for a table of 4), a 6 lb. lobster and a bone-in rib-eye with three sides (three-cheese potatoes, creamed spinach, and brussel sprouts served with lobster in a madeira wine sauce).  The lobster was phenomenal and they left the roe in the body cavity so that made it that much more decadent!  The steak was good, but came out a bit cooler than I had hoped for.  The sides, well, you read the description earlier; they were flavorful and heavy and terrible for me, but delicious.  After that meal I needed a nap, but we sat and I finished my big glass of wine while my crazy father ordered dessert!  The food here is nothing revolutionary, but it comes in big portions and is very tasty.  Maybe not worth the bill at the end, but I had a nice time, so put a price-tag on that!",

We both ordered a $22 lunch deal that included a steak, side and a salad. I was definitely a good deal for the food included. I ate the skirt steak that tasted like more of a Latin preparation with onions and peppers than an American steakhouse.  It came with an avocado which felt like an odd combination, but it worked. I enjoyed it. We chose the Brussels sprouts and half and half potatoes as our sides. The vegetables were great, but the potatoes looked like fried potato scraps and chips. Nothing special or appetizing about it. The restaurant definitely has an old school feel. The service was good, but slow. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but if you're in the area or shopping at the Forums, it seems like a reliable choice.",

They don't however bestow any awards for those who attempt to eat directly from their plate, as if in a pie eating contest. But then they don't throw you out either.  I know this after two successive years of waking up the next morning with garlic mashed potatoes in my hair and eyebrows.  If you dine here, and perchance exceed the 10mg suggested dose for marijuana edibles just a skosh, say by 200 mg, don't ask to be seated on the patio. In fact don't ask to be seated anywhere.  Get back to your hotel room post-haste and enjoy the total body paralysis that WILL be your weekend. I think that's why management didn't boot me. They probably got a good laugh out of all the Forum Shops passersby who laughed at my potato coiffe.  My friends loved the experience, said the service and food was excellent.  Especially my buddy, the one whose picture is on the wall in the bar area.  I do recall that much - laughing at the size of his teeth until I Chris Reev'd out.  I'm going to have a damned good talk with my neighbor who gave me the edibles. Apparently, his cancer is no match for my sciatica.  PS. I did find a petite filet (9 oz) in my cargo shorts the next day. It was cooked Pittsburgh style absolutely perfectly.  Big shout out to the chef, and to a lesser extent, Polo.",

This past Vegas trip (Oct. 2013) me and the boyfriend decided to branch away from the group of 15 we were with and do a date night at Cesar's Palace since it was close to our hotel (The Palazzo) and after numerous restaurant suggestions from my girlfriend Mochi who lives there, I ended up choosing The Palm restaurant located in Cesar's Palace right in the beginning of the Forum shops. We made reservations through open table and got a table within 45 minutes of booking it.   The place is kind of loud so we opted to sit outside where it was a lot quieter and a nicer view. We both weren't that hungry so we decided to share a salad and an entree.  What I love about this place: 1.) The Chilean sea bass ($37) 2.) Mixed green salad ($11.50) 3.) The ambiance 4.) Workers 5.) THE FREE BREAD they give and whip butter (I had to ask our waiter twice to refill our basket---especially with the sweet raisin cinnamon bread)  Don't be like us and forget to use your rewards card for points and discount!",

We sat out on the patio (which I highly suggest), because it makes for great people watching in a place that is known for attracting nearly all walks of life.   The service at Palm Restaurant was excellent. We had an older either Russian or Italian server, and unlike a lot of other fine-ish dining resturants where a bus boys ends up being the one serving the table, he was very attentive the entire time and knew the menu like the back of his hand.   I was with three friends and we ordered three salads and split the three-pound lobster. The salads were pretty average (I mean really, how can you get that crafty with a salad) and the lobster was just ok too, however it did feed all of us comfortably.   Having been spoiled with some really fresh seafood in my lifetime, I will say this lobster wasn't the freshest thing I've ever tasted. While it did taste good, it was lacking that just-out-of-the-ocean taste that food at some other seafood restaurants has.  Overall, the Palm serves average food with great service at a high price point. With the competition for dining in Vegas, it's like Yelp says, A-OK.",

I had the 14 oz filet mignon, good but not wow her's was better...think I'm a NY strip man for a while.  Had my filet oscar style with crab meat, asparagus and hollandaise sauce. Sauce just ok, crab meat good not great not \"fresh\" asparagus was average.  All in all 3.5 but rounding up because it's Christmas lol. LA location made for better food and more memorable experience.  $187 with tip...I expected a ill bit more... Again 3.5 but rounding up and thus not posting a 3 star review...",

There was a party going on in one of the private rooms. They took our order and it went downhill from there. It seemed the entire time as if they had something better to do. One person's order came out wrong, they never checked on us, refilled wine, they just left us there. The food for what we paid for it was just meh. I've had way better. They knew they were separating the checks, gratuity was added (as usual for such a large group) but somehow they added the entire gratuity to one person's check, but no gratuity was added to our check. When we questioned it they got upset. They even went as far as to ask one of the people in the party if that was all they were going to tip! But they did take our checks back and fix it (I think, the jury is still out on that one). We left and made it all the way down to where Smashburger and Starbucks was and a waiter chased me down yelling my name asking me if we paid! Yes, not only had we paid, but also my husband tipped on top of the added gratuity. I told them they had been paid plenty. I will never return. I have had far better food and service in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "What's a Vegas trip without stopping by a great steakhouse by the forum shops at Caesars?! Usually we try and switch it up with other restaurants in the area as we tend to stay at Caesars the few times we go every year. This past time we decided to try out this place other guests were raving about.    We started with the \"Monday Night Salad\". With the right amount of anchovies and roasted red peppers with a nice creamy bleu cheese dressing this salad was a hit amongst the other patrons at the table. Other people in our party got the Caesar salad which they seemed to enjoy as well and we're happy the anchovies came on the side.   For another appetizer, we elected to get two lobsters for the table to share. The server explained they were 3 lb. freshly broiled Nova Scotia lobsters. I felt these would have been very good however, they may have been broiled a tad too long leaving the inside a little dry. Still good nevertheless but could have been great! Would like to try this again next time we visit and give this item another chance.  Steaks were all very good. Sides excellent. All patrons in party pleased and stuffed! Had to walk around the casino a couple times to digest. Will definitely be back in the upcoming year.",

    "text": "Ruben and I joined another fun couple to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu tonight. We sat inside and ordered drinks to start. I had the PALM REFRESH (vodka, muddled basil, etc) and it was tasty and refreshing (haha)!   After looking at the menus, we asked our server for the Restaurant Week menu. He not only proceeded to look at me like I was crazy, but actually said, \"What are you talking about??? What is that? What are you saying?\" Not sure why he got so upset. So, instead of continuing this frustrating discussion, I started to bring the page up on my phone. Our friend, Diana, ended up asking the young lady that brought our water and fortunately, she knew exactly what we were talking about and graciously brought us menus. No apologies from our server. He seemed really confused about a lot of things and was also argumentative, absentminded, and not entirely friendly. We tried joking with him to lighten the mood or to show that we had forgiven his prior offenses, but it didn't do much.  We all did the RW prie fixe and an order of CALAMARI FRITTI. The portion was extremely generous! The calamari was not fresh and completely lacked in flavor though. I think it was served with marinara and it was not good. For the first course, Ruben got the LOBSTER BISQUE and it was all right, just unfortunately salty. I chose the ROASTED BEET AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD; the beets were nice and overall, the salad was good, however, the goat cheese was just okay and the arugula was weighed down by the amount of dressing.  I ordered the FILET MIGNON, single cut served with Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes and Wild Mushroom & Black Truffle Demi as my second course. The filet was dry and not flavorful; I also ordered medium rare and it obviously wasn't. The whipped potatoes were really delicious and the Demi was good. Ruben had the CHICKEN PARMIGIANA; the Linguine Marinara was good - cooked perfectly al dente, simple sauce, and fresh basil, however, the chicken was disappointing.  For dessert, everyone chose the NEW YORK STYLE CHEESECAKE and I chose the KEY LIME PIE. They were both really great! The cheesecake was light, crumbly, not too dense, the crust was wonderful, and I loved the compote with it. Perfect. The key lime pie wasn't overly tart, same wonderful crust, great flavor. Nice berry compote too.  The good: generous portions, dessert. The bad: service, food quality and overall taste. I'd rather pay more money for better food, so the plate sizes are a petty matter and comparatively, there are much better Italian restaurants (Ferraro's!) and Steakhouses in town. Also, let your servers know when you're participating in a week-long event as to avoid an awkward situation with your patrons!",

This steakhouse is obviously very famous and has a great location near the entrance to the Forum Shops from the casino at Caesars.  If I had to give one tip, it would be not to forget about this place for lunch.  Excellent burgers, I'm partial to blue cheese, which is of excellent quality here.  It's more expensive than other lunches, but it's certainly worth it.  At dinner, the wine list is solid, but certainly not the best on the strip.  The crabcake is solid.  The chipotle tartar sauce is a welcome departure from the usual sauce.  It has a nice flavor with some kick, but certainly not too much.  Potatoes au gratin probably our favorite side.  The steaks are all prime.  You don't need a sauce, but the best one I've had here is the brandy peppercorn.  Neither ingredient is overpowering, but both are certainly there.  It's a nice achievement.  I request that you order fried onions to eat with your steak.  They are very thin and the juice from the steak soaks into the onions, which brings the two together.  Every lobster we've ordered here has been perfectly prepared, hot and tender.    In the end, it's not a cheap meal, but it's very good quality and you won't regret it.",

Last year we were waited on by Barry (and I meant to post something a year ago but never got around to it).  This year we were waited on by Ruan (I hope I have his name right- energetic man from Brazil).  Both waiters read our group right and made perfect suggestions.  They were knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive.    We like to mix it up every year and try new places.  This restaurant is always at the top of the list, and honestly, better than high end places at the Venetian and other high end hotels.  Next year's stay in Vegas will include a trip to the Palm.  We hope to see Barry or Ruan again, but I'm sure we will be pleased with any of the staff.",

    "text": "The Two Stars are for the servers that try their best.  This used to be my favorite place for all special occasions. Not anymore.  I went their for my birthday, as they gave a free lobster dinner. The old saying, \"A Free Meal Tastes Better\" , only applies to a cheap acquaintance, not me.   The Lobster, that my wife shared, was very sad. Their special, a Bone in Filet, was Sizzler Quality, not worth the $60, not worth half the price.   The Bread Basket is still one of the best in town. That's about it.   It is obvious that this place has either gone \"corporate\", or just like most Las Vegas places on the Strip, does not care about repeat business, and certainly could care less about locals.  The last draw was when I wanted to have a special dinner, after my wedding ceremony.  We walked in on President's Day, and were told the person in charge of Banquets was off, and only she had the schedule. Holiday, fair enough.  The next day I called, and no reply. I called the manager, he couldn't help me. I did not get a call back for four days, by which time, I chose another place.  The only reason I am not sending a nasty letter to Corporate is because, first, it will do no good. Second, they will still send me a free lobster dinner for my birthday, and I will give it to my son, to impress some girl.  Here's what sums up my feeling;  My sister gave us a $200 Palm Gift Card for a wedding gift. I told my wife to take her friends there.   NO way will I ever eat there again!!!!!  Try Del Frisco's. Much better quality and value, and they want your business.   These folks could care less.",

From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave, you feel valued and appreciated for your patronage while you feast and imbibe on delicacies that are unparalleled in terms of quality and flavor.  While the fare is delectable, the staff is what sets this place apart. We've been coming here for years, and lately we've noticed an uptick in overall experience. It turns out the reason for that is Michael, the GM. This man is uncompromising and exudes professionalism. He insists that his customers leave happy, every time, and maintains only the highest standards both in the kitchen and on the floor.   Servers like Barry (Barry \"Smiles\"), are the beating heart of this establishment and the reason why my wife and I are loyal customers for life. Barry makes the entire dining experience an absolute joy; ensuring your every need is met, and doing so with the humor and attention to detail that makes him truly unforgettable and someone you insist your friends and family go visit. You leave just wanting Barry to be your new best friend.   We also met Luigi, the floor manager, for the first time last night, and he perfectly upheld the incredibly high standards that the Palm maintains.   I cannot speak highly enough about the Palm, it's offerings, and especially it's incredible staff.   If you're in Las Vegas, you're doing yourself a huge disfavor if you don't dine at the Palm. Ask to sit in Barrys section, if available. You'll be grateful you did.",

Baked clams for an appetizer was a disappointment, the clams were the smallest I've seen and the bacon on top was burnt. I was debating between the Chilean Sea Bass and the lobster and opted for the Chilean Sea Bass as recommended by our server.  The Sea Bass was bland and needed more flavor and the  butternut squash risotto that came with the entree was nothing special. My husbands bone in ribeye was tasty so I ate most of his instead. Cheesecake for dessert was delish! I've heard their known for their lobster so we'll need to try that next time!",

We sat at the bar and had a drink at the bar first while we waited for our friends to arrive . I ordered a cosmo and my boyfriend ordered a manhattan. Both were made well. We were seated in a booth for dinner and it was quiet and comfortable. We ordered the lump crab meat cocktail and scallops for appetizers. The perfect amount for 4 adults. The appetizers were spot on. Next my boyfriend and I shared a Caesar salad. For dinner our friends order the 4 lb lobster to share.   We had a sample of it and it melted in my mouth. My boyfriend and I shared a 12 oz filet, medium. It was a little over cooked, which we were hoping for. It was so juicy. We ordered the asparagus and hash browns for sides to share. The hash browns were AMAZING! For dessert, my boyfriend and I ordered a key lime pie And cappuccino to share. This was also so good. Everything was delicious. The service was great. The ambiance was great. I definitely recommend that you have dinner at Palm restaurant.",

I went with the 12 oz Wagyu ribeye w/ lobster truffle butter. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is a steak lover. The lobster mac & cheese was also a winner, very smokey flavor too it. Service was great as well can't complain about anything.",

    "text": "I've dined at The Palm three times now and each time I have experienced a problem with my order. What makes it worse is that it has been the SAME issue.   The first time I ordered their steak tenderloin sandwich which is supposed to have a sriracha aioli sauce. It took a couple of bites to realize they took it upon themselves to substitute the aioli for horseradish. Once I brought it to their attention, they waitress was great and got me a new one quickly and it was delicious.  I liked the sandwich so much that I ordered it again on the second visit. Again, they substituted the aioli for horseradish without telling me. This waiter however, argued a little bit before replacing it.  I visited again today and wanted the same sandwich but I made them aware of my previous issues beforehand to try and avoid it altogether. The waiter said no problem, there will be no horseradish this time. The food arrives and no horseradish but also no aioli. When I asked my waiter to bring some, he said the chef had ran out and they brought me a side of straight up sriracha from the bottle instead. No apology, just made it seem like it was my problem that an ingredient listed on the menu was out.   In case it's not clear, I'm not asking for anything special here, I literally just wanted exactly what is written on the menu and all three times ran into an issue. I even let the manager know after the second visit that there must be some disconnect between the kitchen and the menu.  When they get it right, this place is fire, but for me, I think the three strike rule applies and I'm out.",

    "text": "I took my wife to the Palms Restaurant after watching a Cirque du Soleil show. Since we were heading in the Caesar's Palace direction anyway, figured we should try something besides Spago out.  It oozed quality the minute you got in and were met by the maitre d'hotel and checked our coats in. It wasn't busy when we arrived and they found us a table straight away. Nicely furnished and relaxing atmosphere. Interesting walls, where they have picture/cartoon paintings of all the famous people who have eaten in the restaurant.   The waiter brought us over the beers we had asked for and the menus. Food on the menu is pricey, so much so that I was scared to look at what the beer was costing. We decided to start with a Caesar Salad with a vinaigrette sauce and, much as I don't do rabbit food, I almost ate all of it by myself!  We both went for the 14oz Filet Mignon with the lobster add-on, with all the side dishes (mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) we wanted. What I didn't expect them to do was bring the love lobster out to us to see what the before and after would look like! We thought it was funny that they let us hold it up to take pictures of.   Anyway, the steak and lobster were cooked exactly the way I wanted. The sauce and the side dishes were excellent too.  We were offered dessert, when they brought over a big tray showing what was available, but neither of us were up for eating any more. my mate though asked for one of the huge portions of carrot cake to be put in a takeaway box to take home for his wife.  So the downside is that it's not cheap! (But what good restaurant in Vegas is?) If you can afford it, the Palms is a great place to go. Most satisfying meal I've had in ages!",

However, I am a fan of Martini's and yours sadly are among the lower percentile. In no particular order:  1.  The size of the drink is always different.  I ordered a Martini straight up on Thanksgiving and it was half full.  My wife even commented, \"strange place to save some money\". 2.  The cocktail is never properly strained.  You mostly feel like you are drinking icebergs. 3.  NO VERMOUTH IS NO VERMOUTH.   4.  Very warm when the drink gets to the table.  Palm folk, the martini is an iconic drink and needs to be treated with respect.  It is the start of the meal and starting dinner with a bad martini is like going to bed with you wife while she is mad at you.  Thanks for listening!",

Expected something out of the ordinary or exquisite for that price of salmon/ veal dinner we had. Husband said veal was super thin and covered in so much marinara and cheese that you could not even taste the veal anymore. Menu says the fish is cooked within hours of being caught, but my sauteed salmon was a little tough at the top which led me to believe that it was not as fresh as advertised or we're talking more than several days at least. I believe I could have gotten the same if not better at TGI Fridays. Also they piecemeal the dinner so none of the sides come with that heavily priced main entree. Each side is about 15 bucks to go with your 50$ entree. I just don't think the meal was worth that price and I would have had the same if not better tasting meal at red lobster or this Friday's. Fresh cloth dinner napkin on table was soiled and had previously been used. We set it aside. Staff was nice",

    "text": "This is a hard review to write. Over the years I have had excellent dinners at the Palm.  Whether it was the Palm in NYC, Chicago or Orlando it has ALWAYS been a great experience.  Tonight, could simply have been one of the worst experiences from beginning to end.    We started with drinks in the bar and we should have left when the bartender didn't know how to make a dark and stormy.  The drinks arrived almost clear.  We asked if they were out of Gosslings or some dark rum and the bartender responded with \"Was I suppose to use dark rum?  I thought I was suppose to.\"  And the glass size...laughably small.  We were assured that he would make a \"much better one \" next time.  The next ones were jam packed with ice and very little rum, not dark either.  We wrote it off because the steaks and prime rib will more than make up for it.    We ordered lobster bisque, the Iceberg wedge and bacon.  For dinner we ordered the special Milanese (described as a \"nice veal chop pounded thin with Parmesan...) one \"special 27oz bone in prime rib\" and the porterhouse.  Both steaks were requested medium rare, closer to rare.  We also ordered the asparagus with hollandaise and hash browns.    Let's start with the good.  The lobster bisque was full of flavor and rich, but not over so.  The wedge was nice with plenty of tomatoes , bacon, blue cheese and onion strings while being dressed properly.  The asparagus we fine (shouldn't really screw up steamed asparagus) but the hollandaise was forgettable.  Not bad just off.  The porterhouse was very good.  Cooked beautifully with with excellent flavor.  Could have used a bit more seasoning but still great.    Now here comes the tidal was of horrible.  The bacon was saltier than any bacon I have ever had.  Not a single person in our party of four could eat more than a single bite.  The special veal Milanese was burnt and gray all at the same time.  And it was as tough as shoe leather.  And that's not just figure of speech.  It was brutally tough.  Then the prime rib, requested medium rare, closer to rare, came gray with some searing.  It was closer to well done than rare and the texture was a bit mealy.  After we had all tried the prime rib and the veal Milanese we asked to speak with the manager.  While our waiter was fine the manager was a condescending, pardon my poor language, prick.  He had the unmitigated gall to actually ask us what was wrong with the \"Milanese\" (please see the pictures I have provided and I will let you all decide.). He also did the same with the prime rib. Again, the pictures speak for themselves.  When asked if this is what a pounded veal chop should look like Mr Manager responded with \"What's wrong with it?\"  When I asked him if this is what the prime rib they serve all other guests looked like Mr. manager responded \"Yeah, what's wrong with it?\".  And he followed that with \"What do you want me to do?\"  Never once did we get an apology but rather condescending attitude.  I told him we were not happy that we had to pay for the bad dishes.  He left fairly abruptly.    Now I will give him some credit as he did not charge us for the prime rib, the Milanese, or the bacon.  But he never returned to apologize but rather left the waiter to do the work.  A simple apology would have been nice.  Acknowledging that the food was poorly prepared would have gone a long way.  But we were told that we were wrong and that food at the Palm is prepared this way.  Again, pictures speak a thousand words.",

You really can't beat it!  My favorites are the caesar salad and the filet, oscar style. This was actually the first restaurant that I ever tried oscar style on my steak and it's still my favorite. Their cheesecake is actually pretty delicious too. I don't care for raspberry, so I ate it plain and it was amazing.  During my most recent visit, I ordered the lobster and was disappointed in so many ways. However, I am  not letting that ruin my overall opinion of this restaurant.

It's just at the entrance to the forum shops. Why does this matter? If you're local, you can easily park in the (still free) Self Parking garage, take the elevator, make a quick left and BOOM you're there!  Those walking in heels will appreciate this.  Service: meh. We were seated in the back room, (which sounds private but it was not) and I asked the server if she agreed that it was warm. She said, \"it's not cold, it's not hot...it's a nice temperature.\" I was literally sweating...so...neat.   Food: Mine was fab. I had the veal chop ($42). I heard a few other people complaining though - the pasta was \"more than al dente\" and the steak they ordered medium was clearly much more rare than expected.   A final note - DOUBLE CHECK your bill. On our bill, it clearly said \"Gratuity not included,\" but when we read through the actual itemized bill, there was $210 of Gratuity. Now look - I don't mind that at all, it was a 20% auto-grat, that's cool. But...don't misrepresent in the text and say it's not included! We were also charged for an item that never arrived, but like...it's a giant group, these things happen. I'm not docking a star for that.",

The BEST thing on the table was the shoestring onions! Enough about the food let's give a high five for the servers :)) They were attentive and apologized for our meal. The Palm probably acquired a new chef or he just partied the night before because he was not on his game today.

I've eaten here 3 times now and all 3 times were great, great food and great staff. The problem didn't happen until we packed our food up to take home. I got a filet oscar style (which is Hollandaise, crab, and asparagus) but when I got my food I had already eaten 2 shrimp cocktails, some crab cake, lobster bisque, and maybe half the bread basket with butter lol (that's probably where I messed up!) Steak came, ate a couple bites, and asked for the rest to go since I was still getting dessert. They packed my food up, we paid, and were ready to go home.. sounds good right? Wrong, this is where the problem begins. The next day I open up my left overs, excited, and notice there is no crab on my steak or in the to-go container. I show my wife, who thinks that's funny, and she mentions maybe they didn't take it off the plate to put in with it.. that's when I noticed they didn't put the asparagus in as well. Still not a big deal, not too upset, but she thinks I should call to let them know, so I do. I call and ask to speak to a manager. The lady Kelly who answered said she was a manager. I tell her my story about how they didn't pack up my oscar style, which I paid an additional 12 dollars to add on, and that they just threw that away. (It's quite a bit of crab too, I highly recommend it.) Then she paused and said \"and what do you want me too do about it...\" I was shocked! Our check was right around a grand for the night and this is how she responds?? To a place I planned on frequenting more often, hell our friend ate there 3 nights in a row. Just the unprofessionalism and the lack of character and customer service was appalling. I guess Joe's will be getting more business from now on. At least I know my left overs are secure and the managers are trained and well mannered",

Both ordered the same way, charred Medium Rare. They looked beautiful when they arrived. The problem, both order the same way at the same time. One cooked beautifully with a warm red center. Mine was grey towards the edge and bare pink in the deep center, no marbling evident.  I told the waiter and he took it back to be re-fired. On cutting into the second steak I found this it the quite firm and tough to cut through. It was at least red in the center but was still over cooked. The middle was not cool, but cold. The chef's trick, on the re-fired he used a steak from the refer instead of a rested room temp steak to keep it from looking over cooked.   Really chef? You insult both your customers and what should have been an exceptional piece of prime beef with cheap tricks like this. $65 steaks and a $400 check and this is how we are treated...After making the first mistake, which can happen from time to time, you made it worse trying to fix the problem.  I guess they are happy to have tourists who will likely never be repeat customers. I guess they are right, I'll likely never give them my business again.",

I'm a huge carnivore and I am a self proclaimed steak house connoisseur. So it is a little odd for me that neither time did I have steak. Both times were for their Sumner Lobster Fest. Oh yeah.... So amazing from the greeting, to the service and the food as well. Our server was a sweetheart and apparently has been there since they first opened like 20 years ago. Everyone in our group went for the lobster special which started with a salad or lobster bisque. I only ate broccoli and humus all day in preparation for the bisque and its rich creamy delight. My friend opted for the Cesar (which was delicious but not to ever be considered into the same ballgame as the bisque). She was worried she was going to be on lobster overload, however, one bite of my bisque and she had a brand new outlook on life. Next came the lobster which came nice and neatly split not to mention declawed by the staff tableside. We had a plethora of sides including lobster mac n cheese, potatoes at gratin, pancetta green beans and lemon zest broccoli. So much great food! Will be back soon!",

The steak my other friend had, a filet, was tasteless.   She said she had had far better meat at many other steak restaurants. The service was awful.  The waiter had difficulty splitting a check and preparing the lobster to our specifications.   He had difficulty serving the salad with dressing on the side.   And he NEVER brought hot wet towels to cleanse hands after eating the lobsters.   If I didn't stop another server we would never have gotten anything to clean up.   I am member of their 837 club.  They couldn't find my membership.  Just as well.  They have downgraded everything from food to service.  I have been a member since 2006 and this was the worst meal I have ever had there.   I will never return and have told all of my friends about this experience.   Too bad.  I used to love it in NY and was glad to see it here when I moved here.  Never again !!!  Zero stars",

Food was delicious.  I particularly loved the green beans with panchetta and pine nuts toppings. It was so tasty.   My husband loved their hash brown as his fav side dish.   They even made buttered noodles for our six year-old daughter.  We have tried many steak houses in Vegas. Most of them have been great.  We liked this one as well (price was decent).",

Carrot cake single serving can feed 2-3 people. 7 layer double serving could feed 4-5 people and very rich! Server was nice. Head hostess will put unruly patrons in line! Atmosphere inside is dark. Con: server wasn't very tentative. We waited forever for dessert menus and he didnt wait to take all our orders. We had to call him back to the table. They sang for my aunty and uncle's anniversary but they weren't even lively so it was lame! French fries were like regular fries....i'd get better fries at mcdonald's. server couldn't describe his menu items. Compared their coffee to foldgers...really?   For the price of the menu, i was a bit disappointed. Not likely to return.",

Specifically, my dad and I ordered the double 36 oz steak with a 3lb lobster, but the lobster claw meat was small and so Leo gave us an extra claw to compensate. Both my dad and I were blown away. We are from Los Angeles and our favorite steakhouse is the palm in downtown la. However, the Las Vegas location definitely takes the cake. Together they made our night extra special and we definitely can't wait to come back again with my mom and sisters. So thank you for the wonderful meal.",

We waited more than 15 minutes to get a drink - and I don't mean just alcoholic drinks, but that was just the wait for water.  Once we finally received water, the waiter came back 10 minutes later with our cocktails.  Great bloody mary if you can wait for it.   It took another 10 minutes for her to make it back to take our order, and then 10 more to get the bread basket!   Ridiculous.  The food was good - I had a jumbo lump crab cocktail that was full of crab and well worth the price, while others in the group had sandwiches and steak burgers with fries.  My husband said his blue cheese steak burger was delicious, and another guest said that the chicken sandwich from the specialty menu was really tasty.    Overall we would try this restaurant again on another visit to Vegas, but definitely would NOT sit with the inattentive server again.  Cheers!",

Back story: This place wasn't our first choice but I messed up with timing and thinking that kitchens were opened later than they actually were on weekends so yah...since my heart was set on a steakhouse, this was the most accessible place I could come up with given it was past 10 pm and kitchens were closing fast. Literally a super last minute decision that turned out serviceable, just gotta plan ahead a little better next time :)",

    "text": "A coworker recommended this restaurant to me and I recently had a chance to try it. I was in town and made online reservations a day in advance for dinner for a party of five on a Saturday evening @ 6:30pm. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated almost immediately. The table we were seated at was located just inside of the outdoor seating area, which was great, because we could enjoy the pulse of activity going on outside in the forum shops area right in front of us. Our male server was polite and for the most part attentive, but we had to remind him for an item he initially forgot and we had to ask for water refills.   Decent menu selection, but very pricey! The food we ordered was okay...but was nothing special (which included orders of the NY Strip Steak & Filet Mignon). I don't mind paying high prices as long as it's worth it...but in this instance I didn't feel the food quality matched the prices being charged. Which is the same with how we felt about the service. My wife and I felt that we've had a better overall dining experience at Flemings and they aren't even as expensive. Interesting note: I initially tried to get reservations at Flemings, but it was booked solid whereas at this restaurant it was definitely not packed.   Overall, I would have to say nice ambiance, neat location being located in the Caesar's Forum Shops...but in my opinion the food and service fell short of the $$$ paid.",

We sure did get our fill of steak! It was a fabulous steak though. Cooked perfectly and sliced table side. The service was impecable. The atmosphere is fun with all the caricatures everywhere. Very good wine list. This was not our first choice on a busy night when our other plans fell through but ended up being the best meal we had in Vegas. Now the prices are what you would expect from a place with aged steaks but it was worth it. Second best steak I have ever had. We also had a side of the cheese potatoes and they were so flavorful. I could have eaten them for a meal! The sides for 2 are very good portions for the price. You will not leave hungry!",

It also considers with our annual Fall Golf trip to Vegas so here we are.  Meeting in the bar for a few drinks, the very friendly Jax takes care of the boys and our table on the Patio in the forum ships is ready for what we hope is great food and people watching.  JR is serving us tonight and after ordering a very overpriced bottle of wine we are off and running.  Cesar Salads, Traditional Blue Cheese Wedges with beefsteak Tomatoes, and a shrimp cocktail and a shrimp Bruno started off the food orgy.  The wedges were as expected & the Wet & Dry blue Cheese is the same as their Miami location.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their salads which were cold fresh and very tasty.   On to the Entrees.  Excellent for the most part with the NY STRIP & The Rib Eye being the best of the bunch here.  A little disappointing Prime Rib is only available on Friday & Saturday night.  Their price Fix option of $49.00 with Salad, choice of a particular entree and dessert looks great but I have to believe the following.  The Filet Mignon is not the same as the menu item. All 3 were funny looking and gray.  Taste was ok but really a weak presentation.  Small 6 ounce Lobster tail was NOT 6 ounces and it was Ok but not great.   The  1/2 lobsters were much better with plenty of meat and great claws which were expertly cracked and deshelled tableside.    Sides of Half & Half \"Cottage fries and string onions were on the money as well as the sauteed wild mushrooms & Creamed spinach.  Lyonnais potatoes were good but Red Onions instead of traditional white did not do them justice.   A nice giant piece of chocolate cake for the birthday boy was presented along with homemade whipped cream.  Couple of Espressos & Cappuccinos was consumed as well.   Not a perfect night as the Filets & Lobster tails in the price fixe was weak but rest of the food was Top Shelf and service was impeccable as JR did a really great job... 4 Stars tonight!",

My girlfriend and I shared the 4 lb lobster special.  Not only is the lobster the best I have had since having one in Nova Scotia, but we tried the creamed corn brulee and we were both still talking about how great it was, today.  What made our special celebration extra special was our server, Barry.  Could not ask for better service!  Thank you Barry for the creme brulee with 2 candles for our birthdays.  Best restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "Yeah. This place spits game that's legit.  Let me set the scene. Last night, at the Elite event, several Elite Yelpers and I were feeling the hunger a bit. We'd had a few cocktails, and some appetizers. Most of us were ready for a serious nosh session. Thankfully Rob P aka veeRob aka the Master of Disaster had a Happy Hour (Prime Time) menu for Palm saved on his phone.  We walked over, had a seat at the bar, and ordered off this heavenly Happy Hour Menu. 9:30-close.   Let's start with the things I loved:  --Service. Our bartender's name was Jax. I have a slight crush on her. She is pretty awesome. I should come back and talk to her. Hopefully she's not married or something. --Food. Awesome. I ordered the Steak sliders, the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Lobster BLT sliders. My total tab was under 20 bones. --The ambience. Perfect. I was able to hang out with my friends, and watch some basketball. All at once.  I'd come back. This is a great spot for a date, business lunch, or whatnot. It's a tad pricey when it's not Happy Hour. I'll be a bargain shopper and come back during Prime Time.  Next time, I'm coming back and trying the oysters. Only a $1.50 or so. Not bad.   And yes, this is a multi-location restaurant (a chain). There are some locations in LA. This is just as good as the original in NYC. Git some.",

I had their club member special, which includes a salad, half and half of cottage fries and onion rings, and an order of their Filet Mignon Oscar style.  The salad was pretty standard, mixed greens tosses with light vinegrette.  It definitely went great with their assorted bread basket, which has a white chocolate bread that I've never had anywhere else!  I'd go back just for that bread!  For those of you who don't know what cottage fries are, they're basically hot-off-da-fryer-fresh thick cut potato chips.  The serving is huge!  The plate was piled high with them fries, then topped off with another pile of  strings of thinly battered and fried sweet onion that has a perfect balance of crunchiness and sweetness.  I'd go back just for them fries and rings too!  Oscar style Filet Mignon, where do I start!  The tender filet is always perfectly cooked to order, then its paired with that creamy hollandaise sauce, fresh lumped crab, and baby asparagus...simply perfection!  service is friendly and it's also a great place to people watch if you sit outside the restaurant.",

For a class operation that takes pride in their steaks what was served bordered on one star.   My son  had a Delmonico and I had the Strip.  Both came out properly cooked. Problem was is that their was no taste. Massive doses of salt did not help. And we don't normally use salt. Service was good but no concession even though we advised her before they were half eaten. Poor quality has no place in this operation.",

    "text": "Without exception, the Businessman's Lunch has to be one of the best deals in town!  The Caesar Salad is truly one of the tastiest I've ever had and the portion was huge!  We each had fish (one Salmon and one Swordfish).  Didn't care for the cottage fries, and suggest the option of a French Fry or some other potato.  Also had the vegetable du jour and the swordfish was served on a bed of broccoli.  OK, found my new favorite desert--the Palm's Key Lime Pie!  It looks entirely different that most Key Lime pies in that there is no meringue and the color of this one looks like butterscotch.  But it is so dense, rich in citrus flavor and simply unbelievable--very homemade tasting.  I really cannot endorse the Palm enough for this bargain ($24 for all three courses per person) and hope to have dinner there next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "So, I might be a bit biased because my good friend, Tommy, is a bartender at this location.  However, I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment.  First, the atmosphere is great.  I usually dine at the bar becuase that is where Tommy works, but even without that, this is the best place to be, in my opinion.  One night, I sat next to Pete Rose, who is a regular at the bar.  Tommy tells me all kinds of fun stories about the people he meets and the regulars that visit him at the bar.  As far as food, I highly recommend the tomato capri salad and the filet mignon.  I always get my steak prepared medium rare.  It usually comes out a bit on the rare side (which I like) so if you want medium rare by \"normal\" standards, you might want to order medium.  The calamari is also very good.  The only thing that I have ever tasted here that I wasn't a big fan of was the lobster bisque.  However, I have taken guests who really enjoyed it.  It might be a matter of personal taste.  If you go on the right night, there is an Elvis impersonator working as the bathroom attendant.  Gotta love Vegas!",

I looked over the menu and ordered the business lunch special (3 course lunch for like $20). The soup of the day was a chowder that was fairly decent but the fresh fish of the day however was drained in sauce that was overpowered by lemon juice. I could only handle a few bites and moved on to my vegetable side which was way over cooked and soggy. I prayed the dessert would be better and it definitely was thank goodness.  The service was nice but was incredibly slow. We had a flight to catch and I had to ask for my ticket three times, boo.",

    "text": "We ate at the Palm for a work dinner with six others, and aside from leaving full, happy, and slightly buzzed from the wine, I left feeling conflicted.  The menu is standard for a steakhouse---they do meat, and they do seafood, and not much else.  The sides come extra, and are more than big enough for two people to share.  They don't mark up their wine as much as most places do---which is a good thing.  For Las Vegas, though, their wine selection leaves a bit to be desired.  What causes me such consternation about the Palm is the disparity between the food/prices and the attitude/service.   They have great food, fantastic food actually, and you pay relatively fair prices for it.  In fact, the steak I had there is one of the best I've ever had.  Unfortunately, it was matched with equally terrible service.  They are slow, they are rude, they are arrogant, they are pushy, and no matter how many times we asked for water, asked for more wine, asked for butter for the bread, or asked the server not to do something he didn't listen!  I wish we'd listened when, while waiting to be seated, a woman walked out of the back dining room and announced to the entire restaurant that they should leave while they still could to avoid a terrible experience.  For an 8-top, purchasing multiple bottles of wine, and nearly everything on the menu (total bill over $2,000) you'd think you could get better service.  Thankfully, I wasn't paying.  If I was, I'd never go back here again.",

Our entire table got the special which increased the value of the meal though it would have been acceptable at full price. However, at a place like Palm, Filet (Oscar style), Au Gratin Potatoes, and asparagus, along with the famous lobster bisque for $39.50 really can't be beat. The filet was perfectly done, and there was no cheese or butter spared in the making of the Au Gratin potatoes. Even at full price, I would highly recommend the entire aforementioned meal.  The service that we received was absolutely top notch; professional and extremely helpful, while remaining casual and friendly. As an entire experience, the Palm is a can't miss spot. Given the great food, friendly service, and central location in Caesar's, the Palm is a great choice for any steak loving group at anytime of the year.",
