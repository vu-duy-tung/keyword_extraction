The walls have this strange  neon green paint which works for the place, in a weird way.    I usually get the 2-item combo with duck and pork belly. The duck is always juicy and tasty, minding a few bones here and there. The skin is flavorful and the duck fat just melts in your mouth. The pork belly has a sweet and somewhat nutty taste and the crispy skin adds a great texture in every bite. You can watch the guy take the hanging meat and chop it up. The combo also includes a large helping of rice and a small side of Chinese broccoli.  They have a large selection of dishes and combinations so there has to be something there for everyone to enjoy.",

I thought the restaurant was efficient and fast.   1. Chinese sausage fried rice very good ( on the menu it says salted fish and sausage, just get sausage)  2. Seafood dry chow fun ( okay but not that good) maybe the gravy ones better  3. The BBQ pork and roast pork belly was the best. The roast duck was okay kind of chewy want the skin more crisp  Overall food was very good for the price $38  For all the food I just mentioned",

Notice I said tried...  we ordered a pound ($8) only to be told it's only available as a take out item and that they would kick us out if we ate it there.  But we could order 3 side dishes at $3 and that would equal a pound.  We'll take 2.  The owner stood and watch the server scoop to make sure she wasn't going to give us extra.  Awkward!!   We ordered the roast pork appetizer only to be told they just sold out of it.  Ok, give us one of the 3 ducks hanging in the window.  Sorry someone came in right now and bought the last three.  Well, let's go won ton noodle soup.  The broth was super salty but flavorful and the won tons were tasty.  30 minutes later they told us they had more duck and roast pork.  Great we'll take a side dish of both.  Sorry you can only buy in lbs.  Ok we will take a pound.  Duck was super fatty and the skin was not crispy at all, yuck.  I must admit the pork was good.  I expect service at Chinese restaurants to be horrible and they met and exceeded my every expectations.",

Taking our lead from other Yelp reviewers we shared a double BBQ: Duck and Roasted Belly Pork and also ordered the Beef Chow Fun (dry). This gave us a chance to try both sides of the name: BBQ & Noodles!  We were pork belly virgins  and let me tell you after RBP, we'll never look back! It was beyond yummy; crispy outside and SO smooth and tender inside. The duck had great flavor as well, but a bit more fatty than meaty. It had great flavor and what do you expect from duck! We still loved it. Dish came with rice, a bit of 'gravy' and greens. Oh and don't forget the dipping sauces, beyond yummers.    The Beef Chow Fun was another amazing dish that we tried after reading another Yelp reviewer. So glad we did!  Wide perfectly cooked noodles, a very light sauce, scallions, and beef. The beef was cooked to perfection and didn't have a trace of fat or gristle.  Beyond good.     We'll be in town for a couple of weeks, so lucky for us we'll get to go back!",

The bbq pork was one of the leaner ones I've had, which sigifies good quality.  The roast pork was pretty flavorful too.  The duck was just okay (not that much meat and a lot of gristle), don't really recommend this unless you have to have duck.   The noodles are okay, but portions are big. We got beef chow fun, and some dish using thin wheat noodles ($7 each for both) - both weren't that great but certainly passable.  We also had salty fish fried rice which was a little too fishy - I wouldn't do that again.  A lot of folks ordered the Cantonese style fried noodles ($10) - that probably would've tasted better and had heaping portions.",

The roast pork, the roast duck, bbq pork, dumplings, it is all top notch and absolutely worth the trip over if you are spending a weekend on the Vegas strip.  The wait can get somewhat lengthy. The seating is a bit cramped like they might have put one too many tables in there. The service is quick and efficient even if it's a little robotic. The prices were good, you can leave there having spent under $10 a person and feel like you've more than gotten your money's worth.  Parking is plentiful and the location is easy to find.   Overall, I'd say if you have a desire for chinese bbq, you can't do any better in Vegas.",

Anyway, the noodle soup is the noodle you selected with the sides as toppings.  It tasted okay to me, but the beef balls served with the largest I have ever seen served in restaurants.  Including tax it costs $6.50.  I personally think the BBQ item over Rice is the better menu option, so I will definitely come back and try more entrees off of that portion of the menu.  And Roast Duck Wonton Noodle Soup sounds good as well.  And this is a CASH only business.",

For under $4, there were quite a few wontons in the bowl.  But wontons were just okay, the wontons at Noodle Palace actually tasted better.    The HK style combo noodle soup on the other hand was very flavourful.  The broth was quite tasty.  The last time I had this type of combo noodle soup was over 20 years ago back in HK.  I ordered three additional toppings for the noodle soup - pork skin, beef ball and beef stew.  I expected a decent bowl of noodle soup, but what I got instead was a big bowl with not too much toppings inside.  I was a little disappointed with the portion size.   But because the broth is so good, I will definitely come back for more.    Next time I will also try their BBQ meats.",

If you're in Vegas the whole weekend and already tried pho, then you should definitely try this place.  I found this place through YELP and I would totally recommend it to people.  It's some ways from the strip, but worth the drive.    The food I've tried: *WonTon Noodle Soup with Roast Duck: great price and great portion.  The soup was clear and flavorful.  Oh, the roast duck is so good and I remember a big piece of shrimp in my wonton.   *Chinese Fried Donut: This is very good here, nice and crisp with flavor, it's good if you put it in your noodle soup or porridge.  *BBQ Pork: I like to order this as appetizer, everyone loves it at the table.   YUM! Makes me hungry thinking about it.",

    "text": "The first time I had the roast pork from this restaurant was at my hubby's cousin's Christmas party.  It was delicious.  What's there not to like about roast pork?  Uh, well...those of you that are watching your calories and cholesterol,  don't read this post.  Shoo- go away!! Or go and take a Zocor or Lipitor and come back to this post.  As I was saying, the crispy skin and the lightly juicy fatty meat was balanced very well.  The flavor was very nice and I knew I wasn't eating Sam Woo's roast pork.  It different, it didn't have the Sam Woo flavor.  It had it's own distinct flavor that was equally as good.  And I was so happy it wasn't Sam Woo.  In the Asian population, everyone knows that Sam Woo has the best BBQ in town.    Two weeks after Christmas, I went back to order 2 lbs of roast pork for dinner.  The roast pork was consistent and still tasted just as good.  A week later the hubby and I went there for dinner and their duck noodle soup did not disappoint.  Oh yeah, I'm total fan of this place.  It's cheap and food is good and hearty.   Like most Chinese dives, they take cash only and you can communicate with them in English but if you speak a little Chinese here it goes a long way.... Oh yeah, this one here had to bust out in her Cantonese.  For this super Americanized Asian girl that was real hard!  Real hard but so worth it for the good food. -M2",

Noodle soups - f-ing great Chow Fun - huge portions and also really good. I got it \"wet\" and it came with a lot of veges and meat Wontons - plump and tasty BBQ duck - not too fatty and good.   They also have the fried bread but we didnt try it. It looked good though. Service sucked but then again, going to a cheap chinese restaurant and expecting good service is like interviewing Kanye West and expecting him to be modest...it rarely happens but when it does, it's pleasantly surprising.   Definitely recommend coming here for a nice cheap meal off the strip.",

What's great is that they have this little bar type thing at the front that you can look at and see what other things you want added to your noodles, like tofu, fish kabobs, or various internal parts of the cow. Great place to go for lunch and the prices are fair!",

The roast pork belly has a crispy skin w/ just the right amount of fat. The BBQ pork has the right balance of savory and sweetness. Their porridge is the traditional Cantonese style cooked for hours where you will not find the rice grain but packed with flavor. Their perfectly cooked veggie w/ lightly drizzled oyster sauce is just impeccable (in other restaurant typically over or under cooked and drown in oyster sauce). Their wonton and dumpling filling are just packed w/ flavor and have perfect chewy texture (owner said they are made fresh daily).   I honestly don't see how anyone who frequent Chinese restaurant can give this place anything less than 4 stars.",

The service is not as fast, but in Vegas there is no need for NYC-rush ( : This place has quickly become one of my favorite go-to places for a cheap, simple, delicious meal in all of Las Vegas.   My favorite is the roast duck and wonton noodle soup. Great portion for the price and generous with noodles (very important). You have your choice between several different types of noodles. I've tried the egg and the ramen, both tasty. If you don't want to spend $, you can get a wonton noodle soup for just $3.99 and the portion is perfect. You'd be surprised how much food they give you for such a price! My friends ordered the pork belly with rice and it was incredible.   I highly recommend this place above other Chinese restaurants in the city. I will most definitely be a frequent customer : )",

Both pork dishes have the right amount of fat (not too much but just a little to keep it juicy).  The pork dish with the crispy skin was very good and better than most places.  The dipping sauce was very tasty.    Much better than the Sam Woo in Las Vegas.  Prices were good.  Service was good - I did order in Chinese so may be that helped a little?    Seating was a little messy and they don't really have a system.  People showing up during lunch time and for a second, no one really know who was there first.  The waitress did try to sort it out.  We had to wait about 15 min on a Thur afternoon (shortly after 12 pm or so).   Given the food and knowing how Chinese restaurants are, I am still a fan.  By the way - cash only.",

I usually add duck or pork belly to it.  The pan fried noodle with vegetable and BBQ pork is my second favorite.  You must try it if you are a mushroom lover because they put big chunks of mushrooms (2-3 kinds, not the boring button mushroom) in the dish.  I give the place two thumbs up not only for the soup and noodle but also for the hot sauce provided on every table.  The unique flavor of both the hot sauce and vinegar go with their food perfectly so that the combined flavor stand out comparing to the same dishes in other Chinese restaurants.   Another big plus is that for a little Chinese fast food place the service is always good.  The waiters and waitresses are fast, attentive and friendly.",

I have to  say why does the original Location uses less MSG if any of you people knows what that is? and the new Location uses more..when I see some of the post you people write and mention that there pork belly was a little salty well if they don't use more MSG how would they taste so good. all u people is eating MSG..there price is not all that expensive if they are serving legit Chinese BBQ but there not..if u can see American people eating in there than id a different story. U don't want to see all out Chinese people in a restaurant because most of the time Chinese will go for big potion and cheap price. For u to get that they really have to use shity ingredient and u don't want to eat these kind of food. I really thought that people in SF CA has a lower expectation on Chinese food but even in Vegas too. This is just a disgrace for Chinese food.",

Their food reminds me of San Francisco. They are fast and the food comes out quick.   Their congee is delicious and it always hits the spot. Our favorite is the chicken with no bones congee. If you order the congee order the fried Chinese donut (fried bread) to dip in it. You won't regret it!  But they do run out pretty quick.   The BBQ combo is filling and you have a list to choose from for your meat. Their roast duck and roast pork is our favorite. The prices are pretty cheap. They do get busy and there is a line. The service is ok, you have to flag people down when it's busy. They sometimes ignore you. Its a typical Chinese restaurant like back home. Just make sure you raise your arm high enough for them to see. Like I said before you come for the food and not for the service. Don't forget they are CASH ONLY!",

The inside is kind of stuffy and like a typical Chinese take-out restaurant but that means all the more authentic! I had the opportunity to come here and finally try their renowned duck and char siu!   The duck wasn't bad in my opinion, definitely average or a little above average which is a good thing. The Char Siu thought was where it was at. Lightly crispy on the edges and a nice sweet glaze on top has me coming back for more! I definitely will pay a visit when I come back to Vegas!   Also, this place is cash only and most dishes on the menu are $8-$12 so be prepared!",

As usual the service is great and yes she got a great tip.   I also ordered the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  Without divulging their secret I asked what type of salted fish they used for this dish.  I know got guts to ask ( l like to cook myself).  She answered that they salt their own fish.  Now that's the sign of an excellent restaurant. Just like the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco Chinatown back in '50 and '60s I just keep coming back because the flavor is superb and this is as real as it gets.  No need to go back to SF Chinatown for me.",

If anything, you have to try this.  I usually buy it by the pound and bring it home to share because it's that good. I also brought a group of friends here and they said it was better than anything they've had in California, which is saying a lot!  When does Vegas ever one-up Cali?!    My last visit here, I got the Roasted Duck Wonton Noodle Soup which came with Chinese broccoli, a heaping nest of noodles, wontons, and a generous portion of roasted duck.  For $8, it's a steal!  They really now how to make something as simple as wonton soup, stand out.    The servers also speak Chinese and Vietnamese, which is definitely a plus if you speak either!  I speak neither, but their English is fine too.  My friends and I were ordering in all 3 languages to our server, which I thought was pretty cool too.    I came in at 10:05 am (it opens at 10am) with a group of friends and it was already full!  Luckily there were still a couple tables open.  5 minutes into service and they're already a full house?!  That's when you know it's good.",

    "text": "Whenever my family and I go to Las Vegas, we always always HAVE to go to Asian BBQ & Noodles, and it's not because of my parents' inability to be deprived of Chinese food for too long, it's because it's legitimately the best roast duck and roast pork I've had in the US (and I live in a very Asian community in SoCal)!   Although it hasn't happened to us before, we've been warned that some times they may run out on roast duck and roast pork (GASP I KNOW THE HORROR!) so I'd advise to call ahead if you're worried about missing out of bbq heaven.   Each bite of roast pork is actually the perfect combination of crispy skin + juicy meat + guilty pleasure of fat. The roast duck is also such a winner of marinated deliciousness. We always order a side of plain, wonton noodles, dried style to complement the sauciness of the roast duck. It comes slightly oily from the sesame oil, but soooo tasty and it soaks up the sauce from the roast duck REALLY WELL.   Food: Hands down, 5 stars Service: Quick but not always the friendliest because they can get super busy, 3 stars  But really, the deliciousness of the meal overrules any sub-par service!",

We've been coming here since they first opened and haven't been anywhere else for these yummy dishes since.   Crispy Roasted Pork - Has the light crispy skin roasted to perfection. The seasoning on it is spot on as well  Roasted Duck - When they first opened their ducks were always plumped and meaty like they were on steroids. Now it's been a hit or miss but is still perfectly roasted and seasoned  BBQ Pork - very moist and seasoned well. Love the fatty parts lmao  Wonton noodle soup - wontons are perfectly made and not under seasoned. Noodles aren't over cooked or under done. Comes with Chinese broccoli and the broth is seasoned good unlike other places  Place is great. This place is pretty small so is always packed!! For to go orders call in advance. For crispy pork make sure you call if your coming late at night in case they're sold out. It happens pretty often. Don't forget to bring cash since it is CASH ONLY! Enjoy!",

    "text": "This is hands down the best place for Chinese Bbq meats in all of Greater Las Vegas.  The one drawback is that the prices are,  imo, way too high,  inflated only because of greediness by the owners.  (i.e. they can charge it and we will still go since they really don't have any competition in this town).  They are opening a new branch on Spring Mountain soon,  as I hear,  but am unsure when.   The place is always jam packed,  and yet the service is quite good.   So yeah, if you have no problems with paying $13 for a combo plate of 3 Chinese bbq meats (as compared with Boston's price of equal substance and quality at $7.50 ) then you must go here when you crave it in Las Vegas.  The roast duck is excellent here as well,  but again the price of $12 for half a duck and $24 for a whole duck is expensive even compared with Boston pricing.   But for new transplants like myself from the Boston area,  I have no choice!  The restaurant itself is tucked into a corner of the mall,  across the street (Jones Blvd) from the famous Chinese supermarket 168, and is almost a typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant,  but with super caring attentive staff running around in this madhouse of a restaurant.   Again for first timers,  beware that it is cash only and is closed for business on Fridays.  Come and enjoy!!!!",

The skin was perfectly crispy, but not too hard and crunchy like some other restaurants.   The meat was perfectly seasoned and very tender.  Some places might have decent skin, but the meat may come out tough, dry, or bland.  This place literally perfected their roast pork!!  The roast duck was also notable.  It was very flavorful and had slightly crispy skin on.  The char siu, although decent, was our least favorite.  All our noodle dishes were very good.  I loved their pork intestine, beef innards, and wontons.  The noodles itself had really good texture to it -- slightly \"bouncy\" like how HK style noodles should be.  The broth was good also, although I've had better elsewhere since it lacked some depth.  Even as busy as they were, they were able to provide excellent service to us.  This is a difficult quality to find in a Chinese restaurant, especially where I'm from.  We enjoyed this place so much that I had to come back on my last day of vacation to pick up some takeout for our flight back!!",

They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees.   My go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.  Most of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.",

I am very upset because I drove there and found out they close on the 18th and so disappointed because I wanted to bring a roast duck home, not sure if they close on every saturday. I was there on Thursday and was told they close on friday.   So I was there on Thursday for lunch/dinner around 4pm. I got half roast duck to go and super thrill that the duck skin stay crispy after I get back to my room. a good bbq rib would has the meat fall off the bone, as well as this roast duck. I didn't take much effort to bite the meat off the bone. No msg proven by my tongue. In the duck sauce I can see the cumin and star arise!!! legit cantonese style roast duck!! i ate the half duck all by myself and my stomach was not upset. Too bad I cannot drive 257 miles just for the duck and really hated that they close on saturday without notice",

I've been to Hong Kong and had the best won ton noodles ever.. Nothing will ever compare, but I will say Asian BBQ & Noodles produces a very delicious product in fact it rivals the best i've tasted in Hawaii.  So, after 2 filling days of pigging out, my friend and I decided to cut back on the binge eating a bit.  Since it was a bit nippy out, we ventured for won ton noodles and roast pork.  We sat down and instantly I knew it was gonna be a winner.  Everyone around us was speaking cantonese. NOT A WORD OF ENGLISH. NOT ONE!  We looked at the menu, thank goodness it was in english and ordered 2 won ton thin noodles and an order of roast pork.  Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup ($.4.99): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg?select=pEMMe3ZosrS2rfVA9RWbPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aD0E...</a>  Order of Roast Pork ($5.99?): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg?select=VeVh0G6wcGxcwHviU6gTAg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aD0E...</a>  Very very very good noodles and amazing won ton. I haven't had similar quality won tons since my trip to Hong Kong last year.  Roast pork is crazy crispy.  Not just crispy, CRAZY CRISPY.  You won't chip a tooth, but you will definitely feel the crunch. BEST ROAST PORK I have had in a long time.  The restaurant was VERY clean, the wait staff struggles with english at times but definitely know enough to take your order, and the best part of all our lunch was $20 TIP INCLUDED..  My friend said the other dishes are awesome as well.  If you have a hankering for Cantonese chinese food and are on a budget, this is definitely the spot for you.. You know what they say, \"when in vegas, do as the CHINESE do.\" :)",

I've been here a few times now and have compared the wonton noodle soup (my comfort food) to other's I've had in Vegas and they are hands down the best in the city.

As I entered, I noticed the food hanging in the display as well as other prepared items.  The smell was very welcoming.  I wanted to try everything.  It was one of those moments where my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach...    We weren't too hungry and were actually planning on dining late late night afterwards so we decided to share a huge plate of combination fried rice and Roasted Duck as well as Pork.  They were both thinly sliced and sauced but prepared to perfection. Both were packed with flavor and very satisfying.  A side of two sauces were provided as well.    The color selection for the walls were odd and unique but didn't bother me.  The dining area is laid out to fit the maximum amount of guests.  The service is great and quick.  I'd be back again in a heartbeat, if I have a craving for quality Asian BBQ.   You have to try this place at least once if you're in Las Vegas.    You can thank me later.",

We came on a Sunday morning and thankfully didn't have to wait but if you're going during lunch time, make sure you get there a bit earlier because the parking lot and the line could get very busy.  BBQ 3 COMBO PLATTER ($17.99) - their roasted belly pork was SO crispy and now I know why they're known for that. It actually surprised me how crispy it was and the person sitting next to me could hear the crunch. This is a must-get when you're here, whether you're getting a combo platter or the roasted pork by itself. The BBQ pork was thinly cut, different from the kind that I usually see which is a bit thicker. Their roasted duck was good as well. They give a sweeter sauce for the roasted duck and another that I think was just hoisin sauce.  PAN FRIED NOODLES WITH BEEF ($11.99) - I was craving pan fried noodles so I was really excited about this. I thought it was okay; the noodles were crispy and had a decent amount of beef in it. It wasn't anything too special but still solid.  SHRIMP DUMPLING NOODLE SOUP ($7.99) - the shrimp dumplings were very tasty! I put a little bit of hot sauce in there and it just brought out the flavors even more.   This place is not too far off the strip if you have a car so it's a nice place to go to when you're leaving Vegas. I definitely want to come back here when I go to Vegas again.",

There were a few parties ahead of us, but we got seated within 2 minutes of writing my name down. Service is fast, which is crucial if you're friggin' hungry. Per Yelp's advice, we brought cash for our meal.  We ordered #23 2-combo BBQ plate with roasted pork belly and roasted duck for $13.99--delicious. I also got #38 roasted duck wonton noodle soup, $9.99. The shrimp & pork-filled wontons were fab (I love wontons), and the thin egg noodles went well with the salty meats. My boyfriend got #40 chicken vermicelli rice noodle soup, $9.99. The shredded chicken meat seemed a bit dry, and my boyfriend admits that he should have gotten what I ordered.  BBQ on fleek.",

    "text": "We've been back a few times since my original 5-star review.  Since then, prices are up and quality is down.  Today, we ordered a combination chow fun.  I asked the waitress to order it with less bean sprouts.  Instead, we got beef chow fun with a lot of bean sprouts.  When another waiter brought it to our table, I pointed out that we ordered the combo with beef, chicken and shrimp and that perhaps this was for another table.  He said that it was ours and that it was noted on the order.  We ate it since it was already prepared and I wasn't sure what they'd do to our new order in the kitchen if they had to redo it.  The BBQ plate of roast duck and roast pork was ok, but not as good as we've remembered.  The duck wasn't as flavorful and the skin on the pork wasn't crispy.  Too bad since we always stop here to eat when we're in Vegas.  Guess we'll have to discover another new place.",

The lady answered my inquiry on the phone was very promising but after I picked up , they were obviously fried from the frozen package of 4 that you can buy from the store for $3.49 . They had charged me over $9 for ONLY 3 pieces !!  This is not the way to do the business , honestly is a key to success . This happened at their newly opened restaurant location on Spring Mountain Road . I looked around their dining area , there was NOT even one table had customers . All wait staffs were looking at me as I was talking to the cashier about the issue. But too bad , they had collected my money so i wouldn't get a refund ! My loss but will never go back there again . I have coworkers had the same bad experiences !",

    "text": "I love this place! They've really nailed all of their flavors and I've yet to order anything here that I didn't like. If you're coming here for the first time with a group, I'd recommend getting the BBQ 3 Combo Platter with Roast Pork, BBQ Pork, and Duck. It's a great way to sample three of their amazing meats. If you're not a fan of pork, the Soy Sauce Chicken is very good too. My favorite fried rice here is the Chicken and Salty Fish and you can't go wrong with their Wonton Noodle Soup.  Something to keep in mind is that they are CASH ONLY, so plan for that. Also sometimes if you eat in, the service can be kinda meh. I don't speak any Chinese but sometimes I have a pleasant experience and other times it's hard to get anyone's attention, but honestly this place is a great hole in the wall and I come here for amazing food, so the service doesn't really phase me. Another thing to note is that they're a fantastic option for takeout. I always see them get tons of takeout orders when I eat there and I also call in to pickup orders here when I just feel like having some BBQ and rice at home.   The best takeout options in my opinion are the BBQ on Rice options on the menu (items #1-8) and also the Wonton Noodle Soup. They are such a great value, with the BBQ on Rice items being $7.50 - $8.00 each and the soup being even cheaper than those.   Last note: The restaurant itself is located in the corner of a very popular plaza with a handful of other restaurants such as Ramen Tatsu, District One, and Chubby Cattle, so parking here during prime hours can be difficult.",

Wow really expensive for a little hole in the wall noodle joint.  I ordered the roast duck, BBQ pork, and ginger chicken. The barbecue pork and duck were top-notch. The ginger chicken however is served cold which was kind of a turn-off for me because I guess they just coach the chicken leg and boiling water with ginger in it and then put it on the plate so it almost feels like you're eating a raw chicken leg when you look at the boiled skin of the dish. Stick with the duck and pork and you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "This is your one stop shop for all things Chinese BBQ. The centerpiece of the restaurant is that brightly lit display case full of beautiful roasted meats, all waitin' for your pickin'. What will it be? The succulent roast duck seasoned to the bone, that sweet sticky char siu, or my personal favorite, heavenly juicy roasted pork with crunchy skin? A combination plate with a side of refreshing palate cleansing pickled radish is the answer for those who want to try it all  But you already know that. This restaurant is named Asian BBQ and Noodle after all. What you may not know is that you're forgetting the latter \"noodle\" half of it and you're missing out. The noodle and rice dishes here are equally as spectacular as their meats. Yes, flip that menu over and enter into a whole new realm of carb heaven! Carby delights ordered this visit include the salted fish and chicken fried rice, Chao Chow style rice noodles, beef chow fun, and tomato beef on rice  -The fried rice (10/10) was absolute perfection from taste to texture- miles away from your average down the street Chinese spot. Don't like the salted fish scare ya! It's not fishy but fragrant and aromatic. Always good and def one of the \"must have's\" here. -The rice noodle rolls (6/10) were so soft and silky and a perfect companion to an egg batter and hot wok. The \"Chao Chow\" style just means with shrimp and bbq pork sticks. I found this dish a bit dry and bland, so add some chili and soy for more flavor! -Beef chow fun (7/10) was ordered dry. There's a known saying that you should order this if you want to gauge a chef's cooking skills, since it's so easy to mess up. The chow fun here is much less oily than other places but that also means a bit of the \"wok hei\" is sacrificed. -Tomato beef on rice (8/10) is one of my childhood favorites. Clearly, it still is. Sweet and sour tomato sauce with silky scrambled eggs and tender beef on top of hot rice. What's not to love?  Delicious, filling, and cheap are all words to describe the food here. Although it's terribly busy here at peak hours, and the seating is tight and cramped, and although that tasteless lime green wallpaper may bore a hole in your eyes (maybe that's just me), this cash only joint is without a doubt worth seeking out an ATM for. Only thing bad thing about this place is they're closed Friday's  They've also got a new location that opened just not too long ago and not too far away from this one. I'll have to check it out sometime",

While I was waiting for my half a duck to be cut, the lady cutting it saw the waitress walking pass her with an empty entry and put literally OUR CUT PIECES OF DUCK into the damn tray. Usually I wouldn't mind if I didn't order half a duck, but to witness her giving away the duck I'm going to pay for is ridiculous. While handing us the food, we stood by our grounds and spoke up for ourselves. The lady tells us \"I don't understand what you're saying\" in Cantonese. Excuse me? We are from China so it's funny how you suddenly don't understand and then before we left she said \"well that's the boss so she can do what she wants\".   From my experience, I just want you guys to know to beware of their shadiness towards their customers. They aren't going by their words and are clearly cheating their way with it. I hope you guys witness this and NEVER COME BACK HERE.",

We came here especially for the roasted pork belly, which by all accounts was worth the trip. Nice staff, and they helpfully directed us to the nearest ATM. Like a lot of places in LV you need cash and will have to run to a janky ATM machine (and pay $3+ fee for the pleasure).   Ordered the roast pork belly with rice and the combo bbq, roast pork belly & duck. Served with a big mound of rice, Chinese greens and some pickled carrot and daikon strips. The pork belly tasted nice, and there was a pleasant dipping sauce, but the skin was so hard it was difficult to chew.  Really enjoy a bit of crackling, so this was a real bummer. The duck was chopped into perfect chunks to pick up with chopsticks ant pop into your mouth, but surprise, still attached to some pesky bones. That was a bit frightening! Tasty though.   Slightly disappointing, but maybe my expectations were a bit high. You're spoiled for choice in Chinatown, and if you're looking for a place that is a hidden gem and knocks your socks off, keep looking.",

Our short stopover at Las Vegas (before moving on to our Zion vacation) means we need to seize every moment and be very selective on where we have each of our meals.  This is our first meal after arrival because I just can't say 'no' to delicious BBQ and noodle soup.  Hubby and I ordered a combo dish (crispy pork and soy chicken), wonton soup (hold the noodle, need tummy space for other stuff), spicy cold pig ear appey, and then a whole duck (mainly to-go to enjoy later in the hotel).  The food was delicious.  Crispy pork certainly has that nice crispy skin.  The roast duck and soy chicken were both very flavorful.  The pig ears are certainly spicy and has that crunch texture I am looking for.  Wonton warms my heart and soul (my comfort food).  It was a very happy first meal.  The service, like everything in the restaurant, is direct, efficient, and no frill.  This is exactly what I had expected for a good satisfying meal.  No fluff, just good delicious food.",

We also got chicken porridge due to my wife has a toothache, surprisingly the porridge is really good, you need to put soy sauce and a little bit of chili sauce for the kick. The last thing we got was wonton noodle soup, I personally enjoy that the most out of all the dishes, the soup is tasty.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place out for such a long time. I actually stopped by a couple of months ago in the middle of lunch hour, and it was so crowded (even for to-go ordering) that we just couldn't stand to wait. I'm so glad that I finally made the time to come back.  You'll find a lot of awesome entrees in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese (some of the employees speak it, actually) on the menu. Noodle soups, congee, chow mein, and fried rice options abound. Large trays of meats are available for advance order. There's even various pig parts to order if you're into that kind of thing.  However, for my first attempt, I had to go for the \"BBQ 2 Combination With Rice\" for $6.99. I had the roasted pork belly (aka crispy pork) and the roasted duck as my options, and I have no regrets. These two meats actually bring back childhood memories from when my parents used to order trays of them from a local butcher and we'd enjoy them at home with some rice that we'd cooked.  Every table in the restaurant was taken - go figure - so I got my order in a to-go box. Instant nostalgia with the pork and duck laid on a bed of rice, plus a healthy side of Chinese cabbage. I just had the time of my life sitting in my car eating these delights. The pork was chopped into very manageable rectangular portions, each with perfectly crunchy skin, a layer of white, and a layer of dark meat. The duck pieces had lovely golden brown skin and a very anise-y seasoning on the bottom. Make sure to expect bones if you order the roasted duck, and you'll just have to kinda slice or bite them off to get to the meat.  I'm already plotting my next trip back. Maybe I can sit down and enjoy a nice noodle soup next time. That would be a great winter lunch, mmm...",

The beef chow mein had too much sprouts but still tasted ok. Overall, 4 stars is appropriate.",

Well mostly good   First off, I came here because of a coworkers recommendation so I decided to finally check it out.    When I got here it was packed but I went for take out. I noticed the duck and pork hanging and I was in awe and drooling over it. I love roast duck and roast pork. You know your in a good Asian restaurant went you smell like the food. I ordered the bbq 2 combination plate of roast duck and roast pork. My uncle got the same plate but with bbq instead of the roast pork. Now as for flavors, the pork has a good balance of Chinese 5 spice and cooked long enough to be tender to the teeth. The duck was awesome also. Love that skin and flavors on it. Just what I'm looking for when I roast duck.   Now my only gripe to this place and why I gave it 3 stars was that while I was waiting to get my food, I seen a couple of flies roaming around and at least one flying in the steam table. As a person who works in the restaurant industry especially in the back of the house, that is a red flag. That is no Bueno. Not good in my eyes. Other than that, I'd give this place 5 stars because of the food, the flavors of the food and the price I'm getting for it. No doubt I'll still go back. Just don't want to see any flies again.",

    "text": "My brother in law recommended this place so my husband and I decided to give it a try. And we are so glad we did! It was a different twist from the original flavors you find around LA. Their wonton's were especially flavorful! They added a bit of sesame seeds in them to give it that flavor. Would not have imagined wonton's ever with sesame seeds nor did we ever think works well in a wonton, but it did. Their noodles are a bit different from the traditional (darker yellow and curlier) type noodles. They are lighter and more vermicelli-like but surprisingly still el dante in texture which makes up for it. I prefer the traditional way on this one, so depending on your taste buds you may or may not prefer the noodles. The soup is also different (not your traditional or as genuine). Basically, a different twist in flavors (more from my home town then my husbands) but still good. Generally, I would give the wontons a 9/10, the noodles/soup a 7/10, giving the dish an 8/10.   We got the duck and bbq pork with rice too. They were yummy too especially the sauce they put on the rice! Note that its probably made with the duck fat so it would be cholesterol up the ying-yang but so yummy. The curry fish balls and pork ear cartilage were yummy too. Perfectly seasoned!  Ambiance: Its in Chinatown, a mom and pop. Don't expect it to be fancy and if you can not stand a whole duck with the head and all and other meats hanging around, then you may not want to eat here. Take it to go or face the other way if possible.   Price: Fair. Although portion are not the biggest which can make it a bit costly if you want to look it that way. We ordered 3 items for the 2 of us. So go figure.  Parking: Plenty",

    "text": "Items Selected: Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork, Roasted Belly Pork Combo Roasted Duck Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup Roasted Pork and Preserved Egg Congee  Seafood Dry Noodle  Located in the same plaza as Chada Thai as well as China Mama, and on my 'to-do' list since a few days after relocating to Sin City, it was finally on a Saturday evening that I met a friend at Asian BBQ & Noodle - the only two Caucasians to set foot in the place between the hours of 6:30 and 7:45pm proving to be a very good thing.  Tight yet tidy, with a Cash-Only policy that proves no issue as items trend far cheaper than one might expect when considering the quality and quantity of the food, it was at the last remaining table that the two of us squeezed in and navigating the concise menu it was to the amusement of us both that the waitress' eyebrows raised as preserved egg porridge was ordered, not to mention three additional plates.  Waiting mere moments for orders to be prepared, several to-go customers popping in and out as my friend sipped potent iced tea while I opted for water, it was first the aforementioned cauldron of congee that arrived and almost as if to award our \"adventurous\" order the creamy bowl of rice was absolutely chock-a-block full of both crispy pork and blackened egg, each bite a new adventure with baby bok choy, chives, scallions, and mushrooms also joining the mix.  Next brought the barbeque plate, a bountiful trio of meats with crispy belly pork outperforming supple flesh of barbeque and excessively bony duck, it was an interesting contrast to see the same fowl deboned in a steaming bowl of soup fare much better, the skin softened only slightly by broth while long-style noodles were springy and plethoric, a half-dozen tender dumplings fully packed with nicely seasoned shrimp.  Well aware that we had over-ordered, but happy that my friend would have a couple meals the following day at a grand tally of $60 inclusive of tax and tip, it was with a substantial plate of dry noodles that the meal would end, and although the seafood was undoubtedly frozen and rather par for the course, it was the melange of mushrooms that helped to prop up the plate, each featuring a distinct earthy flavor that worked in concert with the vegetables and gravy to offer a flavor both savory and a touch sweet, a nice compliment to the otherwise rich dishes more rich with fatty cuts of meat.  A bit disappointed by the duck and seafood, though universally impressed by the pork, portions, and price there is little question as  to why Asian BBQ & Noodles remains a local favorite, the frequency of return limited only by a somewhat limited menu and several more Chinatown spots to explore.",

The BBQ pork and duck are alright in my opinion, good but nothing to go crazy over.  If you order a two meat combo with rice, you get your money's worth. No question.   I have only ordered off the menu and not off their a la carte buffet. I want to but with the language barrier I am sure it would be too difficult.  However, as much as I love this place I haven't been as much as I would like because sometimes ordering can be very frustrating here. I swear I think they understand me but choose not to. Last visit, I wanted to scream. I was that frustrated. Because of the ordering I have to give this place a 3 star.

We decided to eat here on July 4th (today) and it was packed; had a line going out the door.  Got our number and waited approx. 10 min before being seated: -Half a duck -Hoi Nam Gai Fan -Noodles w/pig skin & intestine When my dad got his plate, we could just hear in the background that they lost our check.  It was kinda funny really, the chaos of a packed restaurant as well as the waiters yelling back and forth of where the check mysteriously disappeared to. (The matter was solved in the end.)",

Service: The servers do not pay much attention to you. If you have questions or have any requests, you have to get their attention as they are moving all around the place. When ordering, we asked a question about the menu, and we got a loud and rude response back. I asked our server for some extra sauce, and her response was, \"They are too busy back there. Can't you see we're very busy? Maybe next time.\" So, I asked a different server and got my sauce.   Food: The food is good. I highly recommend the BBQ pork and roasted pork belly! The meat is tender and the skin of the pork belly is crispy! The presentation for most dishes are decent (for those who enjoy taking photos of their meal like I do). The prices are very affordable, and the portions are satisfying.  Atmosphere: It is a fast-paced environment with tables getting constantly moved around to accommodate various party sizes. It does get rather crowded and noisy sometimes but definitely tolerable.",

Five stars purely because their roast duck, & roast pork is freaking amazinggggg. It is seriously one of the best roast ducks I've ever had (and I'm Chinese American, so that's a lot of roast duck I've eaten in my lifetime).   Other dishes: the shrimp dumpling soup was okay (I've had better), and honestly I don't remember anything else we ordered bc I was having a duckgasm. (That might be flagged for inappropriate content, sorry Yelp).  The restaurant itself is kinda small, seats maybe 50. There's a long table in the back with maybe 10-12 seats, and you have to squeeze by them to get to the bathrooms. But i kinda love the restaurant's small size because it feels like an awesome neighborhood joint.   This place gets busy and stays busy. My party of four went at 2pm on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait bc we took the last open table. The party that walked in behind us had to wait a few min (10min) for a table to open up.   the service is also pretty good! Nice servers, came by often to refill our drinks, clear away empty dishes, got us our specific requests promptly, etc.",

We ordered the roasted pork belly and OH MY GOSH it was delicious! The texture was perfect. It was crunchy on the outside and the inside was so soft. It came with steamed rice & this sauce. The sauce was so good!! It also came with a side of soup. Although the soup was bland, I understand why. It went perfect with the meal...since the meal itself had so much flavor. We loved this place so much that we went back today before we head home. And ofcourse we ordered the same meal & we tried the pig ears...& ofcourse they didn't disappoint. It was delicious as well. We will definitely come back here if we're in town again!!!!",

This establishment was very accommodating and had our two tables set up for us when we arrived. The servers here were attentive and made sure we felt comfortable to enjoy our time together.  We ordered plenty of dishes, but the crispy pork and roasted duck were amazing. The crispy pork had just enough fat and a perfect crisp to it. It wasn't dry or over salted like most places. Same goes for the duck, which was flavorful and nicely glazed. I would definitely recommend these dishes.  The noodle wonton soup was not a standout meal, but fresh nonetheless. The wontons were freshly made but the soup was lighter than what I am accustomed to and the noodles didn't retain much flavor. This made the dish mediocre for me. Maybe next time, I would order just the wontons!  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you want authentic roasted duck and welcoming service.",

Total bill came out to $38.... this is the most expensive Cantonese bbq place I've ever been to. BEWARE: they added a 20% tip to our bill for nonexistent service! Next time order to go if you want to try this place!",

    "text": "We tried this place for the first time tonight as we wanted to try something new and at some point I had bookmarked this restaurant. When we walked in the first thing that hit us was the smell. Immediate mouth watering commenced. The next thing we noticed was how bustling and busy the restairant was. These two things were good indicators, because we loved our food. I got the crispy pork belly plate. The pork was hot and the top was deliciously crispy. It comes with steamed rice and chinese broccoli, which were both dressed with pan drippings, so tasty. My boyfriend had the wonton noodle soup. It is a huge bowl, pho sized. The broth was light. There were plenty of wontons and noodles and the flavors were just right. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu!",

    "text": "Every time I make a trip to Vegas, which is about four times a year, this place is a must stop for the roast pork and roast duck.  The roast pork is probably the best I have ever had... and I grew up in NYC's Chinatown area and now reside in the San Gabriel Valley area of SoCal... tons of Asian restaurants... I only get the BBQ stuff and only get it to go. So can't say too much about their other items on the menu or for their dine in service.    The waiter and waitress I have dealt with have always been nice, and I always seek out one of those two to place my to go order with.  The couple times when I had my disabled son with me, the waitress told me to just go wait in the car and she would bring it out to me. Which was really nice of her....so I can't complain. The cashier lady, I was told is not the nicest ...she does seem very standoff-ish... but I only pay her and that is it.  My gut feeling is that she is one of the owners of the restaurant.... the wife. My five star rating is based solely on the BBQ food and it is very good, at least for the roast pork and duck.",

    "text": "One of the very few good chinese BBQ places left in vegas. If anything, in my opinion, its the best in Vegas.   First of all..... CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Make sure you have cash, otherwise no yummy food for you ! Applies for entire restaurant, not only the BBQ. Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America are down the street, less than 1/4 mi away.  Ok now that's over. This is a nice little place, in the opposite corner (NE) of the same center as Q Karaoke, HK Star, Cue D's, and China Mama. Quite busy during lunch and dinner hours and they close early.   They have a variety of foods, that you would normally find in a traditional chinese BBQ place. Noodles, rice plates, fried rice, veggies, etc. Some of their popular dishes would be the \"Noodle Soups\" with a variety of noodles and toppings or the traditional wonton () or shui jiao () dumpling.   One different thing about this place, that sets it apart from the rest, is their \"Cart Noodle\" (). Originated in Hong Kong, it was originally sold on carts. Noodles were freshly cooked to order, with your pick of toppings ranging from pig feet, pig skin, pig stomach, pig intestines, pig blood, etc (continuing on to beef and chicken parts as well).   This place, gives you a choice of a variety of noodles, and your pick of either 1, 2 or 3 toppings. My favorite combination is Thin Egg Noodles with Pig Intestine, Mix Beef, and Pig Feet.   The noodles will be cooked to a chinese style of al dente (when its done right...) It should NOT be too soft, but not undercooked hard. It should give a nice bite.   Another popular item would be their \"BBQ on Rice\" ranging from Roasted Pork on Rice, BBQ Pork on Rice, Roast Duck on Rice, Combination of Two on Rice. As you can see, they have fresh roasted items avail, hanging and cut to order.   Their Roast Pork is one of my favorites. Priced at a little less than $11/lb for a to-go order (price is different if eaten there), but its a good deal. This is one of the few places in town, that prepare only the belly, vs the entire pig. No bones. All same sizes. Better bang for the buck, right? Crispy bubbled pig skin, wonderfully seasoned, nice proportioned meat to fat ratio, cut to bite sized pieces. Good to snack on (yes ive bought this as a snack) or eaten with your meal !   The guys who cut the items are actually fairly accurate. If you want 1 lb, they will be fairly close on it.   Their roast duck is also a good item to order. Crispy skin, meaty and flavored nicely. Good combination to be eaten with rice or noodles. Can be ordered to-go in half or whole duck.   If none of the above appeals to you, their fried rice and noodles are nicely done as well ! Good \"wok hei\" as what chinese would call it. Its like an extra flavor that appears when you use a high flame and a wok to cook things. Almost imagine it as, maybe a smokey flavor?   Great place for a quick bite to eat or with a few people, or even to go and bring home for dinner",

    "text": "Growing up, my dad had a side job at a meat shop in Chinatown and I was spoiled with the slight burnt, sticky sweet ends of char siu whenever I stopped by as my mom did her grocery shopping. My favorite was when my dad would bring home roast duck though. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water..so succulent and meaty, dipped in a sweet soy sauce that I would drizzle over my rice. I've had authentic Peking duck from Beijing as well, and although delicious, it doesn't trump Cantonese roast duck for me.  We got a half order ($13.99) of roast duck, and I felt like there were more pieces with just skin and fat than there were meaty pieces. It was sitting in a pool of its oily juices, which they could have done a better job draining. The plum sauce (I think?) was thick and I preferred the sweet soy sauce variety. Overall, it satisfied my craving for roast duck, but it doesn't even come close to my dad's. We also got a side order of choy sum and gai lan with oyster sauce ($4.25 each), not knowing that our beef chow fun with gravy ($11.99) would come with a lot of bok choy. Gai lan stalks were still crunchy.  Main reason for the 2 stars is the service. My friend's boyfriend politely asked one of the guys what the difference (implying portion-wise) was between $7.99 roast duck and the half order of it. \"One is more expensive, $13.99, one is cheaper $7.99, so more expensive one has more. So simple!\" The way he said \"so simple\" screamed \"are you stupid?\" and I immediately felt bad as I was the one who dragged them here..especially when the same guy explained something nicely to another Chinese lady right after. I know FOB Chinese people are usually very blunt, but he could've handled it soooo much better. Plus you have to flag them down for everything, and no one refilled our teapot even though we left it open on the edge of our table.  Prices (CASH ONLY) and food are just average. The rude service on top of that? No thanks.",

Just plain good and the broth was; so tasty I could drink another bowl of it.  The pig belly was rediculously good. No wonder they sold out the last 2 times we've tried to buy some.

My favorites beside the bbq roasted items includes egg noodles with duck and shrimp dumplings, clams in black bean sauce (not on the menu), and soy sauce pig ears. Did not like the Chinese broccoli w/oyster sauce. The stems were huge and the leaves were soggy. Guess they had to overcook it to soften the stems. Suggestion to the chef, cut off the stems and cook it longer than the leaves. Service is typical of Chinese restaurant in this area. They take your order, drop off the food, and if you need anything else, flag them down. When ready to pay, go to cashier to get the check total and pay in cash.",

Simply put, the food is going to be as good as it is well received.   For the past 4 years, Yogi and Booboo have made a Christmas tradition of feasting on some duck; roasted, pecking or in a soup. We bid twenty seventeen goodbye with the roasted duck served over this divine sauce that yielded a moist, tender, roast duck. The skin was crispy which is always a plus but the honorable mention is the sauce. It is savory, aromatic, and full of flavor. I love how they provide you with hot tea after you are seated and it is a bottomless serving. My partner in crime gives our meal 4.5 quacks and a tea plus (justincredible).   For every good honorable mention there is also a MEH! We also ordered wonton soup over noodles, it needed more flavor but I respected the dish all the same by finishing it. I will give it another go the next visit maybe it will taste better.   The service is speedy quick and pleasant. I hope to have the same experience every visit.",

This place offers a truly authentic experience, both with food and atmosphere.   The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, the floors are a little sticky, people are densely packed at their tables during dinner hours. There's always a long line of people waiting to get in, with some standing right next to the tables of guests who are eating! Keep in mind, this place is also cash only. But that's how you know the food is going to be some good stuff.   The waiters who take your order are quick and to-the-point, which is understandable considering how busy they are during dinnertime. Admittedly, it is a little difficult to get their attention after you've placed in your initial orders, as they are rushing around to get everyone's orders out.   The food is delicious. I don't know how else to word it to be honest. I always get the soy sauce pig ear as an appetizer, as something flavorful to crunch on before the entrees and rice are brought out. The roast pork belly is tender, with skin crisped to perfection. My favorite dish is the pig intestine, which is flavorful and juicy, with the ideal level of chewiness.   The pricing is pretty decent for the portion size you get, though I have noticed an increase in pricing over the years.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place for those who are focused more on a good, homely meal, rather than a fine-dining experience.",

I've tried their roast duck, pork belly, duck wanton egg noodle soup, Chinese broccoli, spicy chicken feet, spicy pig ears, char siu, and house fried rice.   The duck is absolutely amazing.  I'm going to step out there and say that it's the best duck I have ever had and I love duck.  The meat is moist and tender, the skin is perfectly cooked and the flavor is very balanced.  The ratio of crispy skin and fatty meat of the pork belly is to die for.  The char siu is so savory and tender.  Definitely get the three meat combo, you won't regret it.  The price is very fair so there's no reason not to try it.  On my last trip, I brought back a whole duck because I couldn't get enough (carry-on back to Raleigh lol).    - The Grasshopper",

    "text": "It was all so good! Where do I start!   So this little place was little....  What I got Chinese sausage and salt fish fried rice - it was good. A little bit too dark for me (too much dark soy). Sausage pieces were a little bit too tiny...  Seafood pan fried noodle - was good. Good amount of seafood variety. And the noodles were crispy and nicely pan fried 3 plate combo (double duck and bbq pork) - duck was on the salty end for me. The bbq pork was good! I wish it was a bit warmer 2 plate combo bbq (pork and bbq ribs) - WE GOT A SECOND PLATE CAUSE THEY HAD ROAST PORK! We thought the pork was done for the day but they brought out some so we HAD to get it! And it was worth it. Not too fatty and not too lean. Almost like a 5 layer... ha. Wish it was a bit more warmer.  Garlic veggies - was good. Always love me more veggies!   Environment This place was small! Like it gets busy! It's on a strip plaza, parking can be crazy during busy hours which is around 6-8p, that's when we went at least.   Niceness  It may be the busy-ness that they didn't have time to entertain new comers..... there is menu but really they don't have time to entertain questions. You just have to know what you want. Once you have that down, they are great!   Dollar $ Relatively cheap compared to Orlando at least. OH AND IT IS CASH ONLY PLEASE  Yes? Yea I would definitely go again! Would try the noodles! Seems like it's a street side cart style noodle place where you can pick and chose! Should be interesting!   #WendyTakesVegas #WendyWanders #ALittleLate",

Why I was  over charged? The cashier/manager ignored me, pretending to not understand English. But yet she knew how to speak English when she gave me my total.  I found a Vietnamese waitress, I asked her in Vietnamese why am I being over charged. She said a tray of gai lan is $50 and seafood/vegetables is $75 because seafood is expensive. It was not much seafood, they stuffed it with a whole brunch of bean sprouts and more gai lan(chinese greens) and sprinkle seafood on top.  After getting nothing resolved, I paid for my orders. I will not come back this place again. Very rude & horrible customer service. This is not how you keep customers from coming back. My chinese friends told me $200 was way too much for 3 tray of food and 1 duck.",

    "text": "After dining here for the third time, I can confirm that I like going here for cheap and delicious bbq meat and rice plates.   Pros  Roast Meats: I've only had their roasted duck, barbecue pork, and their crispy roasted pork and I l always find myself ordering the same items because it's that good. The meats are tender and juicy and there's so much salty or sweet flavors going on that you didn't even need the dipping sauces which they include in all rice plates. If you get the rice plates which is a great deal, they'll pour some meat juices on top of your rice with a side of bok choy. I've had my fair share of Asian barbecued meats but there was something magical about their meats that keeps me coming back.   Price: I'm still amazed after all these years with how inexpensive and delicious the rice plates are. There's actually a lengthy number of items to choose from which is great for family style dining but the bbq meats and rice plates are a hit here. Of course prices have increased throughout the years but still a satisfying option while staying on a budget. You'll notice locals, tourist, families, couples, and a bunch of people all dressed up for partying dining here under one roof.   Service: I've never had issues in all the times I've ordered from here. Not as personal but they get the job done and communication is easy with them. They also come by frequently to get your drinks refilled.   Cons  Wonton Noodles: While their wontons noodles are another popular item of choice, I thought it was bland compared to their savory barbecued meats. Shrimp wontons are good but you need some type of condiment for more flavor and the noodles and broth are just okay. However it's still cheap for the price and if you need something warm, order it to share and they'll bring you small bowls if you ask.",

There were plenty of servers but they seemed to be avoiding us.  They were busy cleaning tables.  There seemed to be only one guy seating people and taking orders.  Maybe because the others didn't speak English???  Service during this visit wasn't good.  They even made a mistake with our bill. The only redeeming factor was that the pork barbeque and pork belly we ordered was really good.",

OMG, so good - BBQ roast duck: Really great! Crispy skin, fatty, juicy meat.  - Wonton noodle soup: This is always a great standard if you're craving noodle soup. The broth is light - Seafood chow mein: This is not your typical chow mein from your local chinese joint. The seafood is all super fresh, tender, not overcooked. I'm usually not a fan of squid in most seafood dishes because they tend to overcook it and make it rubbery. But this place knows what it's doing. Everything is cooked to perfection and the skinny chow mein is great - Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce: Get some green in you! Cooked to perfection   Pros: - All the food I've had here has been cooked to perfection. Like superb each and every time. That type of consistency just can't be beat! This is why I keep coming back! - Price is right. I think on average it's about $15/person? Maybe $20 if you get greedy.  - Service is actually really good for an Asian restaurant. Everyone is friendly - Food comes out fairly quickly  Cons: - That wait! Coming at peak times can mean a wait, so be prepared. My friends came in for a really late lunch at 3pm on a Sunday, and that's been the only time there was absolutely no wait. If the wait is too long, just order to go! - Fairly small. Nearly all the tables are 4tops. A few 2tops, and a few tables could be squished together to make 6tops. So try not to bring your nine foodie friends - What kind of restaurant stay closed on Fridays?! Apparently this place is just doing so well they don't need to. So, just be aware of their business hours  Would I come again? YES!",

Was excited to try this; nonetheless, this dish is somewhat underwhelming & salty (and I love salty food) compared to the Asian BBQ joints in Cali (comparing since they post every where the place is one of the top ones in Vegas?)   Also, when I went to pay I noticed they didn't include sweet/sour sauce in the bag so I asked for it. The lady cashier puts in one reluctantly, and I'm thinking one is not enough for 2 lbs. So I asked for another to which she  said \"one dollar\" and I thought, really? The container is half full and it's cheap like ketchup. So service sucks but the 2nd star is for the girl who speaks English who was very helpful and nice, at least. They only take cash.",

She sat us in the back, was very rude taking our order, did not offer us any drinks and never asked if we needed anything else, just brought the bill and left. It's very sad they treat their non asian clientelle in such a fashion .Never felt so discriminated in my life, the food was good but not enough to feel unwelcomed here.",

How shady is that? I understand if they wanted to charge their customers premium on a Chinese holiday. However, you have to TELL people!!!!!! I am sure I am not the only victim here. So I ended up paying 30% tips for bad services.  On top of it, they didn't think it's their fault and blamed on me. I had to literally confront them to get a \"sorry\" from them (but whoever talked to me wasn't sorry at all). Btw, they don't keep records of their business since I asked them to check their records. My guess is this shady Chinese restaurant who probably invades taxes big time with no business records. Hope you get audited soon!!!!!",

I took Janel's advice in her review and went with the double order of the pork for the BBQ combo the second time around.  The crispy juiciness of the meat mixed with the fat was phenomenal.  I've neglected Chinese spots with hanging meat for too long.  I used to eat this stuff at least once a week.      The duck is also tasty but I recommend asking for a breast cut.  Some pieces of the thigh were straight up skin and fat.  While some people appreciate it, I am not one of them.  I also had their chicken chow fun which is something I'll certainly order again.    The service is also pretty friendly compared to most Chinese places around but it's all about the pork!",

Took like 3-4 tries to finally order something because they didn't have what we want but she didn't make that clear the FIRST time just exactly what was all out.  Aside from the mediocre service (it's one of those where it doesn't really matter too much, I guess), the food is excellent! I simply adore the crispy roasted pork. Yummy crispy-ness.  Definitely give the food a try -- lots of yummy BBQ food! They've got a variety of combos to try out but they do run out of their BBQ stuff, so watch out.",

They first put my family of 5 at at a small table that originally fit 4 people, but one wait or eventually moved us.  Service was decent, and actually not so bad. I was happy to see that one of the waiters laughed at a joke my sister cracked (which wasn't funny at all in my opinion) demonstrating that they're not actually bad waiters. One of our other waiters was very confused, and gave us ice instead of rice. Even though she was very confused, she still was very patient with our family.   The reason I gave the restaurant a five because the food was DELICIOUS! I'm not a fan of Chinese food because of the abundant amount of MSG/oil; however, this place was absolutely my favorite Chinese food restaurant. We ordered the roasted pork with rice, congee, mi xao don, and seafood chow foon.   If you're looking for good Chinese food, and don't mind the small, cluttered space than I highly recommend this place! It definitely owns up to its title of being 8th out of 100 Chinese food restaurants in the USA!   CASH ONLY!",

    "text": "Been here a couple times and I've quickly learned that their BBQ meats are the only thing worth getting. Don't get me wrong, their BBQ is probably the best I've had in town, but the other items on their menu? Not so good and I would not get it again.  First thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.  The other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.  Because this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted. If they didn't understand us then why wouldn't they just say so? How rude! Definitely 1 star for service based on my most recent visit! But their BBQ is good and I'll continue coming back just for that, but not anything else though",

Although the soup was so good I'd hate to say anything negative but I do wish flies didn't interrupt my meal every five seconds. (Simple fly paper should do the trick).  A little too close of a dining space but the food made it manageable. I really hope this places delivery is just as satisfactory because I would love order takeout regularly. Definitely recommend.",

We drove to the shopping center next door which has ample parking spaces. It is just a 2 minute walk.  We were seated right away because it was still early, 7 pm. We ordered roast pork and duck combo with rice, choi sum with oyster sauce, and sizzling beef with tomatoes on fried noodles.  The roast pork was a bit dry but the duck is crisp and tender. The choi sum was soft and plenty for a $4.25 plate. The sizzling beef on fried noodles was not disappointing. The sauce was the the right amount not to make the fried noodles soggy.   As usual we did not expect good and attentive service. The servers were doing just an adequate job of taking the order, bringing the tea (instead of water as we ordered) and dishes, and giving us the bill at the end. So, 4-star is awarded.",

And the broth has a deep savory essence which warms the soul. Side dish of BBQ pork and duck were the perfect accompaniment to our lunch. Unnecessary because the soup (at 6.99!) was completely satisfying and generous, but who can resist the BBQ!  Those who kvetch about the service, I guess I don't need to be catered to quite as much. Our server was friendly and efficient, the order was correct, dirty plates cleared promptly. No further lording over required.  Enjoy this place and remember CASH ONLY CASH ONLY and CASH ONLY.

However, this time we wanted something different (and cheap). We were shopping across the street at Jones Market and said let's try it.    We get the ultimate parking space - right against the front door.  Good start.  Then the scary words on the door ... CASH ONLY ... say what?!?!!?   Yep, CASH ONLY!  My wife and I dig through our wallets and find a $20 bill ... OK, we will see what we can share.  2 item combo with rice (BBQ pork and duck) - side of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. 2 free soups.  Out the door for $14.51 -  after tip - $18.00.  Took the $2 chance and went back to Jones Market for some Eastern European ice cream.   Good value - friendly service.   Ignore the sign that the bathroom is out of order - it works fine.",

Their rice was not cooked soft enough. Pretty disappointing steamed rice for it being an Asian restaurant; I mean c'mon guys, it's rice!  They take cash only. Pork belly is served room temperature, which is not ok in my book. The duck was warm, flavorful, and crispy. The bbq ribs were mostly bones and crispy, no meat on the bones and it was over cooked.  Mediocre customer service and below average food.  Probably would not come here again.",

It's unfortunate, but he didn't say sorry and was kind of being a jerk about it. More like I was being reprimanded for not asking first. I just paid and left.

The thing that really wins me over is their fried breadsticks. It is always fresh and hot when they are served. Only problem is that they are not always available. It is always a hit or miss and lately it has been a miss. Also, the restaurant is pretty small and usually busy so it is always overcrowded. There is usually a wait before being seated as well.

The duck is very good but a little more on the lean side which is what most people prefer. I prefer them on the fattier side but the flavor is great.   The wontons are also very good. They have different noodle options so you can order it traditional with egg noodle but can change it to udon or flat rice noodle if you want a change.   My usual order is a 3 bbq platter and a wonton soup.  Service is good for how busy they are but don't expect Michelin star service. This is a great local spot I've been going to for close to a decade now. Hopefully they never change how they do things.",

This place has the best Chinese noodles and Roast Duck, but it's just not worth it with such poor service.  I hate leaving a restaurant grumpy and annoyed and this place does that to me every time because staff is just so rude.",

My only gripe is that the venue is small and if you have to wait, there's no sitting area. You sometimes have to stand awkwardly for a table at the front of the restaurant while other patrons are eating around you.",

Tea: great selection and quality.   Friend ordered combo (repeat COMBO) BBQ stir-fry: unlike this dish in china, it had no meat and no BBQ.  My order: duck plate, likely cut by a blind butcher... Lots of spitting and cursing. They were cheaply cut like inverted and twisted pork ribs-from a professional wrestler named wilbur-but had great flavor. Too much rice.  Our side of oyster sauce veggies was fantastic and there were many awesome soup options. Maybe I was too American in my selection?... I might be back to try soup and pork-something. Maybe I'll try the half-duck they offer, b/c I enjoy pain.  Service was fantastic!",

The tripe and stewed pig ear is a fraction the cost of China Mama and definitely gives it a run.  If only I could sneak in the fresh noodles from Noodle Palace, this place would be a 5.

The roast pork has a awesome crunchy skin and the bbq pork is juicy and succulent. Definitely good for the price and I would order BBQ from here again. They also give you a bowl of soup, this was beef broth with potato and carrots.   We also got shrimp wonton soup with thin egg noodles. The wontons were quality with shrimp, black mushroom and pork. I realized the more I have simple Chinese broth soups the more I feel they're sort've one noted. Just a personal preference, but I think anyone who wants a good wonton noodle soup with some greens will be satisfied.  They serve complimentary tea, which was sort've odd tasting. It tasted like moth balls to me and the BF said it was like spinach water.  Servers was friendly when we were ordering, but I wouldn't say there was much service at all. We weren't ever checked on or refilled, we went to the counter to pay.   BBQ definitely quality and I would order some to-go of this sometime. It's just one of those places that isn't bad, but didn't impress either. It's good for all the things they do and makes for a good cheap work option.",

They also seem very good for soup noodles (), and their menu has a nice guide for customizing your noodles and meats in the way you see fit. Three items are definitely a hearty portion, maybe even two.",

    "text": "If you are hungry and want excellent Chinese food at affordable prices, this is the place to come. It's not the typical fried rice, kung pao, orange chicken fare, this stuff is legit Chinese food.   The most popular dish ordered by non-chinese is the #7 BBQ 2 combo with rice. It comes with peking duck and crispy pork belly that has been deliciously flavored with Chinese five spice powder. Also included is a side of bright green steamed Chinese broccoli. It all sits atop plain white rice that has nicely absorbed the marinade of the duck and pork. It's a complete meal, with your protein, carb and veggie for $7.99.   The pork belly is something to talk about. It has an excellent balance of crunchy skin and moist meat. There are great flavors here with the salty, briny meat and hint of anise which is strong but not overpowering. The duck was the usual and not much to talk about there.   Cash only. Crowded.  The staff who have excellent command of the English language are really friendly, welcoming and approachable. The ones with minimal English are not so friendly and in American terms could be considered to be downright rude. It all is to be taken with a grain of salt. I attribute their rudeness to their inability to communicate. The super friendly demeanor of the English speaking associates help make up for their non-English speaking counterparts.    Located across the street from Wendy's noodle cafe and 168 market. This is one of my favorite little blocks to eat while in Vegas.",

    "text": "If you are in the mood for roast duck or wonton noodle soup or Chinese style BBQ pork, you should visit AB&N. Because of the high turnover, their roast duck and BBQ pork are usually very fresh and juicy. The price for noodle soup is very reasonable too.  Now for some reason, I don't like any of their chicken dishes. The portion is usually too small and there isn't much meat attached to the bones. On the other hand, I think they have the best crispy pan fried noodle in Vegas.  Now for some bad news. If you order noodle soup to go, they always give you a small styrofoam cup of soup, which is not enough to fill up the noodle. I always have to add half can of chicken broth to fully cover the noodle. Second, I'm suspecting that some of the ingredients they put in their soup and sauce might not be healthy if you consume their food regularly. My co-workers used to eat at this place weekly and we would get stomach ache if we ate more than once a week. As for the crispy pan fried noodle, the sauce smelled really funky and strange if you reheat it my the microwave.  By the way, they don't accept credit card, so remember to stop by the ATM on the way here.  Overall, I still come to AB&N when I'm craving for roast duck noodle soup or roast pork, but I try to go here no more  than once a month.",

Knowing the lack of good Peking duck places in Atlanta, he highly recommend that I eat here when my hubby & I first started visiting Vegas 4 years ago.   The roasted duck is a must order. The duck is super flavorful, with crispy skin. that's exactly how the duck should taste and it doesn't disappoint. No wonder it wins top 100 Chinese Restaurant in the US.  We ordered roasted pig and it's also pretty good. But I think my favorite meat here is still the duck.  It's not the best duck place we've ever been to but it's pretty damn good. I mean, we do stop by here and eat every time when we're in town and this is Vegas.",

I just happened to be driving around the chinatown area after running some errands and decided to give this place a try. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping plaza on the corner of Jones/Spring Mountain. Walking in, it reminds of me of a Sam Woo BBQ that I used to go to in Monterey Park - not a huge place, but enough seats if you want to sit and eat, but I did notice most people were getting plates to go.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is that familiar smell of chinese roast bbq and you can see the hanging meat in the glass case full of roast pork belly, bbq pork, and duck. The next thing you notice is the big sign that says \"Cash Only\" so make sure you hit the ATM before coming here. I sat down and ordered a 2 item BBQ combo and got the roast pork belly and duck - it came out with a small side of vegetables and rice. For $6.99 this is definitely a great deal for what you get. For $3 more you can get a plate of chinese broccoli to satisfy your veggie intake for the day. It was so good, I even ordered one to go for my lunch the next day - another 2 item combo of roast pork belly and bbq pork.   I would like to go back and try their wonton noodle soup and other specialties.",

I don't know if any one noticed that this Restaurant automatically added 15% tip to your bill without letting you know. I have to asked the cashier to find out the additional charges on my bill. We're only party of three. I don't mind leaving 15% tip and I was going to do that anyway, but it should be optional. I don't know whether this is legal or not. Please check you bill before paying for it.",

Right as we walked in, we realized we were in for a real treat because we were the only white people in the entire place.  Following the recommendation of our server, I ordered the BBQ pork side dish, and boy am I glad that I did.  The taste of everything we had took me back to my visit to Beijing.  Very authentic, very reasonably priced, and very delicious!",

    "text": "This place was pretty amazing, and inexpensive too! After a weekend of Las Vegas Strip fun, my girls and I really needed some authentic asian food. Yelp to the rescue of course! We dragged our blurry-eyed butts out of bed and headed to ChinaTownLV haha.   It's located in this strip mall so there's plenty of parking..already that's a plus since parking is a pain anywhere on the Strip. It's not much to look at when you walk in but it's surprisingly clean and almost has a Thai feel to it..but it's definitely Chinese. There's Cantonese music in the background and all the workers were speaking to each other in Cantonese as well. Ahh I knew good food would be coming.  Definitely get the roast duck, the skin is so crispy, it crackles when you take a bite. No gross soggy skin here folks! Now if you're a little hung over like I was, I'd recommend getting some kind of soup. There's lots to choose from so just pick a noodle and your toppings and you'll be good to go. If you're lucky enough to be there when they have suckling pig, GET IT. I actually haven't had it but..I'm sure it's amazing as well :D  Service was..well Chinese haha (I can say that because I'm Chinese, I know how we are). Most of the waitresses are hard to flag down and if they're busy, rather than say they'll be right with us they'll just put a hand up and go about their business. Their English is limited though so that may have something to do with it. There was one guy, maybe he was the owner? He was actually very nice and personable. He chatted with people, made sure we got our orders, etc. He should maybe show the other waitresses how it's done.  Anyway, this might just be a LV hang-over tradition for me from now on ^_^",

No.  Just give me my damn delicious food!!! With that out of the way, this is my new FAVORITE restaurant in Vegas!!! I've never wanted to go back to a restaurant the next day but I did with this one.  I was dreaming of their roasted pork belly, roast duck and BBQ pork!!!

Just an FYI, it's only the meat, if you want rice or anything it'll have to be ordered on the side.  For my meat I chose the chicken, duck, and roasted pork belly.  I originally wanted the bbq pork but at the time it wasn't going to be available for another 2 hours.  Out of the 3 meats that I chose, the roasted pork belly stood out the most.  The skin was nice and crispy, and the meat was nice and tender.  The combination of both textures just made it taste so good.  On the side they give you dipping sauces based on whichever meat you choose.  My girlfriend got the wonton noodle soup, which was decent.  There was nothing special about it.  Service is OK, you can expect the same type of service as any other asian restaurant.  Parking is plentiful except when it is later in the afternoon, that's when the neighboring restaurants get most of their customers.    Next time, if I come back, i'll just be getting the roasted pork belly!",

After one bite you just want to keep on going and when you look up from an empta bowl of bbq Duck wonton noodle with a side of roasted pork belly  and choi sum later, you feel like a chubby pig because you forgot to save half for later and now you're overly stuffed a feel sick, guilty and there are no left over for later so you have to get a few Togo orders for later.

If you have had cha siu in SF or HK, you can distinguish the difference in flavor and texture.   We waited at least 40 minutes for our pan fried noodles and beef porridge to arrive. We finished the Chinese donut before the porridge got to the table. Also don't order the porridge if you are expecting Cantonese style congee. This one was watery and had very little  rice. It also had white mushrooms which is really unusual. The seafood pan fried noodle dish was equally disappointing. The noodles were cut up as if the restaurant didn't have enough noodles for the dish.   If you come here, stick with the roast duck or BBQ meat.  You'll get your dish a lot faster.",

It's not a huge place but the service is fast so you'll get your order in a few minutes. Prepare for the wait though because they are super busy and I always have to wait long but I don't mind because their food is always great.   My favorites are roasted duck, roasted pork belly and ginger chicken. They are absolutely delicious and juicy, perfect balance of texture and flavor. They are so flavorful and the crispy textures are just perfect. The combination plate comes with a side of steam rice, veggies, fresh picked radish, soy dipping sauce and onion ginger sauce. They have a lot of options to order different plates. I also order the whole roasted duck and 2 pounds of crispy roasted pork belly for togo and their fried rice is so good too. I always have a positive experience here so definitely recommend it. If you want to eat excellent Chinese bbq, this is the spot.",

We ordered the roasted pork plate and the beef chow mein. 2 items and it took nearly half an hour to receive our take out order, which is pretty bad considering the roasted pork plate only has to be chopped and put in a container with rice. As for the food itself - the roasted pork was really good. The meat was tender and juicy, though I would've liked the skin to be a bit crispier. The beef chow mein wasn't great. There were only a few thin pieces of beef in the dish and it was fairly bland and a little too greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again.   The staff was just...meh. We kind of just stood in front of the cashier for a couple minutes until she finally acknowledged us and took our order. Maybe not the best experience but would possibly come back some time to try some of their other items.",

The restaurant was packed at 11 AM with a line of people waiting for their to go orders. Noticed the hanging pork belly was midway through and knew it was a sign.   For people ordering to-go, head straight to the counter and place your order with the cashier. If you're hungry, order the one option with rice/noodle. If you have a bigger than typical appetite or want to have leftovers for later, get the two options with rice/noodle. Either options come with a small portion of Chinese broccoli.  The crispy pork belly had perfectly crispy skin with tender pieces of meat underneath. Easily one of the best I've ever had. While the roasted duck was just your average duck, the bbq pork stood out to be one of the better ones. It was not overly sweet nor smothered in sauce and while it had relatively no fat, it was still tender.  It's a cash only establishment so come prepared.",

    "text": "Restaurants with genuine Chinese cuisine for me are the ones that are purely about the food rather than interior indulgences, so I did not get put off by a rather humble decor at Asian BBQ and Noodles.   We have ordered Roast Duck with shrimp dumplings in a broth and a combo with pork skin, pork feet, black mushrooms and dry noodles that also comes in a broth. The total price for both dishes (without the tip) was 21.63 USD (a killer deal for the quantity and quality of food that you get). Oh and - important - it's CASH only restaurant.   The broth was pure joy - fragrant, delicious, well-balanced. Pig feet - collagenous, with melting in the mouth bits of meat. Next time I probably will not opt for pork skins - soggy and drifting in the broth is not my fav. Otherwise it was a super yum bowl of food.  I will happily come back.",

That's pretty much the extent of their menu but they do it well.   3 combo bbq (crispy pork belly, duck, bbq pork) Shrimp dumplings with noodles soup Singapore noodles BBQ pork fried rice Choy with oyster sauce  Standout is the BBQ pork. This is the best I've had. Usually places have these weird, dry, radioactive red colored pork, but this was seasoned and cooked perfectly moist and not too oily. Also not weirdly red.   I'd get everything again except the Singapore noodles (too dry and too spicy) and the fried rice (too dry but hubby liked). For the noodle soup I'd try the wonton and noodles next time. The shrimp was more like a fish ball and not whole shrimps.   Service: they speak English and Cantonese but there was one guy that spoke Mandarin and communicated with my FIL. Pretty friendly for a Chinese restaurant and they even gave us extra bowls without us having to ask.   Ambiance: it looks ghetto on the outside, but inside is clean and basic with plenty of tables and the meat on display.   Location: parking can be challenging at peak times since there are a lot of Asian food places in this plaza.   I'll be back when I'm hankering for BBQ pork, otherwise Big Wong's noodle soup is seasoned better.",

Was feeling nostalgic for Hong Kong's Mak Noodle and this place is the closest to authentic wonton noodle soup I can think of in the States.   Decor and service remains the same since the last time I was there. No fuss, in and out, cash only type of joint.  Sadly there has been a change since our last visit: Price has gone up ($6.50) and broth and noodle has gone down. The soup was lackluster. Noodle was slightly overcooked and bland. Quantity of the noodle seems less. However, the wonton remains the same: full of flavor!  Still not too shabby.",

I open the tray with the house fried rice and said to myself, this sure doesnt look like house fried rice... It had bits n pieces of chicken , with tiny fragments of egg. Just a pinch of green onion. So I take a bite and wham....its spoiled. I called immediately and was told at first that they were closed... 8:55pm.. So I explained that my rice was not what I ordered n that it's spoiled.

    "text": "I would make the argument that this place is most authentic Cantonese BBQ in town. You can find your favorite Chinese stir-fries and bbq in here while you admire their unique taste of wallpaper. (You'll understand when you go there) They offer your favorite noodles and meats and are all available to go. They also have a steam table where you can order ala cart items per pound.   The service is very Chinesey: very quick, do not look for super hospitable servers because you're looking in the wrong place. Depending on the type of food you order, the time it takes for it to come out may vary. Stir-Fried dishes take the longest, while BBQ rice places are the quickest.   About the food: After spending about a year trying to find my Cantonese favorites in LV, I think this is my go-to. The barbecue is not the best I've ever had, but its good enough to remind me of authentic Cantonese BBQ. The stir-fried noodles are executed well, and they have the Asian-ey vegetables that I look for when I go out to eat Chinese (Pea Sprouts, Mustard Greens, Baby Bok Choys, etc etc...) I included a picture of their homemade hotsauce, which i wish i can just 'take' every time. The flavor of their sauce reminds me of a hot and spicy hotpot: super fragrant, super depth in terms of spices, and numbing peppercorns!  Recommended Foods: \"Kuai-Fei\" Chicken - poached whole chicken served with Ginger/Scallion sauce Stir-Fried noodles - Chow fun, crispy noodles BBQ Duck, Cha-Siu, Roasted Belly (salty though) Asian vegetables Curried Tendon (super small portions though) Hot Sauce  Reasons why it didn't get the 5th star: Quite expensive for Chinese BBQ while not delivering top quality Cash Only Closes too early @ 9PM CLOSED ON FRIDAYS",

I looked over the menu briefly but talking to my friend. I gave it back and gave it to the pro to order. I took his word for it and about 5 dishes came out.  I wish I knew what they were so I can order them again if I was ever in Vegas.  I know I had BBQ pork, Wonton soup, vegetables on the side, and a couple other dishes as well. The food was really well-made and you can taste how good it was. I honestly am not sure how else to describe. It's one of those things where you have to go there and find out for yourself!

After an afternoon of ingredient shopping for Panang Curry across the street at 168 Market, I was tired, hot, and hungry. Rather than just grab something at the 168 Deli, I wanted to try a different spot.  I pulled up the Yelp App on my phone and Asian BBQ was one of the choices and was just across the street. I've never been there, and heard nothing but good things from Yelpers. I saw the first picture and looked no further. I said to myself \"Self, that's what I want, and that's what I'm gonna get!\"  It looks like nothing from the outside but when you enter, this place is packed with people getting their grub on. Right away, I order the 2 choice BBQ Plate Special ($7.99) of their Roast Duck and Roast Pork. As I peruse the menu, I see Hainan Chicken, and I contemplate on getting a third choice($10.99) The lady taking my order starts giggling because she can see my \"eyes getting bigger than my stomach\" look, and at the same time, I hear R. Kelly...R. KELLY!?!? Yes, R.Kelly, and he's singing (as in the Bump and Grind intro) \"Your mind's telling you NOOOOOO.......But your stomach, your stomach's telling you YESSSSSSSS!\"(Its a BIG sign of hunger when you start hearing things!) I block it all out and stick to my order, and I'm so glad I did because their take out portions are HUMANGOUS!  I get in my car, and it smells SO GOOD, I gotta just have one bite...which turned into another bite, and another one,  and another one! I finally pulled myself together,  turned up the A/C and headed home.  The duck was very juicy and that liquid Elixir of duck love that they pour over the duck and rice is pretty bomb. The pork was crispy with just enough fat and tasty meat too. I ate half the plate for lunch and the rest for dinner.  Can't wait to come back and try their noodle selections which they also have many choices for! Fast, cheap, and delicious, seriously one of the best deals in town.   ALOHA!!!

    "text": "Holy roasted pork belly! This place blew my mind. Man...talk about flawless! These people are Chinese BBQ experts! Their roasted pork belly was tiptop extreme crispy perfection and the moist BBQ pork was also fanastic!  Right when I walked in, the ladies working the front eagerly waved me down and started convincing me that I wanted a lb of everything. It reminded me of walking into a car dealership and approaching the wave of commission based salesmen. Be sure to stay strong or you will succumb to the glorious pork that's glistening right in front of you and end up buying more than you intended.   Initially I was planning on purchasing a half lb of each, but I easily couldn't resist and ended up buying 1 lb of each - roast pork belly and BBQ pork, all for $27.20. They weigh each kind of meat (majority of the time it's a little over what you intended to buy) But, I honesty don't regret buying a little over (unless I was on a strict budget). Make sure to request a copy of your receipt if you need one, they don't give one typically for BBQ take-out orders.   I took one bite and was astonished on how crispy, juicy, and flavorful the roast pork belly was. Wow, can I just say mouthgasm? Nothing in this world can beat an expertly roasted crispy pork belly skin. They make a wining one here with an indescribable magical crunch. They also provide a small container of plum hoisen sauce to dip your pork belly in. They pair perfectly together - perfect harmony of salty and sweet.    As I expected, The BBQ pork was expertly prepared as well. Tender, moist, seasoned well and not over salted. It would be amazing in sandwiches (banh mi), with rice, in egg noodle soup...or hell, served in a boot!   Make sure to bring your cash and your self control! You might need it in here...",

There are lots of signs about \"top 100 restaurants in the US\" from 5-10 years ago, but maybe something has changed -- not a bad place, but nothing special, especially given how many truly great restaurants are in Chinatown within a few blocks.  Cash-only.  Not particularly inexpensive, either -- $10-25/person.  One upside is they open at 10am before a lot of other places.",

The roasted duck....SO JUICY & KEEPS YOU WANTING MORE even when you're SO FULL!! The rice porridge with ginko nuts, is my absolute FAVORITE!!! This has to be one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. Can't wait to come back again. The staff here are so attentive and such hard workers. The atmosphere is homey, it feels like being in my grandma's kitchen...eating, laughing, great energy!",

I have drove by where I see a line forming outside (yikes!).It is not exactly a \"take-you-out-on-a-first-date\" atmosphere, but it is more of a hole-in-the wall.   There are an array of dishes and one can easily order one too many dishes! So, I will provide you with my ALL-TIME Favorites:  Roasted Duck - Crispy skin and thin meat Chicken Rice Porridge - creamy bowl of congee Combination Chow Mein BBQ Pork  I have tried many items on this menu and I can tell you that their dishes are high quality. This is not exactly healthy, but the food here is very authentic and consistent! For the quality of the food, it is quite inexpensive. Trust me, I have been here 20+ times!  Service is great and fast! If you come here and there is a line, go next door for some happy hour drinks or just wait!   Additional Notes: Parking: At peak hours, you may not find parking at night. You can risk parking across the street (you may get a ticket). Cash Only! Closed Fridays",

I am originally from Hong Kong and I really enjoyed their HK style soup noodle (the thin kind).  I tried the soup noodle with 3 toppings (intestines, curry fish balls and briskets) and ordered a rice dish with 2 toppings (bbq pork and duck).    Highlights: 1.  The food was good and priced reasoanbly.   2.  The bbq pork and duck had crispy skins!  They were still hot and tasted very yummy! 3.  Noodles were thin and chewy.   4.  The curry had a kick in it, just the way I liked it!  But, I felt like the fish ball was just OK.   5.  I ordered the milk tea and it was just meh.   6.  The customer service was surprisingly good!  They speak perfect English and Cantonese.    Overall, I think this place provides very good food.  For future improvements, they can definitely try to improve their drinks.  I'll definitely come back here for more authentic Chinese food in future.  Last but not least, the bathroom was clean as well!",

Also had their poached chicken congee wich chinese rice cruller (yau tew) So authentic. Fried up perfectly and soft and bready on the inside.

Chicken and Salty Fish Fried Rice - huge portion, definitely big enough for two. Add a little of their chili and its to die for. Crispy Seafood Noodles - again very big portion but I eat the whole thing by myself because it is that good! Again add their delicious chili and its extra delicious.  I have also tried their porridge, very smooth and perfectly seasoned, their bread sticks go really well with the porridge.  I also usually get an order of their signature Roast Pork, Mixed Intestine, Curry Fish balls.  I have tried other items but these are the ones I also go back to!   The place gets very crowded, not great for large parties.. they only have the middle section where they can put tables together but if you come with a party larger than 8... chances are they do not have enough tables to put together.  Typical service for a place in Chinatown but the staff are great, they are quick with cleaning tables, quick to bring out drinks and quick to take orders. They are very organized, staff are always on top of cleaning tables and seating guests.   Will definitely continue to come back, for the great food and for the price!!",

We ordered a plain wonton (not so good), Hainan Chicken - white meat (delicious), char Sui & roast pork (very good).  The comfort food really hit the spot & the prices were very reasonable.

The portion size was large and it was everything I thought it was going to be -- tender chunks of fatty pork with crispy skin on top of a huge helping of rice. It was excellent all the way around.  It's CASH ONLY! and it's also closed on Fridays. I thought I had enough cash on me but was a dollar short. I read other reviews where the dish was $5.50. Now it's $6.50. So, I had to find an ATM.

The roast pork is cooked well, the skin is crunchy to perfection; while the bbq pork has just the right flavoring without being overwhelming or seemingly artificial.  The roast duck also is just perfectly juicy and delicious without a hint of being gamey or even tough.  Be aware, this is also your typical chinese spot.  It's also very busy.  At best it's like a zoo, at worst, a complete cluster.  If you can, I suggest a to-go order.  But if you're brave and willing to give it a shot, snag a table.  Sure, someone might jump ahead of you in the queue but that's par for the course.  Service is utter crap but you're not here for fine dining and to be treated like royalty.  You're here for the awesome meat to feast upon and then get out.",

    "text": "One of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to! We went based on Yelp reviews. The restaurant is clean and staff are efficient. They have a great display of freshly made bbq roast pork, roast pork, roast duck. We ordered kai lan with oyster sauce, thick egg soup noodles with fried fish balls, a plate of bbq roast pork and beef on crispy noodles. Everything was very fresh and well presented. The chef who chopped the bbq pork appeared to take great pride in making sure each piece was chopped equally and arranged perfectly on the plate - he even came out to check we were happy. The restaurant clearly takes pride and cares about its food. Definitely worth a visit!!",

This place is cash only and small.  Once you walk in you can tell you're going to have a good meal because everyone is chowing down and smiling. I decided to order the roasted duck and roasted pork combo with veggies.  It was delicious.  The pork was nice and crispy and the duck had a lot of flavor.  It was nice eating a simple meal.  My fiance had the wonton noodle soup with bbq pork.  He said his meal was enjoyable also.  Thanks yelp for helping me find a great place to eat while on vacation.",

The roast duck was too greasy for words; came to the table literally drowning in grease (and I know duck is a greasy protein, this was ridiculous though). The won-ton soup tasted like fish, which is a first for me in any won-ton soup I've ever had. The pork belly was decent, but came out only lukewarm. The dry beef chow fun was the only edible item we received, and that was greasy and lacked flavor.  Maybe I just don't \"get\" authentic Chinese food, but the food here was just NOT good.   Based on the reviews, I thought I was in for a treat. I thought the same thing when I saw we were the only non-Asian people in the place. This place failed to live up to the hype, and I would NOT recommend it at all!",

They speak both Vietnamese and Chinese so it was interesting for us to order in both languages and have the server understand both! Their roast pork is great as well as their Chinese broccoli. The seafood pan fried noodles were fantastic as well as the Roast Duck. The atmosphere is what I am familiar with meaning: loud conversations, hearing the kitchen chatter when the doors were moving due to the people transiting between the dining floor and kitchen. Overall, I really enjoyed eating and stopping by this establishment. I hope anyone who likes Chinese food stop by. No stereotype American Chinese/Vietnamese food here!",

    "text": "I have to give it 5 stars for what it is and what I ate. My guy server really didn't understand me and in turn, I have no idea what he was ranting about. Something about fried rice, which I had no interest in at the time, something about a prime rib buffet, Honestly, I do not know, but we got the right food and it was on point!    We originally were taking food to go. Our kind gentleman server informed us that the roasted duck was going to be another 20 minutes, my husband wanted that duck,  Bad! So we waited and ordered food to eat in, in the mean time.   We ordered won ton soup with pork belly instead of duck, we also ordered pork ribs. and fish balls. Before the food got there, I realized we didn't not have enough cash for my husbands hunger and cravings. My husband orders food like he's on death row.  I proceeded to go to BOA , just down the road. (It's cash only) OK, so by the time I came back, my husband and my 6 year old daughter decided since they ate all the pork belly that they needed to order another one before I got there. They were raving about how great it was, my husband was in a pig heaven sort of a trance and my daughter was hoarding pork on her side of the table. Seriously, my husband was in awe of the pork belly. I have never seen him so excited and patiently waiting his duck. \"Ingrid, please come look at the pork with me??\" \"No. Andrew, I can see the pork from here.\" Look at it, look at it, please!!\"? \"It's OK, I can see it, Andrew.\" That was our bbq banter. He finally gave up and decided to go stare at the glass of hanging meat and drool. If you cant tell, he really loved that pork belly!! And he was right to love it. It had a perfect crispy skin, tasty pork and not overly fatty.  The fish balls with curry sauce were good. We had to get 2 orders because my daughter did not want sauce. We ended taking most of them home. They were good, just not great. The soup was a super large portion and was pretty good, clean tasting and the noodles and won tons were not soggy and pretty perfect.   My daughter wanted rice so we got a small side of rice and they brought out some kind of duck sauce. I absolutely loved that sauce and the rice was perfectly cooked. By the way, the lady who brought out the rice was so kind and polite. To go we ordered the 3 meat combo for 12.99, I believe.  Since my husband realized it did not come with rice, he ordered a duck and rice combo for 6.99. Needless to say, yes this is a pretty inexpensive place, but the fact that my husband has no self control when it comes to pork, our bill was about 49.00 dollars, 10 dollar tip, but we had so much food, enough for his late night munchies and lunch AND dinner the next day. It was an excellent value. We definitely will be back. It was yummy!!",

It was good but my date and myself agreed that the noodles weren't as good as we had eaten at other places.  I don't think that it is fair to give it a bad review but I also thought that the menu was kind of hard to understand.  Maybe it was because it was my first time there but it wasn't really straight forward to me.  Service was standard, nothing out of the ordinary.",

    "text": "Get the roast pork for sure you won't be disappointed.  Nice and flavorful (unlike some places where the pork isn't tasty and you know they probably parboiled it) and with the good skin.  Char Siu was ok but as a Hawaii transplant it still feels different.  I think  I'm gonna give this place a 4 simply because even though the pork dishes are obviously tasty and well marinated, it wasn't straight from the roaster (as opposed to say if you went to Chinatown and got some fresh roast pork and char siu right before lunchtime...they're still hot and juicy inside.... mm that's hard to beat)  Anyways, we were here for dinner.  we also tried the ribs, ginger chicken,  shrimp fried rice, and some bok choi.  Ok, standard..  Pretty inexpensive tho so overall it's pretty good.  It's clear that the pork is the key here (as if all the pork hanging up in that case with a guy chopping his cleaver constantly isn't a clear sign)    Probably will come back again sometime to try the kau yuk and roast duck.  But if you want some roast pork (maybe you can call or something to see if they just put some out?) then this is a good place to hit up.",

    "text": "Roast duck, roast pork, and char siu!!  It doesn't get any better than Asian BBQ & Noodles.  I'm not just talking about Las Vegas, it beats places in Hawaii, LA, and SF!!  I know this is a bold statement, but this place is the best I have been to.  The roast duck is succulent, juicy, and done to perfection.  Even the Jus that comes with the duck tastes awesome.  I don't know what blend of spices they use, but it is mouthwateringly delicious.  The best part is, its not overly greasy and oily like duck from other places.  I don't feel as if my arteries are clogging as I'm eating.  The roast pork is divine.  The skin is perfectly crunch, but not so thick that you chip a tooth (my dad did that once, not cool).  The pork is also seasoned with the same or similar spices as the duck.  First time I've had it done this way.  Adds an added flavor profile not found anywhere else!!  The char siu is very flavorful.  Sweet without being too sweet.  Some of the best char siu I've ever had.  Writing this review is making my mouth water.  There are many other dishes to try, but I have yet to sit down and try one of their noodle bowls.  One of these days, but for now I'm good with taking a duck to go.",

I did not have to wait forever to get my food.  Also, the food was fantastic.  I had shrimp dumpling soup, gai lan with oyster sauce, roasted duck, bbq pork and crispy pork.  Everything was served at the right taste, neither too salty nor too oily.  The only downside would be the temperature of the pork and the duck.  I wished they had been served at the right temperature.  Whatsoever!  They were all yummy.  The thing that strikes me most about this place is how polite the staff are.  This is not a noisy, yelling-based Chinese restaurant, which gives this place a big PLUS ++++.  I love Asian BBQ!!!",

Not to take anything away from the other BBQ offerings, but the duck was a total stand out.  And who would have thought the best duck would be in Vegas.  Impressive to say the least.  But I've seen many great places come and go in Las Vegas.  One spot that comes to mind, \"Shanghi Noon\" next to Pho Kim Long.  I miss that guy's noodles so much.  I wish I knew where he went because I am sure he's making noodles somewhere.  Then there was the Vietnamese restaurant on Spring Mtn. & kissing the 15.  He had the best cat fish & pineapple soup noodle.    So, moral of the story, enjoy these places while they are around because these little gems do fizzle out, eventually.",

We arrived & there were only 2 groups of ppl before us, so the wait was only short (5 mins).  Ordered a combination platter of bbq pork, roast duck & roast pork, wonton soup, wide egg noodle with fried tofu & curry fishball - they were all well above our expectation.  We especially love the bbq/roast combination & wide egg noodle. The skin of roast pork was crispy & tasty, the pork was moist, roast duck was fragrant.  The noodle was al dente & sauce (oyster sauce??) was tasty, simply delicious. Service was fast. It's a very typical cantonese/Hong Kong bbq style restaurant which we love.  Great food, fast service, unpretentious, ohh and it's cash only.",

You can choose from a variety of noodles, so I chose the thin Chinese Egg Noodles - they were pretty bland.  The wontons were really tasty, though.  The duck was flavorful as well, but it only came with a few pieces and most were bone.  Friends got different soups as well - they have a combo where you can choose one to three different toppings (but most were things I don't eat like chicken feet, intestines, etc) on dry or soupy noodles.  Do not get the coffee here - it's from a powdered mix and they do not use condensed milk.  I was really disappointed - what a waste of $3.  Overall, a good place if you're craving some noodle soup - the place is Viet/Chinese.",

    "text": "This kind of Asian restaurants made me regret moving away from Vegas.   My folks were tired of their tourist group dinners after traveling in the US for 10 days and just wanted something light and homey. So, being the wonderful daughter I am, I snuck them out in the dark and off to the Chinatown.   Asian BBQ & Noodles must be a relatively new establishment since I don't recall seeing it in the same strip mall where HK Star is at, which I visited a few times in my Vegas days.    The waitress greeted us in Cantonese without hesitation, and I knew we were in for some authentic Cantonese delicacies. The menu items are similar to what you would get in many great small eateries in the back alleys of Guangzhou or Hong Kong.   To address my folks' distressed stomachs, I ordered boiled baby bok choy with oyster sauce, pickled daikon radish, one of the speciality rice porridges and plain rice noodle soup. They were all nicely done and so very comforting. Since Cantonese Style Rotisserie (or BBQ if you are not too hung up on the strict definition) is their speciality, I could not resist the roasted pork belly and it was near perfection. They ran out of roasted duck before we had the chance to try it.   It was around 8PM on a week day and this place was packed with Asian patrons. Service was casual but very efficient. Cash only.   I have never had a better meal for the tiny amount of money we spent. My folks were so proud of me that they have forgiven me for all the headaches and disappointments I have brought them.",

    "text": "The ultimate Asian cheap eats joint in Las Vegas that delivers on every level.  Authenticity- here you will find old school Hong Kong barbecue where the meats are hanging off the racks  with oil dripping off their skin like LeBron James sweating in the 4th quarter leaving behind a beautiful glistening sheen enveloping juicy meat-tastic goodness that is sliced to order.  If you are rusty on your Chinese, be prepared to point at the numbers of each food item you are interested in partaking.   Texture- nice chewy noodles in their soups, perfectly fried skin cradling the underside of an entire backside of pork belly, the appropriate amount of spring to their wontons and fishballs, they definitely get it right with every bite.  Flavor-  No dish is subtle as each ingredient provides depth of flavor yet avoids becoming overpowering.  The wonton noodle soup is well balanced in terms of it's fish-stock like broth yet a dash of red vinegar or chili oil is permissible if not encouraged.  The meats are well seasoned to be eaten straight up but for added layers of flavor explosion, virtually all are accompanied by their own appropriate dipping sauce.  Even the rice that accompanies the bbq dishes and the hainanese chicken are packed with additional notes of spice and seasoning.     Value- A friend and I paid 4.99 for a steaming bowl of wonton noodle soup (6.99 to add some generous pieces of duck), 6.99 for a combination barbecue rice plate (seasoned rice, chinese greens, and freshly chopped roasted duck and fried pork belly) and 3 dollars for chinese broccoli coated with oyster sauce.  We had a smorgasbord of street eats before us that left us more than adequately stuffed for less than 15 bucks/person.  With my parents and their friends retired in Vegas, this is their go-to place for a nice thrifty meal or to purchase takeout meats for their potluck dinners.    Come hungry, bring cash, and leave happy.",

    "text": "Walking in, I noticed a slightly small, crammed space still with tables available around 7PM on a Tuesday. In the middle of the space is the magical BBQ window with roast pig and duck hanging behind it, with staff busily shouting and chopping away like in a Chinese market (i.e. if you're looking for someplace legit, you have hit the jackpot without even having to make a bet!!) The staff speak Chinese and Vietnamese, and the menu is in those languages too! We ordered: -\"hai san\" chicken which is a small portion but appropriate for the low price -roast pork, which is cut up in very small pieces. The taste is not excellent but I will say it is very good and comforting. -congee with seafood. Again like the roast pork it's not excellent but it's pretty darn good for what it is. The portion size is also appropriate with the low price. -chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. For only $3.50 you get a very small, efficient portion which fed my party of three perfectly. You can always order two portions if you have a bigger party. Food was brought out very quickly, with the exception of our congee which our server warned us about wait time beforehand.  A nice perk of this restaurant is that although it reads \"Cash Only\" outside, there is also no tax added onto your check. I appreciate this gesture as they are passing on their own savings to their customers! I'll be back for sure next time in Vegas.",

The BBQ pork was much better in my opinion but it is a little sweet.  The rice was cooked perfectly and they drizzle a little sauce onto it.  They also gave a bowl of soup for each order of rice which tasted okay.    We ordered a side of spicy pork ear which sounds nasty but it was good and definitely worth a try.  The roast pork noodles didn't look too appetizing.  The noodles looked a little discolored.",

When we arrived, we discovered that we went to the 8th best Chinese restaurant in America (for 2011)!   Really?  That is what their signs stated.  They had signs everywhere saying they were #8.   Between the Yelp reviews and the their award for being the #8 Chinese restaurant in the USA, we couldn't be wrong.     The owner of the restaurant is a genius for jumping on the pork belly bandwagon.  This is the only place that I have seen that hangs roasted pork belly instead of a whole pig.  Is it the best that I have had?  No.  But, it was good.   We also tried their duck.  Their roast duck was had a good flavor, but, did not have much meat on it.    Their noodle soups and lo mein (dry noodles) were good.  The soup was decent.  Their lo mein which comes with a special sauce, and costs $1 more than the soup noodles.  Wontons were good.  The only complaint I have is that they do not give enough noodles.  Even my 8 year old daughter finished a bowl of noodles all by herself.  She normally is a very small eater.    Overall, this is a pretty good Chinese restaurant.  Yelpers were not wrong with this one.  When I go to Vegas again, I need to come back to this place.    Edit 4/12/13  Asian BBQ & Noodle is better than the Chinese BBQ and won ton noodle joints in the East San Gabriel Valley.  They beat the Rowland Heights Sam Woo.  Not sure how they compare to the same type of restaurants in Alhambra and Monterey Park.  It might be better than #8.  After comparing it to some of my local restaurants, I am going to upgrade them to 4 1/2 stars.",

I ordered the duck wonton soup to ease the fever I was hosting that day. And the BBQ pork and duck plate was for my boyfriend.   The soup was fairly salty, as all duck soups tend to be. Won ton was average. But, that crispy fatty duck was soooooooooooooo worth every every single non customer service stares I got that day.   I absolutely loved it.   The BBQ pork was off the hook, too.   Maybe it was the fact that I haven't had either dish since moving out of Hawaii but, boy oh boy...I'm glad I was sick and saw that on someone's IG feed.

This passed weekend was my son's first birthday party, I ordered 3 lbs of pork, two full chickens and one tray of fried rice. I asked to pick up at 11am. By 10:50 They forgot to do my fried rice, when I got home, this is type of chicken I got for paying $20 a box. THIS IS JUST A SHADY MOVE. They gave me all the neck, fingers, butts from others leftover, there's NO meat of what we can actually eat. its Disgusting this is how they treat a loyal customer who is doing a cratering purchase. I guess we don't find out what's inside the box until we get home and there is no refund. #shitty",

I have had the BBQ pork (which has a slight sweetness to it), roast duck, pork belly, and chicken. All were good. I have also had all of them on their own (not in soup).  A bowl of soup will set you back about $10. Always a must is the Chinese broccoli. It is so sweet, tender yet crunchy, and so good for you. The price is $4.50. They are closed on Fridays so obviously don't go on that day, but if you do there are plenty of other great spots to eat in that shopping plaza. They get crowded at lunch time and you will have to wait for a seat, as the occupancy is only 50 people.",

Located in China Town in the corner of this plaza. The place isn't big but sure was crowded. My friends and I ordered crispy noodle, two plates of fried noodles and BBQ pork/Crispy pork. I thought the combination pick two or three was on the pricier side compare to other similar restaurant.But everything else in combine is still pretty cheap especially when you're eating in Vegas.  Crispy pork def did not disappoint me. The skin was nicely roasted, crispy and flavorful. Meat isn't dry at all! Pair with the crispy pork sauce. It fulfilled my taste bud for the month. I regret not to pack some back home.   We got vegetable noodle and seafood noodle. Both were good and not too oily. Thought the portion was not as big but still pretty fulfilling.   Crispy pork was def one of the highlight of my Vegas trip!! I will come back next time to try more + crispy pork when I visit!!!",

Today I ordered the food to go because we are going to be watching a show on TV and wanted to have some comforting food. There was barely anyone in the restaurant because I went there early. When the food came out, I asked for 4 sets of Chopsticks and plates since we have 4 people, the lady at the cashier register told me we are too wasteful, why don't we just use the two sets of Chopsticks and spoons for your 4 people.  I ask her how is that even sanitary and it is extremely inconvenient. We purchased nearly $50 worth of food and she cannot spare two more sets of Chopsticks and to go plates? The worst part is she was telling me then don't go eat there.  Wow, really? I feel stupid that I even recommended this restaurant to several of my friends who visit Las Vegas.

If you are looking for some wholesome chinese food that feels like home, this is the place to be! Its tucked away in a plaza and is a little small and there might be a wait but its worth it!   Pros: - We ordered so much food here! We had there rice noodle stir fry that was definitely a favorite of mine! I love the oil and grease on it cause thats how its supposed to be served! The beef and shrimp went perfectly with the dish!  -  I love egg noodle soup with wontons so I orders a bowl for myself! Wontons were very flavorful and delicious and not overcooked. The broth was a perfect balance of sweet and salty and the meatballs were tender as well!  - We had order the BBQ pork which was amazing!! I loved the crispy skin and fatty meat which just fell apart in your mouth. This dish is a definite must when you come here! It also comes with a side of sauce which I didnt prefer but give it a try!  - The BBQ duck was on POINT! The skin was glistening from the flavor and sauce and the meat was so tender and juicy! Not dry at all and the skin was light crispy! Loved the dipping sauce that came with it!   Mehs: None  Cons: None  Tip: Being asian, Im used to going to restaurants and having the staff barely talking to me and just keeping it short with the interaction. I dont mind that at all because I just want to order my food, eat, pay and leave. If you don't care about the employees asking you how your day was or if youve ever been here or what not, then yep this is your typical asian restaurant.  If youre not used to that, dont take it personally. they just want to serve you quickly and efficiently!",

Ironically, my wife and I had watched Okja the night before so she felt guilty when she saw the pigs and ducks being slow-roasted. She said that she would never eat pork again, but after being pressured into trying the roasted pork belly, she reverted back to eating pork again lolol. Shit, I don't blame her, because it was some of the best pork belly I've ever had! The cuts were thick. The skin was super crispy, and the meat was so moist, tender, and flavorful.  We also tried their duck and wonton egg noodle soup and fried rice. They were good but nothin memorable. But OMG that pork belly. I recently saw a picture of it, and I was inspired to write this review right now haha. For those of you who haven't tried this place, make sure to order the roasted pork belly.

Take advantage of the hot chili oil on your table. The only complaint is that the bbq can sometimes be overly salty. After my meal I'll be super thirsty, so I don't eat here as often as I'd like.",

What I don't get is that my order was relatively simple; fried rice, chow fun and chow main simple - yet I've been waiting 30+ minutes! Seriously, what the hell?! I get it, it's busy as hell,but how are people that are coming in and placing their orders after me getting their food first?! After for what seemed like an eternity, or spending a good time reflecting on my life choices up until that point, the food was ready to go.  Now for the food itself, or what I ordered at least. It was pretty damn good.  The pork fried rice was spot on! Not salty or too oily, much different from any other Chinese food joint out here in the valley. As for the chow mein and chow fun, the balance between noodles and veggies complemented each other very well, very reminiscent of the quality you would get out in San Francisco - kudos!  To sum things up, the food is definitely great and is worth another visit. For my next visit, I'll more than likely dine in and not go when it's not so busy. I'm not willing to go through DMV style wait times because that's what DMV is for. One more note, bring cash! It's cash only!",

The engaging signs all state that they made it top 8 of chinese restaurants in America. Humble in the sense that they claimed 8th and nothing higher. But there lies the problem, because the foundation which claims to hold these rankings and oversees the validity...is none existent and disbanded on the worldwide web. Don't fall victim to awards and celeb endorsements as they often mislead us but unless its a Michelin Star which I personally feel has the ultimate validity.   In terms of the shrimp shui gow soup and the fried rice I had...it was weak in flavor. But decently priced. I just have a bewildering time that any restuarant or business would blatantly boast its prestige. If anything they may have been duped. I would try it again but strictly for the Chinese bbq...looks promising.",

The bad: simply too expensive for what you get. $14 for about $9 worth of bbq, at least in terms of what I would get at my favorite place in Atlanta. Duck wasn't warm enough, either.   It is cash only, which is a pain. Overall, a forgettable experience.",

We've waited for almost 50 mins for the fried rice.  Can you believe it? The lady who works at the counter ignored my friend's question on how much more time we need to wait just because she doesn't speak Cantonese.  After I complained, the other lady suggested me to call first, I told her I did but no one answered!   My points were, 1. if you know it takes time for the fried rice, why don't you just tell customers and let them decide if they want to wait or change the order? 2. If you don't pick up the phone, don't suggest customers to call first. 3. Don't be so rude to your customers!!  I'll never never never go there again even though it's highly recommended. I don't care if their pork belly is the best among those Chinese BBQ restaurants.  I bet they don't even care for losing one customer.",

I will usually come here for their wonton noodle soup, it's simple and perfect for when I'm feeling under the weather. I also really like their bbq pork, chow fun, and fried rice.   The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I don't feel that it is the cleanest restaurant. They keep their chopsticks and spoons on the table to grab yourself and often times, I'll get one that has peculiar residue on it.",

Pretty quick for our orders and it was delicious. I would like to try more of their food next time. The only thing I don't like is that they only take cash.. which I rarely bring cash with me otherwise it was a first good experience for me. And maybe because they have good food they can expand their resto.. it's cramped inside, simple and typical chines restaurant. Their utensils, plates are in the way, so the place is already crowded and small but they still put them in some walkways... that has to be some sanitary issue as well..!. Coz people can bump or Pass by to it. But with food. It's yummy l!",

I told her I would be back next month to try it out. She said that if she was in town, she would join me. Lucky me that she was and we were able to dine here together!   When we arrived, they were busy with a line out the door. We signed in the first chance we got and waited. The restaurant was full of Chinese people so that was a good sign. This place is cash only so make sure to have cash or get cash while you wait to be called. Jean gave some recommendations as we looked at the menu while waiting so we went with what she recommended when we ordered.   We ordered Chinese Broccoli w/Oyster Sauce, Fried Tofu (was sold out), Roast Duck Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup and BBQ 3 Combo Platter (Ginger Chicken, BBQ Pork and Roasted Belly Pork). The meal came with hot tea. Table was clean and customer service was good for a Chinese restaurant. I didn't expect this at all TBH.   The shrimp dumplings were plump and duck was good. Noodles had the right amount of chewiness and broth was good. I really liked their saute sauce and added it to every bite. BBQ Pork and Ginger Chicken sauce was good but the Roasted Belly Pork was just ok. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we had lots of left overs. Thank you Jean for the recommendation and I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "I remember... when I used to live in Vegas, this plaza was pretty empty and the only restaurant my family frequented was a quick teriyaki take out joint.   Several years later and it seems to have brought in many different types of Asian cuisine.   This was our second great find of EDC weekend. We were supposed to get pho but I stumbled on this page while searching and couldn't resist after seeing the bbq, noodles, and jook or congee.   Being the driver has it's perks such as making an executive decision to hole in the wall restaurants on the whim.   This time we went into the restaurant with a party of 7. They had no problem seating us. Half way into the meal people started filling up the restaurant. It seemed like we just beat the rush.   We sat down got our menus and some hot tea.   The waiters passed by us several times as we were ready to order. We had that foreigner veil over our table and service will seem to be slower than if I were to be with my parents. No big deal, it's something I've gotten used to.   Eventually I am able to wave down a waitress. I exercised my Cantonese and ordered as many of the dishes I could recognize. The waitress had no problem taking the orders in English but dropping some Chinese usually makes the service a bit better. It's not guaranteed.   We ordered a lot of food to share, family style. BBQ pork and Duck, Combo fried rice, Beef chow fun, Seafood pan fried noodles, a bowl of congee, and 1 bowl of wonton noodles for me and a bowl of braised beef noodles for my friend.   The first item to come to the table was the fried rice. My friend said it smelled sooooo good as the waitress set it on the table. And it really was good. Everything was great. But I would have probably skipped the beef chow fun and I felt the braised beef was better than the wonton noodles.   In the end I ordered too much. We still had a lot of bbq pork and roast duck left over so we boxed it up and took it back to the hotel. After a long nap the next day, three of us devoured the left overs like primitive hungover cavemen; in our dark, curtain covered, cave like hotel room.  Sadly they ran out of roast pork just before we ordered. I actually want to bring my parents here to try it next time.",

However, it was sooooo cold and windy that it was the perfect weather to try this new joint for some wonton soup. It was pretty packed when we got there and there was a wait after we got seated. I decided on the roast duck and shrimp dumplings. The fiance wanted the roast duck and wonton. When it came out, I noticed that my duck was still a bit pink....pretty sure that's ok, but I get a bit paranoid with that kind of stuff...so I didn't eat it. Shrimp dumplings were good and the noodles were ok. Broth didn't have very much flavor and was VERY oily. I was disappointed overall and I think I will be back to try the BBQ pork, but for the wonton soup, Wendy's Noodle Cafe has the best wonton noodle soup!",

We also ordered a side of 3 bbq meat combo plate:  bbq pork, soy chicken & bbq duck.  Very good bbq meat dish.  Quick and fast service.    The 2nd time was a bit of a hit and miss.  It was at around 6 p.m. and it was hopping busy.  We managed to find a table in the far corner of the restaurant.  Relieved to even get a table at this busy time.  They messed up on the order and we had to wait a bit for the food but it was all good.  I'm not sure if I would come back again 'cos it's so busy.  I ordered the beef tendon and curry fishball with wide egg noodle soup.  It was a little sparse for the price.    Don't forget:  only cash here.",

Inside you got the hanging proteins in the glass mirror,  Chinese people everywhere, some bamboo plants, and its brightly painted walls. Its simple and plain, but it gets the jay oh bee DONE.   If you aren't familiar with Chinese BBQ then I would recommend the BBQ pork or \"char siu\" because its ridiculous. How ridiculous you ask? More ridiculous than anything that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. ALSO try the roasted duck, its juicy, succulent, and made fresh several times a day. Actually better yet just get the BBQ pork and roasted duck in a combo, with rice, noodles, or just by itself. If you're feeling extremely gluttonous, spend $20, get the whole duck to go, and just go primal animal on it at home in private, don't worry I won't judge.  If you're feeling adventurous well... there is the pork blood and intestine... but lets just stick with what's solid.   I don't love the stir fry noodles (your chow fun, chow mein, etc) here, but if you're craving it, it will do. The roasted pork is also a favorite among everyone, but I don't really enjoy its fattiness combined with the crispy skin, however if you do, go at it!   The service... well with most decent Asian restaurants, if you don't speak the language, then keep it simple, no point in confusing the work staff, or/and making yourself flustered.   Cash only and its pretty clean in here (+10000 points).",

Tucked away in the same area as Q Karaoke, District One, and Icy Juicy and you'll find this joint. Not really a name or a nice sign that the normal eyes could see but it's one of those places where you'd have to stick your head in and see what this place is all about.  First and foremost, this place is CASH only. Secondly, this is an asian restaurant so don't be expecting top notch 5 star service.  The food. Poultry and meats are prepared in the back and hung in display out front chinese butcher shop style. One of the best roast ducks I've had in Sin City. I'm not usually a fan of roasted pork belly but I'd order it here because it's so damn good. Juicy inside and a nice crunch on the outside.  This place is not your ordinary chinese restaurant as you won't find dim sum or any exotic chinese or seafood dishes here. It's more for the simple person to enjoy to get in and out quickly. Prices are reasonable as well. Great place, I will be coming back.",

You definitely don't go here for service and you can't be shy or nice coming into this place, I learned that if you approach them and talk as firmly as they do, you establish some sort of connection and they'll have your food out faster. The food here is amazing! If I'm feeling like a soup, their Wonton Noodle Soup has a light flavor and has a great portion. The Roast Duck and Roast Pork is a must try if you go here. I buy pounds of them for dinner, snacks and parties. The Roast Pork is especially my favorite. The Roast Duck is accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce and the Roast Pork is accompanied by hoisin sauce.  It can also be eaten with rice. My all time favorite dish here is the Salted Fish & Chinese Sausage  Fried Rice. Only try it if you can handle a strong fishy taste! Overall the quality and taste of their food is amazing and the prices are just right. Just note, this is a Chinese restaurant so expect oily, greasy foods, but it's less compared to other chinese restaurants. I highly recommend you try this place if you haven't. One of the most authentic chinese restaurants you could go to in vegas:D",

Been back quite a few time to get the egg noodle and shrimp wonton stoup which Toni T claims the closest thing to traditional tasting. Would i agree to this statement? I dont know, never been anywhere that has enough reasonable creditably to establish themselves as THE place to get shrimp wontons. Regardless the wontons were stuffed with minced/smashed shrimp thus giving a nice plump shrimpy texture. they didnt cut corners by throwing all those tasty shrimp into a food processor till it was just a mush. The soup wasnt bad either and didnt contain that much MSG which is a HUGE plus  If you're not in the mood for soup, and who is these days with summer right around the corner as soon as the weather ponies finish winter warp up (MLP reference!!) then go for the two bbq combo rice plate. I grab bbq pork and roast pork. If you're getting take out then dont expect any soup to come with your order but dining in rates you some soup.   Overall i'd like to stop by more to try other things on the menu as well. Problem is very rarely do i get cravings for Chinese food. I actually crave Mexican more than i do Chinese which is just down right..weird...  Yelp 100 - 022 of 100",

One bite of the roasted pork and char siu, you'll know exactly why I drive across town just to have a meal or two here.    Quality of the food has been maintained throughout the years, service is exactly the same as it was before and typical of any Chinese establishment.  Food, once ordered, arrived to the table swiftly and fresh.  The egg noodles are a must, especially Lo Mien style.    Dishes I order each time I visit:  - Egg noodles with beef stew lo mien style - Won Ton soup  - 3 Meat Combo platter with roasted pork, char siu and the roasted duck  - Curry tendon  My other favorite is their look funn rolls but if I'm eating by myself, usually I cannot eat all of the food I order so I save this dish with a larger group.    My favorite thing about this restaurant is the consistency of their quality.  Thank you for always being there to satisfy my cravings.  The only downside is that they are closed on Fridays.  =(",

We usually come here for their roasted crispy pork belly, duck and their wonton noodles. My husband doesn't eat much Asian food, but he loves the roasted crispy pork belly at first bite.   Sometimes, I want to be healthy but still want to indulge my belly, so I only want a quarter pound but they only sell it to you for at least half a pound. Also, prepare cash! That's why we can still enjoy their low prices.   Service is just okay here, but who cares, as long as they give you tasty food. Small space, ehhh service, good food are reasons why we always order to go. Their roasted pork stays crispy after a 15-20 minute drive.

It reminds me a lot of the restaurants in Guangzhou. This place is awesome. It's so good. It places the wall in the hole for this hole in the wall find. Don't worry the service is friendly and nice. I have not had any bad food here yet after years. My only gripe was that they are closed on Fridays.  After a day's volunteer work, can here to grab a bite. Ordered the dry chow fun with beef, and seafood chow mein, along with an appetizer of piggy ears. In case you are wondering, chow fun are flat noodles, and mein are round noodles. All 3 items came out to be $25 total. Great food and great price. You should check it out if you are in the hood. It's a small little cafe size restaurant.",

And this place fits my definition.  Menu on the wall. Cash only.  - very good food. Awesome BBQ duck, wonton noodle with shrimp dumpling.  Definitely among the better BBQ meats I have had  - full of people speaking Cantonese.  And the people around me were raving about the food or business  - very fast service.  - inexpensive for the type of food.   Can't think of a con other than cash only but then again this place is pretty inexpensive.",

Wonton has meat and shrimps. The noodles are perfectly cooked. Not too soft and not hard.  2. We always get the meat combo. Which includes three choices of meat. Duck, pork belly, xa xui, or chicken hainam with ginger. Al these meat is a must to try! Do not skip it.  3. Friend rice is also good. Plate is very big it can feed up to three people.  4. Crunchy or soft chowmein I a good option if you decided to order this dish. It is covered in vegetables and meat. I have to say the sauce is kind of salty so you can ask it little or on the side  5. Fish balls dipped in curry sauce. The curry sauce has a little spicy kick to it. So if you don't like spicy or curry, just eat the fish ball by itself. It'll still be good.  6. Chinese donuts are fresh everyday. Big and fluffy. We usually eat with our wonton soup. Sup it like bread.  Finally, service. Service is very welcoming here. Although there are some language barrier, their menus are filled with pictures and you can just point.:)   Enjoy!",

We got there at 5 pm on a Saturday and there were a few open tables. By 5:30 there was already a line which grew longer and longer as the night wore on.   Food was great and at a great price, especially for the area. Every dish we got was good enough to get again which included pork belly, BBQ pork, Hainan/Ginger chicken, porridge with pig blood, spicy pig ear spiced to order, picked radishes, and Chinese broccoli. The shining stars?  - Pork Belly: first thing to go, meat was super juicy and skin nice and crisp  - BBQ Pork: also super juicy and great penetration of flavor The porridges all come from the same congee base with the additions added depending on what you order. Still very savory and glad we were able to get the pig blood (our waitress says they generally run out bk it's so popular).   Service was pretty good overall aside from one minor mishap - one of the servers accidently gave us a dish for a different table. We started eating it thinking it was ours (I mean who can resist a plate of crispy juicy pork belly? My mouth is watering just thinking about it...). Wasn't until our actual combo dish came that we realized the mistake and informed the waitresses. Oops. The other table got their dish a few minutes after that but did have to wait a while for it. Other than that, everyone there was super friendly and responsive, albeit very busy.",

I wanted the 3-choice combo so I could get char siu but that would have been too much food for me so I went with the 2-choice combo platter. The roast pork skin was thin and crisp; the pork had an even amount of fat to lean ratio so it wasn't dry. The roast duck was well seasoned and also tasty but I preferred the roast pork more. I didn't see the pea shoots on the menu but when I asked the waiter in Chinese, he mentioned pea shoots was a vegetable option so I was sold. I was visiting from Honolulu, HI and back at home, we don't sell pea shoots at the market or in the restaurants.  This place is cash only. Their prices are reasonable and they give a decent portion. We came for an early dinner (before 5pm) so it wasn't busy. We noticed a lot of local Chinese eating here and I think they are regulars since they ordered immediately after being seated. The service the good and the staff are efficient. We were in and out in about 1 hour. I'm keeping this place on my food list for the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I preferred the bbq pork a bit over the roast duck, just because there was more meat, however, both are really solid choices. The proteins here are on the saltier side, so I'd highly suggest getting it with a side of rice or noodles.  My s/o got the hainan chicken and said it was just ok - I'd probably skip this dish and stick to the bbq meats.  I also ordered a wonton noodle soup since it seemed super highly recommended. The noodles were cooked perfectly - they were al dente and had a nice bite and chew! The soup, on the other hand, had a really fishy flavor which I'm personally not a fan of. The wontons were also just ok.  Overall, this is a great place to get your asian food fix if you're in Vegas and want to go off strip.",

Brisket, curry fish ball with rice noodle. Briskets are soft, fish balls has that nice chew. The noodles are perfectly cooked, not too soft and not too hard, kinda like a chinese version of al dente. Mix that with a little chili oil and let me know what you think  I haven't tried other dishes so I cant give an honest review. Other people seem to enjoy rice dishes and fried noodles.  Perhaps I'll give that a go next time",

Bbq duck wasn't great, lots of fat left on it and flavor was mild, skin was kind of chewy. Very standard Hong Kong food. Servers speaking canto and mandarin if you'd like. Fairly busy place but very quick service. Tables and chairs are hole in the wall level and very simplistic, very close together and not a bunch of space. Would come back here again for the right occasion (my dad coming into town) or if you want the best wonton noodle soup in Las Vegas.",

I opted the pho ap chao xao bo to share with my sister since I wasn't really hungry and felt like it was too hot to have soup that day. The dish I got was really good. Add some sirarcha or pepper for spice and it just makes the whole dish that much better! It's affordable and real good! My mom is a pretty picky eater, never finds any place good but complimented this place! We will be back next time, for sure!!",

    "text": "This place is a hit and miss in many ways. Most importantly, they're one of the only places that take nothing but cash. Keep that in mind before coming!  The setup is very traditional for a Chinese restaurant, meaning: the staff is extremely rude (even if you speak the native language lol), the decor is atrocious (what is with the clashing green walls and the stuff hung up everywhere, right?), and it's busy and it's noisy. But if you get past that cultural part that's going to be constantly prevalent in nearly every authentic Chinese restaurant you go to, the food is typically good.   I say \"typically\" because for the most part, the cooking is consistent. But like many other Chinese restaurants, there isn't really a set recipe, and how good your food is going to be is going to be dependent on who is cooking that day and how they chose to make your food that day.  For example, I've always found the fried duck to be pretty solid here. However, they've lately been skimping on how much actual duck meat they give you, and if you order something like a half duck, you might get parts of the duck that have little meat or are mostly skin and fat when they should be giving you a specific part of it that is usually served. Same thing goes for any soup dishes: sometimes the broth is tasteless, sometimes it's extremely salty, sometimes it's just right. There is unfortunately not much consistency here.",

I have eaten a lot of chk and duck in my life and definitely one of the best I ever had. I might even have to admit that was the most tender duck I've ever had! They also gave us a few different sauces to eat with our BBQ combo. I will definitely be a returning customer.   Oh and they only accept cash here so bring cash!!

We definitely enjoyed the duck over the chicken; probably could have gotten away withOUT the phoenix claws as it was \"meh\". Service was decent; we spoke in Chinese (not sure if it would make a difference...). Small place; expect a small wait for a table and for food. We walked away rubbing our belly.

The menu has many choices to choose from beside bbq and you can also have noodles plus different rice dishes. I tried the roast pork and roast duck combination. They weren't as flavorful as others I have tried at other places, but they were still good none the less. The pork had the nice crispy skin and the duck was moist. They also provide a small dipping sauce for each item which to me was a big plus especially the plum sauce for the duck.  The second time we went I tried the beef chow fun which was good with a nice wok flavor and the serving size was large. The only thing was that it seemed a bit dry and could've used a bit more oil when cooked. Also I needed to add some soy sauce as it wasn't too salty enough.  The place is kind of small considering how busy this restaurant can get, but they do pretty quick service as they try to get people in and out without much of a wait. Good to try some Chinese bbq in LV for the first time and a place I wouldn't mind coming again on another trip.",

Parking isn't the best here. Hint: there's a huge parking lot across the street. This is a Hong Kong style BBQ hole-in-the-wall restaurant that provides wonderful Hong Kong classics. I emphasize that this is not the place for a first date. Take-out service looked very efficient here. I recommend the roast pork and roast duck. The ginger chicken that was served to me had a lot of bones and fat but not enough meat. I recommend going elsewhere for ginger chicken. The BBQ pork was good, but I prefer it without the intense star anise taste. Overall, after visiting this modest establishment, I realized how much the Asian food scene has modernized. Trendy Asian desserts, hip ramen joints, and the Korean BBQ wave outshine restaurants like Asian BBQ & Noodle. However, if you desire to appreciate authentic Hong Kong cuisine, Asian BBQ & Noodle represents tradition masterfully.",

For the adventurous eaters, there are pork intestines, blood, ears (the spicy version served thinly sliced is yummy),  roasted duck, and roasted pork (skin so crispy it crunches). If not so adventurous, there is shrimp dumplings, tofu, meatballs, and mushrooms that you can add to your noodle bowl.  Beware, it's a cash only restaurant so no credit cards.",

I'm not a fan of duck (I know. Shame on me.), so I just doubled on the pork belly. F.U.C. it right?! You only live once, and consuming that much pork belly that might have been the last of my living days!  The pork belly was delish! The meat fat was so juicy and so tender. All most melt in your mouth tender, and the skin was extra crispy! The portions are very big portions. They offer two full strips per order with the combo so I ended up with 4. Don't worry I didn't eat all 4! The dipping sauce goes great with the pork belly. I'd really love to go back to try the rest of their food.  I also noticed that they have a wide variety on their menu! They even have a make it yourself noodle bowl with all the options for meat and vegetables as well as your choice of noodle. I would also suggest to try their lemon iced tea with your meal. Their iced tea here is so refreshing and very lemony!!!! It's more lemony tasting than than tea tasting.",

We ordered combo plates with  2 BBQ and one with ginger chicken as well as a side order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Everything we ordered was precooked and came off a steam table affair. Buffet food served at your table! Something must have been wrong with the heat because everything was cold except for the bowls of corn water (it certainly wasn't soup!), that was McDonalds coffee hot. I know ginger chicken is served cold but I prefer mine closer to room temperature than refrigerator cold. Both the chicken and roast duck had so little meat on them. I cook poultry a lot and recognized both portions as coming from the poultry backs which are the least meaty parts. The oyster sauce on the cold broccoli was so salty and plentiful I had to scrape most of it off. Recommend it to friends or visitors, a resounding NO!",

The BBQ food is good here and not too salty.  We ordered a combo with two choices of BBQ items.  We got the duck and pork which both tasted really good.  They were surprisingly not fatty as other places I have been near my hometown of Seattle.  We had a seat next to the glass window of BBQ and the duck was sold out at one point.  We ordered wonton mein and beef chow fun in addition to the BBQ.  These items were nothing to write about but the service we received was great.

After a few days of buffets, western bbq and seafood, I crave a rice bowl, and this place is a really good place for it.  As soon as you step in, the staff smile and ask what they can do for you, even at noon.  And the place is full of Chinese people, which is important if you are searching for authentic.  It was packed, so I ordered takeout - white rice with bbq pork belly and duck.  Huge amounts of white rice and the meats, and a couple of sticks of gai lan.  Their duck soy sauce was also very tasty without MSG.  Trust me - I am supersensitive to MSG.  $8, and I could only finish half the rice.  It was filling and really good food.    It's in the same mall as Cravin' Cajun, just three doors away, so parking is plentiful.  Definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

For $6.99 I got  a huge plate of Roasted Duck, Pork Belly and Rice. Everything was succulent. The Pork Belly skin had just the right amount of crispiness and not too much fat.

Other items that are delicious are the roast pork with super crispy crunchy skin and the spicy pig ear side order.

The food here mostly sells Cantonese \"street food\" so we ordered:  Curry Noodle with Pig Feet: This is my favorite dish here. We originally wanted fish ball instead of pig feet but they ran out. I love the broth. The broth isn't a strong curry like thick Indian curries but it was really flavorful. The pig feet was really tender too. They give about 6 pieces and a few vegetables.  Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce: It seemed that they overcooked the broccoli because the stem of the broccoli was soft and the leafy part was soft to almost gooey consistency. So I didn't care for this dish much. The sauce was good and not too salty.  BBQ Pork: Because a lot of people come in here for their bbq items (ex. duck, pork, etc.), they sell them so quickly that they didn't cook it long enough. But I noticed that people taking food to go order it, so they must cook it long enough on occasion. Maybe we just got a bad batch.   Meatball Egg Noodle Soup: The meatball is pretty good. It was soft. The egg noodle is pretty good too. It was really thin.   Service was ok. They don't have a lot of workers here but the food came out quick.  The restaurant is sooo small. The distance between tables are quite close. They also have a hard time with large groups that are more than 4 people because they have to combine tables for large groups.   Overall, all the dishes here are less than $10. Restaurant is small and food is good. I'll definitely come back here again.",

Chinese broccoli had a little too much oyster sauce on it.  Went on a Monday night at 6:45pm and barely got in without waiting - though in all fairness, the rapid turnaround in tables did not result in anyone waiting more than 15 minutes that night.    However, it is a mad house and people don't dawdle when eating there. If you want to eat at your leisure - go take out.  Will definitely be coming back.",

The roast duck is absolutely delicious and juicy. It's made just right.  Same goes for the roast pork too. The crunch of the skin on the pork is just perfection.   The beef chow fun is great as well!   This place gets packed really quickly, so I suggest you go before noon.  You can always order to go as well.",

    "text": "I came here the first time with friends. It was crowded.   The place:  small and not comfortable. The table is small. We ordered four dishes for 4 people and there was not enough room on the table. I would not bring my date here to this little place.  Food: this is basically a BBQ noddle place, nothing fancy. If you are looking for BBQ and noodle place, you are in the right place. BBQ items are not bad but not much better than the other places. Ordered Chow Mein. They used the thick noodles and they were fried and not pan fried to save time.   Price: It is expensive. They are basically serving dinner menu all day. They don't have a lunch menu. Chow fun and average $12, probably the most expensive in town for a little place during lunch time. You can go to most Chinese restaurant to order chow fun on the dinner menu and they are around $9-10 max. It is more expensive than Ping Peng Pong in the Gold cost Casino. The portion is dinner portion. If you walk across the street to Hong Kong Garden (3407 S. Jones), the same dish on their lunch menu is only $5.99, exactly half and the quality is about the same, Their dinner price is only $8.99, much cheaper for comparable items. For lunch, I may not want to spend $12 for a Chow Fun dish in this place.   Service: It is OK because my friend is a regular customer here and he tips good.  Overall, this place has quality food, but not really better than other restaurants in town. The place is small and seating is not comfortable. The worst part is the price. It is expensive compared to most of the oter other restaurant for whatever limited items they are serving. This place is overrated IMO.   I would not return unless someone else is inviting me. I live in town and I have tried most of the Cantonese restaurants. There are better place with much better dinning environment and much cheaper with comparable quality food. Don't bring you date here. He or she may like the food but not the place.",

Great flavor on the pork and roasted to perfection.  Mi Xau Don (Crispy Noodle):  The flavor was good but there was too much sauce/gravy that made the noodles too soggy to fast.  If they lighten up on the sauce, the dish would be perfect.",

It cooks the noodles, so you have to wait about 2-3 mins. to dig into those. In the mean time you can sip broth and eat the delicious wonton (pork) wontons. It's the bomb if you know/like Chinese soup. They also add scallions and a few chinese greens.  I've tried their roasted pork. I did not think it was the bomb like other reviewers. It's ok. I think I just have spent my childhood eating roasted pork (lechon). So, if eating pork , I guess I prefer that (and wontons, and bacon of course).",

    "text": "I can never review enough or keep talking about me some Roast Pork Action!! I had friends visiting from back home thinking about checking out Asian BBQ & Noodles. Hell yay great idea! I have been meaning too go back too try more of the menu. Now three of us that more food can try. We ordered the chicken chow fun with black bean sauce. It was solid dish. I associate the black bean sauce too anything seafood or specifically clams with black bean in chinese restaurants almost fool proof. I enjoyed fact that had right balance not too much bean but nice hint along with chicken, vegetables, and prefect noodles. Delicious! We order the shrimp fried rice that was good. I think still would take the beef fried rice had the last time. COURSE since three pf us  got full lb of without doubt best roasted pork in Vegas. If read reviews reason why people come here for the roast pork. The only thing that little bit of let down had the roasted duck won ton soup. The roasted duck main reason ordered it plus never had soup here so figure get the best of both worlds. In this case not so much because being in soup lose the whole crispy duck skin. I could imagine just duck would be winnah although still lose out too the Roasted Pork. The noodles in the soup was just bland no flavor, the broth would say the same, the won ton was ok, and if order the roasted duck would taking it over rice then soup. Just me. I enjoyed Asian BBQ & Noodles it small place but has so much personality. When you go too restaurant that only takes cash helps keep from racking up the credit card debt. Lol!!!",

I thought the pork was okay and the duck was actually tastier. I came on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, but we were seated immediately when we came in. Most of the items are under $10, which is a deal in my book. Maybe this place was a little too authentic for me because most of the dishes had a home-made flare rather than the typical Chinese restaurant. One thing I do applaud them for is the service, the service was greeat! We were treated like human beings, which not very common at Chinese restaurants. Most of the time as a customer you feel like the server/owner is doing you a favor by serving you, but totally not the case here. If you're a big duck fan definitely come here. I'll probably swing by again just to try the soup because it looks pretty tasty on the Yelp pictures.",

Could it look any tastier?  Every time I see it (or think it), I envision how good it must taste and have come close so many times to ordering it.  I know, you're wondering \"well why on earth didn't you?\"   The answer is not an easy one.  Some combination of a lack of an official website/menu which can turn me off of a place a little, along with being tied to lunch partners who wouldn't have a desire to visit, along with some unknown fear that resided with me in trying it.   Well today I strapped on a \"No Fear\" t-shirt from 1995 (not really) and called in an order to make my dreams come True.  It was not easy.  I venture to say it was one of the more difficult phone ordering processes I've ever experienced.  It took a few minutes for me to convey I wanted the Roast Pork and Roast Duck combo over rice and an iced tea to go.  In fact, during the drive there I was certain it wouldn't be what I wanted, that my dreams would be crushed over a simple game of telephone.  When I showed up the entire restaurant was packed, and it made the telephone conversation difficulty a little more clear to me.  Seeing the \"Cash Only\" sign only amplified my fear that my order was wrong and that they would try to charge me for a full roast duck and pig and a side of rice, in which I would need to work off by washing dishes in the back for the rest of the afternoon.   To my pleasant surprise, once the cashier had a free second she rang me up and I was charged $6.99 (before tax) just as the photo told me.  After what seemed like an argument I was given my iced tea and on my way.  Back at the office I hurriedly opened my lunch to see what I had coveted all these months right in front of me.  No napkins or fork were provided (just a spoon(?) and some chopsticks (I know, those should suffice), but at this point I didn't care, all I needed was my mouth and my combo.   I was not opposed to shoveling it in with my bare hands if needed.  I procured my own fork and napkins and dug in.   It would almost be impossible to live up to my expectations, but it came very close.  The duck was tender and delicious, and the pork was very tasty but I found it to not be as moist as I expected.  The 10 lbs of rice and handful of pieces of Chinese broccoli were a good accompaniment.  I was tempted to go 5 stars as dream fulfillment ranks very high on my list of pluses for a business, but the service could have been a little friendlier and the pork a little more moist for it to be the perfect experience.",

The pork had a nice crackle to the skin, slim on the grease and meaty flavor.  I ordered curried squid and vermicelli noodles (bun) in a hot soup.  The squid was on a skewer and dipped into curry sauce.  The noodles were slightly chewy and plentiful.  It wasn't how I imagined being served yet still tasty.  The squid was a little overlooked but not rubbery.  It could have been from sitting near the hot soup.   Nothing fancy nor romantic about this place, just plain good food.

The roast pork was super tender and its skin super crispy... Imagine a delicious piece of meat practically melting in your mouth and then bite down for a satisfying crunch from the skin. The duck's seasoning was unique - I had never had any duck as peppery as that, but it was a nice change of flavor.  They have other noodle dishes and their wonton soups are pretty good, but I would definitely recommend their BBQ. It does seem to be high in demand, and they ran out of roast pork when were were leaving, around 7 PM, so go early! (But not too early, as it seemed like their BBQ doesn't come out until around 5 PM). The ladies working are friendly, but probably more so if you speak Chinese.",

That's probably why we were after thought in our server's mind.  It's worth a trip back, to get the duck and see if we agree with so many others, that it's in the top 100!

I was excited because I have been looking all over Las Vegas for some good BBQ pork and when I arrive the line was out the door!   When I walked in I knew exactly what I wanted to order! 1 pound of BBQ pork to go! We were making our own soup at home and just needed the meat to top it off.  Anyways I waited in what I thought was a line to place my order, but everyone ignores me!!! Then I asked the lady at the counter who would take my order and she looked away!!! So I stopped someone else in the place and said who can take my order to go? They pointed in the direction of a woman walking around helping ALL of the people who were behind me in our line.  Finally after about 5 min she approached me took my order and them gave me a number. Yay!!!  Then it goes downhill... I waited for 25 minutes.... In front of register with my 4 year old who they kept telling to move. And all of a sudden the lady who took my order comes up and says... We are out of the BBQ pork!!!! You can wait 30 more minutes but the regular customer got it!!!!!  Omg! I was livid!!!!  Was really excited! Wanted to give it a shot, but on too of the customer service towards me being horrible I didn't even get to taste the food!   BETTER LUCK TO SOMEONE ELSE!",

GIven that the primary headliners here (BBQ and Noodles) aren't my routine diet, it has taken me quite some time to venture here. However, I am glad that I did because it's a little Vegas gem.   As long as you are not sensitive to neon green and yellow walls, the interior is downright cozy and definitely clean. It feels like a True Chinatown immersion. If you don't speak Chinese or aren't familiar with the offerings, ordering might be a tad intimidating, but we had a super friendly waitress who tried her best to decipher what we wanted. She did a good job, except for the noodle dish. Somehow we ended up with a pile of plain, albeit very long, noodles and a pair of scissors.    The real star here is the pork with its perfect combination of buttery, succulent fat and magically crispy rind. You order this meat candy by the pound. We also ordered the soy sauce chicken, and I confess, the skin creeps me out, but the flavor was delicious. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. Nothing we tasted had the heavy five spice flavor, which is something I generally do not like.   After a minor communication breakdown, we managed to order ong choy stir fried with garlic. It was rather greasy, but I couldn't stop eating it! The menu only lists vegetables with oyster sauce, so I am not sure how you unlock this vegetable version. After trying to explain what we wanted, our waitress came by with a plate of vegetables she was taking to another table, and we said, \"Yes, that!\"  It was too hot for soups that day, but I definitely want to make it back to try their wonton.   If you're a lover of all things Asian, this is a must-try for sure.",

So if you're one of those people who counts calories, hates greasy food and what not, then... you might just want to stick to Panda Express =P  Coming from a predominantly Asian community, my standards for Chinese food are pretty high. A couple of my classmates and I came here on a whim in search of good duck and crispy pork. We didn't order anything else on the menu, so I can't vouch for any other items. However, the pork & duck rice plate with yu choy (a Chinese vegetable) is pretty wonderful, especially at $6.95 a plate. It comes with two sauces to dip the meat in. And of course, the duck and pork skins are crispy and tasty. Quite the bargain :)",

After reading several yelp reviews on this place, I decided to try the Wonton soup (4.99) and the two meat combo plate with steamed rice (6.99). The lady at the counter must have known it was my first time there, because she practically grabbed my hand and walked me over to the hanging pork and duck. The roasted duck was a little fatty for my liking, but the BBQ pork was amazing.   The pork was super tender and had a sweet flavor. I recommend adding a little chili oil to the pork!  The combo plate came with about 10 slices of each protein , steamed rice and greens. At first I thought they were  green onions, so I put them off the side. Upon further review, I added them back to my plate and was glad I did.   Unfortunately, I didn't agree with previous yelp reviews on the Wonton soup. The broth reminded me of miso soup and seemed to have a fish stock base to it. The Wontons themselves contained shrimp -which I did not expect. Since I am not a huge fan of shrimp, I can't confirm that this is the best version of Wonton soup in Las Vegas (as other have claimed).   The restaurant is clean, and well organized. There is a large menu on the wall behind the cash register that makes it easy to order. My food was ready in less than 10 minutes, and was still piping hot when I got back to work. I love this place, and can't wait to come back.",

The BBQ Chicken and Duck is pretty good, not too much meat in it. I felt like there is more bones than the meat. But the BBQ roast belly pork is excellent, crunchy on the skin, juicy in the middle part, nice and tender on the meat. Perfect balance. I think it's my favorite, will always have to order that everytime I come.   3 stars for most of the food, 5 stars for the BBQ roast pork, 5 stars for the price minus 0.5 star for not accepting credit card..

We went there on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't even that busy, in fact I had the largest party (of 7) when I arrived. The server automatically brought out waters but took a couple of minutes for the menu to get to me after he was ready to take my order and realized I didn't have one.   I ordered the whole duck which came to my table room temperature, it wasn't even hot to enjoy that parts of the duck that contained a high portion of fat was too fatty to bite into.  The Shrimp & Combination Fried Rice wasn't too bad but wasn't the best either. The ratio of noodle to veggies/seafood for their pan fried noodle wasn't well proportioned (lacked so much noodles) and finally when I ordered the pigs ear in soy sauce & the spicy chicken feet, it would've been nice to be told that these were cold appetizers.   My server was too busy catering to the other customers who were Chinese unlike me & my party who were not. Even to get a water refill was almost impossible. I can guarantee you that this is definitely the first & LAST time I'll be ever eating here & I work for the hotel industry so I can assure you that I will spread the word to my friends that this place is by far a horrible choice to make! If I could rate it with negative stars, trust me, I would have!!  I was so disappointed because for the first time I went to a high rated establishment that was a total False rated place for me.",

This place can get crowded as its a very small restaurant. When there is a line of peoppe, it can get confusing. They dont really have a number system and when they give you a ticket, they just write down the number of people. So once you get your number, you will need to keep a mental note of who was there before and after you or else yoy may wind up have a MoFo come in and take your spot.  Other than that, the food is fantastic. The porridge taste better than some of the restaurants in the san gabriel valley and the bbq is tastier and softer as well.  Definetly a place to stop by if you crave authentic asian food once you are done gambling.",

Just by myself I ordered 3 items just to try and they were all tasty. The roast duck and wonton soup was full of wontons and duck, and very little noodles, most other places it's the opposite. The steam chicken and ginger/scallion sauce was top-notch, chicken is fresh, you can tell by the chewy skin texture, kinda like a baking hen. Wife had a soup with curry fish ball, must say we had never tried this, so wasn't expecting too much, I came away loving it, wifey so-so, but then she's Caucasian and grew up on meats and potatoes, roast pork was flavorful and skin was crispy like it should be...so much to eat and best of all you can't beat the pricing.",

    "text": "I love this place! This place has one of the most authentic hong kong style cuisines in terms of the noodles. It is one of the secrets of Chinatown area until recently when more and more people are coming. It has been voted 8th in the top 100 Chinese foods list. My family comes here all the time due to its authenticity in terms of taste and cost. First, the cost for the food is cheap compared to other places and there is a variety of things to try from roasted duck, roasted pork, to noodles, to various toppings to add onto your noodle. And they are closed one day of the week, I think it was Fridays that was written. Second, the food comes really fast after ordering. This place is always crowded around lunch time and you will have to wait if there are no seats. The place is pretty small compared to many other restaurants in terms of space and seating. Third, the food is always flavorful. Though I had a couple times where the topping I wanted \"Pork Blood\" was sold out. All the toppings are always cooked really well. The main thing to try at this place is the noodles + toppings. You have a choice between the type of noodle you want. I usually chose udon due to my taste for a more chewier noodle. And then you can choose whether you want one, two, or three toppings to add into the soup/noodle. The toppings range from pork blood, pork belly, curry fish balls, fish balls, tofu, and etc. Also, there is a lot of different mixes that they are willing to accommodate if you ask. For instance, you can order a won ton soup and still add in different toppings if you wanted to.  However, if your taste buds are not so interested in the toppings you can add into your noodle, there is always duck and chicken to try. It is always fresh and flavorful. The butcher always cuts the meat really clean so when you get the product, you don't have to go trying to pull the pieces apart. In addition, he is very delicate with the food (which also means patience) if you are looking to do take-out. But the duck and chicken are a lot better than other Chinese places I've eaten at.  Very important: This place is CASH only.",

Challenge accepted. Definitely off the beaten path for us, as we found it nestled in a corner of a strip mall. They ordered the pork while I got the roast duck. Awesome for the price and portion of the food. Have you ever had bbq pork with the skin on it? Not only that, but it's cooked to a crisp, like a pork rind? Oh my blob, it's good! The roast duck was very tasty, and they even topped off the rice included in the place with its sauce. Worth the visit, and worth coming back to.",

If you order on the phone, do yourself a favor and don't show up until 45 minutes later. You don't want to wait for your food in there, trust me. Small space, packed, and everyone walking back and forth. When you get to the cashier, be aggressive in letting them know which order you're there for, or else you will be ignored or someone else will jump right in front of you. That's just how it goes. Even though all this is a hassle, the food is so legit, 5 Stars. Been coming here for years.  FYI: CASH ONLY",

I'm definitely a big fan of their noodle soup, especially their  combination noodles, as you get to choose the type of noodles and the type of meat/ veggies (pig intestines, pig tongue, pig feet, etc.).  Also love their BBQ items, their crispy pork and roasted duck are to die for!   Service was also good.  Food came out quickly, water was always full (without asking)!

If you are planning to bring your date here for a romantic experience then you are in the wrong side of neighborhood. Some must try items are their crackling BBQ pork and roasted duck.",

    "text": "This used to be my very favorite restaurant. Unfortunately, the last two times my wife and I were there, seemingly things have changed.   Three days ago, my wife and I went in for our regular weekly visit.  As usual we ordered fish balls in curry sauce, marinated duck wings, char siu and roast duck, a dumpling soup and a beef with pan fried noodle.   It was at 12.30 pm and the place was jammed pack. We were seated in turn. The fish balls and the duck wings were per as usual, tasty and well done. Then came the char siu and roast duck which were simply awful. The duck pieces were full of fat and little meat. The char siu was tasteless. Our dumpling soup came and it was OK.   However, we waited for another 30 minutes for the fried noodle. When we asked the waitress to speed it up, we were told that the kitchen was very busy. I then noticed that nothing came out of the kitchen for a long time. All the other dishes, fish balls, duck wings and etc were all from the front counter.   What really irritated us was there were three tables that ordered later than we did, and their kitchen foods came out sooner than ours. When I expressed this to the waitresses, all they can say was Sorry. It took another five to ten minutes after the tables ahead of us had their food before we received our noodle dish.   What really ticked us off was that the fried noodle dish was simply awful, The noodle wasn't pan fried, feels like somewhat deep fried and very oily.  The sauce is minimal and the beef and veggies in the dish were not cooked properly and tasted terrible.  Ever since this restaurant has opened up another one on Spring Mountain, I noticed that the quality has slowly gone down hill. Have they moved one or two cooks to the new place?? Or is the new restaurant losing too much money and this place has to slim down to help out monetarily?? In  the old days, the owner(s) are always visible in the restaurant managing the place. Now it seems like the owners are not there, they may be at the new place, and hence when the cat is away, the mice play.   My wife and I have refused to patron their new restaurants as each dish is about 30 to 40% more expensive and the food is not as good as this place.   This place is such a money making place and if the owners choose to forsake this place and let it run down, it would be a terrible loss, for them as well as for their followers.  We will wait a few weeks and return for another visit. If it is still as bad as our most recent visit, I will simply write off this place and wont visit them again.",

It's located in the same plaza as Snow White, a Mongolian hot pot place, District One and a few other popular restaurants.   The restaurant is pretty small and a server was talking to the cashier when I walked in. The cashier did not even look at me and continued to look through some papers. When I told her I wanted to order to go she waved over to a server to take my order. I noticed that prices have gone up about $2-3 for the combo plates. I ordered the 2 item combo ($13.99) and I chose the pork belly and duck as well as wonton soup. The total came out to be $22.69. CASH ONLY!!!   My order came out fairly quickly. There were 7 wontons in my soup which were good, but I felt that it was overpriced. The broth wasn't anything special, it seemed like regular chicken broth to me. I would recommend the wonton noodle soup over the wonton soup, I think they're the same price.  I was very disappointed in the pork belly. The portion I received was very salty. The duck was well seasoned but super fatty. I think I'll order only duck next time.",

Bring your Jackson bills because plastic is unacceptable and you'll be washing dishes to settle your bill otherwise. Waitresses here aren't out of your way friendly but cordial and get the requests filled when made - pretty typical of most Asian establishments.

I've had this place book marked for years and never went until tonight. There's a million run of the mill places but only a handful of gems.  This place is like a production line in the best way possible. Quick, polite, fresh, affordable, and satisfying. Come here for Chinese BBQ duck, pork, and pork belly. Served over rice, with noodles, or in soup. They do have a bunch of soups, pan fried noodles, and noodle soups. There are banners claiming it's the eight top Chinese restaurant in the entire USA- kind of cool!  I ordered the two meat combo served with white rice, shared an order of duck, and shared an order of crispy pan fried beef noodles with gravy. Everything was delicious. I particularly liked the bbq pork. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The pork belly was also really good with the dark dipping sauce. The white rice had a splash of meat drippings on it and really made the plate of food special. They served a complimentary soup that I liked. It was a nice start to the fatty dishes. The pan fried noodles were okay- kind of small portion of protein.  The BBQ'd meats were really good and each stood out in their own way. I was initially put off by the staff's lack of urgency with getting our order as opposed to diners who sat after us. There was a gentleman who sat after us, got soup, and got his entree before we even got water or placed an order. I'm glad the lady who came up to us did when she did because she was very sweet and helped us decide what to order. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt this time..  It ended up being a solid four as the food and sweet lady out weighed the bad. I really liked my dinner. I can't wait to go back and kind of fell in love with the hustle and bustle of this little BBQ joint.",

Everyone in my family agreed this was one of the best BBQ/Noodle house there is.  It rivals the best in San Francisco China Town !  We ordered: Wonton egg-noodle soup ($4.99), wide-strand egg-noodle (dry with soup in a separate bowl), porridge, bbq pork dish, roasted duck dish, roasted pork.  They all were delicious and hit the mark right on.  The noodle bowls and porridge are steaming hot as they come to the table.  The place was clean and efficient, very busy during lunch hours.  The restaurant closes on Fridays (that tells you how well the business is doing that they would choose to close on one of the busiest days of the week).  The waiter who waited on us was super helpful and friendly - a rarity in a Chinese establishment like this.  It was so good that we had to return the next morning for another yummy meal before hitting the road.  btw, we also ordered quite a bit of bbq and roasts to take home.  This is definitely a \"Don't Miss\" noodle house.  I hope it will continue to deliver such great taste in the years to come.",

YUM. will always come back everytime i crave for chinese soup, a good break from the usual japanese ramen. :) only thing i have to remember is to bring cash since they don't take credit cards.",

Came here with Grandpa, so I decided it would be a great time to try a BBQ combination platter! We chose the Roasted Pork Belly, Roasted Duck, and BBQ Pork. Pork Belly was good, tender and flavorful with a very crispy skin. The Roast Duck was outstanding! Very juicy, flavorful and not gamey at all. The BBQ Pork was the highlight for me...great smokey BBQ taste, beautiful smoke rings and lots and lots of flavor! I'd say the Roasted Duck and the BBQ Pork are the best I've ran into so far!  Also tried the Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce. Good stuff! Came out piping hot, fresh, and yummy...good distraction from all the meat and rice   This was too much food for two people! And the prices are very reasonable, with rice bowls starting at $6.50 with choice of BBQ meat!  All of this cost less than a $20 bill for two people.  Just remember, cash only!  I love finding new places I can get excited about...a very worthy #300 in my book!",

So, I entered the place about 20 minutes after opening (10 am) and there were about 12 people already eating so I knew this place was going to be good if this was there choice of breakfast.  The place was CLEAN with great Chinese BBQ smells flowing through the air.  There were about 5 waiters waiting around to take your order when ready.  So, I ordered 1/2 of The Roast Duck, # of The BBQ Pork, and # of The Roast Pork. Everything was great with flavors n crunch and not greasy or fatty in anyway.  This hidden gem is Worth the drive from anywhere if you want the best of the best in pork and now my favorite duck (not a duck fan at all but this won my taste buds over).  They have a whole lot of other dishes that I will be back to try and I will be back! For More.",

Mutterings of indifference. A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.  Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims \"why couldn't we eat that\", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.  The waitress answers for us \"You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish\".    To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pureed innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.  Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.  Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.  Good eats for sure.",

What impressed me is they serve real Chow Mein, not Lo Mein, and call it chow mein. I strongly reccomend the BBQ Pork Chow Mein. I prefer the \"crispy noodle\" choice, but others tell me the soft noodles are also very good.   Great combos, and lots of choices if you like to eat duck. They skip the \"gringo\" Americanized Chinese dishes like Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Whatever.  Just real authentic Chinese food dishes.   So, if you are into really good tasting, authentic Chinese food, and don't care about the table cloth, vest outfitted waiters, and the always positive fortune cookies, this is the place to go.  Also, it's great quality for take out, for that dinner at home, or house party.",

I decided to  eat on a Friday and there were about 20 people waiting to be seated.  You can put your own name on the list  just inside the door and I waited outside with others.  Several people outside asked if I had eaten there before and they also heard the food was good.  The wait was over 40 minutes and I was given a table against the wall which also served as a storage area for napkins, chopsticks, and condiments.  The place was packed and loud.  I had to complain that no one had taken my order as I observed others that came in after I did, being waited on.  I ordered the duck/BBQ combo plate.  I was told no more BBQ and the server suggested something she thought was good so I had duck/whatever.  I was given my drink and waited for what I thought was longer than I should have waited and I was brought a large  mound of  rice, which was good.  The duck was good but barely warm.  I'm not sure how duck supposed to be served but it was good.  The second item (pork?) was about room temperature and left no memorial impression.  I would not go through what I went through to eat there again.  The restaurant was packed with many Asian people so I have to think that the quality of food must be  what people are coming in for.  This restaurant has seating for about 40 people  but that seems a little to much for comfort.  I gave 3 stars for the experience I have to think 3 stars would be normal.",

They do Chinese BBQ right. Cooked to perfection.  The soup noodle (thin egg noodles) choose your items is really good. Soup base has a light curry flavor. Amazing authentic Chinese flavors. Love the stewed beef. Deep fried fish balls no curry.   Would love to visit whenever In Vegas",

I salivate at the mere thought of that massive plate of sliced roast pork beside cuts of honey glazed bbq pork. The HK style milk tea is excellent--not too sweet with a rich milkiness and bitterness.",

Oh my goodness I ordered the pork combo with the charsiu and the pork belly and it literally melts in your mouth and the pork skin is so crunchy, it's slightly salty which makes it even tastier. And then I ordered a wonton soup without noodles and oh my was that surprisingly delicious! I say these two are the best combo to get! The wonton soup tastes authentic and not like they put a shit ton of MSG in there, the wontons have half shrimp and half meat in there and some Bok Choy but I have to say it is worth it! This place is wonderful for if you want good cheap Chinese food (:",

We were seated and had our order taken. Ten minutes pass and people who were seated after us started to get their food. Our server comes by and asks us to confirm what noodle dish we ordered. We told him and continued to wait, another ten minutes pass by.  A couple who had just been seated got what appeared to be a free bowl of soup and their food quickly. Finally a different server comes by and asks us to confirm what BBQ dish we ordered. We just decided to leave after waiting so long and seeing half the tables empty and people coming in and getting their food within a few minutes.   The food however is good, even though it's gotten more expensive over the past couple years. The roasted pork belly is probably the best in the city and the BBQ pork is solid. The duck is just mediocre though as it isn't very meaty. Overall for Chinese BBQ, I'd rather go across the street to Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe. The service isn't great either but it's never horrible. To get my cheap roast Duck fix, I'd rather go to Foods 2 Go on Decatur & Tropicana at the International Marketplace.",

This place will make you feel like you're not in Vegas. The food made me reminisce that time when I was at the night market in Kowloon! A place I definitely will frequent more often. I tried the BBQ duck with rice and washed it down with a Thai tea. I will recommend both! CLEANEST Asian restaurant I've been to!!! You gotta try it just for that reason!",

When we are craving this place we make it a point to get there as close to opening time as we can to beat the rush and to ensure there is still roasted pork/duck left. Yes...they've run out before.   Parking: There is a good sized lot in the plaza they are located in, however, there is no guarantee that everyone parked politely. Let's just assume the dbag that took up 2 spaces was in some sort of roasted pork emergency.   My family and I usually get the roasted pork and roasted suck egg noodle soup with the meats on the side. That way the crispy crispy pork skin doesn't get soggy from the soup.   This place is worth the wait and enduring the fluorescent green and yellow walls. The layers of crispy pork skin, soft fat, tender juicy meat and flavorful end will make you want seconds. The duck is just as delicious with it's semi-crispy skin and rich meat. YUMMM. Get some to go too.",

We came here because we wanted some Fobbinese food after gorging on burgers/sandwiches for the past couple days. Location-wise, it's off the strip and nestled in the corner of one of the Chinese strip malls in Chinatown where the prices are so much cheaper.   We had:  1. Roast duck and pork belly: Just friggin' delicious. Portion was plenty for all of us with just one plate. The whole plate was packed; although the plate itself was not too big to begin with.   2. Hainan chicken rice: Yummy!! The rice was a little hard (seemed like it had been sitting out for a while), but the chicken was tender, moist, and the whole combination was flavorful.  3. Salted fish and chicken fried rice: huge portion and big on flavor! So goooood!   4. We also ordered sides of fishballs and green broccoli - fresh, cheap, and delicious!   Service was rather slow, even when we came at 11 a.m, but the food is great, cheap and delicious!   I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I will say this place is unfriendly towards non-Chinese speakers who aren't familiar with this style of restaurant. They aren't mean but the menu is too vague and many of the waiters and waitresses speak much English. It is also cash only.  Still, the food is excellent and the prices low. My favorite is the cha siu. I get it either with rice or in soup with noodles.",

If your schedule allows, I suggest showing up fifteen minutes before they open just so you don't have to deal with the crowds. If not, I suggest just getting it to go.   Their crispy pork is literally the best I have ever had. Lemme put that into context for you. I live in Southern California, and my family had made the drive just so we can show other people how good this place is. Their wonton soup and peking duck are good also. I love that I can get chinese broccoli with oyster sauce here (cause usually I'd have to venture to a dim sum place.)   There is really good, authentic Chinese food here and it's definitely worth the trip! If you're ever in the area, go and try it! You won't regret it!",

I am really impressed with the consistency on how the food tastes every time I come here. I highly recommend going here for roasted duck. The jelly fish and pigs ears are also some of the sides that I enjoy from time to time but those are delicacies so it might be weird if you've never had them before.

They're also cash only so remember that before you go.   All dishes are made fresh daily. They throw everything out that isn't eaten at the end of the night.   There's so many yummy dishes here!! We always get the following:   1. Roast Duck: BEST DUCK IN VEGAS!!! They run out of the duck quickly on busy days. The skin is crispy and fatty, the middle is juicy, tender and tasty! It's so good. You can eat it by itself or dip it in the sauce it comes with. You can get a whole duck to take home as well.  2. Pork Belly: I've only had bad pork belly here once. Every other time it was tasty and on point.  3. Combination fried rice: can't go wrong w/ any of the fried rice dishes here.  4. Snow pea leaves vegetable 5. Steamed chicken   Everything is fairly cheap here. You can easily enjoy a hearty meal for $15 or less depending on what you order. Of course, all larger dishes are big enough to share family style.   The service is always good when I go w/ my mom or husband (both speak fluent Vietnamese or Cantonese). However, when it's just me there was a bit of a language barrier so they had a hard time understanding some of the questions I had about the dishes. I recommend reading the menu and naming the numbered item you want. The Food always comes out hot and fresh.   The place gets busy for lunch and dinner. You'll be seated faster w/ a smaller group (2 people). Anything larger may mean you have to wait a bit.   Overall, I love this place! Highly recommend if you want fast, yummy, authentic Chinese food    Happy Dining,   JT",

There's always a crowd here but wait times are never too long.   If you come here, I definitely recommend ordering their bbq items just to try it out. The roast pork has crispy skin, their chicken is very tender, and their duck is fatty, juicy and delicious. Can't really go wrong! If bbq is not your thing, their fried rice and noodles are excellent as well. My favorite is the salted fish and chinese sausage fried rice and the chiu chow rice noodle rolls. The salted fish adds a great salty flavor to the rice but the chinese sausage adds hints of sweetness. The rice roll is pan fried to crispy perfection with great flavor. The noodle comes with pork, shrimp, egg and green onions.   They also have stuff like wonton noodle soup and congee. Next time I go I definitely want to try out their congee!",

This is a great place for a quick bite, not a sit and converse for hours type of space. But the food is delicious and flavorful, I recommend the roast duck with rice and wonton soup. This combination is a Chinese person's comfort food!

Be sure to order it dry as the wet sauce dilutes the fabulous flavors.   The Chinese broccoli on oyster sauce was perfectly prepared and an awesome bargain at $4.95.  Our last dish was a curry pork tendon with rice.  This is an acquired taste that isn't for me. My better half says it is quite tasty and well prepared.  I will take her word for it.    The service is what you would expect from a Chinatown restaurant.  It is brisk, efficient and non-personal.  I have grown used to this type of service so it does not bother me.  The facility could use a bit of TLC.  The door on the men's room is broken, the tables/chairs are a bit rundown.    The takeout business is brisk and when you eat the BBQ here you can understand why.   Great place for hardcore foodies!",

The plate gets all of these served on a bed of rice with some Chinese broccoli, and it makes a huge meal.  Got the won ton soup based on all the other rave reviews- I like that the broth was actually seasoned, and the won ton filling had a good sesame oil flavor, but this dish doesn't travel well and is probably best left off your list if you're grabbing takeout.  As others say, the service is uh, \"authentic\"? Don't expect the staff to understand you without making various hand gestures and/or pointing.

The BBQ pork is delicious and saucy, but not my favorite out of the three types of meat.   This place is always busy and packed with Chinese locals (good sign btw).

My boyfriend and I have been coming here for four years and I don't know why it's taken me so long to finally write a review on this place until now. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Whether if you're dining in or taking out, the service here is pretty quick. We ordered the food to go and didn't wait long at all. My boyfriend and I ordered our usual for dinner tonight- bbq pork and roast pork with a side of daikon. Everything was delicious! Both meats were extremely tender, moist, and flavorful. I definitely recommend this place! By the way, keep in mind that this place is cash only.",

I guess if you want Hong Kong style BBQ or you have the moods for a bowl of wonton noodle when you are Las Vegas. This is one of the good one. The service is like most of the Chinese restaurants. Don't expects too much. It is ok! Price is little higher than the same style restaurants in Los Angeles or San Francisco Bay Area. The location is good. Not very far from Chinatown in Las Vegas. Only about five minutes drive. Big parking lot, very easy to found a parking. The area looks safe. This time they are not as busy as before. I guess is because they increased the price! But I will still come next time, unless I found another better Hong Kong BBQ and noodle restaurant in Las Vegas.",

Apologies to the cashier for putting you through all of that. But money is money. Luckily I had enough to pay for my food.  Super popular spot for Chinese bbq! They serve anything from roast duck to bbq pork to roast pork to ginger chicken and hainan chicken. Despite the horrible service, you will still leave happy. $9.99 for their two-bbq entree rice platter which is a lot of food. They give you a huge mound of rice, chinese greens, and your choice of two bbq items. Definitely worth the money if you are craving some greasy chinese bbq.  Roast Pork: a crispy layer of skin, 90%fat, and 10% salty pork. I literally had mounds of fat leftover after I dissected the pork layer out. Eat with caution!  Roast Duck: Overly flavored and very salty. I felt like they overseasoned the duck or maybe I am just spoiled from the roast duck in San Francisco. Super oily but still yummy.  Ginger Chicken: Delicious and garnished with a lot of ginger! My favorite of the bunch. Didn't come with too many bones either so it was easy to eat.",

    "text": "My wife and I live next to LV Chinatown. We don't go out all that often but when we do, I'd say 90% of the time we go here, which is known to us as Tung Ky.  Yeah, it's cash only - so what? Yeah, it's tiny, generally packed, and utilitarian. Yeah, the servers' English isn't all that great. But what you really need to understand is that this restaurant isn't the least bit tailored for Americans or their tastes. They have their niche, they have their customers, and it's not down on Spring Mountain where the tourists generally go, so you're not going to get anything remotely approaching a tourist experience when you go there. It's not what this restaurant exists for.  I generally get BBQ pork over rice for carry-out. My wife, who worked in Hong Kong for many years, generally gets roast duck over rice, and swears it's the best she's had in the States. But with her in Asia this week, guiding her mother and father over here for an extended visit, I've been dining in the restaurant for a change. Sauteed vegetables with beef over rice? First-rate. Singapore noodles? Absolutely delicious. So what's it going to be tonight? BBQ pork chow fun? One of their noodle soups with numerous add-ins to choose from? Could be, could be.  But the beef with black bean sauce chow fun is delicious and the XO sauce rice rolls are great, as is practically everything else we've had there in the 8 or 9 years we've been going there. It's fine if you don't like it - they're not going to miss you if you blow them off for whatever reason.  Certain tourists seem to think that LV is a big adult theme park, where everything should be up to THEIR standards. Uh-uh, not here; this is an extremely popular hole-in-the-wall that happens to make first-rate everyday food tailored primarily for Cantonese and northern Vietnamese tastes, and that's IT. And having worked as an expat in HK for several years after living right next to San Francisco Chinatown, I prefer to eat at Tung Ky than at any other Chinese joint in the neighborhood. As long as your expectations are realistic, it's that good.",

    "text": "This place used to be my to go place whenever I'm craving for some congee or noodles. I always order the chicken and bbq pork rice plate. Today, the food did not meet my expectation and the services was horrible.  I am Chinese and I order my food in Chinese where they can understand. It started off okay, and I ordered what I usually get: - Cold Spicy Chicken Feet - BBQ Pork Belly -  Lean Pork and Century Egg Congee - Salty Fish & Chinese Sausage Fried Rice - Ginger Chicken (Half) - Chinese Fried Dough   The food came and I was not impress. Cold Chicken Feet usually come with a white vinegar dipping sauce, so I asked the server if they have any. She paused for so long and kept telling me there's vinegar on the table (red vinegar). I told her that's not the one for this dish. She then paused so long again, and said she will ask the kitchen. After like 10 second, every server/cooks were screaming and said they have no white vinegar. The whole act is not necessary. Can simply tell me they don't have that. Next dish was the BBQ Pork Belly. It's one of their signature dish, but it was so salty! I love salty food but I feel like this one, I'm biting into a big piece of salt block. Moving on to Chinese Fried Dough, nothing special other than its cold as usual. Next is the Lean Pork and Century Egg Congee... It was so thick, like extra thick with no taste. It used to be so flavorful. Looking at it was so depressing. Then Salty Fish and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice came, the egg was over cooked. It was so dry and ruined the whole fried rice. Lastly the Ginger Chicken, I believe they change the method of cooking it. It just tasted weird.   At the end, I asked the server to give me some to go boxes and sauce container so I can bring it home. The server only gave me one sauce container but I wanted 2, so I asked for another one. She stop and stare at me for the longest time and questioning me why I need another one. First, you shouldn't be asking why I need one. It's just not professional to do that. Second, after I explained I need it for the ginger scallion sauce, she still look at me and question me. Like, just give me another one. I don't know if she is new to being a server, or she just so slow. I even speak to her in Cantonese. It was a stressful yet horrible lunch. I would give 0 star if I can and  I will most likely never going to go back again.",

I've often heard about the amazing food here and I finally had the chance to try it.    The go-to combo off of Yelp was the 2-meat BBQ combo which I chose the Roast Duck and the Pork.   The dish came with a generous serving of white rice along with some Chinese broccoli on the side and hoison and sweet & sour sauces to dip in.  Absolutely loved it.  Good portions.  Tasty food.  Why haven't I came here sooner?  My wife ordered the Beef Chow Fun (no gravy, dry) which was very good as well.  The beef were sized pretty well and the taste was spot on.   The portions were a good size and it was enough for the two of us.    Service was fast.  Food came out fast.  I'll come back again real soon and I'll hope to try the soups in addition to that mouth-watering pork and roast duck.  Mmm Mmm.",

    "text": "I walked in at Asian BBQ & Noodles and I saw pork and duck hanging - a positive sign of good authentic Chinese food.  Everybody who was eating here were Chinese and some Vietnamese.  The servers were speaking to me and my sister in Chinese and it felt like Beijing all over again.  It's a tiny place that seats 50 people.  We ordered roast pork, yang chow fried rice and Chinese broccoli since we weren't too hungry.  The traditional Chinese restaurant would serve you dishes one at a time and it's usually the quickest one to prepare is the one that gets served first.  So, we got the broccoli then the roast pork.  We were dying to eat the pork already since the skin looked so crispy and delicious...but we had to control ourselves and wait for the rice.  It didn't take long.  The broccoli was fresh.   The pork was super crispy and succulent - honestly, the best pork from a Chinese restaurant in Vegas!  I was very pleased and all I could say to myself was \"HAOCHI! HAOCHI!\" (delicious).  The fried rice had a lot of stuff in it: chopped green veggies, eggs, BBQ pork and shrimps.    We took a BBQ pork rice bowl to-go.  I tried a piece and it was delish!  Their food is inexpensive too!  It's like $6-7 for a rice bowl and you get a lot of food.  If I was blown away by one dish, I can't wait to try the other items on their menu!  I'll definitely try their roast duck and something else next time.  Other Chinese restaurants in Vegas marginal roast pork. There's a particular place with a type of flower in their name that microwaves their roast pork making the skin gross and chewy.  I'm also not concerned with the use of MSG...in China, they give you a small saucer of MSG!  I never get headaches from it so I don't care!",

The restaurant itself is not too big and the ambience feels a bit old style like the 80s.    BBQ Platter was great here, not restaurant style with fancy stuff in the middle, just 3 types of meats.  Roasted Pork, Char Siu, and Duck were all delicious.   The half of a chicken was good, and they sliced up the breast prior to serving it to reduce the effort needed to chew through it.  We got some pig feet and pig blood noodles, not something you can get everywhere, but they did a fine job on those too.  Their XO Rice Roll was a surprising discovery, as it came with stir-fried eggs, which most restaurant does not.  Visually gave a stunning appeal, the eggs did not do much to improve the dish, and it tasted about the same as other places.  After visiting many Chinese restaurants in Vegas, Asian BBQ & Noodles definitely stands out among them.  Service was decent and they were quick to response to various requests we had.  Oh, and remember to bring CASH.",

These folks keep it 100% for sure. Nothing fancy smanchy, just straight to the point good food. And heads up it's CASH only....yes CASH is King/Queen here. Top 3 must order: #23 BBQ 2 combo platter get the BBQ and Roast Pork. #35 is a The Wonton Egg Noodle soup, great to share for sure. And last, but not least #86 Rice Roll w/Xo sauce.

    "text": "I am always on the lookout for the best, most authentic BBQ duck and pork in Las Vegas, so that is why I tried Asian BBQ & Noodles.    They nailed the first test by having their meats hanging in the kitchen.  I ordered the BBQ duck and pork two meal platter, which came with rice, some veggies, and soup.  This was all for under $10!  The BBQ dishes had bones still in the meat, which I guess is how it's supposed to be served, authentically, but I would have preferred it to be deboned before served.  The portions were also solid and the juices very tasty, overall.  The prices are almost impossible to beat in Las Vegas.  I was just hoping for a more authentic BBQ meat dish when I walked in.  Overall good for the price but not a must try with so many great Asian restaurants in Las Vegas.",

We waited 35 minutes. After ordering our food, we realized people around us were getting theirs before us, but they were seated after us. Our waiter never once came to check in us. My husband had to go and ask for our dishes. We got the porridge after our complaint. Then 15 minutes later we had to go ask for our meat dish(realize porridge and bbq plate does not require any real cooking time.) After finishing our porridge and bbq plate we still hadn't received our chow fun (note this was already 50 minutes after we ordered). We asked for it to be taken off our bill. The supervisor got into an argument telling us if we want to cancel a dish we need to give them a heads up. We explained that we had to go after each dish to be put on our table. He told us are we sure we had to do that, pretty much said we were lying. Let's just say after the argument, he did not understand our point. We took it to go, dumped it and will never return.",

    "text": "I haven't tried a lot of things from this restaurant but from what I did try, everything was deliciously yummy. Their prices are awesome as well -- they're not going to burn a hole in your wallet however! It is CASH ONLY. So don't come here with a credit card cause that isn't going to help you. Although the wonderful thing is, there is a Wells Fargo, Chase, and BoA somewhere down the street of Spring Mountain.   Like many people have said .. absolutely LOVE their roast pork. It is full of flavor and a good combination of meat and fat. It goes GREAT with rice! So don't be afraid to get that combo :P  Their roast duck and bbq pork is only okay though. I've had better bbq pork. As for their roast duck, it's good however their sauce ruins it for me. They left the herbs in the sauce and the concentration of the flavors of the herbs are just too much for me ..it ruins the flavor of the duck rather than complimenting it.   Also, love their noodles and fried rice. I've tried their \"chei jai mein\" which is a street cart food back overseas. For here, you get to choose the type of noodle you want then choose 1-3 items, such as pork intestines and pork blood. It was quite yummy :D Wasn't bad at all. BUT, I typically like to use chili oil with my noodles however theirs isn't that great ... Next time, I'll bring my own!   Awesome authentic Chinese food. Can't go wrong. Don't worry about the service cause for the food you get, to hell with service. It's a Chinese place ... just be loud when trying to get their attention and you're good to go! HAHA  But in all reality, when I've eaten here, I haven't really experienced any rude attitude  .. maybe because I haven't been here enough? Tehee.   Give it a try :) If anything, just order take out.",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant with a group of friends last night and accidentally left my purse on the chair. Quite a bit of cash, drivers license, and and a few credit cards. Came back this am before they opened to hopefully retrieve it to be met with hostile employees and their \"boss\" (2 different chefs claim to be the owner) telling me that it wasn't there without checking. When I asked for them to check the cameras that were directly facing our table, they kept telling me no and making excuses saying it would take too much time. After pleading with them once again to just let me take a look, I knew the exact time we were there and it would have taken 15 min tops to check, they started threatening to call the police. My Chinese isn't that good but I figured it would be easier to communicate with them in Chinese than English and the \"boss\" started yelling at me that I was accusing them of stealing when I was just trying to explain that I wanted to see what happened to my purse. I may have used the wrong Chinese term and there was a miscommunication, but when I tried to explain that to him he got even more mad and started yelling at me more about how they are too busy (there were 3 tables of people and 10 employees who were mostly standing around) and to leave.   What probably happened was one of the employees found it and kept the cash and the purse and they are covering for them. There's a luxury good resale store next door so I'm almost positive I'll see my Purse there the next day.   I've already filed a police report so hopefully they are able to do something before the \"boss\" erases the footage which he probably did the moment I left the restaurant.   I seriously don't understand how someone, let alone a whole restaurant, can be that shady and crooked and get away with it.   As for the food... meh. Had the duck and pork and the beef chow fun. Duck taste like every other BBQ duck place. Pork was ok but the skin was a bit too crispy verging towards too damn hard. Beef chow fun was ok. Nothing special but too much bean sprouts.",

Just one person ahead of us, so I couldn't figure out why it was taking so long.  The restaurant is very cramped, so there is really no convenient place to wait out of people's way.  The meat was also just okay, the smell was overwhelming in my car and fridge, yet the meat was a little bland.  Duck had a lot of bone, so it was less than I thought once I removed the meat off it (lots of fat too and not really as crispy as I would prefer).  Pork was a little dry.

Service here has always been questionable but they would at least get the order correct and the BBQ meats were generally good.  This day, it was horrible.  We ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, Congee and added a 3 meat combo with BBQ Pork, Roast Pork and Ginger Chicken.  After a little while, the Congee and Noodle soup came out.  The meats didn't show up until the Congee and Noodle soup was almost finished.  To make it worse, they gave us Duck instead of the BBQ Pork.  After trying to grab a server for a few minutes, we gave up and decided to just eat what was served.  The Ginger Chicken was anemic, compared to past meals, and the Roasted Duck just tasted off and mushy.  The Roasted Pork was good.  We ate, left most of the Chicken and Duck, paid and walked out.  On the way out, one of the servers was cleaning something up and put a \"wet floor\" sign on the ground.  Walked around the sign and before you know it, foot slipped and fell hard.  It wasn't water.  They spilled oil or grease on the ground and didn't bother covering it up.  These people are generally clueless, rude and generally act like they don't care.  But ... still came back for their BBQ meats.  Not anymore.  They're just lucky I don't sue.",

Instead of being racist and talked like that he could've just told us NO or at least be more friendly not with an attitude. He took an ordered so quick, we did not even finished, he left. He came back with a wrong dish(of course because in the beginning we already asked if he could speak vietnamese....my bf was confused between the pig intestine w/ pig stomach) so i guessed we ordered a wrong dish and so of course we were very nice and asked him can we get a different dish which is \"pig stomach\". He stared at us for 5 secs and said \"no. Cant take in no more. They already cut\" and I said \"ok? Can we just get a different dish and i will pay for it too no big deal\" he literally stood there and kept saying no. He acted like we don't have money to pay! I was so mad I stood up bout to leave, he immediately changed the way how he talked and said \"ok i don't know what u want\" he grabbed the menu, gave it to me, ran away and never return. LOL.

    "text": "Really good roast pork and wonton noodle there.  Very legit hong kong flavor.  The roast pork has cripsy skin and soft tender meat, While the wonton soup and noodle are very good. They also have very good porridge and steam vegetable, very cheap and fresh.   It is very hidden in the plaza but once you open the door is a happening scene with full house of people eating and ordering. The smell of it will hit you in your face instantly.  I went on a late sunday morning and there is a line waiting to get it. They are listed the \"Top\" 100 chinese food. The only thing I didnt like is the chinese donut, its not crispt and light enough. And the bbq pork is a bit dry. Overall still a pretty authentic bbq meat and wonton place. Oh and try the ginger chicken that is really good, soft and tender with grinded ginger and green onion sauce!!",

    "text": "Damn this place for being so delicious!!!  We started going to this place when it first opened. ... I'm going to guess around five years ago.  Back then a  roast duck rice was 5 bucks.   Now that same dish is 8 bucks.  Quite an increase!!!  .. But so good!!!!  Their business is so good that they close on Fridays! !!! What restaurant can do that!!!   I think the owner is the cashier lady.  We have been there probably 20 times and have never seen her smile.   Next time I go,  I will tell her that given how good her business is she should be smiling like the Joker!  Food. .. Bbq pork- most of the time the meat is not to fatty.  Has great flavor and tender.  Roast duck- about 50 percent of the time you will get a great combination of crisp skin,  minimal fat,  and wonderful tender duck.   The other times you will get too much fat and soggy skin. Roast pork- same review as duck but I would say 75 percent of time it's crispy, minimal fat and delicious.   Pan fried noodles- one of the best I have had.   It's not oily.  My guess is that they fry the noodles well ahead of time and drain the oil properly.  I would request this with a black been sauce.   Crisp noodles and delicious sauce.   It is literally a place that will make you smile when you take a bite of the food.",

Perfectly crispy skin paired with juicy and fatty meat is the ultimate combination.   *Thumbs down* It's located in rather shady-looking strip mall plaza a few more blocks down from the Monta/Raku/Kabuto strip mall on Spring Mountain. That may make some people nervous, others however, right at home. Language barrier can be an issue, but they speak enough English and you can always point at the menu.",

First occasion, I ordered a packet of rice with BBQ pork , roast duck n pork belly to go. I asked the lady for extra sauce with my meat, when I got home there weren't any so I guessed maybe she might have forgotten. Fine !!!  Yesterday, I ordered the same item again. This time round, I ask the same lady again : \"can u PLEASE give me extra sauce. Here comes her answer : \"There's already sauce on you rice\". and she was real eager to collect $$$ from me and get me out of her sight. obviously I knew it, doesn't she understand what is EXTRA sauce?   Could not explain how angry I was when I left the shop. I was asking myself maybe I should have asked her :\" Can I pay you for some extra sauce?\"",

Almost everything on the menu was under 6 bucks.   They even have a font 20 menu for the grandmas and grandpas.  I ordered the Roast Pork Shrimp Dumpling Noodle for $5.99  Price - 5 stars Noodles - 3 stars Broth - 3 stars Roast Pork - 1 star Shrimp Dumpling - 3 stars Service - 2 stars  I was really disappointed with the Roast Pork, because all the pieces I got were straight up bone; with the exception of one small piece.

I ordered BBQ Pork, Crisp Pork Belly, Beef Chow Fun, Veg Fried Rice and Singapore Noodles. She didn't take my name but out the order in. There's no real waiting area so we moved around getting out of the way. Others came in ordered and left. I think because we ordered stir fry from the back it took longer. After 22 minutes I asked the server to check . She showed that the BBQ itenms were there and then I saw 2 of the items come out. Still waiting on the rice. Approached the counter again, ignored again. It made me feel as if they didn't want me there or my business. I waited 5 more minutes then turned and walked out without my order. I can't comment on the food for obvious reasons.",
