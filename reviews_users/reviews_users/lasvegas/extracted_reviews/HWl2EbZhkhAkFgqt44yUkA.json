    "text": "Ugh, I really want to give this place 2 stars or even 1 star .... but the lady there that makes balloon hats was such a delight !!! We basically ordered 2 drinks (BOGO yard drinks) I guess i can't really expect much when it's a BOGO deal. But we ended up getting this frog-arita drink (guava flavor) which was wayyyyyy too sour. it tasted so horrible and actually killed my buzz. We asked them to re-make it and it was exactly the same taste .... i'm sure they just took our drink back & didn't bother making us a new one.   But the lady there that goes around and makes balloon hats for everyone was so sweet and creative! We were there for the ASD convention show and we showed her our company logo and she made an exact replica of our logo in balloon form!!! Quite amazing and impressed, I'll say!  This place is in the Treasure Island hotel and has many tables & seating. Not only that, they also have a MC and a dance floor. They were offering free shots to people that were on the dance floors, as well as KTV on the stage. I'll give them credit that they try to make it as festive and upbeat as possible, but the drinks and our waitress was not too pleasant.",

The fajitas were okay but there was nothing exciting about them. The chicken included with them and on the taco salad was good quality, but as for the veggies and fixings, not so much. I'm convinced the cheese used as topping was craft because it had that pre shredded waxy coating. Also the salad mix was fresh out of a bag. Definitely not worth it when you are paying so much for a salad. You are paying for the atmosphere for sure because it is in a cool location, but that was the only exciting part about this establishment.",

There were no drink specials offered aside from all you can drink or $33 yards.  We had older family there who wouldn't drink that much and the drinks were very expensive.  The food was great though. I asked at 830 to be able to throw my bouquet and had to ask again at 1030.  They didn't do anything special for us at all.  There was nothing done to encourage us to stay there so we all left.  With a very wasted amount of unlimited drink tickets and a boring wedding reception.   It was the worst part of my wedding and very disappointed in this establishment for making me carry a bad memory of my wedding. I would not go back:(",

This place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY past 7 PM. But what place in Vegas is? The staff was drunk and the manager was a little creepy... the bouncer was telling me that the managers buy free shots for the girls that come in. Once again, not a surprise in Vegas.  Good view! You can sit outside by the water and pirate ships.  Overall, for the price, why not??",

I ordered mini burgers which were pretty good as well, nothing super memorable. It was fun how they bring around different signs that point you out in a funny way... we all got a kick out of that.

I've never been to a Senor Frogs in Mexico, but I imagine this is what their spring break must look like. They even had champagne showers...  We headed outside after a while and I must admit that it wasn't that bad. I used to love coming here when the place was Social House, that terrace is awesome! We ended up ordering some yards of margaritas (I know, how cliche) and enjoying the Sirens show up close. The drinks were expensive though.   I guess I didn't have such a bad time since I left at two, which is super late for me.",

The second time, we waited for an hour for a table and they tried to seat us in the bar where a giant loud party was happening. If we wanted to sit in the bar and be constantly bumped by people dancing and drinking, we would have gone there to begin with. When we brought it to the attention of the person seating us, she said \"Sorry, it's Vegas\" and walked away. We would have been fine to wait longer for an actual table for two that wasn't in the middle of a party, but she wouldn't even give us that option. We left and will never go back again. There are several great Mexican Restaurants on the strip, so there is no reason to settle for one that doesn't care about their guests. Believe me, the food and service is not worth it.",

We were ignored by the hostess, until we said aloud, \"you could at least say hi\". She proceeded to walk 20 ft ahead of us to the table. We sat down. 20 minutes pass by. Nobody came to the ask about drinks. No body came to take our order. Right when we decided to stand up and leave the waiter approached us. We asked to speak to the manager, informed him of our experience. Manager just stared with a smirk on his face. Not even an apology! Horrible service! Horrible management! You would think the manager would be interested why 5 paying customers would get up and leave.Whoever owns this place should think of hiring people that are interested in being in the hospitality business. One star for the cool decorations.",

It wouldn't hurt to add a tad bit more chicken to your 25$ fajitas plate and maybe even give more tortillas without charging a buck.

The ladies are captivating, talented, and beautiful!  Great interaction with the audience, great music.  Gorgeous dancing! Bring lots of dollar bills.  The food was also both a pro and a con...some of it was great, like the bacon, salsa, lox, and...well, that was it.  The eggs were dry and much of the other food was super carb-ie and bland.  The plates are small, too. I like to eat, and it was hard to fit the food on my plate.  Difficult to carry coffee and stuff through to my seat, since the tables are super close together.  I didn't love sharing a table with two random dudes, either, with us five ladies celebrating a birthday.  That being said, I would go back with a groupon price again, because it was a lot of fun and the ladies make it worth it.  Slightly better food, slightly more cordial service on the way in and out, and maybe a little more space between tables would greatly improve the experience.",

The show is on the second floor of the restaurant and almost every seat gives a good view of the stage.  The performers were very good and the show was entertaining.  The food did leave a bit to be desired.  There was an assortment of breakfast and Mexican foods served buffet style.  Much of the breakfast food was cold, and the waffles and french toast were hard as a rock.  The eggs and breakfast meat selections were good, and most of the Mexican selections were tasty.  Service was good and everyone was very friendly.  An improvement on the quality of the buffet items would have made this a five star event.",

We were starving by the time we sat down to eat and wanted to get everything moving quickly so by the time the server came for our order we were all set to go. I told her id like a bottled water and that id want an alcoholic drink in probably ten minutes ( the water I got was 8oz and cost 4$).   So after waiting about 35 minutes for our food, someone from the kitchen brings it out and rushes of before we realize we have no silverware! And then it took us another 15 min to flag someone down. So I asked him if he could take my drink order because we haven't seen our server in now over 30 minutes. He said he would tell her. 15 minutes go by and I flag the same kid down and tell him she hasn't been back! He says he can take my order now and I tell him I want a margarita. We wait another ten minutes or so and the server ( who we haven't seen since she took our food order) comes back and asks for my ID! At this point we're so fed up with this place we ask for our check  (which took her a while to get back to us, of course)  I wouldn't recommend this place what so ever, the bill was expensive the service was horrible, I would of rather gambled that money away then have to sit through something like that again.",

You come here because you want to see pasty, chubby white college chicks in stupid balloon hats pounding sugary drinks, raging sloppily in a sad attempt to drown out the unspeakable misery their shitty futures hold: double-wides, obesity and litters of squalling, snot-nosed brats.  YES, it's unbearably loud -- you'd welcome ear-splitting shitty Top 40 music too, if you were trying to drown out the squalor of your miserable existence. If you want nice quiet conversation-level music, git your ass over to some elitist liberal hotbed that serves tapas and jazz. Senor Frog's is for REAL AMURRICANS! And real Amurricans like their music LOUD and SHITTY!  YES, it's overpriced, crappy bar food. What the fuck do you expect from a tourist franchise catering to hordes of sunburned fat-asses disgorged by cruise ships listing dangerously from all the excess weight crossing the gangplank??!  For reals, people. The only reason to come here is to ogle depressing drunk middle-Americans.

With that being said I really wanted to tour around and not yet experience the club life. As we walked around the strip during the day I saw this place and it immediately catched my attention. Long story short we went back later on to have dinner here, which the food was very delicious and serving sizes were huge. The waiter was super polite and fun. We stayed for the night life and it was such an amazing experience. The environment and vibe is just so lit, friendly, and overall fun. Loved the variety of music they played and the drinks were on point. Cant wait to go back to Vegas to visit Senor Frogs again.",

I couldn't believe the crowd! It was a packed house! IMHO the price is a bit high but they do have a Groupon. And if you're there for a birthday celebration they may give you an entry for free! Even though we got in line early, our table was in kind of a crappy spot, you can pay more to be a VIP and get better seats.  As soon as you get to your table the champagne and OJ is waiting for you. Then get in line for the brunch buffet which had regular breakfast fare and Mexican items as well. The food was pretty blah but once you start downing mimosas, you will be wishing you had some food in your stomach! The staff was fantastic and made sure we always had a bottle of champagne and OJ through out the show. We went through 15 bottles! I have never been to a drag show and have never watched RuPauls Drag Race but this was an absolute blast. The Queens were beautiful and put on a great show, I can't believe how well they dance in those outfits and heels! Don't be shy...there will be audience participation as well. I highly recommend giving this show a try if you have a free afternoon with nothing to do!",

The Big Watermelon is delicious for adults! The brownie dessert is sooo amazing and delicious!! Shareable for at least 3 or more people.   The atmosphere is casual with fun signs all over the walls and ceiling to look at, read, and laugh. Booster seats and high chairs are available for kids along with a kids menu complete with crayons. A lady making balloon hats came around and made a purple flower hat for our daughter. Super fun and cute!   Staff is all friendly and helpful and service is quick.

NO  Is this where you come and take shots in a friendly environment and get away with getting tipsy because your family deems it as a restaurant. Why YES, yes it is.  I've always had a soft spot for Senor Frogs because it was one of the spots I went to with my siblings and parents when we took our first big family vacation outside the states in Cancun. I was super young but I do remember they almost poured a shot into my sister's mouth when we were doing the congo with everyone. FUNNY STORY  I've made it a point to visit every location including their sister restaurant- El Squid Roe (now that place is bomb check my review on their Cabo San Lucas location).  SF makes some fun drinks and the decor is really gritty. Plenty of hidden puns and if you pay attention like you do with a \"Where's Waldo\" book you'll find some hidden gems.  You can either drink/dine outside or inside where it tries to have a club setting.  Their drink menu selection is fun and note that you can get it cheaper if you don't want the souvenir cup.  Food selection is ok and it'll do the trick but you're clearly not coming here for food. It should solely be about the drinks.",

The veggie burrito had zucchini and squash that was excellently cooked and the balsamic salad dressing really enhances things. If you're looking for a quick and tasty lunch, look no further.   Pro Tip: If you're really hungry this restaurant is easy to find and get to unlike some restaurants which are hidden in casinos.",

This location has two dance floors and on the night of August 12, 2017 the upper level had Latin music and the lower level played popular pop and hip hop music. Everyone there were simple there to have a great time. There is even a stage where people are able to get on stage and drink. There were also women walking around selling $3 shots.   The bathrooms for senior frog aren't located inside of the restaurant/ bar. They are located directly in front of the restaurant. They are bigger than most restaurant bathrooms because they share them with Treasure Island Casino.  I will defiantly be returning to this location.",

TBH, I wasn't expecting much even after the oddly positive NYT review of the Times Square location.  But this was a pretty damn decent lunch.  There was a wait for a table at 12:30 on a weekday.  They notify you by text message when your table is ready.  You can choose to sit inside or outside, where there is a view of the Siren's Cove and the strip.  But it was hot out and I prefer indoor tables.  Diva.  Wait was only about 15 minutes.  Service was very friendly and quick.  No issues whatsoever with the Living Social deal.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is quirky, casual and fun.  They really push the Yard drinks but it was lunch time and I'm not 19 so we passed on those.  We started with the guac and chips (11.25).  Nice and fresh tasting guacamole and chips served in a paper bag (?).  Good way to start a meal here.  I had the sliders with fries from the appetizer menu ($14.75).  Large portion - plenty to eat as a main course.  And they were pretty good.  I was happy.  She had the veggie fajitas ($14.25), and she deemed them \"excellent\".  Again, very large portion size.  Senor Frogs delivers on the value for your buck.  We really enjoyed our lunch here and the Living Social was a terrific deal...  highly recommend you grab that deal if you see it and hit up Senor Frogs in Vegas.",

I've been to other locations throughout the country and I wanted to take my brother on Christmas Eve here as we were traveling and he's always been fascinated with frogs so it was fun to go here and have some \"frog\" drinks and dinner. I called 5 times over the past month, most recently 4 days before Xmas eve to ask if they were open and until when. I was told we could be seated until 10pm. We show up at 8:50 and are told they are closing at 9pm and I received the wrong information (all 5x I called) and we could sit if we knew exactly what we wanted and would be out quickly. That made us uncomfortable and rushed, and it would of been an unenjoyable meal.  Why I'm angry? I called several times asking for their hours and was told the wrong information, leaving us to find somewhere else at 9:00 and me to never get to show my brother what I wanted to. All they had to do was tell me the correct hours and I would of went earlier! I get it's Xmas but a) everywhere else on the strip was open all night and b) there is no reason to make us feel unwelcome  They were closed on Xmas day so I never got to take my brother.. and further I would never go back to this location when I'm in Vegas. 0 stars for giving me wrong information several times. Don't bother going here - go to The Coffee Shop in treasure island, where we ended up.",

The food was okay. Not really worth the money. What really made me mad was the 2 for 1 yard drink special. That cost $40, which took me by surprise. Furthermore, the bikini contest didn't start at 10:30. Nor at 11:00, or 11:30. I got so frustrated at having to wait for the one thing my girlfriend and I came for that we left at midnight.  All in all Senor Frog's serves overpriced drinks ($40 yards and $8.50 Michelob Ultra), overpriced food, and doesn't deliver on what is advertised. Moreover, the contestants are made up of whoever may be in the crowd at the time, so it's a huge scam to sell expensive drinks and mediocre food. Don't waste the time or money.",

    "text": "Avoid this sheisty tourist trap. Eight of us dined here Thursday night, and the waiter, Felix, tried to scam our party on the check. My group ordered drinks, food, and several rounds of shots. Two people in the group, including myself, were not drinking, so we had our logical thinking caps on. It started off with Felix telling us he could not divide up the check as it would back up the system for too long. We were the only group on the patio, but we did not want to be a pain, so we told him OK.   Next let me just say that the food is really over-priced. I paid $15.99 for a cheese quesadilla that was all cheese and tortilla with small scoops of sour cream, guac, pico, and jalapenos. It was good, but not $16 good.   Also, I tried to walk outside to take a phone call as the music is blaring on the inside. The bouncer carded me - on the way out, and told me if I left without showing him my ID I would not get stamped to come back in. Ummm, dude, it is obvious I am coming from the inside, so just stamp my hand already. Why the grief? Plus he was a dick. I just went back inside. I'm not trying to waste my time to walk back to the patio, fish my ID out of my purse, walk back to the front to show him my ID to satisfy his doorman power-trip.   Now, back to Felix. When we ask our waiter, Felix, for our bill, he returns with a receipt for $360. It just shows the total as he already ran the credit card. One girl in our party had given him her card to pay for one round of drinks, and ended up charged for the entire thing. We had to ask for an itemized receipt. Felix told us the computer did not print itemized receipts. One member of our party was standing next to him at the computer and said, \"yes it does. There is the button for it right there. Just press it\", and voila - the itemized receipt was printed. Upon viewing it, we discovered we had been charged an automatic gratuity. Felix the waiter purposely did not give us the itemized receipt hoping to get double gratuity.  The pricing on the shots was pretty questionable as well. Felix was extremely shady about the entire thing and not cooperative at all. Felix swindles tourists.    Everyone in the group left feeling like they had been taken. My advice is to just avoid this place all together. There really isn't any redeeming quality about it. Want to visit a Senor Frogs - hit the one in Cancun instead.",

When you taste the food at Senor Frog's while sober you might find it hard to come back a second time. But even with the BOGO deal on the drinks there are limitations as far as the selection available for the voucher. Do I really want a Bud Light? Nah. Do I want a house margarita mixed with the crappy tequila? No, thanks.   The only thing that was decent was the chips and salsa. The taco salad would've been acceptable too but the chicken was way overcooked. I understand chicken breast can be dry some times but this one was beyond dry. It was desert dry. I guess this suits the environment. The new tag line for the chicken taco salad should be, \"Think the Las Vegas desert is dry? Try our chicken salad.\" Get your jaw muscle ready because you'll be chewing for awhile.   The worst part is the price point doesn't match the quality. With a beer and entree you're looking at around $25-$30 per person for a disappointing meal.",

    "text": "Senor Frogs visited 8/15 (Saturday)  Today, it seems like everyone is offended by everything and that the slightest thing will tick someone off.  These reviews for Senor Frogs are just ridiculous, people demand so much perfection, its actually hilarious reading these and how pathetic each individual sounds.  By the way, if you want perfection, then go to a 4 star $100+ restaurant; quit wasting everyone's time complaining.  Regardless, Senor Frogs, what a great place!  I purchased the groupon ($20 for $40) and the Yard drink groupon ($33 for 2 yard drinks)  Waited about 15min to be seated, they can take your phone number down and text you when your table is available, so it's not biggie going inside TI to play some, instead of waiting in the very small waiting area, definitely a nice perk.    Let's start off with the food, I went with the burrito and my fiancee went with the fajitas, we also ordered the chips/salsa.  The burrito was unreal, and hard to finish, the fajitas were very filling as well.  Again, not sure what people are complaining about when they say the portion sizes are small??..  Yard Drinks, well, they already have a BOGO, so the groupon is pointless, unless you can snag a promotional discount on groupon (like I did; extra 20% off purchase) which makes it worth buying.  The drink was delicious and they did not cheap on alcohol.    Atmosphere is great; the DJ kept giving away free shots (like every 5 minutes), and entertained with great club like music.  He also made sure to get everyone involved (singing along, clapping, etc).  I guess if you are boring and do not like fun, exciting, loud crowd involvement, then this place is not for you, and you should probably stick to eating at a senior center, though, I have heard those places can get out of control as well.    I will say, without the groupon the prices are slightly steep, but remember, NOTHING is cheap in Vegas, groupon and travelzoo make it way easier to save money, so take advantage of it!  Would definitely 100% eat here again",

    "text": "This review is for the Drag Show Brunch at Senor Frogs only.  This show was amazing!!!  We arrived at 11:00 am for the 11:30 showing.  We started being checked in immediately, and were are able to get our food before the show.  While the Brunch Buffet was okay, the Drinks and entertainment far beyond make up for it.  The Brunch Buffett has a wide variety of breakfast.....cereal, waffles, egg omelets, bacon, sausage, pancakes and also a Mexican lunch option which I wasn't very impressed with.  The lunch option was taquitos, tamales, rice, chimichangas.  They also had additional coffee and grapefruit juice plus fruit and yogurt.  So there is a wide range of food to choose from.  For me though I thought the breakfast was better than the Mexican lunch.  The Drinks......So we bought our tickets and Groupon which you have to redeem both the Groupon and show tickets at the same time.  Also make sure you book the show tickets separately in advance.  Our Groupon was for $57 and the drinks alone were well worth it if you know how expensive a Vegas cocktail is.   If you get the VIP package which we did, we had the entire show of premium open bar plus unlimited mimosas available on the table.  Let me tell you the wait staff was amazing, our bottles on the table were never empty the second a bottle finished they were putting in a new one on ice.  The bartender was awesome, he was quick and those drinks were strong.  You can get seriously wasted during this 2 hour show and they strongly encourage it!!  Between my friends and I, we had 6-8 drinks from the bar each on top of what was on the table.  To top it off when the show is over they tell you to take the bottles on the table with you so many people walked out with full bottles of champagne.  The actual show is AMAZING!!!!  These ladies were fabulous and didn't disappoint.  Chanelle the host will have you laughing from the get go.  The costumes and makeup are incredible.  They work the entire crowd so it didn't matter where you sat.  most performances start on stage and move into the crowd.  And yes they get tips,  but don't worry if you don't have smaller bills, before the show one of the hostesses will exchange you big bills for smaller ones.  And trust me once you see their talents you will be holding up dollar bills for your favorite performers.  Also don't forget to tip your bartenders and wait staff.  They were all great kept our tables clear and our drinks full.  This was well worth it and we had a great time.  I would definitely recommend this show.",

However, the service was lousy. But with their drinks normally costing $12.50 a piece.... The coupons came in handy.   I was never offered a menu at any of the times so I wouldn't know about the food. I'm surprised they didn't want to serve food........",

The food was mediocre at BEST it came out cold and took a long time... prices for drink and food are outrageous and the service was poor probably because they couldn't hear over the blaring loud music ! The only thing they had going for them were the funny quotes on the wall and ceiling.  If you are already drunk it might be a tolerable place otherwise my advice would be skip it !",

This place can get crowded and you may have a 5-10 minute wait to get in the door but once you do you will have a great time. This place is a great option when you don't want to go to a club and just wanna get semi dressed up,and a lil fucked up, you get me ?? It's super fun they play all kinds of music from hip-hop to Matisyahu?!! Lol. If your the Banda kinda person for all the Latinos, and just drunk vacationers in Vegas they have Banda on the back patio. So come check it out. They also sell their own version of a Fat Tuesday. They sell adios drinks by the yard--so pace yourself my friends.",

The chicken was good but about the size of your hand (my hands are not big).  I received huge chunks of yellow and brown core, with barely any leafy green romaine. See pics of the core I received. Would NOT recommend. Over priced and waiter/waitress lacked attention and didn't even say goodbye to us when we left.",

The wings were good... nice spice to them and the fries were good.  Expect to pay twice what you would pay in any other Similar type Mexican restaurant.  All entrees are around $20.    Price for 4 of us was $120 before tip.  At $60 it might have been tolerable... but not at $120.  The atmosphere was fun and I have to give props to the energetic staff that really try to make this feel like the Senor Frogs in Mexico... but the prices are a big turnoff.  I saw 3 groups get seated and leave after looking at the menu while we were there.  I wish we would have done the same.",

Husband ordered fish tacos and it was ok but not much different from any fish taco ordered through a fast food drive thru. I ordered chicken tacos and it was by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. It tasted like chicken boiled in water with a sprinkle of cheese on top. Nothing else. Sure they gave little cups of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole but it didn't help it taste any better. It's like they forgot to season it or something. I only took a few bites and gave up. When you spend $80 for two entrees and drinks you expect some edible food.  Oh and they tell you that you get a mini appetizer with every order so I got mini nachos which consisted of three tortilla chips and it took 30 minutes to get. This place was such a joke. Never again!",

    "text": "You and everyone that you know need to experience Drag Brunch at Senor Frogs Las Vegas. I know that this happens in Senor Frogs in other cities as well but the Las Vegas one is blowing it out of the water! A friend of mine and I decided to partake in the Saturday brunch a few weeks ago and had a blast! First off you walk in to a very exciting environment with energizing music and images in the background that are reminiscent of Studio 54, yet nouveau. My friend and I are fans of RuPaul's Drag Race and if you are as well you will most definitely enjoy your time here and recognize some of your favorite contestants from past shows. The entire thing is hosted by Shangela, and let me just tell you, she KILLS IT!!!! She brings this amazing fun and funny energy that you would think is reserved for an evening or late night show. You will find yourself clapping and laughing at all times. The cast is awesome, we clearly recognized India Ferrah, Yara Sofia, and Coco Montrese. They were excellent! The production numbers were great and the individual numbers take you to a night time drag show vibe. They also do meet and greats at the end, so stick around. You don't have to be a drag queen fan in order to enjoy the show, you just have to be a fan of having a great time, laughing, and if up to it, singing along to the songs.  Now, on to food and drinks, many many dranks! There is a great array of brunch selections. Wether you feel more like breakfast or lunch, there is something there for you. There is a clear Mexican direction in many of the dishes but trust me when I say that there is something for everyone. The bottomless champagne mimosas are ever flowing. Thanks to our server Saidel, we never went empty on either the champagne or orange juice. As a matter of fact, I never saw an empty bottle or a dirty plate on any of the other tables he was tending to. Regardless of how busy it was, he would manage to come around consistently to make sure we were doing great and ask if we needed anything. My only regret is that I did not have enough cash to tip him more. Because the price is a flat cost up front, I didn't have an opportunity to include an additional tip for the amazing service, and there is no atm in the venue. Make sure to bring some extra cash. Also, don't forget its a drag show. Tips tips tips. There is also a full bar if you feel like something extra. If you are on here you probably appreciate great service, you will definitely appreciate not having to worry about a thing with the incredible service you get here. Hopefully you will get Saidel on your visit as well.   Over all you will have a great time, eat yummy food and get taken care of by amazing service. The $50 price may scare some people away, but you will see that you will want to keep going back, I know I will. You won't even think about the price when you are having so much fun being entertained all while enjoying good food and endless champagne. The experience is 21+, my friend and I are already talking about going back with a big group. Its that much fun! I highly recommend this!!!",

    "text": "Went to lunch there yesterday. With restaurant half full they couldn't seat is for 25 min. While we waited we had a couple $7.50 coors lights. After being seated prices were high, but typical for Vegas strip. It took another 15 min for the server to take our drink order, then another 20 min to take our food order(Drinks were empty by then). My wife and I shared fajitas. Food was small portioned and warm at best. Had to wait 20 min for tortillas.   I don't mind paying inflated prices for the experience of eating on the strip, but make me feel like I'm getting some value  for my money. Awful service, poor food, and high prices. If that's what you are looking for to Senior Frogs in TI.",

Their pricing is ridiculous, especially for the quality of microwavable food they serve.  Also, their \"Free Appetizer\" coupons are a joke. You get 6, yes exactly 6, chips with horrible nacho cheese over the top, that looks like it has been sitting for hours. Like I said, the staff is the only good thing about this place, other than that, stay away. For the same price point, you could easily go to a much nicer establishment that cares about what they serve to customers.",

My review is based on atmosphere and music, I cannot speak for the food which I see a lot of poor reviews on.  For a Sunday Night, the DJ kept an upbeat crowd, despite the fact that it was a tad bit dead at first.  Within a few minutes, people were up and dancing around.  When he made us do the Wobble dance, it was almost shoulder to shoulder, but everyone was having a blast.   The drinks were strong, and the 2 for 1 margarita call topped it off.  We wish we came here instead of Pure of Friday.  Cheers",

I like the decor of the place but the place is dirty overall. They need to give it a good deep clean everyday. Another complaint I used the groupon special and my bill came out to $31.48 BUT the manager said I had to spend $30 not including tax. Nothing on their menu is cheap and that's another $10! It's a rip off don't use the groupon and avoid this place. I ended buying a $4 water to make the difference and it was a 4 oz bottle. This place is alright and not worth visiting. I didn't try any of their alcohol drinks because they were so overpriced too.",

The food is hardly edible,  and the drinks are so overpriced that I would have saved money by drinking at the blackjack table.  The first table (outdoor) they tried to seat us at was only half covered, and it was starting to rain more than just a drizzle. I ordered a combo plate that didn't even come complete with all the items that were supposed to be included, and my steak was raw. They tried to charge us for a side of dressing after serving us a salad that had no dressing on it. There's no way the 22oz specialty drink we ordered held 22oz, it had very little alcohol in it, and it cost about twenty bucks.  I have always enjoyed Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies, El Squid Row, etc in Mexico, but do yourself a favor and avoid this store.",

Anyone with a frying pan would be able to cook that same meal. We were expecting more. It also came with a  side of horrendous cole slaw. My wife loves cole slaw and she took only one bite of it.

Their alcohol menu is big and they have decent specials for being on the strip. Unfortunately their food menu was very basic. They don't have a lot of the traditional Mexican entrees. Pretty much quesadillas, chips and fajitas. So I stuck with the enchiladas.   I must say, the enchiladas were definitely tasty. They didn't skimp on the chicken and that sauce had a good flavor and had a nice kick to it. It also came with a small portion of rice and beans which also tasted great. Just like any other place on the strip, it's on the pricey side, but felt it was a fair price after I ate it all. It for sure filled me up.   The bartender had a positive attitude throughout the night and overheard a conversation with the guy next to me telling him he loved his job as a bartender. Believe his name was Jose as well. Senor Frog's, you have a good guy there. Take care of him! I'll most likely be back.",

    "text": "Senor Frogs has a fun little environment. My friends and I were staying at Treasure Island so we got a coupon for a 2 for 1 yard drink and half off a $50 food bill. The food was maybe about $15-$20 a plate so it was definitely overpriced, but we were just getting appetizers so it was easy enough to rack up a $50 order. We got two orders of chicken nachos and corn on the cob which was actually pretty good. I'll admit, we were already a bit tipsy when we arrived so maybe the food tasted better than it would if we had been sober. But hey, I still enjoyed it.   For the yard drinks, we got one Cadillac margarita on the rocks and one frozen strawberry margarita. The Cadillac was strong and well-made. It was enough to share and definitely a good one. The frozen strawberry margarita wasn't that great, probably because it was frozen. It wasn't strong and it tasted like a plain slushie. So for the four of us, our bill (with the coupons) was $40 for the two yard drinks, and $25 for the food. With tax and tip, our total came out to $80. I'd say it was a nice place to kill an hour and it was fun for the novelty, but definitely on the pricier side. I'd still recommend it just for the Cadillac margaritas though!",

The host, Chanel, was AMAZING! So funny, I was laughing so hard I had tears. All the \"women\" looked amazing and were so entertaining.   The food was decent. Nothing exciting or worth going back for. But you're paying for the show & experience not the culinary portion. You had the standard bulk rubber scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, store bought muffins & cereal. Some Mexican food. Chips & salsa, rolled tacos, chimichangas rice & beans, then random Chinese food & some fresh fruit & granola.   I unlimited crooks champagne mimosas and the staff was so tentative and always clearing plates, replacing empty champagne bottles and OJ.   I took one star off for the food and the fact that everything was cash only. And there was no ATM in the place so it limited you. Two girls in our party needed to buy their tickets at the door but we had a reservation. And it was cash only to buy it. They said they would have to go to the atm in the casino and then get back in line. Luckily we all had enough cash to buy their tickets then. Then they have a dollar girl who goes around breaking change to tip the performers. Obviously the more you tip the more attention you get from the performers. They also sell shirts that I would have bought, but again, cash only.   I would definitely be back again, with cash. Lol",

One reason was for hazard reason. Finally when we were told or allowed to sit down - had another waitress say no since only one of us were eating (the rest were drinking only which was $35.00-each). Got the approval from another waitress we sat down. Then told that the person ordering food had to go to the bar to place order. She gets there then told by bartender no (with a what the he//) look. When that was cleared up she was able to order. Then to go to the bathroom was like - trying to get security clearance!! Asked for my ID when I had left my purse with my spouse who was at the table!! Then she had to get approval for me to enter back in!! Will not come back and do not recommend this place - if your planning to come and enjoy yourself.",

We go inside to the bar and there's so many open seating is not even funny.  The place is pretty empty.  The bartender told us there was another bar outside and there might be open seating available on a first come first serve basis.  We go outside and again there's a lot of open seating so we sat in a table (six of us) ready to order drinks and meals.  A waitress comes to the table and instead of welcoming us she asked who had sat us in that table and that we will not get service unless the hostess sat us on one of the tables.  I told her we had been directed to the outside seating but it seems like she was having a bad day (like everyone else in this place) and told us we had to leave that table.  We decided to just leave the place...I mean why would we spend money on a place that will not treat us nice and we are not welcomed.  The place was pretty empty and now I know why.  I will NEVER go to this place again....They should know how to run a business especially a Senor Frogs which in Mexico its a VERY happy place where everyone is welcomed!  Please don't waist your time and money at this place.",

The service was speedy and our waitress was very friendly and helpful, it must be the Vegas norm to be pestered to have your photo taken to put on a postcard as this happened in 2 other restaurants[Cabo Wabo and PBR's) but they got the message that my face should never be put on a postcard and soon went away and bothered some really drunk people, think she got a sale there too...result! Great atmosphere and the bad reviewers should try Tres Rios if they want to see a terrible establishment one I never want to see again! unlike Senor Frogs where i will visit on my next Vegas trip in January.",

Thought maybe this would be better than fighting the crowds, so we called and got reservations.  Senor Frogs was fun - the DJ was getting those in the restaurant up dancing and doing silly things, which of course was a blast to watch.  The signs all over the restaurant were fun to read too.    As to the food, it was okay, but nothing really great.  I don't remember it being extremely pricey - but the drinks were very expensive.  And the reason why we came - to see the show - not the best seats in the house to do that.  We got to see the guy's pirate ship from behind, but couldn't see the girls at all (and of course that is where the action is).    All in all, we had a good time - the wait staff was helpful and friendly and besides price of drinks not alot bad to say about it.  Of course not alot good to say about it either really.  I don't think we'll go back.",

Anyway...for starters...when you check into the hotel (Treasure Island ... which is it's own separate bummer, by the way.  But I'm here to yelp the Frog, so sticking to that for now.)  they give you a slew of what appears to be coupon \"deals\" for you to consider while staying.  Along with their coupons, you'll encounter perched people throughout the casino handing out similar coupons to the same good for nothing over-rated over-priced bar attractions.  However, the coupon says 2-for-1 \"yard\" drink .... so you can't help but wander in and \"check it out\".  So me and my boyfriend did.  Big mistake!!!  We got 2 yard sized margaritas with no alcohol (I didn't order them as virgin drinks either) and a bill for $35 (which included a bar fee) .... I was like WTF?? Bar fee?? ... what the hell is that?? ... I'm being charged to sit in their place, I guess. Whatever.  Back to the drinks....nothing but a complete rip off.  The waiter conveniently over charged me for drinks we didn't order...and later when I brought it to his attention...he said \"my bad\" (LOL...really? That's all you got for me?). Also, when I mentioned the lack of alcohol in my yard size margarita...the waiter brought  me one small shot to pour in....and said \"sorry, next time you visit us, and if the drinks are weak, just let me know. I'll take care of you.\" (again,  I'm laughing and shaking my head).  I suggest you turn around and walk back out before you sit down and get trapped.  Next!!! BTW... the place seems to attract the really duncy type of college kids.  Not exactly the environment I enjoy spending my leisure time at.  Again....next!! Too many other places in Las Vegas you can joyfully waste your money at. This is not one of them.",

We sat down and was waited on by a cute brunette/single mother who was polite. I ordered a chicken burrito with sauce.  When the burrito came it had 2 different kind of sauces (one was sort of sweet). Didn't really go with a burrito. The beans in the burrito seemed dried as if they had been sitting for a while.   Overall, I was disappointed. Not traditional Mexican food by any definition of the word.

Any resemblance between a real Mexican restaurant and this place is purely coincidental.  There is very little to recommend in this place.  The food is edible, but just barely.  To add insult, it is amazingly expensive.  The place tries to be cool and hip, but it fails miserably.  It's True about the staff...there is a boredom that seems to pervade everyone there.  A wasted enterprise...this could be a great experience but whoever runs it needs to go back to the drawing board or sell to someone who knows how to run a Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "I've heard countless stories of Senor Frogs in Mexico and I knew not to have the same expectations. The initial reception of Senor Frogs on Yelp has been less than stellar with a little less than 3 stars. Nevertheless, my friend and I still wanted to check out Treasure Island's latest cantina. Senor Frogs is clearly visible off the strip and is the backdrop to the Treasure Island Pirate Show.  The bar/club was relatively slow on the weeknight we visited. We had no problem getting barstools at the main bar. If you turn around, glass walls give you a great view of the Las Vegas Blvd. and the free show. Our server was quick to  bring us their drink menu along with their food menu. We skipped the food since we had just had some appetizers at Margaritaville. Drinks are pricey with an average price of $10 and up.  The drink menu is extensive and my friend had plenty of options. I'm not one for mixed drinks and I stuck to a Long Island with no sweet and sour. The bartender was fast with our drinks and courteous throughout. The bill for two drinks was about $23 not including tax or tip and we were quickly on our way out. However, we did enjoy the servers dancing to the music inside the bar and the pirate show outside.  As we were leaving, we discovered another side of Senor Frogs where it was much more lively. Lots of dancing, lots of balloons, lots of drinking. I'm sure if we had seen this on our way in, we would of stayed a bit longer, but we were ready to head back to our hotel. Senor Frogs isn't bad nor is it great. I'd recommend coming with a group or drinking a bit before coming in and paying their Vegas prices.",

(keep in mind we hadnt been offered a drink of water but he wanted to take a picture lol)- after he leaves we had enough time to look at the menus front and back, decided on what we wanted for drinks and food, still no waitress!!! were like lets just go!! by this time the waitress finally comes over with the worst customer service/attitude ever. we were like, we are just going to go, and she waived bye-bye with her hands ( like get out) !! not sorry for the wait, why is there a problem, again nothing!! - I understand that people have bad days, and if they were at capacity, but half the room was empty!! (not surprised) no excuse for the lack of training, professionalism, the owner/ employers need to monitor the staff a little more closely! The staff seemed a little too comfortable not practicing the proper etiquette- (they all seemed to be bothered or hate their jobs) maybe there is a problem with management when 2 or more employees are unhappy, or maybe its the employees!! Either way, we will never go there again, -we are locals and eat on the strip very often!! (we end up eating at Gilleys).  If you are in the mood for bad attiudes and tacos go to senor frogs they wont disappoint!! - ( good luck)-",

There was a Hispanic female bartender that seemed like she doesn't like her job and she was so nasty to everyone that was waiting.  We all waited on average 20 minutes for her to get our drink and she never made eye contact with any patrons which was weird.  I'd go back for outside reggae area.",

However, I am very happy I did not end up paying for a drink and reading these reviews have validated my choice in not doing so. I got a buy one, get two voucher but the yards you get are some of the most expensive I saw in Vegas. About $28 for one (what gives)?! And they had a policy on the bar that said if you were caught giving your two for one yard to someone else, you'd end up paying the full price. That is messed up to me. The drink choices were also extremely unappealing. However, the environment is fun. I love the free balloons we got and I'd go back just for the atmosphere.",

Anyways...came here on 4/3/16. Their food is very standard for mexican..no, it's not authentic..but they don't advertise authentic Mexican food. Really fun restaurant. Funny decorations. Funny stuff to take pictures with...they can also take pictures for you. Lots of drink deals. 2 big bars..one inside..one outside on a patio terrace that looks out onto the strip. We sat outside and JASON was our bartender. He was really great!! Buy one get one free on their yard drinks. I had a bloody mary. He makes a REALLY good one. My friend had a guava smoothie..no alcohol because she was driving..that was good too..refreshing. You can get anything in the yards..doesn't have to be alcoholic. He was very personable, made sure we were well taken care of, quick, and made great drinks.",

She ordered a burrito, me a chimichanga. Our meals looked great, but as we dug in we both saw it was 95 percent RICE, hardly any meat inside. For $18 apiece, we could of ordered food at Roberto's Taco Shop that is 10 times better. Then we kidded each other about the sides, avocado and rice. More rice. At least the side should of been refried beans so our meals wouldn't be 98% rice. Good place to eat if you're a vegetarian. Than all you have to do is pick out the tiny fragments of meat in the burrito or chimichanga.",

I've been to a few Senor Frog's and they are crazy and wild and fun ... this one wasn't.  Except for a table of drunk guys wearing balloon hats, it was mostly families.  Not a good sign :(  The free appetizer was mini nachos.  It took a while for them to arrive and they were cold.  It's bad enough that they use canned cheese ... cold canned cheese is gross.  They were definitely not worth the price.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga, without sour cream or guacomole.  Though the chicken was good and there was lots of it, there was definitely no cheese mixed in with it.  The Mexican rice inside really overpowered it (especially since there was rice on the side too).  My server, while efficient, was rather cold and abrasive ... not warm and fuzzy at all.  This Senor Frog's was a disappointment and I would suggested you not check it out.",

Second when they took us to our table there was about 5 empty tables!! (Try to make it seem like they're busy, but they're not!! ) Then we looked at the Menu the prices where ridiculous, we got the Carne Asada plate for $29 the food was nasty!!! you can tell the beans were from a can and the chimichanga it comes with, let me just say the ones from Walmart are 100x better!!! My husband and I got an 8oz drink for $11 that tasted like a plain smoothie.   Then, The waiter didn't bother to come not even once to ask if we needed anything, we had to go up to him and ask for our bill. I wish I would of read the reviews before I came here, I would of rather spend double the $$ else where. Do not come and waist your $$ here Vegas has plenty of restaurants!!! I would of rather ate McDonald's. Come on people 400 + reviews with 2 stars!! Haha",

Fresh guacamole that was quite good.  The mimosas truly are unlimited.  I think we went through 6 bottles of champagne.  The drag queens work the aisles.  They saying tipping is compulsory but not everyone did.  However, it does increase the fun to tip as the queens will come to your table more.  It's loud. It's irreverent.

Ordered cheese quesadilla took over fifteen minutes by which time, I got tickets way at back of hotel (Treasure Island), got frozen yogurt with fruit toppings and three types of yogurt paid, got carded walked back to front where mom was still waiting to be served; we ate the yogurt I had brought spoons to share and still no plain cheese quesadilla, but did receive fake pleasantries from receptionist decided to eat after show.  Yogurt would tide us over. So is the food good ?? Who knows???",

The drag performance better be good because the service here SUCKS. I would not recommend wasting your time in Vegas coming to this show unless you want to stand in line for an hour.",

I bought a certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> and decided to take my adult daughter to this restaurant. We decided to order a number of appetizers: chicken quesadillas, nachos and corn on the cob. The chicken quesadilla was orange in color with salty, dark, chicken meat, not the white breast meat served by other restaurants. It tasted like it had been sitting there for a few days. I took the filling out of one piece and was done. The nachos were inedible-totally soggy chips and gross tasting. I complained about how soggy the chips were and they offered to make another one with the sauces on the side. The brought the chips with melted cheese on top and all the sauces such as cheese and beans. The beans were liquid like water which is likely what contributed to the sogginess of the chips. I lifted the top layer and all of the grated cheese underneath was entirely unmelted. When I let the waitress know, she stated \"Oh, that is because they were trying to make it fast for you.\" Um, I think most people would rather have it done right. The corn on the cob was okay, nothing special and definitely not worth $8.50.  I ended up with close to a $30 bill for the worst food ever. I asked for a container to take the food with me. I packed up the top layer of chips with melted cheese, sour cream and guacamole along with the remaining pieces of quesadilla and gave them to a man looking for empty cans on the strip. I work hard for my money and this place definitely was a waste of time. AVOID this place. Even if we had been totally drunk, the food would have tasted just as nasty.",

However, I think it is enough said about the basic food and the pricey drinks they offer. And if you are drunk enough you might not see the reality.  What really concerns me and that changed somewhat fast over the last 3 years - is the cleanliness of this place..!? Everything is sticky and dirty- the chairs the table just everything- better keep your hands sanitized before eating!  On top of this, they have pigeons running and flying in there at the bar area. Funny and sad at the same time; they do have a sign up saying 'do not feed the birds they bring bacteria'!?!? Well if you know that already why don't you take care of it!? If they would have a net or a few metal lines over the one small opening they have, the flying rats could not come in at all. And yes pigeons are called flying rats for a good reason- they do bring bacteria!  Really sorry to see that place going south.. it wouldn't take much to brush it up - someone probably should just collect a few times the $30 for a salad and beer and re-invest and clean and renovate.. not all visitors/ tourist are drunk blind or stupid !",

ABOUT THE SHOW  Think back to the day when you visited a gay bar and drag queens would work the club for tips. That's this show in a nutshell. The costumes and makeup are both done well. Just keep in mind that a good part of the \"show\" is viewed on the big screens while the drag performers work the room. Also so disappointed that some of the performers didn't even make an effort to learn the words or lip-sync. Momma Rue would not be happy.    Word to the wise, buy general admissions, bring your patience, and low expectations. And, if you drink, indulge!!!! You'll need it to get through this show. Those of you that know good drag will be so disappointed with the show. Those of you that have no idea what good drag is all about, have at it!",

Lastly the beef fajitas my wife ordered were void of any seasoning and the thing strips of meat looked like they were cut with a meat slicer. The margaritas were small, over priced and made with the cheapest alcohol. Steer clear of this place, you will get better Mexican at taco bell",

I had a blast at the show.  It was hard getting to the venue by transportation, since you literally have to walk the whole square all around to get there 20 mins walk in addition to taking the bus. The show started late. The lineup inside of the Treasure island casino was long as was the wait. We had good seats-with bottles of champagne waiting for us at our table-we went through 3 bottles as drinks were included part of the package. The quality of the buffet was average -it had an array of brunch items-the pancakes and bacon were my favourites. Once we settled down with food the show started. It was around an hour long-the drag Queens would perform and then walk around for tip. They were great! So come prepared with small bills, however Chelsea was available to break bills to smaller ones on site.   This was definitely one of my favourite shows of my trip! I wish I got to purchase the brunch with bitches tank top though!",

They had bottles of champagne and orange juice so you could mix your own drink and load up the alcohol. Everyone was very very drunk by the end. The food was average to bad. I think you're really paying for the show and the drinks. Enjoy!",

If they had no other performers or equal time the show would be a hundred times better. We may not pay the same to get in in but we like to tip. Thanks from the left side",

My sister turned 21 so we took her here Saturday night since the vibe is always good. My boyfriend and I spent about 200 on drinks overall. During one of my trips I asked the bartender for a cup of water. He said they didn't have any only bottled for $5. Weird, no fountain water. Ok. So downstairs I made another trip to the bar and again asked that bartender. She said no. Didn't even give me the bottled water option. Rude. I asked the one next to her if I can PAY for water. She said yes $5 and brought me the smallest water bottle. I asked if I can have a cup of water with ice as the lady next to me had one she NODDED no and handed me the bottled water. What in the world. It's a little upsetting that they don't offer water to those who are drinking and trying to sober up.",

Very loud.  I couldn't even talk to my husband who was sitting next to me.  We had to ask our server multiple times to repeat herself.  2.  The free shots.  I don't drink alcohol for personal beliefs and a spotlight was put on me despite the fact that I did not have a napkin flying above my head.  The guy came over and I had to cover my mouth and say no.  He did not want to take no for an answer.  I had to repeat myself 3 times before he left me alone.  3. I did not receive a balloon hat.  I may not drink, but I understand silliness.  I work with children. . .  4.  No Id's were checked.  Their were children in the dining area and alcohol freely being given.  I noticed an older woman looked very angry that the free alcohol guy was trying to give a shot to a younger girl at the table.    5.  Food was not great.  I got pasta and it seemed more like soup.  Way too much sauce for anyone.  Afterwards, my husband and I agreed that we would not go there again.  We have had wonderful  experiences at other bars and restaurants and we will not go back to Senor Frog's.",

I don't care if there are or are not any dram shop acts in Las Vegas, but you cannot deny water to people you've been serving alcohol to.  Especially when I know for a fact, and I have proof, that they were serving 19 year olds alcohol. Of course \"Paco\" who was extremely rude tried to deny alcohol and charge for it was completely out of line.  A bartender should NEVER be required to ask for permission to serve water to a customer no matter what the circumstances are.",

Twice, I had to get up to find my server so I could order drinks & both times she seemed like she was bothered. (Do your job girl, then your customers won't have to). I am usually not a tough critic when it comes to resteraunts, or service but senior frogs deserves ZERO stars.

A new escape from the beaches of Mexico. The venue  is split in to two different venues with two different entrances and admissions $20 guys and $10 girls the venue is decently design. The sound system is average not up to par for a venue in Las Vegas the crowd is a mixture something you would find if your in college  and on spring break. The music was decent  but that shows when the headlining  Dj's are Pepito & Pepe. There ok but the musical selection was to predictable.   It doesn't make sense to charge double for  one venue,   Room 1 Top-40/HipHop  Room 2 Latin Music.   Its cheap for those not looking to have an Epic time. How ever those who come to Vegas don't want to have anything less then an amazing time. There are other venues that will blow you away and Senor Frogs just isn't one of them.",

I wish we would have saved our money and gone elsewhere but in the name of being festive, we went anyways. I've been to Senor Frogs in Cancun when I was in college and it was a little too tacky and rambunctious for me then and much hasn't changed since then.   We sat out on the patio hoping to enjoy some food and drinks and we did but everything took forever and their prices for what they're serving are completely asinine. I got a chicken burrito that was swimming in different types of salsa, one of which smelled like curry and made me want to throw up. There was no taste whatsoever and I could barely choke down 1/3 of it. The drinks weren't much better either but at least I could taste the hooch in them. If you're going for drinks it's a great place (if you got money to burn) and if you want to do a conga line for free shots poured down your throat, again great. Personally when I go out for food and drinks I want to enjoy the full experience, not worry about my feet sticking to the ground due to liquor, sweat, hoochie and broken dreams.Shaking my head just thinking about this place.",

The drinks we got were like jungle juice, so I don't think it was such a good deal, haha. The deal applies to all drinks, so you can get a beer, daiquiri, shots.. whatever your liver desires.  The menu seems like expensive Americanized Mexican food, so we didn't bother. I would come back, but at night and with a buzzy mindset. I'm sure it gets crazy at night, so I would like to come back and check it out.",

    "text": "The only reason the gets 1 star,  is because we got two drinks for the price of one. Which they still make out on, because it was a $40 drink!   We start out by putting our name in, we are told it will be a 15 minute wait. No worries, were in a casino! We can just hit the slots and grab a drink while we wait. 30 minutes go by, and we haven't been texted or called about our table. I decided to check with the hostess, just in the event we missed something. The hostess states she forgot we were waiting, and that she could seat us now. As we walk in we notice there are empty seats all throughout the restaurant. I'm not quite sure why there was a wait to begin with....  Needless to say, we are starving and can't wait to get some stuff to eat! we start with the chips and salsa. And we get two of the souvenir drinks (for the price of one). The chips come out nice and warm, unfortunately the cook forgot to grab from the fresh batch, because they were so stale and lacked flavor. Luckily the salsa packed a small punch so it could sound out the stale chips.  My fiance and her friend shared an order of the chicken fajitas, while I ordered the chicken tacos.  I enjoyed my chicken tacos very much, I felt like the food was cooked perfectly, again except for the fact that the tortillas were also stale. It was very noticeable and concerning, but I was so hungry i didn't make a big deal of it.  By the looks of it, my fiance and her friend also enjoyed their fajitas, but for some reason it didn't come with any sour cream or cheese? And the guacamole wasn't to be touched, it looked like something that sat in a can for about 3 weeks before it was served.  As far as the service goes, I kind of got a \"Dicks last resort\" kind of feel. The waitress wasn't necessarily rude, but she could clearly care less if we were having a good time or if our orders were cooked to order.  We left with that feeling like \"I'm full, but I feel gross, and wish we went somewhere else\".   So with that, I would suggest you dine somewhere else.  There is no reason to go there and get overcharged for subpar food, over priced, watered down drinks, when you can get the same 2 for 1 deal on the strip and get your money's worth.",

We waited and waited and never got notified via text that our table was ready.  The hostess apparently completely forgot about us.  We finished our drinks and left.  Our margaritas were mediocre at best.  Unless you are will to stand around and hope they don't forget you, skip this place.  The service was some of the worse I've ever had, and we have been all over the world.  Can't make any comments about the food, as we never got any.",

Apparently, they have forgotten that one half of the population voted for him, and still support him. So as much as we would have supported the show by buying more merchandise, they have let us know they don't care for us or our money. I say boycott the show until they show respect for the fly over part of the country.  By the way, we pay over $300k a year in federal taxes, so we have lots of disposable income.",

Their food is a little on the pricey and not terrible however there is nothing that would make you say \"I need to come back to get this.\"  While there a family came in with young children and were very offended at the signs that said \"horny\" \"virgin\" etc. and left abruptly. From the time they came in I wondered what about the place said \"child friendly\" to begin with.",

    "text": "This review takes into account the fact that I had a $24 Groupon for $40 worth of food. Otherwise, the meals are WAY too expensive for what you get.   Both of our meals were fairly good. I got the Chicken Quesadilla ($17), which featured actual cheese that was filled all the way to the edges of the tortilla--unlike some places where you're eating JUST tortilla until you get to the middle. The chicken was a little dry, but not enough to ruin the meal.  My fiancee ordered the beef nachos ($19), which came with REAL cheese, instead of nasty cheese-like sauce. These were impressive, considering this was a gimmicky-type of restaurant. By the time she (with my help) got down to the bottom of the plate, there was plenty of cheese and meat leftover. We didn't have to eat a bunch of plain chips with nothing on them. The nachos were also layered with refried beans, which added a nice touch.  Food-wise, the guacamole was the low point. It was way too oniony and relied on that for its taste.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, so you have to give it points for that, but I don't think I'd come back without a Groupon.  The food isn't terrible, but just doesn't live up to the price tag. In fact, I'm not sure anyone's nachos or quesadillas would. If you're going to dine here, make sure you find a deal online, otherwise you're overpaying.",

The carne asada tacos were very dry and the guacamole that came with it was very warm and gross I ended up only eating 2 of the 3 tacos. The only reason I ate the 2 was because I was SO hungry. Guacamole isn't supposed to be warm! The enchiladas my mom got she said tasted bland and also made her sick.   The only good thing about this place was the ambiance, it's fun to look at all the signs on the ceilings and listen to the music.  Bottom line, if you want to drink, this is probably the place for you, the people at the bar looked like they were having a good time, but if you want to eat dinner and have a good meal, look elsewhere!",

    "text": "Introduction:  Since we've never been here, thought we gave it a try, man was it a disappointment.  I am definitely surprised the rating is so high. I mean, there's nothing great I can find to say that's exceptional.  I really try to look for something positive.  Price: 0/5 Generally, I don't care about price if the food and service is good. About $17 for 10 pieces of horrible buffalo wings and about $26 for a horrible mixed chicken & beef fajitas is def expensive.  Service: 1/5 Our server was actually friendly, we don't deal with her much right after she took our order. Except when she bring us our bill. But what makes their service so bad? No Chips, in addition, they nickel & dime you to death. Even charge you for salsa. WTF? I have never came to a Mexican restaurant with no courtesy chips and salsa. Also, took forever to get our salsa and when we finally got it, it tasted horrible.  Quality: 0/5 NO Bueno! The buffalo wings were salty as hell and had a peanut taste to it. Kinda weird, tasted like a Thai Chicken Sate. Just doesn't taste right on buffalo wings. The fajitas was also gross, way too much paprika powder. Tasted like I was sniffing someone's bad armpit the entire time.  Quantity: 3/5 They do give you a lot of food, I am assuming it appears there was a lot because it tasted so crappy, I left a lot behind.  Cleanliness: 3/5 Not immaculate or nothing spectacular, but definitely not dirty, just a Meets standard rating.   Tips: If you still want to try this place out, at least get a Groupon special. Personally, even with the discount, I still don't think it's worth it.",

So disappointed we spent money to see this show. I have been to one before in San Diego that was 100xs more fun!",

    "text": "After a drunk fueled morning Las Vegas style, we needed to grab a bite to eat for lunch. Since we were at the TI casino we decided to grab some nachos and beer at Senor Frogs. We had never been there before so figured nachos aren't that hard to screw up and sounded good for soaking up some booze. They also go great with drinking more booze.   We were seated at our table and was greeted by our waitress 10 minutes later. We ordered our steak nachos and a bucket of beer. We waited for our beer to come out but about 10-15 minutes later the nachos came out. Nachos and no beer does not make me happy. About a minute later the assistant manager (I believe he was) asked us how we liked the nachos. We explained that we just got them but we had still not gotten our beers that we ordered at the start. Less than 5 minutes later we had our beer from that time.  Now on to the nachos. The nachos were just meh. The steak was not very flavorful and could taste that it was cheap meat. The nachos and bucket of beer cost us over $50. Save your money and eat some place else with cheaper but better tasting food.",

Bottomless mimosas are totally bottomless and had a solid amount if champagne rather than how some places take forever to refill and skimp. The show was so fun, chanel (the hostess) was delightful.

    "text": "So, we bought the Groupon for the brunch drag-show.  Which, in reality, is a pretty good deal.  I think it was 2 people for $50.  This included all your drinks, buffet, and the show.  1.  Seating was assigned, and you were not smashed together.  We had a table near the stage, smack in the middle.  Good location, but right next to a speaker. 2.  Food was a brunch buffet.  A mix of breakfast items, and Mexican food.  It was just average, maybe a bit below.  Nothing special.  It was easy to get to, never a long line, and they didn't run out of anything.  You could go up as much as you wanted. 3.  Drinks.  Each table had 2 bottles of champagne and a picture of oj.  There was no waitress, so for any other drinks, you had to get up and go to the bar.  They were included, but you had to get them yourself.  They did have top shelf liquor at the bar though. 4.  The show.  It was decent.   These were not the best, nor the 2nd best, nor 3rd best, drag queens that I've seen.  It is like watching a movie that went straight to video.    Overall, entertaining and a good value with the groupon.  You were there for 3 hours and could have easily got your monies worth in liquor alone.",

We expected it to be about $20, which would cover the cost of about 2 drinks. This wasn't a rip-off because of the price though; it was a ripoff because they basically serve you water in a tall, pretty container FULL of ice. You're really getting AJ 8oz drink! DON'T DO IT!!!!

Not something that I would expect in the service industry in a \"hostess\" position...or from a supposedly \"up-beat\" place like Senor Frogs....or on a Sunday afternoon at the beginning of your shift......................... She really killed the whole experience and am no longer a fan.............one bad apple...",

    "text": "We came here for dinner last night, but my hubby and I were disappointed.  I knew that this place would be loud, and it was.  It was fun seeing people going on stage doing Karaoke and dancing, but the food was less to be desired.  There wasn't a huge selection on the menu, and many of the \"Mexican\" dishes did not include rice & beans.  Even the chips and salsa were extra! (and the chips came served in a bag)  The server seemed to push their tall glasses of margaritas, but we could not drink that much, so we paid for a smaller margarita.  The salsa was delicious, but my cheese enchiladas were less to be desired.  I did not like their red sauce.  There was a nice lady walking around making balloon hats for everyone.   All 4 of us in our group had her make us one, and we tipped her for making them.  We wore the hats while we were in the restaurant.   When we put our bank cards in the holder for our bills to be split, the server walked by very fast & grabbed it, before we could tell him we want the bill split.  Luckily, he figured it out and split the bill for us.   I don't plan to return here.  I prefer Margaritaville or Cabo Wabo's food.",

Big frog grabbed my attention so we went for it. service was slow and restaurant wasn't that busy so dont know why it took 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Finally ordered drinks and food. After waiting 15 minutes to order it took another 15 minutes just for our drinks to arrive because they decided to call up our server on stage to do some dances? Really? But anyways..finally got our Drinks and yes they were WAY overpriced for the amount of alcohol in em. And as for the Food it was gross,tasteless and left my stomach feeling not so great. In the end friends were upset i had chosen this lovely establishment.. and to top it off i just found out that they are the reason for the tequila bar ISLA closing down. So That upset me, but really its only a matter of time before something else is set to replace senor frog.  WONT BE BACK!",

I'd say close to an hour. I understand it was busy, but things were a bit chaotic it seemed. When it finally came out they were a bit soggy and we had to use forks to eat them. It made me wonder how long they sat waiting to be delivered to our table. We expected better from a $16 nacho.  The service here was slow. Our table didn't have a server so we had to go directly to the bar. On a busy Sunday there was only 1 bartender so it took a while to get a drink.",

The nacho's were horrible. The chicken was extremely dry and only received a spoonful of avocado and sour cream. My kids barely ate their food. The kids chicken  taquito was awful. It didn't even taste like chicken. The chicken wings were horrible. The only thing going on for this restaurant is the atmosphere. People were drunk and having a good time to the DJ's super loud music. We waited a long time to be seated and should have skipped this restaurant. The wait staff looked stressed out and understaffed. It's unfortunately not a wheel chair friendly place. We will not be going back anytime soon. We easily spent $100.00 for 5 of us and all disliked the food. They need a new cook.",

It's really not a place that you would want to purchase anything. Also, it smells weird in some areas; I thought it was vomit, but it was just really gross.   The one, ONLY thing that this place is good for is for dancing and listening to music. Latin nights. They are just a whole lot of fun. It's super crowded, with crazy music, and even crazier dancing. Everyone here needs to be careful, the crowd is really touchy-feely because they want to dance on you. If you're not into that sort of thing, then this really isn't the spot you want to hang out at!   The one thing that I thought was kinda cool was the comic book-esque sayings that were plastered on the ceiling. I'll come back if someone brings me there, but only to dance. But definitely have a drink somewhere else, because you shouldn't be ordering here.",

We were told there was a 30-45 minute wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar, so we took the bar. However, we soon saw lots of empty tables everywhere. So we asked to be moved, and the host was hesitant to move us, because we already ordered items at the bar and apparently it's hard to move you to the \"restaurant\" in the system ... We were able to move after some pleading... Which seemed pretty silly. The host had an attitude about it, which put us off.  We noticed lots of empty tables in our new spot, so we are thinking they tell you there is a wait, so people think oh this is the spot to be, let's put our name down on the waiting list ... or the waiters are lazy or something.  Back to the food .. think upscale Taco Bell. We weren't impressed. Our appetizer was like $18 and our Carne Asada was $29... I mean damn. And it wasn't spectacular.  We didn't even get drinks, cause I'm sure those were like $20 a pop, so we decided to go elese where to indulge.  The entertainment was cool though, we went on Saturday around 7pm and they had pop trivia going, a men's dancing contest ... and top 40 hits from a live DJ. Women's contest was going to begin at 8pm then the club portion begins at 12am according to the MC.",

We came in after a little wait which is to be expected, we were showed to our table which was still dirty, after it being cleaned we waited for our server for 20 mins we should have left but we had a coupon for drinks.   Our sever Emmanuelle gave the drinks to wrong table, after noticing and people placing straws in the drinks he takes them off the table and gives them to us. Gross!!!We asked for new drinks, and he got upset. Our food was cold, and our sever never checked on us. When we tried to get his attention he told us we had to wait. We were the only table that didn't get balloons, when we mentioned it we were told we can get the ones behind the table.    What!! I get that it's popular but what about customer service?? This place has absolutely none, the manager should take a good look at their management skills, and the team they have under them. I would never go to this location again.",

Honestly though, the environment is really energetic and loud so don't expect to actually talk to anyone you are eating with. The fish and chips are good, food wise. Oh, and you can take goofy pictures, so that's fun.  Hint: if you walk in somewhere and they ask if you are there to drink or to eat, never eat the food. Unless you love globs and globs of cheese. The rubbery, oily kind.   Cons: Literally the WORST meal that I have ever paid for. Had to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was awful. How do you mess up salsa in a Mexican restaurant? My partner ordered tacos. Only ate two bites of one taco because they were gross. Again, how do you mess up tacos in a Mexican restaurant?    I'm not too surprised because I should have known better. I mean, it's Vegas and I got a coupon for a free appetizer. There had to be a catch. Stick to the buffets, people. Your wallets and stomach will thank you.",

What could be so bad?  20 minute wait for a table at 3pm, 15 minute wait to see our server, another 10-15 minute wait for our drinks (coke and iced tea), then another 20 minute wait for our appetizer after we got our drinks. By the time all was said and done, it took about an hour from the time we reached their front doors (STARVING) to actually get our hands on some food -- and they don't serve chips and salsa while you wait (wth?).   On top of the long wait, their food was supremely subpar. Their iced tea was watery and didn't come with any lemons (or sugar for that matter... our table was void of any sugar what-so-ever and it took another 5 minutes to flag down another waiter to get some for us). The nachos we ordered were the only edible item we got. Their tack salad was sadly pathetic with wilted iceberg lettuce, canned kidney beans and weird tasting guacamole. By the time our fajitas came, we were so turned off by the lack of service,  loud music, annoying DJ, and sad looking food and beverages that we decided to just pack it up and leave --- which took another 15 minutes to get our waiter for the check. No Groupon is worth that suffering. Maybe I'll come back again in the (far) future for drinks -- at least the loud, obnoxious music will be drowned out by the sweet taste of hard liquor.",

My wife never received a refill on her soda, there was never a checkback on our meal, and when we sent our appetizer back because it came after the meals were delivered we were shunned upon.  We watched one table get up completely after waiting twenty minutes to be served, another group next to our table had to go to the bar to order their drinks, and it just went downhill from there.  Never in my life have I had such horrible service that I tipped zero, but for this meal I did.  When I went to leave I asked for the manager, the girl said he is over there, and then I had to hunt him down.  When I explained to him, there was absolutely no apology, and the manager just asked who our server was.    The only bright side of the visit were the tacos which were amazing.",

I was worried there was a catch to this coupon, but to my surprise, there was none :) We ordered 2 Jameson on the rocks for only $10! What a steal :D I believe the amount of alcohol poured was very fair (I HATE when it's 90% ice 10% alcohol).  This place is C-C-CRAZYYYY. Everyone is drunk and getting their groove on. It's actually quite fun to just watch while sippin' on drinks. I saw a few tables dining in, but I think I'll pass on food served here. It's VEGAS! There are so many other appetizing places to eat.  It's super dark in here. That's how you know it's going to be crackinn' ;) Fast service, but nothing spectacular.  Tip: Gather a bunch of friends to grab a few drinks here before going to bigger and better things. This place will light the party fire in you, no doubt.  On a side note: everyone that works here is good looking :X both males and females!",

The beautiful cast members from the RuPaul Drag Race put on an amazingly funny risque lip sync show with amazing hair makeup and costumes. From the emcee who made fun of all of us, to Coco Montrese's amazing Tina Turner,  And impressions of Cher and more we were entertained from start to finish. Buffet was fresh and good and mimosas were truly bottomless with bottles on the table!",

We were kicked out of the club and when I asked the security guard why? He said  because I said so. After talking to the security for 2 more minutes he decided to walk up closer to me and sneak push me out down a slope towards the back entrance of the club. As a result, I rolled out of the club. After that I asked for his name and a manager because I wanted to file a formal complaint. The manager who said her name was just the letter \"G\" said I could not do so with her. When I asked what the name of the security guard was they said he name was \"J\". Really? Thanks for taking care of your customers and being accountable for your actions. Terribly disappointing to have to endure being assaulted on your vacation with a club having zero accountability.",

Maybe because I'm from LA and there is a plethora of Mexican restaurants there, but I found the prices for the quality of food to be a total disconnect. The food was wanting of flavor or flare it's very generic and uninspiring.  Then Treasure Island lures you in with a two for one entree coupon but that's only for one entree per table no matter how many people come in or how much money you spend. And the price of a margarita served in a plastic cup is outrages.  Take a look at the image on the menu versus the actual product I got for the burrito bowl A big discrepancy. With Overall price, quality, deceptiveness they only get one star.",

Everyone ordered the all you can eat tacos and every round, you get a shot lol! Pretty sweet deal for I think $30? It's the house tequila they serve I believe. The shrimp tacos were the hit for them. I ordered chicken wings and nachos. The chicken wings were crispy and tasted like crispy pork skin chips. Decent size wings and juicy. The nachos were ok. I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't what I expected it to be. The cheese was just baked on and not stringy or gooey. The waitress could have told us that the kitchen closed at 10pm when we started ordering. They only had their first round of tacos then she came out with the \"10 minute\" notice that it's closing so put in the orders now. She came back with more tacos and shots but wish we didn't feel so rushed. I guess the bar is the only thing that remains open all night long. We want to come back during the weekend one day. So I'll update the review again.. my unexcited post but cheers my fellow Yelpers!",

    "text": "The saga of the 3-4  hour meal.  Our waiter (Jameson) steps up to the table and does not speak, just stares at us.   \"Hi?\" We ask tentatively after 30 seconds or so. \"Water\" He grunts.   We don't know if he is offering it or requesting it but we say \"Yes! Please!\" hoping it is an offer because it is HOT out on that patio we are sitting on even though the hostess who had talked us into sitting out there claimed it was cool, and we have already been waiting 15 minutes for a waiter to appear.  Jameson turns and walks away.  10 or 15 minutes later he returns with cups of water and again just leaves.  Another 15 minutes later and he comes back to stare at us.  We had been laughing and debating on whether or not he even  is our waiter, and I ask if we can get a pitcher of water because we have all drank our little cups and sucked down every sliver of ice.  He does not acknowledge the request and only says \"Order.\" and then \"No Fettuccine Alfredo.\".  We place our order and I again ask for a lot more water which goes unacknowledged but 10 minutes later he comes and grabs a pitcher from the pile of dirty dishes in the corner and a bit after that appears with a pitcher of ice water.  It looked and smelled clean so I am hopeful that he washed it.   30 minutes later he comes out again.  By this point the patio is completely deserted except for our table, the couple of other guests who had been there are long gone.  At some point the music has come on so loud we cant even speak to the person next to us.   We ask for the ice tea my friend had ordered and for more water and he just  smirks but does grab the pitcher and eventually dropped the tea off at the table. We asked about the chips and Salsa that come with our meal but he acts like he did not hear us. He didn't leave any sugar but ay some point someone came in to clear the dirty dishes and that guy kindly brought over some sweeteners.   An hour after we ordered he comes to me and screams in my ear (because its so loud) that if we want fresh taco salads it will take 20 minutes to make. Is that OK? I was shocked to discover that he could speak more than one word at a time and I said that 20 minutes was fine because we do want fresh salads but that if we could get our chips and salsa that come with our meal  now that would be great. He said chips and salsa don't come with our meal but we showed him the menu and that it does.  The chips and salsa (2 orders even though there were 4 of us and it was supposed to come with each meal) arrived after about 25 minutes.  We begged again for more water and finally got that too (It was SO hot on the patio)    THEN IT GOT WEIRD. Finally our Enchilada, Fish Tacos and 2 Taco Salads arrived.  AND 4 plates of Fettuccine Alfredo.  He doesn't say a word, just drags another table over next to our table and motions for one of us to go sit at it.  We say we didn't order Pasta, he says we did.  I start laughing so hard I think I am going to pee my pants, are we on a Reality Show????  We eat and we all agree that the chicken in our food is AMAZING and I begin to wish the service was not SO Awful. I take a tiny bite of rice and it is SUPER hard.  Either uncooked, or cooked many many hours ago, so gross.  We eat and 20 minutes after we are done we find Jameson again, he comes to clear the plates and we ask for the dessert that comes with our meal.   No he says.   The Kitchen is Closed.   Then he walks away.",

I was just coming off a 4-hour plane ride and was famished due to poor planning on my part not bringing snacks. After getting settled in, we had a quick bite to eat here. I ordered the chicken tacos. We were first served chips and salsa which the chips were ok, but the salsa was canned most definitely and they threw in some cilantro to make it \"authentic\". My tacos arrived and I took one bite - zero flavor. Lots of chicken, but NO flavor. It came with guac, sour cream and salsa, cheese was smothered on the chicken but it was so gross! The best way I can describe it was that it tasted microwaved. And of course it was like $30 for the meal, because - Vegas.  Hard pass. Never again.",

Although it was far from a full house in the restaurant we had a MC up there like hyping it up like it was packed.  The waiters sang a Backstreet Boys song and opened up the karaoke for anyone else.  They would leave signs behind patrons, like \"single and looking\" or \"kiss me.\"  Just anything they could do to create a laid back, party atmosphere.  But the food.  Ehhhh.  Best thing about the meal were the chips and salsa.  Luckily we got there right before happy hour so we ordered 3 appetizers that came out to 17 bucks.  I got burger sliders and the buns for all of them were SO stale.  I'm normally on a pretty strict diet so to have a \"cheat meal\" and not enjoy it is mildly devastating.  I won't be coming here again.",

Of course, we all get up and do our ridiculous shimmy and low and behold when it's all done NOBODY GETS FREE SHOTS as promised. WTF am I asked to dance for if I'm not getting a shot for free like promised? Joke.  #4, The food was overpriced and not that good. The chips were terrible and the salsa wasn't much better. The blackened chicken burger was OKAY but certainly not worth the $18 they charge for it. The sweet potato fries were cold and overcooked.  #5, It took FOREVER to hunt down the waitress to come give me the check and then another lifetime for her to come back and run my card so I could get the hell out of there before the next shimmy-fest started.

Even under those circumstances, if I could take it back I would.  For starters, no outside drinks.  We had purchased a daiquiri at a bar upstairs just 5 minutes before in the same hotel and had to chug it to get in.  Why the hell can't I take a drink inside that I purchased in the SAME HOTEL as the restaurant?!?!?  Oh I know so I can spend more money at your restaurant!!!  Then the food was very expensive and fairly mediocre.  $17 for an average burger and fries? methinks not.  After chugging our daiquiri and having a pretty good buzz going you'd think the food would taste better.  On top of that the service was just horrible.  Pretty much as long as you're not drinking you don't exist.  I understand that I'm not getting drunk and spending a ridiculous amount of money in your restaurant but I am still a customer.  There was a table right next to us that was drinking and the waiter pretty much never left their side.  The few times the waiter wasn't there a hostess was there or some random chick making balloon hats who stood there awkwardly waiting for a tip.  Senor Frog's is clearly just out to get your money so swim clear of this place, unless you plan on getting hammered then by all means the entire staff will be at your feet.  ALL I WANTED WAS A BALLOON HAT!!! :(  P.S. my wife and I had an upset stomach for the next couple hours",

Portions are small and expensive even by Vegas standards.   It was not very good Mexican food and I left still hungry.  Service was adequate but again by Vegas standards very sub-par.  The server would take our order then walk back and talk to 3 other servers for 20 min.  I was not really annoyed by it, but just sort of amazed given my other experiences at strip restaurants.  We all left with some regrets about wasting a vacation meal here.   Glad I tried it once because I was curious but I will never go back. Way too many other fun places in Vegas with good food to try! If you are in Las Vegas for a limited time, I would advise you to try another place.  There just seems to be nothing special about this place other than overlooking the pirate show at night.",

Service was okay, but took a while to get our check. The prices were outrageous, and the free \"shots\" were only mixers with no alcohol. The Yard is priced at $24 BUT it's almost the same size as the $10 drink which the only difference is you get to keep the cup. Would I go there again? Probably not, the only thing I would do is go there to watch the Sirens show when its going on from the patio. I was sadly disappointed as it was my 30th birthday. And I have to say that both the Senor's I been to in Mexico (Mazatlan) and Ensenada and this was nothing close to either one of those...  I did not have any food, so I can't review that. Save yourself the cash and go somewhere else... And I have to add the drinks were just okay. My friend got one drink that tasted like it had too much syrup in it.",

You pay $5.00 for chips and salsa.  We had two house margaritas, an appetizer of nachos and one of quesadillas.  Our bill was $60.  Would not have been so bad if the food was good.  The food was so bad we should have sent it back.  The guacamole tasted like it had been frozen.  You do get lots of sour cream.  Unfortunately the sour cream was the best part.  The nachos and quesadilla were both very dry and the cheese was hard.    The atmosphere was fun.  If you want to just go in and drink, then I recommend Senior Frogs.",

Drinks were okay nothing special but fun anyway. Out waitress was kind and our food was good, again nothing special but they did have buy one get one 50% off for football specials so that was awesome. Price wise it definitely was a good pick for a quick early dinner!:)",

Wasn't great at all then decided to go through the other side which had more of a crowd better music and some reggae songs were played too. So my question is why do you charge a cover on the side that plays reggae? The music or dj's not worth the cover charge. Then you go to the other side and there is no charge and it's pretty good. Also a good tip they will let you in free into reggae side if you go through other ; )  My friends and I are from out of town and wanted to listen to Reggae. We ended up leaving this crap hole that says they play reggae and ended up off the strip to a real club. That review will follow in my yelp :) thanks but no thanks Senor Frogs. Maybe you should just open it up and let the dj's from other side go to the reggae side and you will make money.  Besos, Villarreal",

They said they were trying to block out that group on for two weeks, but it just had been post one week earlier. So we had to pay all that money for two lousy beers and some pretty generic food. Save your money, their are a lot better places on the strip, with much better food, that is reasonably priced.",

    "text": "This place sucked. I hate giving bad reviews, and more often than not if I don't want to leave a nice review I leave nothing at all unless I'm pissed off, but this place just was really bad. Unlike a couple of other reviewers' experience, our service wasn't bad at all, in fact that was probably the best part of the whole experience.   The real problems: 1. No drink less than $11...and then the drinks weren't even good. They were small, weak and not even delicious. I had a \"spicy mango margarita\" and it tasted like a regular, non-spicy strawberry margarita (and looked like one too). Not a hint of spice and if that was mango, then I don't know what strawberry is. I was sooo looking forward to that drink too but it wasn't very good, and so expensive I wasn't about to order a different one to see if it was better. Plus it annoys me (especially when you're paying that kind of price) when restaurants/bars serve you drinks in a plastic cup. Really??? I'm paying $11 a drink and you can't even give me a glass?? (We weren't even sitting outside. No excuses.) 2. The food sucked...not good. Bland, greasy, dry chicken, no real flavor.  We knew when we went there not to have high expectations (especially for the food) but it was worse than expected, and the drinks weren't good. Our stomachs hurt afterward. Never ever going back.",

    "text": "My Bad! I picked the place for dinner tonight with some coworkers. I checked yelp found a well reviewed Mexican place that looked great. When we got to where this restaurant was supposed to be (in TI) we found it closed. Senor Frog's was across the casino so we thought we would give it a try. Placed seemed nice enough so we went in, no wait! Sat down at a nice table and waited. Finally a server arrived (maybe 15 min and the place was sloooow). He took our drink order. Margaritas seemed to be their thing, they are not cheap. Looking around there were a few groups looked like possibly a B-day party.. Yep the singing begins; DJ starts and calls all servers to the center of the restaurant. (let's not forget I'm waiting for my $9 margarita)They sing HB loudly. Oops another round for another table. Singing over drink delivered. Served in plastic mug filled with ice. Taste was fine but $9 gets you a maybe 20 oz mug packed hard with ice. Drink was maybe 10 oz. Ordered food and another drink, app Guacamole for the bag of chips we got. Guacamole was poor and obviously from a can. Had fajitas chicken and steak, they didn't suck but smaller than expected. In a nutshell the food didn't suck but was a little overpriced. Drinks good but overpriced. I would expect more. Here's my real problem and the 1 star rating. In an effort to make \"fun\" they have a DJ who plays loud music or portions of music making it impossible to talk during dinner. Worse yet they want to involve the servers 'in his little games.  \"All servers to the front\" shit now I need to wait for my drink while my server is; Singing, doing the electric slide (or some other goofy line dance) and it's going on continually. Hey hire entertainers for the dance and let the server bring my drinks and food. Ihe faster you bring them the more I have. They also have a person making balloon hats for the guests. All that was missing was Chuck e cheese? Is this a place for Kids? In addition they are constantly moving around giant signs with different sayings among the guests, can you say Dick's last resort? They seem to be struggling with an identity crises, are we catering to children or adults.     Wont be back",

I had to stop her to say \"please don't try to give me another one, I just want water!\" Meanwhile, my friend had ordered a Pepsi and didn't receive it until after we got our food, even though she mentioned it to 3 of the wait staff.   Our food was good, but it was not a complete meal! We ended up going somewhere else right afterwards for more food. I ended up paying $18 for my meal and all I got were 3 tacos (very good, but unsatisfying!) Even for the strip this meal was expensive for what we got! I could have gone to Taco Bell and gotten 3 tacos for less than $3. But wait, I would have missed the Emcee walking around trying to get tourists to take shots, which I'm pretty sure no one over the course of the 40 minutes I was there did. You are right Senor Frogs, I'm so glad I paid a $15 markup to hear a pathetic Emcee attempt to rile the crowds into drinking...",

No it's not a fancy place to party, but its a good place to let loose and not worry about dress shoes and $50 cover.

The service started out great! We ordered a spinach dip for an app and it was the highlight of the meal. We had some tortilla soup that was just average and some chicken chimichangas that were also average. I don't like spice and they were served on top of a hot green sauce. It was my mistake for not realizing it had a spicy sauce on it but our server was no where to be found after the entrees were served. There were lots of people filling water at tables which was great, but no one to get another round of cocktails. I understand needing to take a quick smoke or lunch break, but have someone keep an eye on the tables.

They hand out these coupons on the strip buy one drink and get another for free so we come in for happy hour expecting a good deal.   What they do not tell you is that these \"drinks\" are HUGE and literally cost  20.00 to 28.00 a piece.   For two of us just an appetizer and two drink orders a piece @ 2/1 on coupon our bill came out to over $100.00.   We of course tipped the waiter 20.00 but other guests were not tipping at all due to the rip off scheme they have going there.   We really felt taken advantage of and we felt like they prey on the tourists.  We did not take that out on the wait staff but after quiet inquiries we were told this happens a lot where guests complain to the staff there.   We will never go there again and we have friends that frequent vegas and neither will they and they are also writing their reviews.  We were with a rather large group when we went down for my birthday just recently.  We have relatives that live there and we should have asked where to go or looked on yelp.  After looking at how many stars this place has its no big surprise.   If I could give it a 0 I really would and that just PAINS me having worked in this industry years ago.   The entertainment was good but after seeing the bill I was seeing red too much to be in too much of a good mood even after the drinks and the entertainment.   The owners should really be ashamed for preying on people like this.   I am sure though with the size of their pocket books they don't care much.   Its no wonder they have to hand out coupons and scam people to get people in there.   I am SURE they have zero repeat business at this place.",

We actually got all our yard drinks on the house AND the girl in our group was pregnant so she just asked for a water and they gave it to her in a yard cup so she wouldn't feel left out! And I see others have complained that those drinks were weak but maybe we got a special hookup because mine tasted pretty strong.  The cups also have dare dice in the bottom which was a fun addition! The bar itself was dark, crowded, and full o' drunks which is to be expected.   One guy tried to give the bachelorette a high five but her hands were full so he kissed her elbow.",

We went inside and the restaurant was busy and because there was an hour long wait to get a table we decided to grab a table outside near the bar, but also so we could watch the show. When sitting, I went to the bar and grabbed menus to take to the table. I did not expect table service as I was in the bar area and planed to pick up food/drink at the bar and take to the table. Our bartender was BENHAM and he was awesome. Once he noticed what I was doing, Without asking he came from around the bar and came to the table not only to take our order but also to bring our food and check up on us through our meal. AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. Benham was helpful, friendly and funny - the service we received was exceptional. Rarely do you make a personal connection when visiting an establishment for the first however the experience i received not only earned my respect but also established my loyalty. We came for a good time and got exactly that. I will return the next time I am in Vegas, and I have been back since.",

I asked for water, right away cuz I'd been walking in 104 degree temperatures, but had to wait quite a while for it to arrive. Guess the waiter had to run to the pump?  16 oz margarita, which supposedly has 2 shot of tequila in it, was watery and warm.  Got the beef tacos, which gave my jaw a pretty good workout. The beef chunks were tough, and tasted like they only threw some Lawry's Taco Seasoning on.  SO disappointed!  Bill was $30 - one person - one margarita - three tacos!  Damn water is expensive!",

It might be owned by the same corporate group, but this one has nothing in common with the Senior Frog's of Mexico. Entertainment, if you can call it that is 80's and 90's hits with quality of the college dorm. Food is lousy at best and overpriced even by the Strip standards. A burrito for $18 has a quality of roadside gas station and unfriendly, stonewall faces of servers will not help either. Location on the strip at TI behind the closed pirate ship, collecting dust is the only thing Senior Frog has going for it",

There was even a conga line and who can say no to a conga line that involves free shots?  Fair warning though, they pour it directly in your mouth and I'm pretty sure it's more juice than booze.  I don't recommend going here on a Saturday night however, it is ridiculously dead.  My favorite part though were the signs.  They have hilarious signs posted, literally, all over the bar saying things like: \"Kinky is using the feather; perverted is using the whole chicken\" and \"looking for a meaningful, one night relationship.\"   It kind of reminded me of home how laid back it was.

I am giving it 4 stars for the entertainment and staff.  our servers were great & after dinner moved us closer to the stage so we could access the dance floor easier.

If only it wasn't so expensive even w/ our groupon ( we ended up spending over $200!!) it would have been a perfect night... well, the food would still only get at the most 3 stars tho... but 2 adults & 3 teens had a blast dancing & laughing for hours!

Senor Frogs fit the bill pretty well. Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out \"I'm too Sexy\" or a Spice Girl song. Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either. Sadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room! I WOULD go back, but not during karaoke!",

We ask the bartender if they wouldn't mind adding some tequila and they did.  Finally, the food comes out. The beans look like they have been sitting 15 minutes. The temperature confirms this. The middle enchilada was still warm because his buddies insulated him. So we had that going for us!  Steer clear. This place has bad reviews for a reason.",

I had went to senor frogs for a friends birthday and it just so happened to be industry night, which gave my group of friends more reason to go to this spot to celebrate. When we first arrived and seated after making our reservation at 9;30pm, the waitress informs us the kitchen it closing in ten minutes, basically rushing us to make our food orders. I opted out of ordering any food and ordered a mojito.  When my mojito arrived it was in a tiny plastic cup. I've lived in Vegas for 5 years now and I understand the change of prices compared to local spots and the strip. But I would expect I'd get half of what I was paying for a 12$ drink. There was definitely more mint than drink in my cup that's for sure. I could prepare a better mojito than what I was served. It was my one and only drink. And to top it off brought up the reason of us even coming to Senor frogs you were informed by our waitress that they do not honor the industry night discount, something they advertised. I could go on how horrible the service and rude some of the management was but lonnnng story short, I plan on not ever returning. Ruined by friends Birthday and left a real bad taste in my mouth.",

I got married on August 22, 2015 and decided to have our rehearsal dinner the day prior on August 21, 2015. We had been searching and \"tasting\" different restaurants on the strip being that many of wedding party were coming from out of state and we wanted to keep the dinner near their hotels. Our wedding reception was pretty formal, so after many taste testing ventures, we decided we wanted to hold our rehearsal dinner at a venue where everyone could mingle with eachother in a fun comfortable atmosphere.  I remembered that we had taken my son to Senor Frogs for his 21st birthday. I contacted them by email inquiring about special events and I was immediately contacted by Denny. I requested to come into the restaurant after 5:00 PM to view the area of where we could hold our rehearsal dinner and he stated he would make himself available at any time. My husband and I visited that same night and knew the restaurant would be a perfect place for the atmosphere we were wanting!   We held our rehearsal dinner for 30 people on August 21, 2015 and everything was set up as planned with food, tables, chairs, and was even accommodated when I had to add 6 extra people with the very little notice.  We chose to have dinner buffet style non-stop for 2 hours. Denny continuously checked on us to make sure everything was ok and our waitress Veronica (I think that as her name) was very patient with our large group! Thanks a bunch to these 2! :)   The only complaint I have is the heat! lol We sat outside facing the strip, which was a beautiful view but hot, and although they provided misters and fans, we were sweating! August is a very hot month in Vegas, so I had I been a little bit smarter, I would've requested to be seated inside! I'm a local, so I should've known better! lol   Overall, we all had a great time! :)",

Food was good and very reasonably priced especially considering the cost of food everywhere else in Vegas. My friend got the $35 open bar and our server Carlos (who is also the manager) was probably the best service I've ever had at a restaurant and made sure her drink was always refilled, great value for money! I can't drink and so he made sure I was not left out and got me a mocktail in a yard stick which I thought was extremely nice and made me feel better about being surrounded by drunk people lol Overall casual atmosphere but still so fun, we had planned to move onto a club and ended up spending our whole night here! Would definitely return here anytime I'm in Vegas and if you're looking to go out clubbing, definitely start here with their open bar so that you don't spend $44 a drink in the club (seriously, Omnia pricing)",

When we first got to the restaurant we waited a few minutes before somebody came to the front only to tell us the wait was 15 to 20 mins long(even though there were several empty tables) because they had reservations that they were waiting on. After about 12 minutes they texted us that a table was available. We go back inside and there was nobody at the front desk again! I don't know how this was possible when they had just texted us a few seconds earlier. Finally after about 2 mins later  the hostess comes to the front to take us to our seats. They had a very small menu selection so i opted for the chicken taco salad. For $20 I got a tostada full of wilted lettuce and a dry chicken breast and a little bit of guacamole and sour cream. Also it was full of blk olives. I like blk olives but it was overwhelming. I had a mouth full in each bite. My husband got the chicken fajitas and he did not like them. The rice was horrible tasted like it was straight from a box. I would never come back to this place even if they paid me! The only upside it has a nice view of the ships outside and it has pretty humorous inside decor. I would not give any stars if it were up to me.",

I really was not in the mood to argue with the seemingly busy bartender with only couple of patrons at the bar so I'll have to suck it up for not being outspoken about my unfulfilled needs. However, I could've used some loving when it came down to alcohol content.  Ehh ~ Senor Frog ~ con permiso mi amigo pero mucho mucho mucho margarita por favor?",

This place makes Disneyworld look cheap, the most overpriced restaurant in all of Las Vegas.....  $7.00 bud lights? $45.00 Margarita pails? $17.00 chicken sandwich? (average,but good fries with it) $25.00 Fajita's?  Average food at best, my partner only ate part of his rib platter because he did not really like it...($30.00)  I live near this place and understand it's for drunken out of towners who don't care what they are charged on vacation....But it's beyond stupid the prices,it's as bad as the high end nightclubs here.   It is sooo loud you can't even give your waitress the damn order, and the noise never stops.....  Great place for rich, dumb, annoying and loud alcoholics.....Never again for me  Did I mention the all night stomach ache after the chicken sandwich?",

He was awesome. The yard drinks are buy 1 get 1 free, there was three of us so the fourth one our bartender split the drink into thirds so we can all drink it. It was another plus! I don't know about these other bartenders but we ordered a \"Frog Buster\" & AMF, holy strong! We definitely felt it after we finished all of it. The music was amazing! They played everything from Bel Biv Devo to Drake, we were all dancing and having a good time. We did drunkenly make the mistake of paying for the other price shirts. The next day we realized they were $30! Over all the drinks were strong, the music was good & bartenders were friendly. I am definitely coming back next Vegas trip.",

Considering the actual portions is for sharing and the fact that the food is delicious. I recommend the the spicy mango margarita its so good. The reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because when my family and i dine there it was sort of sprinkling and we requested to move but the manager is so stubborn unless its really bad then he could move us.

Pretty cool how it's next to the pirate ships, although the show is discontinued forever :( We tried to get seating outside but it was full and had a wait list going already so we sat inside instead. The inside is pretty chaotic looking, very low lighting with blacklights in the mix. One thing for sure is there is no negative space at all and you always have something interesting to stare at lol. We ordering some sliders and salad and some enchiladas. Sliders sucked for sure, bread was already dense and dry like making the fries the only star of that meal. Luckily I wasnt too hungry and let my mom have most of my food. Our server was pretty cool and I think if it weren't for her we'd probably would have gone up and left. Mainly cause the menu didn't seem all that appealing and the prices were pretty freaking ridiculous.

My guy did notice that bar tender dude has Invisalign (which I currently have and suffer 'major bitch moments' from) so maybe his face just hurt and he was really grumpy.   Either way - we asked for a recommendation on a frozen drink with good tequila and bar tender dude clearly states that frozen drinks are not made with good tequila. Well. Sh*t. Just wanted a rad frozen drink but ok.... You only use trash tequila in frozen drinks. Got it.  Every other interaction with bar tender dude was a bit, well - snooty. Oops, our bad, we were a customer in the establishment that you WORK at. Sorry to inconvenience you.   Eventually we made our way outside to a table, but only to be told we could have a table, yet we could not be 'served' because it was 'just a table'. Guess paying triple the price for food does not warrant table service. Cool.   I guess I can't be to upset because really, what do you expect on the strip besides Bros, jerks and over price everything!",

It's rare that there was almost too much cheese.   Very good spinach dip although not sure why chips are served in a bag.   Decent Caesar. Side salad was only ok load d w too much cheese.   The staff took a 3 star quick junk food meal and made it four stars. A fun evening at Frogs.",

The venue was huge enough to accommodate the attendees and it doesn't feel like it was cramp so that's a big plus. The food serve buffet style. The selections was good, however it was mediocre tasting. Open bar was excellent, however the bartenders seemed overwhelmed and service was slow.",

The bartender and drinks were GREAT. The only issues we had were the seating arrangements. We paid for VIP and we were in a back corner with our backs to the stage. Also, they had this spot light on the performers and it was so bright and directly at us so we could hardly see the stage let alone take pictures. Aside from those things the ladies did great!!!",

Aside from that, wifey and I ordered some chicken nachos and a chicken sandwich to split. The nachos are HUGE, but that's pretty much all they had going for them because the chicken was SO dry. I want to say the chicken sandwich was okay, but I think the fries got cold like within two minutes...   It was their \"happy hour\", which I believe was a BOGO deal on their $33-ish yard drinks at the bar... I would've bought one to split between wifey and I, but apparently sharing the free drink is frowned upon because they'll try and make you pay $40 for the drink if they catch you doing that. Which I think is BS... if I pay for a drink, it's mine and I can share with whomever I want, just like my food also...   Needless to say, it really was just \"A-OK\"and I honestly see no reason to ever come back given that there are so many other solid locations to try...",

Even with getting there early and having reservations. They let the entire VIP LINE go first and o my had 1 guy checking IDs. 2. The food was horrible. Imagine the cheapest food you can get and it was all in a buffet. Fries everything, plain, lack of condiments, and very little healthy items to choose from. Oh and the health stuff was all at the end.   3. The dancers stayed mostly in the VIP section so we did not get to see them much. I had 20 singles and think I gave out 5 4. They took way too much time with people's birthdays and anniversaries.  The best thing I can say is that the main emcee was awesome and nonstop mimosas.  The dances were fun.",

A single domestic beer was over $8, but that's the cost in Vegas for meals and drinks on the the strip. Lol. We were outside and it was really good. The food was delicious, quick and served hot and the music was full of beat. Got asked twice if we wanted our pictures taken with some props from the restaurant. Lol. So be prepared to be harassed in that sense. ;)  However, the second night we ate there, we sat inside. And the music was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think. Couldn't hold a conversation to save our lives. We waited 20 minutes for our food to get to our table, and once it did, the fries and mozzarella sticks were cold. I think our server was somewhere else in her head. The wings weren't as great as the night before either. It's as though they picked the chicken with the smallest amount of meat possible and made sure we got all the runts. I left with a headache. If it was a nightclub (which it does turn into at a certain point in the night), it would be awesome. But it is a restaurant where you eat food for crying out loud. Lol. Not going there again and sitting inside. Nope.",

It's simply fattening, fried, bland food.   2. Seating for \"VIP\" - they seated my party of 4 right in the patio, straight hitting the sun without any shade. All the way in the back, even though we purchased $70 VIP tix. We'd be better on the GA side, a little closer. The only plus of VIP was the open bar. Yet again, not worth $70/person.  3. The show - What show? These ladies simply walk around collecting tips and lip-syncing. I get it, they're \"famous\" and some people like to pay theextra price for meet-and-Greet; however, in my eyes I don't care if they're famous or not. I want a show. Piranha nightclub has better drag shows that this dump.  My suggestion is to go to Gospel Brunch off the strip. Only$5 to enter, better food, and an actual show worth your time.",

Because there was a birthday our waitress did their birthday shot which was so fun to be a part of. She blew this whistle and shouted to everyone on the patio to sing/scream along with her to their happy birthday chant. In total there was about 3 large shots that went straight from the bottle into the birthday gal's mouth! Which we totally weren't expecting. But so glad it happened!  The atmosphere was so fun and cheery. We sat on the patio and the weather was beautiful and so was the scenery! We'll definitely have to go back and eat this time! I hear the food is AMAZING!",

They tasted like they were frozen shrimps thrown into the fryer. Definitely not worth it. Drinks are super expensive as well. The three people with me did not like their food either.   Also, I asked to borrow a large stuffed frog to take a photo. A gentleman was walking around with it to take pictures. He refused lol- I am done. What happened to great customer service and great food? Will not be back here.",

Come on its just bar food, nachos, burritos, wings and tacos. The burrito that came with a handful of chips and salsa was $19. The wings came with 4 celery sticks and bleu cheese dipping sauce, they were meaty and drowning in sauce, which i loved. The 3 tacos came with a side of guacamole & salsa. These 3 items came to $57, they werent even meals. The restaurant closes at 10 which seems early for Vegas.",

Savanna was our server and she was very friendly. Although the yesterday wasn't terribly busy, the service was a tad slow. But we were there to have fun so we didn't mind too much.  An employee came and took our photo but he never returned with it or told us where to pick it up which was disappointing. The manager, Chuco, came over and offered us a free shot since we were celebrating a birthday and they were generous in size.   The food was just okay. I mean, we all knew what we were getting into going to Senor Frog's so we weren't expecting much. I guess you could say it lived up to our slightly lowered expectations. The tacos tasted fine but were nothing special and were a little cold. The \"Yard\" drinks were pretty tasty but not sure they were worth the cost.  The balloon lady came by near the end of our meal and created balloon hats for all of us which was fun. Overall it was a perfectly fine experience. Nothing special, nothing fancy, and honestly probably wouldn't go back again just because there's so many options to pick from in Vegas.",

I didn't complain... whatever.   Almost $20 nachos.. with olives? Yuck! And I like olives. Just n o t on my n a c h o s!  Since it's located inside Treasure Island I understand the pricing but if I ever return it will only be for drink specials and definitely not with my 10 year old as she now knows that turning 21 I involved 3 shots of tequila, head shaking and a whistle!",

I had to freeze my whole dinner.  The margaritas SUCK!  We ordered 2 yards of Mother Froggers which should have had Patron in them, but they tasted like watered down bottom grade margaritas.  The $9 tortillas soup was basically tomato soup with a few ingredients you can add in.  Im sorry but if I wanted to be robbed I would've just went to Mexico.

Like it's not disgusting, but wouldn't be my first, second, or even third choice. The burgers, fries and everything was tasteless  That all could be forgiven if they actually handled the alcohol properly. I tried the yard, and it tasted metallic and not very strong. I switched over to screwdriver, but apparently the bartender forgot that vodka goes in there because I only tasted juice. Another time when I came in, I was waiting at the bar for about 10 minutes, was barely acknowledged and it wasn't until one of my female friends who is quite easy on the eyes did my drink order get taken, and it was quite possible the worst AMF I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. You have to be absolutely horrible for me to stop drinking alcohol that I paid for The only good things about this place is that it's great for dancing, I had a blast doing that and the signs on the roof are funny, but not worth it for me",

I had a female promoter walk up on me & my husband with a beautiful smile ( could not hide behind it that she was under the influence)  she said loud & clear : open bar for ladies $15 & gentlemen pay $10 for cover only. When we got to the door things changed.. they charged $40 for both of us. -.- really? At that point,  after waiting and wanting a good time we paid and went in.  Open bar sucked, they don't serve beer, their well brands are cheap. Club was dead. Left a little after 2:00am waiting for the busy friday night that the bartender assured us would happen by 12am...  never ever did.",

Our waiter Billy hustled big time to get our drinks to the table and even check up on us.  This place is a dive bar/restaurant.  Yes they are a business but when it comes to an establishment catering to drunk college kids, do you really think you will get a five star dining experience?  Be prepared to wait for a table or even book a reservation.  Bring tons of friends and a fun attitude and I'm sure you will have a great time.  The food is actually good.  I had the pulled pork burger and our table ordered the nachos.  Both really good in taste and temperature.  I don't think they ever have a slow time.  Be patient, have fun and drink lots!",

The restaurant isn't helped by $13 for substandard sliders and $15 for a taco salad that is better at Taco Bell for a third of the price. If you want drinks, skip the $6 drafts and $12 cocktails here. Instead, go play video poker at the bar inside the casino and get them for free.",

    "text": "Terrible experience. Me and my boyfriend was approached in treasure island by one of the frogs promoters. One of which, stated they were the promotions manager. We stood chatting to them for ages, pleasant guys, asking how long we lived in vegas, blah blah.... Anyway, they gave us wristbands for the evening. Was something like 15 bucks for me, 10 for him. Was ladies drink free all night and we were told I can share the drinks with my bf, so effectively, we will be getting free drink all night. As this seemed too good a deal, we kept confirming with them what they were offering and they were like 'yep, that's right'. This was at 6pm- the club part the offer was for didnt open till 10 sowehung around waiting. We got into line and as we paid, I was given a cup. I said ' does my bf not get one?' To which they replied 'ladies drink free only' I explained what I had been told and by whom and was told 'if we are caught sharing drinks, we would be asked to leave' we left of our own accord- after paying 25 bucks - 10 of which for just admission for my bf into a crappy bar. We found the promotions guys straight away and explained it to them what happened- to which the guy told us he hadn't said that- even though 100%fact he did. And was obvious he was lying as he was stammering and stuttering all over the place and didnt look his friendly self like he I'd a few hours prior- but worried and nervous. Waste of money, ESP as we were out on a budget. Wasted 25 dollars. Yeah, we coulda stayed, but wasn't in the mood after getting lied to and paying for drinks when we were 100% told they were included.DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!  We are locals and will be telling all our friends not to bother",

Frogs is definitely our go to spot from now on! forget these negative reviews, trust me, it's fun.",

The service at the bar was prompt and my food came out quickly so no complaints for bar service. I ordered a beef burrito that cost 19 dollars. I ordered chips and queso and two margaritas. I expected to get a burrito with rice and beans like most Mexican plates. The burrito came out, it was very big but it had no sauce on it and no rice and beans For the price, it should have rice and beans. The food was not bad, just ok and the burrito was a little bland. The two margaritas came in small plastic cups and tasted like a fruit slushy, they were watery, very sweet  and very weak on the alcohol. All in all, my bill for one burrito, one chips and queso and two tiny, weak margaritas in a small plastic cup came to a whopping 55 dollars before tip. I realize that prices are higher on the strip but this was way too high priced for what you get.",

    "text": "Maybe we got lucky because we didn't go until the night after Cinco. We sat at the bar and got 2 for 1 half yards and half price appetizer. We got the nachos. We got like 7 pounds of nachos. Between the both of us we finished about maybe 1/4th of it and that included eating it at the bar AND more later that night when we got back to the hotel. It could feed 4-6 people easily. Anyways, the nachos were good, not great, but certainly edible. The drinks were rather good actually. So for our one experience there being there only 45 minutes to an hour we had a nice time. But reading some of the other reviews, again, maybe we just got lucky and went at the right time. And I'll add that the amount of food and quality of the 2 drinks for the price was well worth it. Even though nobody should eat 7 pounds of nachos!",

We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.  This will be the last time our group goes to senor frogs.",

I was patiently waiting for over 20 mins and after that I asked the bar tender if he could help me since I've been there waiting and he was helping other people that been there before me, his reply was well you need to wait until I ask you for your order and at the end of the day I am doing you a favor u need me I don't need you! And he started yelling out to other people if they needed drinks that I can wait!! Like last time I checked business make money off the people that come in and spend they're $$ on them there's a million places in Vegas that u can go spend your money on. But to go to a place spend $$ and get humiliated and embarrassed over just asking for a drink ??? All I asked was if I can get a drink and I said it nicely no need to be disrespectful!! If you don't like your job then quit simple as that no need to treat your customers like that.",

    "text": "Summary:  The wait staff does a very poor job or paying attention to the diners.  They are also very unprofessional and childish.  The food is pricey and bland, but they do give you a decent portion.  There is nothing at Senor Frogs that had a positive impact on me.  It's unprofessional and poorly ran.  I've never been to a Senor Frogs before so maybe they're all not like this one.  After being seated, no attention was brought to us by the wait staff for a little under five minutes.  The place was half full, but our waiter, Robert, was at a table next to us entertaining three moderately attractive girls.  We gave our drink and lunch order at the same time and the food came out pretty quickly.  The Philly Cheese Steak was bland and was served with gravy.  Not sure why they felt the need to give me gravy though...  Throughout our meal we were distracted several times.  A whistle sounded behind me and our waiter Robert was standing with one leg on the table next to us and one on a chair.  He was standing above a (what I assume was) a teenage kid holding a bottle of some mixed alcoholic drink.  The boys mother asked if it contained alcohol, confirming my assumption, and Robert said it did.  Regardless, he started tweeting his whistle and another waitress chanted \"Chug, chug, chug,...\" while pouring the drink down the boys throat.  Not long after, Robert was back at the table next to us desperately trying to hit on the moderately attractive girls.  He eventually put one of the ladies' face into his chest and had her motorboat him.  The two elderly couples at the next table were none too pleased.  Basically, Senor Frogs was very unprofessional and had pricey, bland food.  Additionally, they never brought my table the sugar for the ice tea we ordered.  I will not be returning.",

We ordered one appetizer, two entrees and a few drinks. The entrees took OVER an HOUR to come out after our order, the appetizer took an additional 35 minutes after that!! Seriously?!? It was a Tuesday, the place wasn't even packed! The waiter kept disappearing when we tried to get the check. When all was settled and done, we finally got to leave at about 10:30p! It's absolutely ridiculous to spend that amount of time in a very casual dining restaurant. A complete waste of time and money. Will NEVER go again! I gave it one stars because the food was edible. Barely.  Sorry for the very delayed review folks, this was from Aug of 2013. I can't imagine they've done a complete overhaul since then, though one could hope.",

It took 10 minutes to get new fries out.   Also, my friends chicken salad looks amazing when it came out... Well looks can be deceiving. There was zero taste, seriously, the sour cream was the only thing that made it edible.  Many reviews state that its about the atmosphere... Yea, absolutely... We had a good time (other than the fact that we got the ONLY server that had zero personality). But the prices DO NOT match the food quality. A Caesar salad for $17- give me a break!!

I have a lot of friends at home who do drag, so I thought we'd enjoy it. Bottomless mimosas and a host apologetic for the wait really made up for the 5 minutes we waited standing on the stairs to be seated. Drag was great fun, and I love the mix of tourists and LGBT locals who attended- it felt like home. Bypass all of the carbs on the bar, because there are tacos and guac at the end, and baby that's what you need to soak up all of the mimosa!",

They also recently changed the dancing floors it used to be hip hop downstairs and Mexican/Latin music upstairs but now it seems like Mexicans have taken over (don't get me wrong I love Mexican/Hispanic music) but I also like the hip hop, which now sucks, I feel like the old school hip hop is so much catchier and just better!

The only reason I went into this place was because we were staying at T.I.   Food. Intersting a mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa.. no worries but 5 bucks for stale chips and unseasoned tomatoes is over the top. I should have walked out at this point.   Food Part 2.... main dish quesadilla was was bland and the tortilla was the worst quality. It is like they are trying to cut every corner while paying a premium price.   Manager comes over and questions me like I'm an A**HOLE for returning the food when food orders where being returned left and right. We saw at least 3!   Dont waste your money.",

I don't mind paying a little extra being on the strip, but I would call this price gouging. Did not realize till the check came that 12oz Miller Lites were costing $8.50 each. True gouging!

It was definitely a bit on the expensive side, being that I did well on the tables outside I didn't mind.   The club side of it is a different beast!!!  Cover charge changes depending on how busy it is and what day it is.  One day it was $11 and the next $33. They have two floors and three dance floors for all your dancing needs.  The only negative thing I have to say about Senor Frogs is that they need more than one bartender per station. If you want a mixed drink you'll have to wait a very long time.  Overall a fun place to hang out in.",

Flash forward to that evening, I'm throwing up every hour throughout the night until 7am.

Only, apparently that sign was not a joke. The place was maybe 1/3 full, and yet when the hostess finally showed up to seat the line of customers, the line was informed that there were no tables available. Unless you wanted to just have a drink. If you wanted a drink, head to the bar but don't sit at any of the empty tables that there was a wait for. A walk through the restaurant to find a bar where the bartender actually cared about serving people revealed that there were tons of empty tables and plenty of unoccupied staff, so we enquired again - \"All the tables are full. 20 min wait for a table.\" Interesting business model.",

Having walked around the Las Vegas strip and not really finding what we wanted to eat, we went to Senor Frog's, which is near the Treasure Island casino & hotel. My wife and I ordered steak and chicken fajitas. The steak was quite good, but the chicken wasn't the greatest. I had to add extra hot sauce to liven it up a bit. We had a ton of leftovers, so we were able to bring it back to our hotel for a 2nd nights dinner, lol. The service was good. It seems that this particular restaurant caters more to a younger crowd, as it was a bit noisy and had videos of modern music playing on a few screens. Not really meant for an older crowd, but ok nonetheless.",

    "text": "Lackluster all around. First Drag show ever, and We went, thinking Las Vegas would have the best! I was so excited to see what kind of talents and looks the ladies had. We bought VIP for $74/each, because it had a \"meet & greet\" after.  Pros:  Open bar & bottomless mimosas at each table for VIP. The \"ladies\" were dressed beautifully and make-up was flawless! One of them could dance incredibly well and acted as the MC for a lot of the show. She was great! Cons: No wait staff ever came over. After sitting in our assigned seats for a bit, we politely asked for a seat in front, out of the spotlight. The seats we started in were right off to the side of the stage, a little to the rear, so not the best view, and the spotlight was blinding. The hostess acted like it was insulting to ask to move for a clearer view and acted put out about it. She wouldn't move us. 2 large tables were empty for over 20 mins into the show, so we finally moved ourselves, only to be told we couldn't sit there, and we had to be moved again! Ridiculous lack of care or concern, considering how much we paid to be treated as VIP. Apparently, that just means free drinks. The food was buffet style. Lots of choices- none outstanding or worth the price of admission. Very dimly lit, as well, with nothing marked on the buffet-guess what you're eating must be part of the fun.  All that aside, I wanted to love the show. It sounded so fun! The first part with audience participation was funny & the Drag Queen MC was great, although (as someone else mentioned) the sound system was awful!  Other than that first part, it was literally no show. Just a few drag queens lip synching and walking through the crowd, collecting $1 bills. Not really impressive or requiring any talent. One lady even lip synched a comedy skit....not sure why? Maybe memorization was the best she could do? It WAS a funny skit.  VIP Meet & greet was literally: line up, get your pic taken with the queens and watch them as they leave. They could not have been more disinterested in chatting or meeting anyone. It was disappointing, and I would suggest going to a real show, versus plopping down $74 for a non existent VIP treatment at this one. I would pay $15-20 MAX for this level of \"entertainment\" and food. Honestly, I'd suggest saving your money and getting a great meal & show elsewhere.",

The food for the brunch is both breakfast and lunch. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, potatoes, and then Mexican lunch style fare, with nachos, tacos, taquitos, etc.  We got way too much food, but it had a great taste!   The show itself was HILARIOUS! Everyone was super talented and entertaining. We were cheering and dancing along. Very gracious hostesses and amazing servers.

While the prices are little high they do give you a lot of food, I could barely finish half my meal and I was starving when I started from traveling!  The food was okay but nothing really to write home about.  A plus is you can charge your meal back to your room if you're staying at TI.

The drinks kept coming fast which is nice. We had nachos and it was a very big serving. We also had some beef tacos which is okay. The beef was kinda chewy but was still good. We came while it was very busy but the service was still very fast. We would definitely come back.",

My stars are for Senor Frog's at night time! If you go in before 10 you go in without a cover charge, you can chill and have some drinks while you wait. They have 2 sides with different music. I went on a Friday night and the inside was playing reggaeton music while they were playing more hip hop outside. Saturday night at around 11pm they had a live banda in the inside room and we were packed like sardines in there still very fun but we got very hot so we went to the outside room. They still had a mix of music not so packed like the inside. The dj was awesome. If you're in Vegas and want to dance make sure to stop here!",

The line is huge as expected but they let you in fairly quick, the music is great and the drinks are normal las vegas prices. What i had an issue with is that they let more people in than the occupancy recommended , you could not move or dance as it got later and more busier. I got really frustrated and wanted to leave which took us 30 mins to get thru the crowd and out the door, it just seems ridiculous to me that it gets so crowded you can't enjoy yourself, even with a table reservation you will be stuck.",

She was a little slow and not because the place was busy.  The food, dear God the food is very very expensive and it isn't good at all. Nothing was good and very small portions, dried and tasted old. $15 plain tasteless cheese quesadilla. Del tacos are better.   The restaurant itself is filthy. Disgustingly filthy. It's falling apart. The ceiling decor was nice but nothing impressive about anything else.  We had to ask for napkins and utensils.  This restaurant is seriously a joke and needs new management, better food and remodel or upgrade the crap that is falling apart and clean up.    I will never go here again.  Better places on the strip that cost the same with better food. Say $15 at Gordon Ramsey's burger place in planet Hollywood.  Don't waste your time here.",

Utilizing fountain drinks for maximum alcoholism allows for frogasms to tickle your inhibition and make your livers work it, like a glass of wata. It is a Senor spree to socialize, hydrate in a non-water sense, and enjoy the blares of club music. Featuring bootylicious bar stools with hardwood furnitures and an exterior view of the strip, one can summarize the experience as a gateway to street intoxication that is liberating and relaxing. Senor Frog checks off every need a customer wants in regards to lowering their responsibilities to increase utility and funness. More importantly it's a fancier beer garden worth taking a stroll and taking in a couple more ounces of liquid courage.",

The brunch was buffet style and also unlimited. The food was decent.  The show kicked off about 30 minutes later. The show itself was spectacular. Beautiful costumes, great music, audience participation, and comedy. I wish we could have sat there all day because it was over before I knew it. I will definitely be back!",

Its a mix! It gets super poppin! Theres indoors and outdoors. The view of the strip is nice when youre outside. They shoot confetti stuff and give out this inflatable stick thingys lol. They have 2 for 1 yard drinks and then they have a cash only bar cart with super inexpensive beers and patron citronage shots and other stuff. The shots come in neon test tubes and theyre like $1 or $2!! IF YOURE LOOKING FOR SPANISH MUSIC, COME HERE!",

Especially at these ridiculous prices! My girlfriends came here for happy hour which is between 3-6pm. No food specials but their souvenir cup drinks are buy one get one free. So roughly a yard would be anywhere between $10-$15 for one during hh.   We shared an order of chicken quesadilla, steak nachos and sliders. Chicken quesadilla was good. Nice pieces of grilled chicken but for some reason it was hard keeping it together. Not for the lack of cheese but whatever cheese they used didn't melt that well to glue the tortilla together. Steak nachos were awful! Hardly any steak and nothing about it would make me want to order it again. How can you mess up nachos? So easy!! Sliders were awful! Dry dry dry! The buns were so hard they were inedible. We really should have sent it back come to think of it. The patty looked like something that came out of the microwave. Are you serious?   Senor Frogs has so much potential! Such a cute theme and nice fun restaurant. Would be a great place to day drink and have a shareable meal, unfortunately it is just all crap. If you're looking for a fun day time place to lunch on the strip, I'd go to Diablos at the Monte Carlo instead.   And what's up with their servers/bussers?! You can't promote a young hip restaurant when every is older than my momma!  Tourist trap!! Take my advice and don't be a sucker!",

Literally tasted like they took it out of the freeze, unwrapped it and put it on our table. After we paid the bill ($53 for 3 small, watered down drinks and a brownie) our server said he'd take it off the bill (there was one bite gone after an hour) but then couldn't remove it because he said he ran the card already.   Don't come here.",

    "text": "My wife was so excited all day about visiting this place.  So we finally rallied our large group together, passed on some amazing other dinner choices to eat here.  She was told by many that this bar has really cool games you play once inside.  That you are guaranteed to have a blast.  Well let's just say that was not the case for our group of 12.  We arrived and right away it was an issue.  They didn't know whether they could seat us outside or not?  Then after several minutes they said it would be a 45 minute wait.  So we decided to be seated inside instead to avoid the wait.  From there it took our waitress forever to get us drinks.  We all orderd food and began the wait.  Food was just above par.  There was no games to be played.  When we asked about them they said there was budget cuts.  So here we are in Vegas and came to some lame place, we could have spent our 3 hours somewhere that wanted us to be there and had more fun.  The only reason I chose 2 stars is because before we left some gal heard our complaints and came over to make us all Ballon hats.  Some were hilarious that we wore during our night.  Saved this place from being talked bad about.",

It's a bar as in a LOUD, drunk people galore, people jumping up to sing karaoke, it's hard to get the wait staff people's attention, full on bar.   The entire wait staff is really young, (who else could stand the noise level in this place?). The food was actually pretty good. I had the tostada salad which was good but the chicken was cold. My hubs had the fajitas and he told me the same thing: cold chicken.   If you want to dine and still be able to speak to your dining companion and not just resort to reading lips, eat on the patio. We had to wait about a half hour but it's so worth it. You know, sitting in here, looking at the bar scene reminds me just how effing glad I am that I'm not a youn'in anymore and I don't have to prowl these types of places trying to find ...er....I'm not sure WHAT I was trying to find way back when...all I know is that I never found it in places like Senor Frogs.   Our waiter was really nice but the place was super busy so it took some time to get some menus. No problem, I realize Thanksgiving weekend will be packed anywhere you go.",

Our table was right by the exit , when we were getting ready to leave my bf's friend didn't want to leave. He wasn't drunk or anything , he had just drank 2 of the slush drinks , so he was just sitting there and we(myself, my bf and friends gf) were standing by the door. when all of a sudden a security tells my bf if the friend was drunk and my bf says no , so then the security tells my bf is he stupid or what and my bf asked him what. next thing i know the security pushes my bf and they start fighting , there was no need for that at all. now my bf is being tackled by other securities and some waitress is holding me back. all i was trying to so was to get the securities to stop hitting my bf.

Didn't even take a pic here since overall I was totally disappointed. Hotel was facing Treasure Island and it looked appealing from far away.

Some were more lively than others but bottomless mimosas and an open bar and everything everyone food was fantabulous. The good selection was pretty good. I love that they had guacamole and fresh fruit as well as a bunch of other tasty treats. Most of the girls danced and lip synced their hearts out. To give a sense of the type of humor in there, one of the girls pretended my sisters arm was male privates and used her hand to pleasure it. There is a lot of B's from the host, but these were good natured. She also had a great attitude. There was a divorcee group that kind of disrupted the show but she rolled with it. Added a lot of humor to it. I'd go again. I don't see how any two shows would be the same. I loved all the girls of course but the black chick who whined and danced hard was the best.",

We were just there to have a drink and visit with friends, not concerned about the atmosphere. It's still expensive, but affordable for Vegas. They did have a bikini contest though while we were there. Be careful, the drinks are very strong and very large. The next best deal for drinks on the strip is the $1 jello shots at Fat Tuesday (or Walgreens). We had a long list of things we wanted to do in Vegas in a short period of time, so we didn't fit nightclubs into our agenda. We also wanted to put our money toward attractions, and most clubs have a steep cover charge in addition to the pricey drinks, so we would feel obligated to stay longer and get our money's worth. This worked out because it was a quick casual stop where we didn't lose much time or much money.",

The food was so so fresh, I am a local and usually never go to the strip, was invited by a friend and I had such an amazing time! I recommend this place to anyone including but not limited to locals! Fun, Fresh food and amazing entertainment at a really reasonable cost not like other overpriced restaurants on the strip! Omar gave us amazing service and he was a manager and treated everyone with respect and made us feel like queens! Loved it so much and will be coming back!!! Celeste.",

The wait staff we dealt with- while not outright rude were not overly friendly. And the food was only so-so when considering the price.  There is a much better Mexican place just down the street by the Fashion Show- I suggest them over this place.",

I must say, out of all the venues we have worked with in the past 5 years in Vegas, the team at Senor Frogs were the most accommodating and polite as can be. Nicholas our bar tender was so professional the entire night and has a great personality too. Security was awesome and coordinated with us if they seen anything out of the ordinary or if they had any concerns which we really appreciate. They have plenty of space for all different types of parties, birthday parties, company parties, etc. and the place is actually really big! Overall, our event was a success thanks to the team at Senor Frogs and we will definitely be back!",

This restaurant/bar has two floors: the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor. They play R&B, rap and a little bit of everything. The problem is that is next to the patio so I don't think they have AC, or if they do is extremely hot!! ( I promise you I'm not on my menopause yet and I was sweaty). on the second floor, they play Latin music, the dance floor  has a decent size, but I went on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone there..

For such a prime price of real estate on the BLVD, this place is waisting away. On a Saturday night, there was maybe 20 people in the entire bar.

That should have been my 1st clue to leave.    When we were finally seated the waitress appeared offering water we were already prepared to place our order from waiting so long.  She took our drinks order and about 15 min later the drinks arrived. My drink came in this Palm tree plastic cup hmm ok whatever it taste good so we placed our food orders and waited and waited about 30 min which would have been fine except when they brought the orders out it was the wrong items. I ordered the BLT wrap which was correct but my husband who is super sensitive with his food had ordered the carnitas plate. They bought him tacos. He is a diabetic and was very hungry and edgy at this point. We did not take the tacos the waitress said he ordered tacos my husband said no I ordered the carnitas plate. We said being the check.   Check arrived and they charged me $24 for my drink WHAT it was from the slush machine I was charged $11.25 for the plastic Palm tree cup I told her I didn't ask for the take home cup and didn't want it. She said you can just leave it then.     By this time I had it wrong food order waiting forever to be treated like this. Never again  I will be sure to share my review with others",

The celling and walls are covered in corky saying and quotes everywhere, its a fun thing to be surrounded by.   Food was good, hot tasty and full of flavor. Now I didn't order anything off the menu I did the buffet offered up stairs! Excellent choice because down stairs get loud and crazy, a bit to much for my taste due to the live entertainment. Upstairs has its own bar area too so don't panic theres enough liquor to go around.   Servers I think are missing a screw or two in there brains; there forgetful, standing around, and kinda clueless really. This is why they lost a star in my books.",

The roasted squash is amazing.  The fish tacos were even better. Both dishes come with pico, guac, and sour cream.  Now the down side. Apparently they regularly have karaoke, and it's very loud. We sat on the deck overlooking the pond, yet still we had to shout to have any kind of communication. I guess it is our fault for not researching this establishment before hand. This is more a place for a party - style meal. Not very good for relaxing. We will be back. The food alone is worth the visit. $28 for the fijitas and 18 for the tacos.",

Unfortunately, this place lived up to its reputation.   We went on a Wednesday night, which is notoriously slow here in Vegas.  Even though they weren't crowded, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  We did end up being seated outside, which was nice. However, they were doing karaoke and during the karaoke sets the speakers were almost too loud.  Onto the service, it was just poor.  We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came over, and even then we had to ask for a server.  Our server walked by numerous times prior to us asking and not once did he greet us, or acknowledge us in any way.   Onto to food, I ordered the fajitas and the BF ordered a burrito.  Again, took a long time for the food to come out.  The food was just so-so.  I got the combination fajitas but I wish I just got the chicken, the beef was chewy and fatty.  The fajitas did have good flavor though.  The rice and beans tasted like something you'd get with a TV dinner.  His burrito was OK, but the chips that came with it were stale.   I suppose if you were drinking the experience may be slightly better. But, there's plenty of other places on the strip with the same kind of party atmosphere with better food and better service. All in all it was pretty disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it, nor will we go back.",

It doesn't have the same feel as the ones down in Mexico and the drink prices are very over priced even for a regular sized cup. Even the shots they brought around were $3 and I'm not sure how strong they were. Granted this place is in the TI casino, but it still shouldn't be that expensive.  The staff was friendly and the band that was playing that night was entertaining, but  the music was just too loud that I couldn't even hardly talk to my gf. I saw other couples switching seats so that they could also talk to each other.",

That's if they even put some in the drink. There was 4 of us. Two of them kids. Even with sharing meals and having water and maybe 1 drink. It was over $60.00.

He spoke to me like I was bouncing out on the bill even though I paid my part. I told him the rest of the people I was with would pay their share. Seriously, nobody had any intentions of dining and dashing out but he looked at me like I just came out of San Quentin. I told him so your basically holding me hostage. Jorge still wouldn't budge. The waitress was nice. Nothing against her. The way they do things there I guess are exactly the same way they do things in Tijuana. Anyhow, I'm never coming back to this ghetto ass chuntarito place ever again. Eff yoo see kay senor frogs. Your business model is crap and I hope you close down soon. It's a shame treasure island let you rent space from them. I personally think you bring their property value down. You all are rude and well, I pray you close. Oh that's right, I already said that.

After 30 minutes I walked up to the desk and asked how much longer wait it was going to be, the girl snapped at me and told me she's been waiting for us to show up (mind you she never called our name) I explained to her that she never called our name and she proceeded to tell me she texted my phone so I explained that the text never went threw and she should have called for us sense we sat right out side the restaurant. She then sat us down and the waitress came over and told us we had 5 minutes to order food because the kitchen was closing. Made our decision on what we where going to have to drink and that was water and then took our order and ran away. We got our food 30 minutes later still without asking us if we wanted something else to drink she ran away again and didn't come back until she had a check in her hand so we are getting ready to pay and the nice people at the plaza hotel gave us a gift card to use. The waitress never came back to get the check or the card for us to pay so I went up to the bar to pay. The service here is terrible and the people are nothing but rude to you we will never be eating at this location again for that reason. The food was great but the service sucked!",

The selection is excellent, but the food itself was neither hot nor particularly well-made.  For the HIGH price, the food is simply NOT worth it, even taking into account he value of the performers themselves.  Also worth noting:  They did NOT accept credit cards for payment, but demanded cash.  We were not prepared to shell out a few hundred dollars in cash when we got on the line, and that caused some delays in getting us seated due to having to locate a nearby ATM to get money.  Seriously, this is 2018, and who in their right mind in Las Vegas doesn't accept credit cards?!  What a royal pain in the you-know-where!!!  As for the drag show itself, well, that was fun.  Many of the performers are previous contestants on RuPaul's Drag Race and, thus, are seasoned drag performers.  Not the best I've ever seen, but as a troupe, they're solid.  Best part of the show for me, by far, was the performer doing the Tina Turner songs, with Adele being a reasonably close second.  Note to would-be visitors:  Although reservations are not required at Senor Frog's, you would be well-advised to have them.  This place can be quite busy and seating is by no means guaranteed without an advance ticket.",

Section I also had a voucher from Groupon that I tried to use to get two yard sticks the bartender was very rude and said she couldn't honor the deal until they close which is at 4 a.m. if I'm spending that much money on bottle service I should receive some decent service!!! There was also a fight in the V.I.P. Section and the splashes there drinks all over our table. The security also didn't even kick the people that fought out they just talked to one of the guys and just laughed it off. This establishment is very unprofessional if you want to have a good time I recommend taking your money elsewhere there are plenty of bars in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is not your father's Senor Frog's.  My wife and I have fond memories of dining at Senor Frog's in Coral Gables, FL in the 80's.  It was an excellent Mexican restaurant with a variety of tasty, well prepared Mexican dishes.  So, when we saw Senor Frog's smiling frog face at Treasure Island we were excited to relive the experience.  DIDN'T HAPPEN!!!  This Senor Frog's is basically an over sized bar, serving bar food quality dishes and the noise level is so high that it is difficult to have a conversation over dinner.  It isn't even a Mexican restaurant anymore.  Although, they do offer tacos, enchiladas and burritos and a variety of other things including spaghetti, hamburgers and BBQ.  The chips and salsa, which aren't complimentary, are not worth the 5 dollar price tag.  Seriously, we've had better salsa out of a jar.  Can anyone spell PACE?  We had the cheap margarita.  If, you can call 11 dollars cheap (top shelf was 13 dollars).  It was served in a small plastic mug and didn't even come with a lime wedge.  And, to make matters worse, they weren't very good.  If you want a really good margarita, go across the Strip to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at the Flamingo.  Jimmy knows how to make a margarita.  If you want really good Mexican food and margaritas, then, go to Lindo Michoacan.  There are several locations in Las Vegas; but, none are on the Strip.  So, you have to drive.  But, the drive is worth it.    We had lousy chips and salsa, 2 lousy margaritas,  an over priced order of 3 fish tacos and an over priced chicken quesadilla for $62 including tip.  We'd have been better off putting the money in a slot machine.  The return on investment would have been better.",

So when I saw the swirling machines as I was walking through another casino (Treasure Island, maybe?) and I didn't already have a drink in my hand, I made a bee-line right over (really hard to do in a casino). I already had a souvenir glass (several, actually) and he said he'd give me the refill price to fill it even though it wasn't theirs. I think I chose the \"fruit punch\" option. There were only 2 options and I think the other was \"margarita\". Whichever one I chose, it tasted like it had a frog in it. I joked that that was the origin of the name, but seriously it was not good. I was able to go to a regular bar in the casino and have them add some grenadine to cut the frogginess and it made it palatable enough to finish. There's a great daiquiri place in San Diego (Wet Willies; they have multiple US locations) but in SD you can't take your drink out with you like in Vegas. That still doesn't make up for the frog flavour.",

    "text": "So I went here on Saturday May 19th.  I'd heard a lot about this place, seen it on the Internet, etc., and wanted to try it out for myself.  The place was small inside and a bit overrated.  The drink list they showed us was WAY overpriced.  Drinks starting at $10 each and going onwards of $12, $20, etc (good thing we had popped open beers we had brought ourselves before entering the restaurant).  I thought the menu would be strictly Mexican food, but it was a mixture of Mexican, Tex-Mex, and American.  Everything on the menu was about $12 and up for a plate.  The food was decent, but unlike other Mexican restaurants where they provide free chips and salsa, they charge you $4.99.  Here's the kicker.  When I got my bill, I realized the tax was $11 (my total bill was approximately $76).  When I alerted the waitress of this, she checked with the manager to find out why the tax was so high and he said that there is a 10% \"Entertainment\" tax.  WHAT?!  Entertainment tax?  I've never encountered such a thing.  There was absolutely no entertainment of any sort going on, unless you consider a MC chick trying to get the crowd all pumped up entertainment.  Due to this ridiculous entertainment tax and high prices, I don't think I'll be going here again.  Please check your receipts to see if you got charged this \"Entertainment tax\" too.  Totally outrageous.",

    "text": "We had a Groupon, otherwise the score would have probably been only 2. The food wasn't that great for the price. However, their drinks were super yummy and not terribly priced considering it is located in Vegas. I got the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, and I wasn't impressed. The fries that came on the side tasted good though. My friend got the Cheese Enchiladas and said they were a bit too spicy for her liking, but otherwise good. In addition to so-so food, it was an extremely loud environment. There was at times a band, other times karaoke singers, and in between there was someone on stage talking and having games to win a free shot of alcohol. This I suppose could be someone's cup of tea, however it wasn't mine. Too loud and just average food. Also, there seemed to be only children and older people, no one really in between. It was strange seeing 40+ year old women screaming drunk right next to us, but I suppose that's Vegas for you!",

The first appearance of this place was \"ok cool, this could be fun.\" until we got to our table. Once we sat down, the air was so thick and HOT that it was hard to breath, once we asked if they could turn on the air or the fans, their reply was \"I don't know if we have any.\" Then the swarm of Effin gnats flying around, mass of dead bugs on the window sills, we asked for a new table. We finally got to our new seats next to an open window with an awesome view of the \"T.I. Harbor\" which we thought, ok this is better. Upon sitting there, the gnats were so over-whelming, that everytime you open your mouth to take of a bite of this CRAPPY food, you also ate a few gnats along with it!!! It was simply disgusting, flying in your face and up your nose, just crawling in your ears.. HORRIBLE. I've lived in Vegas almost 7 years, and by far... the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT I have ever had the displeasure of eating at. My Gf and I are Chefs at hotels here, and this place was just sad. The only reason for the \"1\" star.. you get a cool view of the pirate show, which none on Senor Frogs staff members attempt to warn you of the fire and explosions 15 feet out the window, we had twin 8 month old babies with us...I have never Yelped before, but this place brought an urge on me to do so. Its a POOR ass Attempt at mexican food, actually a Disgrace to my culture and heritage... DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!",

First off it is very LOUD in here so if that bothers you this place is not for you! The atmosphere is great!! A dj, a host that is interacting with everyone & getting everyone to participate in dances & trivia contest for free SHOTS!! it was really fun! The waiter we got was just ok. Very friendly but not attentive at all. I got the nachos & they were very good!! My husband got the wings & he seemed to enjoy them but he doesn't complain about much so who knows! Lol. I got a drink called Mother Frogger for $11 it was loaded with alcohol so very worth it for the price! I then saw other people drinking out of tall palm trees so I told my hubby I HAD TO HAVE ONE!! I ordered the watermelon frozen drink in the palm & it was very good but could not taste the alcohol.. They also have someone making cute balloon hats for everyone & someone taking pictures for souvenirs. I read another review here that said the pics were free but they are NOT!! $15 for a pic! But I bought it cuz they put a cute mustache & sombrero on my hubby in the pic!!  Overall a fun time & I will come back!",

Over-priced drinks and listening to the 97.5 dj trying to keep the energy up. We got there at 10 pm and the show was a lil late by 2 AM the crowd was enormous,  it was hella hot, packed in like sardines, no show. We left our folks there because hell it was 2 AM and we weren't gonna spend $200 plus for bottle service. Never saw E40 or Suga Free and I find out E40 didnt come on stage until 4 AM and did 3 songs and left. (Blank Stare). Rip off. Luckily we won these tickets, but for those who bought them, I'd be all over the sponsors for a poor product. Senor Frogs, I know you're in it for the money, but packing people in with no promised show until the frikkin morning is not cool. And if I could write a bad review to E40 on yelp, I would.",

We arrived and were seated right away outside on the patio, the windows were covered with dust and who knows what else. Although we were outside we had to scream to hear each other.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of Chips and Salsa ($5!!) which were ok. It took about 30 minutes to receive them. I ordered a chimichanga and my girlfriend ordered a taco salad -- after a while it finally came. My chimichanga came soggy, and the plate was a mess, it looked as if they had spilled onto it. In fact, there was a french fry underneath the chimichanga. The rice was hard like it had been reheated and the overall taste was horrible. My girlfriends salad looked great but tasted like nothing, and the waitress who never returned also did not bring dressing. We left severely disappointed after paying a whopping $51 for a terrible meal and mediocre service.",

She sat us at a table in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables that hadn't been bussed, they were never bussed while we there.  My water glass had paper stuck inside the glass, the food was inedible.  We sent the cold fries back and they return with fries five minutes later just as cold.

    "text": "Educational is the word that comes to mind!  I spent a Sunday afternoon learning how not to treat a customer. From the below average food to the lousy service it was quite a display. The price is inflated considering the quality. The topper was when I received my bill and handed them the groupon that I had just purchased the day before they told me they were not honoring them anymore.... I asked to speak to manager .... Big mistake the idiot they sent me should probably picked a career working with animals not people.  He tried to be apologetic by telling me he didn't sell me the groupon so I had to understand that my 75.00 bill that should have been 25.00 with my voucher was.... Um we'll too bad!  Lol. I would have got mad but was so shocked at the lack of care for a customer I just paid the bill without tipping and thought I got the best education today. I can use this experience while training my customer service staff in the future.  I will call this training \"what not to do\" when dealing with people. I know they will still have plenty of customers willing to go there, pay the inflated prices and get lousy value however they will never see a penny more out me and I will make sure to tell everyone I meet or know about the people at senior frogs.",

They've only been open a month but they all seem to enjoy it and did the stage dancing and singing like old timers.  The manager Michael was so professional and nice, while being fun.  My dad had on an original senor frogs t shirt from decades ago. The manager loved it and brought us an amazing dessert.  Then he was on the stage with his servers dancing.  It was great.  The food service was fast and the drinks were strong, I had a daiquiri. The food is mediocre but who goes there for the food???  You go for the fun and atmosphere.  Drinks by the yard, singing on the stage and the Congo line.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp...it was ok.  Son had the chicken sandwich and fries...he enjoyed it.  Dad had nachos and mom tacos....both were also enjoyed.  For Vegas the price is reasonable.  Great place for parties like bachelorette, etc, but wouldn't bring young kids (and there were a few in there ).  Also nice outside seating (less boisterous) with w good view.  I will definitely go back.  Thanks mike the manager for making the night so fun for my dad.",

    "text": "Well.   Now, keep in mind.... I have been a fine dining server for 14 years, and a pretty darn good one at that. I really wish I could find other hospitality staff as dedicated to the guest as I am with my own guests. Definitely couldn't find that here. Let me tell you what happened.  Not much to say besides this place was HORRIBLE. I was in Vegas alone, and craving some shrimp fajitas. When I walked in, I asked the hostess if I could be seated outside. She asked how many people? I replied, \"Just me.\" She said, \"There's a bar outside where you can order food. You can sit there if you want.\" I replied, \"umm, so I can't get a table for one outside?\" She said, \"No, not for one.\"   Now, I don't know who this girl is turning down a person because they are only one. I tip as much as four people would, and probably would've tipped more that night being I had just won $1300 10 minutes before walking into this place.   Anyhow, I said ok, and made my way to the bar.   Once at the bar, I took one of the only seats available...it was near the end of the bar, and appeared to be near a service station. Oh well, I guess I have no choice.   It was a busy night, and being I saw 3 people behind the bar, I assumed they would have the service covered. BOY was I WRONG. I sat there with nothing in front of me for a good 10 minutes. NO exaggeration. I actually looked at my watch. NO Acknowledgement. No eye contact. NOTHING. I even said to the couple next to me, \"How has the service been tonight. They just shrugged, and said, \"It looks like they're pretending that they haven't seen you yet. \" And they laughed.   As much as I hate doing this, I waved my arm in the air as if in a tacky chinese restaurant. I even said \"Helllllllllllllllo???? \" out loud. FINALLY he comes over and says, \"yes?\"   I said, \"Hello, how are you this evening? Sorry to BOTHER you, but may I have a menu?\" He gave me a drink menu, and before I had the chance to correct him and request a dinner menu, he was gone again. Like the wind. Then I sat another 10 minutes waiting for him to come back around again. Which he never did. Finally I flagged the OTHER bartender down, and said, \"Hi, I wanted to see a dinner menu please...oh, don't go away. I already know what I want.\"   I ordered the shrimp dish. Then I asked where the bathroom is. His reply was \"You're sitting next to it.\" and he laughed. I wasn't amused. He continued, \"JUST KIDDING. It's outside in the casino.\" I just nodded, unamused.  When I got up and went to find it, I never wound up going back.   So, I left. Still starving. And VERY dissatisfied & ashamed of the HORRIBLE service.   There wasn't a manager to be found either.   DON'T waste your time or energy on such a crap shoot.",

She seemed rushed and wanted to quicken our Decision on food. About 45 min later we received our nachos from some gentleman who wasn't our waiter. I kept waiting for the waitress to come by and check on us so I could ask for salsa. 30 min into eating our food she stops by and I ask for salsa after half our nachos are gone. We received the salsa from another gentleman who wasn't our waiter after our food was all gone. I then had to walk through the restaurant to find her to ask for the check.  I waited 20 more minutes and finally just left what I thought would be exact amount of bill on the table in cash and let ourselves out. She was rude and obviously unorganized.",

    "text": "My group of four ended up here after first going to Kahunaville and experiencing horrible service. We were attracted by the rowdy party atmosphere--it was Friday night--and the fact that all of the customers seemed to be wearing balloon hats. We were in Vegas for my girlfriend's birthday and a loud, rowdy, balloon-hat-wearing bar experience was exactly what she was looking for.  The atmosphere was definitely silly with signs all over the walls and ceiling painted in dayglo colors and cute freestanding signs that looked like fingers pointing placed around everywhere. I dragged one over to our table that said \"high maintenance\" and placed it behind my girl's head and it took her 10 minutes to catch on. So funny! Definitely no shortage of interesting decor.  Our server was awesome! Didn't catch his name. He was adorable, charming, funny, and attentive even though they were pretty packed. We'd already eaten dinner and just wanted drinks (diet coke for me, as I was the designated driver). As far as the food reviews go, it sounds like we probably didn't miss much. He kept the drinks coming and made some good recommendations for my GF. Even better, they have all these little games and activities. They really get everyone involved with the promise of free shots. They had us standing on our chairs, acting out hand motions to go with a song they taught us. Then they got everyone wanting a free shot to form a conga line around the restaurant and had a server pouring shots down people's throats, two or three different times around the restaurant.They had a few different contests where they made volunteers stand on stage and see who could chug a free beverage the fastest, and they made one girl sing karaoke for a free drink. Several servers, including ours, got on stage and danced around. It was hilarious! Our server was the best dancer out all of them! The MC was very funny and entertaining, he did a great job controlling the action, keeping the games going, and generally making sure everyone enjoyed the evening,  There was a cute young gal going around making balloon animal hats for everyone for free. She made some fairly elaborate balloon hats for my group, then took a couple pictures of us wearing them, then took a picture of herself! She was too funny! She got a good tip from our table.  Everyone in there was having a good time. There were at least two other groups there celebrating a birthday. My girlfriend and her cousin and cousin's husband all had a blast. EXACTLY the zany, silly, alcohol induced shenanigans we signed on for when we booked the trip. We were all talking about Senor Frogs for the rest of the weekend. Even though the price was extravagant for our budget--like almost everything we bought in Vegas--we felt we got good entertainment for our money. We'll definitely come back next time we're in town!",

The spinach dip with tortilla chips was ok.  I thought the chips could be a bit better tasting. Our entrees, a chicken taco salad and a beef burrito were tasty. My chicken was a bit on the luke warm side but tasted fine none the less.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. A bit overpriced for the quality but the quantity makes up for it.",

Once in line and talked to the door guy I was notified that I couldn't go back upstairs with my frozen drinks that I had just purchased downstairs. Was extremely upset bc i was there for a birthday party. For a $20 cover, and to spend 60$ in the first ten minutes and not allowed to go back in. This was not a great first time experience. No one working at this place knew what was going on. They need to have a staff meeting and clarify rules to fix dilemmas like this one so this doesn't happen again.",

    "text": "HATED IT.  The husband got a one day Groupon offer for $25 for $50 and wanted to go there.  I thought, okay, I can hit ONE chain while in Vegas.  UGH!  What a hot mess.  The service was good, with the exception of trying to pay, my husband did not want to just hand over his mobile phone for them to get the Groupon code from so they made him go up to the cashier so that she could use HER mobile phone to scan it.  Other than him getting irritated over that and charging us for tortillas that should have come with the meal, I found the service attentive.  That was the end of the good for me.  I had a hard time deciding what to get so I finally just got a Mexican Platter which was a bunch of different things.  It came with steak (tasty, but tough), chicken enchiladas (not tasty, dry, and funky), a chimichanga (boring), some fried jalapenos stuffed with cheese (probably the best thing on the plate - hard to jack up deep fried pub grub), beans (my husband said they were great - I don't eat beans), and rice (yuck).  Plus sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  I felt like with the steak, it should have come with tortillas because usually that's how I eat Mexican steak, you kinda shove it all in a tortilla, so I asked for a tortilla and they brought me three small flour tortillas (barely warm) and charged an extra $2.50 to my $25 plate.  The husband ordered, as usual, buffalo chicken wings, served with ranch dressing, celery, and carrots, and he liked them, although I found them a disturbing color of neon red.  I had ordered a drink in a plastic palm tree.  Now that glass was an interesting shape!  YIKES!  But, I ordered something with rum and tropical fruit punch flavors, all frozen-y.  It was good and I think it was about 22 oz for $20.  The total bill came out to about $70.  AT A SENOR FROGS!  So overpriced for seriously low quality food.  They should be embarrassed.  It's True that my other experiences with Senor Frogs were all in Mexico where the food is good and prices reasonable and here we are in Vegas, but let me suggest you choose another option for your Mexican dining pleasure.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",

The blaring music, copious amounts of drinks, and grinding on the dance floor screams college.   As a stop on our long journey of bars to visit, SF was not the most impressive. We had more fun in the outside bar. The stools that resembles girls' rear ends with funny expressions was one of the highlights of the night. They provided us with many pictures to sum up the whole experience. Inside the jams were bumping and the balloon hats gave us more photo ops.  It is part of the TI trifecta, but not a place to go to on its own.",

But I took a chance... and we went into this overpriced tourist trap.   It is located in Treasure Island.     First of all we had our kids with us.. and when we walked through the casino to the restaurant, they said it would be about 15 min and that we could sit on the bench outside the restaurant.   We sat down there, and then one of the Casino Security People came by to say that my children could not sit there, that they had to stand in the restaurant.   I protested but he acted like he wouldn't mind kicking us out of the Casino altogether... so we complied.      Once seated, I told the waitress that we had a groupon coupon, and that we wanted to spend $50  but no more and no less.  She offered to let me know how much it was as the meal progressed and I said great.   Well, the place was fun and the signs on the ceiling were fun to read... and we were enjoying the tourist flavor of the place.  We ordered.... but the menu was very expensive.   Appetizers were $28  slammers were 13 clam chowder was 8 and a couple of beverages brought the tab to $67 dollars?  Then I had some trouble with the waitress taking my cell phone... then demanding that I go online to the Groupon site...so she could redeem my coupon.  I went there after some awkward moments... and it was already redeemed.  Then I asked for my bill and a to go box, and she brought the bill, but after that.... she went on to wait on other tables,... and we had to go hunting for a to go box.     The food.... the food was ok, but not HOT, the soup was lukewarm,   the pepsi was in a tiny little mug......the sauces were old and prepared in advance so the Guacamole was dark on top... the sour cream had water around it... so it was sitting in a fridge for a few hours...... the whole experience was a dissapointment, as I didn't expect to have to pay another $25 for the balance of the tab and tip.  I will not be returning to this place.   So after a  long drive to the strip.. having to park and walk a mile.... waiting and being harrassed by security, then finding that  this place is priced so high.... that even with a groupon coupon... it is a rip off...I don't recommend anyone go there.   There are so many great restaurants off the strip.... we have gone to Senor Frogs in Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta... but I don't think their prices were so high.. and at least they cooked the food fresh and hot.",

For having to be in front of the treasure island casino and on a holiday weekend it was relatively empty during prime time vegas hours.   I believe the reason for this was because they were charging $10 at the door. The music was mediocre and the bar tending service was okay. Drinks were served ok but they just lack a certain element to be considered somewhere fun to go in las Vegas. After I found out that there was no restroom and drinks were expensive I was glad to have been there only for a relatively short time. Try going somewhere is my suggestion to you.",

I had chicken enchiladas that were barely covered in a sauce that was more like an Italian pasta sauce with Feta cheese. The beans and rice are served on the side and were also quite bland as well as being lukewarm. Sister had fish tacos that were tolerable only after a liberal dousing with hot sauce. Beers were $8.50 each and served in plastic cups. Our meal cost a total of just under $75 for two of us. I realize this is Vegas but good Mexican food should not be that hard to prepare. The wait staff is pleasant enough but they, too, need a bit of upgrading. They say \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\". There is a good reason.

We ordered nachos, and cheese steaks, as well as a soda and one refill.  To start, the Soda is $6 each! The two pops I had were $2 less than my meal. The cups were half filled with ice, so the pop was very watered down. We were offered the unbalanced cups to take home, but they were heavily used and dinged. When getting the bill, I confronted the waiter about the price and he didn't seem to care, or make any effort to resolve my concern.  The food we ordered was terribly bland, and I am disappointed this was my last dinner Vegas. The nachos were soggy because they put all the toppings on top of the chips (guacamole, sour cream, salsa, fried beans). The cheese steak was terribly bland and dry, with just a thin layer of beef.  The restaurant itself was empty, although we went at dinner time. This could be for a number of reasons, but it meant a restaurant with blaring music, 5 servers bothering us every minute, and a friendly note on the bill that said  \"Tips not included.

I asked the server politely to top it off as it was too spicy and it came back spicy again.  I tried to be a good sport and drink it, but it was burning my esophagus.  Did I ask for cold liquefied salsa and sugar in a cup? Ewww.  Also, it was in one of those clear plastic cups from the dollar store.  For the prices, the could use better cups!  I do not recommend this place to anyone.",

If you're looking for somewhere with non watered down drinks and amazing customer service! This is your place! Don't forget to ask for Jamal!",

We found the back bar sat down and  order drinks and food.  I order tacos and chips and salsa  my best friend order steak. It took 30mins for are food to come out  but are waiter Chris and the other young lady which I didn't get her name were  sweet. We could here the music and have fun.

I knew it would be overpriced and the food only so-so ahead of time as its a tourist trap restaurant.  We get there, and its a 30 - 45 minute wait.  that was fine as it is to be expected.  We get our buzzer and patiently wait outside in the casino in the designated waiting area.  45 minutes go by and I go up to the hostess to check on our status and am informed that the kitchen was having issues and needed to be partially shut down about 20 minutes ago.  She told me it would be another 30 - 40 minutes.  Guess what we did.  We left.  My issue is simply the poor guest service.  If they are having issues such as this then people in the waiting area need to be informed their wait is going to be twice as long as they were told.  Senor frogs is not worth a 15 minute wait much less a hour and a half no matter what its location.  Won't be going back.",

But, sadly, here I am in my hotel room in Vegas, damn near curled up in a ball because I am retaining SO MUCH WATER from all the sodium in your food. My mom and I each ordered a chicken fajita plate, my sister a fettuccini alfredo plate, and my step dad a fish taco plate. My poor step dad didnt get to enjoy much of his meal because the rest of us defaulted to his plate because we couldnt stand the saltiness of our meals.  It didnt seem so much of an over-seasoning of a single plate or a mistake made in the kitchen, but that their food/seasoning is just crazy-salty.   And to ice that with a $96.00 bill where none of us even ordered an alcoholic beverage....no thank you. I wont be returning. Sad too because it really does seem like a fun place, but...this is Vegas...",

Also, they had a great atmosphere, an energetic and entertaining DJ, good music spinning and some of the staff was energetic. They could dance well, so that definitely counts for something too.  I thought my food was so-so. At best. I got the chicken enchiladas, and to be quite honest, I've had several microwave enchiladas that were better than these ones. There was no cheese on the inside of the enchilada, a random slice of swiss cheese (swiss cheese in Senor Frogs?) on top of the enchiladas and there was also no sauce in the inside of the enchilada. The sauces were served on the side and were delicious, definitely, and the guacamole had some character (I stole it from my fiance), the rice was decent and the beans were just beans. I also disappointed by my lackluster corn tortilla. Just not exciting.  My fiance's food was tasty for him. Chicken tenders (if you mess those up you should pack your bags), chicken quesadilla, barbecue wings and taquitos. The chicken quesadilla was good, but nothing too exciting, the wings were also good, but nothing to write home about, the chicken tenders were great for him and so were the taquitos. His platter came with a bunch of sides which was nice (sour cream, guacamole, salsa, etc), but it just didn't excite either of us in any way. My friend also get the Tex-Mex Tacos and they just weren't exciting. Seriously. Blah.  The one thing that saves this place? THE DRINKS. Wow are they good. If you don't want something sweet, try the Pimp Frog Juice. It has every liquor possible but not a lot of juice; it could get you in a lot of trouble though! The best value is getting the drink in the palm tree cup that should be Rated R due to its shape. LOL. Sorry. I reverted back to adolescence there. The drink is a perfect size and you can take the glasses around after you leave the restaurant and move on to more booze and happier times. The drinks are pricey, don't get me wrong, but fun in the moment. Don't get me wrong...this place has a great atmosphere, especially at night, and offers a lot for birthday parties and bachelor/bachelorette parties, but skip the food and don't expect 5 star service. Some places are better after several drinks than before.",

My husband and I ordered the carne asada that came with a chimichanga for $29.50.. The meat was chewy, skinny, and fatty throughout with gristle and they didn't ask how we wanted it prepared which is crazy for a $30 meal,  the chimichanga I SWEAR was from Albertsons in the frozen food section because it tasted like the chimichanga I eat when I'm in a rush at home.    PLEASE!!! Don't eat here if/when you visit Vegas.. We live here for the time being and had company in town and decided to eat here before Mystere (a show at TI) and it was so bad every one of us said it was the WORST food, service, and price we'd ever had, even for the strip. This place should be shut down..   OH!  I was just reminded... I ran into another diner sitting near us that was appalled and ran into her in the bathroom and she was feeling sick and figured it was probably food poisoning.   One final note - They make balloon hats, etc. for kids or people with birthdays and when you're seated in the restaurant the person filling up the balloons with air constantly pops them which freaks you out.  I only write on Yelp if something is this bad.. THIS is that bad and needs to go away..",

We had 2 different servers a guy and a girl. The guy kept forgetting what drinks we wanted & kept coming to our table to ask. He took my phone to redeem the groupon & didn't bring it back. When we finally asked for it (after 20 minutes) he didn't even know where it was. The food was HORRIBLE, $20 for a COLD burrito & $20 for a COLD quesadilla.

Most of the things we didn't like about our visit other reviewers have already mentioned in recent reviews: our table was all sticky even though we were among the first customers for the day; the hard chairs were uncomfortable, if you're not tall your feet will be dangling when you sit; our nachos were good but my friend said his chicken fajitas were really lacking in flavour and my beef chimichanga was not even the way it was described in the menu -no cheese, no sour cream, only a tiny bit of sauce underneath and inside half the filling was the same red rice that was served as a side order on my plate. Why would somebody want so much rice? This was a very poorly composed entree. How about getting rid of some of that rice and instead have some retried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, salad or something instead of all that rice?  And you better like that bright red sauce they use because they seem to use it on everything; the nachos, the rice, the sauce on a stuffed tortilla.  After I asked for my missing sour cream it didn't get brought to our table until we had both given up on wanting to eat this overpriced, bland meal.  Oh yeah, the tall Margarita slush drinks tasted weak, too. If you want a good one with lots of Tequila at a good price try the Circus Circus casino.  We were kicking ourselves thinking that we could of had a pretty good steak dinner somewhere else for what we paid at this joint, and we had a Groupon too. Never again; you've been warned.",

Food is super expensive, $15 for a chicken sandwich and a basket of fries, $15 for a tray of nachos.  Water was free!!   DJ  tried real hard to be like the ones in Cancun. Not close. But good try!  If you want to try it out just walk in and around the place for a feel and you will quickly find you aren't in Mexico and it's a waste of time and money.",

I can't speak for the quality of the food, but the staff seemed to be overwhelmed,confused and just freaking not communicating with each other.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to actually acknowledge we wanted to be seated...put i gave it a pass.  They gave us a table but we wanted to sit outside..it was a nice day  why not, and the place was not crowed. It took us 15 more minutes to get the attention of a server to let them know we wanted another table. ...from there it was all down hill. One server ignored us while passing us 3 times...no one know who's station we were at..we wasted 45 minutes without being served. I get you are on the strip...i get it, but please make sure you try to at least help your cutomers out",

Guys paid 33$ ridiculous amount to be honest! I only gave it 4 stars because it was WAY TOO CROWDED! They need to get a bigger spot especially because it's ok the Vegas strip and it seemed to be the only Mexican/regional and a second dance floor with English music!! We were dancing and it was annoying bumping into people non stop!!  but maybe only because it was NYE but I would definitely go back again!",

We travelled from the UK to Vegas and where super excited that the Drag brunch was hosted by Shangela and featured queens such as Coco Montrese, Yara Sofia, India Sahara and friends. The cost of this show is pretty reasonable considering you can get brunch and free mimosa's or upgrade to VIP for brunch and open bar.   The show is really funny and a perfect way to start your weekend off. Shangela is really funny and despite being a self proclaimed \"professional\" she lived up to it. The queens at today's show were on fleek and very friendly.   The crowd at the AM show filled the room where as the pm show only half filled the place. Both audiences where energetic and helped make the entire day fun.   Look past the mediocre reviews on this place as a venue, if you are wanting to enjoy a Saturday am come here to the drag brunch, you won't be disappointed.",

The draw back to the show was the performers soliciting tips from the audience.  While they were grabbing for the dollar bills through the audience during their performance, it took away from the whole show and was distracting.  It would be so much easier if the audience could tip them at the end versus during the actual show.  The food was great - I especially enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros, Egg Whites, Fruit, and sausage.  The service was stellar - very attentive staff.  The unlimited mimosas are fantastic!  Great value!  Tip - go on Groupon and purchase your ticket there.  You can save quite a bit of money.",

They have three levels of supposedly different genres. The top level was Spanish music. Not the fun and  upbeat kind you wanna wiggle and dance to. The kind you want to basically sit in your room and cry into your pillow. That's what I felt like doing and I don't even speak Spanish! I like live Mexican Banda as much as the next Hispanic (or Hispanic by association like myself) but come on!! It was beyond turn down.. Spent most of my time dancing with the girls in my party in the \"top 40/hip hop\" area.   Clientele could be described as lower class. It was dirty, small and the floors were sticky. Not very crowded either. There was a guy who puked on the bar. Two drunk girls fell on floor right at my feet and just laid there.. Like get tf up?? Looking around at everyone's faces no one really looked into it. Not even the drunk ones.   $22 a head after 11, (traffic on the strip made us late.) Not worth it. Ghetto & classless. Weak drinks. $35 for two half yard AMF's that barely gave me a buzz. $3 gummy bear shots that tasted like they had no alcohol.   GO WITH FUN PEOPLE and make the most of it just like I did. If not, and you're the type relying on a good buzz and good atmosphere to \"turn up\", I'll warn you now that you will not find that here. Wouldn't go back.",

Otherwise, I would give Senor Frogs of Las Vegas ZERO STARS.  Why?  They left off the sour cream on my enchiladas, they sat me at a table and I waited and waited for someone to bring me a menu and I never got one.  So, I got up and since I had noticed tables on the deck, I asked the hosts if I could have a table outside, but they told me \"the three empty tables on the deck do not have a server\" and basically insisted I could not sit on the deck.  So, I finally decided to just get my food to go.  Good thing the expensive cheese enchiladas actually had lots of cheese, or there'd be no stars.

We couldn't resist this offer and went with the VIP ticket via Groupon. VIP check in, bottomless Mimosas, open bar, buffet, photo op with the cast and of course the show. The cuisine was average, I do recommend maybe arriving a little early to the show to allow time to gather your food and drinks.  The performers are absolutely talented. Host was very entertaining and funny. Crowd was full of laughs and positive energy. Be sure to bring some singles to tip performers. Overall I would return and recommend to friends. Cheers!!!",

Playing video poker while waiting for food was fun, except I did notice the bar is not wiped and cleaned well.   It took our bartender awhile to come to us, but I understand it's hard to escape when another customer on the other side of the table wants to tell his whole life story.  Anyway.... We got the: 1. fish tacos  2. chicken burrito  Yes! We could have probably saved $$ if went to a regular taco place, but it's the casino. What do you expect?   Fish tacos were actually bomb and I actually wanted more of it.  Eat it with Cholula sauce if u get it.  The chicken burrito was underwhelming. There were a lot more rice than chicken, but it will definitely fill you up.  Recommend it, if you like QUANTITY over Quality!  Located inside Treasure Island! Sitting at the table looks more fun than sitting at the bar. Good choice of alcohol! Moderate amount of patience needed!",

So she chose this as one of the activities to celebrate her 21st birthday in Las Vegas.   A group of us gals bought tickets via groupon. You need to redeem both the ticket & groupon voucher there at the venue so make sure you have it (or on your phone). VIP's do not need to wait in the very long line.  So I highly recommend the VIP tix --- no waiting in line, you receive priority seating, unlimited alcohol at the bar in addition to unlimited mimosas, and their buffet. The buffet had many choices, such as waffles, eggs, bacon, cheese omelets, yogurt, tamales, taquitos, juices, coffee, etc.   All of the performances were amazing & the show had great energy.  The host (dressed in red here in this pic) was my FAVE--very funny & so entertaining!!!   The only thing we missed out on was the photo op that was included in our package.   I would definitely go back to see this show again, you will LOVE IT!!! Thanks again!",

A party of 8 next to us left after complaining about the same things I listed.  Sent an email to Management, response I received-  Thank You for coming to the Big Game. We did give away prizes and our Djs started right when the game was over. Seating was first come in the section that you picked out also we let everyone know to come early so your group could sit together. Everyone had a great time and everyone enjoyed it.  Thank You, Denny  Not True Denny, it was a joke and people were not happy. We just had to laugh together because it was that pathetic and we were already there.  I was early that is how I know the food was out and unattended from 1 pm until 8 pm.  We went outside your restaurant and brought our own food in just so we could eat. Also tried warming it up ourselves with the portable heaters and your staff laughed!",

We were recommended here for Latin night but I guess we mistaken the day and went on a Sunday instead of a Saturday.   No Spanish music but we definitely had a blast.  Small cover charge for guys.  The DJ was amazing and played majority hip hop, some pop and reggaeton here and there.  We drank, danced, met some people... just a fun ambience all around. Server never came to our table to get our drink order but no big deal because the bar was accessible and the bartender was fast.  Definitely going back next time we are in Vegas.... can't wait to sit in the patio area and enjoy strip view.   P.S. I loved the quotes on the ceiling -  so many good ones!!!",

    "text": "We visited Senor Frogs this weekend with friends for Cinco de Mayo and just knew it would be a great time! So when we approached the bar and noticed 2 for 1 drink specials, it made the night even better. As we arrived, our friends (who had been previously waiting) were just being seated. Rather than order inside, we decided to order our yard-style drinks before coming in. I clarified with the bartender what drinks were 2 for 1, she said all of them.   I said great, we'll take two of these size (pointing to the 22oz containers for $24 directly on the menu) and picked the flavors. She quickly made the drinks, served them and I handed her my credit card. As I handed her my card, she took it quickly and said that would be $35...  Whoa, even will a full tip our order wouldn't be $35. I attempted to call out to her as she stepped to the side to do the transaction. Excuse me, ma'am...   excuse me, ma'am.... She didn't hear me. She came back over with my copy to fill out and I asked her, weren't these supposed to be $24? She then goes on to say, no the $35 ones are 2 for 1. I replied that's not what she JUST said a few minutes ago, reminding her that I even pointed to the actual size I wanted on the physical menu so she had a visual confirmation of what I ordered. She claims she didn't hear me.   Strange, she got the flavors right, though.  The gentlemen next to us at the bar even corroborated my story when they heard our conversation with her.   I asked if she could make the adjustment and this is not what we wanted. Her response was that they didn't even have the size we ordered (strange, considering they were on the menu and I pointed at them) AND again said that only the $35 and higher drinks were 2 for 1... THEN ASKED (with an attitude) IF WE WANTED HER TO TAKE THE DRINKS BACK AND BE CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR TWO SMALLER DRINKS, which would have come to more than the $35 she JUST charged me. Seriously? This is how guests are treated at Senor Frogs? Nooo... not the Senor Frogs I know of. But it was... really happening. Frustrated, I said you know what... no, we came to have fun. We'll keep the drinks if you're going to be difficult about owning up to YOUR mistake. I signed the receipt with ZERO tip and we joined our party inside.   When we got in, our enjoyment was completely leveled out. The fun atmosphere we came to enjoy wasn't enjoyable. We didn't even want to order food anymore as we felt we'd just been ripped off and essentially told to deal with it. At that point, I asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to the manager on duty and told her the situation. After defending her bartender's mistake, she scripted an insincere apology (Robotically, \"LET-ME-SAY-I'M SORRY-ABOUT-THE-INCONVENIENCE.\") and again offered to TAKE THE DRINKS BACK and offer a full refund.   Think about that....   Her bartender makes a mistake, she fakes an apology and then destroys inventory (because obviously she had an attitude as well) and doesn't even attempt to satisfy the guests needs. We never asked for free drinks... we just wanted to pay for what we asked for or to be offered a reasonable exchange.  It was more or less, I'm giving you a f***ing refund, give me my drinks back.  Just here's your refund, bye. She didn't even offer to order another drink for us, or say we'll take the drinks back and just apply the funds to your dinner tonight that you're about to order... nothing.   We wanted to have drinks,  order food and enjoy our night. That was the plan. Our night was effectively ruined by the staff that evening. The bartender, Lila, (check number 773174) and her manager need definite lessons on guest service standards.",

We started off with the 2 for 1 Yard Sticks drinks, but at $40 it didn't feel like much of deal since they were mostly filled with ice and juice.  Food wise, we ended up trying a burrito, fish tacos, the tortilla soup.  The burrito wasn't bad, the fish tacos were just ok and the tortilla soup I believe was suppose to have some chicken in there but didn't.  The most disappointing thing was it will cost you for chips and salsa at this place.  Overall, overpriced Mexican food but a decent atmosphere.",

After waiting for over an hour, we thought this was going to be spectacular but NOPE. A bunch of round, broken down, 2x4 chairs and tables that look like they were made in a garage in Tijuana. $$$ 9 bucks for a beer, bottle or pour is outrageous!! The food was OK at best and extremely overpriced. Chicken nachos for $20 bucks that had very few pieces of chicken on it at all. We requested no sour cream but of course, a large nasty pile of it when the order arrived. The server said he can't split a check more than 3 ways so we would just have to figure it out. He was just a lazy guy. The place was loud, obnoxious and just not a nice place to go to. Never waste your money on this place.",

Perks: They held a raffle at the time we were playing tourists. Winners won a 5 day trip to Cancun :) I think it was five days. When there aren't so many diners and maybe someone spends $20 on raffles - a better chance of winning.  Food: Overall okay. It's burgers and such. Pub kind of food. Liquor / bar of course - you're on the Strip and Treasure Island Resort.  Service: Nice people. Checked on us. Offered mayo for fries. Highlighted specials. Those tall tube drinks omgosh! Was the first one I've tried.  Deco: If you drink enough you might be inclined to want to read everything on the ceiling hahahaaa! Go check out the outside bar where it's a swimming pool seen; from a unique perspective :P",

FIRST OF ALL where in Baja do they use flour tortillas. The fish was like a fish stick. There was no crema, or salsa on it. The chips were fake and their salsa was pace picante plus we had to pay for the chips and salsa. I will never come here again.  Also there was a chair being held together by tape, and although our waitress was nice and apologized our drinks took a long time, couldn't even finish half before the food came.  Definitely not worth what paid even for Vegas. We've had buffet food way better than this",

Overall thoughts? Good drinks, party environment, and very \"meh\" food.   Service  We made a reservation (probably a good idea on busy nights) and were seated right away. Our server (I wish we got her name...) was really great. Fun and casual but not crazy or full of lame jokes. She got our drink and food order whenever we were ready and got the bill quickly when we were done. They had another worker passing through making balloon hats for everyone (no extra charge). She made some pretty amazing balloon creations!  No pressure, however, if you decided not to wear hot air on your head. They were selling raffle tickets that night (and based on Yelp this seems common). I think it was 7 tickets for $20 to win a trip to Cancun. They seem to do a drawing every one and a half to two hours or so. You're only competing with other patrons in the restaurant, so potentially the odds aren't too bad (we bought them but aren't heading south of the border anytime soon).   Ambiance Basic bar environment. High chairs and tables generally. Fairly comfortable. Lots of whimsical jokes and puns decorate the ceiling. It wasn't too loud when we were there (Sunday night). They have a stage for live music (none when we were there). It was on the noisy side but still easy to have a conversation.   Food Tried the wings, spinach dip, ribs, chicken tacos, and churros. The ribs were the highlight - tender and flavorful with seasoned fries. Otherwise the food was very average. The food menu is actually fairly limited in terms of selection. We had two rounds of assorted cocktails too. Their cocktail menu is extensive!  Tons of mixed and frozen drinks and all different sizes to choose from. They were having a buy one get one free on the largest size drinks I believe (about $35 each). The frog's punch was really good as was the daiquiri. Don't expect garnishes or fancy glasses; plastic cups are the standard here. The drinks were very tasty!!  For very average bar food it is not cheap. Our total with four of the smallest size cocktails, two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert was about $122 before tip. We did have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate which knocked $50 off that.   Mojo Overall a fun environment with an extensive selection of cocktails which are tasty but very average and expensive food. I guess after a few of the cocktails you don't notice the food. Good place to go if your focus is drinking with some snacks to keep the booze from going to your head too fast.",

Loud hip hop music, dayglow art, with black lights, large screens with sports games.   This is how the convo went. Stands up front, smiles at the hostess. /blank stare from hostess \"Hello!\" /blank stare from hostess \"Hi, we'd like a table for two!\" /smile blank stare from hostess for 5 seconds She finally talks, \"What?\" \"Table for two please.\" /smile /blank stare again, 5 seconds. \"A table?\" \"Yes, please a table for two.\" Stares again for 5 seconds. \"Do you have a reservation?\" (Sunday at 4pm btw) \"Nope, no reservation.\" She responds, \"Ok ok, hold on.\" slight annoyed look, hits headset, \"hey, do we have a table for two?\" \"Oh wait, inside or outside.\" \"Inside please\" \"Oh I don't know, let me see\" After about 2 minutes, \"Yeah, we have one.\"  The whole place is empty!! (one other table, few people at the bar) What the?!  We ask the waitress for two drink specials, 10oz. She brings the yard long margarita bong. GF asks, \"Wait, these are the 10oz?\" Waitress, \"Yes, they are\" We order food and ask the waitress which apps we can get for the bogo deal, \"Can we get nachos and and a quesadilla on the deal?\" She replies, \"Yes, those two are part of the deal.\"  Order chips and salsa, argh. Brown bag chips and canned salsa for $5. Totally low quality.  Order apps, bogo deal 2:1 at 50%. Nachos were ok, quesadilla was a brick of cheese inside a tortilla.  Bill comes full charge on everything, including $40 drinks, not the 10oz, waitress totally lied.    Most offensive part, we ordered some top shelf drinks, they totally pulled a fast one with the booze, and put bottom shelf in it. Thought such an establishment wouldn't pull that old trick. Sorry, not some dumb college kid that can't tell the difference. Watery too.  Yeah, terrible service, full price on everything during happy hour, waitress straight out lied, hostess was high as a kite, bar served us bottom shelf yet paid for top, and unbelievably expensive even for Strip prices. Oh almost forgot, getting water and refills at the table was apparently a herculean task. Pass on this place.",

I took my group of six (4 adults and two kids) for a late lunch and the manager, Marchan, seated us promptly, gave us special cups and wristbands and the waitress, Denis, got all of our drink and food orders quickly.  The drinks were pretty good, I like frozen margaritas, and the food was pretty tasty with large portions.  I had their carnitas tacos and received three large, well filled tacos containing tasty seasoned pork.  My oldest ordered a nacho dish which was huge and covered with lots of tasty stuff!  My lovely wife had a taco salad which was also huge and well made.  Brenda made sure we had all the drinks we wanted with some ordering more than one!  Overall, a great experience for me and the family...recommended.",

Once we were finally seated the waitress came over and took our drink order right away (good). 20 minutes later and we got to order our food. The food is the only reason this place even gets one star. It was very good! Not $18 for nachos good but good. Surprisingly. Place looks very run down as well. My friend got a refill on her water After the 4th time of trying to get the attention of our waitress. She only had 3 tables too. Come on now. Not worth the price or the time. Go to any other place on the strip. This place is terrible. I'll never go back or go to another senor frogs for that matter.   Also while we were leaving a bouncer asked us if we had gotten our stamps to which we were like no we're not staying he asked why and we replied \"because the service was terrible\" at this point you would have thought he would have gotten a manager to resolve the issue before it left the restaurant ( which is the right thing to do ) instead we walked away while he stood, astonished and speechless",

DECOR: Its a typical bar and bar atmosphere. Wasnt too loud when we went, but still there was noise. There are some funny signs on the ceiling with different funny sayings. Even the decor is \"loud\" but what can u expect in Vegas right??  FOOD: Food was pretty good. My friend and I had the BBQ Combo which was really good. Another friend had the Beef Fajitas which was good too, but BEWARE they charge u to get more tortillas, lame! The portions are good to share as well.   DRINKS: All of us got two drinks that come in thos big containers shaped like a palm tree. Was good enough for the six of us and taste wise was good.  SERVICE: Our waitress was nice but not overly friendly and not as attentive as she could have been. Overall she was nice though.   Overall it was a good experience and I would go back, but at the same time it won't be at the top of my list either, just when we are in the area.",

Let me first say that my drink was too strong to be close to enjoyable. It was a truly disgusting drink and I can honestly say I've never had anything worse.  Next, my friend's pina colada was in the same condition, though in a smaller cup. She asked if the bartender could fix it, and he added something - not sure what, to sweeten it and it tasted the exact same. He had a bit of an attitude about it and eventually she just got a beer and the awful concoction she had was thrown out.  I might give this place a try for their food next time, but never again will I order anything but a beer (you can't screw that up). Though chances are I'll never be back all together.",

Thank goodness we sat outside, now I did go during spring break, so for party crowd this is the place to be.  They had a DJ bringing up peeps on the stage for competitions for free shots.  They had great LOUD music playing.  This was also a stop for all the party buses.  If you are worried about the noise or family with kids, don't be.  We were fine sitting outside, my little ones and I enjoyed it.",

I'll take a job there, lol I guess they don't believe in multitasking.  Then our $17.99 chicken quesdill came out, cheese was hard and cold, tortilla was hard and dry, we ordered 2 only got 1 thank goodness because they were horrible, the only thing that was good were the margaritas, little to much ice but the taste was good.  Food was way to expensive, maybe the have to charge that amount to pay those cooks who make $30 an hour, lol. Will never go back, server was nice, not her fault, food sucked. I'll find somewhere else to take my family,   Like casa flores in Boulder city, now that's an awesome place for Mexican food, we just happened to be in the treasure island that's why we went to senior frogs. Best food in Boulder city, casa flores, don't waste your time in senior frogs..",

Additionally, when you're cheap in Vegas, as I am, and you're slipping whiskey into your coke under the table, they do not notice...or at least didn't make a fuss if they did.  Beyond that, the food was just not great. I'm not very picky but I got the fish tacos and they just didn't do it for me. They had a weird corn-coleslaw thing as opposed to lettuce and avocado and the usual fish taco stuff and it just wasn't good. My boyfriend got a burger that I had a few bites of. Better than my fish tacos but as I'm not a huge burger fan I can't say much more than that.  Overall, just okay. With the many food options in Vegas, I don't think I'll be coming back unless it's for the drinks...which, while I didn't have any, it seemed like there were some good deals.",

We ate here for dinner because my friends wanted to check it out. The night we went was mostly dead because I think it was a Wednesday. The food was good but nothing to write home about.  We already tried The Yard in Myrtle Beach so we stuck to water. Eventually we reminded ourselves that we were in Las Vegas and needed to man up so we searched for the shot girl we saw walking around earlier. She was nowhere to be found and we had to flag down our waiter, who brought over a round. What he brought were these mixed shots/shooters, which were tasty, but there was definitely not much alcohol in it. So much for manning up. We got another round just because and then the waiter gave us the next two rounds after that for free. I would not have gotten more otherwise because it simply wasn't worth paying for. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and able to keep conversation. Even his awkward flirting was entertaining.  While all this was going on, we were watching a group of British men being aggressively accosted by a birthday girl and her friends in the bar area and dance floor. The guys were visibly uncomfortable but they all left together so I guess that turned out okay. We had to sit through a few cover songs by a cheesy, awful band. Thankfully we got there as their set was finishing up. A little later all the servers got up on stage to do some type of line dance which was fun to watch.  I think the prices were about the same as they were in Myrtle Beach, but this time around I wasn't sticker-shocked. This is probably due to the fact that I already experienced Senor Frog's before and/or was used to paying Vegas prices.",

It was full of people having a midlife crisis and a few nerds attempting to be the next Tucker Max.

Not at the bar, not at the tables near the bar, not at the tables on the patio. It's spring break season, where are the staff? After 30 minutes (2x the original wait time), we left and went somewhere else. We'd been seated, gotten drinks, and ordered food at the other restaurant when I got a text that our table was ready.

That sounded reasonable to us so we did what we had to do. Well we end up back here at 10:15pm hungry thinking the kitchen would be open. Turns out they had already closed the kitchen.

And they charge guy I think 22 bucks to get in which my guy friends were not very happy about, besides that I didnt know what to expect, but it was nothing but a good time! The view of the strip when you go onto the outside patio/deck is super cool! If your a tourist check this place out if you want a drunken night full of drinks and good vibes!",

But seriously, stay away at all costs. Waste of time and money. We get there and order or food & drinks. The juice we got was WATERED DOWN. never have I gotten watered down juice in my life. Look, its already over priced because it's Vegas, but you're gonna try and be cheap and water down your drinks too? .. actually, maybe that's how theyr'e staying in business, by changing the quality of all their food with shortcuts.   I ask them if I can change the pineapple juice to orange juice, cause hey, what if it's just that juice? Nope. Same result. 45 minutes later our food arrives. Nothing looks fresh, or appetizing. The beans tasted like canned beans. My friend had to order something completely different because she couldn't even eat her food. So she got a salad, since it's pretty hard to screw up a salad. I got a Burger which I asked for medium well and of course got well done. The bun was hard as a rock, I was able to knock on it.. The fries did not taste very fresh, like the oil's never been changed.   Do yourself a favor, save your money and appetite and take it elsewhere.",

I'm a local and I eat out a lot, all over the town. The only reason I stayed there after I've seen the drinks ($11 cocktails were actually melted frozen drinks in small plastic cups, and the $8.50 small draft beer) just because I had to get rid of the $50 coupon.

The staff did not seem that friendly at first so as we waited I checked the Yelp reviews and saw that the reviews were not so good.

The waitress was not that friendly but she wasn't that rude either, she ended up warming up towards the end. The food was good actually, I really liked the chicken nachos but the carne asada tacos I wouldn't order again. I tried my friends shrimp quesadilla and that was good too and the margarita wasn't bad. The atmosphere was really cool and they have a ballon lady that can make any type of ballon hat (for free but we tipped of course). Overall cool spot, very pricey, decent food but it's a one time stop for me. I",

The place wasn't busy at all but the service said otherwise! We waited sooooo long for our food. We ordered the chicken burrito ($18) and the fish tacos ($18) and a side of fries ($3). We chose the nachos for the free appetizer. My friend enjoyed her fish tacos but my chicken burrito was very bland and hardly any guacamole. The appetizer took the longest to come out and was terrible. The meals came out about 15 min after the appetizers came out and they forgot the side of fries. The side of fries came out once we were finished with our meals. The food was extremely overpriced especially for the taste. The drinks are even more overpriced but this is on the strip so no surprise. Wouldn't come back here, not worth the price or wait at all. Our server on the other hand was extremely sweet.",

I expected to pay a premium on food because of the location on the strip so I hoped the food would deliver.  I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap after the server said they are huge.  What I got was not huge, but I figured whatever, this is no Hash House A Go Go! :)  I don't know if the wrap was supposed to be warm or cold, because different parts were warm (like the chicken), but the lettuce and sauce was ice cold.  Also as I got to both ends of my half-cut wrap, the end was just a ton of sauce with no chicken, not really the best way to end the meal.  On the other hand the fries and chips and salsa were really good, so that was a plus. (I believe we had to pay for the chips though)  I don't have much of a reason to come back here, I can get a bigger and better sandwich somewhere else for half the price.  I'm sure you can do worse, but you can do a lot better on the strip for the same price point.",
