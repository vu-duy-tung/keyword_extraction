Not only is the space comfortable & stylish, we were greeted & seated within a few minutes on a busy Sunday night. We started with the Paradise Salad, which immediately impressed each of us. My hubby & I eat a lot of Thai food - we had never had a salad like this before. Absolutely delicious! The tom kha soup and pad see yu were gobbled up but then the green curry arrived. Best green curry I've ever had. Even my friends honey, who is not normally a lover of Thai food, gave Thailicious a big thumbs up. Good value, great service & fantastic food. We'll be back!",

I will give them another try since there were many things to try on their menu and the service was agood.",

    "text": "Hello, and welcome to Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan. We have not had Thai food in a long while and I had seen some great YELP reviews so we decided to venture away from our normal eating habits in the area and try this lovely restaurant. We arrived and it was swarming with people and the place was buzzing. We got one of the last seats at a small table and were given menus and had our drink order taken. You can tell this was going to be an excellent meal by how busy it was and many seemed to be regulars. The wait staff was quite personable with the guests and we looked forward to ordering. We went with a simple plan of a thai beef jerky appetizer, sticky rice, Chicken Pad Thai, and Pork fried Rice. The Jerky was actually more tender than expected from previous bad experiences at other Thai spots. There was a slightly spicy marinade and a very spicy dipping sauce. Not sure what was in it but it was yummy. The Pad Thai was also ordered to a not spicy feel. Thinly sliced noodles with bits of egg, bean sprouts and green onions. Crispy sprouts and flavor filled noodles that I was gobbling up like it was my last meal. The Pork rice was relatively standard and quite filling and a good portion.I did like how the flavored the pork with a sour following taste after the initial bit. Sort of a Pork adobo  feel.  I must also mention a portion of the menu has a fully Vegan area to it. Unsure if the Vegan is prepared wholly separate or not. However the selection was vast in comparison to most Vegan selections. I guess with Vegan in your title you better deliver.  Thank you for dining at Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan. We took our stuff to go since we had so much  left over, and it was just as good the next day. We will  be visiting again. amazing food with a great convenient location in our favorite city of Henderson. Check them out first chance you get. One of the best Thai food places I have been to.",

    "text": "Finally tried this place yesterday with my mom and it was THAILICIOUS. lol. We got the Golden Tofu, Vegan drumsticks, Tom Yum Veggie and Som Tam (all from the Vegan menu). The Soy drumsticks were amazing. The skewer stick inside cracked me up as it resembled the bone, but my son was like \"wow...taste and looks like chicken\". Some non vegans like to troll and ask why we eat stuff that taste like meat if we don't eat meat, and the obvious answer is because we like the taste without the guilt.  The Tom yum was great and I was skeptical because it taste like fish sauce was in there. (that's a good thing if there was no fish sauce but still tasted like it) because I was a fish sauce addict. I am more of a laos som tam type of person but since going vegan, I am still completely satisfied with this vegan version and absolutely love that they put string beans in there. I ordered shrimp pad thai for my son and he loved it as well. Can't wait to come by again and try the vegan jerky and a few other things.  Owners- If you read this, I'm not sure if you saw my message on FB, but check into the Mushroom soysauce from asian markets, for a fish sauce substitute in case vegetarians or vegans want it instead of fish sauce. Like instead of pik nampa.",

(I'm cringing lol)  My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a shot since he's vegan. Walking in, I already found the place very comforting and cute. The cups, table setting and the menus were pretty neat. It didn't feel like a typical casual thai food restaurant. The price was similar to every other place. Which is good! I thought it'd be more expensive because it's vegan. But asides from that, the food was delicious! I fell in love with everything I ordered. The vegan tom kha (idk if i spelt it right lol) soup was my favorite part! I have never enjoyed tom kha soup so much from the other thai places I've been too. You have to try if you're a big fan of sour soup and coconut milk! Besides that, my boyfriend and I also enjoyed their avocado curry. He didn't ask for any spice, but there was a slight kick to it! Which made it even better. Keep in mind, they also have lunch specials starting 11am until 2pm! Lunch specials are the typical pad thai, pad see ew, etc.  What makes this place even better? The service! The staff did a pretty great job at checking up on us, recommending stuff on the menu, and making sure the food was on point!",

They have a separate vegan menu, so this made me really excited. I ordered the papaya salad, the avocado curry, and basil fried rice at a number 8 spice to go. Everything came out delicious. I've never had an avocado curry before and It was really interesting. They are able to do the fried rice with brown rice upon request. They don't have alcohol, beer, or wine yet.   Definitely the best Thai I've had in that area of Henderson. I'll definitely be back:)",

    "text": "Love thai food and wanted to give this fast causal place a try! Gotta say I'm a fan.   Place is kept up well. Service was fast and friendly. Food portions are generous and the prices are comparable to thai restaurants. They have a pretty large menu so there is plenty to choose from.   Between two people we ordered crabmeat fried rice, panna chicken curry and thai noodles. Didn't even come close to finishing anything. All dishes were flavorful and good. Also had the wonton soup, the cup was good for two people to have as a starter.   For dessert, I love mango sticky rice. Many thai places either run out or mango is hardly in season so they don't have it. I was surprised to see that they did and it was so darn good. The sticky rice is purple so don't be alarmed, it tasted just like any other sticky rice you've had before.   Overall, I think we found our new local thai spot and will be back for more.",

The location is very upscale and clean. The men's restroom was immaculate and no paper towels or wet spots on the floor around the urinals.  I have this thing about checking a business's (men's) restroom-This is an area to me that should be second only to the kitchen that should always be in order. There's was a 9.5 !!!  My family of six tried the Tom Kha soup, sticky rice, drunken noodles, Thai ice tea, Thai coffee, pineapple fried rice, Pad Thai.   The dishes were served hot and with peanut butter dipping sauce that was sooooooo good I almost broke down and cried .Their seasoning was not too loud but made you crave for more of each bite.  I just wish I could have proposed to the chef on the spot.  The servers were very attentive and the orders were brought out promptly one after the other.  I really can't say enough about the quality of the food and service.  This is a spot absolutely not to be missed...an excellent Thai food treat!!!  We shall return",

    "text": "I was really excited for this place to open up, as I had been a fan of Komol for years. The first time I came here the service was really bad, a few of the staff didn't speak very good English and they were confused on basic requests of mine like asking for a glass of water. English is my second language as well, so I am certainly not faulting anyone for not speaking the language. But if your job is to take food orders, I do think it is pretty important that you understand the language. Ordering was very difficult.  Food came out warm not hot, and the taste was mediocre. Second time I came here the service was much better, the food was still just mediocre at best.  I know it's the same recipes as the older's uncle's restaurant but for some reason I liked the other place much better. Maybe this place is just too trendy for me and not warm or inviting enough. I guess it just doesn't feel that comfortable inside, maybe it's the seats, maybe it's the vibe itself. I just know what I have been to plenty of amazing Thai restaurant over the years and had a great meal. Both times that I've dined here I have not felt that way.  The environment feels kind of sterile.  And with the food just being mediocre at the pricing not being particularly great or different than any other Thai restaurant, I see no reason why I would choose to come here over any other place. Sorry, thailicious, you just haven't won me or my family over.",

The meat had black grill marks. I thought the chicken was freshly sliced and then stir fried not grilled with the broccoli in a oyster sauce. I told the waitress to take it off from the bill, because I didn't care for it. The waitress did take off the broccoli dish from the  bill after consulting with the manager. When i left I could see they weren't happy about it. So, I am giving 2 stars instead of 3, because a restaurant should understand not every dish will be cooked perfectly, and customers do return dishes if they didn't like it.",

Crabclaws, squid and shrimp on a mound of seasoned noodles. I wanted Angel wings but they were not available so we got the lettuce wraps. The wraps were not what we expected but they all got eaten. Dinner was finished off with chocolate cheesecake and green tea ice cream. can't wait to go back.....soon!! Did I mention how hospitable and friendly the staff was!  If not..... They are TOPS!!",

I am vegan so when I saw that this restaurant had vegan options I had to try it out.  The staff on the other hand was not friendly at all. No one took my order until I flagged someone down. After my food was delivered, no one came by to check on me the entire time. Thankfully I had my own water in my purse because no one refilled my water until after I received my check, and was about to leave. I asked a server for my check and she forgot so I had to sit there with my kid who was getting fussy because we had already ate and were just sitting and waiting at that point.  The restaurant did not seem overly busy while I was there, and it seemed to be heavily staffed so I don't know why there wasn't more attentive service or pleasentness, but the food will definitely be bringing me back..... TO GO!",

Also get the butterfly pea juice! It's magical.  This restaurant is super far from me but I don't mind making the drive for this food and service it's totally 100% worth it.

So if you get there at 8:30 they turn you around  they tell you that they going to close soon. Any other place that I been to, they want your business so they accommodate you. Usually if they close at certain time, they won't take you after that time or just a few minutes before. This place seems like everyone leaves by 9:00 pm on Sundays, cooks, dishwashers, waiters, cashiers. I don't think I'll ever comeback to this place.",

We ordered the yellow curry with shrimp and the tom yum soup with shrimp. The yellow curry was delicious, I've had yellow curry many times all over and this is in the top 3! The consistency, the flavor, the big chunks of potatoes and carrots, just everything is perfect. The Tom yum soup was also amazing, it had so much flavor and was the perfect weapon to combat an oncoming cold. We ordered it spicy but even though we were dying we couldn't stop eating haha it was so good! Last we ordered the mango and sticky rice. Just wow. Not many places know how to make the sticky rice like this place and the fact that they bring it out on a wooden with a beautiful flower just made it that much better.   Experience: So good! Funny story, one of use accidentally spilled our soup all over ourselves and the staff ran to grab napkins and towels to help clean us up but first asking if we were ok! They even offered to replace our bowl of soup. Exceptional customer service for sure! They kept an eye on us and kept our drinks refilled at all times. The owner came and talked to us after our meal and told us a little more about the restaurant which was so sweet.   Location: It's in the shopping center right next to the freeway and easy to find. It's a decent sized restaurant with about 10 tables if I remember correctly. Everything is nice and clean and new.   Come check them out! I can't wait to come back with more friends.",

Just love how the flavors pop out on all their dishes.   Five stars for having an awesome, delicious and affordable 6.99 special during the lunch hours. Good variety of entrees offered and generous portions. Word of mouth has spread fast and it's super busy during these times but quick turnaround, and haven't had to wait to be seated.  Inviting ambiance. Natural lighting. Spacious dining area has clean modern look.   It's primarily table service style restaurant, so wait to be seated and  pay at end of your meal.   Service is great now! In the beginning they were overwhelmed, slow and orders were forgotten, but forgivable, being it was during the first week, but the staff has been very welcoming, efficient, and always smiling. They know their regulars. So much so, they have my favorite drink, Butterfly Pea Lemongrass juice out to my table as soon as we're seated.  Love this neighborhood restaurant!

Plenty of people were coming and going with take out orders too.  The inside of the restaurant is clean with a bit of a modern feel. Seating is comfortable with a mix of tables and partial booths. A large menu gives plenty of options to choose from. Pricing is reasonable and makes this an inexpensive meal option. My husband joked that this was his new favorite restaurant when he saw the check at the end of the meal. Service was more someone taking our order and dropping off meals as they were ready. We didn't see much of our server, but maybe it was just a busy night.  My husband and I shared Chicken Pad Thai and Thailicious Fried Rice. Our favorite of the two was the Thailicious Fried Rice which had a great flavor with a nice amount of vegetables in the mix. The rice had both chicken and large pieces of shrimp. The Chicken Pad Thai was also good, but not the best I've had. With such a large menu I'd probably try something different next time.",

The restaurant and employees were great but when i got home with our order i couldn't help but be disappointed by the flavor.   Garlic black pepper beef - This dish had cilantro on it which wasn't listed on the menu or i would have ordered it without and i couldn't taste any garlic or black pepper... maybe i got the wrong item?  1/5  Pork Pad se ew - better then the last dish but still, not a whole lot of flavor. 2/5  Sweet and sour chicken - This was good. Pretty unique with the way they cook it and good flavor. 4/5",

I chose the salad which has a choice of ginger or peanut dressing. The ginger dressing was tangy and refreshing. You can specify the spicy level on the curry 1-10. I got 1 which was spicy for me, but I have low tolerance for spice.   Ambiance: nicely decorated, clean restaurant.  Service: friendly and consistently fill water glasses.   Location: conveniently located in the same plaza as the mini golf right off the 215 off Stephanie. Plenty of parking shared in the plaza.",

I ordered the green curry at the recommendation of the worker since it is one of their popular signature dishes. The curry was delicious with a creamy texture that was packed with flavor. Nothing is more annoying than a curry that is diluted with water. Loved the veggies that added a fresh crunch factor and the beef was tasty as well. The curry wasn't spicy either so don't worry too much about that if you cannot handle spicy foods.  Overall I would recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't done so yet. I'd say it's on the same level as Penn's Thai House and way better than Gata. I'll be back here to try it more dishes and will update my review accordingly.",

I am by no means vegan and I am not the biggest fan of Thai food but I sure do love places that are nice, close, cheapish, and new so I had to try it.  Went with my mother and we adored the placce.  It was super clean and well decorated although quite simple.  The staff were very friendly and we were seated right quickly.  The food smelled amazing and I began salivating as soon as I sat down.  I ordered the Drunken pork noodles and my mother got the beef pad thai, both of which were very tasty.  I got mine with a 6/10 spiciness and that was just right although when I go back (because I definitely will) I will order a 7/10.  I really want to try the curries and honestly most things on the menu.  I'm actually kind of excited typing this even though I just went only a few hours ago.  Go and try this place and keep going back so we can keep good, family run, unique dining options open and available in Henderson!",

Like another thai spot in town that I am quite fond of, Thailicious has an ample menu that offers both vegan and non-vegan options. I have tried dishes off both parts of the menu and everything has been phenomenal. My personal favorites are the Paradise Salad and the Butterfly Pea Lemonade.  Located in the same plaza as EOS Gym on Stephanie, Thailicious is not large but I have never had to wait to be seated (both for weekend lunch and weekday dinners). It's very clean and decorated beautifully.  Service is extremely friendly and attentive, drinks are refilled often and an employee even went out of his way to open the door for me as I left on my last visit.   Thailicious is much more accessible to me compared to some other places I enjoy in town... add the location to the taste of the dishes and the service received, and it's become my current favorite Thai spot in the Las Vegas area.",

    "text": "I normally don't feel compelled to write reviews but wow. Seriously...wow. Thai food has never been a favorite kind of food for me because despite it being \"pretty good\" most of the time, it's never wowed me. That changed today! I've been waiting for this place to open up for the longest time and let me tell you, the wait was definitely worth it! The owners are complete sweethearts and you can tell that they took their time with the restaurant, making sure everything was top notch and put their hearts and souls into their food.   I ordered the Duck Panang Curry and Vegan Veggie Rolls. Both were absolutely incredible and bursting with flavor. Curry is a comfort food for me and their curry was honestly, the BEST I've had out of Indian, Japanese and Thai curry. Decadent and rich, with just the right amount of coconut and spice. The vegetables were still crisp and the duck had amazing flavor and texture that complimented the vegetables and curry beautifully. Rolls were also delicious; fresh and came with a peanut and a hot and sour sauce.   If that wasn't enough to entice you to go, their customer service is phenomenal! I was offered a water while waiting for my food, which I really appreciated. Employees made small talk and were very friendly. There's truly something for everyone here, whether you're looking for vegan and vegetarian cuisine or something with meat. Give this place a try! You will not be disappointed. I look forward to coming here frequently.",

I had to get up and ask if he noticed my name on the list because others that came after me were being seated. So we finally got a table for lunch. Next they took orders from everyone and appeared to be avoiding our table that was odd. That was it even others took note why we weren't being served. Yes we got up and left. My husband and I just wanted a good Thai lunch. Never had a problem on Eastern  \"Pin Kaow Thai\" there food is excellent. and does not have issues servicing Black Americans.

Had both types spring rolls, crab Rangoon, and veg fried rice... all totally delicious. This place doesn't disappoint, I encourage you to decide on this place and not any other in Henderson.

    "text": "Very very good Thai! We went for the lunch special; $6.99 for an entree, spring roll, and soup or salad. You can't beat that price. Now, with that being said, the spring roll and salad wasn't anything special. The salad comes with two options for sauce; peanut or ginger. The peanut sauce was good, maybe a little too sweet, while the ginger sauce was the better choice.  Food - the group ordered red curry, panang curry, and pad thai. Everyone liked the flavor of their dish. The portions were very reasonable for the price!  I usually order a level 3 on the spice scale when the scale is 1-5. However, the spice scale at Thailicious is 1-10. I went a little more mild and ordered a 4. It was quite warm but not overpowering! Someone else in the party does not like heat, so they went with a 3. Nope! That was not a 3! Maybe the employee played a little prank on us, but it was warmer than the 5 that was ordered! Maybe we are all just weak, but it was very warm. Just know that the scale is warmer than all other places I have been.   Verdict - If you like Thai, give Thailicious a try!",

    "text": "Thailicious is a small, out of the way restaurant tucked into a strip mall. On weekends they fill up fast! The good news is that they are setup to turn tables quickly so you don't wait very long. They also do a brisk take out service. They have a sign-in sheet when you come in and wait for seating so make sure you go up to the front counter when you come in.  Onto the food. The menu is small but they have a really good selection with a lot of vegan options. This is nice because it can be hard to find a restaurant that fits everyone's dietary needs. The menu is setup to have base dishes and you customize the meat. There's a few chinese dishes on the menu as well. All the ingredients taste and look fresh. They also last in the fridge well when you take the leftovers home. Here's a tip: you can tell a restaurant is using old food if the take out goes stale/looks icky after 1 or 2 days in the fridge.  We had the yellow curry and the pad se ew. The curry's flavors were very good and the sauce is filled with potatos and carrots. The only dings that I would give them is that the potatoes are a little too large and I like a thicker gravy in the curry.   The flat noodles in the pad se ew were fried perfectly and not greasy, as they've been in other restaurants where I've had this dish. It was slightly sweet but you can tone that down with the pepper sauces if you don't like that. If you can't tolerate really spicy food they tone the heat down without making the dishes bland and flavorless.  The only ding that I'd give them is that there are no tofu appetizers and they don't put out knives and spoons at the table settings. But these are minor grouses, we're glad we found this restaurant and will return.",

They have a full menu for vegan friendly options!!  For my family, we ordered their calamari, papaya salad, chicken pad see ew, Penang curry with tofu and eggplant basil with tofu. Every dish was a 5/5!   The calamari was seasoned very good and they paired with sweet chili sauce. The papaya salad was light and the perfect amount of crunch. Only downside is that it only comes with 2 shrimp. I didn't really eat the pad see ew but I did pick off some broccoli and those pieces were yummy! I don't eat curry, but that dish was finished between the other 3 in my group.. my brother, whose a recent vegetarian, said it was one of the best Penang curries he's had. And lastly, the eggplant basil... DELICIOUS. It was clearly my order, but I absolutely loveeeeed the way they prepared both the eggplant and tofu. Filled with lots of flavor! The curry and eggplant dish came with a side of rice, which we could care less for. Their thai coffee was also really good! I always order thai coffee in hopes it will be amazing, but it's never really good... BUT this thai coffee tasted so good, I finished all of mine and had sips from my moms. Hehe.  All in all, I literally can't wait to be back!!",

Located on the NW corner of Stephanie & Paseo Verde, it was easy to pop in for a To-go order.  I was able to try the Pineapple Fried Rice & the Pad Se Ew with beef.  The fried rice was such a large portion.  It's made with curry seasoning which I love.  It's combined with shrimp, chicken, onion, tomatoes, cashews and pineapple.  I wish I knew they topped it with cilantro.  Luckily it was easy to pick off.  Next time I will ask to leave that off.    The Pad Se -Ew with beef was delicious!  The dish consists of flat rice noodles with egg and broccoli in a soy sauce. When initially ordering, the lady asked what spice level I wanted.  I told her 7 but she looked at me like I was crazy.  She thought putting the spice on the side so we could add what we wanted was a better option.  Now this has happened at other Thai restaurants so you'd think I would be used to it.  I certainly spiced it up at home with the small container they included. Nonetheless, I would order this dish again!  There were a few little snafus but that won't stop me from coming back.",

    "text": "Location: Right in the middle of Henderson in one of the many strip malls  which line all of the main roads.   Venue: Fresh clean modern casual restaurant with waiter service and takeout available.  Large Menu:  Lunch Specials, vegetarian dishes, appetizers, desserts,  pho, and many assorted dishes including meats and curries found in most Thai restaurants. I would describe this as modern Thai with some other complimentary asian dishes. It has less focus on classic authentic Thai specialities.   We had the Massaman Tofu Curry, Roti Bread, crispy eggplant, beef and meatball noodle soup (pho like soup and noodles). They were all good but we just touched the surface of the menu. The lunch specials looked like good values.  Good food, vegetarian options, good service and fair prices. I'm a fan.

It's a small restaurant that will probably accommodate roughly 50 people. Staff was very friendly and attentive. They have a pretty decent menu that also offer Vegan entrees. They offer lunch specials too! We ordered their Thai beef jerky with sticky rice (not on the lunch menu). The beef jerky was well seasoned and tender. I got the pad Thai with chicken lunch special. It included, a small side salad with peanut butter dressing (YUM), spring roll and pad Thai. The pad Thai was a big portion and delicious. I ordered my spice level as a 7. I think it was the perfect spiciness. I had enough pad Thai to take home. That's how much they give you.",

    "text": "We have visited here twice. We ordered some takeout so I could take it to work, and the next day we ate in. For the takeout, I chose the lunch special for $6.99. You can choose from a bunch of different items as the entree, I got Pad Thai, and you also get one egg roll, and either a soup or salad. I got the soup which was the cucumber tofu soup. Mine was cold because I had it in the fridge before I was able to eat it, but it was still so good. Since it was cold it was refreshing and deliciously savory at the same. Pad Thai is my favorite, and they did not disappoint.   I ate the egg roll on the way to work and thought it was great. I think it's a pretty good deal for what you get. I also ordered summer rolls, another of my favorites for Thai food. It comes with two rolls cut in the middle and some yummy sauce for $4.99. They were both nice and full of veggies and shrimp. I thought the first one I bit into didn't have either the mint or maybe it was the basil spread out enough, but the second roll was more balanced. My hubby ordered a yellow curry, shrimp fried rice, drunken noodle, and egg rolls. I liked the fried rice the best out of all his entrees he ordered, but they all tasted great. While we were waiting for our order the owner, Dutch, was at the front and was chatting with my hubby. He gave me a sample of the Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Juice and I fell in love with it! It's a really cool blue drink that when you squeeze and mix the lemon juice in it'll turn purple. I thought that in itself was cool. It also tastes really great and isn't too strong. It's subtle but satisfying.   We liked everything so much that the next day we went to try dine in. Hubby wanted to order egg rolls again, but since we wanted to try a few different things I talked him into holding off on that. We ordered the calamari rings and fish cake (I think it's called Tod Mun). I wanted to get the stuffed chicken wings, but they said they don't sell that anymore. I think not enough people ordered it to keep it on the menu. Those were our appetizers, and of course they were delicious. I also ordered the Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Juice again. For our entree we ordered the Tom Kha Seafood Soup. It came in this cool container with fire heating the soup from the bottom and a hole at the top where the flames would escape a little. The soup was good, but I wouldn't get that one again because it's too pricey for me. It was $20.99 and it had a mix of seafood: couple of crab claws (which didn't have much meat at all), calamari, scallops, clams, and muscles. I think that was it. If I ordered again, I'd probably get the shrimp one for $11.99 instead. We ordered the fried rice again, but it didn't taste as good as that first time. It was not horrible, it just didn't taste as good. I'm not sure if the cook was different or because we took the first one home and ate it later. You never know. Anyways, I think my hubby ordered a papaya salad to go. It probably was delicious like the rest of the food. I don't remember getting to try it. lol. I did order another Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Juice to go since it's so good. Sadly, Dutch wasn't there this time, but the service was pretty good. You can always call someone to help you if you need it and they're pretty friendly. The restaurant isn't too big, and the times we went it was super busy. I think it's cool that they have a lot of veggie options for those that are vegans. I think the best deal is the lunch special for $6.99 and the Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Juice is awesome so you gotta try it at least once!",

I ordered orange chicken and combination fried rice, along with summer rolls.  I was kinda shocked at the lack of protein in these dishes.    The summer roll had 2 shrimp per roll, instead of the 4-6 per roll of most places. The peanut sauce was delicious but I felt i was just eating a salad in a cool vessel.   The mounding order of fried rice contained a grand total of 3 shrimp, and maybe 3-4 oz of chicken in a full size serving.  No soy sauce was offered, and to be honest it was the farthest thing from \"fried\" rice I've had in quite some time.   The orange chicken consisted mainly of (overly) deep fried breading.  To the point where I couldn't even tell if there was actual chicken in it the pieces were so small.  I can see this place appealing to vegans, but as a carnivore I'll forget this place even exists. I know of much more generous and just as tasty Thai places that'll just require me to drive abit further.",

Although it's a significant drive across the valley for me, I made the trek to have lunch with a friend for their vegan specialities. The entire menu is expansive, but the lunch menu is a good sampling of what they offer. The pricing, portion, and speed of service allow you to pop in here for a quick working lunch on a weekday, too.  I had to start with the fried spinach appetizer- a similar dish is served at another great spot in town, but priced nearly twice as high. I found Thailicious' version to be comparable in both portion size and quality. That dressing they use is great! The vegan pad thai, available with either fried or sauteed tofu, was a large portion packed with noodles and veggies. The starter soup and spring roll were well-made and flavorful, too. I sampled my friend's beef pad thai and the meat was tender and well-prepared. I'm looking forward to my next work trip across town so I can order the vegan khao soi next time!",

Upon arriving, I was a little worried about the vegetarian part of their name and even thought about not going. Now, I have nothing against vegetarians, but I thoroughly enjoy meat. Getting over my initial apprehension, we went inside. The restaurant seemed to be very clean and made adequate spacing between tables. Like many Asian restaurants, they had a lunch menu, which fits me just fine. I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special, which included a choice of the soup or salad. The soup was vegetable, while the salad came with a Thai peanut dressing. I was particularly intrigued by either option, but I decided on the salad. The Pad Thai soon followed, including an egg roll. As with most Thai food, I like it spicy, so I ordered the second hottest option. Surprisingly, it was not nearly as spicy as I expected, but it was still very satisfying.   I have come back several times since they initial time and have found it to be enjoyable each time. If you are looking for some good Thai good and I guess good Vegetarian food? Come check this place out.",

Love the basil/curry flavor or the pineapple. Chicken curry was just delicious and perf! The pad Thai was good as well, but I'm just not a pad thai kinda girl.  I low-key almost got annoyed because me and my friends were going to be late for class. We've asked for our mango with sticky rice since mid-feasting on our meal, just so we knew it was going to come out at a safe time for us. Still, even after we were all done, the mango with sticky rice took so looong. Yes we were late for class, but you guys..... the Mango with sticky rice here was well worth it!!!  Presentation was fantastic. I don't know how or why the sticky rice was bluish/greyish tinged, but the taste was just way above delicious. Mango with sticky rice is one of those Thai dishes that taste the same everywhere, but Thailicious' version will forever stand out to me.   Coming back for sure!!!",

I always try to do take out when I eat there cause it's almost always full around dinner time. They almost always give me the wrong food in my order and they always say \"it'll be ready in 20 minutes\" when really your looking at an hour wait.   If you want a real Chinese/Thai experience with truly special tasting food, I would recommend taking a trip into Asiatown and find a place called King Fu. Doesn't get better than that.",

    "text": "Excellent.  Coming into the restaurant, you're met with a dimly lit atmosphere and friendly servers. Water was refilled at an amazing rate and the servers were very professional. They also have a vegan option, so come thru vegan friends.  Now to the food. We started with the crab wontons. Crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside. A delicious start to the meal. The next thing we ordered was the papaya salad. The vegetables were fresh and imparted a crunchy texture. Combined with the sweetness, acid, and spiciness of the dressing, the papaya salad was very nice. The shrimp on the salad was perfectly cooked. A lot of places tend to overcook their shrimp. The chef in this place does not overcook his shrimp!!! Next was the panang curry. I look for sweetness, creaminess, spice, and overall aroma. With the aroma, the basil, garlic, chili, and coconut aromas are well complimented by the spices. The little dab of coconut milk in the middle was a nice touch. It added more coolness to the dish and it attributed to the overall visual appeal. Next was the pad thai, it was sweet and the noodles had a really nice texture; springy but just soft enough. The last thing we ordered was the mango sticky rice. Pretty sure mangos are out of season, but I'm a sucker for sticky rice. The sweetness blended well with the tanginess of the mango.   Food was like a movie. Eat here guys.",

My dad got the Duck Pad Kra Pao which did not look or taste like duck meat with mostly a lot vegetables again, my mom got the House BBQ chicken which she States was just \"ok\" .

If you don't like things spicy, you can request the spice level to be zero. The Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Drink is my favorite here. It has a hint of lemongrass and comes in blue, but when you squeeze the lemon in and mix it, it turns purple!   I have not dined inside, but have mostly gone in for pick ups for to go orders. With its growing popularity, dinner time can get busy, but you can always call ahead for pick up. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated as well. There is a T.V. on usually playing sports which I like. There is a mixed lot of people from families to couples dining in, so the place is great for a variety of occasions. There is also a section in the menu that is vegan friendly. So there is something for everyone. Will be coming back for sure!",

The wait was horrendous which is to be expected considering the holiday, so we ordered to go.   My favorite item was honestly the fried wontons , lol. They were crunchy and so tasty. I could have eaten an entire order and been happy. The pad Thai was not very good. Noodles were a bit over cooked and the flavor was just okay. The beef broccoli was not great either. Daughter who loves this dish refused to touch it. I can see the appeal considering portions were good and there are many vegan options but we won't be going back.   Gave one start for cleanliness/nice restaurant, one for the wontons and one for the decent service we got when ordering and picking up.",

You chose your level heat (I don't know how high it goes), but for my curry I chose a  level of six on the heat scale, so it was still spicy, but not too overwhelming to where I couldn't eat it.",

The food was pretty good, nothing \"ew\" about the pad se ew. For it being medium spicy, it was a little bit on the spicier side.  Customer service was great. My water was refilled often and I was asked if everything was okay with my order. The employees seemed to genuinely care that customers have a good experience here.  I will probably be back for their lunch special. Not too sure if I'm accurate but I think it's from 11AM to 3PM, with the entrees being $6-$7. So I guess I will pad see ew later, Thailicious!",

However, the staff could use an attitude adjustment. We paid for take out and went on an errand, planning to come back and pick it up. When we arrived, both staff members made sure to tell us how long we were gone.  They claimed we left for an hour, which was impossible, because we ordered our food at 4:10 after and came back by 4:50pm. I know it wasn't within 15 minutes, but since we paid for it already, I'm not sure why they felt the need to insult us a little.   I won't go back there, but it has nothing to do with the food. Staff should be courteous and considerate of all their customers. Ordering takeout and paying for it in advance, means we are coming back. Take it easy on us. We all had a hard day, just as you and would just like to pick up some yummy food, without being treated like that.",

Shared pad se-ew with chicken and green curry with tofu. We loved both and a spice level 5 was solid spicy right where we enjoyed it. To go we took an order of chicken fried rice which they customized since it was for a child, no problem very accommodating. We left knowing this will be our new place to take everyone we know who enjoys good Thai food. The menu is inventive and diverse and I cannot wait to try something new next visit.",

However, the huge chunks of vegetables were not practical for eating in a soup. That being said, I would probably still order this again since the broth was yum!  Vegan fried rice: by the looks of it, it seemed pretty plain, but man was it good. Probably my favorite dish of the night! So much flavor infused into the rice. Definitely recommend! Vegan chowmein: well made. Good ratio of noodles to veggies. Also very flavorful. On a side note, if you ask for spicy, expect it to be spicy! I love that they didn't skimp on the spice for me  Overall, glad we discovered this little place, definitely will be back. Wish they would open a location in Las vegas!",

    "text": "Probably my favorite Thai place in Vegas right now. I went here on a Sunday night dinner with my whole family and we ordered about 8 different dishes, all of which were excellent. The Thai chicken bbq, Thai beef jerky, eggplant, and catfish were probably my favorites. The mango sticky rice was also very good. The place is very clean and the service was exceptional. If there's one criticism I can give, it is that they don't have much choices in their menus compared to other Thai restaurants. Nonetheless, they have the best flavors (quality over quantity!). My family and I are definitely coming back.",

Place was pretty full when we got there but we're seated right away. By the time we left there was a line out the door. One guy in line said that he has been there every week since they opened. My daughter had the Green Curry, I had the Pad Kra Pao and we took an order of Mongolian Beef to go home for the wife. It was all excellent. We will definitely put this on our list of places to revisit with friends and family. My suggestion is go early rather than late or else expect a wait. It's worth it though.",

Then it 100% lived up to that on taste.  They don't have many tables. Like they said in the movie Jaws \" You're gonna need a bigger boat\". This place is going to get swarmed.",

Good sized portions for lunch. Lots of things I want to come back and try for dinner. Wait staff was very attentive and was constantly filling my glass with water, which was very important because their spicy scale runs pretty hot. They have a 1-10 scale. My five had me sweating on the top of my bald head. Felt more like a 7 from most places. My son-in-law's 4 made him wish it was a 3, while my daughter couldn't eat her 3 wishing she ordered a 1.",

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dutch (the owner of Komol's nephew) opened up his own place and I knew that with his experience with his uncle it had to be good. It wasn't just good, it was probably the best Thai food I've ever had. The vegan menu is incredible and the flavors were on point! We ordered several vegan appetizers, a salad and a curry. The butterfly pea lemongrass juice was a new and exciting drink for me and I'm already craving more. Hoping for lots of success with the new spot. A must eat if you're in Las Vegas/Henderson. If I could give them more stars I would.",

Not sure if it was because the rude lady didn't want to talk to me. but what restaurant doesnt answer their phone during lunch time  . I called 3 times they she answered YES?? so im trying to not take it personal but well it felt personal .  I picked up my food it was sitting for who knows how long. not under a heat lamp getting getting cold and soggy. cool! I got the eggplant it was really soggy.  I got the pad thai veggie lunch special there was 1 piece of broccoli, but it tasted pretty good. minus there was no veggies.....eggroll was soggy and cold.  basically the only hott thing we got was my soup Veggie Tom Kah and that wasn't good either was lacking flavor, needed more coconut milk it was very very watered down..no lemongrass flavor, nothing.  maybe we just caught them on an off day, i wanted to love this place but well this first impression sucked .  quest for good vegan food continues.",

Ordered the cashew chicken level one and it still had great flavor, and no heat. Beef pad see ew a level four and it had slight heat. I ordered my yellow curry a level nine. I am used to most Thai restaurants really holding back on the spice and usually order pretty spicy because of it, but this curry is HOT. I feel like for once I finally got a spice level I actually ordered. The restaurant is clean with modern furnishings. The staff is wonderful. The food is great.

After looking over the menu and ordering our beverages, two other customers came in and sat near us. About 5-10 minutes later more customers arrived. Our order still had not been taken. We sat while another server tended to customers who arrived after us. Finally our server came and took our order. Our appetizer came out fairly quick and was delicious. Some time later one out of the two meals we ordered came out. After waiting for an extended period of time, and after noticing everyone that arrived AFTER us was getting their food, we asked to speak to a manager. The response we got was shocking. We were told that food is cooked in two separate parts of kitchen. Wait, What? What does that have to do with my meal not being brought out and everyone else getting THEIR food? Then another employee came out to explain \"sorry, the cook is slow\". Wait, your making excuses for bad service? That's just not acceptable. The cook is slow but everyone else that arrived after us got their food??? That's just BAD SERVICE. It's a shame because the food was good. No effort was made to rectify the problem, just excuses.

It is a small venue but I have seen it on a busy night and they accommodate everyone. I have dined in and taken out and all I can say is good quality food and excellent service. I usually order the yellow curry with chicken(spicy 8/10) or the drunken noodle(spicy 8/10). If you like spicy they definitely come full force. Usually when I go to other Thai restaurants I have to ask for the highest rating of spice because apparently they don't understand my love for spicy food but here it is the perfect amount of heat that is not unbearable. And they are very good on filling up my glass of water which is something I appreciate. And they constantly check up on me to make sure everything is okay even on a busy night. I think one of the best things about this place is that they even offer vegan dishes that taste great. My boyfriend sometimes orders the tofu Mongolian dish and I have tried it, I have to say it was very good. Every time I have order food even for takeout, it has been served extremely fast. I have caught myself being very impressed with how quick our food has come out many times. This is my new favorite restaurant and I am proud to be a satisfied customer!",

We had the Sea Bass with fried basil (I can't recall the name of that one - but it was just perfect), and we ordered the Avocado Green Curry - again, it was amazing. And we had a coconut soup with vegetables. It was perfectly seasoned and really good. We ordered everything vegan (except the fish) and our party shared it all. We also had three vegan desserts - the chocolate cheesecake, fried banana with coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice. All three desserts were stellar. We will be back. FIVE entrees and three desserts + green tea for everyone came to around $80. That's a pretty low price for such good food. I was impressed.",

    "text": "I really loved this restaurant.  Eating here was a happy accident.  I've lived in Henderson for a year and 3 months.  When we first moved we had quite the struggle finding great food.  Thailicious came up in a search with great reviews but it is not close to home so we never ventured out.  My husband and I decided to go to the gym today (I haven't been in more than 6 months) and I was starving after.  I did a Yelp search for the area and Thailicious popped up.    The best thing is that the reviews are accurate.  The restaurant looks clean.  The decor is modern.  They had nice music and the World Series of Poker was playing on the television.  I've been meaning to improve my Poker skills so this was perfect.    I ordered the yellow curry mostly because I wanted potatoes.  The waitress said I could have just had the potatoes in the green one, but I didn't want to be a high maintenance customer.  I order a hot level of six because I wasn't sure what hot actually is for this place.  I like hot, hot food.  I think it's only been twice in my life when someone said a fish would set your mouth on fire and it actually did. Once eating Shrimp Diablo in Cali at some dive joint that set my pants on fire and another time at a Korean Barbecue while eating a random appetizer.  I think they set you on fire there so you'll leave and stop the AYCE.  The number 6 for me was mild.  I'll try an 8 next time for comfortably spicy.    I also had a Thai Iced Tea.  I've never really liked this drink but it's something my husband would normally drink.  It sounded refreshing this day.  I enjoyed it for once.  Most places that he gets his tea from has a bitter brew.  This tasted strong but not old.  I'm not a fan of the bitter stuff.   We order the crab delight (Rangoon) appetizer.  The presentation was pretty.  I swiped the flower and took it home and it now is living in my meditation room.  They prices were small but delicious.    Hubby got the chicken satay to go as he wasn't hungry.  Poor thing missed out.  I like my food hot and fresh.  He said it was, \"Okay.\"  I'm sure if he had been in the mood for Thai and hungry it would have been more than okay.    All righty folks.  That's all I've got.  Wait! I have left overs so I've got this and that.    Ciao! Enjoy Thailicious!",

Been here a lot and am always impressed.  This time had curry, chicken fried rice, Tom yum, vegan Thai beef jerky.    Came back for the 49th time.  Still my favorite in town.  Service, flavor, consistency.  Outstanding!!!!",

Not sure they are staffed appropriately for how busy it was. Orange chicken was basically fried breading. So tight it was barely edible. The chicken, if there was any in most of the pieces was cut way too thin. Second was the shrimp. My wife ordered had that with shrimp, for a $1.50 upcharge. 3 shrimp and they were not extra jumbo sized to justify the cost.",

Their lunch special is $6.99 but for $1.50 more I added shrimp to my pad thai.   I thought the flavor was great and the portion was hearty. I left feeling satisfied and wanting to come back a second time to try more of their offerings. When I opened the menu I was literally struggling to find something to order because everything looked really good.   I am def coming back to this place. The service was fast and friendly. Thank you!",

    "text": "I recently relocated to Henderson from the Southwest part of Vegas so I had to find a new thai spot to scratch my regular curry itch. I got lucky that this place just so happens to be within walking distance of my apartment!  My go to is the Yellow Curry but I have had their Panang Curry, Red Curry, Tom Yum Kai Soup, Drunken Noodles, Duck Red Curry, and Beef Massaman Curry. Everything has always been delicious, inexpensive, and of a perfect portion size.  I do all of my meals as pickup orders and there is always someone available to answer the phone and my orders are ready within 10 minutes.   My only complaint about Thailicious would be that when I order my food a 10/10 on the spice scale, it's not as spicy as other thai spots level 10 is. I would say their 10 is more of a 7, but because the dishes are so flavorful I don't miss the heat so much.",

    "text": "Henderson's choices of Thai restaurants are so few and in between, and most of the few ones aren't that good and not worth going back to.  There are some in betweens (e.g. Penn's Thai and Naga) but just a bit of a drive from Green Valley that I'd sometimes postpone my cravings and wait until I get to central Vegas.    I came across Thailicious serendipitously on a very cold late Sunday night  when my cravings for something hot and spicy kicked in.    I thought about pho but I had pho the day prior to so i opted for Thai soup.    The place was packed.  We didn't have to wait to be seated for long though.  But after we were seated, we had to wait and flagged down one of the wait staff to get our orders.   In fairness, the staff were very cordial and friendly.  The food came and were served (and plated with thai orchid) in a very timely manner.  We ordered 6 dishes in total but only \"cleaned\" 3 serving plates.  -  Seafood Tom Yum was loaded with seafood. It was very good.  There was a perfect balance of the amount of broth and the protein.   It was coconut-creamy, tamarind-sour, palm sugar-sweet, nam pla-salty and thai bird chili-spicy but we scooped and ladled right away so we ended up having and eating/slurping a whop-whop lukewarm soup :(.  That was our fault!.  Yet, we cleaned the pot they served the soup in.   - Beef Jerky was well seasoned and peppery, but not jerky enough.  It came across as just a  deep fried marinated beef strips.  The serving was measly, but the dipping sauce that came with it was very good.   - Phad Pri King  was very standard.  We asked for medium heat but it came heat-free.  It was good but I wished it was dryer and not with a watery red curry sauce.  We had to doggy bag half of the dish.   - Pineapple Fried Rice was interesting.  They added their own touch and they were very generous with cashew nuts and raisins.  Half of the plate,ended up in a doggy bag.    - Beef Panang Curry was my least favorite in our spread.  It seemed as though the meat and the potatoes were pre-cooked and were added on to and tossed with the curry sauce prior to plating.  We didn't finish the dish and doggy bagged it, too.   - Lastly, I ordered Pad See Ewe when the rest wanted Pad Thai.  Pad See Ewe is my standard Thai noodle dish.  This is the dish I always order when trying new Thai restaurants and the one dish that puts a Thai restaurant on my \"will go back and will return\" list.  Pad See Ewe introduced me to Thai cuisine when I had no idea what Thai food was.  Suffice to say, Thailicious' pad see ewe was good.  The sen yai were perfectly cooked, the amalgamation of nam pla and dark soy sauce was to my liking, and the serving portion was shareable.  I just wished they used gai- lan (which is currently cheap and in season and are so readily available in local Asian stores)  instead of the regular steamed brocolli florets.  The guy manning the cashier (maybe the manager, and the owner too) stopped by our table a couple of times and asked us  (a) how was everything (b) if we were locals (c) and told us that they do deliver within 3 miles.  I'd recommend them and I'm definitely coming back (cause I'd like to try their som tum and see if it's as good as mine).",

If you're vegan this is a great place to try out some Thai food too! Make sure to call and check the wait time because they are always slammed. I love the pad Thai and their crab Rangoon appetizer!   The 4 star rating is due to me not being a fan of their egg roll, it tasted a little frozen and not house made. I also feel like they are so busy with customers back to back that they aren't as friendly or welcoming. Other than that, the place is pretty great!",

Everything was so delicious. I'd like to believe that I'm a curry connoisseur and their avocado green curry was the best I've ever had!  It was amazing. Very savory and the flavor was very fragrant, yet not over-powering. The chicken satay was good; the glass noodle salad was yummy too. very refreshing in this Nevada dry heat! I checked in so that I won't forget this place when we come back to Henderson next year.  Prices were very reasonable too!",

    "text": "UPDATE June 7, 2019 Thank you THAILICIOUS  for starting off my birthday weekend RIGHT!! We just had a GREAT experience here tonight.  The food was so tasty and fresh! Everything perfectly cooked!  I had a bowl of the Tom Kha Veggie soup and it could be the best I've ever had. Honestly! I started a vegan Detox program/diet last week and I am psyched to know I can come here and find something healthy, yet so very delicious to eat without straying from the plan.  Their fresh tofu rolls are a refreshing starter.  Though I didn't eat any of my daughters veggie chow mein noodles, I did pick at the lightly sauteed , al dente vegetables on top.  Husband ALMOST ordered one of their interesting looking fish dishes, but ended up going for his usual ORANGE CHICKEN which he said was really good. We finished with a delightful mango sticky rice desert that they kindly topped with a bday candle and a dollop of whipped cream. Everything was super flavorful! All of this matched with this gorgeously green  drink they call THAI ICED GREEN TEA that had the most unique floral flavor I really enjoyed. WE WILL BE BACK:Sooner than later   OLD REVIEW BELOW:  Ugh I'm so sorry I have to give this establishment a 3 today, especially since my first review many months ago was a 5. Why only a 3? Burnt Shrimp Pad Thai! If we had been dining in the actual restaurant, then maybe we could've asked for a remake, but since it was a take out meal, the  whole entree went straight into the trash can because we honestly couldn't stomach it, even the eggs had a dark slightly burnt black color to them. That burnt flavor overpowered the entire dish. It was The worst pad Thai I've  ever tried, which is so disappointing because we've enjoyed their pad Thai in the past and found it to be phenomenal. I'm hoping this was just a strange glitch that won't happen again. We'll certainly be back  because  the PANANG vegetable curry was tasty.  My husband enjoyed the orange chicken. The Thai iced was yummy, too.",

We've never tasted more bland thai food in our lives, NEVER! Thai food is known for its fresh ingredients and robust flavors. I've been to a ton of thai restaurants and never have I been disappointed; this was a first. I'm visiting from California and this is the first thai restaurant I've been to, in Nevada. I don't know if it's a Nevada thing?? I ordered the Kra Pao fried rice with chicken, Kra Pao veggie fried rice, chicken wontons and veggie steam dumplings and two orders of sticky rice and mango. The chicken fried rice was absolutely bland. It tasted like all the ingredients were mixed together with no seasoning and grilled over fire. I ordered it mild and there was no spice whatsoever. The wontons were flat with very little meat. I felt like I was chewing mostly, pastry. Luckily I had sweet chili sauce to dip them in. I've never been to a thai restaurant that made the wontons flat???  My daughter had the veggie fried rice, dumplings and sticky rice and mango. Her veggie fried rice was just as bland as my rice. She ordered hers at spice level 6 and she tasted absolutely no spice, whatsoever. My daughter said the veggie dumplings were good; we have a winner. The mango and sticky rice was the only thing I enjoyed. We were so disappointed. I am still in disbelief of the taste of the food. It's so bad that we think they forgot ingredients while preparing both our dishes. I am not exaggerating, the rice didn't taste gross it tasted like, well nothing. I almost want to take the food back and ask them if they forgot ingredients while preparing it. It's baffling! Thai food with NO flavor???? We spent $50.00 on our meal. ",

    "text": "Shout out to the owner Gray Murillo for his Grand Opening!    I'm so glad that he opened up this restaurant!   The place was invitingly romantic and spacious. The service was on point and they were attentive to their customers. Our waters were refilled at reasonable times. They offered vegan suggestions and dishes if you're unsure of what to order. Dutch made sure that we had a pleasant experience.   We started off with an appetizer, crab wonton, papaya salad. And for the main dishes Pad Thai and Panang Curry.   Everything that we ordered were aesthetically pleasing.   The crab wontons were crispy with a lot cream cheese and a lot of love. With the papaya salad, the proportion was a lot bigger than expected. You're getting the worth for your money. Totally worth it. The shrimps that came with it were cooked just right. They made that simple dish 10x better.    A Thai restaurant isn't a Thai restaurant without Pad Thai and some Panang Curry! The texture of the noodles were perfect and it was really saucey. It wasn't dry like other Thai places.   For me, what brought everything together was the creaminess of the Panang curry. It had a dash of coconut milk right in the middle. And the crispness of the tofu and bell peppers went so well with the curry.   For dessert, we had mango sticky rice. The warmness of the rice paired well with the mango.   I highly recommend that you try this place. We are definitely coming back to try their other dishes.",

The next time I got the vegan avocado and green curry. This was also really good! I do feel like they added avocado to the green curry, but I haven't tried their green curry by itself so I'm not sure. But I would honestly keep coming back to this place! The spring rolls were really good and my son loved them! I love how they have a separate vegan menu like that really warms my heart. I wish more places did that. So please go to this place!

Now I am little bummed because I didn't get to snap any pics, I arrived late and everyone was already eating and engaging in conversation, but I will definitely on my next visit. The pad Thai noodles were delicious, it was very flavorful and had a nice taste and texture, now I know that's a popular dish, but I have been to few Thai places that try to add extra ingredients or spices, now this place keep it authentic and it was good!  The other dish, I had had thicker rice noodles and I can't remember the proper name but it was delicious. I can't wait to try more dishes here in my next visit",

The dish didn't come with rice, but luckily I had some steam-in-bag jasmine rice from Trader Joe's in the freezer. I was really looking forward to the mushrooms I saw in the other photos of Tom Kha. In fact, that's why I chose the veggie option, because I thought for sure it would have mushrooms. There were exactly zero mushrooms in my soup however. Nonetheless, it was still good. It was loaded with cabbage, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots and just the right amount of spice. Overall I was pleased with my dishes and already have a list of items I want to order next time. I may order takeout again next time though because when I walked in to collect my food the restaurant lighting was on full force. Felt a little like when they turn the lights on after an evening at the bar and it's leaving time. I prefer a bit dimmer lighting at dinner time! Not a deal breaker though.",

Not only is the food amazing, the staff is really nice and the place is clean and modern. It does get really busy, every day of the week, so be prepared to wait a little bit sometimes. I've got take out from here before and it's just as good and they package it really well so that's always an option. My only complaint, is when you order a soft drink, they bring out a glass with ice and a can of whatever. Certainly, not a deal breaker!",

I thought it was going to be like all the other asian places in town but was so pleasantly surprised with everything I needed to write a review. Pick-up was fast and easy which is super important to me. So nice they had two registers because a lot of people were picking up things. They said 20 minutes to pick up when I placed order. I got there about 15 min after placing my order, so I was a little early, but I paid and my food was ready right when I was done. Points for being on time. :) Everything was so fast and efficient. Most of all after I got home all our food was delish and fresh. My husband loved the chicken satay and my beef and broccoli was probably the best I've ever had. Super great flavor, perfectly cooked broccoli, good quality pieces of beef (not all gristly or weird like they can be sometimes) and the sauce wasn't all thick or sugary. My Tom Yum Veggie had tons of veggies and spicing was right on. Glad we found this place and looking forward to trying their other items soon!",

Unfortunately I have to this time for reasons I'll explain shortly. The service was pretty good, the girl who helped us was super sweet and accommodating. The place itself is very beautiful on the inside and very comfy. The food is very authentic with the exception of one thing: spice level. Maybe I've been spoiled by all the delicious Thai and south East Asian restaurants in California, but i expect a 6 level spice to be a 6 and not a 1. I'll give them some credit for not assuming I can't handle spice and not asking me what level I want and just giving me whatever. She asked me what level for papaya salad, and I said 6 worrying that it would be too hot since Thai usually runs hot. I had to ask for a spice cart and dumped everything into the papaya salad. My mom had curry spice level 8, and it was more like a 2. Disappointing to say the least, just didn't seem right to me. Papaya salad has always been known to be spicy and this just didn't cut it. At least they used actual Thai spice rather than cayenne pepper like some other Thai places here.  This place is much better flavor wise than most hendertucky Thai places, but still doesn't cut it for spice level for me. I might give this place a second chance in the future, but I am going to ask for a 10 and if it comes level 1 I'm just going to be doubly disappointed.",

Some beautiful classic Thai artwork accompanied by a modern dining area. Upon arrival we were cheerfully greeted and seated promptly. I ordered a Thai tea and it was to die for! One of the best I've ever had and it's completely vegan!   We ordered a variety of dishes my favorites were their Beef Jerky appetizer(), Beef Pad Se Ew and Orange chicken. The Orange chicken is like no other it's got a wonderful crisp and a fantastic sweet orange sauce that tastes great with the rice.  In addition to those we ordered crispy spring rolls, seafood pad kee mao, krac pow chicken, drunken noodle, pork skewers and lard na. Everyone loved it all dishes had great authentic Thai flavors.   For desert we shared my favorite, mango with sweet sticky rice which was no disappointment and a perfect finish to a very fulfilling dinner. I cant wait to head back to Vegas to get my Thai food fix!",

    "text": "Hello folks!! Was looking for another vegan place to eat. Of course I used Yelp to find this type of restaurant. And I saw Thailicious. I decided to pick something up from them after my appointment. I walk in and it's a very nice and clean place. The people were very friendly. So so far so good and this place has quite a few good reviews. I ordered off of their vegan portion of the menu. For my vegan folks lots of choices mainly all of them have tofu. I'm sure you can request the tofu to be withheld as I don't like tofu either. But you do have quite a few choices. I chose the Vegan egg rolls and the vegan pineapple fried rice. It took about 12 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I received my food. So that wasn't that bad. paid for my food and it cost $16.22. Looking at the food it was very tasty looking. I first started with the egg rolls because those are my favorite. They were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They were just whatever to me.. they weren't bad and they weren't great. They were just regular egg rolls. I also ordered their pineapple fried rice. Again it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Maybe I'm a bit stereotypical when it comes to Thai food. I expect big bold flavors and spice to clear your nasal passage. This wasn't spicy at all and  was just okay tasting. I feel a bit let down and Desiring Thai food because this place just didn't hit the spot. maybe they have different chefs at different times. I don't know.... my apologies Thailicious! I don't like to give low ratings. It's like being excited because of the previews for a movie and you go watch it and the only good parts were in the previews. If I could give any advice and not that you will take it as I'm no chef. I would say to pick bold flavors and spice it up. Good luck Thailicious!",

Well, pretty much every time I go here I try something new because everything is SO GOOD. I've never been let down.  The Pad Thai might be the best I've ever had, yellow curry is to die for, I even tried the avocado green curry and it is amazing. The orange tofu and curry fried rice are delicious too.  My husband and I love to start our meal with the vegan beef jerky, fried spring rolls or corn cakes. We always leave feeling so satisfied, and we don't feel like crap afterwards. No sick feeling from crappy low quality ingredients. I feel great after we eat. The staff is always real nice too. Honestly it's becoming my favorite restaurant in town",

There were many four tops open and they sat us at a two top.  I asked if we could sit at larger table and they said no.  The next party of one they sat down at a four top and this happened two more times. The chicken satay was tough and chewy, the dumplings had a piece of hair in it, and the sweet and sour was tasteless.  No one asked us about our meal when almost all of it was left uneaten. There are many places to eat Thai food so we will move on.",

Restaurant was packed and told 30 minute wait. Was only 10. Staff turned over tables quickly.   Nice menu. Good Vegan and non vegan choices.   Had the beef jerky. Excellent. Penang Chicken. Best dish. Just slightly sweet and seasoned at 5/10. Not too hot, but nice kick. Also did eggplant and duck dishes. Both excellent.   Having lived in Thailand, my only comment was the food was very slightly sweet, more than I am used to, but that is my personal preference. (And this is a very minor critique)  Great service. Attentive staff. Very clean.   Talked to owners. Mother in kitchen and sons manage. Very good family business. They will continue to do well if they keep attention to detail and keep the service standards high like they are now.",

    "text": "I am so glad we decided to stop in for a Friday night dinner. We were looking from something different from our norm and Thai food is definitely a scarcity for our palates... not anymore! This place is inviting, clean and the staff is very friendly. It's in a quiet shopping center with plenty of parking and from the outside doesn't look very lit, but it's noticeable once you walk up and see all the tables full.   Being new to Thai foods, we generally order the classic pad Thai and my boyfriend is very particular to his fried rice. We figured If they can hook us on that then we definitely can try venturing into curries, different noodle dishes and proteins. They passed the test!   We started with the wings and sticky rice which was a confusing combination to read but when we tried it we completely understood. There's something about that sticky rice, the sweet chili sauce on the side and the crispy outside of the wings.  My boyfriend ordered a Wonton soup and I was so jealous. This isn't your casual Chinese takeout wonton soup... this is a hearty, jam packed with veggies, soft chicken and shrimp in a savory broth with chewy, perfectly seasoned wontons... type of soup. 5/5 for thatin itself!   We couldn't decide on what to order so we decided to try their Shrimp pad Thai, the chicken fried rice and the Mongolian beef. Everything. Was. Delicious. I ordered a \"4\" in spice for my pad Thai and although it was a strong kick for me, I couldn't stop eating it. So much flavor, sort of layered. You get this spice note and then a slightly sweet later and then cool down with the lime squeezed on top, a tangy refresh for the spice.  The fried rice was fresh, you could taste the char on the onions and chicken, the rice was fluffy, seasoned very well and the portion was big.  The Mongolian beef was awesome! Not your expected Mongolian with the flour breading and a sticky, thick sweet sauce... No. This was fresh beef slices with thick cut onion and green peppers, in a sweet savory broth and topped with wonton strips. Something about that broth. So so so good.   Best part was the prices, we did not expect to spend what we did and we were so pleasantly surprised. We just had to take a take out menu to have at home for Thai nights in.   The service was good, a bit slow at first but picked up once some of the tables closed out. They were attentive, helpful and always around when we needed water to take the spices.   I highly recommend Thailicious and definitely plan to be back for a Thai fix soon!",

    "text": "Their red curry and panang curry are TO DIE FOR. Definitely a must try! You absolutely will not regret it :) The addition of coconut milk gives the curries such an incredible richness and wonderfully sweet creaminess. You can choose your level of spice from 1-10 (I personally prefer my spice level to be somewhere between 3-4). Keep in mind that the coconut milk slightly dilutes the spice so I recommend going one level higher from what you'd normally get. All basic curries come with a choice of protein (chicken, pork, or beef. Shrimp costs extra) and a bowl of fluffy rice.   They offer an $8 lunch special menu Tuesday through Friday from 11 AM - 3 PM which includes an egg roll and either the soup of the day or salad along with your meal but to be honest I think ordering off the regular menu gives you a better bang for your buck.  Tips: Great selection of vegan options as well! Plenty of parking at all hours of the day. Located in the same plaza as EoS gym. Closed Mondays.  Overall, highly recommend for their amazing red curry and panang curry!",

The place was nice and small, and luckily when we got there, there wasn't a lot of people. We were seated right away, offered a drink and was handed a menu. The menu had soooo many options.. and my friend was super happy that they had a lot vegetarian options.   I got the pad Thai chicken (spice level 7) and Tom yum soup (spice level 5). NOTE to self next time; lower the spice level!!! The pad Thai was super spicy for me, and usually I do well with a lot of spice.   Overall, service was great, food was delicious and I think the location is even dangerously awesome, since it's about a two minute walk from the gym!",

    "text": "This new Thai restaurant has honestly let me down and I'm DISAPPOINTED with the CONSISTENCY of their food. The other day I ordered a Pad Thai with tofu and a Drunken Noodle with chicken for take-out. Both meals were made very poorly and tasted SOOO PLAIN! My drunken noodle looked like a bunch of flat rice noodles mixed in soy sauce. I asked for it to be level 7 spicy, but they probably forgot to add the spice in.   We couldn't go back to correct the problem and this isn't the first time they served me UNDERWHELMING food. For some reason, every time I ask for extra noodles they don't include enough seasoning to make it taste like real Thai food. Moving onto the Pad Thai, it's just as bad. Thailicious DOES NOT add enough flavor to make it authentic Thai food. It's very mild and you CANNOT taste the tamarind flavor. That is a very important component to enjoying Pad Thai.   The ONLY thing good enough to eat here is the CRISPY EGGPLANT appetizer. It comes with plum sauce and the eggplant is battered with tempera and deep fried to perfection. I can't imagine going back here any longer. I would rather go to VALLEY THAI any day of the week for authentic Thai food that has not disappointed me!",

    "text": "Amazing Thai food that has both vegan and meat dishes! Came with my grandma on a Friday night and the place was filling up. We got a table and the service was friendly and amazing. I had the Thai iced coffee. Grandma had the hot tea, which is a jasmine green tea that she loved.   For a starter, we had the veggie fresh rolls with tofu. They were huge and delicious. I don't know what they put in their peanut sauce, but I wanted to eat a bowl of it alone. The roll was beautiful and had carrot, noodles, bean sprouts, lettuce, tofu, and herbs. It actually looked just like the photo in the menu book!  For dinner, I had the pad kra pao with chicken, which comes with a side of white rice. They do spice on a scale of 1-10. I picked a 4 and it was pretty spicy! Thailicious does NOT play around. I would say it was hotter than a serrano chili, but not painfully hot. It had such a depth of flavor that I kept eating. Thank God for the Thai iced coffee and the water they bring at the start of your meal! If you don't like spicy food, stick with a 1 or a 0.   I tried my grandma's cashew chicken and it was so delicious! There was a ton of chicken, plus carrots, onions, bell peppers, and cashews. The sauce was amazing and I wanted to keep eating it.   The meals are huge and could easily be two servings each. Definitely enough to share! Plus, dinner for two with an appetizer came to a whole $32 and we each had enough leftovers for another meal. This place is a steal! I'm definitely bringing my vegan friends when they come to visit. I love that they have a carefully thought out and extensive menu for vegans, rather than just one or two token dishes that seem like an afterthought!",

Their multiple vegan offerings are tasty, the service is always pleasant and professional, and their food it always delicious and well-presented. The only con here in my option is the small dining room. I wish it were a bit larger to accommodate more guests because it does get busy and the waiting area is not separate from the dining area - which makes it difficult to not watch the diners eat their meals.  Other than the small dining room, Thailicious consistently has earned a 5-star rating from me across the 5 or 6 times that I've dined here.",

There is a dedicated vegan menu which means they're not \"we can make anything vegan, just ask\".   What I liked: Crispy Eggplant - not over cooked and the sweet chili sauce they use, fantastic! Makes you craving more but then again what fried and sweet doesn't?  Mongolian Tofu - again, excellent sauce. We had it medium spicy and yowza! The onions were cooked well but crisp enough for freshness. Tofu not overfried  Panang Tofu - the serving size and both dishes were excellent. Lots of veggies with this dish and the sauce was not watery  Tea: Tea used here is Stassen Jasmine Green Tea and it's well caffeinated but not too potent  Portion Sizes and Pricing - get a to go box. Very generous portion sizes for the prices  What I didn't care for: Veggie Crispy Spring Rolls - these have the taste that reminds me of frozen spring rolls where you got a good crispy outside but mushy inside  That Day and The Day After - Both me and my partner had stomach issues. I couldn't sleep. Tossed the delicious food. Something was right...we can handle spice too. Not sure. Read other reviews just in case...  Neutral: Service- now they get packed from being so good so while the beginning was a bit slow we were checked on about 3x. That's pretty good for being busy. We didn't the goodbye when leaving but again, busy restaurant and great food  Overall: 3 stars for taste, ambience and quantity! I knocked off 2 stars for the stomach issues and crummy spring rolls.  I don't see us coming back again...maybe we will but ugh. My stomach!",

She gave me some what of an attitude and had to go ask the boss. Then after I ordered it, the dish came out without meat which is not what I wanted.

    "text": "By far the best Thai restaurant I've been to. I've been to many Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, but this one has to be my favorite. To start off, the atmosphere and aura of the place was amazing. Very modern, hip, clean, and aesthetically pleasing --- but what tied it all together, despite how modern it is, were the authentic decorations that represented Thailand as a whole. Next, is the customer service. They were quick to greet me with a smile. Although there have been times where it was extremely busy, they always manage to offer me water, or reassure me that my table/waiting time will soon come to a shorten length. You can definitely tell that the owners are very involved in the restaurant because they have been there every time I have came. They don't  just make small talk with their customers, they make them feel like family. Lastly, comes the food. They amazed me with their dishes and appetizers. As you can tell from the pictures, it was definitely hard to just pick one appetizer. I tried the beef green curry on this night as well. The curries are beyond amazing and the beef pad se ew is also a favorite of mine. Their beef is very marinated and tender! My guests loved it here, as it was there first time. Their food has actually had me question if I should go vegan  their vegan options are amazing, I might just have to convert! From the setting, to the service, to the food --- Thailicious has become my #1 Thai food restaurant! I highly recommend trying it. Driving across town for it is most definitely worth it!",

Sounded like a great place so my husband and I went to check it out around 5:30 pm a few days ago. Unfortunately, we did not have the best experience. The restaurant was freezing (no heat). Everyone was eating wearing their jackets. There was a really loud group who sat and sat talking loudly and rude most of the time we were there.  The food was OK but since it was barely warm it was hard to decide. I mentioned it to our waiter who said he would heat them up in the microwave. No thanks.  We sent the tea back because it was tepid if you could even call it that. They finally brought out a pot of \"hot\" water with a tea bag (no loose tea). Hey, I carry tea bags in my purse. White rice was to come with both our entrees but we only got one order which was barely warm and then when we were packing our to go cartons, because who wants to eat cold food, they brought the other order which was hot, but we were leaving. Not the best recommendation. They need to up their game. I did see a lot of pick up orders so maybe that is their specialty. (You can then heat up the food at home).",

The plate from the soup was chipped and the broth of the soup was bland. The Pad kra paid (with chicken) was flavorful and balanced with heat-spice, but the chicken was dry.

I went on a Monday night for the first time and quickly returned the following Wednesday. It's Friday and I'm already set to meet a friend there early this upcoming week. IT WAS THAT GOOD YOU GUYS.   I would 100 percent recommend getting the tom kha (the one with coconut milk) soup under the vegan options. I was blown away at the flavor of this soup. It's the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and spicy. The veggies in this soup are hearty, and flavorful. Let's not forget about the incredible aroma of this soup. It's heaven.  After my first trying their soup, I could not stop thinking about it. My four year old even asked for it days later. (That says a lot!)   I returned for lunch two days later (they offer great lunch specials) to get a large order of the coconut milk soup and a lunch portion of yellow curry with shrimp. AGAIN- everything was phenomenal. I didn't want it to end. I would totally recommend the salad as a side because  their ginger dressing is tangy gingery perfection. It was seriously so tasty.  The restaurant is super clean. The service is excellent, the presentation is beautiful, and the staff is as friendly as they come. I love that they offer so many vegan options.   I am going to make it a point to eat here weekly. Honest to goodness my new favorite spot to eat!",

The wings were sweet and salty and the meat had a nice chew to it. - Pad See Ew Beef - not as pan fried as I would have liked, but still good. - Panang Pork Curry - the curry is not as thick as I would have liked either, but the flavor profile was there.  We wanted to order the crispy duck panang but they ran out.  We also ordered the thai iced tea and thai iced coffee, but they had to brew a new batch so we only got it half way through our meals...so that became dessert instead.  Overall, the food was better than I expected, and staff was great.  We will definitely come back to hopefully try the crispy duck panang and crabmeat fried rice.",

The menu is equally expansive for vegans as it is for omnivores, and almost everything seems to have a vegan equivalent. Even better is that the Thai iced tea comes vegan so there's no confusion about the creamer in it or concern that they might forget to sub it out. I crave Thai iced tea on a pretty regular basis, so having one that reminds me perfectly of my pre-vegan days (without compromising on my diet) is super exciting! I had their red curry, which was quite yummy, and my partner-- who isn't even vegan-- gave the khao soi a try (as the vegan version, since they had both), and he said it was really good too! The crispy rolls were pretty good, and the value is definitely worth it. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other dishes-- if anyone can pry me away from the curry.",

Is that the location it is in is a difficult shopping center to get to, and there is no real advertisement or signage going on for this place...that is all that is bad I can say about this spot!  Started going to this place recently, maybe the past month and I am happy I checked it out. I have been getting the pad thai with chicken #5 on the spice and a thai tea and I must say already several visits in i am ready to try another dish. Not because I am sick of the same dish (today for example my pad thai chicken was so good i cleared the plate) but because the other dishes I saw people enjoying looked excellent.  The food taste very fresh. I have only been going for lunch, price is $8 and you can't beat it with the portion they offer. Presentation is perfect also, served on a square plate, clean and neat. Perfect portions (today had a little bit extra I think but I am not complaining).  Must go to check out if you like Thai food and want something delicious. Don't waste your time going over to Teriyaki Madness (although that's isnt bad either) you know, why settle for eh when you can have whoa?",

The portion was great, it came with rice and a huge bowl of the khao soi. However it lacked the authentic flavor I was hoping for. On a different day I got the vegan pad thai which was also disappointing - it was almost flavorless.   Heads-up: Call ahead before getting here because there was a 15-20 minute wait when we arrived.

The inside was very slow with only three patrons seated when we arrived.  Thailicious has a great location (215 & Stephanie) located in a strip shopping area.  Unfortunately,  I found the service subpar, especially considering business was slow and three servers were \"working the dining area\".  We started with PLA GOONG (shrimp salad) which had very little lettuce and was served with a warm dressing, not my favorite.  My dinner  arrived 10 minutes after my daughters, no explanation or communication from our server!  The Pad Thai in my opinion doesn't have an authentic texture or flavor - leaving me with no reason to return or reheat my leftovers.",

It's a modern atmosphere, and the staff works together for timely and efficient service. It's casual and comfortable! As far as the food, I've eaten here at least 10 times and I've never been disappointed. It's healthy, fresh and has many vegan options. I always get the paradise salad. Crisp tofu, shaved green apple, shredded carrots and a bit of crunch from the cashews! It has a hint of coconut and I had them to a 7 for spiciness. We tried the duck soup and the pad Thai with chicken. Both were fantastic! The duck soup had a rich broth, but not too heavy where it over powered the duck. The pad Thai was as to be expected from any Thai restaurant. The restaurant is always clean. If you're in the mood for healthy, tasty food. This is a hit! My husband and I ordered these three dishes, and brought plenty home for a solid lunch for the next day.",

The duck was so juicy and so good! It's a good portion for how much it was. Their pad Thai is also another favorite. Other places we've tried made their pad Thai really sweet but their pad Thai is more on the sour and spicy side. Their coconut soup is also pretty good. Love to eat Thai soup with rice  My husband loves their larb and he gets them with extra lettuce cup.   Definitely give them a try when you have a chance. They also have lunch specials during the weekday.",

The food here is absolutely delicious! As a matter of fact, it's amongst the tastiest I've had in the Las Vegas Valley! The last time I ate here (yesterday), I ate every ounce of food on my plate and wanted more! Well okay, maybe that's because I cycled for two and a half hours up and down hills through the desert at a vigorous speed! Lol! But truly, it is delicious!!!   Okay, so let's talk about the atmosphere. It feels crowded. I don't want to be disrespectful, but the dining area is a big square room with tables and chairs. No booths. No privacy. No decor. And the chairs and benches are quite uncomfortable. The plaza is unoccupied, with many vacant storefronts. There's not a lot going on for some reason. It almost feels industrial.   On a positive note, the servers certainly make up for the lack of decor in the restaurant and the lack of activity in the plaza. The people here are sooo nice, and the service is excellent!   My final thoughts... take out would be ideal, since I live so close! I don't think they deliver, but I don't mind ordering delivery via Yelp!",

I absolutely love that they have several pages on their menu dedicated to strictly vegan food/drink options - bravo Thailicious!  Dishes I've Tried (all vegan, all 5/5!) + Red curry w/ brown rice  + Avocado green curry w/ brown rice  + Tofu pad Thai + Vegetable pad Thai  + Vegetable spring rolls   Pros + Yum + YUMM + YUMMY! + Cute Small intimate local place  + Friendly, fast service  + Affordable lunch specials M-F, 11am-3pm + Tastiest Thai food I've ever had  Cons - it's a cute small place, so during the week around dinner time it gets a little busy; therefore, there might be a wait. - Food is habit forming, sooo long skinny jeans (haha jk a lot of it is healthy!)  I challenge non-vegans to order a dish off of the vegan menu. You will be shocked and how flavorful it is. If you accept my challenge shoot me a message on here and let me know your thoughts!",

    "text": "It's not Thai-riffic, but I liked it.  Thailicious Authentic Thai & Vegan (note: I didn't do anything vegan here and don't plan to in the foreseeable future) is a very popular spot that has been serving Henderson for over a year. Located on the other side of the plaza from the EoS Fitness on Stephanie and constantly drawing my eye when I would see it from the highway, this restaurant finally enticed me to come in for dinner on a cold night after flying back in to town.  We actually had to wait a good 10-15 minutes to get seated (tip: sign the waiting list at the front desk), and once we did, it surprisingly took quite a while until we could order. Kinda funny considering that they checked on us about 4 times in quick succession after we got our food.  Overall, portions were great and everything was enjoyable, so I wouldn't give it just 3 stars. I could see myself taking a quick jaunt down the highway for a lunch special or stopping by to grab dinner. But I'm gonna nitpick to explain why this isn't anywhere near a 5-star review.  Khao Soi ($11.99): a curry noodle soup that gets even better when eaten with the sides of mustard greens, red onion, and lime (for squeezing). I'm glad that I ran into an old acquaintance (sup, Ivo) who recommended this to me.  Now the nitpicks: I was confused that the noodles were round instead of the flat noodles in other versions which I've enjoyed. I also could tell that the broth was basically the \"coconut milk with curry powder\" which the menu described, nothing more. Other khao soi broths are clearly more layered and flavorful.  Massaman Beef Curry ($9.99): a beef-only option. It's sweeter than other curries, and the peanuts are a fun difference. However, the potatoes were undercooked for my taste, perhaps because they were cut into such large chunks.  Red Curry with Chicken ($9.99): about as savory and flavorful as you'd typically expect from red curry, but I was surprised that I didn't get much heat when ordering a spicy level 3 out of 10. At one of my favorite Thai places, I'm accustomed to a low level of suffering from a red curry with a 3 out of 10.  Sticky Rice ($2.00): too dense and consequently too tough to cut. The blue color is just a dye gimmick. Not my personal choice for an order, and not planning to get this again ever.  I'll definitely try some of the more typical noodle dishes and consider some of the soups and apps. Thailicious is at least Thai-lerable, but it's far from Thai-mazing.",

Right when they opened at noon, a whole swarm of us came into the joint. I saw so many locals and regulars come in and immediately felt like this was a cool neighborhood small business. We decided to order a few things to share and then other items when we came back again.   Food: We started with the crispy spinach, vegan crispy rolls, and steamed dumplings. My little one crushed everything aka ate it all up without even blinking. The spinach was the fun welcome surprise we hadn't tried before. I ordered the tofu pad see ew (thick noodles with brown sauce and broccoli) and my husband did the tofu pad Thai while my little one had veggie fried rice (extra peas of course.) ... we barely had leftovers to bring home!   Service: Our water glass never went empty and everyone who worked there checked in on us regularly. We even chummed it up with others near our table as we all watched some Sunday afternoon football.   I'm pumped we now have another vegan-friendly restaurant to support!   Next on the list to try: papaya salad and fresh rolls!",

I wish they had a smaller scale because 1-10 is too large of a scale to decide with. Or a normal mild-medium-hot scale would be even easier. When I asked the worker over the phone how spicy are their levels, she replied \"I don't know the answer to that.\"   Would we come again? Probably not because it wasn't super impressive.",

This is a pretty great deal especially when I'm used to CA prices. Their vegan menu is pretty extensive which I appreciate. But at the same time, most Thai food can be made vegan even if it's not explicitly stated.  My order was the green curry. It came with a cup of soup (or salad) and egg roll. The soup was a nice and simple veggie soup that I enjoyed. The egg roll was kind of bland and I didn't care for it much. The curry was decent. I really liked the fried tofu in it. But I feel it lacked in variety of veggies. And most importantly it lacked in SPICE. I got a level 9 and I didn't feel a thing. It seemed a bit watered down than your usual creamy and flavorful Thai curries. Plus the portion is pretty small (but that's expected with the cheap lunch price).   I would've given this place a 4, but the servers were RUDE. They took forever to seat me, even though I was alone and there were many tables open. They didn't really try to be hospitable/friendly during my meal either. When I was clearly done with my food, I waited over 15 min for a check.. Even though they sat me literally right in front of where they were standing the whole time. So eventually I just had to call them over.  Maybe they didn't care to give me good service since I'm just a solo person coming in for lunch, so I wouldn't be spending much. But you would think they'd try harder to get a repeat customer. Nope, not me, sorry.",

I started to yelp for Thai food and found the next nearest location which was Thailicious just further down the street of S. Stephanie st.   First walked in, it was a very quaint and modest. Against the wall would be a mural of a  Thai temple I am assuming. Light fixtures were cute and added texture to the overall layout of the restaurant.  I told the girl at the hostess desk that it was my first time and I wanted to to take out.   As I sat down waiting for my food to come out, Dutch, the owner and ask me if I wanted anything to drink hot  or cold. The I asked for Hot Tea and he came out with a glass mug and served me jasmine Green tea. I thought,\" O Wow!\" Very thoughtful. He represented his restaurant very well which tells me he cares about his business.  When 7:00 pm came around it was getting packed. And I notice he has regulars that came back because he would say welcome back.   I ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, spicy level 4. Kra Pao Fried rice, spicy level 3 ad Vegan Papaya salad, spicy level 2. When I got home and Everything that I had was amazing. It hit the spot for me. I would definitely come back here again and dine in. Great Hidden Gem!",

They ask you on a scale from 1-10 how spicy you want your food. We got a 4. If you're a whimp when it comes to spicy food (like me!!!) you might want to go a little lower because they like their spice! We ordered the papaya salad, pad thai, and red curry and all were delicious & the portions are huge! We will definitely be back! Inside the restaurant, seating is a little bit limited but it's clean and tastefully decorated. I definitely recommend!",

The menu has a great selection without being overwhelming. The prices are reasonable and portions just right. The vegetarian and vegan options are amazing. It's great to have a Thai place that offers more than just tofu options to its regular menu.  The soups are my favorite--full of veggies. The veggie spring rolls are delicious. The meat options are tasty too. You can add heat to any dish in reasonable increments.",

    "text": "So with all the incredible reviews, I had to go try this restaurant. Unfortunately, Thailicious was only Thaiokayish for me today. First, walking into the restaurant, the setting seemed very wrong to me, A table right by the front door and the front desk set back from it, so everyone entering is literally passing right next to your table, never mind passing it, they wait right next to you to be seated. Okay, perhaps trivial. Tables are set so close to one another you cant have a private conversion with your date. We were brought water right away, good start, orders taken promptly thereafter. Wife ordered Pad Thai with tofu, I ordered eggplant with chicken. But I also ordered the crispy spinach appetizer. So my wife's plate shows up around 10 minutes later and she is waiting for mine before she starts. I encourage her to enjoy it while its still hot, she noticed it didn't come with crushed peanuts as its suppose to. Another 5 minutes pass by before she could ask for them. My meal finally arrives. So for flavor of food I'll give it 4 stars but service is low 3. So now we have our meals and half way through them, my appetizer shows up. Personally, I should have said take it back. Appetizer is pre meal. The crispy spinach taste good but it was extremely oily. I understand this restaurant is new but prioritizing things shouldn't be so difficult. I'm willing to try it again and see if things get better. Overall, Id say the food is pretty good.",

I will say this tho...the people are friendly and the papaya salad is the best I've ever had.",

    "text": "A great and fantastic addition to the growing Thai food choices in the valley. This one may be one of the best in the Henderson area:  1. Location - In a strip mall right off the 215 and Stephanie in Henderson, it is convenient and easy to find.  2. Ambiance - Really liked the interior design of the place, Simple, but well done, plenty of seating options and a great and friendly staff.  3.  Service - Top notch. You will never run out of ice water here for sure.  And you can tell that they have great teamwork here because they all help each other and when your food is ready, you can be served by any of the team.  I like that as your food comes out hot.  4.  Wait time - We came at a 4:30 on Saturday and there were already several people dining and others waiting for take out.  By about 5:15, the place was getting pretty packed. I am gonna think that this place is pretty darn busy.  5.  The food -  Loved it.  The vegan choices here are fantastic and there are about 4 pages of vegan choices on the menu.  Paradise Salad - With green apples. nice and refreshing.  Eggplant and Basel with ground pork - a fantastic dish, great presentation and taste. As you know, I really enjoy this dish with ground meat, as it picks up the flavor more than sliced meats.  Tom Yum Soup with Chicken - Great tasting with mushrooms and tomatoes. Not the best in the world, but definitely good.  Masaman Curry with Beef -  We always get the yellow curry and sometimes the Masaman curry. The wife tends to like the yellow curry due to thicker and sweet with the coconut milk.  The Masaman is less spicy and has more of that Indian type of flavor  Avocado Green Curry (Vegan) - This was recommend by our waitress, who used to work at Thai Room on Tropicana and Pecos, which is by my office and I see here there.  This was something that was interesting with the avocado, and all the veggies. Overall very nice dish.  The pricing was great, service wonderful, ambiance was perfect.  A great quick meal and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  We will be back for sure!",

The lemon changes the color of the juice from blue to purple and makes it tastes sweeter & fruitier! Then ordered a shrimp pad Thai which wasn't too spicy from a scale from 1-10. I ordered a 2 since I'm sensitive on spice. I ended up adding a little chili sauce to spice it up more. I also tried the Tom Yum was good but needed more lime and spices and after 3 limes, it tasted better. I also tried the Fried Eggplant with sweet & sour sauce, it was amazing! The fried Tofu with brown sugar peanut sauce is also great too!  Jaida was kind enough to even bring a dessert for the birthday celebrant which looked amazing and it was!",

    "text": "Went here because of the reviews and was extremely underwhelmed.  When we arrived there was a wait to get a table which is usually a good sign and we were more than happy to wait the less than 10 minutes to get a table.  Once we sat is when I started to get worried about how the night was going to go.  I watched one of the servers clearing a table by sticking his fingers inside the previous tables glassware and take them to the bus tub which was on a cart in view of the dining room.  He then walked to our table with a pad of paper to take our order without washing his hands.  Not following guidelines set by the health district became a common theme for the rest of the short period we were there.  Another server ringing an order in walked away from the computer towards the kitchen openly coughing and not even attempting to cover his mouth.  The server trying to take our food order never welcomed us, just walked up to the table and said \"ready to order\", I don't understand why formalities are skipped in some restaurants.  So I just ordered a Thai iced tea which I watched him make thru the server entrance of the kitchen and still no washing of hands but he did continuously wipe his hands on his pants.  He also brought lemons which my guest asked for and I said he shouldn't use unless he wanted whatever cold virus the previous table might of had from the glassware that the server stuck his fingers in.  Before the server comes back with our Thai iced tea and lemons another servers walks over and says ready to order and is very annoyed when we ask a few questions.  We asked her opinion and she would shrug her shoulders and say she had no idea, with this we knew we would have to guide our own way thru their large menu.  We ordered crispy eggplant then asked some other questions about other starters and again felt as tho we were taking to long and annoying her.  We ordered the rest quickly, she never asked spicy level but I stated again which we wanted first and then the entrees after the starters.   Within in minutes the server that had yet to wash his hands while continuing to bus tables and deliver food, delivered the crispy eggplant which lacked salt, barely any sauce and there wasn't anything crispy about them.  The staff also called them eggplant chips when dropped off so not sure if there was a different option on the menu that our server sent or not.  Half way thru our \"chips\" the hot pot of Tom kha soup arrived which she set the pot down and the stacked soup cups and spoons down, lit the hot pot and walked off.  She didn't say a thing, there was no \"give this a minute until it's nice and hot\" or \"I'll be back to ladle some out for you\".  I suggested to my guest that we wait a minute for it to start bubbling or at least steam coming from it.  Our server then delivered our entrees and I said that was too fast, we hadn't even finished our \"chips\", she said yeah there was a large party so the kitchen needed to get the food out.  First of all there was only 4 people of this large party that had arrived at this point so they hadn't even ordered and second why does my dining experience have to change due to a partially arrived large party that had yet to order.    At this point we were going to just quickly eat and leave and check it off as a place to never dine at again.  The two dishes we order, red curry and drunken noodles, were ok so it shows me that the food is the saving grace of the dirty handed service staff that is severely lacking.  Our burning hot pot of soup however was warm at best and the vegetables were raw so I flagged the manager over and told him.  He said sorry and said he would take it off our bill, never suggested to send a hot one nor did he ask how everything was.  No one asked how anything was and we even had our plates taken away when they still had some food on it by the server that had yet to wash his hands.  We were over it and just went to the register to pay and when asking for receipt were given the wrong receipt.  On that receipt we noticed how those guests were offered different levels of spice.  On the way back home which is on the other side of town my guest said to me \"what a waste of time that was\" and that's why I am spending my time writing this review.",

I've had the Tom Kha Ka, the Beef Pad Se Ew, the Chicken Yellow Curry, the Thailicious Fried Rice, and the Drunken Seafood Spaghetti.  Of all those items, the only thing I wouldn't order again is the Spaghetti.  The sauce seemed too thick and made the noodles feel sticky.  Other than that, the rest of the food is awesome! My bf loves their fried rice! The place is typically busy and their dining room is pretty small, so you can almost always expect to wait. Other than one girl, who seemed like she really didn't want to be at work, everyone is pretty nice.  At one point, I wanted to try the mango sticky rice (it's one of my favorite thai desserts and I try it at every thai restaurant I go to), and our server was nice enough to let me know that their mangos were on the tart side and he didn't want me to be disappointed.  I really appreciated him giving me the heads up!  I will definitely try it the next time I go in though.",

We love Thai food but have had a hard time finding a place that we want to return too. Thailicious is it! It's a small place with not a lot of tables, but we didn't mind the wait. It was also Friday night. We kept it simple with the traditional Pad Thai and beef Panang. The vegan in our group got the yellow curry and also the Veggie Crisp Rolls. I had the Tom Kha Kung soup, which is my absolute favorite. The youngest enjoyed sweet and sour pork which I was pleasantly pleased with because the batter was light and crispy and not greasy. The sauce was also light and fresh and not too sweet. Next time we will be more adventurous with our ordering. The staff was attentive and very friendly as well. Thanks for opening so close to home!",

    "text": "The food is decent. I like the vegan options.  But, I just had so much higher hopes.  I ordered for pickup the first time. I was very excited to discover vegan desserts when I arrived to pickup my food and promptly ordered the vegan chocolate cheesecake ($5). It was good, a standard vegan chocolate cheesecake that they added fresh fruit on top. I was dismayed to discover a moldy berry, but hoped it was an uncommon error.  The second time, I brought my mom and we ate in the restaurant. I ordered the lunch special pad see-ew with the hot cucumber soup. The soup was amazing. The pad see-ew was not. My mom ordered the lunch special sweet and sour pork with salad. The sweet and sour pork was amazing. The lettuce was standard from a bag. The ginger salad dressing was delicious.   I couldn't wait to order dessert again and gushed to my mom about their vegan desserts. However, the wait staff left me so annoyed that I skipped dessert. Our plates were done and on the side of the table for quite some time. I finally wondered what was up and looked around to see that all 4 waitstaff were talking and looking at their cell phones behind the podium. This went on for several more minutes until our waitress finally put her phone away and noticed I was staring at her.   She lost the usual 20% tip, instead getting about 17% and lost a larger bill because of no dessert.   With the abundance of Thai restaurants nearby, I do not plan on returning. I can also get a whole vegan chocolate cheesecake from Whole Foods and add my own berries (sans mold).",

The best part was how delicious everything tasted!!!! The entrees we ordered (drunken noodles and cashew nut) were not spicy. If you prefer your dish on the spicer side, I would recommend asking the server if the kitchen can increase the spice level. Overall, highly recommend!",

Tables were quickly starting to fill up but we were glad to see that our order was brought out promptly. The restaurant is clean and spacious; their staff attentive, and the food is delicious! We ordered some pad thai, veggie fried rice, and yellow curry--all of which were comforting and flavorful. I did notice that they don't ask for a spice level for any of their dishes. Personally, I do not mind this at all and actually prefer they determine that themselves, but just a heads up for those of you who are used to that at other Thai restaurants. Thailicious also has an extensive plant-based/vegan menu apart from the regular menu, so there was something for everyone. I am definitely bringing my whole family next time!",

The service was nice but very typical of Thai restaurants in the states, serving dishes that are too sweet or too salty. We ordered a number of dishes which included Thailicious Fried Rice, Cold Noodles with Veggies, Coconut Soup with Shrimp, Orange Chicken, & Curry. Skip the Orange Chicken because its very hard and coated with too much batter. The Shrimp was great; large in size, devained and flavorful yet the soup broth was too sweet.  The cold noodles was a nice healthy choice with fresh greens. Fried rice & Curry were the best choices yet I will not order chicken here or beef as its dry and tough to chew. I do get how vegetarians and vegans give this place a 4 to 5 star rating due to its many option choices for non meat eaters. The vegetables are fresh and flavorful and the menu has a couple of pages for vegan options. Overall, this isn't a 4 star restaurant yet we all have different taste when it comes to SE Cuisines.",

You could've got away with three or four big scallops and the sauce and it would've been divine. The sauce/Curry is good and the heat was good as well. My husband got the Kung Pow and it was really small portion. Mostly onion very little bell pepper. Would never order that again.   I would come again to try something else.

They have awesome service (super friendly, always make sure you're okay and your drinks are filled), a great interior (super clean, ikea furniture, awesome floors and walls), and even better food (tasty, authentic, delicious)! The portions are big for what you pay and the food tastes really good.   We've had the pad thai, tom ka, and thailicious fried rice. All of which are super yummy!

They ask you what kinda spice level you want from 1-10 (10 being lost spicy). I got a level 3 and I thought it had a little kick to it . My friend got level 7 and she couldn't eat it! The manager at the restaurant offered to remake it for her but she declined . He ended up taking if off our bill which was super nice since she didn't eat much of it. My husband had a seafood hot and sour soup. He said it was amazing ! He thought it was a little spicy and he likes spice and hot . He ordered a medium .

    "text": "Came here at peak lunch hour on a weekday. It was busy but not completely full - there were some unoccupied tables in the middle but yet there were still people waiting by the door to be seated. There were only two people working the front serving, bussing and seating people which I felt was not enough. They really need some extra help during lunch rush.  On to the food - the tofu skewer appetizer was good, but a little on the pricey side for 5 pieces of tofu. It was perfectly lightly fried, came with some dipping sauce (peanut based I think) and a mini cucumber salad.  Green curry with scallops - your typical curry but had scallops and eggplant in it. I was surprised to see this as an option because I usually don't see it on other Thai menus.  Crab fried rice - delicious. I always want to order this at every Thai restaurant. Very savory, hit the spot for me.  I'd come here again but try to avoid the lunch rush or at least get my food to go. Nice to see a Thai restaurant on this side of town.",

I placed an order to go because we didn't have the time to eat in at the restaurant.  I ordered the house wings and sticky rice for my son, the panang curry for myself, and the green curry for my husband.  Our son absolutely loved the house wings and discovered he loves sticky rice (it was colored blue, which is a nifty way to distinguish sticky rice from steamed rice!)  The sweet and sour sauce that came with the wings was so fresh and tasted so good!  The two curries were exactly what we love!  They were so fresh, authentic, the perfect level of spice (medium) with amazing flavor!!  I am so happy with Thailicious and will definitely be a repeat customer and look forward to trying more dishes!!  I look forward to the next time eating in the restaurant!  It looked really nice when I picked up our food.",

But I enjoyed the customer service even more then the food. Everyone was awesome. There was not one employee who walked by me and didn't ask how I was doing or if my food was ok. It's not easy to find good customer service and authentic food in one location in Las Vegas. I would definitely recommend for Vegan and non vegan foodies.",

Really enjoyed this soup and would absolutely get it again.   Also got the Vegan Yellow Curry and this was so good! Really wish this place was not all the way in Henderson or else I would be going there much more often. Definitely have to go back to this place when I'm in the area.  This place was excellent and I love that they have vegan options + their take out was an expected period of time, about 15 minutes. But this place was not extraordinary. Extraordinary deserves five stars. A review of excellence and a place to get my returning business gets four stars and that is definitely this place.",

Service: From my visits, youre greeted immediately upon entry and seated quickly.  One server was assigned to me but others followed up with me on keeping the drinks fresh and to ensure my dishes were fine.  They have an extensive menu that's smartly divided into Vegan and Non-Vegan and I was asked if I had any questions which I appreciate.  Thai Food:  Here are my current favorites that I'll build on as I visit more.  The Tom Yum Kai Soup was loaded with chicken and mushrooms.  The broth was the perfect amount of sour.  Pad Thai with chicken at a number 6 (out of 10) spicy.  This might have been the tastiest Chicken Pad Thai I've had for 2017.  Noodles were fresh and the spiciness was perfect to the point where it wasn't uncomfortable to chew yet I was sweating.  Well done, and I'm moving to a 7 on the spiciness scale just to see what happens. =)  Ambiance:  This place is currently very popular with limited seating so it might be best to call for reservations during prime times especially with a party of 4+.  Nicely decorated with Thai influnced decorations and Murals on the wall. A flat screen TV is usually showing sporting events or the news.  Dark wooden floors and contemporary bamboo chandeliers makes for a nice dining ambiance.  Excellent quality Thai good that comes out in big portions makes me a big fan of this place.  The value is definitely there and I'm looking forward to trying more dishes in the near future.  Enjoy yourself...=)",

Crispy Spring Rolls Pad Thai Pineapple Fried Rice Thai iced tea  Service is always top notch and everyone there is very helpful.",

We were lucky enough to get one of the last tables. Our food came out a little staggered this time. But they were super busy and likely filled about 15 to go orders in the time we were sitting there. The staff is always attentive as well so we didn't even notice the food took a few minutes longer then usual. We were also lucky enough to try a new desert item... vegan cheesecake! What a an unexpected treat. We all really liked it. This visit we brought our non vegan friend with us. He loved his dishes. He tried the avo green curry vegan style and the thailiscious rice with chicken. But his favorite might have been the vegan orange soy chicken. He will be back and of course I'll be back!",

    "text": "Awesome Thai restaurant conveniently located off of 215 and Stephanie! Have been here a couple of times and forgot to write the review.   1) Parking lot in strip mall so ample parking available always!  2) It's always packed when we come here, so it can take a little bit of time to finally get seated, but it's definitely worth the wait!   3) Ordering food was quick, yet difficult because of their extensive menu of tons of delicious options! Servers were very helpful in recommending options.  4) We've done family style ordering and it's hard to go wrong with any dish! Cucumber salad, crab rangoons, chicken lemongrass coconut soup (all time favorite!!), chicken panang, shrimp pad prik kow, pineapple fried rice, brown rice (which has a cool purple/red tinge) have all been amazing! Different spice levels are offered, but I'd recommend going lower and adding your own spice if you're unsure of how much you can handle. Ask the food to be extra hot because it is sometimes a little at room temperature by the time you start eating it.   5) Food came out quickly after having the order taken. The waiters were doing a good job of asking us if we needed anything. There was so much food and for reasonable prices! For 4 of us, it came out to about $40, so not bad at all, especially considering we had leftovers (leftovers are what students survive on :-P )  6) Service was great. Nice, clean place. Love the minimalistic decor and the restrooms are clean, too. Not too loud and quiet location as the strip mall has always seemed dead whenever we go, despite it having the EOS fitness there. Check out the place sooner than later because it's brand new so it's lesser known yet, but it's gonna be crazyyyy packed--more than it already is!!",

Everything was fresh, good portion size and tasted amazing. Lots of options for meat loves and vegan/vegetarian. A REALLY extensive menu if you are vegan, one of the best I have seen in Vegas.   The staff were a little overwhelmed with how busy it was, but they remained helpful and very friendly. We tried the fresh summer rolls, tom yum soup, and pad woon sen. Summer rolls were fresh, crispy and delicious and came with addictive chili sauce and creamy peanut sauce. Soup was spicy, lemongrassy and delicious. Good chunks of quality chicken. Pad woon sen was full of fresh crunchy veg and had a great flavor. We also had a fresh coconut juice and a butterfly pea lemongrass juice which tasted like the milk after a bowl of Trix (in the greatest way possible!)  Overall an amazing meal and so so so excited to have an excellent Thai option in Green Valley. My new go-to in Vegas.",

The servers were very attentive, and personable! They were very helpful if you needed help with the menu! I can easily bring my vegan friends here to eat after seeing the variety of vegan options they had here! I ordered the chicken pad Thai, and was so pleasantly surprised that the food was absolutely delicious! I'm so happy to have found my new Thai spot, and having it so close to home! I'll definitely be coming back to try the other items on their menu! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Thai food!",

Thai food is by nature very spicy and everything i have experienced here has been lacking and inconsistent even after order a \"hot\" on their scale.  The other problem I have was with their takeout portion size. The first time we went we got takeout for dinner and I ended up having another dinner as a result of a small container being not even 1/4 full for pad see ew. I will finish by saying that i had a brief conversation with a gentleman who represented himself as management at least, and after talking about my thoughts on other local Thai restaurants and he was very receptive and hopeful that Thailicious would exceed expectations. We will give them another try just because i haven't tried the tom yum yet and that will be my final judgement!",

Nice balance of the stuffed crab & cream cheese. The sweet sauce on the side added tremendous value.  Our chicken Tom Ka Gai soup was exactly the way I like it.  Perfect amount of coconut flavor, mushrooms & some green herbs, and served at a temperature ready to eat.  Next, entrees...I always try the Pad Thai at new spots. This one looked great & tasted better. Went with shrimp, which was seasoned just right & the soft noodles cooked to perfection.    Last, but definitely not least, the Green Curry.  I love curry & this is my new favorite.  Layers of flavors with a subtle heat that built as I ate more. Liked it so much that we ordered another with an Avacado Curry to go.  Sooooo yummy.  Finished off with the vegan cheesecake.  Never had a vegan cheesecake & gotta say, it was tasty.  Non dairy whipped cream on top, with some fruit and chocolate sauce.  Perfect sweet ending.  The portion sizes are on the larger side, and the flavors are spot on.  There were extra peppers and spices brought to the table to further season to taste, if need be.  Really though, it wasn't needed. Highly recommend enjoying some meals at this comfy spot.",

We brushed it off however and ended up ordering the Pad Se-Ew & the Pad Thai; vegan. The Pad Thai tasted extremely watered down and flavorless. Absolutely disappointing. Pad Se-Ew was okay. Afterwards, it took FOREVER for them to come back to our table with our check. As soon as we finally gave our check back to pay, she started to get very passive aggressive!! Bad customer service and average food. I really don't see the appeal here.",

So first off, we experienced a slight issue regarding the service, but seeing the busyness of the restaurant and the fact that the issue was fixed, it wasn't really a bid problem. The actual reason I'm writing another review is due to a little issue regarding the quality of food. Now I understand that it's just something that comes with the lunch special, but the egg roll was served cold. The dish was pretty nice and hot, but the egg roll was almost soggy, and you could kind of taste the oil. Another slight issue is about the actually dish, as it was quite a bit saltier than usual, and I have ordered this dish numerous times so I do know what it usually tastes like. As I said, this was the first time such thing has happened, and we have gone at lest 10 or so times, so it may have just been a minor mistake. Nonetheless, the food was still pretty good, I just wish a little bit more care was given into the food.",
