The menu is simple clean and straight forward, no 30 minutes of reading and items blurring together because there so much listed- just simple quality fresh designs with quick turnaround and great presentation.  Again- worth the drive, maxing quality, great presentation, fresh and delicious.",

I know it's hard to be competitive up by where I live and yes some sushi was just okay, but they have a variety of rolls and I just asked the chef to recommend something.  He made me a \"Dont Cry Amigo\" Spicy Hamachi roll and it was just fine and tasty with a kick!  The tempura was nice and light I had two orders... why not it's all you can eat.  For being close to home and the price this place is fine.. but if you're in a super picky foodie night maybe pass.  You know what else helps, they were super nice and gave me good service and that goes a long way too.  Update! I'm totally sick now... :(",

(Though yama sushi is much better) Lobster ramen is too spicy, noodle doesn't taste fresh and broth is okay. (I'd recommend monta ramen for better noodle and broth) Sushi rolls were not fresh at all. Why?   It was disappointing.   I'd still recommend Hachi.",

We came here for lunch, Our server \"Caleb\" greed us and served us. We like him, Super nice person & he make sure if we need anything. Actually all server are really nice there. For starter we order tempura shrimp ($7), tempura have a good flavor. * I ordered Ramen combo $12..  first you choose your ramen (miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, soyu ramen, udon) big portion second you choose your rolls ( california, spicy tuna & 2 other kinds)  third you choose your salad ( cucumber salad or house salad w ginger dressing) * My mom's bestfriend  order Teriyaki chicken bowl (big portion) comes with salad ( choose between cucumber salad or house s ($10), california rolls ($5)  We really like all the food that we ordered. We only eat 1/4 portion from our ramen & teriyaki bowl, it is big portion so we have leftover to bring home.  I will be back soon",

I moved from southwest to very central. This was about a 30-45 minute drive which isn't too crazy if the food were really good. Yelp said it was a 15-28 minute wait when we looked on our way. So, we got there and the hostess told us it's more like 30-45 minutes. So, since I drove that far and still had high expectations (now from a long wait too), I waited in the car to get texted. After about 30 minutes, I decided to sit inside because one person in my 3 people party was disabled so I didn't want to lose our place from how long it takes us to walk in. When we got in, she said about another 15 minutes. About 15 minutes passed, and we were told that there were only 2 people before us. The hostess called a name and my brother said \"I think she's outside.\" the waitress brushed it off and waited a couple minutes before calling the next name. Then after about 5 more minutes we asked how much longer because she had called the two names and she said that we were next. Then, the girl who she called came in and asked how long because she was waiting for a while. The hostess said she texted her and the girl showed her that she never received any texts. After the hostess walked around and lowkey ignored the girl sitting in the waiting room, she sat another group of people and then sat us. 55 minutes of waiting. The sushi was really fast and tasted good. But honestly, the rest of the service sucked. I had to remind them twice about kitchen orders I put in, we asked for more water and they forgot about those too, we were given dishes that had water and dried on crumbs on them, we were kinda disappointed with everything aside from the actual sushi chefs, they were quick and made everything pretty good. Only complaint was the garlic tuna was really dry but we just asked for more sauce on it. So, service was about a C- and I don't plan on coming here again. We ended up taking 3 hours to have dinner here.",

Same local chain with the owners of hwaro, nabe, and sushi neiko. The sushi was comparable to sushi neiko. The wait was almost not existent when I went and would have taken 45 mins at anywhere else. This spot seems a little higher scale compared to neiko but same price range. Great food and atmosphere. The rice to fish ratio was great. Will be bringing my friends by this spot more.",

Even better, more space for me!  I really like the decor, dark and sexy. It's really dim with open space and a couple of booths. May be because we were the only ones there but the it felt really spacious.  Food was fantastic! We tried a couple of rolls and washed it down with blueberry sake. Fish tasted really fresh.  Tried: Anna Roll, Red Bull Roll, Rock N Roll. My absolute favorite was the Rock N Roll, if you like raw fish and cucumber - this roll is for you. I love rice-less rolls and I LOVE raw fish so this was BOMB for me. It comes with a sauce on the side.  The Red Bull roll was really good as well, it comes with jalapeno slices on top which is a \"no thank you for me\" but it was yummy without it. Escolar on top and soft shell crab and cucumber inside wrapped truly fresh rice. My partner in crime for the day got the Anna roll to honor herself :) It was pretty good as well. She also had Toro sushi, which I did not try but she really enjoyed.  There are a few things on the menu that I look forward to coming back and trying. I actually attempted to order lobster ramen to-go the other day and it was going to be a 45 min wait. Ugh! I was next door and did not plan to wait around for 45 min but will definitely come back for it in the near tomorrow.",

To my surprise, they are linked to Sakana and Neko, which were both good choices for ayce sushi. We did go during the ending of their lunch menu and it was't crowded at all. I am sure the foot traffic picks up during dinner as well. We got a booth and it was very spacious and comfortable.  The one major standout here was the service. Excellent customer service sets Umami far apart from establishments like Goemon who have gone downhill due to their lack of service. Our waters were filled often, orders were taken and brought to us in a timely manner, our table and plates were cleaned so often that i felt bad for making them have to stop by our table so often.  The fish was fresh on every different nigiri order as well as their rolls and appetizers. Our server even brought my 5 year old a chopstick holder so she could use her chopsticks instead of a fork.   I can't say enough great things about this place and i guarantee it will be our go to AYCE sushi from now on.",

The sushi is so incredibly fresh and the options are endless. My advice is to take advantage of the AYCE deal. You just can't beat it! I'm currently pregnant and missing my typical sushi orders, but they have a lot of yummy cooked rolls and other great menu options. That way, my husband doesn't have to go sushi-free for 9 months :)",

For this reason, service was SloOOOOoOoow. I kept trying to get workers' attention, and they just kept whizzing by me, even after giving me eye contact. We were hangry to say the least, so I had to take a star off for service. There were maybe 4 other parties at the restaurant at this point.  However, the sushi was worth the wait. It was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced. I ordered a Spicy Tuna, Tamago, and an Alaskan Roll. The size of the rolls are really generous, and I was stuffed by the end! My husband ordered the dinner special-- $13.99 for meat of choice, tempura, california roll, salad, soup, and gyoza. SO much food and a great deal. He couldn't even finish it all!  Overall, I'd definitely return and try it again. I noticed a Help Wanted sign in the window, so hopefully service improves as they get more staff.",

    "text": "I'm so happy there's a decent sushi/ramen place in Centennial Hills. Umami is just up the street from our house, which is AWESOME! My husband and I love this place! We came here on a Thursday night. When you first walk in, you'll notice the dark, sheek decor. The lighting was dim for dinner time. We were greeted by a waitress who seated us right away! You can choose to sit at a table in the dining room or at the bar to watch the sushi chef's make delicious creations.   FOOD   If I could rate this place based only on the food, I would give it 5-stars. Every dish was delicious! We ordered:   1. Wasabi Octopus: Raw octopus w/ a wasabi sauce on top. It'll clear your nostrils as you chew on the tender octopus.   2. Toro Nigiri Special: MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! Get it. It's a special that you'll have to ask your server about.   3. Applejack Nigiri Special: I've never tried the applejack fish before (I also hope to God I heard the lady right when she recommended it). The nigiri came with a sort of ponzu sauce w/ jalapeno's on top. I loved this dish!   4. Tiger Roll: The rolls at Umami are well-balanced that is not rice heavy. It's a simple tiger roll that tasted good since the fish is clearly fresh and the technique used held the entire roll together w/o breaking.   5. Lobster Ramen: The highlight of our meal was the lobster ramen. However, it is spicy!!! This bowl is huge. It's perfect to share. The ramen came w/ a generous serving of noodles, soup, a huge lobster tail, mussels and mushrooms. I recommend ordering this, especially for those who love their Ramen extra spicy. The ramen noodles I've had better elsewhere, but it's still good.   6. Strawberry Champagne Cake: The cake is light, fluffy and semi-sweet. Get this as a dessert to end your meal on a sweet note.   PRICE   Our meal w/ tip was $100 for two people. Umami does not offer an AYCE (All You Can Eat) option. Everything is a la carte. The quality of the food and the generous portion of the Lobster Ramen made it worth the price. I recommend coming here for a special occasion since it is a lot pricier than other sushi restaurants.   SERVICE   The service is the primary reason why I knocked this review down from a 5-star to a 4-star. The service started off great, but they didn't staff properly so when it became busy our waitress forgot about us. We sat there waiting for our check for a good 15 mins before our waitress noticed we didn't get our check yet. Sadly, this is a common issue with new restaurants that cut costs by understaffing. I think as they become more popular it shouldn't be as big of an issue and they'll have a higher budget to staff properly.   Overall, my husband and I loved the food at Umami. The service could be improved. If you come here, be prepared to spend money since it is higher end. The quality of the food, the taste and preparation makes it worth it!   Happy Dining,  J Tran",

My wife ordered Tempura Udon and i ordered Tonkotsu Ramen-----the udon tasted delicious and my ramen was original and unique to this establishment ..and it was  tasty... will come back to this place when we don't want to drive into town for  Japanese food",

    "text": "Went here last weekend after looking at reviews. This place is nice and clean inside. Number 1 thing is they take your order, wait to let you order again and sushi rolls are huge to fill you up quickly. Stack em deep, fill em cheap and get them out. Service was ok,  I had to keep staring at my waiter walking around to order more.  My reason for two stars is due to the food.  Some things are really good but also really easy to make.  Like fried calamari or shrimp tempura is easy and really good. But my gripe is with some food like the bulgogi because it came with ALOT of cabbage in bottom.  You have to eat everything or be charged. The meat was great but alot of unnecessary cabbage. So after apps and WAITING to order again I get into the sushi rolls. These rolls here are freaking huge. Like non traditional size and can't pick up effectively with chops sticks without breaking the roll size. Rolls were good. Toward the end I tried special menu. A mini bowl of curry ramen and a HALF sushi roll. Curry ramen was worse than a pack of ramen from grocery store and no real curry taste. The \"half\" roll was literally the size of a baseball all the way through and I had to ask for a knife to cut it in half. I ordered some other things as well and so did my wife and they did not bring them. I've eaten at 20 star ayce sushi places and this just isnt it. Won't be back but glad I know to avoid at all cost. Sakana or yamada sushi on Maryland Pkwy are better, don't waste your money because it's worth the drive.",

After making us wait a ridiculous amount of time they apologized (there was a mix up) and gave us a small discount but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else.  The bad:  1. We ordered sodas and they brought us cans of sodas. I'm actually fine with the cans, whatever if you can't afford a soda machine. The problem is that you didn't tell me ahead of time that I was paying for a drink that I wouldn't get free refills on. I shouldn't get this type of surprise. 2. The chicken in the dishes was not very good quality, this nice of a place should not have Panda Express level chicken. 3. They should have figured out way earlier that there was a problem with our order. The two people who were eating sushi had already started eating a second round before they even started cooking the other food. Fail.",

We arrived for lunch and was welcomed and seated by Caleb. He informed us that the lobster noodle soup was a dinner item and was not avail during lunch...what???!?, so Caleb checked with the kitchen and yay!, they made it happen...we got to have it and it was yummy. The lobster was perfectly cooked ($17). Sashimi and sushi is fresh! Decor and ambience is very nice. The tuna is the same quality you would get at Nobu. Seriously, Nobu has nothing on this place, Umami is excellent!!! Beef bowl and eel with rice for the kids was delicious. Even the garlic edemame was so good.   Great sushi chefs. Excellent service by Caleb. Other servers were friendly as well.",

    "text": "A great meal of sushi and great typical Japanese style dinner combos in NLV. Went here tonight for the first time and having never been here previously when it was a different owner. Offers a 10% military discount too.   The atmosphere was trendy and spare, with paintings on the walls and in the bathrooms and lots of wood and black, and funnily enough a good amount of upbeat K Pop style music and christmas songs. Great spot for large or small parties of adults for happy hour! Try the pear sake!  Impressed with the level of professionalism given by the new management/owner, who came to my table to discuss when I politely explained that the spicy miso ramen dish I'd ordered was not to my taste.   He wanted to ask why out of curiosity. I've had it before in other places many times before moving to Vegas and I had nothing to hide since I barely ate any of it. Sometimes the taste just isn't what you expect! And he understood but was concerned.   I felt very well taken care of, he even offered to comp my next ramen, which I said was totally unnecessary. I enjoy giving my business to a good place if they treat me well, once I find what I love to eat, and Umami has MANY options.   The new management has similar offerings throughout Vegas in four other restaurants that offer AYCE options, which includes standard nigiri and baked/fried/hand rolls. Crab, lobster, tuna, avocado, cream cheese, ponzu, yum yum and SOS sauce seems to be the go-to on many rolls. I can't hate on it because it works.   I've been frequenting one of the other \"partner\" restaurants, Sakana, a lot recently and having LOVED their options but hated the far drive, finding this place made me happy. The menus are similar and prices, but small differences in presentation and style.   Our waiter, a young Asian man took a while to greet and seat us but when we finally sat five mins after entering what looked to be a nearly empty restaurant we saw that there were only two servers on the floor and a party of 12 on the far side, hidden from the front, and a few others. Also, the entire time our server was not only serving them but also preparing various to-go boxes. Poor guy probably prepped like 5-6 just in the time we were there, maybe for phone orders. He was as attentive as he could be, responding quickly to us and getting help from the other server and food runner.   The rolls we ordered were great, dinner combo worthwhile though I wasn't a fan of the very acidic vinaigrette on the salad that came with the combo. I like mine genuine Japanese style with sesame oil. I ordered one to go as well. Overall, would come back as soon as I can!",

They have large TVs which would be fun on game nights. The waiter was a little quiet, but she was really nice. I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar because the sushi chef were very interactive and nice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS RESTAURANT!  FOOD: The pricing of the food was absolutely perfect for this sushi restaurant, I hope that never changes. They offer different combos that are delicious, filling, and easy on your wallet. The Unagi Don is a large bowl of rice with fresh water eel and eel sauce, it comes with miso soup and a choice of cucumber salad or green salad. The Unagi Don was absolutely delicious, my favorite restaurant that makes it in Vegas. Their Sushi & Sashimi Combo comes with chef selected nigiri and sashimi, in addition you get to choose between a California Roll, Spicy Tuna9 Roll, Salmon and Avocado Roll, or Vegetable Roll. You can also order sushi individually here. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) Nigiri is not only beautiful, but made to perfection. They have a smaller specialty rolls menu, but they all look amazing.  DESSERT: They have a more unique dessert menu compared to other restaurants. For cakes, they have a delicious Champagne Cake or a Cheesecake. I was surprised that they have Macarons here in various flavors such as chocolate, passion fruit, and pistachio. As a Japanese restaurant, it's only fitting that they have Mochi Ice Cream in most flavors. Additionally, they have Affogato which is vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso.  DRINK: They have a full sake menu. Their hot tea comes in a cute teapot. They have the basic fountain drinks.",

    "text": "I took my family to Umami for dinner after we watched a movie.  Thing I liked: -Spicy Miso Ramen: no doubt it was my favorite dish. It was more a Korean style ramen rather than Japanese one but nonetheless it was good. I enjoyed the soup base, the spicy level was perfect for me; it had heat but not burning. The flavor reminded me of my favorite Korean instant noodle, Nongshim Shin Ramyun. It had plenty vegetable and the slices of pork was tasty.  Things were just okay: -Sushi: we ordered shrimp, Unagi, tuna roll. The sushi rice was a little bland; could use a little more seasoning in the rice, I would like a little more vinegar taste in the rice. Unagi was different than the ones from other restaurants, didn't have sauce on it but actually not bad.  -Teriyaki beef combo: it was a big bento box. It came with miso soup, fried dumplings, salad, California roll, rice, tempura shrimp and veggies, and the beef. The beef was average, the dumplings probably were from manufacturer. It was okay but they gave us a lot of food. -Tonkotsu ramen: the soup base was a little bland but the noodle was fine and firm. I liked the fried tofu that was in the bowl and plenty of veggies.  -Service: it wasn't bad and busboy was working hard, refilling water and cleaning out the table. One complaint that after dinner we realized that the server only brought us one miso soup. We ordered two combos so we should have two.   Things I didn't like: -Fried pork cutlet combo: Basically the same as the beef teriyaki combo except the protein. The pork was really dry and tough. They over cooked quite a bit. - KFC(Korean fried chicken): the dish was greasy and chicken pieces weren't crispy actually a little soggy. And I didn't like the sauce in it. Everyone tried a piece and no one went back for more, we didn't finish the chicken.  Overall I still don't have a go to sushi place around my neighborhood but whenever I want a nice bowl of noodle soup I'll be back at Umami.",

Most of appetizers and sushi (salmon belly) tasted Wonderful!! But we had to wait for rolls which I understand that it was really busy night. Hannah always comes back with such a great smile and guiding us that what we should try and the Manager Tyler was on top of everything that everytime when I was about to ask something he brings it out right away and tries to talk to us all the time and suggesting what we should try and even I heard him talking to other tables right next to me that he was making sure everything was okay and checking it up all the customers with professionalism.

If you go with a big group of friends (maybe 6-8 people) you can all share the food and maybe even get through the whole meal. It's a fun adventure ordering all the items on the menu.   They have a lot of pricy items on the menu. Those items are limited to one order per person. I definitely recommend those items. The unagi nigri, soft shell crabs, raw oysters, and poke are great seafood option to order.   Lunch is about $20 per person AYCE. Dinner is around $25 (but most likely closer to $30ish after tax and tip). Even though it's seems pricey, it's definitely worth the price since sushi in general is expensive. Here you can eat all the fresh seafood. More bang for your buck here.",

    "text": "Was driving all around trying to finish up my things to do and the last stop was in the Centennial area. Was already hungry and felt like eating rice. Was having white rice withdrawals after being in Utah for 5 days. So sushi was it, all comes with rice.   Yelp had Umami at the beginning of the list and was the closest to where I was at. The ratings go from one end to the other so I wanted to decide for myself.   Got there and when I walked in, was immediately greeted by the staff. Love it.   Was seated and there were about eight other groups already there. Was a late lunch at about 2:30pm.   I went with the AYCE option and the menu was loaded on both sides. Ordered a bunch of stuff from rolls to grilled items. Everything smelled and tasted fresh. Some would say the fish was previously frozen but I say so what. The prices didn't reflect the high prices of fresh seafood so all is good.   The best part is the person making my sushi didn't try to load me up with a lot of rice. The fish pieces were large and in charge. Only thing missing was a dab of wasabi between the fish and rice. I can see where some people might not like that so this was no big deal.   The best part was at the end where I ordered the tempura ice cream. The way they do it here is the best. The coating was light and crispy. The ice cream was still relatively intact after being deep fried, sliced open and filled with whipped cream and topped with a cherry.   I would definitely go back again when in the area. The service was excellent and friendly.",

    "text": "UPDATE: It's been a few months since I last ate here and the quality of this place has gone down. I'm only giving it 3 Stars because of our server Lindsay. She was very sweet and friendly. But as far as the food, it WAS NOT the same as before. First, our cups were cheap-lookin paper cups. I noticed that the regular hard plastic cups they had before was only used for soft drinks. As for the nigiri sushi, they put way too much rice. Before, the rice was very minimal and we loved it because that meant we could eat way more. The tempura (shrimp and rolls) was not fresh. It tasted like it was an extra batch and was left sitting out until an order came through. Some of our favorite sushi rolls were made completely different. The Chanel roll didn't have as much flavor. The Stuft Tomatoes was way too spicy with the new sauce they drenched the rolls in. The Yuzu Yellowtail had bigger pieces of jalapeno which overpowered the other flavors. The edamame wasn't even salted. And towards the end of the night we had to ask for water 3 times til we were given some. This was our go-to place for sushi. I really wana give this place another try on the off-chance that it might've been just one of those nights. I'm really rooting and hoping for this because this time was a disappointment.",

In a way, I'm disappointed in myself because we live very close and we have neglected Umami for another sushi spot down the road.   Service: 5/5. Insanely fast, attentive, and nice. This was the fastest service I've experienced and it made the experience much more pleasant.   Food: 5/5. We both did the all you can eat, which is the way to go. The sushi was likely the best sushi I have had and everything was fresh.   -- Started off with Egg Rolls. Not much to say about these other than that they were solid. To be honest, I'm not sure if there is such thing as a bad egg roll  -- I ordered the \"Red Dragon Roll\" and the \"Dancing Eel Roll.\" Both were amazing. I ended up ordering another Dancing Eel Roll.   -- My girlfriend ordered the \"Snow in Vegas Roll\" and the \"Dragon Roll.\" She really enjoyed them both.   -- We finished with an app called \"The Shit\" and my girlfriend got some strawberry mochi. The Shit was the shit. I believe it was baked spicy zucchini sticks stuffed with spicy crab.   Overall, you have to come here. Especially if you live in the Northwest Vegas area!",

We have been twice and have sat at the sushi bar both times, which is my recommendation. The chefs are so helpful and creative. Both times we had the live lobster sashimi and it did not disappoint!!!! All the sashimi and sushi was fabulous!!! We had hamachi, kanpachi, sake, ocean trout, bluefin tuna, scallops. We went with what the chef recommended on most part and it was great!!!! I really loved the garlic edamame as well.  We haven't ordered much from the kitchen but they have a pretty good menu as far as that goes.  The lobster ramen looks amazing, I gotta make a trip out for lunch soon!",

We went 15 minutes after 3pm so we got stuck with the dinner price for al you can eat. The menu is large so many plus's to that and the wait staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is fun and cool as well. I'd like to see them busier but hey I was there at 3pm. I would recommend the pang for starts and the kiss of fire! Can't wait to come back here to update this review!! I just had to write one to let everyone know it's under new management and they now offer a lot more options.

I promise y'all won't be disappointed.",

We like to try new sushi often but will continue to go to one place in particular because no other sushi place is as good as them. Umami is most definitely as good! This restaurant will be our new sushi spot. The location is perfect and the sushi was fantastic. Good quality, presentation, service, atmosphere, everything. Going back tonight!",

Constant checkups and drink refills.    Kudos to the waiter that serviced me, I was a bit inquisitive asking many questions regarding items on the menu.

Same area as Buffalo Wild Wings/Zaba's  What you should order: Depends what you're feeling...pretty wide variety here, from sushi to Ramen and even hot entrees too...  We started off with some Wasabi Tako and Amberjack Yuzu Truffle which was very tasty. We also split the Lobster Ramen which had spiny lobster tail, shrimp, scallop, mussel, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms and scallions and a very generous portion of noodles.  Great flavors, but be prepared for some heat as it is in a spicy seafood broth.  You can't come here and not order sushi??? Wifey got an Avocado Roll, I had to have my Uni, and we got the Ocean Trout off the specials board...we were undecided on a roll on the  menu, so Chef Kim offered to make us a special no-name roll which had soft shell crab and shrimp tempura inside, wrapped in soy paper,  and topped with salmon and hamachi. All sushi tasted very good, generous cuts, and we were stuffed!  There's an Entree section that offers stuff like Chilean Sea Bass, Korean Shortribs, and  Hanger Steak if you're not feeling the raw stuff.  We got their popular Strawberry Champagne Cake and an Affogato to share. Cake was like boxed mix and I didn't taste any champagne,  but it was made with real buttercream. Good first visit,  and thank goodness for this place, because there's very slim pickings for sushi up here in the hills! Just be prepared to pay more than all you can eat prices because everything here is a la carte...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

    "text": "This place has a great ambiance to it! Great friendly workers! Love the customer service that this place has!   As for the sushi, they have a huge variety and have the option of AYCE. We tried so many, but the roll I remember most was the Bam Bam roll! I absolutely enjoyed that roll and all the other rolls we ordered. They definitely do not skimp put on the fish neither! My all time favorite is the yellow tail. All in all you can't go wrong at this place. Everything from the udon noodles down to the sushi was delicious!   The only downside was that I wish there were more \"real\" sushi on the menu, meaning more variety of raw fish in their rolls. There were salmon, tuna and spicy tuna that wefe in the rolls. So for those who can't eat raw, this is the place for you.  Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again.",

There were drink specials and Marcelo our waiter was outgoing and made amazing food and drink suggestions which was appreciated. Orders are submitted on an iPad and comes out lightning fast.

As a sushi connoisseur myself, I truly believe that all sushi restaurants are the same, more or less, most sushi restaurants all taste the same to me. But Umami sets the bar. They are fast and the fish quality is great!  My husband and I come here once a week (Yes, once a week... I think the waiters and sushi chefs know us). You would think going that often one would be sick of sushi, but they have a wide variety of menu selections, the options are not limited. They offer rice/meat bowls, poke, and sushi burritos as well. Their all you can eat pricing is about $21 for lunch and $26.00 for dinner.  I would drive across town from Henderson to Centennial Hills just to get Umami sushi!",

All of the staff are super friendly, fun, and on the ball with your orders. Total 180, so major kudos to the new manager and the staff, especially Ceazer who is a rock star.  They also upgraded the decor and music so it doesn't feel like you're eating in a Soviet gulag playing nu-metal to torture its prisoners. Much more inviting, and the music is mostly k-pop, which is fun. The seating also got changed to accommodate more people.  The food is still amazing with the most generous fish to rice ratio in the northwest, and always fresh fish. Their uni is flat out outstanding for AYCE. Only small food complaint is the tempura there needs work. It tends to be pankcakey instead of light and kinda greasy as it should be. It's gotten a bit better, but it's got a ways to go.  Get your butt over there and tip your servers well!",

    "text": "Came here last night with the wife for a good late Friday night dinner in Vegas.  It was pretty busy when we came around 9 PM as last order in is at 10:30 PM and neither of us really wanted to be rushed.  Maybe it gets a lot more crowded during peak dining times but no real worries there.  They even had people coming in after 10(close at 11) wanting to sit and they did warn them about not having a whole lot of time to dine.  The food is good and I must say that the nigiri we got had extra large pieces of fish on it compared to the amount of rice under which is always a good thing.  This is the 2nd place we have gone to where there is an item menu called *the Shit* and while not as good as the other, I would never complain about it.  The menu is quite extensive especially with the appetizers and the above mentioned nigiri fish.  The only thing I was not a huge fan of was I tend to order a plate of daikon radish and the chef kind of put like 3 times the amount I usually get so I really hated wasting what I could not finish because of everything else.    If you come early or very late,  you can actually get a chance to talk to your server about whatever without them trying to rush off and make tip money from other customers.",

Our server is especially friendly and easy to talk to and our orders always come out in a timely manner.  This is probably the best AYCE sushi this side of town in our opinion.  I think what makes this place a winner is the fish to rice ratio.  They don't overload your nigiris with a huge amount of rice and the fish is fresh.  This is probably the number one reason why we keep coming back here and the fact that its so close to home.  No need to drive down to Chinatown for some good sushi.     Not only is the sushi here pretty good but the service that we have received has always been impeccable from the sushi chefs down to the waiters.  The husband is always striking conversations with them.  Too much sometimes that I have to nudge him and tell him to chill out and let them work LOL. But what can I say, he loves to talk...and take shots ;)  The ambiance of the restaurant itself is like most other sushi restaurants.  We especially like the big japanese mural that they have on wall.  Parking itself can be pretty tight but we've never had any issues personally with finding parking.  Definitely a good ayce sushi spot this side of town.",

The nigri was absolutely delicious. Perfect portions and everything we ate was delicious!   I recommend sticking to Japanese style food and getting the fresh wasabi to go with your meal.

Their rolls are diverse in choices and choices. I recommended the Batman hand roll, very tame and subtle but a nice addition to the table. The fish is fresh and flavorful and you wont help yourself but order multiple nigiri and rolls. The eel sauce in the unagi is nicely done, that's why I ended up getting a lot of them. The side dishes and appetizers are also good options, like the calamari and fried gyoza, and the beef fried rice is also a good option. Their desserts are also pretty diverse; they have the usual option of ice cream and mochi but they also have the honey toast and fried bananas which I really appreciate. Overall, the experience is great and would highly recommend it. The only thing I guess I took the star off of is the location; but that's just me since I live at the Valley and often used to great places for sushi at Chinatown. Of course the place has a lot of regulars, but honestly even if it's a long drive I would not mind going back here again.",

There were multiple 2 tops open, yet we waited for 10 minutes, meanwhile another party of 2 and then a party of 7 came in. This seemed to fluster everyone and instead of seating us they waited until more tables cleared and set up for the party of 7. Then hostess finally comes back and says \"who is the next party of 2?\" and I say we are--since we most definitely were--then a woman behind me says no they were here first. Her husband corrects her, however, hostess shouldn't even ask that, she should know who is next. Then I see her seat the party of 7 before that other couple who was there first, then finally them. What is important as a hostess is to stagger when you seat people and not all at once so server and kitchen doesn't get overloaded with a bunch of orders going in at the same time.  Anyways, thank goodness the food came out really fast and was delicious. Crispy rice has a super tiny amount of spicy tuna unfortunately, but what there was tasted amazing. My husband really liked his \"I Love Lobster\" roll, just beware menu says it is 8 pieces but it is really 5.  Will probably return because the food tasted great, just hope the service will be better next time.",

We did expect a little bit of wait but there wasn't the usual front of counter person. I had to eventually flag one of the servers to help is out and be placed on a list which was unfortunate since another server had a list of his own. The overall feel and ambiance of the restaurant is no longer here since we've visited the restaurant previously and to my count this was our fifth time.",

I got a cucumber salad (yum!), a giant hand roll, and a huge bowel of ramen.  I think I ate MAYBE 1/2 the food.  Probably less.  It was easily two meals for me.    Everything was well flavored and well cooked.  The noodles had a nice bite to them and the broth was really flavorful.  I went with four stars instead of five because I would have liked an option for a smaller lunch portion at a lower price point.  It was just so much food... and a little more than I like to pay for lunch.  BUT, simply based on the food - five stars.  If you're hungry for Japanese food, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",

It's a cool, contemporary spot--the samurai wall painting is a great backdrop.  Darin was our server who made sure service was top-notch. We started with the king crab and lobster ngiri, which were that day's specials. Both were delicious and generous; the lobster especially tasted like FRESH lobster, not an overbrined version that some places serve. Then we were going to have separate lunch special bowls of ramen, but because we already had sushi and were getting another roll plus pickled cukes, Darin mentioned that the ramen bowl was very large and filling and asked if we wanted to split it. Good thing we followed his lead because we would have wasted so much--instead, it was a perfect serving of umami miso ramen for each.  BFF received a beautiful complimentary tempura ice cream cake dessert served topped off with a birthday candle!  I felt prices were reasonable for the selections and quality, as our lunch bill was only $35, not including tip.  BFF is bringing her guy here and I'm taking hubby along next visit, too.",

Awesome food, they have similar if not same type of popular rolls from other locations. The tempura calamari is delicious with tempura shrimp! This experience was amazing. We had 5 all you can eat and 2 of them did Ramen as well! ( They always ask you if your sure! ) lol don't doubt your food. It's delicious and you guys with just saying it's a Bday you guys made it a experience we will never forget! The desert was awesome!! And a great surprise!

When we got there they had a beautiful table set up to fit all 9 of us comfortably. The service is some of the best I have had in a  sushi place we never had empty drinks and the food kept on coming. The food was also amazing the sushi was all fish hardly any rice. Some of the best sushi we have had. At the end of our dinner they brought the birthday boy a beautiful dessert and sang to him. He loved it! Thank you so much for making my boys 8th birthday amazing. I wish I could give you guys 10 stars.",

The food was delicious and fresh. They have various kinds of menu selection. I'd highly recommend their fresh oyster, salmon kama, yuzu yellowtail, and salmon smoked paprika. I've tried a couple AYCE sushi places in Vegas but I'd say Umami is my favorite one! All the servers were very attentive and friendly. They came up to our table to see if everything was alright, bussed empty dishes right away which I was really impressed by. I'll definitely come back",

I am allergic to shellfish and the waiter helped me pick out a few that I would be able to have. You need to try the Bam Bam Roll!!  The Spicy Garlic Edamame is delicious!  The sauce served with the gyoza is delicious too. Their version of Bulgogi is good too; it has a sweet taste to it but it is delicious.   They offer a military discount of 10% too.

I had to fight back tears when I quickly recognized the menu from Sushi Neko. It's my favorite ayce in Vegas. Now I have the wonderful luxury of this place being right down the road from my house. Everything I ordered was exactly like ordering from Sushi Neko. The insane rice to fish ratio, the variety of no-rice rolls, the amazing nigiri sauces, and \"the shit.\" I love the salmon belly nigiri, smoked paprika salmon, super white, scallop, and garlic tuna. The shit and shrimp tempura are favorites too. There's not one bad thing I can say about my visit here. My waiter, Carlos was fun and suggested other menu items he thought we'd like. He was spot on!

When I ate here I started with a bottle of sake like I normally do at sushi restaurants. My sake came a long piece of hair in it. The sushi I ordered was very oily to the point It completely ruined the taste. The service was ok but I would recommend Krazy sushi that is down the street or Sapporo Revolving sushi that's not too far from this restaurant.",

Not only is the fish fresh and far superior to any buffet style eatery out there but there is sincere thought put into every dish from the presentation to the sauce. Even the simple edamame appetizer is exploding with flavor. The chef here tastes pride in his work and it shows. You can't go wrong getting any of their sushi but if you want to try their other dishes, the Chilean Sea Bass is worth every penny.",

When it came down to the day of the anniversary, we couldn't figure out where to go, and decided against going to the strip. We were looking for something light and not terribly expensive.  Umami was near where we were staying and the Yelp reviews were good.  Maybe it's because we are from Seattle and have good sushi all around, but I kind of felt \"meh\" about Umami.  It was SO dark inside that we could barely even see the menus or what we were eating--I've been in dark restaurants but it was kind of ridiculous.  And it started out kind of strange because it took a long time for anyone to take our order, even though the place was almost empty and we didn't get refills on our iced teas.  The sushi was good--we had a sushi appetizer, and I had the lobster ramen and husband had a fish dish (cooked).  It's been a couple of months so I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember that we wished that there was some sort of combination where we could try a couple of different things.  We ended up switching meals halfway through because my ramen, while good, was VERY spicy.  We both enjoyed the fish very much.  Overall the food was fairly good, service was kind of mediocre,",

    "text": "Finally! A delicious Japanese restaurant in the Durango, Northwest area!  Restaurant is quiet, clean, not much decor inside; very simple.  Food is really yummy! Their menu offers sooo many types of Japanese rolls - from raw to baked to fried. They have lunch and dinner 'combos', noodles, rice bowls, soups, salads. They also offer an All You Can Eat on all the rolls! If you're not a voracious eater, you can go the a la carte way.  We came around lunch time. The place wasn't filled up but we had to wait a couple of minutes before we were seated as there were only 2 hosts working that time. But once we got seated, service was fast. We didn't have to wait too long for the food. I'd say our food was served in less than 15 minutes; the rolls just a tad bit longer but it was soooo good it was worth the wait.  Price wise ($-$$), it's almost the same as other Japanese or sushi restaurants that have similar menu.  Highly recommend to visit and try!",

A nice change of pace from where we usually go, but at the same time it wasn't \"outstanding\". Fairly typical. I feel I want to try to eat here again to better gauge how their food is. However, the fish to rice ratio really stood out above other places. Everything came out at a reasonable pace and even surprisingly quick at points. We went around 5:30 so even though people were there it wasn't crazy. The prices are average, but I do think the place we typically go is slightly more expensive by maybe a dollar or two. At the end of our meal is when more people started rolling in and you could tell come the usual dinner hour they probably get pretty busy. I'm curious to see how the service is during busier hours. All in all dinner left me with a curiosity to try to them again, but they don't particularly stand out so far.",

Lot of space, beautifully and professionally decorated.  It looks very upscale. The staff was nice.   The food was not great, but not bad either. We ordered sushi, tempura ice cream, ramen, and karaage chicken. The sushi rice was a tad colder and harder than what we're used to. Fish was OK. Chicken was warm and not piping hot as most other good places. But the sauce was very interesting and delicious.   Service was work in progress. It was very busy. And our dishes were taking a bit longer. One was completely forgotten.  And other guests' dishes were repeatedly offered to us.   We will give it another chance once the dust settles.",

They have great lunch and dinner specials and the staff is fantastic.  The other night when we were there a lady was trying to do the All You Can Eat and feed all of her kids on the 1 ticket. Umami management told her that she couldn't do that, she blew a gasket and left.  The Umami manager came over and explained the situation to us since we were sitting close. He didn't have to do that because we already understood and felt Umami was right.  Later he comp'd us a few generous items. YEAH!!  Anyway, Umami food and sushi is great, I love the atmosphere and it is now my regular sushi place!  Cheers to Umami!",

Looking forward to trying out more of the menu items. Two thumbs up.",

Didn't say hello, didn't smile, just asked for our drink order and left without saying a word. She came back about 5 minutes later to bring our drinks & without saying anything she left them on the table & ignored our \"thank you\" & left. The restaurant was pretty empty, 5 tables including ours,  & 4 employees just lounging around. Server after server would walk around aimlessly, ignoring us and avoiding us. At one point one server was at the front cleaning menus, and another started to buss a table rather than approach us even though most of the restaurant tables were clean and open in case anyone happened to walk in. after 15 minutes we just got up to leave. No inquiry as to why we were clearly displeased and no goodbye on our way out. The servers acted like they did not give a damn so we didn't even stay to eat.",

Our server was confused be cause we kept asking for the mimi ramen and I guess it was a typo, it was supposed to be mini ramen ha! The pace looked nice, modern decorations. They had a large screen TV showing show with Japanese chefs making sushi. It was interesting but seeing fish and squid being gutted while you eat is not my first choice of shows to watch during dinner.  Service was good all the other servers seem to help out other tables.

    "text": "One of my favorite AYCE sushi spots! Same owner/menu as sakana over by UNLV.  I like the selection of appetizers and sushi.  Fish to rice ratio for sushi pieces is excellent...meaning very little rice.  I don't usually eat rolls since there is too much filler and not enough fish.  For sushi selections, the salmon belly, unagi, seared salmon are my favorite nigiri.  I like that they also have riceless options or options wrapped in cucumber.  A little different than other spots that I didn't see a specials list for the day. The service was excellent and there was always someone checking to see if I needed to place more orders.  The kitchen was a little slow when I was there...so appetizers took much longer than nigiri.  I noticed some differences from Sakana.  The towering sashimi poke came out on tortilla chips and not wonton chips...a little weird tasting honestly.  One suggestion, the crab nigiri is one big imitation crab stick.  I would suggest doing a crab salad nigiri which would look a lot better than the one long stick on a piece of rice.  They were also out of hamachi kama and kurobata sausage the night I went.  I hope it's not a regular occurrence where they are out of items.  I get the hamachi kama is seasonal.  Seating was a little awkward, the tables were so close together, tables had to be moved for people to get in or get out of adjacent tables.  Also, orders kept getting mixed up and placed on adjacent tables.  Overall, the food is good and I like that they are on yelp so I can check wait time and put my party on the wait list as I drive over.  Kid friendly, it's pretty loud, so will drown out any crying children haha!",

On previous reviews there are picture of dinner type entrees which is why it made us stop.   After waiting for about 20-30 on a very hungry stomach is when we realized they didn't have a typical dinner menu. Yet the waiter was fairly attentive and suggested a steak teriyaki dish. We decided to stay. My husband had two plates of the suggested dishes. So he obviously enjoyed.   I had a couple of issues with my sushi orders. A couple of wrong orders being delivered. One that took super long to arrive. As to my 4 star rating.   Overall the food was yummy and the service was okay for being a busy night.   Ps: i always get overwhelmed with the amount of sushi selection. I LOVE sushi but there are several topping that are a no no for me, so I would love to see a sushi place implement a build your own sushi. I know there are those chipotle style sushi places but it's not the same experience and ayce.",

For $22 before 3pm, you can have all the sushi you can eat. This is not junky stale fish: it was fresh and prepared to order (and quickly!) take a look at the menu: they have the widest selection we've ever seen.   The only odd thing is twice when we ordered hamachi, we got Kama instead of nigiri. That's what happens when the selection is so broad, you have to be specific. Hamachi Kama was a first for us: a cooked hamachi tail and rather delicious.   So do what we did: skip breakfast, jump on your plane to Vegas and stop here on your way out of town to the national parks. It's a great way to start a road trip!",

The servers are so nice and accommodating. My 2 year old is a very picky eater. We ordered her teriyaki but she chose not to eat that that day. The server was kind enough to comp the food she didn't eat and helped us find something on the menu that she would eat. We had success with the fried rice.  Just this effort alone is what impressed me to want to continue coming back. Only bad thing I can say is that my shoes stuck to the floor when walking through the dining area which is kind of displeasing but I'm able to look past it.. for now...",

(I prefer an immaculate sushi restaurant...I mean, you know, RAW food being prepared).  The service is fine.  Did not stand out, but they were not rude.  It was nice of the chef to send over some dishes for free, as part of my group's AYCE.  But it was just not a place that I would feel comfortable returning to all the time.  The dishes were good, though.  We liked the fatty tuna (the chef special).  We liked the yellow tail and tuna.  We liked this one roll that was spicy, with cheese, avocado, and fried shrimp.  We liked this \"Christmas\" roll that had green and red sprinkles on top.  All in all, pretty good.",

Food: I'm vegan, so veggie rolls for me. Hubby is not vegan, but he loves this place more than I do. Very good food overall! Good rice to sushi ratio. They have a Wonder Woman roll that is fried shitake mushroom, cucumber, avocado inside and fish on top, but for extra $1 they modified it for me with avocado on top instead of fish (I'll try to attach a photo here). Beautiful and so delicious! Mini udon is vegan friendly. They also have skewers - mushroom, tofu. A few other items like edamame and seaweed salad for my vegan/vegetarian friends. I'm trying to encourage them to get a little vegan menu. ;) I'll be here way more often then!  Presentation: On point! Sharp, clean and elegant. Definitely gets the tastebuds going.   Vibe: Modern, dark colors, Japanese fusion with a sports bar. Really cool looking mural on one of the walls. A couple of booths, tables and of course sushi bar.   Service: Very friendly and accomodative staff. Didn't mind at all to check on preparation of certain foods for me. Very pleasant. Always served us very quickly.",

It's now ayce \"all you can eat\" for $26.99.  We were skeptical but we were so close and decided to give it a try. Since it was their first day of the menu change nobody knows the menu not even the sushi chef. Ordered 1st round and some items were good and most were not, the Uni was brown and watery, fish freshness was sketchy. Ordered something called \"honey screaming O\", suppose to be salmon with crab stick but what came out was seared tuna over radish. Unami fried rice was bland, needed salt or soy sauce. Bacon wrapped scallop all bacon can't even taste the scallop. Baked scallop roll barely had any scallop on top. They need to work out their kinks, oh wait it's more like knots.",

One was the Carson roll which had soft shell crab, scallops, tuna, salmon, avocado and cucumber (so good)! The other roll was the Red Bull roll which had the soft shell crab, spicy crab, escolar, avocado, jalapeno and cucumber (my personal fave). Overall very good! Coming back for more!",

    "text": "This new spot in town has my number! I came here tonight for a late dinner with my girlfriend and we were not disappointed in the least.  It was slow for a Friday night but being late I understand that could be the case in this quieter part of vegas. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated.  I personally like the bar so we found a nice corner. Drink orders were taken immediately and here we go.  The rundown: I ordered the screaming o and a no. 5 roll. Screaming o was placed with the waitress and came first and the attentive chef took my order for the roll which he made before my eyes.  The screaming o is a staple for me. I love it, it's great. Ask anyone that knows me, it's fantastic. In this preparation the chef portioned out the radish to fit the plate, then sliced it by the portion and proceeded to lay the tuna slices over it and drizzle the sauce. This struck me as different because when eating it ensured that each bite had the right ration of fish to radish to sauce with no biting and navigating of long pieces that typically would be nested on the plate. Rich, fresh, thoughtful. Everything I wanted.  The no. 5 roll has Cajun albacore and cucumber inside with spicy tuna and crispy onion on top with a light saucing. This was amazing in flavor and generous in fish. You could taste the Cajun albacore even under the topping and onion. A big bite for sushi but well composed.  All this with a Sapporo makes for a treat meal.  My friend tried my selections and loved the screaming o but was terrified of the roll, she is a bit vanilla. Her order was a California roll and gyozas and she was satisfied. The chef made us a delicious special after seeing the difference in our orders. It was a cut scallop bite with truffle oil and a fried garlic slice on top. It was so perfectly tender and the sweet hint of the scallop shined through.  All in all I was incredibly impressed and will be back!",

We instantly thought the place was classy and very cute. We were greeted right away, and let me say our waitress was amazing ! Nina, she was a great host , we took a min to order but she was patient and came back every couple mins to see if we were ready. Besides the wonderful service from Nina, the food was delicious! From the sake to the sushi it was tasty food ! Go there eat, and by all means ORDER THE STRAWBERRY CHAMPAGNE CAKE!",

They did apologize for it and did refund me for the ramen. For the establishment itself, the tables are too close together, the next table over had their kid banging their silverware on our table. That's how close it is. The TV volumes are too loud. You have to yell to hear the person sitting across the tiny table. The poor waitress for our table had her hands chapped up so bad it looked painful.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with this place, especially seeing yelpers have given this place on an average 4.5 stars.   A 4.5 star restaurant should have excellent ambiance, excellent food, excellent service. This Umami place has none of the above.  First the ambiance, it is quite mod but cold. Seats are not comfortable and has many TV's. Is this really a Japanese restaurant or just a sports bar serving Japanese food??  Service is horrible not because the servers tried to ignore us, rather, they need to be trained: 1. There were empty tables along the wall and the aisle, instead, the seater took us to a table right in the middle of the room with empty tables all around us. Strange. 2. Three servers came to us to take drink orders and desert orders seems to be totally un-organized.  3. We ordered some sushi rolls. We have to ask for Wasabi and ginger which were not accompanied with the rolls. We should not have to ask for them -- it is a must condiment with sushi.  4. We asked for low sodium soy sauce. The waitress said there should be one in the kitchen but then she came back and said all the soy sauce they use are of the low sodium variety.  5. Server did not seem to know the menu well -- has to go and ask the chef/manager constantly. Annoying. Although all the servers were friendly and courteous, there is a lot of training to be done.  Now come to the food: A good Japanese restaurant must have good sushi rice as well as regular rice ( that come with the entrees ). This restaurant's rice is obnoxiously bad -- when sushi rice is hard and under-cooked, you just won't have good sushi.  We also ordered the BBQ short ribs. Way too much Korean BBQ sauce on those ribs.   Pricing on the food items is disproportionate. Classic rolls are only $6 each. But specialty rolls are about $15 each or more. Why such difference.   Based on the sushi rice, this place is not worth any thing more than a 1.5 star, but since there is no half star category,  we  give this place a 2 star which is being very kind.",

My boyfriend and I had been there before the management change and we absolutely loved it so when we went back we already knew what we wanted only to find those items were no longer available. It is now an all you can eat and the quality has really gone down. If we hadn't already ordered drinks we would have left based on how different the menu is. It's very off putting to have the same name but have everything different. If you have never been there before, give it a try since you don't have the original to compare it to. I will say they they are attentive and making sure everyone is taken care of so that was good! However, if you have been there before the management change you will be highly disappointed. As I am sure you will see from other reviews. I don't see us coming back.",

    "text": "Super bummed after leaving this place tonight! One of my best friends and I ate here a week ago and absolutely LOVED our experience! We came in at an off time but still during lunch and was greeted and waited on by the most darling girl! She was so sweet, attentive but not hovering, and just good at her job! The food was fabulously prepared and tasted amazing! We left there SO happy about our experience, with satisfied bellies, and couldn't wait to bring our husbands back! We both raved to them about this new place and were excited to bring them back to try it! Tonight was it. The food tasted great but the husbands were not impressed. They didn't seem to find anything exceptionally special on the menu and what they ordered was just okay. But that wasn't the worst part.....when trying to pay our bill, the staff informed us our card had been declined. It didn't make sense as we were both positive we had the proper funds. Even after checking our accounts and confirming that, our card declined again. After trying a separate card and having that also decline, they realized it was their system and began trying to figure it out. After at least 30 minutes of going back and forth and trying to pay our bill, they gave us 2 options. Either pay cash (which we didn't have), or leave our card number, expiration date, and name with them to run it when the system came back up! Ummmmm no?! You want me to give you my credit card information?! No. Well, with 2 babies (8 mo old with us, 2.5 yr old at home with grandparents) that needed to go to bed, it was already insanely late and this was just taking more time. The manager had already left for the night I guess, and I wasn't going to leave my credit card info. So I had to leave my husband there, rush a crying baby home to put him to bed, send my dad back to the restaurant with cash so he could pay, JUST as the system came back up...of course. All of this trouble and absolutely NOTHING offered from the staff or manager. The manager has supposedly been contacted so it's not like she was unaware. It's not my fault their system is down and they can't accept my payment. Being someone in the business of customer service, I'm VERY frustrated with our experience tonight and my husband has made it EXTREMELY clear, we will not be returning to this establishment. As a brand new business, it doesn't look good on their watch. Sad, but we won't be back anytime soon!",

    "text": "This is our second time eating here. It's always my wife, my 6 year old daughter and I. The first time we ate here the owner gave us a complimentary bottle of sparkling peach saki which was amazing. The service is perfect and everyone is beyond friendly. This time we ordered a la carte for my daughter and the owner offered for her to eat free off our all you can eat. Granted she doesn't eat much but that's awesome customer service and something you never see at a sushi spot. The chef sent over a bear made out of a orange for my daughter which put a huge smile on all our faces. How can you beat that! Let me comment on the sushi real quick. The best way to put it is it's the exact opposite of what your use to. What I mean is we are use to getting large portions of rice and smaller portions of fish. At Umami it's the exact opposite. Huge portions of fish on small portions of rice. It's dang near nigiri lol. My wife and I had our first date a sushi tachi on centennial and Aliante and that has been our sushi spot for 9 Years. With out a doubt Umami is now our new favorite spot. The sushi is amazing and has the biggest variety by far out of any of the sushi spots we've been to. Great job guys! Customer for life!",

    "text": "UPDATE December 2017: This sushi place used to be our go to place (see previous 5 star review below). However, it was recently (around October 2017) taken over by new management. The prices are more afordable and you can expect to receive slightly more meat per order. However, the two things that really set the old Umami apart for me was the quality of the fish (and other food) and great service. Both have gone down noticably under new management (therefore the new 2 star review). For this reason I will be finding a new sushi place to frequent.  OLD REVIEW February 2017: If you are looking for a sushi place in the Centennial Hills area this is the place to go, without question. This place takes the spot as one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas. Every fish that we tasted was incredibly FRESH including the salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and the snapper. Both times that we went here we chose to sit at the sushi bar. Where we enjoyed our very quick one on one service from sushi chef Kim. Kim made various recommendations and came off as very knowledgeable. After our main meal; we chose to try the mochi and macaroons which were great as well! Each of the two times we've been here it was a great date experience in a restaurant with a great atmosphere. You won't find an all you can eat option here, but the food is well priced and after you have tasted the quality of their fish you will understand why they are not giving it away through all you can eat specials.",

If you want recommendations from the sushi chef then this is a great choice. Service is quick, and fairly reasonably priced. The atmosphere is really cool. Definitely recommend for date night or going out with friends. Try the spicy tuna roll!",

Favorites are Salmon Tomato, Number 5, Rock n' Roll, & Superman Burrito.   Cool decor inside & friendly staff. Parking is tight due to Buffalo Wild Wings.

The food used to be really good, today it was terrible the lunch Roll combo served a salad of iceberg lettuce and a couple pieces of spinach and julienne carrot with a squeeze of dressing in the center of it coating one piece of lettuce and saturated with water. The tempura was greasy and miso soup was I don't know what, more like dish water! The spicy tuna roll was mushy and the sushi rice was not seasoned. When we moved to the North West we were so excited for this restaurant and frequented often today will be our last time!

    "text": "My sister, niece, and I visited this place around 1:30 to 2 and it was not busy at all. There was probably three or four tables occupied including us. The place was clean and spacious with many places to be seated. AYCE lunch price is $21.95 from open to 3PM and AYCE dinner price is $26.95 3PM to close (AS OF APRIL 7th, 2018). Half rolls are an option for their signature and specialty rolls.  --- We ordered the super white tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri, unagi, lemon salmon (half) roll, popcorn lobster (pictured), butter fly (half), Wonder Woman (half), wet dream, Japanese lasagna, baked lobster (pictured), Capt. America, hamachi kama, baked green mussels, edamame, and miso soup.  The top three rolls I recommend everybody to try is the Wonder Woman, Japanese lasagna, and Capt. America. The Wonder Woman roll had shitake mushrooms inside which tasted amazing. Japanese lasagna was perfectly baked and not overdone (pictured). The Capt. America had some spice to it but wasn't too spicy.  I recommend to avoid the wet dream. I've had this roll in other sushi locations and for the most part they follow the same track of tasting good. However, Umami's didn't. The roll tasted sour like they added too much lemon to it. We don't recall the roll having lemon but if it did, they definitely need to lessen the amount on the roll.  For dessert we ordered the coffee and strawberry mochi and an affogato. You are limited to only one dessert off the menu. The desserts we ordered tasted great!  --- The one con about this place is that service is a little slow in my opinion and the tables are weirdly sticky. When eating AYCE sushi, I want to order continuously trying multiple items from their menu. As for the tables, I don't know if the previous customer spilled a drink or something but the table was sticky and it felt gross eating on it. But despite all that, they kept our drinks filled to the rim and our hunger satisfied!",

Once we sat down, it was another 5-10 minute wait for a waiter, fine by this point I'm starving I just need food. So we ordered the all you can eat. Great. First roll came out in good time, we placed a second order at this time. 30 minutes later we still have not seen our second order.. I almost feel dumb for waiting that long before asking waiter, I figured they are on top of their tables. Needless to say, waiter had no idea what our second order was.. rude. We got our check paid for what we ate and left. All we did was waste our Friday night here, 2 1/2 hours most of it spent waiting. Shame. I will NEVER stray from sushi loca ever again. If you don't mind waiting, I guess their food is good!",

Business meeting, or you brought the kids. Ok fine.   So they put boxes and other miscellaneous storage here between the wall and the sushi bar. Kind of unsightly.  We sit in the waiting area and three guys come in and wait too. As we wait, the host comes and seats them before us. Yet we checked in first. OK no big deal. Maybe seating for three was available first than seating for two? Who knows. We wait for another twenty minutes, and I see empty tables.   Then a couple started to leave and on their way out they are compelled to warn us to not eat there.   They said that they waited over 30 minutes for their first order and it was wrong and when the correct food did arrive a chicken teriyaki that it was undercooked. No one wants undercooked chicken.   So we left. This is the second time we've tried Umami and been.... Sadly disapointed.",

It's a nice place to hang out, have a beer, and enjoy a few sushi rolls. On a recent visit I ordered the Hawaiian roll, the lemon salmon roll, and the \"burning your ass\" roll. Each roll tasted fresh and had its own distinctive flavor, but I definitely recommend the Hawaiian roll.   The wait staff is kind, knowledgeable, and they make great recommendations. Once they take your order, the food comes out within five minutes. My only complaint is once you make an order your waiter disappears for a little while, and it feels as if they've forgotten you, but their wait staff is so friendly and attentive when they're with you that it's not really a problem.",

I think our fav was the Chef #1. But there was so much more. Spicy tuna roll, Shrimp Lover roll, just all so good. Pieces: yellowtail, eel, tuna. Delish. It's our new favorite joint and we will be regulars.",

    "text": "Umami is an AYCE sushi located in North Las Vegas. If you are in this area, this place is so worth your time. I went to Umami after a long day of work. I was pleasantly surprised that they offer variety of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage for free with Yelp check in. I gave them their first star for this.   We were greeted right away by their wonderful staff. Our waiter was sweet and really helped us navigate through their endless options of nigiri, sushi rolls, and appetizers. The decor of the restaurant is really spot on. Light fixtures and little details on the wall really pleasant. The ambiance was great, with touches of Japanese arts.  We selected a huge order of nigiri from their menu.  They have a section in their menu for nigiri (one order per visit) that is a good deal. There were about 5 items on the menu that was in this category. My favorite out of the five  were uni and oysters.   Also, I was really blown away by the way they execute their nigiri portion. Because I have never had nigiri cut in thin really long slices before. The nigiris also came with very tiny pieces of rice (you get more fish for your order) which is AWESOME.   I would visit umami again. Next time I am bringing my whole family here for an evening of food and fun. Great service, great food, and most importantly, great price! AYCE $27",

If you want to have a nice outing with friends and family and are in the mood for more fish and less rice then you should definitely be at umami.",

    "text": "This is it!  After so many prayers, wishes, and animal sacrifices, we finally found a AYCE sushi spot by the house.  Located in the Office Depot plaza right off of the 215 on Durango N. the shorty and I stumbled on this gem while we were out on an adventure to demolish some yummy food.   Interior is a very nice mellow part sporty, part urban feel. Very clean might I say. Plenty of room with i think 3 large tables for those larger parties.  Always greeted and seated when we walk in, with as little as 0 Z-ro wait time. Not because they are bot busy, but because they are on top of turning over the tables.  Customer service is amazing. Fun, funny, knowledgeable, and patient staff. In fact, our first time here, the owner was nice enough to let us sample their dinner menu during lunch. On several occasions the chefs even had themed hats from The Golden Knights night, to a military themed night.  What was ordered:  Pang  Spicy Garlic Edamame  Power up - deep fried eel Shrimp tempura Bake green mussel 2 Salmon Kama Bacon and lobster skewer Bacon asparagus  Towering Sashimi  Sashimi Roll Miso  Tuna Salmon  Yellowtail Garlic salmon Albacore  Super white tuna Mackerel Strada lobster Tobiko Salmon belly  I'm sure I'm missing some stuff, but this is our usual take.  LET ME TELL YOU! They just may have the best rice to protein ratio down in Vegas. 10/90 is usually how we are served. Oh boy! And I love my protein. They have some of the tastiest takes on specialty dishes as well. I'll have to update to name some.   Point blank, definitely worth the try, trip, and that animal sacrifice we made.   We're happy!",

The only AYCE place I've been to that gives you such a large amount of fish in comparison to rice. The fish was very fresh tasting and service was really kind.    This will be my new sushi spot, even if they do not have a stamp program (which I'm not sure if they do or not) because you truly get your money's worth with the amount of fish they serve. Many places try to fill you up on rice but not this place. Restaurant was a nice size, not too cramped and service was fast as well.   Prices were comparable to other AYCE sushi restaurants which is nice.   Not a single bad critique based off my first experience and I will be having many more to come.",

Their service was lacking, sometimes when they get busy servers become ignorant, (dropping dish to tables and be gone, they don't take dirty dish out or take new order, not even looking at customers). And chefs are rolling with angry face lol. I guess that's because they are too busy and everyone is tired. But everything else is good.

I am absolutely thrilled that there is a quality sushi AYCE restaurant within driving distance from our home. When we got there the restaurant was packed and they told us the wait was going to be about 45 minutes. We've waited before during special occasions so it did not surprise me. We were actually seated earlier than 45 minutes. The wait is not my complaint. What did surprise me was that service was extremely slow. Ordering food and receiving our second and third orders took unusually long. I had to order a few things more than once because it was missed the first time around. The staff looked overwhelmed with the rush. I did notice that our usual servers weren't there. Even the owner of the restaurant had to come help take orders as best as he could. I really hope this was just a one time fluke and that this doesn't become another sushi loca. The three stars instead of 2 is because our experience isn't normally like this.",

Lobster Ramon is excellent, very spicy but so good. Sushi Rolls great as far as what we ordered. Oysters very small, too small for the price. Sushi, good but not so cold. Raw fish should be cold not room temperature. Staff was great the bus boys are awesome. (Hope the share in the tips because the really take good care of you).! Nice to have this on our side of town and will no doubt be back.",

My husband and I needed ginger and I asked the same person three or four times for ginger and she said that she was going to go and get it and instead went to go help other customers. The time that my husband and I went they were not that busy. So like I said the food was great but the customer service could have been a lot better.

Let's just say I consider this to be a \"provisional\" grade (or perhaps the better word for it is \"probationary\"). And the reason for this is the service. It is simply a disaster. Poorly organized, scatterbrained, and just plain misinformed. They repeatedly delivered the neighboring tables' dishes to us, and vice versa. So much so that it became an inside joke between us and the neighboring table. While amusing, It really showed a startling lack of finesse and training on the part of the staff. In a few cases staff were unable to identify a particular dish, yet insisted it was ours. I will return and at such time I will reevaluate this grade.  But for the moment it stands at three stars.",

Umami's food is much better as well. It's so nice to go to a sushi place where the tables aren't super packed together and the decor is well designed. The wall murals are fantastic and modern, rather than outdated Asian art that most places have.  Their rolls are well made, nigiri portions are much larger, and the selection of rolls is much better as well. Loved the New Washington roll, it was just one of many different rolls that I've never seen before elsewhere. This is absolutely our new place and we will be going back again soon!",

We ordered several of the limited to 1 time orders (nigiri salmon belly, oysters, screaming o) all the nigiri orders come with huge fish portion and very little rice, however the be warned the rolls are ginormous & come with heaping amounts of rice. We found out this was same owner as Sushi Neko in Chinatown which we frequent quite often and the rolls there have much less rice and smaller than here, other than that, the sushi quality was very good, food was served piping hot and tasted delicious. We ordered the udong noodles for our 3 yr old and it was just the perfect amount. We will definitely be back as we are locals, this location is much closer for us.",

Every roll had good flavor that was intense and bold when needed but also very light and refreshing on other rolls.  The only thing that I found strange was when I asked for a cup of coffee she brought me an iced latte. Or at least it seems like a nice latte. I like having a hot cup of coffee after every meal so getting something iced was unexpected.",

Some yummy AYCE sushi not far from where we live!  No need to trek across town for that raw fish!  The neighborhood seems to like it too, the Date Night wifey & I went was packed with patrons!  Was probably about a 15 minute wait before we got seated.  But once we got seated and greeted by our server, it was on like Donkey Kong!  After an initial 20 minute wait the food starting coming fast & furious!  We ate (and ate and ate):  -Pang -Hamachi Kama -Takoyaki -Burning your Ass -Screaming Orgasm Sashimi -BTS -Chanel -Popcorn Lobster -King of the Lobster -Something Wrong -Salmon Belly -Uni -Mini Miso Ramen -Spider Roll -Jackpot -Hawaiian  So much food in so little time!!  You got an 80 minute time limit, better make good use of it!  But wow - what great eating!  We had just a stack of food on our table...for 2 people!  Gotta say for us the food was on point!  Nice sizes of fish over rice, great ratio!  Good quality too!  Rolls were delicious, as well as the appetizers!  AND Umami does 1/2 rolls too, perfect for sampling a bunch from the menu!  Last time we were there, if you check in with Yelp you can get a small imported beer (I got a Sapporo) or a can of soda for FREE!  Get lit LOL!  Price was good too for a dinner meal - $26.95 a person!  Totally in the realm of great value!  Our service was excellent too, friendly, knowledgeable, & quick to please!  Overall a great meal!  We'll be back Umami!  Probably tonight because it's Date Night!",

The usually quick turn around was slow. And I felt like the rolls just weren't the same quality that I've come to expect at this place. Probably because of the rice...but even the cuts of fish were weird and messy.   This is my third visit. The first time was mediocre. Second was great. Third was meh.",

    "text": "I have to say, when we started our meal, I was pretty sure they were going to get a two star review.  The four of us all did the all-you-can-eat option. It took 45 minutes to an hour and we each had gotten only one item/order. We had a hard time getting a hold of our waiter, to see what was taking so long or try and get a highchair for my 10-month-old.   When we did get a hold of him, he was surprised that we haven't gotten our food yet. And upon talking to the sushi chefs realized they didn't make a lot of the food because they were out of tuna. So that solves my companions issues, but I don't eat raw fish and had ordered nothing with tuna and still didn't have my food either. We talked to the server morning and realized they had a very busy day and we're also understaffed. Despite the craziness, he was very nice and apologetic. And told us that he could give us the lunch price for all you can eat for our trouble as well as extra desserts.  Eventually the food started coming out more quickly and we found everything to be very delicious. They give great servings of fish and don't overdo the rice.  I was most impressed at the end of our meal by the manager. He thanked us for our patience, and asked what we loved and didn't. He explained that he is the new manager and is making changes to improve the restaurant. He gave us 50% off our entire meal and promised that he would do his best take care of us and give us a great experience at our next visit.   I was really impressed with his professionalism and openness. Despite the evening starting off somewhat challenging, I was very impressed with his management. We are looking forward to going back and watching the place grow and improve!  The only other suggestion I have is to add changing tables to the restrooms!",

    "text": "Umami is great if nigiri is your go-to selection at an AYCE sushi place.   I've been here four times and never had bad nigiri. I generally get salmon, tuna, yellowtail, red snappers, white tuna, and cajun albacore. The fish quality is always great and the size is huge as you can see in the photos. Unfortunately, Umami doesn't carry the big, white, creamy scallop. What you get is the chopped up scallop that is very chewy for some reason. The rice is good but short of amazing. I generally get a small bowl of sushi rice all by itself. To me, the rice could use a little more sugar and vinegar. Nevertheless, it was good enough to make the nigiri as a whole a satisfying indulgence.   I am not a fan of rolls in general and Umami doesn't do anything to change that for me. I've only tried their tiger roll and it was not the best I've had before.   The service here is great. The servers checked on us frequently to make sure we always have something to eat. Also, nigiri comes out so fast it's crazy. Absolutely no complaint here.   Overall, Umami is a fantastic place to get you nigiri fix...minus the scallop. :(",

It wasn't the best sushi place I've been to, but it was good and I'd return.   We went for lunch at 12:00 on a Thursday, only one other table of 2 inside. For rolls we got the popcorn lobster roll was amazing, not what I was expecting at all. The bam bam roll was okay, their screaming orgasm sauce I don't think is as good as other places.   Their baked mussels were not very cheesy but they were very hearty. Tried the shit, of course good. Bulgogi was alright. The cucumber crab salad was okay, it had way too much sauce.   Their nigiri list was pretty extensive, much larger than the place I usually go to. Their nigiri pieces of fish were massive, way bigger than any other place I've been to. It can be a little excessive, but for the price and quality I thought it tasted great.",

    "text": "When I think of all you can eat sushi, the first thing that comes to mind are trays of sushi that have been sitting for awhile and dried out, or plates and plates of sub-par sushi gliding by via conveyor belt...Umami is definitely NOT that.  You order off their EXTENSIVE menu and everything is fair game.  I hear this place gets packed on weekends so the three of us decided to visit during the week and for early dinner.  There were only a few diners when we got here but by the time we left at around 730, it was full.  My main focus was nigiri and wanted to try as many as I could.  They have over 30 types on their menu so it was hard to decide where to begin.  I'm allergic to shellfish so that did limit me on some, but that still gave me option of around 20.  I skipped some like the tamago and ikura and ordered double of some like the unagi and red snapper.  One thing to keep in mind is a few of the items you can only order once like the salmon belly and uni.  I did try one of the rolls as well, the Bam bam rool which was pretty good.  Some of other non sushi things we tried were the bulgogi appetizer and the hamachi collar, both were really good but the hamachi collar was exceptional.  All of the items were fresh and came out super fast but my favorites by far were the salmon belly, uni, and the unagi, these were really good.  And one thing about the nigiri...the cuts of fish were fairly large and the rice is on the smaller side making the piece of fish look even more huge, pretty impressive visually.   Their motto is \"Creating memories, one full belly at a time\" and I can assure you, I left full!  The AYCE price at dinner was $26.95 and I have no doubt for the amount and quality of food I had, it would've been  triple that amount at any other decent sushi place.  This is no-brainer come back to spot for me the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I stopped by today for a quick lunch because I haven't been here in months. I was sad to see that they no longer offer bento boxes but it looks like that is due to new management. They are also now all you can eat for all of you who love those kind of sushi places.   I didn't do all you can eat today because I never tend to be hungry enough. I ordered miso, a house salad and a lobster roll that I can't remember the exact name of but it had tempura shrimp and cooked lobster inside with salmon and avocado on the outside. The miso was actually super flavorful which is great because I've had a lot of very bland miso. The house salad was an extremely generous size for only being $1.50 and I enjoyed the dressing they used. The only problem was that they absolutely drenched the salad in dressing so it was a bit soggy towards the end and I didn't finish all of it.   The roll is listed on the menu saying it is an 8 piece but when I got mine it was only 5. I asked the waitress and she told me it is only supposed to be 5 but due to the misprint she quickly got me 3 additional pieces. Honestly I was full after 5 so I can see why they don't normally do the full 8 pieces. The roll was really good and they give a sauce with it that compliments it well. Only complaints would be that the seaweed wrapped around the roll doesn't come apart easily so unless you stuff the whole piece of roll in your mouth it is kind of a struggle to eat.   The servers were really attentive. They checked on me repeatedly but not too much to where it became annoying. My drink was never empty and as soon as I finished something they cleared it away for me. I will definitely have to try out the all you can eat one day when I'm more hungry.",

    "text": "Umami is our go to spot for sushi. We come here almost every weekend but have also tried many other sushi spots in town. Being from Hawaii, we are pretty picky when it comes to sushi and fish. Although the fish at Umami may not be as fresh as we're used to back home, they still make awesome nigiri and their fish is rarely fishy. We usually always stick to the nigiri as my wife and I love fish. Let me tell you, their fish to rice ratio is da best!!! They always give a huge piece of fish and a small amount of rice!   A big downfall is their service, it's always a hit or miss every time we dine here. Sometimes the service is fast and on point, while other times you may be forgotten and need to continuously flag down servers to either take your next order or refill your waters. I will say though we've had more positive experiences than bad ones. I want to give a huge shoutout to Cezar, because every time he has been our server he's always been very friendly and provided excellent service!   Overall, despite the inconsistent service this is a great sushi spot especially for nigiri!",

We noticed the menu was different and I believe even the interior was changed. We walked in very nervous due to having such a bad experience last time.   First off the the nigiri was absolutely phenomenal, it was like eating at sushi neko or sakana all over again. I love nigiri and everything that we tried was amazing! The appetizers we were delighted with it all. My favorite has to be the fried rice. Just be prepared because it is a lot of rice they give you in the fried rice! The beef in the fried rice even tastes quality. Where I was really nervous was my Vegas roll. The yum yum sauce was anything but before. It tasted like sour mayo. When I got it i was shocked it was absolutely delicious! Even the yum yum sauce was good.  Overall I'm glad everything was up to par with the other sister properties because this is our new favorite place in vegas to get sushi. Keep it going guys!",

I have eaten sushi all over the country, and this is definitely one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants at which I have ever dined. The fish is fresh, the variety is impressive, and the service has been truly excellent. (One server  I will call her \"B\", is not good. We will make sure that we do not sit in her section ever again, but everyone else has been really, really good.)  I am often disappointed in the quality of the sushi at the AYCE places. This is an exception. Yum! And it is very reasonably priced- I think that dinner is $27 or $28 a person for dinner.",

The best sushi to get is hands down the salmon belly, extremely fatty and rich, like butter.  The other sushi is pretty much standard, uni, ahi, and salmon sushi are all up to par.  The sushi is expertly cut, very clean and thin.  Service is quick and friendly with consistent checks on your table for more orders.  The only negative thing I have to say is the rice is a bit hard.. but since they don't give as much, doesn't quite matter as much.  Recommended even when you have to drive a bit farther from the Strip.",

    "text": "I originally was suppose to go to Yama Sushi for lunch today but plans changed and I ended up going to Umami with my mom.  I told her that this place was recommended on this side of town and since it's so close to our house, we might as well give it a go so we don't have to troop down to Chinatown for AYCE sushi.   We got there right before noon and there was only 2 other tables.  We got the female server and she just didn't seem like she wanted to be at work.  She walked around like she regretted not calling out from work today.  With that being said, service was not good.  It took a long time after our appetizers to arrive and for the server to come back to our table to take our entree orders.  We did AYCE so we didn't want to rush but we also didn't want to wait forever to be able to order.  The server also forgot some items we wanted and even my hot tea.  The bus boy was on it, running food and refilling water cups.  More staff clocked as we were finishing up our meal and they helped us with dessert and our check.  The manager was running around but he didn't engage with any of the tables.    We were able to get the last 2 hamachi kamas so we were happy about that.  The power up appetizer  was surprisedly good.  It was pieces of deep fried eel.  It was super tender and very flavorful.  I could eat that all day!  The takoyaki was disappointing.  It was undercooked and doughy.    My mom was really impressed with the sushi bcs they gave hardly any rice and the pieces of fish were huge.  The salmon was a bit off bcs the last piece I had was super fishy and left a bad aftertaste.    We tried to order the poke salad but was told that it was only for dinner although it was not marked.  The server also didn't even try to upsell us to the dinner menu either.    For dessert, my mom had the affagato and they do it just like Hwaro where they put corn flakes on top for texture.  My mom likes that.  I got the red bean ice cream and for some reason it was sour!  It was so weird.  It was like they used bad milk to make the ice cream.  I don't know if they made it themselves or brought it from a third company but it was horrible!    Also the tables were sticky.  Not like there's something on it right now sticky, but the they've wiped but really needs to get bleached kind of sticky.  It was kinda gross.  I used the plastic menu as a table mat.    There were big screen TVs playing college basketball all the while playing k pop.    I'm not very fond of the place... especially with service.  Not sure if I'll be back.",

The specialty roles are well worth the price, as the fish is always fresh.  The garlic edamame was very good..it had some kick.  I've had both the cucumber salad and house salad both great for inexpensive price.   They offer a wide selection of food choices, including sushi, regular dinner choices, teriyaki choices, ramen dishes.  The prices range from low to high depending on the dish.   This is not a fast food restaurant,  this is better dining. They have a few \"BIG\" booths for larger parties, which is nice if a lot of people share sushi dishes.    I recommend this restaurant, the service and food is consistently great. My husband has degrees in culinary arts (chef), he's pretty picky.  He applauds this restaurant.  Do try some of the more expensive sushi specialty dishes,  they are worth the money.",

Really can't beat the ramen combo that comes with a salad and a roll for $12. The rolls were good, according to my son and husband. They had the miso and shoyu ramen and said they were just ok, we've had much better in town. My major disappointment was that they don't have any vegetarian or poultry based ramen, it's all pork belly. So the other kids and I had the teriyaki chicken and cucumber rolls. Teriyaki was ok, cucumber rolls were good. The service was very friendly. Based on the food alone, I would have probably given it 3 stars but bumped it to 4, hoping people check them out for themselves.",

The smallest pieces of fish and not the best cut! Like no marbling at all. So we say like other places out here don't have good sushi. So we order a few rolls.  They were ok but for the price it's not worth it! $83 for two people and were at Arby's now filling up! Epic fail!!",

The Sushi was okay but I would go to another sushi place to get sushi. I tried other things and they always add more than you ask for. So I literally only ordered PLAIN fried rice because everything else i had to send back. Just 2 of the waitresses  had no emotion and was a bit rude, they walked by and I smilead and they looked at me and walked away and didn't even smile back. They were the only ladies working on Sunday 3/11/18 at 9:00. please have a talk. Things to focus on...  * More emotion to customers at least a smile * Stop going over board if someone orders white rice don't add a bunch of sauce. *Better service.  * Chill out on the sauce to stiff!",

As well,  you don't feel rushed to order here,  as I usually do in the other sushi restaurants nearby. The selection for sushi isn't as tremendous as you'd find,  but this place didn't offer AYCE either, which I like,  cuz I don't feel like I need to eat 4 huge servings to make it worth it.   Nonetheless, the sushi was fresh, plated nicely and tasty.  My -1/2 comes only because the Japanese Lasagna came with aLOT of mayo sauce not in the description and tonight no Strawberry Champagne Cake everyone else is raving about.  Had the Affogato and that was good vanilla ice cream with coffee poured on top.   Tasty.  Definitely coming back!! (Table next to us ordered the ramen and that looked sooooooo good!!!)",

FLAVORLESS and poor quality fish, all made ahead. We were so sad. None of the old Ramen dishes are there or original \"designer\" rolls that made them stand out. Original staff gone! The gem we had found now blends in with the rest. Back to Yummy Sushi on Cheyenne and Tenaya we go. At least the fish was fresh. It was just a long drive. Please please Umami, go back to the way it was! You were the best! Were being the key word. Last night was awful!",

It used to be such good quality and service that we wouldn't bat an eye about paying at least a $100 for 2 people. So we figured we would give it a chance but were hesitant because of the \"all you can eat\" option, which is never a good sign. Now we're still paying the price 3 hours later. well the search for a new sushi restaurant begins. Such a bummer!",

Extremely disappointing service tonight. I felt like our waitress forgot about us. I only had one glass of water it sat empty for most of our dinner. My husband ordered all you can eat sushi and it took so long for him to get his rolls he could only eat 4. Which just nearly made the all you can eat price worth it. The other waitress who filled my husbands iced green tea was rude no eye contact and acted like we were an inconvenience to her time. Finally when it was time to leave i asked 3 different people for our check before i actually received it and then our original waitress who we saw maybe twice since we sat down came back asking if we wanted desert. All in all for an anniversary dinner we could have go to a sushi restaurant we love and always get great service at. Won't be coming back.",

I had a roll with no rice. It was wrapped in cucumber.   It would have been fine if it was wrapped once, but the cucumber was wrapped twice and was so thick, the roll lost all of its flavor.  We also ordered the vegetable tempura.  They barely gave us any dipping sauce to go with it.  I asked for another side of it from the busser.  How can I dip the veggies in a 1/4\" of sauce?  Definitely never going back here.  Trying to find a new sushi spot in the NW but this is not going to be it.",

The decor is fabulous, the service is exceptional, the presentation is amazing and the Sushi is heavenly!     If you like baked rolls you will quickly discover that every baked roll you have ever had in your past was wrong and these baked rolls are just right right right.  If you like Japanese Lasagna order the Vegas roll instead... this is a detour in the right direction!  The Full Moon proves that not every roll has to be heavy to have incredible flavor.

    "text": "We have been going to Sen of Japan for quite some time and thought we had found the best sushi in town... and then we decided to give Umami a try based on Yelp reviews. Not only were we NOT disappointed, but this is, by far, THE BEST SUSHI we've ever had. And not just in Las Vegas, but anywhere! The sushi is so fresh that it practically melts in your mouth. The pieces were so big and thick. The spicy salmon roll was not typical at all. The pieces of salmon were diced, almost like a Poke. And the Carson roll! Soft shell crab, scallop, tuna, avocado and cucumber with a giant piece of salmon on top. A must have! We went on Wednesday and going again tonight, 2 days later. Our server, Nina, was sweet and extremely efficient.   And did I mention the price?? So reasonable it's crazy. If you love sushi, you owe it to yourself to try Umami. But wait, never mind, don't! I don't want to have to fight the crowds",

Will be back to try other plates.  Lighting is an issue if you're a senior citizen (like me) as you cannot read the menu unless you make sure you're seated under direct lighting.  Yes, it is on the dimmer side because of the big screen TVs and the projector.  Pricing is typical of suburban Vegas as I've experienced for the last week as a new resident from LA.  Plenty of parking and among other fine dining in this northwest area.  Looks like this area is the new place to frequent and I can see why.",

Selection of sushi and their Champaign cake was fantastic.  Under new management and things are the same.  Seems as if they are focusing on all you can eat and the roles mainly focus on spicy tuna and cream cheese.  Our server was horrible! So fast, like she was busy with other tables and didn't want to wait while we glanced for a sec at the menu, before she walked away. Clearing our dishes before we are even done. Sorry to say, if it's not broken, DONT FIX IT.   Missing the cake btw. Boo to new management and taking so many good rolls away.   First timers and all I can say is great local sushi place. Their atmosphere is so modern, love the open feel and cleanliness.   Small inside so make sure you come early but we had zero problem getting in.   Our server was Stephanie (very polite and attentive) much appreciated.   Music is very upbeat and they have three Tv's.   Everyone is just so friendly! All the food we had I have zero complaints. Made fresh. NOT fishy and made perfect compared to other sushi places near by.  Thanks again for a great first impression.",

One was for AYCE sushi stuff and a smaller one with a few bento box combos, ramens, and udons. Nothing looked really good so I played it safe with a shrimp tempura udon. The order came out with tons of rough chopped and chunked green onions when I asked for none. After I painstaking took them out, there were 2 sad tempura shrimp, 1 slice of fish cake, and a piece of fried tofu cut in half. The broth was typical udon you get from mixing water and the udon concentrate. The udon was cooked okay but had a lot of broken pieces like on the bottom of a package. There wasn't a lot of udon either. I'm rarely on this side of town and I'm rarely eating alone but I had a few hours to kill and wanted to try this place because it was newer and I used to live on this side of town when there weren't a lot of restaurants. My server clearly saw me picking out all the green onions and she even repeated no green onions when I ordered, but she never said a word after. I paid my $11 plus tip and I'll be trying a different place next time.",

Salmon was top shelf. Avocado was bright green and very fresh and crisp. 4. Shrimp ebi sushi. Largest shrimp I've ever gotten at a sushi bar. Again fresh and delicious. 5. Amberjack sushi. Nice flavor with a truffle sauce. Wasabi buried under the fish. Yum. 6. Yellowtail and salmon salad that was free compliments of the chef. Had a tangy mayo tossed in with roi on top. Was very good. 7. Spicy tuna roll. Perfectly flavored and had the nice red color to it.  We will come again.",

Not your typical strip mall restaurant - we had top notch food  with amazing service in a fabulous space.  There were great lunch options:  my husband and I had the sashimi bowl - super fresh, generous cuts with gorgeous presentation (see pic).  Loved the addition of pickled veggies which gave a satisfying crunch alternative to the fish and co trading briny flavor.  One son had Unagi Don Bowl - big portion of rice & eel which he said was the best dish he's ever had!  The other boy had a mixture of rolls -- all fantastic.    Wish we were staying closer, would have gone bsbk for dinner!",

The servers were super nice, and David and Marcelo made my experience amazing. The servers are nice to talk to and they know what the menu consists of, even though they have a ton of menu items to choose from. I enjoyed Marcelo's presence especially, he would crack jokes from time to time and make our ordering experience special. As the food came out, it was fresh and you could tell that it was made carefully from the hands of a sushi chef. If you're looking for a good roll, I would suggest the Lemon Salmon Roll or the Salmon-holic!! I'm addicted to salmon so those were my go-to's throughout the meal. If you wanted to choose a sushi spot that's not too busy and want a super enjoyable experience, go to Umami!! Also ask for Marcelo as your server for the best experience.",

    "text": "My experience at Umami. Well there was so many things that went wrong. The biggest issues were not getting the food we ordered and had to ask over 4 times where the food was. The waiter even though he was kind couldn't remember he had already asked me many times if I needed anything else after delivering our new orders that our original orders never showed up. We were there for over and hr and our food and appetizers didn't come till the end. They also gave our waters to the table next to us. The table next to us got someone else's food. Idk if it was a fluke of the evening or what but with a son who's special needs who gets hangry this wasn't the place or experience for us. They offered us desserts but after not getting my sons food or drinks till the end of our meal I didn't want to chance waiting any longer. We had stayed way longer than what we wanted but only because they couldn't deliver the food. By the time they got around to delivering it the meats were burnt and the soy beans weren't even the correct ones. The staff is friendly and the place is clean but that's all I can say about that. Also I was told I was given drinks for free for the inconvenience but was still charged for a drink. I know it's petty but after waiting forever for food and then being told no charge for drinks only for that to be wrong as well is too much for me and won't return or recommend. Two stars because they were friendly and clean.",

One of the things that disappointed me was when I asked for salmon skin temaki I was given a cut roll and was told that is how temaki is made.  Since I have been eating sushi for about 30 years, I know that temaki is a hand roll.  I usually ask for Saba shiso temaki but I didn't in this instance.  And I also got unagi sushi with some kind of sweet sauce on it, another first for me, and I didn't particularly enjoy it with the sauce.  My friend who has little experience with sushi was satisfied with her food, which is why I said it was geared to American tastes, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  I just prefer a more traditional Japanese sushi.",

Went in and was immediately greeted by the host with a welcoming \"Iirashaimase\" which means welcome in Japanese. Our server was Marcelo and he grabbed all our orders promptly. When the sushi came out, I was really surprised because the rice and fish ratio was surprisingly good! Lots of fish and little rice? Thank you! All the Nigiris were fantastic but I would really recommend the Smoked Paprika Salmon nigiri! This nigiri is super flavorful! And of course Marcelo came back and always checked on our group, which is a huge plus to me because I understand AYCE sushi joints can get a bit busy. I really enjoyed their dessert selection also. My group ordered the Mini Honey Toast but I got the Tempura Ice Cream. Both desserts were amazing! This place is a must!",

Sushi on the northwest part of town is decent and found myself in the mood for something close by. The decor and set up gives the restaurant a chill and open vibe with flowers and homey touches; perfect for the weather warming up!  Our server was hilarious and honestly made the whole experience much more than I anticipated. His name was Marcello (my bad on spelling) and he was attentive, made good recommendations (yes get the KFC and salmon nigiri.. just do it), and he had such a laid back personality. We're all probably here for the food, so let's get to it.  I love the AYCE option and they offer half rolls on most rolls. Definitely get anything with the s.o. sauce (yep just get it). Some standouts for me was the tuna and salmon; so delicious with thick slices, and I loved the Chanel roll.. Sweet yet spicy, and just plain ol' delicious.   If you find yourself on this side of town, roll in for lunch or dinner. High five if you caught the sushi roll reference.",

It was covered in really sweet yum sauce.   And really? Some of the worst service we've ever had in Las Vegas. Our waitress never checked up on us. She kept walking by with nothing. Never gave us water and gave us one glass for our two beers. She said they ran out. We had to ask her 30 minutes later to bring one. After an hour of not being served, we saw her walk out with her purse. Nice.   Other guys kind of checked up on us. Still took forever to get anything. Had to ask for the check twice.  Yes, it was busy. To busy for them not to be able to serve? No. I watched everyone else that came in the time we did leave 20-30 mins before us.  The most ridiculous part was listening to the waiters constantly get onto the sushi chefs. Eye rolling, yelling, rudeness. It was quite uncomfortable.   Man, sucks. This place was good. Now, it sucks butt.",

Our rolls were not good and very fishy, and the next day we are paying for that. We had to remind the host about our water and food we never got. I will not be going again. The cheap rolls reflect the fishy taste and lack of service.",

    "text": "This is one of our go-to spots for AYCE sushi! It's at a good location (off of 215 & N. Durango), their fish is definitely fresh, they have a wide variety on their menu, & the price is just right. Their dining area is a good size, clean atmosphere, and (of course) a sushi bar if you prefer that dining experience. If you've been to Sakana or Sushi Neko, you'd notice that their menus are very similar to each other. I believe they're owned by the same owner/family? Please correct me if I'm wrong.   Like I said, they have a lot of items on their menu! Last time we visited here, we ordered edamame, The Shit, Power Up, Baked Green Mussels, Hamachi Kama, Nigiri (salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail [my fave nigiri], super white tuna, and mackerel), all of the bacon & _____ skewers, & their sushi rolls (Lobster Special, Wet Dream, Lasagna, Baked Lobster, Lemon Salmon, Captain America, & Wonder Woman). My person favorites are the Lemon Salmon rolls (because I love the combination of lemon + salmon), Hamachi Kama, & their nigiris. They have an amazing fish-to-rice ratio, but sometimes it tends to fall apart so I end up eating with my hands instead. Traditionally, that's how it should be anyway.   As far as service goes, they're pretty great when it comes to ordering your food, getting the dirty plates off of your table, and refilling your water. Out of the x amount of times I've been here, I've only had one day where I had bad service. Lately, it's been great!   Big heads up: I don't know if it's just me, but their tables feel sticky sometimes. It's not too big of deal, but it could be an issue to some.  TLDR; Bomb sushi place up in Centennial Hills with great service, great fish-to-rice ratio on nigiri, & similar to Sushi Neko + Sakana.",

However, I do like how they have redone the place, but am very disappointed that they no longer have seats at the sushi bar. The reason I go to a sushi bar is to sit at the sushi bar & be up close with my sushi chefs & watch what they do & serve me. I really hope that they bring back seats at the sushi bar for those that really like the experience of sitting at the SUSHI BAR!!  Please Bring Seats Back Soon!!!  Thank you from a loyal   I went back again last Thursday & was still not happy to see that the chairs were still not at the sushi bar. Also, every since I have had to sit at the tables the quality seems to have gone down. I'm also wondering why both TV's are playing these strange Japanese type videos. Either have a sports game on in the background or maybe play American music that we can understand.  Think it's time to find another place with my friends since things have changed so much.  I will need to see if the chairs come back at the sushi bar, quality gets better & music changes.",

A Maki Nigiri piece will be a mouthful so prepare yourself of some serious chew and fat cheeks. If you order a roll then your meal is done. You're full! Also, All other AYCE on oysters at least gives you 2 pcs limited to one order. Here, one. Not worth the premium $26.95 + tax-tip for a rice dinner. There's far better places to go in Vegas. Tried it twice. Not going for a 3rd. Absolutely hate it when places do this with the rice. C'mon guys!  I'm one of those folks that love and know sushi. Good and bad.

First off, the music is supppper loud. Communicating is difficult without trying to talk over the music. At some point the quality went down and it was just an unpleasant older radio sound but far too loud for my comfort..however, maybe thats just me.   As for the food, I highly advise sticking mostly with their nigiri.  The fish to rice ratio is actually awesome and reasonable. But once you start getting to the rolls...holy moly..talk about a mayonnaise overload. Everything is so drenched in mayo that deciphering tastes is near impossible. And you wouldn't even know they were going to have mayo on them by the menu, because nothing says that. It was an unpleasant surprise to say the least. The salmon skin handroll was chewy and not quite what I expect but still ok nonetheless.   All in all, I probably wont be coming back. I cant handle the intense mayo tastes, strict time limits, and lack of kids options.",

Just to wrap it up I order a roll and it came I once we were literally paying the bill, it took an hour from yhe time i ordered it. Oh the garlic tuna (nigiri) had good flavor. Lol.

Right after we sat down a bunch of people came in so we knew it was very popular. Our server took our order fairly quickly and I gotta say WOW the food came to our table very quickly as well. The best part was the actual sushi.. they were SO good. I have told so many people about this place after I had it and am planning to go back again next week! Definitely a must try!!",

    "text": "Update November 25, 2017. Umami has new ownership and had turned into the typical AYCE sushi place. I've been and was unimpressed with the new service or quality of food. Stay away.  If you're honest with yourself you know there hasn't been any really good sushi in Centennial. When I need sushi I've been willing to drive 20 minutes away for a decent restaurant.   I think Umami may have changed that. My husband and I went recently on a weekday night and sat at the sushi bar. Freshness and flavor were comparable to the better places in Chinatown or on the strip. They had special selections of fish that were not on the menu but offered to us. And this is really important - the sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about different types of fish and flavor. We really like this place and will return!  Things I'd like to see- wi-Fi. If you had Wi-Fi I'd probably eat there every day. I can't come for lunch and be completely detached from work. I'd also like to see options like chirashi or donburi. Not sure if I'm able to order this off the menu--if available, please let me know!",

The most important thing to me is the freshness of the fish and I thought everything was good!!  I love when places like this one offer 1/2 rolls as part of AYCE.   All the nigiri and rolls hit the spot. I loved the garlic tuna and salmon the best. Along with burning my ass roll, No.1 chef master roll, and the KFC/gyoza apps I'll be back!!!!",

She also checked up on us often to ask if we wanted to order more. All the food that came out was delicious and one of the better sushi restaurants i've tried.

The teriyaki beef was rather tough and overly smothered with sauce. Also disappointing.   Might be worth another visit to try the AYCE sushi, whose menu is enormous.",

    "text": "Warning: new owners, new menu. Don't come here if you are looking to experience the original ala carte menu.  Uuuuughhhhh wish I wasn't writing this review. I used to come here often when it was owned by the original owners and this place was amazing. They had an ala carte menu but honestly it was worth paying the price because the quality/presentation was soooo worth it.  Now that Umami has been bought out by the owners of Sakana (boooooo) they have completely changed the menu and are now an all you can eat sushi joint. So if you are looking for quality look else where, this place is all about quantity now.  First off, I haven't been a fan of Sakana. I hate the way they portion their nigiri with 90% fish and 10% rice. I was almost positive it was going to be the same at this newly managed Umami so I started off with a small order.   -beef bowl -chicken bowl -seared salmon with lemon nigiri -Japanese lasagna roll -#1 roll chef makes  Umami originally had a beef bowl (gyuudon) so we were under the impression it was going to be the same delicious bowl, but when it came out we got a teriyaki beef bowl. The meat was SO chewy my mouth was getting tired after eating one piece. We ended up asking the server if we could switch it out for a chicken bowl because it was so hard to eat. They accommodated us and got rid of the beef bowl. The taste of the seared salmon with lemon was good, but I was right about the portions and couldn't eat the whole piece of nigiri. The lasagna roll was decent and so was the #1. Nothing special.   The server we had was good and he was definitely handling a lot of tables as best as he could. When I got my bill he had still charged us for the beef bowl instead of the chicken, but he was so busy I didn't care to get it taken care of. It was a $1 difference. They gave me a 10% discount for showing my military ID.  I was definitely upset the whole dinner because I wasn't expecting the food to be that bad... but it was lol. I won't be coming back since I am not a fan of Sakana or Sushi Neko.",

However, Umami fits the bill in so many ways that I have to give it 5 stars.  I only hope that the quality stays high.  We are regulars and we have tried so many things already on the menu.  The things my wife and I love:  - Sushi & Sashimi Platter - Beautiful design, high quality fish, assortment of pickled sides. - Shoyu Raman - Pork broth is slow cooked all day and isn't super cloudy. - Short Ribs - Flavorful but not just slathered with sauce.  Beautiful marinade. - Taco Wasabi - Raw Octopus with Wasabi sauce, its an acquired taste but they do it well! - Tempura - Nice and Crispy! - Number 5 Roll - Albacore Tuna, Spicy Tuna, and the best part fried onion rings! - Strawberry Champagne Cake - Delicate and savory - Tempura Ice Cream - Duh, it's just awesome!  The service is top notch.  They've only been open for 2 weeks and I've already spoken to Chef Jun and the Restaurant Manager several times.  They care about what you think and communicate with you because they want to know what they did well and how they can improve.  The wait staff is friendly but you can tell this is a little new to all of them.  Nevertheless, I always felt attended to.  The establishment is a reflection of a more high-end sushi bar that might be near the strip.  On the far wall from the entrance is a huge painted mural of samurai.  If you're a sports fan they also have large screens playing all the games.  One of my favorite parts this the music they play.  They have a mix of downtempo and upbeat instrumental hip hop.    If you are in the area or live near I definitely recommend coming here.  I'm so happy to have a Japanese restaurant that has both sushi and ramen.",

We thought we found out \"Ramen Noodle\" favorite spot and little to our imagination... we ended up going back a month later & the place was completely renovated and they didn't have their Ramen Noodle menu anymore. It's now an AYCE sushi restaurant. The sushi was pretty good, although the wait we had was an 1.20 hours!! So many people were going ahead of us because we had a party of 5 adults +2 toddlers. The guy kept updating us with a 20 min wait and it was 5x that!! He did offer us drinks on the restaurant which was nice, I just didn't like that we had to wait so long when they could've combined 2 other tables and gave us a high chair for our 2 toddlers. ",

    "text": "We had been loyal patrons of this restaurant until recently.  They've changed management and now are just like every other bland \"all you can eat\" place.  One of the things that we loved about the prior menu was that they used quality ingredients, offered high end sashimi and other non-roll type food.  For this reason, we were there at least once a week and spent well over $100 each visit.  Tonight we sadly left and won't be back.  In addition to their new menu problems, any business that decides it's ok to fire all of their chefs and waitstaff with NO NOTICE is not one that I want to spend my money at.  The only thing better than their food was their previous staff.  We truly enjoyed that we could walk in, be seated, and the wait staff knew what we wanted to drink and the chefs knew what appetizers we wanted to start with.  Firing all of these talented people was a huge business blunder.  Sorry Umami, you've lost extremely loyal customers who are very vocal.  Instead of sending new people your way, we are informing all of our friends about everything we saw and warning them about all the steps down in quality.",

Plastic menus and paper napkins.      The salmon, tuna and shrimp sushi I tried were OK, but my etemami did not seem fresh. It is not bad as all you can eat places go. If that is what you want. I am looking for higher end up here in the NW area. I liked not having to go all the way down to the strip. Miss the old sushi chefs and my fav sushi dishes. SO BUMMED!",

We were seated almost immediately and the waitress went over the drinks and made some recommendations. The menu is simple and not overwhelming. They have your topical rolls and Nigiri with a nice number of restaurant specific rolls.   We went with a nice mix of rolls and nigiri. The food came out in a timely manner spread out few rolls at a time. ( I have been to some restaurants where they dump your whole order at once and it's overwhelming).  The presentation of the food was nice . The food was delicious , everything was fresh and great portions of fish , no ingredient was overwhelming.  I highly recommend the Vegas roll and the Sammon nigiri.   The cost for a NOT ALL YOU CAN EAT restaurant was fair , not to expensive and good value. I think our bill for 2 people with beer and about 4 rolls and 2 nigiri was around $65.   My 2 down sides ( still not worth dropping to a 4 star, they bugged me but the wife thought I was being crazy ). The front door has a bell on it when it opens , it drove me crazy lol.  Second,  soda you get a can , I just hate it it's $2 for a soda and you bring me a can ,  makes me feel like wtf I just paid $2 for a can ahahaha. ( the food still over powers this complaint )",

About three days ago I was craving sushi so decided to stop by and was surprised by the new management sign outside. Still decided to go in hoping the menu, quality  and attention to detail was still the same. But nope the menu is completely different and worst of all they converted the restaurant to an all you can eat place. After glancing at the menu for about 15 minutes because nothing stood out and also service was terrible. We just decided to walk out and eat elsewhere.  Extremely disappointed that I lost my favorite local sushi place. PS also all my pictures from this place are from the previous management.",

All three of the rolls we ordered were placed on a plate with a dollop of sauce - nothing fancy to see here folks.   I agree with one review here about the fish being cut too thick. The fish should be cut delicately thin, if you want to be authentic.   The ambience could be so much better without the tvs. If I want to catch the game I can walk down to Buffalo Wild Wings! They're so out of place!!! Get rid of the tvs, paint some Japanese anime in their place and you have appropriate ambience.   Finally, the service was slow even though the place was almost empty when we came here. We had to ask for ginger and wasabi, too.",

We were greeted promptly by one of the waitstaff.  We opted to sit at the sushi bar.  We ordered tako wasabi and screaming O appetizers.  The tako wasabi was a very good sized portion of blissful fresh octopus marinated in wasabi and a little chilli.  Very tasty.  The screaming O didn't get made until we had a couple other rolls.  While the tuna was fresh and tasty, the sauce was like watery soup.    We also had a Carson roll, a No Name roll, Number 5 roll and a Red Bull.  All the rolls were very nicely made and generally very tasty except for the No Name Roll.  That particular roll was so mild tasting I really did not know what I was eating.  Also the No Name is made like Futumaki, five large pieces.  Service was top notch.  Everyone checked on us numerous times and the chef was friendly and fast.  Would definitely go back.  We decided next time to try the ramen.",
