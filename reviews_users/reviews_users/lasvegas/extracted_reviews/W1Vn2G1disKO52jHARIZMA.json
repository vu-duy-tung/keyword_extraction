    "text": "The food at this place was good. The reason I'm giving the 5 stars is for the service. When we walked in the host was very friendly. Our server, Kevin was absolutely amazing. He was so friendly, attentive, and just on it. I have to say this guy would be a great server in a 5 star restaurant, he was so pleasant. It is so hard to find such a great server these days. I am so impressed, because rarely do I get this great of service. Thank you Kevin, I will definitely be back and request Kevin.  We had another amazing dinner at CPK in Town Square. The food was good, but once again our service was great. Jasx or Jasmine she said she goes by either name was on point, super friendly, and just on it when it came to service. She will make your dinner more enjoyable, because she is so nice. Thank you.",

    "text": "This is the place for a variety of pizza plus choices of salads, soups, appetizers, drinks, and dessert all while in a very family friendly environment. I feel this place is big enough to serve large families, but there are also more secluded places for a quiet meal.  There is the bar where all the action happens- tv and the oven can be your entertainment. Yes, CPK is a chain, but a great place at TS to stop in and know your children in the stroller are welcome and also it won't break the bank.  Service has always been eager and friendly to help you have a positive dining experience.  Don't forget they have to to go option as well.  I have yet to eat out on the patio,but that may be the place for a more quiet meal.  They do have some lighter menu items for the health conscious which is always good.  Food has been consistent the handful of times that I have eaten here. It tastes how the menu describes it and how the picture looks.  So next time you are hungry after shopping or need to kill some time before the movie- stop by CPK.",

    "text": "After some exhaustive shopping, Mom, sister and I decided CPK sounded good and with the weather in Vegas being so fabulous (it's that 2 week window between being hot as an over and cold as a freezer), we decided we'd dine al fresco.  We were immediately seated and our wonderful server (who's name I regrettably didn't get) immediately took our drink and dinner order.  We started with a large Caesar salad to share and it was, well...ok. It wasn't like the CPK Caesar I remember. It just seemed lacking-the dressing was almost non-existent on parts of it. The croutons and Parmesan cheese were, however, delicious. On to the star of the show...the pizza. My mom and I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza. Onions, garlic, chicken, cheese...need I say more? I'm quite certain that our breath was kickin' afterward but it was worth it. So good. So, so, so good! My sister ordered the club pizza and she liked it but it wasn't that great as a leftover-mainly due to the avocados on it.  The service was top notch, the pizza was on point and all in all, you just can't go wrong with CPK!",

So, I didn't feel as guilty indulging in a carb fest, knowing that we were giving back to our community.   PIZZAS The Original BBQ Chicken (original hand tossed): I'm confident that I can eat this single-handedly. BBQ chicken + GOUDA CHEESE on pizza as a perfect combo and completely threw me off. It has just the right amount of sweet and savory flavors.  Wild Mushroom (original hand tossed): I love mushrooms on my pizza, but this was practically bland. We didn't order the white truffle oil, which might've added that missing flavor factor. I'm not saying the pizza wasn't good, but it didn't stand out among the others.   Margherita (thin crust): Simple and delicious. I loved the cheesy, stringy Mozzarella, but I wasn't a fan of the crust. Despite that, the pie was a hit.   DESSERT Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake: Warm, rich and fudgy, and it's served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!   SERVICE Great. Make reservations ahead of time. The place was busy during lunch, but our server and her team went above and beyond with taking care of my table's needs. Shout out to Jesse, the GM, who also did an awesome job ensuring that we were enjoying our experience.  OVERALL I may have to return in the future to try some of their more interesting pizza creations.",

I hadn't been to CPK in forever and the only location I've ever been to is the one at Fashion Show. We arrived at 3:30 and surprisingly the place was full and there was a 15 minute wait.    This place reminded me of Chuckie Cheese with all the kids everywhere. LOL I much prefer the atmosphere at the Fashion Show location. Everything here just seemed kind of cheap even the napkins... & I swear I remember the food tasting much better.  -Mango Sangria: Reminded me of Mexican candy which I happen to like haha but there were only 3 pieces of fruit in there and I couldn't even taste any wine/alcohol..  -Grilled Peaches & Shrimp Salad: Loved this salad!!! Tangy dressing and fresh field greens.. Shrimp were small though.  -Wild mushroom Pizza with chicken: This used to me my favorite pizza. I feel like there used to be more mushrooms with stronger flavors. The crust used to be perfect and kind of sweet. -Jambalaya Pasta: It was too spicy/peppery for me. I prefer Cheesecake Factory's version..  -Complimentary bread: Wasn't even warm & the butter was ice cold.    Service was friendly. I just think with so many other options at TS.. California Pizza Kitchen doesn't stand out. & if I really wanted their pizza I could get it in the frozen aisle at the grocery store.   HOT TIP: Go on their website for a $5 off coupon~!!!",

And now, despite growing in size and location, CPK has stayed mostly True to it's roots, keeping their food quality unchanged and the service above and beyond the norm. This is the first time me and the wife has tried CPK at this busy location (Town Square), one because it was always crowded, and two because being a tourist-centric location we feared it might take a toll on the quality of the food and service. We were delightfully proven wrong however, our server was friendly, attentive and prompt, our meal (Wild Mushroom Pizza and Chicken Piccata) arrived in a timely manner and tasted just how it was -- very good. We left fairly satisfied and happy knowing that CPK has achieved what most restaurant food chains have failed in growth: maintaining what you loved about them at the beginning.",

We've been longtime patrons of CPK but never encountered a waitress who deliberately went out of her way to annoy an irritate us with her poor service and unprofessional demeanor.  She should have just stayed home as she was obviously having a bad day instead of taking out her misplaced anger on longtime CPK customers like us.  Shame on CPK for hiring servers like her!",

Service acceptable. When we paid for the dinner, our credit card was \"lost\"!!! They searched for 1/2 hour and never found it. I left my name phone number and address with the manager and specifically asked for an update if they found it. Never happened. I canceled my card. Next day I called to see if they found it and magically they found it in the check cover with the bill. But they hadn't gotten around to calling and may never have had I not called them first. I'm very disappointed on the follow through and more at having to cancel my card wait for a new one and then not be informed of the originals finding. They have not earned my return especially the poor handling of the card and the complete lack of follow up. The manager needs to do immediate retraining and when things like this happen, have in place mechanisms that fix the problem, customer, and affix responsibility for follow through!!",

We had the thin crust pepperoni, the chop salad and an appetizer (I can't remember which one!?) to share and it was perfect!  A bonus to this location is being able to walk around Town Square afterwards :)",

When we asked for bread, she only gave us 3 pieces and we were four people while we saw a group of 2 get 5-6 pieces of breads. While we had our food she didn't come to see how the food was. While we were eating she just dropped down the bill  like she wanted us out in a hurry. My mother was eating her Cobb salad and the bacon was cold and raw. My father ordered a vegetarian pizza and asked for goat cheese and when the pizza came it had no goat cheese and on the bill they charged us extra for goat cheese. The pizza I ordered was a barbecue chicken and it was good. But like I said she rushed us out. When we were eating she came up to us and asked us for dessert. While my family was of course still eating. She deserved no tip at all. I would recommend while in Las Vegas. Don't go this California pizza kitchen. I'd  recommend the ones at downtown summerlin, which has excellent service and the fashion mall had a good one. But finally I've got to say WOW! A fast food place can do better than you guys.",

The host was very nice.. and we only had to wait about 8 minutes to be seated.  This place is pretty busy and I soon found out why.  They have comfortable booths with outside seating as well.  I had the Thai Chicken pizza (1st visit) and the Four Seasons Vegetarian pizza (2nd visit).  The portion was generous and if I remember correctly I paid $12.  The waiters and waitresses where very courteous and they made sure we were tooken care of.  A few weeks ago I noticed that they also have frozen pizza in the frozen food section at stores.  I bought a couple for me and my daughter and they were \"almost\" as good as the actual restaurant but still very good.  CPK is a great restaurant with great staff.",

I think it is a little pricey for what you are getting.  I can eat one of their pizzas by myself and still be hungry and then I'm out $12.  On the flip side, there really isn't anything wrong with it.  The service is always fine and their food tastes good.  I would just rather go somewhere like Settebello but when you have a pregant wife, what are you gonna do?",

They told me to the food would be ready at 5, I had ordered around 4:45 pm. I got there at 5:10 because I parked in the wrong lot. The pizza was in the oven ready. I couldnt believe it when he pulled it out. It was a bar pie - I was expecting something a bit larger. He brought the spinach dip over and put both in a bag and said I had to wait on the bread. A full ten minuted later he brought the bread over - he should have at least left the pizza in the pizza warmer  while I wait, at least it would have been warm when I got home. The pizza was nothing special - it was ok , the spinach dip was excellent and the pita (the only thing that actually was still warm when I got home) was good as well. I didn't like the price, I expected leftovers for $27 I made quick work of the pizza ,dip and bread and was still a little hungry.",

I had the Barbeque Chicken Pizza which was good, but they were light on the barbeque sauce. Also I had a Raspberry Mojito that was very watery, and my dessert was just average.

Lol there are plenty of good choices on the menu! I was stuck because I really wanted to order something fatty... but I knew I couldn't *insert crying emoji*. I settled for the chicken & veggies - sorry, I don't remember the exact name of the dish. My bf ordered the same thing & my friend had the pasta. We were given bread before our food came; it was hot & delicious! I like that they put herbs and I think chili flakes in the oil. The food came out maybe 15-20 mins later. The chicken & veggies were sooooo good. I was honestly surprised because I thought it would be bland. The portion was pretty big so I took half for my lunch the next day!   The service was okay, no complaints. She always made sure that our waters were filled but didn't really talk or ask questions much. Will definitely come back!",

The 4 years old baby had a kids cheese and tomato pizza ,my teenager daughter had some chicken with pasta and I had a salad with extra chicken breast . The kids have shared bites from each other's plates.  8-10 hours after the lunch both of kids can't stop throwing up. As a dad I can't express how I feel about this. From my intentions to provide them a nice lunch with their dad we end up into 24hours of pain and suffering for them. It's sad and sickening that this concept still stays in bussines.  Shame on you California Pizza Kitchen,I really hope you will close doors soon.",

    "text": "I've been to this location twice now and the first time I was unimpressed by the service. I wanted a sample of their new sangrias because they looked delicious (but i'm super picky) and was told that its made to order which is new to me because I know that they always premake batches of it early in the day or whenever they run out. Anyway, during the first visit, our server didn't check back with us after we received our food, nor did he offer any water refills.   However, I came back today because it was a birthday celebration. Service tonight was great! Our server was attentive and waters were refilled without us asking. Food is amazing as always.   3/5  wild mushroom strozzapreti- I wasn't a huge fan of the pasta, it was on the harder side so if I were to order this dish again, I would probably sub penne or fusilli for it. I don't believe there was a sauce to it... maybe just olive oil or something but I did enjoy the variety of mushrooms (not that I could tell the different mushrooms apart). My friend said the dish was kind of on the bitter side, but I only had two bites and couldn't really tell nor mind it.   4/5 Kung pao spaghetti with chicken-  despite all the dried red chili peppers, its not spicy! Spaghetti noodles were cooked perfectly, however it was on the salty side and lacked some peanuts. I gave two of my gfs a bite and they loved it.   5/5 Bbq chicken salad with avocado- I've tried lazy dog's, BJs and a few other restaurants' bbq chopped salad and they don't seem to compare to CPK's. The full sized salad made for a good appetizer for the table (party of 6)  before our entrees came out. I was glad that it wasn't drenched in dressing unlike previous visits.   While I didn't try the halibut, two of my gfs ordered it and said it was kind of dry. They did enjoy the farro and said that the halibut was a nice size.",

I sat at the bar, and had the greatest server. He needed a shoutout.  I asked him for suggestions on the menu, he had options for me, and suggested two salads, and something that caught my eye- the Spinach & Artichoke Pizza. We discussed in length the difference between that pizza and the classic BBQ Chicken. Well, His suggestions were great, didn't try to oversell me and cracked me up the entire time I was there.   The manager was near the bar area and was extremely involved in the kitchen as well as his serving staff, which was really nice to see.   I have been there twice while in Vegas, and while I love small local business, this is a place I will frequent.",

But it's in a busy area so I accept it.  I just wish it didn't have a wait.   The prices are the same and food is consistent.  I love there salads and appetizers here.  This is a great place for you and your friends to come in have a few drinks and appetizers then go shopping around at Town Square.  Great family atmosphere.

We told our waiter it was our first time and asked for recommendations, although he was a bit vague, we truly appreciated that he brought over a Complimentary appetizer item for us to try. He brought us a flatbread (cannot remember exactly which one..sorry) I thought it was a very nice gesture. Things like that don't happen much these days.  It as ok..a bit salty.  We ended up ordering the bbq chicken pizza, tequila chicken pasta and for appetizers the guacamole and blue corn dip with Chips.  I have to say I wasn't  really impressed.  Our pasta was hard and dip a little too sweet.  Pizza was ok, but nothing made me feel like It's someplace I'd purposely choose to go to again.  Waiter gets 5 stars",

We saw a table get seated approximately 10 minutes after us and they were waited on immediately. We still had menus on our table to indicate that we have yet to place our order and still no one would come by and wait on us.  Finally after 20 minutes we decided to leave, We walked past the same hostesses that seated us 20 minutes earlier and she automatically said their automatic goodbye \"thank you have a good day\"  we then advised them that we are leaving because we never got waited on to which they responded \"okay have a good day\" we then asked \"did you hear what we just said... we said, we are LEAVING because no one took our order\" she then asked what table number were you at? we just left after the fact that no one helped us and her only response was which table number are you at.  if you want to sit in peace and quiet and smell pizza then is the place for you however if you are looking for a place to eat then i suggest you try another restaurant in town square",

Coincidentally the last two times we have gotten the same waitress  (Melissa ) the first time was a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly busy the service was mediocre but the food was good. The second visit was this afternoon.  It wasn't busy at all but we were sat down and greeted by a friendly waiter who stated our waitress was Melissa and she would be with us shortly. The first gentleman took our drink order and returned immediately with our drinks and some bread for snacking. We waited approximately 30 minutes and watched our waitress serve another table their food and greet another table but never having  approached  us. Finally we decided we had waited long enough  and began to walk out finally our waitress  came up and asked where we were leaving too. Needless to say I will not be back again. The food is good but the service isn't worth the wait.",

Avocado eggrolls, baja/Thai rolls, spin dip with pita as the best apps ever, not just from here but any chain. You can't beat the flavor and quality of those ones. Yes, this is a pizza place. But we come here for the salads. Great portions for a great price. If you haven't had the roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken you are not living life! Also the Thai crunch salad is probably one of the best salads out there, you need avocado on this one to fully bring it to realization but you'll really enjoy it if you're into peanuts. Many other places make Amazon BBQ chicken salads, but this is the place that gave everyone the opportunity to sell them. Get the salad if you're into originals. The Sicilian pizza with extra sauce and Serrano peppers until death and the chicken and shrimp marinara pasta will forever be my one love (unless the broccoli fusilli comes back) CPK is a part of my soul. I love this restaurant.The food here will forever take me to a time frame of my life that I truly valued and enjoyed for this is my favorite place to eat. Ever.",

Love the location in Town Square and had I had more time, I'd have been looking around at all the great stores there.

Service was marginal even though she tried. Water glass went empty, took a long time for food. when food arrived soups were hot, pasta was warm and the flatbread pizza was barely warm.   Our waitress was very pleasant, replaced our flatbread with a smile, but did not check back with us for sometime, we requested additional pesto sauce - brought it 10 minutes later.  Overall:  Nice location; very clean; friendly; food presentation good, food was okay (pesto pasta was good); service just okay.  I will not go back, there are many other choices.

    "text": "Normally. I have good experiences at California Pizza Kitchen, but the service experienced on 10/1 at this location was horrendous. Apparently, we had just missed a big rush since it was homecoming weekend for one of the high schools. We got there as the rush ended, and we're seated within 10 minutes.  Our server started out friendly and talkative at first. But as time progressed, the service went downhill. It took at least 15 min for us to get our appetizer, and then about 45 minutes to get our pizza. Not only that,  but the server never apologized for how long it was taking for our food to come out. I noticed another table of 5 (compared to our 2) had ordered the same appetizer, and received it quicker than we did. Hummus shouldn't take 15 minutes. Also, once we got the pizza,  the server made sure that it was not made with wheat since that's what I'm allergic to...however....I found it very odd that he said he made our pizza himself. Once we were ready for our check,  the process took another 10 to 15 minutes since we didn't know where our server was, and we had to ask someone else if we could have our check. Our server seemed to be in lala land. I used to be a server myself, and had the service been 20% better, the server probably would have received a better tip, and not $2, and I wouldn't be taking my business elsewhere due to the lack of customer service at this restaurant. I gave this place 2 stars because while the service was horrendous, the food was still good. But I probably won't be back here based on the service received.",

Food was much better and much more what you would expect.  The waitress was the deal sealer for a 4 star rating though.  Amazing service and worth the 4 star rating upgrade.  Original review - 2 stars: I want to start off by saying I have eaten at many California Pizza locations, but for some reason this one was wildly different than others.  The sauce was oily and runny, the crust was overcooked, and it seemed almost too thin.  The toppings didn't seem fresh either.  I can't imagine all their pizza is like this but I won't be heading back to this location again.",

Angie told us we were her first ever table serving, as she normally works the to-go counter! She totally rocked it!  I had the Mac n cheese bites and they keep getting smaller each visit. Also enjoyed my pesto multi grain penne with chicken! The sun dried tomatoes are what MAKES this dish.   The salted caramel pudding is a definite each visit as well. That or the butter cake. Make sure you indulge in your dessert or walk next door to Godiva for some delicious chocolate ice cream!   I can't wait to be back. That pesto carne asada pizza was a weird experience but I'm totally getting it again.",

What makes it even worse is when I confronted her about it, she had the audacity to claim we never went up to her and we sat right by them, literally the bench closest to them! This is a prime example of one of my pet peeves when eating out. Be more attentive and do your job!!! I have proof of the time we sat down with a picture if she reads this!

When about 15 minutes passed we were called. The Host tried to seat us at a table meant for 4. As we realized that it would be pretty tight, I noticed a number of tables which were empty. It amounted to a whole section which was closed as they ran a wait list. We asked for another table with more room and we were directed to wait again.   When we got our new table about 10 minutes after that we noticed that the section was still closed.   For an appetizer we ordered the white corn guacamole and chips. For dinner, we ordered the California Veggie Pizza and a Roasted Veggie Salad.   The guacamole came out right away. The portion was rather small and in my opinion lacked flavor. We added salt to it.   Dinner took a while to come out, in my opinion, longer than it should have. When it did we again found that the California Veggie Pizza lacked flavor and needed salt. I will say that the Roasted Veggie Salad was good.   With so many other restaurants in Town Square to chose from, CPK needs to step up their game.",

I got the chocolate souffle cake for dessert and didn't care for it much, it was pretty bitter chocolate cake. I would recommend the butter cake, however. We elected to sit outside with our two kids and were a little worried when we sat down about being forgotten about since it seems pretty secluded on their patio but our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We were never left to sit there wondering when someone would come check on us. The only complaint is that since TownSquare is right next to the airport, we were sitting right underneath the flight path and it was very loud every 3-5 minutes or so when the planes would fly over, and though that is obviously not CPK's fault, it did interfere with our experience a bit. Still, I would recommend this restaurant for couples, families, colleagues, and even going alone. Very pleasant atmosphere.",

    "text": "This is my first time going to California Pizza Kitchen. Our server was nice and gave us a complimentary bianco bread( oily cheese bread)- which I can't have because I can't dairy. So I stared at it lol. I ate the bread though. I ordered the, SMASHED CHICKEN MEATBALL PIADINA - Housemade chicken meatballs, crushed tomato sauce with wilted baby kale, fresh herb gremolata and Parmesan mustard aioli.   It's a Saturday and I ordered off the lunch menu- back page. It says on the menu the full sandwiches you can order all day every day. The waiter told me I wasn't supposed to order it because it was Saturday. How about you create 2 menus if you don't want people to order from that side? even though it said I could. He said he'd make it happen. So 45 minutes late we get our food( my bf ordered soup only). If I knew they were going to take that long I wouldn't have ordered it. We were running in for a quick bite. We were in a rush to leave so once we got our food we asked for the check and to go boxes. I received my food and realized it was $15( which I wasn't told ahead of time) for just the meatball thing, no sides... Who doesn't want a side? I opened it up and realized it was a cheese pizza folded with some meatball pieces inside. I can't have cheese! WTF? well parmesan is okay but there was freaking mozzarella everywhere. I don't know if that's what it is supposed to be? Really pissed off and had to go. I honestly didn't have time to argue or anything so I took it to go. I still have yet to eat my \"pizza\" with a few meatballs, or should i call it flatbread with meatballs since I am now going to have to scrape off the whole thing...Don't mess with my food I get really angry lol. Honestly I won't go back cause I'm way too stubborn. Just really irritated  Update: heated it up and could only eat half cause the cheese was stuck. The meatballs had good flavor but way to greasy. I stopped eating after  a few bites and threw it away",

I was in a rush because I only had about an hour and 20 something minutes to head to work. Starving and coming up a little late on a lunch with my friend, we requested our food to arrive ASAP because of our situation. Our server was extremely kind (I believe her name was Heidi? Wonderful lady!) and got our food out to us in a matter of minutes. Even with our indecision about what wine to taste, she was doing the best she could to help us get in and out (even when her section was half full!) Our food had to have came out in a matter of 10-15 at most after we ordered, because we devoured it and still had time for me to head to work with a minute late to spare. My service experience was excellent, and I recommend if you're in a rush somewhere, don't be shy to tell them!  Otherwise, the food is three stars. This isn't saying its bad in the least, but then again there is nothing overly special about it either. The menus do hold a ton of variety when it comes to wines and pizza, so if you're in for a quick lunch, this would be the place in TS to stop by at!",

I dont blame him for bit checking on us since I'm sure this isn't his usual duties.",

    "text": "I just had lunch here with my friend and her new baby. We asked if we could sit somewhere where the stroller could be parked nearby and the hostess told us that strollers weren't allowed in the restaurant. So we took the car seat out if the stroller and they showed us to a booth. The booths were really cramped and the car seat wouldn't fit on the booth seat. This other hostess took the car seat out of my friends hands and basically wedged it between the table and the back of the booth. Ummmm... Not safe. We asked for a sling and they said the slings couldn't be set out because it would be a fire hazard. A few minutes later I looked behind me and there was a lady sitting at a table with her stroller parked next to her and on the other side of the restaurant was a woman with her car seat on a sling. Fail.  Update: I sent a note via their website asking how/why this happened.  A manager from the restaurant called me and apologized for the incident and sent me a gift certificate to use at any CPK restaurant.  I haven't received the gift certificate yet, but I appreciated the prompt apology and their effort to address what happened.",

    "text": "I like California Pizza Kitchen. It is a great go-to restaurant that is sure to please everyone.  The only reason why I gave this particular location 3/5 stars is because of the service. My sisters and I are regulars at the CPK in the Fashion Show Mall. The service there is always excellent. It's weird how we took  it for granted until we started frequenting the CPK at Town Square. The CPK at Town Square has inferior service. They lag on refilling drinks/water, are slow to greet, take your meal order, check on you, etc. Once, we've even gotten a straight up rude waitress. However, the service seems to be improving the last few times I've been. So there is hope!",

    "text": "Dined here with my boyfriend for a late breakfast/early lunch while on this side of town running errands. The ambience inside the restaurant is really pleasant with lots of spacious windows filling the place with sunlight and the woodfire oven mirroring it with bright yellow tile. It's a very pretty space to dine in and the grand windows allow you ample people watching of all the hipsters ambling by.   The restaurant was packed while we were there, so service was a little slow. I had a cup of coffee that was a little stale, but the refill was much better. The coffee wasn't bitter and seemed like more of a light roast. I like that the cream comes in a small glass! Be aware that any of the espresso based drinks run about the same as Starbucks prices. They seemed to have a decent selection of beers but it was too early for me to dwell on them long.  We started with their minestrone soup, which was thick with different ingredients but wasn't mindblowingly amazing. I've had a richer depth of flavor in homemade versions, but it was a decent restaurant adaptation.   The salad we sampled had arugula, asparagus, parmesan, almonds and a few other simple toppings. It was a light starter on a long rectangular plate that made it easy to share between the two of us.   We had their vegetarian pizza with japanese eggplant and it was nice but fairly small. You would definitely need two pizzas if you were with a group of three or more very hungry people. Since we had shared a salad and a soup prior to having the pizza, it was a good amount of food to sustain us through \"brunch\"-time with two slices left over to provide a light meal for my boyfriend later in the day.   The pizza had a thin crust with a nice chewiness to it and the toppings were well chosen for the pizza but a little sparsely placed. There were large pieces of broccolini/broccoli rabe/baby broccoli that were hard for me to bite through and interrupted the otherwise lovely texture medley. I don't recall the eggplant standing out, which was a little disappointing but it may have just been covered in cheese.   Next time we venture over to this area there's a good chance we'll return to sample some of their other pizzas with some friends so we can have a better sampler of their offerings!",

    "text": "I'm not one to write reviews for larger chains mainly because if you've eaten at one it's very likely the other chain in the other part of town isnt much different.   Other reviews for this CPK are a tad old so now would be a great time for a refresher review.  Due to it's location at Towne Center the place is kinda packed with local shoppers and tourists alike, being crowded means being noisy, servers do tend to rush to get finished customers out and new customers in to keep the business moving. This is nothing new and should not count toward their overall score unless they stand there staring at you arms cross tapping their foot in a gesture that clearly says 'order desert or GTFO'  I completely agree with Ken O's observation that some of the menu items are a tad on the expensive side and are a bit too exotic. The chain seems to focus on a shot gun spread approach instead of specializing.   After over two years going to continue on Audrey W's review and report that the BBQ Chicken Pizza is still light on the sauce but still tasted pretty good.   Lettuce wraps were pretty awesome but they need to use fresher shrimp. The texture of the diced up frozen stuff they use is too mushy and it doesn't stand out among the other ingredients. Same goes with their water chestnuts as well, out of the entire entree i can only recall biting into something crisp that wasn't lettuce maybe three times.  Buddy got the standard 'oldie but goodie' pepperoni pizza. The pie was a bit greasy but a pepperoni pizza not having a noticeable layer of shine on top is like a zebra not having black and white stripes. One thing i did notice was the taste of the areas that didnt contain pepperoni. They were like black holes sucked away all the flavor and experience to leave you plain and unsatisfied.   From reading past almost year old reviews i can say the service has improved. There's a manager on the floor helping out the servers and ensuring quality control and getting feedback. Our own server was like a hawk...with video cameras...and a surveillance van commonly seen in police films and movies. If i were to give him a motto for the day it would have to be \"leave no glass empty\" seriously he swapped out our drinks when we had only a quarter left and during that time between debating if one should get the bill and call it or order a dessert and dread the gym the next day he still refilled our drinks. Homeboy hooked it up and earned himself a phat tip in the end.  Overall I can predict we'll be coming back here within the next three months.",

    "text": "I have eaten at this place 3 times. The first time was great, the second was not good at all. We went back for a 3rd time because we wanted to give it one last chance. Unfortunately when we got there we were told there was no bread to be served, understandable on a busy Saturday night. However it's what took place after that really sealed the deal on whether or not we would return. The waitress brought me a Dr. Pepper that she later admitted she knew was watered down and after she dropped it off with our food, she didn't return for 15 minutes. So, I went my entire meal without a drink. When she returned, which only happened after I requested for the manager, she said she knew it was watered down but served it anyway instead of changing the soda in the back. She made us wait continuously throughout the night for refills, desert and even for our check. I don't complain often, but the icing on the cake was when she brought our check after us waiting for another 10 minutes for it she circled where the tip chart was on the bottom and she made it seem as if we wouldn't have tipped If she hadn't. This was all at 9 o'clock at night when there was maybe 3 tables in her area. The manager was helpful, but I'm not one to complain in store when I have to keep the waiter. The food was good, but such slow service I wouldn't likely return.",

Very happy since I switched to Red Baron!!  Okay, back to CPK..  Now, I visit for the first time in over 8 years. I went to the location at Town Square. After a 40 minute wait, we were seated.  I didn't mind the wait since we bought an iMac from the Apple Store while waiting.  I also had enough time to shop at The Container Store.  Okay, maybe the wait was more than 40 minutes.   We were seated in a nice booth.  We had an opportunity to look at the menu and were greated by a waitress that was quiry to say the least. She had a quite intensity. I dare not upset her. I was extra nice to her and she seemed to respomd well to the nice gesture. When my buddy's gf wasn't paying much attention, the server became aggitated.  I felt then need to apologize for the gf's lack of attention.  Anyways, the meal was good.  The toppings were thick.   The only was that the server disappeared for long periods.  Our drinks ran empty three times and nobody was to be found. She also took a long time to bring and process the check.  The whole process from start to finish took two hours. We only ordered two pizzas and some drinks.  My friend did not like his Bloody Mary. I had strawberry tea, which was good.    Normally, I would be unhappy about the long wait and the even longer service, but at least I had already accomplished my shopping and we weren't late for the movie we came to see.  Maybe we saved money since the girls didn't have time to shop.  I wouldn't visit this CPK again.  Good food, bad everything else.  There are tons of great restaurants at the outlet mall down the street.",

She was very friendly, our server Tyler was amazing from the moment we sat down. He was constantly refilling our drinks, asking us if we needed anything and he was so nice! He told us to save some room for dessert but unfortunately we did not. The food was delicious, I wish I would've take it to go but we had a movie to see after.

The lettuce wraps and sesame chicken dumplings (pot stickers) are great if you're after appetizers. When we've decided on our own entrees, my favorite is the kung pao spaghetti. It's a little bit stronger than I prefer but when they have a good cook in the kitchen I can get it tamed down without being bland.  Prices are a little on the high side, but not by much and only when I order more than I probably should have anyway. Bread is just by request now. I've always left full.",

Even the CPK I always go to at home, the service sucks! I am just surprised since I know people who work at CPK and I know how strict and intense their training is when people are hired. Regardless, I continue to return because I love the food.  While we were at this location, the service was just blah and SO SLOW. the restaurant was empty, but it took forever to get our food. On top of that, they didn't have the AC on and it was so hot and stuffy in the restaurant that everyone I ate with was uncomfortable and sneezing. After we complained, they turned the AC on and it got much better. I was just really surprised no one else in the restaurant complained. But anyone who works at the restaurant should know that the AC should be on in a restaurant. I knew it was off cause once we complained, I felt the AC blowing on me. *End of rant*",

So if I have to order one by my self , plus salad or pasta and dessert it gets pricey for a non fancy restaurant. There's also better pizza places for lower price. We also tried their summer drink cucumber mojito (non-alcoholic) we didn't like it. The strawberry shortcake was good.  On the other hand, their service is very poor. There was no many people and our server was hard to get, every time we need him. He also never stop by to offer refills or find out if we need anything else, besides when he served our food. He took too long for serving and pizza was already cold by the time it reached our table. I saw him texting on his phone couple of times when I was trying to get his attention.",

So if you want to eat on Tuesday you should place your order on Monday because that is how long it takes for them to deliver the food to your table!  And then be prepared to get terrible food...  Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention that the lemon in the water looked as if someone had already bitten into it when they served it.  No need to tell the waiter about it because he will argue with you saying that's the way it is cut \"teeth marks\" are included in the cut!  So don't waste your time at this place, they're just pitiful and disgusting!,,",

Lots of seating.   Our server asked if we had ever been here before. We said no. I ordered a mojito and it was really good and refreshing. We both had a pizza each. My friend got the carnitas pizza sooo good! And I had the Hawaiian. It was good but too much green stuff on top. I think it was shredded green onion, not sure but I pulled most of it off. We had the Thai spring rolls (2) ok those were interesting in a good way. Loved the peanut dip that came with them. They were more of a taquito than a spring roll. Rolled up in a flower tortilla.   The manager visited our table prior to our food coming and after the bread olive oil arrived. She gave us one of the new flat breads. It was all cheese and some sage. It was interesting. Tasted like nachos for some reason. I can't stand sage. So it isn't something I would order. But it was free food so you know I ate it! With all the appetizers I was soooo full that I ate only two pieces of my pizza. Then had to go back to work and smell pizza until I got home and at it for dinner",

We had arrived around 630-645ish and were seated within 5 minutes. We had opt'ed to sit outside because the weather had been amazing these past few days. One side to outdoor seating was already full. The other side had two 2-person tables left.   Our waiter had came fairly soon after we had been seated and got our drink orders placed. We had both opted for a \"uniquely non-alcoholic\" drink  Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler which consisted of fresh strawberries hand-shaken w/ Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava, and ginger.   Not too sweet. Quite refreshing. Nice to enjoy on a nice day out :) We both had enjoyed our drinks. I ate her strawberries too. There was a slice of lime in the drink too ! No i didnt eat that Lol   ---------------------------  Along with our drink orders, we had ordered some food as well. Not too much, but enough to hold us until the event which had desserts and champagne provided.. XD   Before our food came out, we were served with some fresh warm bread with a small bowl of olive oil and herb. The bread was super tasty and fresh. Nice crispy crust and soft inside. The olive oil and herb tasted really nice as well !   Spinach Artichoke Dip served hot with housemade blue & white corn tortilla chips  Surprisingly for an appetizer, its quite the large portion of dip. Their housemade chips were thin and crispy. The dip isnt too overpowering/strong but creamy and delicious. Yummy !   Carne Asada Pizza w/ tender marinated steak, fire-roasted poblanos, cilantro pesto, yellow onions, mozzarella, monterey jack cheese and fresh cilantro served with housemade salsa verde  This was like... a taco as a pizza. \"New item\" on the menu. Lol the steak was indeed tender, topped with the side of housemade salsa verde really made this like a taco. Very tasty. Fairly decent to try ! Ingredients melded pretty nice and worked well together.   Even with this amount of food, we still had 2 slices of pizza leftover, which i had taken home to eat as a snack later that night HAHA !   ------------------------  Overall, great experience. Was nice to enjoy the nice outdoor weather while its lasts cuz everyone knows vegas weather is bipolar. Also nice to have a nice partner to enjoy it with hehe",

This location is conveniently located smack in the middle of Town Square near Whole Foods and The Container Store.  We arrived just before noon and waited a few minutes to be seated. The restaurant was nearly full for lunch on a weekday. Once seated our waitress came over soon after to take our drink orders and then our food orders when we were ready. She didn't waste time getting orders in, but didn't rush us to order either.  The menu has a nice variety of options and they definitely offer more than just pizza. The lunch combination option had quite a few items to choose from and was reasonably priced. It includes pizza, sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were fun drink options like non-alcoholic refreshers and teas too. Calorie counts are listed next to each item which made it easy to make a smarter choice.  I went with the combination of Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza and a Caesar Salad. The salad was tasty and I liked the garlic croutons. The pizza was a nice size. I liked the overall flavor and the crust on the pizza. We had to pass on dessert since we were on a lunch break, but they had some good looking options that I'd love to try next time.",

I added some balsamic vinegar to make it just right.   This location was recently remodeled and has a new fresh look inside. The staff was very warm and welcoming and even brought us out a Bianco Flatbread for coming in today. This included whipped truffle cream, gorgonzola, mozzarella cheeses and fresh sage. Very nice of them.  For the meal we decided on splitting a full size Thai Crunch, we could have had a half size but now I have some leftovers for dinner. The salad was delicious and comes with crisp veggies and fresh cilantro, chicken and peanuts, wontons and rice sticks, then it's tossed in a Thai peanut dressing. We also added fresh avocado to the salad ($3 up charge).  The avo complemented the salad and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Thank you CPK  for a great lunch.",

That's a different review though let me give some credit where it is due! Specifically for this visit to the Town Square location my co worker invited me to a nice business lunch. We arrived and of course the place was packed because hello it's lunch time duh!   Talked to the hostess about the wait and was quayside maybe 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we were finally seated and I can't be made because hey it was only 5 minutes of a difference! I was looking for something light and not really in the mood for pizza but seriously who declines a free lunch? Not me!   Ahh but if course they have an extensive menu with alternate options so why not be open to a spinach And quinoa said with a nice piece of Salmon on top! Sounds good to me! I washed it down with one of the new refreshing cucumber mint drinks! Super yummy and out server made it an effort to not let my glass stay empty that was the best part! The full portion salad is huge and I really should've down the lunch size but whatever it was so worth it! The service here was amazing so I really have to come back again this time not for business so I can have a great cocktail! Great job CPK!",

You can also order your Pizza with a cauliflower crust for those who want to avoid wheat or gluten or simply have an alternative.  I got the shrimp scampi pizza and I ordered it with a cauliflower crust. It was absolutely delicious!!! Fresh ingredients, extremely tasty and the cauliflower crust is a total winner! It's my new favorite!   The staff are very friendly, they came by to check on our meal, topped up our tea and made sure we had everything we needed.  It's a popular place so can be busy, expect a 15 minute wait at lunch time, it can be less if you want to sit at the bar.   The booths are very roomy and comfy and my place of choice to sit. For me this place is worth the wait as it is consistently good every time I go there. They have great salads and great choice of menu. And for  Pizza lovers, this place is excellent!!!",

CPK is a great place to stop for lunch, dinner, or drinks.  It is great for kids, because, well, what kid doesn't like pizza?  They have so many interesting pizza options, from the typical pizza to the \"who would have thought of that?\" My wife always enjoys their salads.  Portions are big. I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day.  The staff at CPK is always friendly and helpful. This always helps make a trip to CPK enjoyable.",

I called the store to let her know and ended up speaking with Hailey, the manager on duty. She is unbelievably kind, accommodating and understanding. Completely fixed the mix up and then some!!

I had the Italian chopped salad which was $10 for a half portion, not that I'm gluttonous but it is as if they split half of a half order. My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was dry. Their notable BBQ chicken pizza in which I tried to just see what the rave was all about. Point blank there is nothing worth raving. Personally, it's overrated and I rather just go to Brio.",

But tonight 10/10/17 our waiter was James we were there probably a good hour and a half and we only saw him when we ordered, got our food, one refill and to check out. I guess we were the last table of his for the night, but we had to wait and wait for him to come out from the back to even get his attention. He gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there and he was in a hurry because he wouldn't even let us answer his questions, he would just answer for us. (He asked if we wanted boxes and before we could answer he just said okay three boxes it is and walked off before we even asked the questions we needed to ask or even order out desert) We just didn't even bother with the second dessert we just decided to leave. It was so bad that I contemplated even talking to the manager because when we were leaving we payed and he came back right away to ask where his tip was. Honestly I cannot fathom how terrible tonight was. But to our past waiters/waitresses thank you for your hospitality. We did not leave a tip but I am not sorry for not leaving the waiter a tip but I am sorry for the buss boy who won't be getting his portion. We were going to give it directly to him but did not see him as we were leaving.",

I had an unfortunate dining experience somewhere else before stepping into CPK hoping for redemption this evening. My friend and I sat down at the bar and Dylan took our drink order and asked if we wanted some warm bread as we perused the menu. We laughed and told him about our previous experience at the other place and said we've had plenty of bread because that's practically all we got at the other place. He apologized for our bad experience at the other restaurant more than the other staff had. We ordered drinks and food and when we were done Chef Al came to greet us with a beautiful desert dish of red velvet cake and a script of chocolate spelled out \"WELCOME\". We promised that we would never make the mistake of going to CPK second again... They will always be our first choice!!!   THANKS DYLAN AND CHEF AL!",

I ordered my food from the small plates section. I had my own asparagus and arugula salad and split the Bianco flatbread with my friend.   The arugula salad was perfectly light and not drenched in dressing like some salads are. It was a complete balance of bitterness from the arugula and sweetness from the fire roasted tomatoes. The cheese was sliced so thin that you could see through it, so it also gave the salad a nice savory touch.  The Bianco flatbread was stunningly delicious. It was brushed with a thin layer of truffle oil and garnished with a little bit of greens and covered in mozzarella cheese. Within every bite was a whiff of truffle oil. It was a definite five stars overall for the food.  I knocked off a star from my rating of CPK because our waitress seemed to be new at her job. She was nervous while taking our order, but she was kind and quick enough to serve us complimentary bread with oil (which wasn't the best bread I've ever indulged on).  However, when we were finished with our food, she came to get our plates, and because she seemed nervous, she accidentally dropped one of our plates on the table and broke it. We knew it was an accident, but I saw the manager standing close by looking at us, and she didn't do anything about it.  However, my experience was wonderful at CPK minus the part where the service was a little lacking in confidence and management. I'll definitely be back, but will be hoping for another server.",

They warned us they were in construction and they were sorry the floors were tore up. It didn't bother us though, no construction was being done at that time!  On to the food! We ordered spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and we finished it right before our food arrived. It's sad I was pleasantly surprised by this because half the time they come out with the food! The chips seemed a little stale but the dip was amazing, it wasn't chunky which I enjoyed better. We than shared mahi mahi tacos (with avocado $1.25 more) and a thin crust three meat pizza. The mahi mahi tacos were huge and very delicious, the avocado was also perfect! The pizza was a little spicy and we liked all the meat it had to offer!!  Side note if you sign up for their rewards on your next visit you get a free small plate. I signed up on the spot and now it shows I have a free small plate and $10 off of $40! Pretty awesome and we will be back Friday with our little one!",

We also got the peach salad and I just really didn't like it because of the cottage cheese and raisins. But the complimentary bread we got was great.

Now I definitely regret even putting this on my to do list, or my \"tackle the yummy\" list.  It's a typical Sunday in Las Vegas, hot and windy. I Mountaintown Square on Las Vegas Blvd. and I'm hungry. So of course I would love to go try something new. Hence California pizza kitchen. So my mother arrives we decide to go in and try it.   All I can say is disappointing! The food lackluster and locked flavor. The presentation was less than heart. And the prices were outrageous. Not to mention their major competitor is Sammy's woodfired pizza. Sammy is offers gluten-free variations of pastas and crusts to appeal to a wider variety of people. To my surprise California pizza kitchen only has five pizzas that you can get the gluten-free crust and has absolutely no other gluten-free menu and no gluten-free pasta. Being a celiac this was disappointing!   Now let's talk about the service. The gentleman seated us was very nice and the weather was nice but completely uneducated in anything that has to do with any aspect of anything Culinary. When I inquired about if they had pasta that was made without me because my son had a dairy allergy he replied \"well the only pasta with diary is going to be our fettuccine Alfredo or mac & cheese.\"obviously I know that Alfredo and macaroni and cheese obviously has \"cheese\" and has Dairy. So why would I order that for my son? Wouldn't. Again I stated \"no, my son has all dairy allergies including eggs. So again that your pasta have eggs?\" He quickly ran to go check and came back and stated that all their pasta egg. Again very disappointing.  All in all besides the lack of a gluten-free menu, the lack of ambience, the lack of an educated staff, and the outrageous prices, the food  was lack luster and was not visually appealing. Tasteless food never is a recipe for success. Maybe there other restaurants have better chefs? Maybe that's how they got so big? I'm not sure, however I am not on the California pizza kitchen bandwagon!",

    "text": "I worked at CPK in 1987. I'm a fan and very familiar with their menu.  Calling this place and getting the take out girl on the phone was enough to break glass, the girl's whiny fake voice is unbearable.  I ordered a salad SPECIFICALLY to include bread, and as per expected with this world of 0.0 attention span of those under 25, there was no bread.   When I inform her that I asked for bread, she has no reaction at all, and when I say the word \"that I specifically\" asked, she is taken back because she now knows that I know it was her who took my order and it was she who screwed up and tried to lie about it.  These people need to be trained that a customer has an \"experience\" when they come to your business.  That experience begins finding parking, who greets them at the door, etc, etc.  How likely am I to order take out again, knowing that the person who answers the phone doesn't pay attention, and doesn't care that she doesn't.  It wasn't that it happened, it's that she didn't care that she screwed up. It was her attitude, and her mouth, and her body language.",

Our server Damon made an excellent recommendation for an appetizer, and he made sure to let us know our pizza would take a little longer because it was gluten free (good to know).  Excellent follow up service making sure everything was perfect.  When we were ready to leave, Damon was check ready and had our ticket processed quickly.  The only reason for a 4-star rating is serving size.  For the cost, the pizza could be a little larger.

I ordered my usual-a Thai chicken pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad, and the side by side soup with smashed pea and tortilla. The pizza was drenched in bean sprouts and carrots. I know that's part of the topping, but I've never seen them put so much. It really overpowered the pizza and made it soggy. The salad didn't have enough dressing and I paid extra for avocado which came with 4 tiny pieces. The soup was cold when it was served. Only good thing was the service, hence the 2 stars.  Btw, I came in an hour before closing.",

Our server, Rachel (from Maryland by way of Austin), was overly friendly. She was so bubbly, it was almost exhausting. At her suggestion, I ended up getting a Kiwi Frozen Lemonade with a shot of Absolut. Excellent suggestion. It was very good! By the way, their White Sangria is also delicious.  I didn't plan on eating, but CPK has such a wide selection of salads, I couldn't resist getting their Moroccan Chicken Salad. I should have gone with a half because that thing was huge! And boy was it delicious. I especially like it for the roasted butternut squash, dates, beets, avocado, and toasted almonds. Yum!  Well done CPK.",

I've been to this location as well as others and have never received the terrible service I received today. We waiting for 15 minutes for a table...not a problem! It was myself and my 4 kids on a lunch date. Once we got seated, rosabel took our drink order. It was 15 minutes before we got our drinks. When she brought our drinks, she took our food order. By now it was 1245pm.  We then waited another 20 minutes before Angie came and asked if we were ok and brought us bread. She said she understands how it can be with 4 kids so here's some bread to pass the time. First off, it's part of the service.  That was also the first time anyone came to check on our table since they took our order. We then waited for another 30 minutes before Angie came back and apologized for the wait and said she would have her manager come by to see what they could do for us since we waited for over an hour by this point. Shortly after her apology, the food came. We ate and at that point finally got our first refill on our drinks. Once we finished, Angie came back to see if we needed boxes and to bring the check.  The manager never came by like Angie said and the total bill for such service was over $50. Angie said she would be back to collect payment. We waiting another 10 minutes and finally I had my daughter walk it to her. Rosabel then brought it back and we walked out of the restaurant 2 hours after walking in. Definitely not the best experience and very reluctant to go back.",

The gluten free crust was soft and spongy and tasted so terrible. Probably 4 tiny pieces of chicken, hardly any sauce and a few onions. So many other pizza places to get a great gluten free pizza, this is not the place!!!",

    "text": "I must say:  Pleasantly Surprised!  I enjoyed this one even more so than the one located in the Mirage Hotel.  They now have a 'low calorie' menu, it's definitely more pricey than their other menu, but sometimes you have to pay not to be tempted.  You can go online and download a full and comprehensive caloric menu from their website.  For instance, ordering the pizza thin crust makes a pretty big difference.  Our server was very bubbly and attentive, she was their corporate trainer based on the pin on her lapel, dark hair really cute glasses.   They have 1/2 salads and full portions too, which is nice. I ordered the under 500 calorie shrimp scampi zucchini pasta--I loved it. Especially for being healthy. It had tons of garlic and a lot of flavor. I added spinach and roasted red peppers to it for some more veggies. I'm going to try and replicate it at home. It was very very good.  My friend ordered lettuce wraps [chicken and shrimp which somehow has more calories & fat than just the chicken or just the shrimp? which is confusing but whatever] she ate 'em up. Her husband ordered a 1/2 salad which he finished in it's entirety and then managed to eat a couple of her lettuce wraps.  Food took a little longer than I would've liked to come out, but it was very busy. Would also love if they served some pizza bread for a starter [even though that is not on the diet].  1/2 salad & 1/2 pizza option would be very nice too.  Music was very loungey this time I felt like I was in a nightclub, kind of techno funky was unusual but I didn't mind it.  I also took out a to-go order for one of our co-workers, when I was walking out the manager basically bolted to open the door for me [and he was in mid discussion with the hostess]. I *love*  men with manners. A+",

I paid $2 extra for shrimp & $2 extra for fish added to my salad & asked to not have the chicken in my salad (I eat seafood but no red meat or chicken /pescetarian)...I got chicken & no fish or shrimp & paid an extra $4 for that  2.  I ordered a full sized salad & it was the equivalent of a half size in the restaurant (I've ordered many times in the restaurant & know the portion sizes) 3.  Ordered 3 pizzas & they were different sizes (2 small & 1 large & they are small enough to begin with). Wtf?  Why were they different sizes?  Also one of pizzas wasn't covered in cheese, you could see the dough blank of anything. 4.   We usually get some bread as we do when we're in the restaurant & I've gotten it when I've picked up my own To Go orders, but not this time (my kids love the bread). 5.   There's no kids menu & my kids were disappointed when the small plate mac & cheese (closest I could find) was some sort of fried cheese ball.  Luckily I also had gotten them pasta dish as well (which was good).  The only reason it gets 2 stars is bcz if you go into restaurant it's better as you can ask for corrections & the good does taste good.  But if I'm spending this much on food to be delivered I want the same quality of service.   I eat out/order in food for the family 5/7 days & Cal Pizza Kitchen will no longer be ordered from us & prob won't even go in again bcz of the bad taste of food/service of delivery left in mouth.",

    "text": "There's a lot of places to get pizza here in town, and when you ask about it you typically get a lot of names, from the local restaurants like Metro Pizza and Angelina's to the chains. One of those chains -- California Pizza Kitchen -- is among my favorite pizza joints in town, representing West Coast-style pizza; for that I have a completely different pizza place in mind, which I will discuss in a future review. For now, though, I will focus on CPK!  I came out here with my mother and her work friends a week or so ago as part of their monthly outings, and CPK tends to not be too busy during the weekdays. It's usually the weekends, like the Friday we came in, that we need a reservation. In our case, though, we were able to get a table relatively quickly. Though we ordered a lot of food, I will specifically focus on my menu items -- the tomato basil bisque, the roasted vegetable salad, the roasted garlic chicken pizza, and the strawberry shortcake a la mode.  I arrived later than everyone this time around, so I was the last to order -- despite that, my food came out at the same time as everyone else's, which I appreciated! However, my mother and her companions noted that we had trouble flagging down our server for napkins, refills, and even the checks, which detracted somewhat from our experience.  Food-wise, I started with the tomato bisque and roasted vegetable salad -- both of which were light, refreshing and very flavorful! In particular, their tomato soup actually tasted like tomatoes, and wasn't overly sweet like other soups that I had. The salad had a very light but refreshing dressing that helped bring it and the roasted vegetables together -- both of these items could have made for a light meal by themselves!  Afterwards, my roasted garlic chicken pizza came out -- and the first thing I noticed was that it had plenty of garlic, which I appreciate since I love a lot of garlic on my food! ( Not so much a good thing if you plan to speak to people or go out with someone later -- neither of which I was doing after the meal. ) The pizza was delicious -- crisp inside, fluffy and chewy crust, and plenty of toppings that ensure that I'd finish it off completely.  As it was one of the seasonal specials, I just had to order the strawberry shortcake and add ice cream to it -- and I will admit I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it was deliciously sweet and refreshing, and the ice cream was a nice touch. On the other, though, I wasn't much of a fan of the sweet biscuit that they used as the shortcake base. My preference is for the pound cake instead -- other than that, it was an enjoyable dessert.  Like I said, CPK is one of my favorite pizza chains in town, and the issues I had about the service and the dessert recipe aren't enough to keep me from returning in the future! Of all the dining options at Town Square, this and P.F. Chang's are among my favorites, and it's hard not to see why. Hopefully you like this place too if you decide to stop by while you're in Town Square!",

Ordering was smooth and no issues at all, but the time that I was given was way over an hour. Actually from the time that I placed the order it was 2.5 hours , but is was delivered to my house.   I ordered two pepperoni pizzas which were great and perfect. The crispy Mac and cheese bites were cold and reheating them in the microwave did not save them. The shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread was so very good and rich. The Asparagus salad was really good too. I ordered an order of Mexican street corn which was so perfect. The goat cheese made it. They did forget the street corn but I had within thirty minutes. And for dessert I ordered red velvet cake which was amazing and so perfect with the cream and sugar content. The strawberry shortcake looked like someone shook it up so I did not get to eat it. Aside from all of our food being shaken up it was good.",

Our hostess apologized and quickly had someone clean our table. Our waiter was very attentive and quick to get our drink/food orders. And our food tasted delicious! I always used to come to CPK often with my family when I was little. I'm glad they still have the Avocado Club Rolls, which are so savory and crunchy. The chipotle ranch sauces matches well with it. This was also my first time every trying the Thai Chicken Pizza and I don't know why I waited until now to try it! It's very good, no wonder it's a CPK favorite.",

My Roasted Garlic Chicken pizza was average (would've preferred a little more chicken and scallions, but the garlic was just right). Our waitress was attentive without hovering, polite and friendly without being robotic. The sangria flight was actually very tasty and had a bit of a kick. And 3-ounce pours was actually larger than I thought they'd be.  Patio seating: DON'T do it. Although it is nice to sit outside on a cool Sunday evening to eat dinner with your loved one, the constant sound of planes overhead on approach to McCarran is a bit of a mood killer. I guess you don't realize the close proximity that Town Center is to the airport until you have to yell across the table.",

You can't please everyone in this department so no stars taken off for this.   Our waitress was polite and efficient. Margareta pizza was delicious however there were dry spots missing cheese. Not enough cheese. A pizza restaurant that lacks cheese on it's pizza. Step it up folks.",

    "text": "I've been here like two or three times before and I never was disappointed with their service and food here. I came by around 6:30pm on Tuesday and got seated at a table really quick with my friend. Our server was super nice and friendly. I had saw on Yelp that if you signed up for their CPK Rewards, you can get a free small plate (btw that includes the flat breads as well). I asked him about the rewards and gave him my code from the app and ordered the Bianca Flat Bread. A few minutes later, he came back and said that my reward wasn't found and I told him it was strange since the reward shown I had to use it within 119 mins. He told me if I just signed up for the CPK Rewards, I can only use the \"small plate\" reward on my NEXT visit, not on the same day. Being so nice, he went to talk to his manager and both of them came back telling us they took care of it for us and we didn't need to pay for the flat bread. I thought that was very kind of them to do that, even though I had misunderstood the reward program. We of course, have him a good tip for the great gesture. The server definitely took the extra steps to accommodate for us and try to make us happy. Thank you.   Anyways, onto the food. Like I mentioned, the Bianca flatbread was so good!! Cheesy goodness! Very crispy and sufficient size for me and my friend to eat. Next was our BBQ Chicken salad, I order a half size. It was simple and the chicken to salad ratio wasn't the best. I was surprised how little of the BBQ chicken was given. Then we moved onto the Thai Chicken pizza on a cauliflower crust. Now this crust was interesting. I have tried some other cauliflower crusted pizzas before and CPK was kinda strange to me only because it tasted chewy. We thought we were eating a gluten-free crust. I'm not saying it was bad, it was good actually, but it was definitely interesting.   Lastly were our drinks. I am a big Moscow Mule fan and that's my go to cocktail drink and I liked this. I like my Moscow Mules with a lot of ginger beer and this had it! I got a Tropical Mule, their seasonal drink right now. In addition to the ginger beer, it had rum and passionfruit juice served in a cute copper pot. Also had some candied ginger and a small orange slice skewered on a toothpick. Really cute! My friend got the Hand Shaken Agave Mojito. It came with a small stick of sugar cane, so be sure to chew on it, it's sweet! He said he enjoyed the drink and both of ours were very refreshing.    Overall, like I said before I haven't been disappointed with this CPK at Town Square. :)",

The Thai Crunch Salad includes edamame, peanuts, rice sticks, wonton strips, and a terrific peanut dressing. By ordering the dinner portion and only eating half, I can take home the remainder with extra dressing. When added to lettuce, my leftovers can make 2-3 more meals.  They serve bread and olive oil automatically at each table. The bread is made fresh and very tasty (as is the olive oil).  Employees at this and other CPKs have always been very professional in their service to customers.  When traveling, CPK is a great place to pick up a to-go order to eat back in your hotel room. Call ahead and you'll be out the door in no time at all.",

The service was incredible and it was great to see all the staff work as a TEAM! :) Our food in turn came out just as delicious!!!  My mom got the Pesto Cream Penne which she said was not drowning in too much sauce and she pretty much devoured it all! I had the Fish Tacos w/ avacado which, by the way I can see why it is a CPK favorite! Just the right amount fish and it came with salsa and chips. Boy, that was mouth watering! We also enjoyed a couple of drinks along with our meals. To be specific mango mojito, strawberry mango cooler and a strawberry rhubarb martini and whoever the bartender is THANK YOU! Drinks were not over powering but tasted flavorful! We ended the meal with this amazing butter cake!!!! Off the chain....no joke its just the right amount of decadent w/ a hint of deadly ;)   Overall, such a great afternoon and the ability of the staff to work as a team and smiles all around really reflected upon the food which was beyond amazing :) We also got to meet the manager Haley who was super delightful! You have return customers for sure CPK!! :)",

(mushroom pizza) My BF liked his garlic chicken Pizza, I apparently was the only one who picked the bad pizza. The five cheese and tomato one was literary cheese on bread with tomatoes on it, I guess I figured there would be marinara sauce, I asked for some on the side and it was fine.  I'll come back for the other pizzas my advice would be don't waste your money on the five cheese \"pizza.\" We had Tyler as our server and he was really nice, engaged in conversation with us and even gave my mom a birthday sundae for free. He's a keeper, I would definitely come back just because of his amazing service.",

Al (the on duty FOH manager?) , suggested that I call about 15 minutes prior to arrival to put our party on a waiting list if necessary. This option proved not to be necessary. Once seated,  Alexia quickly took our drink order, and then our food order.  She was very efficient in bringing out,  then refilling,  our drinks, and bread and oil.  Our entrees came out quickly, too.  It didn't seem like we had to wait very long.  Al was also very helpful in other areas, for which I had sent a comment on the corporate website.",

The worst part wasn't even that wait, while eating my salad, I found a cockroach in the plate!!! The assistant manager told me that it was unfortunate but a reality for places using \"fresh\" produce. I felt that it was highly unprofessional that he would suggest that, or suggest that we order anything off the menu, as the last thing I'd want to eat is anything from that kitchen. I asked for corporates number multiple times and he just kept restating that he'd give us his business card and we could contact him if we needed anything. (We never got the number for corporate.) In the end we left with two gift cards for 15$ that will basically get you 1 pepperoni pizza. Nice to know that my business and health is worth $15. I will never return to this CPK again. 0/10, DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL.",

My review is of their new gulten free menu.  It is awesome! They have for pizzas to chose from: BBQ chicken, pepperoni, margherita, and mushroom pepperoni sausage. Right when you you walk and ask the hostess for a gf menu they know what you are talking about, which is nice. The waiters are also well trained and very familiar with the gluten free options. When ever you order gluten free the manager comes over and explains their process of avoiding cross contamination and then hand delivers the pizza to you.  The pizza are delicious and high quality. They use a different  gluten free crust, it is about 14 inches in diameter and tastes just like a regular thin crust pizza, or so my girlfriend  says.  Keep it up CPK! Thank for being serious about your gluten free options.",

The wait for food was pretty long and when it came it honestly wasn't anything too special. We ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and the california club. They didn't taste too bad, but they were very average.  The portions are a little bigger than the norms so you'll end up with some take home :D  Overall nothing too bad about this place and nothing too spectacular.",

I was trying to try something new that I could have for dinner and lunch the next day and I got the garlic cream fettuccine and it was a great choice! It was a big portion of pasta and the sauce with a little cheese on top was perfect. My boyfriend has the Shanghai bowl and added Salmon and said it was delicious.

The Works Pizza:  Spicy Italian sausage, rustic pepperoni, Cremini mushrooms, Mozzarella, red onions, green peppers, olives and wild Greek oregano.  This was good, but that spicy Italian sausage REALLY is spicy, so be careful.  For drinks we both had \"Spiked Cucumbers\", which is a gin drink.  These were excellent.

We sat at the bar, which was completely open, and was served quickly. We both got the strawberry lime margarita, which was actually very good it was the best part of the visit.  We chose to share the California Club Pizza and the Avocado Eggrolls. Eggrolls came with two sauces, like a chive ranch and a southwest ranch maybe? I thought they were pretty good but my friend wasn't a fan. The pizza had bacon, chicken, one tomato slice, an avocado slice, and topped with arugula. The pizza was just dry tasting - the bacon and chicken seemed too much and both were dry as well. I tried adding the Eggrolls ranch to the pizza and it didn't help. The arugula was way over powering on the pizza also so we both ended up just taking it off...   Overall not super impressed, the salads everyone had looked great so I'd try that next time. 2 stars for the food and an extra star for the server/bartender - he gave us a free margarita to share because another party changed their mind on what they wanted to drink. Maybe I'll return, but there's so many other options in Town Square I'd probably check someplace else out first.",

They were fried nice and crispy without it being oily. The dipping sauce was very good as well.   The California Cobb salad was good. Not great but good. I like the spin on it with the garbanzo beans but it didn't have a wow factor of any kind but then again, it's a salad.   Now the shrimp scampi zucchini..... I truly wanted to enjoy this but I just couldn't. The noodles were way over cooked and although I'm not certain what is used to make the sauce, oil is definitely the MAIN ingredient. That is all you tasted. It was by far one of the grossest things I tried and wanted to like.   Guess I'll stick to appetizers....",

I also love their pizzas here. I usually get the bbq chicken or their pepperoni/sausage and mushroom. Overall its a great lunch or dinner spot. I wish they had some sort of reward program. If they do I'm unaware, but I've never had any complaints here, staff is real friendly! Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've been here many times, since Town Square first opened. They used to be pretty good, but the past few times I've been here the food has been nothing but inconsistent. We always order the same thing: spicy buffalo cauliflower and Thai crunch salad with extra dressing on the side, no cilantro.   Went there today for lunch and ordered the usual. Got our iced water with no straws, server was no where to be found so we grabbed our own straws. The salad and cauliflower came at the same time. She didn't provide us serving spoons for the salad nor did she bring us spoons for the dressing. We had to get another server's attention for spoons because she paid no attention to us while attending other tables. After waiting awhile, we still didn't get our spoons and finally were able to get our server's attention. Then still waited a few minutes and the other server finally brought us spoons. Probably took about 5-10 minutes just to get spoons.   The Thai crunch salad had always been served with crispy cabbages from my experiences. However, the last 2 times I've visited they served us with lettuce, which in my opinion really changes the taste of the salad and defeats the \"crunch\" description of the salad. The menu says \"crisp veggies\" so I can't really argue it has to be cabbages but I've never had it with lettuce until the last 2 recent visits.The last time we came, I asked the server and he said they ran out of cabbages. Not sure why they didn't ask if we were okay with lettuce. Sounds like they just slap on whatever veggies they have that day? Very inconsistent. And today, it came with lettuce again.   Halfway through eating we noticed a bunch of cucumber skins in the salad. Looks like they peeled them and left them in there. Some pieces were also not peeled all the way. The cauliflower this time also didn't taste the same as before, it contained less sauce and tasted a little more bland.   Won't be coming back to this location. I recommend the one at fashion show mall, they're consistent and I never experience slow service there.",

    "text": "I had visited CPK many years ago but never in Nevada, so I decided to try out their lunch. I remember not being impressed when I first visited many years ago, but decided to give it another try since so much time had passed.   I went along with one other person and we arrived when they opened around 11am. The restaurant was pretty much empty and we were seated right away. My first impression was not a good one. We were seated in a booth, and the seats were filthy. It looked like no one wiped them down and they were sprinkled with pizza crumbs.   We were handed the menus and while we were trying to discuss the menu options and what we would share, so we could try a variety of items, we had to lean forward to speak because the music was so loud. When I go to a restaurant, I like to be able to speak to the people I go with. I'm not there to watch the sports on their TV or scroll through social media on my phone. This location completely ruined that portion of the dining experience.   We ordered the small plate of Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese. They were four deep fried macaroni and cheese balls sitting atop some cheese sauce. The macaroni was undercooked. There was absolutely no cheese flavor. It was dry and flavorless, like a ball of fried panko bread crumbs with no seasoning. The cheese sauce was far from creamy- it was watery and did nothing to improve the flavor.   We both ordered their lunch duos. I special ordered a 7 inch shrimp scampi pizza with a tomato basil bisque soup, and they ordered a mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza with the baked potato soup.   Both pizzas, although very different, were similarly horrible. The presentation for the pizzas is deceiving because they both look amazing, but the flavor is just not there. My shrimp scampi pizza was dry, and the arugula on top just made it worse. I tasted no Parmesan, mozzarella, or red chili. Just unseasoned shrimp and chunks of limp onion with arugula. I also got to sample the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza. The first bite was incredibly unpleasant- it was overly seasoned with oregano to the point that you could not taste anything else.  The only pleasant part of the meal were the soups. The tomato basil bisque had a good level of acidity and creaminess. The baked potato soup had very tender potatoes and was well seasoned. There was just enough bacon and green onions and it all came together wonderfully.  When I go to a place with \"pizza\" in the name, I expect the best part of the meal to be the pizzas. If I had known that the only good part was going to be the soups, I would have just ordered a soup and salad and steered clear of the pizza. The meals were not worth the money and we left very disappointed. 2/5 stars, only because the soups were good.",

    "text": "CPK is a chain, but it's always been one of our favorite eateries.   Inside the decor is an upscale casual with servers wearing jeans and black shirts. They have a good mix of booths and tables for seating as well as a large bar.   They don't take reservations, but you can go on the Opentable app or website to get on the seating waitlist ahead of time sort of like call ahead seating.   Join their free pizza dough rewards program, and you will earn points toward rewards with each purchase. You'll also get occasional promotions which are usually good deals.   Service is typically good, but of course it can be hit or miss.   For appetizers I recommend the avocado club egg rolls. Crispy egg rolls full of bacon, chicken, cheese, and avocado. Delicious and crispy though not too oily or greasy (they are fried, though). For pizzas you can't go wrong wrong with the Thai chicken pizza. Bean sprouts, chicken, and a peanut sauce. Excellent! The Hawaiian is also a great choice. Also recommended is the spaghetti bolognese. Perfectly cooked pasta and rich meat sauce. When you're ready for dessert try their tart key lime pie which never disappoints. The salted caramel pudding served in a jar is a newer and also good choice. Overall the food here has always been very good.   CPK is not cheap, though. In particular their desserts are pricey - $7 to $8 each plus $2 if you want ice cream. A bit inflated, yes. A couple will easily spend $50-$60 here without alcohol.   A bit pricey, but it's always a tasty meal at CPK.",

We don't go as often as we used to but came here because they sent us a coupon for a free dessert, lol, for my husband's birthday.   We usually get sat in a big, comfortable booth.  They have \"small bites\" appetizers and we tried the mediterranean focaccia bread.  It's really delicious but they don't give enough of the dipping oil, which would be my only complaint about it.    My husband is disappointed because they got rid of his favorite pizza, the bacon cheeseburger pie.  But he really loves their bolognese sauce and always enjoys his pasta dishes.    The waiter kept our glasses full all dinner long, which is something of a lost art in these parts, haha.   The dessert is the real kicker.  All of their desserts are purely gluttonous and amazing.  We've tried almost all of them but the hidden gem is the butter cake!  How could something so simple be so good?!?  And it's a thousand times better if you get it a la mode.  It's so soft and light it literally melts in your mouth.   Of course my other complaint is that I always leave here feeling like a cow because of how much I ate.  But at least I'm not going hungry!   If you haven't had this for a while I think you should definitely rediscover it because the service and the food are pretty awesome for a chain restaurant!",

My friend started with the wedge salad on the small plates menu. I could see the water dripping off of the lettuce and all the ingredients appeared to be thrown on the plate. Not a good value for almost $6. Next came our entrees, the oriental chicken salad and Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza. Once again, both dishes did not appear thoughtfully made. My salad contained iceberg lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and chicken the only substantial ingredient. The salad was exactly like a mix from the grocery store. The dressing was fine although a little heavy for the ingredients in the salad. My friend was also underwhelmed with her pizza. Her pizza was soaked in BBQ sauce, it was undercooked, and you could tell the quality of the mozzarella was low by the plastic like texture.   CPK I waited years to give you another try to see if the quality and thoughtfulness of your dishes had improved but I see the price of your food is still too high for the ambiance, quality, and plating of your dishes.",

I usually try to avoid this restaurant unless it's the one in downtown summerlin. Well I had no choice this last time. I met up with some friends and they all voted for CPK. I tried to stay positive and go with the flow. We go in and are told it'll be at least twenty five minutes. Since there isn't much space to wait and we all had our kids, we decided to go to the Disney art store for a bit.         Once we returned we were automatically seated. The waitress seemed friendly and greeted us within a few minutes, but ordering food and drinks is where the problem came in. She took our drink order and after ten minutes they finally arrived (one alcoholic beverage and three waters). She then comes to take our order and we request if she'll return in one minute. Ten minutes later she returns again. So my friends all order pizza and I order the chicken tequila pasta. Close to 30 minutes later a server brings out the pizza and asked if I ordered anything. I told him I ordered the pasta and all of a sudden he looked really nervous. I was pretty hungry and trying not to over react (I take my food very seriously, it's not that hard to get an order right). The waitress came to us and admitted that my meal was sent to the wrong take and the person at the table already started eating it. She apologized and said she put another order in. When the my pasta came out she was genuinely apologetic. By the end of the meal, she said she took my meal of the tab. I really appreciate restaurants that make mistakes and own up to it, not just make a pathetic excuse and just say sorry. My problem is that this location always messes something up when I come in. Maybe I have a stamp on my head that says \"mess up his order\" or maybe their job is really that hard? The one think I do know, I'll probably not be returning to this location. The end.",

I informed Brad the Manger of the place that I am pregnant, and he did not feel any need to follow up with a client that he potentially made ill.  Congratulations on your filthy establishment and terrible customer service.  The photo and story have already hit social media, as we do not want you to harm anyone else.

    "text": "California Pizza Chicken... in Nevada!!   (get your own pizza chicken  ....)  Went here for my cousins graduation dinner with a party of about 17, and we all ended up sitting outside in the patio, SEPARATELY. It would have been nicer if they could have seated all of us at one big table formed by many little ones, instead separating the whole family. ;(  I ended up sitting with my dad and uncle, both who ordered fish tacos while I ordered the wild mushroom pizza. All which came with complimentary bread and oil. Let me cut to the chase:  - WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA I was very disappointed after trying this pizza. The crust may have been perfectly soft, but for 13.99? I don't think so. It was not even that good.  - FISH TACOS I stole one of my dad's fish taco's and thought they were bomb. The two avocado slices helped finish me off into oblivion. However, the tortilla and fish was a little to dry for me.  - BREAD AND OIL All though these were complimentary, I actually enjoyed eating these more than the pizza and tacos. The bread might have been a little too hard on the outside, but it was so dam soft on the inside. Combined with the oil, I would have been fine just eating this instead of the main dishes!!  - SERVICE I think something was wrong with our server.. She told me that my pizza will be out \"shortly\". I soon realized she said that 20 minutes ago. 20 minutes is not short!!!!  My uncle also asked for a refill for his beer, which ended up taking 10 minutes to refill -_-. She didn't even apologize!!",

    "text": "After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT!  So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste.  The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy.  Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely.  But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana.  One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin.  Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!",

After sitting down in the waiting area two separate couples also checked in after us.  Well one couple, who came in after us, was escorted to a booth. I thought perhaps they called in for reservations and no big deal. Then after an additional longer wait the second couple was escorted to a booth. I couldn't believe it so I went up to the hostess and asked what was going on?  She could only say she was sorry and it would be just a few minutes longer as they cleaned a booth.  I advised that I would like to speak with the manager after we get seated. The two of us was seated in a booth big enough to sit eight.  Unreal!  When the manager arrived I explained what occurred, and she was apologetic. I pointed out that families were waiting in the sitting area and we could not take this large booth while they waited as it wasn't right. I explained that we would just leave so she offered a rain check.  We refused the rain check and departed.  I can only say hospitality starts at the front door, and should extend throughout the establishment, but we didn't really feel it inside, and we do have choices where we wish to spend our money.  California Kitchen was one of our first choices but won't be a choice in the future.",

Generally I don't like to spend too much money on lunch (cause day after day, that adds up quickly), but I was craving some four cheese pasta. A friend said she thinks CPK had it, so we went there.  It was busy, and staff was friendly. We got seated after a few minute wait, and our server was nice and generally pretty efficient. I ordered the four cheese ravioli even though it was a bit more than I wanted to spend (like 14 bucks I believe).   It was pretty \"meh.\" It really wasn't that cheesy, and for four cheeses being in there, I would have thought there would be more flavor. It was bland, the sauce with it was just alright, and all together I was disappointed in the meal.   I haven't tried this location before, but I have also never tried the ravioli at CPK. Maybe it's just not a good dish there.",

After our last meal, will be a while before we return.  Service was quite slow, as took quite a while to get the drinks out, and we had to find the server to get refills.  The pizza had very little taste.  Not sure if the crust was overcooked, or just little taste.  Pizza also took forever to come out.  Considering the premium price of their pizzas, I just can't see returning unless we start hearing some positives.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this CPK ever since it first opened, which was when Town Square first opened. Granted, I don't go THAT often but on and off -- usually with friends or family. I typically prefer this location over the one at Fashion Show Mall only because I hate venturing towards the direction of the strip. Not only that but this location is bigger.   However, I don't have a single memory of exceptional service from this establishment. Not once in the amount of odd years it's been around. In fact, I remember one time, when I went with friends, no one came to our table for a LONG while (not even for drink orders) so what did we do? Build a fort out of the menus. I know, we were so immature but funny thing was, that didn't get their attention.   I just recently came back to dine at this establishment with my family after being away from Las Vegas for three years, and I gotta say... the service certainly hasn't improved. I gotta admit, it's not as busy as it used to be, but it still took a LONG while for any server to acknowledge our existence after we got seated. There was nothing wrong with the hostess, but there was something wrong with the waitresses. I think it took so long that ANOTHER waitress that wasn't OUR waitress came to take our orders because no one else helped us. Which caused a little confusion later on when the food arrived.   Other than that, everything else went fine. After we got our food, we were happy campers.   Speaking of the food, it is pretty on point. It's pretty good. One of my favorite is their bolognese pasta. Sometimes I like to ask for them to make it spicy, in which they add pepper flakes to the pasta. Always turns out yummy. The garlic cream fettuccine is also another favorite of mine but sometimes, the flavor can be so-so. Oh, their tiramisu never disappoints either :)   Not a bad place. Not a fabulous place. Still great to eat at with family and friends when you want some CPK. Gotta have patience though.",

    "text": "I haven't written a Yelp review before, but unfortunately, my last two visits to this CPK have been so bad that I felt the need to post this review.  The first time we went (1/21/17), we had an okay experience. The food was good overall, though there were a few things that were off: the bread was stale, our food came with toppings we specifically requested removed, and the raspberry iced tea was mostly too-sweet raspberry flavoring with a pinch of tea. The service was also a bit slow, but we enjoyed our time there. So, using a gift card I had been given, I tipped just under 10% -- leaving the balance exactly $11.  Today (4/2/17) we went again, and it was a great expereience. The food, drinks and service were fantastic, and we were very happy during our time there. The problem came when we went to pay the bill. I still had my original receipt from my old gift card, which showed it should have had $11 left. However, when we went to pay, it the balance was only $8. I was shocked, and then, disturbed to realize that the server from our first experience--who turned out to be our same server today, Chad--had clearly tipped himself an extra $3 when he ran our card back in January.  I didn't want to cause a scene and call him out--we had a fine time there today, after all--but that kind of behavior is inexcuseable. Since our server took the liberty of tipping himself extra last time, we left without leaving a tip. We love CPK-- but hate that our date was turned sour by staff's shady behavior. Safe to say, we sadly won't be returning to this location again.",

The pizza came in a to-go carrier with handles that was very convenient. I ordered the \"Untraditional Cheese Pizza\" priced at $9.75 that was cheesy and good. Most pizzas with more than one cheese have a smokey type of cheese on it and this one didn't, which I loved. Simple and good!   You can place your pick-up order over the phone or online.

    "text": "While I have eaten at this location and it is fine (yes, kind of loud and lots of kids), my review is for CPK in general.  I agree it is a little pricey for what you get, so we only go very infrequently.    One of my biggest peeves is restaurants that do not have a cravable dish.  Well, I love, love, love the waldorf chicken salad and the chicken tostada pizza (with the original crust, they changed it to flat bread, do not order it this way).   As for cpk in general, they can very few and far between have the chain syndrome of off food or staffing, their soda (also like many chains places is horrible) and their \"free\" bread, that oddly is only served sometimes, is also dry and tasteless, so I am glad that more than not it is not presented because i love bread and don't want to bother eating it.    We have rarely gotten other menu items, when with larger groups we order other random ones and enjoy them....the blt, the buffalo chicken (I think this is gone too) come to mind.  They took my husbands favorite of the sweet sausage and onion off the menu.  That also seems to be a problem for chains....when something works don't change it.....put the tostada pizza back on the original crust or people might not know how good it is.",

I've been going to various Cpks in the past and even though their menu has changed and portions got smaller is time I must say that yesterday was one of the best times yet! Kevin, our server was awesome. Very kind, polite, and informative about the menu! Wish they had more Kevin's out there. Food came out quick and Kevin checked up on us time to time. Let me tell you, not once had we had to ask for anything because he was on top of it! Very much appreciate that!!",

    "text": "I visited the newly remodeled Town Square location on Saturday (11/21) around 11:45am. We asked to sit outside because it was a nice cool afternoon. They sat us and from that point on it was as if we didn't exist. I order what I've been ordering for the last 15 years, the full size BBQ chicken salad. Since I always order that, I know what the portion is supposed to look like. The price has increased and the salad has shrunk. The full size is now comparable to what the half size used to be. I was very disappointed. How do you justify higher price for less food? When they dropped off my salad I asked the guy for a side of ranch. He said \"sure\" and that was the last I saw of him. I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come check on me outside so I can ask again. Finally, I had to leave my table and go inside the restaurant to ask a random cashier to get me a side of ranch. By this time, my salad was old, undersized, and just tasted wrong. Perhaps the whole experience is what put a bad taste in my mouth, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. Flagging down a waitress to address my issue was the ongoing challenge of the day (it wasn't busy). My friend that was dining with me literally stood up and waived her arms in the air from side to side to get someone's attention. That didn't work either. She was frustrated for me, and this was holding us up because she was already done eating. She went inside the restaurant and grabbed what seemed to be the manager. I didn't go into all of my issues because I didn't have the patience. I told them the salad that I always get didn't taste right and I just want them to prepare me the Garlic Cream Fettuccine and pack it TO GO since this has been a long drawn out ordeal. I felt like the manager was trying to upsell when he tried to push the grilled chicken option on me. I said \"my chicken experience hasn't been good today so I'll pass\". He pushed it on me more and I agreed to it just to get it done. I was told the salad would be taken off my bill. I thought to myself \"that's a given, the salad wasn't made well, basically untouched and I'm sending it back\"... When I got the bill, they offered no discount for my inconvenience, no free dessert, nothing. I'm just very put off by this experience. I hate that I'm going to have to stop coming to a place that I so often visit.",

Not this time.    We walked in, sat down and were so thrilled and happy because my fiance and I had just gotten engaged.  Don't get me wrong- I don't put a price tag on food, so we could have chosen to eat anywhere fancy shmancy to celebrate our recent engagement. But what did lil' ol' me want to do??  I wanted a damn pizza from CPK!  Why? Because it was a refeed day from weeks of lifting and underfeeding (fitness/training talk) and like I said- it's my favorite restaurant, and I am ALWAYS happy when I go to and leave any CPK.  Our waiter walked over with a quietly foul, non-chalant, I don't give a sh*t attitude.  Totally killed our mood, but hey- I was okay with it because I just wanted my pizza.  Thai Pizza to be exact.  Edgar ordered fried mac & cheese, and I ordered hummus.  Pita was dry and lacked texture.  Mac & Cheese was dry.  Bleh.  My pizza was abysmal.  I've ordered this pizza dozens of times, and I was so disappointed.  But oh well, it is what it is. It was dry and lacked that peanuty flavor that it normally has.  It was just...just.  That's it.  Nothing more to it.  And Edgar's Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza was thin.  We didn't order thin.   I would give this visit a darn 1, but I'll leave it at 3 because I really do love the restaurant chain.  And if you know me-- I don't take to chains too much.    We'll definitely be back because I know it was an anamoly.",

The avocado didn't come out with it, but the server brought it out on the side. It still looked amazing, however it lacked so much flavor. It tasted as though the veggies were frozen, thawed, and then baked on pizza left with no nutrient or flavor. Not even the red pepper flakes helped my case.

And we've been here plenty of times.   We ordered fire grilled rib eye, bianco, and chicken tequila fettuccini. The fettuccini with rib eye combo compliments eachother really well. The waiter name is Kyle and he recommended all to us. Let me tell you, this is the FIRST TIME that a waiter asked me \"hows the food\" and I respond with \"amazing.\"   Everything just went great with eachother. The sage on the bianco brought great flavors, the citric taste from the tequila fettuccini together with the rib eye, mannnn. I use to find this place mediocre.   On top of this, great service. Server came by many times to check up on us. He even made us laugh a few times. Man 5/5 !  :) would come again only on days when this server is working LOL",

The servers and hosts were polite. The food was good but still over-priced relative to the portion and taste. The reason CPK will earn my return patronage is because the the manager, Jamie.  I tried to use a $25 gift card I received about seven months prior to my visit. The card was declined and showed a zero balance. We paid the remaining balance in cash which was not a problem. An hour later I contacted my aunt who had gifted me the card. She requested I retrieve the card so she can dispute the balance. When I returned the get the card it had already been thrown away. Jamie was extremely apologetic and she immediately gave me a $30 credit for my next visit. I am extremely impressed with the way the situation was handled. Jamie sympathized with me and accommodated the situation professionally. We will be returning.",

    "text": "Have been to different CPKs all around town, food is delicious as always. But the service here was terrible!!   First of, there was a wait which was fine, however I saw two people came in after most of us but were seated before us, they were seated right away. I heard the host asked them \"Did you want to eat here?\" then seated them right away. I don't know what is the whole story with that but even another party looked around like \"Why are they getting a table right away?!\"   After we were seated the server came up to us immediately and asked for our orders. Everything was find with drink orders and food orders. He told us about the new items and was friendly enough. Our apps came pretty quickly which was nice, when the main courses came, I picked up our empty appetizers plates with the intention of giving the dishes to the food runner because we had no space left on our table, she put the food down on the table and walked away in a rush when I know for a fact that she saw me holding the dirty plates! The plates were huge and the runner was standing right next to me, there was no way that she did not see I was holding the plates, but she just walked away without the picking up the dirty plates. So we stacked the dirty plates to one side ate with very little space, the server eventually came to take the plates away, did not ask us if we needed anything else or how the food was. He did not check in with us at all until it was time for the check.   I have been to this particular CPK a few times before and service was find, but this time it was strange. Maybe they got new employees and needed more training.",

We were too full to even order any dessert, but we recommend the BUTTER CAKE any day.   Only reason I give a 4 star today is because during my visit today, the I ordered the Thai crunch without chicken, and the plate came back with chicken.

Pizza sounded good to us, so we ended up here at CPK.   Our hostess was good about getting our drinks started right away. She answered all of our questions in a prompt and friendly manner. She was also really attentive about refilling our drinks.  We ordered a pizza, half California Club, and half the Works. Please keep in mind that these pizzas are medium-sized, so you get 6 slices total. My husband had the Works: a take on supreme pizza. He liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. I had the California Club and I cannot express in words how good it was! It comes with bacon, cheese, romaine tossed in lemon pepper mayonnaise, and it is topped with avocado. The avocado and romaine were super fresh and the lemon pepper mayonnaise was the bomb! I liked it so much that as soon as I got home from the restaurant, I searched for a recipe for it with no avail, unfortunately. Hahaha.   Great service and good food. I'll be back if I find myself in the area again.",

We both started out with drinks and the chicken lettuce wrap appetizers. When I tell y'all I ALWAYS get this appetizer, I'm not kidding. It's something light, tangy, crunchy and something I look forward to ordering when I come here. For dinner, my friend and I both shared the Wild Mushroom Pizza. If you are a mushroom lover, this pizza is def for you. Thin crust, wonderful cheese ratio and the meatiness from the different mushrooms really make this pizza. We decided to get dessert and ordered the chocolate cake (sorry I can't remember the full name!!) with ice cream. It's really chocolaty, so if you don't mind that, this dessert is perfect for you",

They handle our food and drinks with care, and they also entertain us. Whether it's with small talk or jokes, they know how to do their job right. They even hold the door open for you when exiting! One of the things I really love about CPK are their happy hours. You can get yourself a rich cup of wine or a strong beer to sip on with your food. The food is beyond words! Each bite is a flavorful explosion in your mouth. I recommend the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower as a small plate, the Avocado Club Egg Rolls or Spinach Artichoke Dip for an appetizer, and some type of savory pasta or hearty salad for an entree. The Chicken Piccata is absolutely mouthwatering, but the Roasted Veggie Salad is brilliant. You can even get shrimp, a slice of chicken, or a fillet of salmon for a little extra money on your salad! Lastly is the dessert. If you have the chance to order some dessert at CPK, then I highly advise you to. The Butter Cake and Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake are life-changing! You will not regret getting them. Also, their sundaes are simple but bring back some childhood memories. You may want to step out of your comfort zone and get a festive dessert for the season. If so, get the Pumpkin Cheesecake. It's creamy and just right!",

I took a friend, he really enjoyed his  being that he's Vegan. It's kinda hard to find good places that are good to eat and the ambiance is inviting. This was his first time ever eating here, and he to really enjoyed himself. Nicole our server was very pleasant and vibrant. Our hostess was also very hospitable. The General Manager, was very attentive to everyone's satisfaction of everything. When the couple came in with a Golden Retriever that's when things started looking like the stars were gonna change to a lower amount. But I know it was absolutely too cold for the dog to be left in the car. They could've also ordered or been recommended to order Take Out. It's a different time and a lot of people really don't respect how other's would see that a animal in a restaurant not being a service animal sitting on the booth seats would be kinda unsanitary and unorthodox. Overall I Love pets, and there human as well in my eyes. I'll definitely go here again.  Thanks again Nicole for your great service.",

There was not much avocados in it but lots of corn. It tasted good but not what I expected.  We had the Butter cake. It was a bit sweet for me but I could still appreciate it as quality dessert. I would come back and would recommend it to my friends.",

Not worth 20 bucks a plate  for some stuff u can make at home . Never coming back again. If u have good patience, eat here and make sure u bring a couple books cuz my god they take long to do anything. I work at a pizza place and let me tell u it's not hard to make this shit.",

The service at the pizza counter was not the best, I had two different servers asking me questions and checking on me but I never really knew who my server was...  Whenever I asked for something, bread, balsamic, ranch, it always took a while for them to return with it.  The food was DELICIOUS. I had the bbq pizza with a cease salad lunch special and my daughter had the macaroni and cheese which was SO good. Will definitely be returning , but I recommend avoiding the pizza counter at all costs to get better service",

Server jumped to the table and start to talk very loudly what kind of fun I've done today, I said nothing much, give me a minute to decide what do I want to order. But he was keep talking about my day and it was extremely annoying. Later on my friend asked for a straw, he threw it to the table and laughed. I guess it supposed to be funny?!!! His attitude was awful. After the dinner I ordered dessert. Wait time was 20 minutes and they bring me a large soup spoon.",

    "text": "I think the last time I went to a California Pizza Kitchen was at least 4 years ago in Michigan! Surprisingly I haven't gone to the one in Town Square, however, that changed today. One of my girlfriends wanted to catch up with a light lunch and recommended we go here.  We shared the Tortilla Spring Rolls as an app - you can choose from 3 different kinds and we got the Mediterranean Veggie and the Thai Chicken (Baja Chicken is the third choice). Three small portions of each came out with a marinara sauce for the veggie and a sweet peanut sauce for the thai spring rolls. They were both pretty tasty and a great way to start our lunch.   I wanted a salad and went with the half portion of the Waldorf Chicken Salad and my friend got the half portion of the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The half portions are humongous and look like a full portion to me. Perfect size for lunch. My salad was incredibly delicious! Mixed greens with grapes, green apples, celery, chicken, candied walnuts, crumbled Gorgonzola, pre-tossed in a light vinaigrette. I wouldn't recommend getting this salad if you don't like Gorgonzola because as you know, it has a strong distinct taste and can be overpowering in any dish. I didn't mind at all because I LOVE cheese and Gorgonzola.   Katie was our server and she was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us quite often to make sure we were enjoying everything and to refill our drinks.  I'm very satisfied with my lunch today and would gladly go back! Highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen if you're in Town Square and craving a fresh salad. I'll have to try their pizza next time.",

The food is always good, the service is decent, we never really have too much to complain about but my gosh, this location really knows what they're doing.   As soon as we walked in, Jesse politely greeted us & thanked us for coming in to dine with them. I literally felt like I just showed up to his house for dinner, he was so nice. Turns out, he was the GM so that explained his great service. He probably services as an elite example for his staff. We were asked our seating preference and we chose a booth in the bar area.   Our server DeMond really made our experience even better. He was personable and prompt. When we ordered, we went with his suggestion. The Pesto Cream Penne Pasta had great flavor and it was a generous portion of food. We also ordered the California Club pizza & a Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler. The California Club was a unique take on pizza. It came with Arugula tossed salad & fresh avocados on top. My fiance literally joked, \"did you order a salad??\". While the presentation was intimidating, the blend of ingredients was genius. We enjoyed everything but what made our experience exemplary was the service we received tonight.   Definitely recommend!",

She was very good, came by often and brought refills without asking.  I had the PEAR + GORGONZOLA pizza - Bosc pears, sweet caramelized onions and hazelnuts, topped with chilled field greens in housemade Gorgonzola ranch. Always my favorite.  Good as ever.   Mom had the PEPPERONI pizza - A combination of rustic and spicy pepperoni with fresh Mozzarella and wild Greek oregano. Always her favorite too.  My uncle had the KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI.  It looked tasty but spicy. Lots of hot peppers.    CPK is pretty similar no matter what location you go to.  This one was no exception.  Good food and service.",

    "text": "This pizza was probably the best pizza I've ate out here in Vegas so far! No too greasy. Not sloppy. But not dry neither. It was thin. But not to where it won't fill you up. It still fills you up. I really loved the pizza. It's very close to tasting like the good old pizza back from my home town Fresno in California. They also have one of those pizza places in L.A. and it's the last remaining one that's still it's classic old look. And the pizza taste better there than it did in Bakersfield. It's probably the only best pizza place there in L.A. all I've ever been to in L.A. was just sloppy thin pizza that's greasy. The pizzas place is called Me-N-Ed's pizzeria. And I'll 96% guarantee you'll love it. If you try it with their ranch that you'll have to pay for 50 for two I believe. It'll make you love the pizza even more and you will keep craving that pizza. But this is a review for California Kitchen Pizza. And it'll stay that way lol! The pizza from here was amazing in my opinion! Thinking of it is making hungry right now... I guess I'll stop by there again. And this is my very first time eating here too. Looking forward to going here every other week. Oh! And don't forget to put their parmesan on your pizza. IT'S TO DIE FOR!!",

We got sat down and we ordered our lunch I believe Juan was our server. We asked for ice water with lemon and he didn't bring it until we had to ask for it the second time. My friend ordered her pizza without red onions and he forgot to note that down because her pizza came out with red onions. I also ordered the Mediterranean salad with my meal but somehow it was Caesar so he had to switch it out. I also found a small piece of hair in my salad and took it out but I didn't complain about it. The pizzas we all ordered was really good. The appetizers plate that are set at each table before you sat down, one of them was dirty so we didn't use any of the plates that was already there. Our server probably only checked on us once throughout our whole meal. I would definitely recommend they work on better customer service. I gave this place 2 stars for lack of service we got but the food was delicious as it should be. I would like to give this location another try but I like the California pizza on the strip better.",

I don't know how you can leave a restaurant open when it's over 100 degrees outside and your a/c don't work. A warning would have been nice.

My boyfriend knows the usual, we start off with the avocado egg rolls (anything with bacon is amazing), Thai crunch salad gives a good balance to what we share, and the chefs make the best jambalaya (crawfish included yum!). We get the spicy buffalo chicken or meat lovers pizza when we're feeling hungry&bold. These plates are pretty big and perfect to share, especially when you're with your love ones (limit to one plate, BORING!). I recommend signing up for the CPK rewards point system, rack up points even  if you don't come often, get free treats or small plates.",

I ordered the pear and Gorgonzola pizza, which I have ordered before.  It was delicious as usual.  We did have a few drinks and they were good as well.  We did not have room for dessert, but they had some delicious choices.  The new bar area looks really nice and our service was good.  We will go back!",

The waiter was extremely nice and patient with us which I really appreciate because I know with so many of us in one group we were really loud and needy haha. He constantly kept our waters filled and our bread coming. The free bread they give there with a side of butter and dipping oil they serve is so good he served us three rounds! Overall the service was great and the food was even better. I've only tried the Hawaiian pizza and the Habanero carnitas pizza but from the quality of both I am looking to trying out the rest of their menu. My favorite is the habanero carnitas and I've been craving it ever since. I am in love haha",

    "text": "This was the first time visiting this location. I went at around 3pm with a friend. It was pretty slow inside. Not many people at tables. The place was very clean and the employees I seen were tiding up the place and helping customers. Our waiter was Miguel and he was very nice. He brought our drinks and bread quick and took our order which was just a pizza. The food was brought to our table in a matter of minutes. The bbq chicken pizza was excellent. Miguel checked in several times to make sure we had everything, drinks refilled, and that our food was ok. After the service and quality of food was excellent, I will come back.",

If you have a dog or somebody with a dog a dog is coming just remember the restaurants now at least this one wont allow pets inside the gate only on the outside. But I ordered pasta and my friend she ordered salad and we both loved it. Very nice place to be and hang out so I advise you to try it.",

We shared the chicken quesadilla appetizer while she had the BBQ chicken salad with avocado and I had the Bianco Flat bread with extra mushroom. All of the food was very yummy and served in pleasing portions. I also tried the agave mojito which was very refreshing after walking in from triple digit heat. The waiter was prompt and polite. I would recommend.",

    "text": "This location is generally pretty good. Although the other day I had the worst experience. We were seated very quickly but after that it took forever for everything.   It took a while for the waitress (Ariel) to come take our drink order, but thankfully once we ordered them it didn't take too long for them to come out. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. They are normally very good, but this time they were barely warm. The food runner who brought them out actually stopped in the middle of the restaurant to text for a minute and then brought our egg rolls. Extremely unprofessional. I was a little irked that our waitress offered all her other tables bread, but not ours. Since we had ordered an appetizer I wasn't too upset, but the inconsistency in the service was irritating. I order pasta for my daughter, which was also barely warm by the time we got it. The barbecue chicken salad we got was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. And then it took forever to get our check. Apparently texting and talking to other waiters was more important to our waitress than attending to her tables. I understand it was a slow time in the restaurant (a Tuesday around 4 pm) but still try to be somewhat attentive.   Overall, the experience was bad and I don't think I will be coming back to this location. There are plenty of other restaurant options in town square.",

    "text": "Being on a pizza kick, we are looking for high quality pizza around the valley. The pizza at cpk is about the same quality as some of the other high end chains. The problem here was the service. Unfortunately, our pizza s came out wrong (I had the BBQ chicken with no cheese and hubby the meat cravers, regular.) they reversed the order and his got no cheese. After we flagged down the server, sge apologized and sent them back. Unfortunately, again, she could not keep our drinks full. At one point, I waited so long for a refill, my pizza got cold waiting for a drink. Hubby had to eat  the second half of pizza with nothing to wash it down. His refill never came until after he was done. Very disappointing :(",

We got there during the lunch rush and there was a 10 min wait. That was all fine. When my name was called the host said is outside ok? It was a bit cold in the shade and windy so I asked to be inside. She responded with \"well outside is all that's available! You'll have to wait another 15!\" She wasn't to pleasant about us wanting to sit inside. I really dislike when hosts act like that at a restaurant. My server was very sweet and friendly. Food was good as usual. My experience was great other then the host with a serious attitude. Don't worry, I'll still be back.",

For the money this is not a good bargain place to eat.  Ordered a pasta dish and added chicken.  Very little chicken and very little sauce on the pasta as well.  There was probably only 3 or 4 oz of meat in the pasta for which they charged extra for.  They continually remove favorite items from the menu and now on this last visit I was told no more Tiramisu for desert starting next month.    Another Las Vegas restaurant gets added to my S@#t list and I will look elsewhere to dine.",
