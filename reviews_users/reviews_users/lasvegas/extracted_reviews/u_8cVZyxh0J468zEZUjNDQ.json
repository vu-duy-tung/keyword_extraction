Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. Other than that the pizza was great. Not too much pizza sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Pepperoni was crispy just how I like it. Andddddd maybe the women should wear hair nets. Just a suggestion.",

Not a bad deal for lunch especially on the strip.  I liked my white pizza better than the pepperoni. Something about the sauce on the pepperoni I wasn't feeling, but over all good pizza. You will definitely be full! they are located right next to PINK'S. There is limited seating, but you really dont need to sit down. Just eat your pizza standing up and watch all the people look and drool at you while they walk by.",

We were suppose to go to secret pizza but the group decided to end things early. After thinking of pizza for almost the whole day, I saw pin up pizza and dedcided to check it out.   The line was super short on a friday night. I believe I only had to wait three person to order. I ended up getting the Sausage pizza. Yummy. The thin crust pizza is the best and they reheat up the pizza, so you're getting a nice hot out of the oven pizza. The pizza was indeed a huge slice. My hubby didn't get one cause he knew I wouldn't finish it. In my mind, I was thinking i'll show him, but really I ate like five bites and still it was so much pizza left. He was very happy to finish the rest for me.   For the price and sizes of the pizza it was an excellent deal. I would come back and try their chicken and spinach pizza. I was so eyeing that pizza.",

There was barely sauce or meat on it. Lacked of flavors. They looked sad on the countertop. Overall, a overrated joint. I'm guessing those 5 star reviews are from drunk people or people who eat mac n cheese with ranch.",

Open late till 2 a.m. M-Th & till 4 a.m. Fri & Sat this is the perfect munchie spot for a late night craving. They have very limited seating inside and outside so make sure and have a buddy reserve a seat for you while you wait in line.       The pizza slices here are ginormous! I'm glad I only ordered one slice because I had no idea they were that large. The pizza was good but it was a little too thin and a little too greasy for me. It did satisfy my pizza craving though.       Next time I'm in Vegas and have the late night munchies, I know exactly where I'm headed.",

Didn't allow us time to figure out what slices we want since it was our first time there also because there are no name labels for which pizza has which toppings. She also did not finish taking our order and moved onto multiple guests after we had reminded her we were not done she told us to wait. Luckily the pizza wasn't as bad as her attitude. Seemed like even asking was an issue. She kept asking if we were done after every slice we would mention including the first considering there are more than one of us ordering food. Wouldn't reccomend or go back.",

The pizza is huge and 2 people could eat off this one slice. The staff are dressed so classy and put you in the mind of the pin up models hence the name. You select your pizza from the ones on display and they put them in their huge stove so you can actually see what your going to get before you order. We got the pepparoni, salami, peppercheni one it was amaizing! It does not take too long to get your food, my only complaint is there is really no room to eat your pizza there we had to go next door to the pinks hotdog place to sit and eat. The one thing i enjoy about some of the places on the strip is you can people watch as you eat your food, there are some interesting people who walk the strip...lol",

The humongous slice of pizza gets heated up in the oven and it was so good. Each slice was worth roughly $6-7. But the slice equals 3 pizza hut slices. Not only is it a generous portion, it taste really good. The bread of the pizza has a crisp. Cook to perfection! It is also bad a$$ to see the cook put in the whole pizza in the oven.

If you've had Costco pizza you know how big the slices are, but this place tops it. A single slice is 15 inches. I felt the pricing was more than fair. A slice, garlic knot, and refillable soda for $8.99. I think that is a good value. Pizza was very good, it's thin crust, and the garlic knot was great as well. The women working there had the pinup look which was a good touch. There was a gentlemen by the name of Benji who who as great guy. Everyone there was very welcoming.  I probably would have given this place 4 stars since the seating wasn't that great. Small outside patio section and small standing counter inside. So it did get a little crowded in there considering its 100 outside. But considering there is a walkway to a sports book inside the casino, it regained that star. Pizza and sports. Can't get much better than that. I definitely suggest this place if you are looking for a large slice of pizza with employees who play the part.",

Loved it. Had a slice with sausage (good Italian sausage), a garlic knot and a beer for $11.50. I ate it in the shop standing up and I'm ok with that. Saw them give marinara for other guests. Friendly staff. You should see the size of the pies that make these HUGE slices! Wow. Strongly recommend - I'm going to get one tonight for my 5:30 breakfast ;) - probably the only time they are not open.",

    "text": "Ah, so this is the new kid on the Vegas pizza block. Thanks to Yelp, I bookmarked Pin Up for my recent trip. I missed it the evening while navigating Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile, so I made it a mission to find it the following day. It was still early when we got there, so we ordered the Sandra D. combo (slice, knot, soda) which is a reasonable deal. As expected, the pizza and slices are enormous. When ordering, the guy expected us to get in two orders and questioned just the one, but honestly, come on, that big @## slice can't be consumed by one person in one sitting. I mean, yeah, sure it can, but with all the good stuff to try in Vegas, we made this a shareable snack before hitting up other places. The pizza was decent though, and the garlic knot was pretty good for its size. Service was quick, especially since we were able to beat the lunchtime rush. We were just a little confused about where to eat the food. It's a pizza joint, so not a lot of space, but it's standing room only inside and outside, or you can follow the corridor leading directly to the PH sportsbook.",

It is one of the most affordables at about $6 for a huge slice they put in a box..Which you can share if you like...Because of the affordability...We had them more than once...I would suggest you buy drinks off the strip and keep them in a cooler...Unless you don't mind shelling out $3 per small cup of soda! The location is also great...Right in the middle of the Strip! Great location to people watch...I do not suggest this pizza for people who are looking for healthy! This is more for the hungry...Who want to save money on the Strip.*",

    "text": "The pizza slices are an absolute eye delight!!  The pizza was very good-one slice was all it took.  Ok I did throw in a beer as well!   On a side note, we did ask the pizza place if we could go to the back area to sit and eat which they said yes to.  However,  once back there at a table, we were informed no we needed to sit in the chairs down below as the table sitting area was reserved for restaurant patrons.  Do not sit in the The Ringers Sports Bar and Racing Casino at Planet Hollywood, that area is reserved.  Would be nice to be redirected nicely. So, yes that was a down point for us.  Did not see anyone ordering food nor see anyone moving to sit in the area which we had been sitting in.  The only crowded area was indeed those chairs which we were directed to sit.  So IF you do go to buy pizza, be warned - do not sit anywhere but the crowded chair area.  You will be told to move for non existent restaurant patrons who are not purchasing food from this casino/bar.  Better yet, buy your pizza and stand at the strip window area to watch the people outside!",

The pancetta one was one of my favorites. Order a slice, they will throw it in the oven to warm it up and you're good to go. The slices are huge. 2-3 slices make up a regular large pizza from Pizza Hut.   Kudos to the girls that work here. When it gets busy and they have those customers that can't decide what they want or order 19 different slices in different ways, they keep their cool and are always nice and pleasant to each customer. I was getting annoyed just waiting for the other customer order a bunch of stuff only to change his minds 3 times, tell her they are eating there then turn around and make her box it all up.

    "text": "Conveniently located around the Planet Hollywood area, reasonably priced specials, large slices, fast takeout service, and friendly service. Open late, until 4 AM. Very tiny spot, and if a line were to form, it could not accommodate it. At best, could not fit more than 6 people. Would not recommend eating here, even if there is a standing section by the window to eat/people watch. Can be uncomfortable with people coming and going in such a cramped space.   Came here for a hearty bite that I didn't have to wait long for: heated it up, boxed it in their giant slice box, and I was on my way.   Plain cheese slice: Thin crust, and perfectly balanced sauce and cheese ratio.  $6  Margherita slice: Yum, so good! Didn't have a lot of sauce, or cheese, but it was OK, since too much of either would not have mixed well with the roasted tomatoes on top. Delicious and colorful, as the tomatoes were red, yellow. Enjoyed the acidic punch. Wasn't much basil on it though. $6.75  Garlic knot: was the biggest disappoint. Not sure what kind of roll they used, but it was soft, and lacked any kind of bite or chew to it. Felt like a cheap store bought potato roll that they slathered some butter on. Didn't even have any garlic taste to it either. If they're going to try to pass off a dinner roll as a garlic knot, at least use some freshly cooked garlic on top! Didn't even finish the one knot I had, and my husband who loves bread and butter, didn't even bother eating the piece I couldn't finish.  $1.25 for single/ $3.25 for 4  Overall, still worth a visit, because they have affordable combos here:  Bettie P. Combo- slice, knot, beet for $11.75 Sandra D. Combo - slice, knot, soda for $9.75  As other Yelpers have said, it's not cheap, but nothing on the Strip is. In comparison, this is probably one of the cheaper options, considering the slices are very long. I would estimate at least a foot if not a bit longer! Also sell cannolis, an assortment of soft drinks, bottled water, beer.   Was really glad I came here for dinner!",

It was a little hard to find considering it is a small establishment; way smaller than I thought it was going to be. You walk in and it has retro vintage decor with the cashier dressed as a pin-up girl. She was super sweet and welcoming. I can't recall the price but I believe it was $6 for a combo meal- 1 slice and 1 drink.  The slices are HUGE. Definitely bigger than your head. This pizza is very comparable to Villa or Sbarro pizza. It was just very mediocre and nothing crazy. The \"wow\" factor was the size of the pizza and that's about it. Considering there is only standing room, I would not recommend this place if you are looking to sit down and have a nice meal.",

They make these fresh slices  for sure in  front of your face and they have great deals here and the line is long for sure. If you want to come be prepared to be waiting but they are super fast. They are basically on the strip with a outside seating and it's a small place but pizza in this area is awesome. They have great deals for vegetarians and meat eaters with all kinds of pizza. They have cannolis but I wasn't a fan of them they were not that awesome. The main thing to get is like the 10 dollar deal you get  garlic bread knot a slice of your choice veg or meat and you get a soda. Make sure you ask them to give you marinara sauce on the side so you can dip everything in there because it's so tasty and mouth watering. My first time in Vegas trying this place I loved it, I could not on a Sunday express my feeling after being hung over and having a  hot veg cheese slice. My friends got the spinach  and chicken with white sauce and loved it. The price is great there pizza is awesome and it's so thin but there slices are super big. No way in this world you can eat two I do not think so because you might be super full. It was a group of ten people that went with us last time enjoy a soda get a slice they have great deals stand outside in the heat or stand inside eat some fresh hot pizza in there get it crispy and enjoy some really good cheese slices. If  I come back to Vegas and  am walking by this place I'm defiantly  going to go back grab a slice a garlic knot and a soda and enjoy.",

They wouldn't sell us one and said they only sell it by the piece at $10 each.  We tried to explain ok fine but we want the pie not in a box. Well they can't do that. The reason is there is no place to sit. This is basically a grab and go place. Very disappointed. However there are many good pizza places in Vegas so don't be discouraged just venture on to the next one!",

Watching the chef toss the big pizza crust in the air was crazy. It's a small place but I think it's really cool. For a slice of pizza, garlic knot and a beer, it's 12 bucks; 10 for a soda instead. I never got something so cheap in Vegas before. The slices are probably 2 1/2 slices in one. You wouldn't think they would fill you up but it does. The pizza is so good and so is the garlic knot. Definitely suggest you going here if you want social media pics.",

While you wait in the long line that moves relatively quickly you are entertained by trying to guess the pin ups ranging from Jane Mansfield to Rhiana. The pizza is par baked in a brick oven and then when you order it they stick your slice on the oven. By the time you pay it is ready. Genius. Last night we had a slice of pepperoni, margarita, and prosciutto with mushrooms. The margarita was my favorite. It was loaded with grape tomatoes that had been marinated in a vinaigrette and married perfectly with the fresh mozzarella.   If you are looking for a late night take out bite this is totally it.",

Every slice I have had (I went there about 4 - 5 times during my drinking bender) was amazing (sober or drunk) 3. The slices are huge and 1 should be able to fill up any normal person.  I am not normal so I always get two.  The cheese is fresh, as you can tell by the amazing amount of grease the rolls off the slices as you fold them in half.  They have red pepper, Siracha and other condiments for your pizza eating joy.  And did I mention they were open until 4am?  Find another place that you can get for ~$10, get a great piece of chow, and be on your way in minutes at 3 AM on the strip without having to drive?  There is Denny's but seriously?  After drinking, Denny's is sobering up, at 3 am in Vegas I want to keep it going - so this works great.  You won't be upset if you try it.  The women even dress up in corsets which is funny.",

Ordered a cheese slice and a specialty (ham + potato something) slice. Ate it cold as they ran out of to-go boxes and I had to carry the slices back on open paper plates. Why not eat at the shop? I hear you ask. Well, there is minimal seating (outdoor) and it was early morning. Which meant having to dodge drunk \"whoo-hoo!!!\" girls as they puke out their sugary pink drinks and pizza. So nope, I grabbed my slices to-go.  Cost about US$15 for two slices. Not bad, considering the location.   I was promised service by \"pin up girls\". But no such luck. Serving guys behind the counter was brisk and efficient. Two cashier girls spent a few minutes chatting among themselves (probably changing shifts) before one surly asked me what I ordered and ringing me up.  \"Will I come back?\" Yes. But will be a quick stop to grab and go. Early morning on the Strip is not for the faint hearted.",

The girl who served us was the cashier who was tatted up and she was not having it today. We heard the pizza was good here so we decided to order almost one of every slice to see what was good. The food was okay, but it doesn't make up the cashier's horrible attitude. At first I was like maybe she doesn't like asian guys, but NOPE she was just rude to everyone that walked in. Was a straight prick to every customer and had so much attitude and sass I regretted ordering and dining in here. Management seriously needs to check up on her behavior... This is straight up something I would see on a tv show like kitchen nightmare with horrible owners. No need to come back here for mediocre pizza.

If you walk here, it's approx. 1 mile from Harrah's to Planet Hollywood. 15-20 mins. to walk??? So you can work off some calories then eat then walk off the carbs again!   NO LINE TODAY at 1pm!   No more patio seating or seats inside this restaurant. Yes, it's hard to find, it's next to the Sportsbook area (waaaaaay in the back of the Planet Hollywood casino) yes just stay to the right and look for the pizza by the slice neon sign. Or if you stay on the outside, walk around the shops and it's next to Pinks hot dogs.   Got me a Bettie P. Combo, $11.75 price as of August 21, 2017, IMO I think it's one of the best meal deals on the Strip. It's good enough to share if you just want to satisfy your appetite or it's good for one hungry person like me!  Only one pin-up girl working today and one chef. I guess it's not too busy during the day compared to evenings and after hitting up the clubs.  Just get the meatball-pepperoni-pancetta-Italian sausage pizza. With beer. With the solo garlic knot. The best cure-all! Deeelish NY style cheesy thin crust pizza. Not too saucy and that's good for me otherwise the heartburn would've been in overdrive.  I've been to NYC a few times but this is without the attitude!!!!   Just ask for the pizza box cause I think the plate is pointless.....or they should serve it on parchment paper. Ate the huge-ass slice in the sportsbook area while watching the soccer games. No big deal.",

    "text": "\"...that's what she said.\"  Yeah yeah, keep the jokes coming because that pizza is MASSIVE!    Pin Up Pizza is located outside of Planet Hollywood next to Pink's Hot Dog.  It's a small shop with an indoor and outdoor stand up counters to eat.  Pizzas run for less than $6 a slice!  Where they get you is the price of beverages.... $3 for a 16 oz soda??   I got the spinach artichoke pizza.  There were huge chunks of artichoke and some spinach scattered around.  It was a little bland but nothing like some Italian seasoning and chili flakes to do the trick.  The pizza holds its form well so you can hold it without worrying about the toppings sliding off from a floppy pizza. Bonus!  Open until 2AM.  Pin Up Pizza is worth checking out for a quick and inexpensive meal that will definitely hit the spot!",

Since I just ordered a slice she took the slice from the pizza out from the display case and heated the pizza in the oven. The order also came with a garlic bread which was fluffy and sooo buttery, I loved it!  This place is pretty small. There is no seating inside but there are a few seats and tables outside. Sitting outside can be disturbing because birds come to feast on any crumb or leftover",

I got their Margherita pizza which was bit really classic Margherita by definition. It was a white pizza with fresh mozzarella, grape tomatoes and basil. The crust was good but not life changing, the fresh mozzarella tasted good but was not cut thin enough or spread across the pie.  Normally this would be a 2 star review but the crew and the decor of the place gave them that edge to a 3 star.  Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I tell friends, oh my God, you need to try this place. Not likely.  Good place in a pinch. But it going out of my way to go there.",

I opted for a pepperoni slice $7, prosciutto arugula $7, & (4) garlic knots for $3. They pop them into the oven to crisp it up and voila you are on your way. Overall the pizza was okay, nothing special, just huge slices but it wasn't bad either. It's a reasonable meal and the service was quick and friendly for as fast paced as it is.",

    "text": "This is right by Planet Hollywood. I was kind of dying and needing some fuel after a huge AYCE dinner the night before and skipping breakfast and lunch today. So after walking the Las Vegas Strip for hours I decided not to pass out and get something that was Vegas and something that was a good deal.   Good deal for the strip shops it was. $10.25 for a Huge Slice+knot+soda. I got the meat slice. BTW your slice is taken out of a 30\" pizza! The gal taking the order and ringing up was super cool (she has a ton of cool tattoo work done also). I didn't get her name but she was definitely great at giving excellent service. If you are lucky, you will get her in the evening.  I read a lot of complaints about the late night service and long lines. That is to be expected due to the burgeoning crowds that descend on the Strip at night.   I got there around maybe 6pm and stood at their inside strip table and ate. There is an outside L-shaped strip table too. Very little room and no seating. The pizza was a little better than average with a decent smattering of toppings. The crust was tasteless so I tossed it into the river (JK!) :-)  They have a good selection of slices like for instance the margherita, pancetta and mushroom, cheese, spinach and cheese and more.   They have a really cool box shaped like a slice but big enough to fit your giant slice. I did not need one as it is only for to-go orders. Again, the gal who helped me was superb and very nice. I would rate them a 3.5 and the half goes to that girl who was bomb. Other than that it is a good novelty. The pizza rates a 3 or 3.5. I have to lean on a 3 rather than a 4 as it has to to be compelling for me or I round down. It would be great if Yelp would add a 1/2 star option but I don't think that will happen as they want to keep it simple. All in all, if you are hungry it is a good value and does the job. Not awesome but not anywhere bad either.",

Very small place with just a counter to order and a standing bar to eat. No tables or seating. Good prices. I had a huge slice of pizza, bread knot, and soda for about 10 dollars. Plenty to fill you up.",

The seating outside is very limited and they had no boxes to go. So there is no sitting outside and no boxes to go, what your customers suppose to do? This is what exactly happened to us. If you guys know how popular you are you should have sufficient amount of boxes for those who want to take out. Also it is very tiny and squishy, very inconvenient. On top of that there is no restroom inside. The staff is not polite, they want you out as soon as possible. So no wonder I wanted to be out as soon as possible.",

The margherita pizza featured fresh heirloom tomato, mozzarella, and a good amount of basil. The portion is huge, meaning one slice is more than enough to fill you up.   The one issue I had was that adding arugula and balsamic costs another 2.25, when you can get it on certain pizzas for the same price as the margherita (7.00 a slice). I'm already getting one of the only meat-free pizzas on the menu and you're going to charge me more for cheaper ingredients?",

I absolutely love the pizza and the garlic knot was not tiny at all and was soooo fluffy and light on the inside. Staff was gorgeous and friendly. Biggest pizza I've ever seen offered for sale and yes you can purchase their pizzas as a whole though they typically have a variety of offerings made that you order by the slice and I think it's adorable they call that welcome mat a slice.... it was hanging off the plate in piping hot deliciousness on every angle and topped with a garlic knot bigger than my fist. Be staring or plan to share!!  This area of dining is a hard one especially in LV because there so so many great places to choose from and great pizza joints across the US but I can say with ease this is the best!  I cannot wait for my next visit back to LV and I tell everyone who goes to stop by and grab a slice they will not be sorry",

It was kinda exciting just being there and watching the guy toss the dough and we met some really fun people while standing in line! The chicken and spinach pizza was really good, much better than I expected after reading other reviews. The staff was really nice and polite. If you like pizza then go check out this spot. It's a cool experience! Being that we are in Vegas often, I will definitely come back!",

Definitely hits the spot when you want a slice of pizza. Service was friendly and super fast.   The slice was HUGE.

We got the garlic knot (the size of my fist!) and a slice of margherita.  I thought it was a little expensive, but you do get a humongous slice.  I really thought that this was going to be all gimmick with no delivery, but I was wrong.  The tomatoes were fresh and juicy, and the moz was cut thick and had wonderful texture.  The bread was thin like Italian style but had more crunch to it; very delicious.  If I want to be picky, I'd say that the oil making riveluts down my slice was over much, but you don't come here looking for healthy options.  The garlic knot was soft and flavorful, but the headliner was clearly the pizza.  IMHO, this place bests Secret Pizza and I will return to try the other slices.",

Its located right outside of Planet Hollywood along the strip and have a back way into the sports betting area. The workers here are friendly and sweet.

I guess it's too much to ask politely could we move the containers where they belong and someone mistakenly set them at the register . She said she does not care if I report her . It's clear she hates her job . My friends told her we are all in service industry and would never disrespect customers in that way .

Everyone said It was good and a need to try place. It was good but not a need to try place. You actually go for the experience of being able to put a picture on instagram or Snapchat. As for a need to try eh I mean there is other places that you can try. Overall the pizza was good though. I had the pepperoni slice and I tried the prosciutto and arugula. The crust was thin and crunchy but soft inside. The sauce was not over powering and had good flavoring. The pepperoni slice had a good amount of meat on it. The prosciutto one was my favorite!! Make sure you get all the fixings if not then why get it? They add arugula tomato's and vinaigrette. That puts it over the top. I got lucky when we went in my wife and I only waited a little over 20 mins. I would say if no line then go get yourself a slice but as to wait in a long line and wait then maybe look for another spot......oooo if you go in during the day mind you the sun hits them directly so it might be a little hot when eating on the counter inside.",

They posted a video of these enormous slices of pizza, and i myself being a pizza addict, had to try it! On a recent trip to Vegas we stopped in on a Monday afternoon around noon and waited in line for about 20 minutes (not bad considering that you're in Vegas and the lines everywhere are bound to be long). The pizza was delicious, and as advertised, bigger than my head! The prices were great as well. $6-$8 for a slice, or  $12-$13 for a combo (pizza, garlic knot, drink) depending on if you're getting pop or a beer.   There are no tables, just standing room only, so not great for groups. However, great to stop in for a late night snack (they're open till 4am!!). I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Anway, the pizzas, getting their novelty from their size are not that great. Most of the flavors are pretty basic, with a few more interesting flavors. It's a small shop where you order in line and grab your slice after a minute or two of them heating yours up in the big open oven they have right in the ordering/kitchen area.   I'm not really a pizza person because they're just kind of peanut-butter and jelly (boring), and this pizza didn't really change my mind from that. It's about the same as most pizza I've had, kinda crunchy, not much sauce, and a bit oily from the cheese and other toppings. It's alright for a quick bite if you're nearby, but there's certainly other food on the strip that's more fulfilling (and filling), for probably about the same price.   I'd say it's not really worth it, but then again, for me most pizza isn't worth it. If you want the novelty of a slice it won't set you back very much but you're probably better off getting something elsewhere.",

    "text": "Pin-Up Pizza is an adorable little pizza shop located  right outside Planet Hollywood on the strip! It's very small, and has barely anywhere to eat so I suggest getting your slice to go!  The atmosphere/decor/vibe: Its small, quaint, and simple. You come in, order your slice and enjoy! It's high pace in there though because of how many people are all trying to get pizza at once. So don't expect to gradually order. Everyone is pretty friendly and of course it's a clean environment!  The Service: The girls are all dressed up in cute Pin-Up outfits! They are nice for the most part, a little abrupt but it makes sense as to why. It's hot in there, some customers are very demanding and it's a small space with huge ovens emitting a bunch of heat.  The Food: There are not very many pizzas to choose from but everything there is delicious! The sauce is very unique and the pizza slices are giant. I truly wish I had the stomach to eat more than one slice, it was so delicious! It's a little expensive, but what isn't expensive in Vegas? Also, no gluten free options :(  Overall: I love this pizza, I wish it was a bigger space but for what it is, it's good! I will always come back here every time I visit Vegas & I highly recommend any pizza lover to stop in and try a slice!",

As for pizza options on the strip, I'd say this is a pretty decent one. The pizza slices are warmed to order & offer a decent variety of options. Pricing isn't too bad given it's location: A Sandra D combo will only run you $10.50 for a slice of pizza, garlic knot and a drink!  (that is if it's all available...I've waited in line only to find that they've run out of garlic knots-still offered the combo at same price but minus the knot) Downsides: Line can extend out into the sports book on busier days & doesn't move as fast as one would expect. In the past I've found you can actually sit down in the sport book/bar and order a slice to bypass this. Seating is limited to standing room only & when there's a crowd, you're better off taking your food on the go. Food availability-on several occasions I've found that they are out of garlic knots and/or canolis.  Overall: If you're in the area and looking for pizza & something to post on facebook/instagram, try it out.",

It's a cute little restaurant & the staff dress in theme which is super cute. The lady who took the orders was amazing. She was fast and super nice.    The price was reasonable especially for the size of slice you get. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I would for sure stop by again!  There is no seating. More of a take out/take & go place. They do have a little standing area outside of the restaurant where you can stand and eat.   Overall it's a cool concept. Great late night meal.",

Goal - Acquire giant pizza.   It was about 2:30 AM when we rolled up to Pin-Up Pizza, and the line was still out the door. However, I'm positive it would've been worse had we gone earlier in the day or during pregame hours. This place is open until 4 AM, though. So I'm only assuming they probably get bad around 3/3:30 too.   At any rate, this place is straight up, no-frills, basic PIZZA, DRINKS, AND KNOTS. Nothing else. Just like a pizza place should be. NOTE - knots aren't available at 2:30 AM, hence 4 out of 5 stars.   I got the prosciutto and arugula pizza, which was delicious but had no arugula on it (?). They subbed arugula with red onion, which still gave it a decent bite and added flavor to compliment the prosciutto. The prosciutto was perfectly crispy and melted in my mouth with every bite. Everything about this slice was perfect - the crispy crust, the perfectly cooked salty prosciutto, the bite from the onion, the mellow white sauce, and lest we not forget the CHEESE PULL.   Come to Pin-Up Pizza. Wait in line. Instagram the hell out of your slice. Go back for more. Repeat until you never want pizza again in your life.",

I ate here at the end of my stay when I was broke and looking for something cheap and fast on the strip. $5.65 for a piece of pizza bigger than my head? Sold! However the pizza was not now I like it. It was extremely greasy, very very thin, and crunchy. I know that's how some people like their pizza so of you do, this is the place for you!",

The pizza had so much flavor & perfect amount of cheese. You get it piping hot out of the oven! My gf got the cheese & I got the ultimate meat one. The cheese was all gooey & perfect. My pizza, had real meatballs, sausage, bacon, ham & pepperoni! A lot of meat which kinda overwhelmed the pizza but high quality. We also tried the garlic knots & OMG!! Those were the best things ever! When you see then there just covered in garlic then when you order them, they put them in the oven & you get them all buttery & garlic & they put all garlic rolls to shame. The price is perfect & also great access to the sports room next door to eat while watching & betting on games",

My husband and I sat in the sportsbook for sometime watching the NBA playoffs and we smelled delicious pizza all day long so naturally we had to grab a slice. We got the meatball pizza which was tasty however I tend to like more sauce on my pizza. Thin crust, the right amount of cheese, and huge meatballs tasted good. I hardly tasted the sauce. I loved that this pizza did not give me heartburn. Many times pizza will give me heartburn because of the acidic sauce. Not this pizza. They have a variety of pizza's as well as garlic knots, and cannolis. A slice of meatball pizza was $6.50. You can get a slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and a beer for 10.99. This is a grab and go style eatery. There are places to stand outside and eat your pizza with a high top counter but there is nowhere to sit.",

Long lines, and the anticipation of getting a great piece of pizza was making our mouths water. Small place,, counter space where you stand up and eat. Most people were buying the pizza as take out and sitting next door so they could comfortably eat. Away from the crowds and scorching heat. The pizza is thin crust, hand tossed, a big slice cooked in a brick oven.  They have a variety of pizza from all meats, pepperoni & cheese, cheese, vegetarian, and there's 1 more that looked like it had alfredo sauce.. they could put more toppings. The combo $10-12  gets you a slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and cold drink. We had that.  The meats pizza slice had toppings on it, soda regular size, but the garlic knots didn't taste as good as it looked. Needs more butter and garlic. . The bread wasnt pull apart soft and was dry. They need to work on this. The regular gal working there in the dark long hair wasn't friendly. No smile and lack customer service skills. The bakers and cooks were more friendly than her.",

    "text": "So let me start by saying how excited I was to try this place. I had seen this on fb of new places to try in Vegas. My husband and our friends are not real pizza people but they went for me. We walked in no greeting or acknowledgement by the girl behind the counter but ok. We were asked what we wanted ordered 4 pizza combos which included 1 slice of pizza, 1 bread knot & 1 beer. The pizza is behind the counter sliced, you pick the flavor of pizza you like and they throw the slice in the pizza oven behind them to reheat. She took our order and rang us up. Before she gave us our food, my receipt to sign or our drinks she was onto the next customer. I was waiting and waiting for her to give me our drinks or finish ringing me up. Finally, Our total was 55.00. I signed the receipt and was into my wallet to give her cash in the tip jar once we got our food. I personally try to always give cash so it's money in their hand and not taxed on their paycheck. But low and behold the minute she took my receipt and noticed no tip was written down she started talking in Spanish to the Hispanic man making more pizzas behind her. Talking crap about how people should learn to tip at least 10% and her tip should've been 8.00. For what? For being snobby lacking customer service skills and literally taking our order. I tip sometimes 30-40% for great service and won't tip for shitty service. What she didn't realize is that we all spoke Spanish so we understood all the rude things she was saying. We didn't comment to her because unlike her we have class and you can't argue with stupidity. We got our food and left. The pizza btw is already cooked sitting out they just put in oven to reheat. Overall the pizza was good but service and experience was awful. I was so disappointed. It really made me wish I would've went anywhere else. There are too many other good places to eat in Vegas that want your business. I won't be back. Our friends won't be back and I will be letting everyone I know that Pin-Up pizza is a waste of money. 1 star for good pizza and because you have to leave at least 1 Star  but nothing else. Bad experience.The server according to my receipt is Stacy R. and what's sad is I didn't know that customer shaming is what this business promotes. Bullying from an employee is still bullying by shaming and embarrassing them, over something that if you would've waited a minute you probably would've got anyway.",

    "text": "BURNED  This end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from \"The Daily Show\" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry.   So here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it.   I finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, \"Hey be careful because it's really hot!\" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry.   I ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas.   I really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.  On a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps. It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies. These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Aside from the fact that I felt like total crap after eating the pizza, it was quite tasty.  All five of our children had a slice and most finished 3/4 of it.  The kids were in awe of the size.  The knots were a hit, and I highly recommend the Sandra D, which is the value meal with a slice, a knot and a refillable soda. There is no seating, and little standing space.   We had a slight wait, but the staff is as efficient as they can be and had us through in under 10 minutes.   There are pin ups everywhere (thus the name) and can provide great (teachable/informative) conversations with your children, no matter what the age. :). It's pretty tame compared to what you see on the street.   We were just passing through, but this restaurant was a hit and if we pass through again, with the kids, it will probably be suggested as a place to stop. The staff was very friendly and great with the kids (patient).   It was a little difficult to find, but it's at the mile mall easily accessible outside, you can get to it from inside by the sport book, but the \"pizza by the slice\" sign says just that- it does not specify the name of the restaurant, which made it a little confusing.",

The ambience is really great - this is something that is important to me. The pizza selections are great and it's not overly done. I had the pepperoni and my wife had the cheese - she's pretty particular with pizza and she was happy with the pizza. Not too much cheese and just the right thickness (it's pretty thin). The slices are pretty big - bigger than the paper plate it comes on so it is more than enough to fill you up. You must get the pizza, drink, and garlic knot combo. The garlic knot is DELICIOUS. I wish I had more. It's soft and slightly chewy and great seasoning. Like a puff knot with substance. Good food and you can't beat it. True NY style pizza. Delicious.",

He had never been either, but saw the equally enticing videos on Facebook and Youtube. We honestly didn't know what to expect or where it was. We parked and walked around the little area of the strip where the navigation was telling us to go. Someone pointed us in the direction. It's a little setup that you can see from the street. It is VERY tiny and there is a little setup right outside the exit to stand and eat. We waited in line about 15 minutes so not crazy long. The line did intimidate at first, but we were really hungry. I got a slice with a garlic knot and a soda. He got 2 slices and a soda. It came to around 30 I believe which for the strip, I don't think is terrible. I got standard cheese. He got some different combos. The girl are the register was really nice. There was another girl who I think may have been new and seemed a little frustrated, but it didn't put us off getting our pizza.  We got a little shoulder to shoulder with other people cramming pizza in their mouth holes. I was really all about that garlic knot and I recommend getting more than one because that shit was delicious. Our slices were massive and really yummy. I feel like if you want something that is solid, will hit the spot, and maybe soak up the alcohol in your belly-this is the place you go to. I am really happy with it and would come back and will recommend to friends and family. I like that you can fold the slices-more like NY style. I know that's not for everything, but it was really yummy. Definitely get the garlic knots!",

She said 4am, that's 1 hour and 10 minutes from closing time, do you guys not think if you make one more pepperoni pizza that it won't sell out? I mean it's obvious it's the most popular since there was none left, couldn't even throw some pepperoni on a cheese slice and heat it in the oven. Very disappointed, I left a One Bite Review on the One Bite app, score 0.0!",

The service was great the girl behind the counter was friendly, full of energy and just fun.  Paid $20 for 1 soda and 2 slices of pepperoni pizza. Not too bad for the strip. Seating..... well there was none and only counter space to stand at outside which even at midnight is 100 degrees lol  was not pleasant. The trash cans we over flowing so everyone just left their trash and boxes on the counter that you were supposed to eat on. They seemed understaffed. Also they didn't have any ranch dressing which was very disappointing. Probably won't go back to this place when in Vegas. I think the only reason I gave three stars was the bubbly girl behind the counter because customer service matters",

    "text": "Pin Up Pizza is located in front of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino right along the Vegas Strip. It has a walk up counter and a few seats. In addition to whole pizza pies and slices, they also serve some pretty amazing garlic knot rolls. They are super garlicky and buttery but flaky and light like a croissant. For better or worse, I could easily eat a dozen of these.  In addition to the good looking food they also have good looking staff dressed in classic pin up girl uniforms. You could waste an entire night watching these ladies load in and take out the slices from the oven. Now I should probably talk about the pizza. It is some of the least expensive and largest slices on the strip, Weighing in at a staggering 14 inch slice for about $5.00. It is also some of the best depending on the kind you get. I found the pepperoni to be just average, the sauce was just a little to thick and the crust just a little under cooked. The winner for me was the white pizza, topped with Ricotta, Chicken, Mozzarella, fennel and spinach. The thin crust was cooked perfectly crispy and the toppings were abundant but not so much that it made the crust soggy. This particular slice was on par with my favorite pizza at The Secret Pizza across the road at The Cosmopolitan. So overall one slice was just okay and the other was one of the best i have had. I will probably make this a routine stop in the future. Good staff, good pizza and good times can be found at Pin Up Pizza.",

Yes, my review is biased by my Vegas experience, but that's anticipated - alcohol makes everything better:)  Viva Pin Up Pizza!",

Their pizza portion is HUGE even for just one slice. We decided to get two kinds when we saw their menu. One was the chicken & spinach and the other one was the Salami Trio. To be honest, their Salami one was nothing special. All I can remember from it was that it was salty. The chicken and spinach pizza was really good, however. Not too salty and not too creamy. I would come back for that slice! You can get it to go or eat at the shop, but the shop isn't very big at all. They warm it up for you right after you order so it's nice and piping hot! However, the only thing I could think that I didn't like was that they didn't have any cheese/pepper for to-go.",

And not too expensive either, only $6.50 plus tax for a pepperoni slice. The line can get pretty long but it goes fairly quick. I like their $9 combo which included a slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and soda, pretty good deal. The only thin i wish there could have been was tables. All they had was this little table/bar stand to place your plate, but considering how popular that place it, they definitely need more. I had trouble locating it at first, but was able to find it since i remember seeing it while driving, which its outside right next to Pink's Hot Dogs.  There were a few different toppings. I saw some of them with salami, only cheese, another with no sauce with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese, and even chicken with spinach.   I'd recommend to try it!",

The meatball pizza was good too, but I liked the chicken and spinach pizza more. For the price of a slice, it is pricey compared to BYO pizza (MOD, Pieology, Blaze), but it was a great eat in LV.  The slices were inconsistent though, since the first slice I got was much bigger than the second slice. Overall, since I am a pizza lover, I would definitely come here again and try all the different types.",

We had two teenagers with us, and they were not quite sure what they wanted so me and my sister ordered first. My daughter and her cousin then ordered. We were deciding if we should order more. Even though no one else was there, Angela kept \"asking\" if we wanted anything else. When I finally asked if she was in a hurry - she snidely replied that we all should have been ready to order.  A place with a name with Pin Up Pizza should train their employees to not only provide good food but also the \"experience\".  Angela - even though you were dressed for the part, you certainly did not have the personality for a pin up girl. Thanks for ruining our visit!",

    "text": "2 stars because although the product was good, the quality of service  (the older one who takes the orders) & your pricing is out of line. We ordered 1 slice and 1 combo which I placed myself for the 2 of us.  I asked for a slice that was advertised and added a topping. Since they didn't have it made,  she charged me for a cheese slice and 2 extra toppings, costing me an extra $3 if they would of had it made. Whatever,  I was hungry,  wasn't trying to ruin my mood over $3. But it got worse... she then did the extract same thing to my fiance.  I told her the name of the combo, he told her the he wanted,  although the slice was what they advertised (no change), since it wasn't made she charged him an extra $2.25 and didn't put his garlic knot in the oven.  Get to the register and these 2 orders came out to be $24 (WHAAAA ???) AND no knot?  She proceeds to look at my fiance and says, \"You didn't order it from me\" with the rudest tone. He said, (pointing at me) She did and I did.  She kept arguing with him.  LOOK LADY, It's a Flippin garlic knot, part of the combo, all ya gotta do is pop it in the oven to heat up! What seems to be your issue?? He says to her,  look, I did because you told this girl (at register) my order and I paid for it. Plus a little extra you inflated. Just give it to me.\" Sheesh!  She finally gave it but with the worst attitude of anyone WITHOUT merit. How hard is it to do your job and be nice to people? The pizza is good, but charging the way you do when you fail to keep your products available is bad business. Charging $73 for a whole pie is stupid ridiculous. You have a good product and you do well only because of this and your location.  People in Vegas blow money like crazy, but that's not a reason to take advantage of your customers and treat them like shit. Although we like your pizza, I would rather spend my money else where so I'm treated with respect and not having my wallet raped.  No recommendation here.  Go to Secret Pizza in Cosmopolitan or New York Slice by Harrah's. Both are just as good, if not better, cheaper and service is 5 Star! Peace!",

    "text": "OK, the pizza's cheap, and you get a lot for your money, unlike many other places in Vegas.  But come on, people!  No To-Go boxes?  There's no seating and you've got to either leave the store to eat your slice or stand at a bar and eat it, hoping not to get knocked around by people ordering.  Not cool.    Zero people skills by the two employees, either.  They were an assembly line and efficient, but part of any dining experience is service, even if it's just to throw your slice into an oven and hand it to you.    I'll go back when I'm really hungry, need something in a hurry that doesn't cost a lot, and feel like eating standing up.  On the plus side, it tasted good.  Was hoping for more, though.",

I could not eat all of my two slices. The staff are a little dry, but I don't really blame them. It's hotter than an oven in there and people are rushing in and out. It's very cheap! Probably the cheapest food on the strip, even cheaper than White Castle, and fills you up crazy good! The pizza was  good , it's not the best pizza I've ever had but based on the size, freshness, cost and quickness I'm giving it a four star rating",

    "text": "First of all..The pizza was pretty decent. Just getting that part out of the way.  As for the service, it's the worst I've had in Las Vegas. We paid cash, and I noticed we had been charged for three slices instead of two. When I returned to question the girl at the register, she asked for a receipt...obviously, she hadn't given us one. She said, \"I always give a receipt. So if you don't have one, I can't do anything for you.\" I asked to talk to the manager and she told me he was out, and I would have to wait. This chick obviously underestimated how little patience I have for bulls* and how much patience I have to get my money back. I waited.   The next customer she served didn't get a receipt from her. When I pointed that out, she snapped the receipt out of the register, waves it at the customer, and said, \"do you want this or not?\" The next group ordered three slices and was charged for four.   She finally looked at me and said, \"so do you want your six dollars, or what? I don't understand.\" Ummmm...obviously. I want my six dollars. I don't care to give my money away to some little troll that's over-charging customers so she can pocket the change.   This place needs new staff with better customer service skills if they plan to stay in business. And I would strongly recommend background checks on their employees. Especially if the manager doesn't plan to be around to see what they're doing when they think no one is watching.  I recommend just crossing the street to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. Better pizza, better prices, and no thievery.",

    "text": "Grabbed a few slices at Pin Up Pizza since we were staying at Planet Hollywood, shortly after we arrived on our first night in Vegas.  They were huge slices but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered 3 slices to share between the two of us.  We got pepperoni pizza and a cannoli.  Unfortunately, the pizza tasted overly like garlic and grease.  There is no mention of garlic on the pizza, but it's clearly in the sauce, and a lot of it.  We both ate one slice, because we were hungry, and threw out the other one.  I was excited to try the cannoli but took one bite and spit it out.  The cream inside is flavored with what tasted like orange liqueur, and again, a lot of it.  Cannolis are not traditionally filled with orange liqueur flavored cream, so a heads up before buying would have been nice.  Would not recommend this place to anyone.  We didn't get a chance to try Secret Pizza across the street on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but I'd say it's gotta be better than here.",

And dayummmm that pizza was fiyahh. One slice would have made anybody full but i was so hungry i had to eat 2 slices. It was quite a walk from the joint back to the hotel and along the way people were tryin to buy a slice for 10 bucks each. I would have sold it had i bought 2 whole pizzas but nah i had hungry ppl back at the hotel room.   Oh yea another thing thats a must grab to die for is their garlic knot. U wont be able to go wrong with that. Late night muchies, i suggest pin up pizzas!",

    "text": "During my Little League career I picked up a serious vice. My easily influenced ten-year-old self watched MLB players chomp on chewing tobacco and followed suit by developing a habit for Big League Chew. Bubble gum shredded into strips in a baseball-themed pouch meant to resemble their 18+ counterparts. It would barely last an inning and you'd spend most of it spitting out hot-pink syrup like you'd taken a big bite of flamingo you suddenly regretted. That's kinda what it's like to eat at Pin-up Pizza.   It's called Pin-Up because it tastes like someone nailed your slice to a wall for a calendar year with each topping representing a federal holiday or important birthday. The flavor dissipates almost instantly and you spend the rest of your time chewing on a flavorless mass like an astronaut with a freeze-dried bagel. Paper-thin, minimal amount of sauce and a skinny layer of cheese seemingly limited by a dairy accountant.  The price isn't right. A cheese slice, even in New York, has a ceiling of $2. So why everyone boasts that the softball-sized garlic knots are $3 and the HUGE slices are only $6 is beyond me. Asteroids are HUGE too but I'd rather have my dinosaurs back.   The grandiose nature of Vegas peppers the strip with celebrity-themed establishments like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and Tila Tequila's Stroke Shack that require long waits and little value. It's actually cheaper to buy a 64oz frozen Long Island complete with souvenir \"High Roller\" pimp cup than a nutritious meal on the strip. Which is probably why the South Side of Las Vegas Blvd is a belligerent stampede of prostitutes and panhandlers mixed with the tourists that support them. Be prepared to see more meat hanging off the patrons than the pies, especially late night.  Pin-up at least offers quick, simple and economical (for Vegas) fuel for your gambling fever. Plus there's a certain kitschiness to a larger than life meal you could wrap around your neck like a scarf. Everyone else should head to do-it-yourself Project Pie at the MGM Grand, at least if your creation crashes you only have yourself to blame.",

I don't have high blood pressure but I swear I think my blood pressure went up to 200/150 after attempting to eat that slice. Never again!

I gotta say, even though it blew up on social media and is more of a tourist destination now, they serve a descent slice of pie.   My BF and I split the sausage and peperoni slice with a garlic knot. We waited in about a 5 minute line which wasn't bad because the line went past the front door and down the hall. They heated up the pizza and knot and got us in and out quickly.   I really enjoyed the pizza. The crust was flakey and crispy and the toppings were delish. New go-to for a quick snack while in Vegas. Def check it out.",

    "text": "I came across this gem of a place the first time I visited Las Vegas and I go back every time I'm in town. This is a pick up and go pizza place where you buy by the slice. They have a combo which is a pizza slice, garlic knots and a beer for just under $13. I always get the cheese slice which is about $6.50. They re-heat this huge slice while you wait and it is given to you warm and crispy.  The base is quite thin - so New York style- which I love! The lady that works there is super quick and super friendly. There are free extras like chili flakes, oregano herbs, Parmesan cheese available on the counters.   Please note that there is no place to sit down. You can stand by the counters and eat your pizza. There is counters inside and counters outside as you exit.   I never finish the slice as it's really huge! So technically it's 2 meals in one purchase for me.   Do yourself a favor and try a slice, you won't be disappointed!",

The pizza slices are huge but only have like two toppings on each slice, meaning I only got one pepperoni and 1.5 sausages on my whole slice. The pizza was not even hot, barely warm. It definitely was disappointing. The garlic knot was not special. The only thing satisfying was the iced soda because of the Vegas heat.",

    "text": "We saw this place featured on insider food so we decided to check it out. They featured huge slices of pizza. It is located outside of the miracle mile shops in between planet Hollywood hotel and casino.   When we got there, there was a line out the door, so we knew it had to be good. I came to learn there was only one girl behind the counter handling everyone. She handled herself pretty well considering the crowd. Hopefully this was a short staff day and not a normal thing. The line could have gone way faster if there were two ppl taking orders.   They were also out of garlic knots until later that night so some ppl were disappointed. I didn't really care about them though. The only thing is the pizzas were big but not as big as the ones featured on insider food. I was greedy and selected the biggest one they had from the slices. You can also order a whole pizza if you want.   I got the margarita pizza. I liked their spin on it and the sauce the tomatoes was in was delicious. It was very flavorful. I had her reheat my slice to crispy and it was perfect. I was satisfied with my visit.",

They had seven kinds to choose from but not all were available when we were there. I was actually looking forward to trying the prosciutto and arugula, but they didn't have it, so I settled for the chicken and spinach. It was very busy but yet the server kept her cool. Service was super fast, so don't expect too much. The shop had an outdoor area for patrons but it was really messy: empty beer bottles, leftover crusts, dirty napkins, etc.   I liked how the crust was not too thick. I would say I had a generous amount of chicken and spinach on my pizza. However, I thought the flavour was lacking overall. It was only flavourful where the chicken and spinach was, so in other areas, it was bland. For $7 USD, I though it was a little expensive when I converted back to canadian, which was about 9 bucks. Was this pizza really worth $9 bucks? I didn't think so. But at that time of the night, it was a good alternative to burgers and fries.",

There was a line out the door at 2am.. the line moves fast.. pizzas are pre-made and slices are  thrown in the oven as you order and heated up giving the crust a nice crunch  I had the spinach & chicken .. crust was really good! Toppings were plentiful .. the bf had the big meat slice and he also commented on the crust be really good .. ($7/each).. the slices are huge..   The service was fast and the cashier knew how to work the line.. friendly & efficient!   You take it to go or you stand outside and chow down.. would definitely recommend to someone looking for cheap good eats on the strip.. if you need table service or a place to sit down go somewhere else",

First of all, the pictures don't do it justice...the slices are HUGE. The pizza is actually good as well, they have several varieties for you. I opted for the All Meat Slice and it hits the spot. Very generous with the amounts of toppings and cheese. They heat up your slice in the oven for you so it's served hot and fresh! Well worth the $6-$7 price! And let's be honest, you won't find many options on the Strip for under $10...  Located outdoors right in front of the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile entrances, it is very easy to find. It's open until 4am and is a popular late night spot but the lines move a whole lot quicker then Secret Pizza at Cosmo. Sadly, they were out of garlic knots when I went around 1am. But will have to try next time!  If you have been drinking and are in the Southern area of the Strip, definitely grab a slice from Pin Up...trust me! Best DRUNCHIES ever and you'll feel a whole lot better in the AM!  Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice? They will cut it in half for you...just ask! One slice is definitely more than enough for most people!",

Itsy bitsy place with barely a seat...but what an experience! Enormous pizzas, hand tossed readymade and warmed up for you. There's a menu with all the combos you can choose and it's a pretty fast moving line. The lady grabs what you want, heats it up and gets your drink. We watched the guy toss a pizza and make them as pizzas we gobbled up. Got the cheese and a margarita with a garlic knot and drinks. I'd skip the knots, they aren't that flavorful. Stepped outside and tried to finish the largest slice I've eaten!!! The boxes are perfect for taking away and they've got the biggest crushed chili dispenser you ever did see. Pictures of beautiful women cover the walls t this family owned place and it's totally worth a stop!",

They have combo for $10.25 or $12.75 slice, knot soda or beer. They sell by the slice $6-7 The slices are big, yea but did not appear as big as advertised. One slice is about 2 slices.

I'm impressed with how the girls stay calm and move the line quick. Dealing with so many tourists and locals isn't very easy. I go to the strip just to eat this pizza! Good thing planet Hollywood has free parking.",

    "text": "Ok, I see a lot of positive reviews for this joint. My guess is that these people were drunk while \"enjoying\" their slice and their memory is a bit fuzzy.  Heck, I've been 3 sheets to the wind while enjoying my gourmet jack in the box and thought it was the best food in the world. It happens.   But here is an honest review from a sober fat guy. The line will be long. Your eyes will bulge as you see the size of the slices. $7 for a GIANT slice seems like one hell of a deal. You anticipate the greezy thin crust floppy slice entering your mouth.  You can't wait for this gut buster. You wait.  Then...you get your slice.  I gotta tell you, this joint has mastered the art of putting just enough sauce and cheese on their pizza to give it the appearance of a legitimate slice of pizza. It's quite impressive actually. They must practice. It's down to an art.  You see, the crust was soggy/under done, so rather than feed the diabetes with all that bread, I figured I'd just eat the \"toppings.\"   To my dismay, the layer of cheese is thinner than that tracing paper you had when you were in grade school. The sauce they use must get absorbed into the soggy crust because after \"scraping\" through, nothing red underneath.   There are a few pepperonis on top. Nothing special.   Bottom line, soggy, no cheese, no sauce, no flavor. If you're drunk, have at It! Otherwise you're better off at that Roman joint.",

The Margherita pizza did not use any tomato sauce. The pizza was topped with some dollops of baked mozzarella and some cherry tomatoes crushed with basil. Making a good sauceless pizza is hard. Pin Up's cherry tomatoes gave you a tangy mouthful so the lack of sauce did not feel acute.   This place is small and quirky. I loved that the servers are dressed up in pin up outfits. The slices are huge!! The length is that of 2 tv remotes. For this size and decent quality, the price of $6.50 is bang for your buck. If in Vegas, I would definitely come back again.",

Just your average tasty pizza that is not overpowered by cheese. The down side I had is that it did not look appetizing when I walked through the door. All of the pizza was cold from being out on display. When you order a slice, they just pick up a slice and stick it in the oven to warm it up. It is not a fresh pizza, so being in Vegas, I would recommend eating here for a snack and not a meal. The price was a little over the top but it is Vegas so I am not surprised.",

I couldn't even finish the Betty P. deal of pizza, a garlic knot, and a drink, and I'm a pretty big eater. The only downside is no seating, but it's just one of those places where you go with it, prop your elbows up on the bar, and cover your face in greasy goodness. If you're staying in Planet Hollywood and don't want to venture out to find someplace to eat late, this is a good bet.   The woman working the evening I visited was super pleasant as well and told us they get really busy after people leave the clubs. So if you're visiting late at night, expect a little bit of a wait (and probably a lot of good people watching).",

Saw how huge the slices were so my husband & I thought we would try it. When we got there line was long but moving kinda fast. There were only 2 girls & 1 guy making the huge pizza. One girl was re warming yes I said rewarming so no not fresh who knows how long the slices have been sitting under heat lamps. The other girl was working the register. She. Was really sweet. How ever the girl that was rewarming ppls slices in the oven she seemed very unhappy to b there just attitude after attitude. But whatever as long as I gets pizza who cares. We all work we all have bad days @ times. However since pizza wasn't fresh & had to b rewarmed didn't taste all that. It was good but not all that others made it out to be. All in all if ur drunk & in the area. I guess.",

Nah, the pizza wasn't that good, it was HUGE, but also almost $7 for one slice, so not worth it.  The crust was like cardboard, the sauce was just ok, nothing to write home about. The girl behind the counter was nice to us, but I did witness an altercation between her and another customer, he must have said it was cold or something wasn't right because she ripped the plate out of his hand and forcefully threw it into a trash can behind her and then not so nicely shoved another plate with a slice on it at him.  I would not go out of my way to go here again, unless I was so intoxicated that I couldn't make it to another restaurant and even then, I might just try to go somewhere else anyways.",

Pin-up Pizza did not disappoint; it was very good and 1 piece was perfect for each of us. The slices here are HUGE; more like 2.5 slices of a regular pizza. I got a slice of cheese and it was I think a little over $6; you'll pay more when you start adding toppings.  You can get to this place from the strip or you can get to it from the sports bar in Planet Hollywood. There are no tables inside; it's just a counter where you order, however, I noticed a couple tables out in front of this place. We've visited Planet Hollywood many times and I can't believe it took so long to go to this place... it'll definitely be a go-to spot for us now. It's perfect, order a slice and take it back to the bar for a quick dinner while getting your gamble on. Yum yum!",

I also expected the people working there to be in a rockabilly/greaser get up, but to no avail.  I wouldn't go there again, but I guess it's worth a 1 time experience.  I just expected a LOT more for Pin-Up Pizza and all the good reviews. My girlfriend, being highly influenced by pin-up and alternative style, and being from New York, and loving thin crust (I like thicker, and deep dish, but good pizza is good pizza)... She was also as disappointed as I was.",

    "text": "What an awful experience.   The inside is about 20 feet long.  It is a door on one end that goes into the casino one in the middle that is the entrance and the other end is the exit.  I felt like I was in someone's way the whole time.  The chick behind the counter was busy chatting to another employee about a text message.  My husband ordered a combo with an extra slice of pizza.  She asked if it was here or to go.  I don't know why they don't just put it in a box.  She smacked our slices on plates smaller than the pizza and stared at us.  I said didnt he order me a soda?  She said i dont know.  Well he did because he ordered a combo with an extra slice.  So then i get my mountain dew and garlic knot (which she just dumped on top of my pizza) and my husband asks for a glass of water.  She made an awful face and made a glass of water.  So then we paid for a second time since we only paid for the pizza the first time.  There is nowhere to sit inside the casino and nothing outside but a stainless steel counter with no seats.  Since I am not a sea gull we had to walk with our giant flopping slices of pizza through the casino and out into the mall to find a table to sit at.  The pizza was nothing special.  I do not recommend going here for any reason.  It was a terrible experience.",

I'm sorry this is not earl of pizza. We could see the pizza was fully cooked. Ruby the manager and the two servers working the line were completely rude and dismissive. They said we could get sick if they served us pizza off the line with out reheating it in the oven. Actually the first girl said meat pizza had to go back in because the meat was raw (never saw raw pepperoni before). There is nothing btw in raw pizza dough that would make u sick. The operation was horribly inefficient. Why would you par cook pizza anyway when you have a line. I have never heard of this ever in a pizza by the slice restaurant. Awful. Rude.",

The only bad thing i have to say about the place is that there is no seating. At all. However, they did let us sit in the casino bar area, which is accessible via a short hall on the right.

    "text": "After climbing the rather steep street-walk-over-bridge stairs from The Cosmopolitan, I was needing some food. My reservation at Nobu was three hours away and I didn't think I was going to make it without grabbing a bite somewhere. Letting my hunger drive my instincts in this new geography, I ended up at Pin Up Pizza, which is just a few feet from the street-walk-over-bridge stairs.   Here's the thing that is great about this stop: every vacation should have high and low elements-- and, if you are prepared for it, this is the low end. Dinner at Nobu and $6 pizza, within hours of each other, seem to balance my Las Vegas preferences perfectly. So, I thought this was a good sign. Then, I took a good look around... Pin Up Pizza had cashiers in child-sized, dirty red sweaters and there were A LOT of drunk dudes. The pizza-making man couldn't seem to get ahead of orders and blank pizza pans are the ultimate sadness trigger for inhibreated bros.  The Yelp reviews looked consistent enough and I was hungry, so I ordered anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. At $6, my margherita pizza slice was twice the size of my head and tasted pretty good. I ordered the margherita because there were only two pizza topping options when I got up there.   With fake show girls taking pictures with anyone and everyone inches from where I was trying to stuff down a disproportionately-sized slice, I knew I needed to head out quickly. This is not a place that I would intentionally stop, but is a place that I would categorize as In-Case-of-Emergency-Break-Glass-and-Order-the-Pizza.",

They run about $1 dollar plus tax.   The options for beers are just ehh, nothing fancy or something I might like/order so I opted for a soda.   There are NO chairs so expect to stand either inside the location or outside and share a tight counter/ space with other customers.   The counter faces the cosmopolitan hotel and Las Vegas strip so @ least you'll have a decent view.",

The pizza is HUGE! I couldn't finish it though; it was good but a little too oily and salty for my taste. I will definitely be back for the garlic knots though, they also sell them 4 for $3!",

    "text": "Sad. I wanted this place to be great. I wanted a piece of pizza that reminded me of good old New York. But it didn't do so. Let me say presentation is key, and they definitely had that down. I can only say it was a sight to see, after a short wait in a long line, I was greeted by an what was expected to be not so friendly tatted up lady. She wasn't mean, you could just tell she was over worked. I placed my order and my buddy placed his. I asked to have one slice cut in half and she said nope. If I do it for you I have to do it for everyone. Guess what? I got it. Place was super busy and they sell giant slices at a more then fair price. Own emu get a concession myself I tell my customers we are t allowed to have knives they don't trust us with them. Nope everything mentioned above was ok. The pizza plain cheese was split between me and a friend and another friend who had his own piece. 3 of us in the pizza business all different took one bite and trashed it. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. We all agreed the prices which were 6.00 for cheese and 7 for toppings were CHEAP. Easily could be 8 and 9 and they wouldn't have a complaint. But that's a one and done tourist who's never coming back. Anything wrong with that? Nope just not a killer slice. Dough not crispy, sauce was straight out of can with no spice. Cheese was quality, but just didn't come together the way a slice should. No need to worry this place will survive. 1400+ pieces a day well over 10k a day. If the rent is 100k a month they are still doing great. Labor from what we saw was about 5%. Plenty of profit. Just not a good product.",

They are only half cooked so that when warmed up they are cooked perfectly which is a great technique. Oddly, I asked them not to warm up the pizza (which they advised against) but it was still very good! Great sauce flavor, nice big slice, and non-rubbery cheese - I don't know if I'd go again late at night just because the line was so long, but definitely would visit again during the day or another time to avoid the rush!",

Let's just say it was quite different then what I saw in the video on the story. The pizza was dry and sitting in a glass case where we could pick a slice. Then they put it in the oven to nuke it a bit. Was not appealing. It was a stand up, bar type, very small, indoor/outdoor area to eat in. No forks for their huge slices of pizza (what they're known for) no lids or straws for their drinks. And the pizza was tasteless! Overall, the hype from the story that was on them was completely wrong ... or they fell off! JS Plus, staff was very spunky like they showed and advertise with the name \"Pin up pizza\"!!",

The online site and review sites show a nice sit down environment like a full service restaurant, but instead it's a 'walk into this tiny storefront, order and there may be some seating available in the sports gambling area of Planet Hollywood, or just eat in front of the hot sweltering window... (No thank you).  Don't get me wrong, that area was chill and I could totally nap in those comfy chairs, but it's not the experience I was looking for.   The ingredients are cheap. There's much better and even worse pies to ingest in Vegas, but with lunch deals under $9-10... you really can't beat it.   I don't think I would return if it's still here when I get back to Vegas, but....   A-OK",

    "text": "So I first saw Pin Up Pizza when one of their videos went viral. The biggest (15\") pizza slices in America? Count me in!  ======== LOCATION ========  Located on the Vegas strip, the front entrance is directly off of Las Vegas Blvd on the strip, the back entrance is in Planet Hollywood. It's super narrow and you can't eat inside really but there's a ton of tables and seats in Planet Hollywood about 20 feet from the back entrance.  ======== THE FOOD ========  ~ CHICKEN & SPINACH SLICE - I got this late night and it was cold but it was still pretty good. Probably would've been a 5* if it was warm. (4/5)  ~ GARLIC KNOT - I saw people rave about it and it looked pretty good but it was merely average. Not enough garlic or salt flavor. Definitely needs marinara or ranch to mask the lack of flavor. Texture wise it was decent. (3/5)  ~ MEAT SLICE - It had pepperoni, a large sliced sausage and your normal ground sausage. It was nothing special. (2/5)  ============== FINAL THOUGHTS ==============  Is it amazingly delicious pizza? No. Is it a solid pizza and helluva value? Yes.  You get 15-inches for $7! Where else can you get that in Vegas? -insert joke here-  But seriously it's a solid value. One slice is like 3-4 slices and will fill you up.   Take advantage of the Parmesan Cheese and Red Pepper shakers on the wall across from the register. There's also some Green Tabasco Pepper Sauce too. It's not the best but it's solid so I'll be back.",

The crust is very thin so you don't feel overly full after eating a slice of Pin-Up Pizza and it is served fairly hot. I tried the Margherita pizza and it was very yummy. They offer two different meal options - one with a slice of pizza, a soft drink and a garlic knot and the other with a slice of pizza, beer and a garlic knot. Further, they are open till very late so it's perfect if you are walking back to the hotel hungry after the club! There is no area for sitting but they have high tables/bar outside and inside where you can just stand and eat your pizza. They also offer a box for the pizza slice if you want to get it to-go. Keep in mind - this is fast food and it is good for being fast food. I recommend you give Pin-Up Pizza a try!",

They make very large pizzas and when you order they reheat it in the oven. Very crispy and large slices. The garlic knots were quite good and a decent size as well. The marinara was good just a small container for .75. The deal for a beer, pizza and knot was about $12.75 which isn't too bad considering the amount you get. The margarita pizza was good just the tomatoes were pretty tart. The pepperoni was good just greasy but what pepperoni pizza isn't? They offer red pepper flakes and garlic salt to put on top.  The downfall, other than the woman with no personality, is there is no where to sit. Standing room only and outside they have a very small area that is also standing.",

    "text": "If you happen to be on the strip near Planet Hollywood, and need a filling slice of pizza, Pin-Up Pizza is a great choice. There is access from the sports book within PH or the main entrance from the strip between main entrances to PH/Miracle Mile.   Make sure you've worked up a bit of an appetite (drunken or not) because these slices are no joke. They don't even fit on the plate so plan on taking a few immediate bites of gooey cheese (watch out, it's probably hot!) or your server may even fold the pizza tip over on itself to avoid excess pizza issues. The $7 price point may seem high, but one slice is equivalent to at least two regular slices anywhere else!  Their pizza is best right out of the oven, so I wouldn't recommend trying to save it for later. Once you order, they throw your slice right into the oven, which is why there is usually a bit of a line. Everyone walks out with a freshly warmed slice of pizza.  Out of a handful of visits here, I've tried the pepperoni, prosciutto and arugula, and margherita. The prosciutto and arugula is probably the most different of them all. The arugula, cherry tomatoes, and sauce are added after the pizza is warmed. The toppings are plentiful and this one can get a little messy. Pancetta and mushroom has become my go to. The combo of fatty pancetta and mushroom is unbeatable and creates a well balanced, simply delicious pizza.   Earl's used to be my favorite cheap eat on the strip, but Pin-Up Pizza makes me forget that Earl's is only a few more steps away. Plus, my husband never lets me skip an opportunity to come here.",

It's literally only large enough for a small line to form inside. You order your pizza, pay, and slide on down to the other end of the tiny room to retrieve your order.   My boyfriend and his family ordered a slice of pepperoni per person, while I opted to go for 2 garlic knots. The food was served nice and hot, and even though it was reheated technically, it still was delicious. We took it back to the Bellagio and enjoyed it there where it was still pretty warm. The pizza is a thin crust of sorts and definitely a gigantic piece. The cheesy was melty and the tomato sauce evenly distributed throughout the slice. The garlic knots were fantastic, and it didn't even need marinara. Fluffy, soft, garlicky, and amazing.   A quick, delicious munchies spot. The pricing is fair for both quality and size. Service was speedy and courteous. Not a bad place to check out.",

Well, that could be False since I have never been to New York to enjoy their pizza but that is another story for another time.   Anyways, back to this location. It is very small shop and can only hold a few people at a time while waiting for your food. There is a counter to eat inside and a counter to eat outside. The lady that was working the counter was very quick and talented. You know this place is good when there is a long time out the door but she took the orders of ~10 people at a time since she will use up all the space in the pizza oven. There is a line, yes, but it will be a quick line. Besides...I would rather wait in line with other people so I know the food is good....verses no line where I question the food is good or bad.   There are many different times of flavors besides your traditional pepperoni, or sausage, or cheese. I got the pancetta and mushroom and it was good. My wife got the prosciutto and arugula and she enjoyed it. There was a drizzle of balsamic glaze (I think) on top.   Overall, if I am ever to return to this place, I will return here.",

    "text": "I stayed at Planet Hollywood from July 7th to July 9th and found Pin Up Pizza to be one of the more affordable dining options.  $23.27 was enough to get two large slices of pizza, two garlic knots, and two sodas.  Each slice was boxed individually and the corresponding garlic knot was placed in the same box as the slice.  The sodas were poured into plastic cups but lids and straws were not provided.  Although environmentally conscious, this made it more challenging to carry all of the items back to the room without spilling the drinks.  The food was hot and very tasty.  Pin Up Pizza was mostly a carry-out spot with only a little standing room outside and no seating.  The slices were at least twice the size (if not more) than the slices you would find at a major chain pizza place.  I saw the food go right in the oven while I was waiting in line and an employee was stretching dough nearby.",

    "text": "It seems so obvious.  In fact, I'm surprised that it hadn't happened sooner.  Secret Pizza in Cosmo, Five50 in Aria, New York Pizzeria in New York New York, Pin-Up Pizza...it's almost like folks suddenly realized it could be profitable to sell pizzas by the slice along the Strip.  I mean, it's not like there are a lot of folks out there looking for a (relatively) cheap meal/snack or some post-clubbing/drinking/gambling eats.  But hey, better late than never!  Located on the street level of Planet Hollywood on The Strip, Pin-Up Pizza features the same New York-style slices as the likes of Secret Pizza and New York Pizzeria, but their range of pies is a bit more unique than their competitors'.  Of their seven different offerings (Cheese, Pepperoni, Big Meat, Margherita, Chicken & Spinach, Prosciutto & Arugula, and Pancetta & Mushroom), I opted to get a slice of their CHICKEN & SPINACH ($7) as it looked a bit more appealing than the rest.  After they warmed it up in their oven, the first thing that struck me about my slice was how large it was.  Their menu isn't wrong about how they have big slices - mine was spilling off the plate!  What's more, I really the white sauce underneath all that cheese and how they didn't skimp on the toppings.  The only (slight) bummer for me was the crust.  Not bad by any means, but I wish it was a little softer/chewier and that it had a little more flavor to it.  Otherwise, this was a very solid slice!  Given all of the fast food joints that are within a short walk from Pin-Up Pizza (McDonald's, Popeye's, Panda Express, everything in Miracle Mile, etc.), there are plenty of alternatives for some cheap eats.  However, as far as late night slices go, Pin-Up is a solid choice that's literally on The Strip (doesn't require going into the hotel for) and at a decent price, considering how large the slice is for your money.",

That said, go for the meat varieties if you are not diet restricted.  The crust has a good chew, and it is a good NY style slice.  This is not the place for extra cheese, or deep dish, so be warned.  The line moves fast, and they finish/re-heat the slices on demand.  My only real complaints are that seating is very limited, and they don't have boxes for take out.  I suggest popping into PH and finding a seat in the closest lounge, rather than standing around outside choking down a slice you should really take your time with.",

    "text": "Not bad not bad. So I'm a huge Chicago deep dish fan, but this New York style from this place is pretty good. I personally just got the cheese pizza slice and it was really good. The crust wasn't burnt, the cheese was good, and I finished the whole thing. My boyfriend got the pepperoni. We thought it was regular but it ended up being spicy pepperoni. Not a huge different but we didn't notice it and had to take a few out. That also made his pizza like really greasy. But overall it was good. The pizza slice is huge so only get one and see if you finish it or not. To me it was kinda easy to finish because I only got cheese and I was also pretty hungry so yeah haha.   So this place is right in front of the miracle shops and when I pass by I always always see a huge line and sometimes out the door. But we went at 10:30pm and there was no line. I thought it was closed. I was so shocked. But like right after we ordered a few more people started coming in and it got busy again. So I guess we just got lucky.  It is a small place so not good for big crowds. It is cramped inside but there is a little balcony area outside to stand up, eat, and people watch so that's not a bad option either.   Would I come here again? If the line is short then yes!",

I've been twice now and lines are always pretty long but for the most part they help people fast to get the line moving. Staff was pretty friendly but they are working to move fast the line. The pizza is pretty much basic pizza not to many customizing options but the pizza was very tasty and the slice was just as pictures show. I think that was the excitement the big slices haha but definitely worth it. It's a very small space and they don't have a-lot of seating options so it is more a grab and go place. They have an entrance thats on Las Vegas blvd and thru the casino but seems like they keep the line organized so theres no confusion with people coming in from different sides. Thanks again ,will keep this place in mind next time i find myself on the strip!",

Go tos were peperoni, loved the mushroom bacon one, big meat was great, and the white cheese one with spinach and chicken.  YUM!!!  So good, love the spice of the pepperoni, really unique and packs a nice bite.

When we arrived to the area where Pin-Up Pizza was, a girl caught our eye trying to eat a gigantic slice of pizza and we couldn't believe our eyes. As we got closer, we found the source and we knew that we HAD to stop by here.   A lot of the times we stopped by there would be a huge line up that we never wanted to stand in. One late night a friend and I were making a quick Walgreens run. Since we were in the area, we thought to check out to see if there was a line up at Pin-Up Pizza and there wasn't, it was maybe around 1-2am. I ordered a Big Meat slice and my friend got a Panchetta and Mushroom slice. The stand up patio/eating area was also quite empty so we decided to stand and eat our slices there.  The pizzas were thin-crusted and had an evenly flat layer of toppings. It wasn't your normal, tower full of meat pizza, but that's the trade off for such a large slice. A little bit on the saltier side for me, but otherwise delicious. Pretty oily because of all the meat that I had but that was expected. Piping hot because they will reheat your slices for you.   I'd like to try more flavours before giving it a better rating. A great place for a quick, huge snack.",

It was like some pizza ecstasy or something. Take another bite and your like I can't stop eating this. Now folks, this is how good pizza suppose to be like.

It is located inside Planet Hollywood but can seen by the strip, behind Ringers restaurant which is across from Earl of Sandwich. It is a small shop with stand up tables with a nice view of the strip. If you are just ordering slices (not combos), you can eat inside Ringers.   The pizza is very good and a great deal for being on the strip. Each slice is huge! They are 15\" long. I tried the Margherita pizza and it was very delicious! The tomatoes are seasoned well and go well with the mozzarella. The Sandra Dee combo is the way to go!! You get any slice of pizza, a garlic knot (YUUUUM), and drink, all for $9.50. Try it out if you're close by!",

We ordered a straight up cheese slice and wow...sooo tasty!!

It is good, if you need a quick bite to eat or are in a hurry. Other than that, unless you want a novelty slice of pizza, I would go somewhere else.  There is no seating, so you either can eat at the standing counter, which is usually packed, or outside.   There is a decent selection of toppings, but the taste is mediocre. It wasn't anything I was raving about when I came home.    Also I was kind of confused with the name of the shop. Since, it is called pin up pizza, it is decorated in past pin up girls. However, I do not think the way the shop is set up as grab and go pizza that the theme makes much sense. Before we ate here I thought it was a pizza place where the waitresses were dressed up as pinup girls. Since it is Vegas, I was expecting over the top. Instead it is just a quick stop decorated in pinups of the past.",

    "text": "Decent pizza that makes up for quality with quantity. You need to eat the pizza here with a fork and a knife... or find a way to finesse a bite without the pizza falling apart. They're huge, but a huge part of it is a massive crust. Pro tip: season your pizza by getting drunk during the evening. It helps the pizza taste a little better. The margherita pizza was the best and that's coming from someone who likes pepperoni and sausage.  So why the one star? The service.  One morning before heading out to the river, my girlfriend went up to the counter to ask when they would open. There were 3 guys behind the counter, each facing the glass, heads down. My girlfriend said excuse me three times. Not once did anyone acknowledge her. I was standing about 6-7 feet away and I could hear her clearly.  Another example of poor service was when I got back one night from the river. I stood in line underneath the \"order here\" sign. The guy making pizza was doing his own thing. Then another guy came out to work on other orders. No one said a word. Other people began to wonder where to order. At that moment, someone walked up to the register and began ordering, even though other people, including myself were waiting at the \"order here\" sign first. I asked where we should order and finally they said I would be next.  The hours of operation on yelp are also incorrect. I believe they close at 10 PM as of July 2017. Anyway, the poor service seems to be a common topic amongst customers. I was able to experience it myself.",

They ask you for your selection then they warm it up for you in the oven. Very friendly staff. Cool to see the chef kneading the dough and making the pizza right there behind the glass. Kind of on the pricey side for one slice ($7) I went because I saw a video on Facebook and it was conveniently located in the same building as my hotel. They have a standing section that you can set your pizza down at and stand and eat. Good stop for a quick bite to eat after the bars. They close at 4 am.",

The slice on its own is big enough to share, but I don't share food...and I ate the whole slice by myself (always do). A slice on its own is about $7, I would totally recommend the combo if you have a big appetite because it comes with a soda/beer and a garlic knot which is just as amazing at the pizza. There's a counter inside and outside of the place where you can enjoy your pizza with cheese, chili flakes, and hot sauces on the side.",

    "text": "Sorry, I prefer Secret Pizza. I like how Pin Up has some more unique pies available without requiring a special order (chicken and spinach, potato-prosciutto-mushroom), and the slices are huge enough to feed two, and make a cheap Strip meal... but the product itself just isn't something I'd come back for. Pizza slice didn't have much flavor in the toppings or crust, maybe I'd have better luck sticking to the classic pepperoni?   I also disliked that the base of the pie was covered in tons of little crumbs that looked like pepper(?) and made a huge mess on my hands as I ate. Grab napkins if you take your order to go. Counter staff were dressed in keeping with the pin up theme, but the cold, unfriendly attitude was something I could do without.   TIP:  I think the only way to get to it is from the exterior along the Strip. Get here from Planet Hollywood parking garage by taking the Miracle Mile shops to the right, follow signage to exit for the Strip, and take an immediate right.",

If you must take it home, be warned, you will need the entire trunk/cargo section to fit the pizza. After getting over the size factor, the taste was okay. I've had better New York style pizzas and better pizzas in general. We had the pepperoni. The sauce was bland and the cheese was barely noticeable. The service was nice enough and you get to see them make the pizza, but taste is what ultimately matters. If you are looking for better tasting pizza along the strip, I would suggest avoiding this place. Taste not size is what matters.",

We heard about this place through a couple of mutual friends and we decided to give it a try. Located near Planet Hollywood this restaurant offers giant slices of pizza!   I ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza. Which with a combo included a drink and garlic bread. The crust on the pizza is thin (my favorite kind of crust) and each bite had the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. The only downside to this place it that they don't really have a large enough seating area so be prepared to stand and eat if you choose to stay there.   Other than that a solid 4/5 stars definitely get your money's worth and hunger satisfied!",

The slices are definitely larger than life even bigger than the plate that they serve it on. One slice was more than enough for at least two people, plus their garlic knots are just out of this world. The garlic knots almost resemble a cinnamon roll.  We tried the pepperoni pizza and the chicken and spinach flavored pizzas tonight. The pepperoni was pretty simple but yet flavorful with a little bit of garlic sprinkled on top. The chicken and spinach was probably my favorite filled with chunks of grilled chicken and spinach spread throughout the pizza and a sprinkling of garlic powder as well. You could buy sauces on the side as well as the garlic knots, but we did not venture that far this evening. This place is definitely a must try while on the strip.",

We came in mid-afternoon and it wasn't busy yet (thankfully!) This spot tends to get heavy foot traffic at night when most places are closed; so it is a plus that it's open until 4am!   Hope to try the cannoli and garlic knots next time!",

Seriously, if you blink, you'll miss it (which we did) it's in a construction area, and it's really small. There are 2 standing tables outside, and a standing counter inside. It was pretty crowded with day drinkers, and we had our whole clan with us. We sat our 6yr old on the counter so he didn't get trampled.   We chose the big meat, 2 cheese, pepperoni, and a chicken and spinach. Yes, the slices are HUGE! The pizzas in the window are the biggest I've seen in my life.. But they were just alright. I did enjoy the sweetness of the crust - it was soft and doughy. Like freshly baked bread. I think I was looking for explosive flavor - more grease, more sauce, more everything.",

And did I mention the slices are huuuge?   I ordered the combo with a pizza slice, garlic knot & drink. The garlic knot is pre-made then goes into the oven to get golden and the butter melts all over. The knot itself is soft and full of parmesan and garlic flavors.   I got a margherita pizza slice and holy crap! Amazingly juicy cherry tomatoes, the fresh mozzarella is ooey-gooey amazing and I think there's some balsamic adding a lil punch of acidity to the bites. Crust is thin and crispy on the bottom. Ugh. So good!",

I got the combo with meat lovers slice and it was pretty good! Not the best I've had but it was good, Those knots are delicious. I also ordered the cannoli which I didn't like, it had pieces of oranges in it giving it a citrusy flavor which isn't something I like in a cannoli.   It's not a sit down restaurant, more of a Grab and go place. They do have counters inside but it gets busy at certain times so it wouldn't be the most comfortable place to eat, better off eating outside or in the connected sports bar.  I would come again for the filling meal and those garlic knots!!!",

But boy was I disappointed and so were my FOUR KIDS that I dragged to get it! They walked a mile (a mile as you know is equivalent to 15 to a 7 year old) in 100 degree heat from our hotel for this pizza that I hyped up the whole time driving here from LA only to find that there is NO SEATING and PARMESAN CHEESE packets. WTH?! The video that I saw on Facebook totally showed a woman sitting and eating her pizza!!! Anyway, pizza is OK at best...we got the normal pepperoni and cheese pizza and honestly, taste wise there's better pizza out there...price is fair though!",

The biggest disappointment was the menu listed on yelp is outdated by two years! They lacked veggie options, and their margarita pizza was just tomatoes (although heirloom cherry tomatoes were used) and sliced mozzarella with no tomato sauce leaving areas of the pie with no ingredients- and on a large slice it's a lot of empty space. The pizza was so salty we couldn't even finish our slices and we needed to drink lots of water after. Even writing this review after the facts my tongue and lips are tingling just due to the amount of salt used. I would never recommend this place and if someone wanted a slice I would recommend Sbarro inside of Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "I have been to Pin Up Pizza a few times now, and I love it. It's excellent.   A slice of pepperoni is $6.75, and it's worth every penny. The slices are fresh, and they're heated in the oven while you pay, so they're always hot. Lots of flavor. They're huge slices. You're really getting double the slice of a chain slice for the same price. For the price, compared to other eateries in Vegas, it's a really good deal. A combo deal with a garlic knot and a soda is about $10 plus tax, and a couple bucks more if you want a beer. Wait times are minimal and the service is excellent. Be prepared though. It's small inside and draws a large crowd, and the staff takes many orders at once. Please be considerate, pay attention when called on, keep the line moving smoothly, and tip the staff as you leave. They do a great job.   The space to dine in or outside on the strip is very limited. No chairs. There is a little more room outside, where I like to eat. You can people watch as you eat, which is always fun and entertaining. But if you have a large group of people, you might be better served to get your pizza to go. If one person is paying, you may want to have that person go inside while the rest of the group waits outside.   Pro tip: Total Rewards credits are accepted here, so if you're gambling at a Caesar's property, you can use your comps here with no hassles.   If you're looking for an excellent, quality slice of pizza and/or want a quick snack while on the strip, Pin Up Pizza is highly recommended. I just moved here a few weeks ago and imagine I'll be eating here quite often. You won't be disappointed.",

Pin Up Pizza is delicious, fast, convenient, and a good value. While Secret Pizza (Cosmo) and Pop Up (MGM) are good this place is a solid 1 star above.  One slice will easily satisfy you for lunch or a quick dinner. Entrance off the strip or from the PH sports book. Do yourself a favor and stop by next time your in town, this place will definitely steal some of the Earl of Sandwich crowd (and that is very hard to do).",

I said I have sauce on my pizza but she said they don't have any. I told her I did not want the knot and she said they already made it and it's good without the sauce.

One reason I chose it was because they sell by the slice & since I can be indecisive I like to get 2 different slices, so.. 1) they didn't have much variety at all 2) not many specialty pieces- very basic 3) the margerita shouldn't even be called margerita, they made it their own way with grape tomatoes, no basil, no tomato sauce 4) my husband got a sausage, ricotta piece & there was so little ricotta  I highly recommend the pizza place in the New York hotel, the one on the second floor..or 800 degrees! Both delicious!!",

I went with about 8 people including myself. There were only about 10 people ahead of us when we got there.  I waited in line with about 5 of my friends in front of me.  I get to the register and I state that I wanted to order a slice of cheese and one garlic knot. The girl at the cash register states to me that I have to wait in line before I order... What!? I waited in line for like 5 minutes. She said that I wasn't in line.  After I tell her that I waited in line just like everyone else, she says that I was supposed to put in my order with the other guy. There is a guy cooking the pizzas and pulling them out of the oven. I guess he goes down the line and asks what people want to order.   Well he states that he never saw me in line. I laughed! I am 6'4\" and you didn't see me? Come on now. I was literally the biggest person in there...LITERALLY!  After I said that, the girl told me that she would give me what I wanted to order for free. I turned it down...really didn't want a slice of pizza that I'm pretty sure would of gotten spit on.  The guy behind the counter gets mad because I said one cuss word in there. I apologized for saying it..but then he gets loud and says \"I have the right to refuse service to you!!!\"    I laughed and yelled back to him...\"DOG! You already refused service to me..what's next!?\"   The girl behind laughed and said, \"touche, touche...\"",

I'd been telling my honey all night that I needed to get something sweet and they got the bill with the salami trio slice and cannoli.  Kinda bummed that they didn't have the spinach and chicken slice available, they said that they literally ran out of dough.  The salami trio was really tasty and original with peppercinis and different kinds of salami.   They also had beer and beer-a-ritas to go.  I got a straw-ber-ita for $6.50, 25 oz, 8% alcohol.    However, the cannoli was Amazeballs!  I think it was pistachio, I have no idea.  All I know is it was reminiscent of cheesecake and will likely haunt me at the most inconvenient times.  Craveable.  I dare say I may go back there tomorrow for another.  We will be here for a few nights after all.",

The slices are huge and thin, looking like NY style pizza. They heated up a slice of pepperoni, a slice of margherita, and a garlic knot for me. But it was dry and tough. I'll give it another chance but it wasn't impressive at all.",

    "text": "I was here last night at approximately 2:30a with some friends of mine. We chose this place as a late night fix, after a less than stellar night out on the town. Located in the front of Planet Hollywood and right on the strip, we stood on a line no longer than five minutes which was amazing, considering how hungry we were!   They have a few choices as far as pizza & their toppings are concerned. However, the few that they do have pretty much cover all of the basic pizza topping flavor criteria necessary for a successful slice of pizza.   I was stuck between the Margherita pizza (Mozzarella and tomatoes) and the traditional pepperoni pizza. So what does any person in this situation so??? I GOT BOTH!   The slices here are HUGE! And I am both proud and ashamed to say that I killed both of them without hesitation. The pizza here is so deliciously authentic, fresh, and perfectly warmed so that the cheese marinates your mouth with all of the other complimentary toppings.   The service behind the counter taking the pizza orders wasn't really that great, however the girl that took the money at the cash register was an absolute doll. You can tell that even with the array of drunks that probably had made their way beforehand, she was still in good spirits and ready to serve us!  All in all, I love this place. The pizza is top notch, and the prices (low to moderate) are pretty spot on considering the monster slices they supply you with. Definitely give this a shot if you are down for some good pizza.",

The female staff is also decked out in classic pin up attire which is another added bonus. As if that wasn't enough, the slices are probably the largest single slices of pizza that I've ever had! Even though the price point which is in the $5-6 range is the same as most other pizza by the slice places on the strip, for me, the best quantity value goes to Pin-Up! The actual flavor of the pizza is very good as well. It's crust just happens to be more on the average to above average side and that's why they get only 4 stars. For me, the best crust and best overall pizza goodness goes to Secret Pizza but that's not nearly as convenient and their slices are about 20% smaller. I'd definitely come back to Pin-Up pizza if for no other reason than just to see the cute girls working there and have a good ole' slice right in the heart of the strip. Not a bad deal!",

Seating: I did not find any actual seating area at Pin Up Pizza.. Only found a standing area where you can put your plate down. There may be an actual seating area that I missed.. But standing up and eating a giant slice of pizza is not my thing.  Overall: Check this place out if you're looking for a giant slice of pizza and pay only 5-6$.",

    "text": "Items Selected:  Margherita Slice Garlic Knot  ...with my opinions on traditional New York \"slice shops\" varying from terrible to merely decent but having found some improvement in the style since relocating to Las Vegas, largely as a result of superior ingredient quality at both \"Secret Pizza\" and Pop-Up, it was with cautious optimism that I approached the newly minted Strip-side Pin Up Pizza at pH's Miracle Mile Shops for a late afternoon bite.  Truly a \"slice shop\" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of \"foldability\"...or perhaps \"fold-necessity\" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow.",

    "text": "Great food is important to me, but customer service is the most important overall. This place scores 5 stars in both categories.   I stay at the Ellara at least once a year, and I was thrilled to see a pizza place so close to us. I was inside the Sports book in Planet Hollywood and saw a sign that said \"Pizza by the slice\", so I ventured over to check it out. The pizza was very good and the slices are huge. Ask them to cut them in half for you and they will happily oblige. I put the pizza taste up there with Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan, but that is not the main reason you should come here. You must come here for the world's BEST garlic knots. Seriously, you will be so happy that you have finally found the perfect buttery, oh so garlicky piece of heavenly goodness. They heat them up right before your eyes and there is no microwave in sight. They use real ovens and absolutely know how to make great food.   Everyone who works here is super nice and the chefs were very proud of their food. They stay open until 2:00 am every night and 4:00 am on weekends. You can access the restaurant from outside the PH, or through the Sports Book and it is going to enrich your life when you try it out.",

We were just there at the end of March and the two girls working were so rude and dismissive to me and others in line that I made it a point not to return for the remainder of our stay and went to Secret Pizza instead.

Here's the rundown: No the customer service was not good, in fact, it was pretty bad. They were rushing everyone and they seemed grumpy. That being said, it was Late and super busy so I'm sure they just wanted to get the Line moving. Pie is 15 inches Long @ $7 a pop. The menu offered during the day seems a Lot more vast than what was being offered at night but that didn't bother me. & ALthough this isn't the best pizza I've had, the aroma is neckbreaking good. We were stopped by muLtipLe peopLe about where we bought this from and how they HAD to try it!!!   FYI: if you want an order of wings, you have to order it at the Ringer (bar).",

I've been telling my friends about trying the Chicken and Spinach pizza. When I got in line I requested for the Chicken and Spinach toppings and the brunette girl said \"we don't have it yet\" so I said I'll wait, she said it'll take awhile. I then opted for a mushroom one. She put it in the oven and the pizza man opened the oven with the chicken and Spinach. So I said, can I exchange it because the one I want is right there. We didn't even pay yet and it was already on display. Eva the cashier was so rude and said, you have to pay for both. My father works at Aria and they never treat customers this way. Even the customer in front of us recommended that we Yelp the incident for management to review their employees attitudes. The 2 people behind me got the chicken and spinach and I was left with the mushroom. Horrible service. Please check on your employees attitudes. They can be replaced. Before all of this happened and before I ordered, I was going to come back again to try other flavors. Remember I came to this place to try the Spanish & Chicken pizza and I did not even get that. Now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think I am going to come back here again.  For those who are reading this and is planning about going here, it is not worth the wait nor your time. The small brunette girl burnt my garlic bread (look at the photo I posted) and didn't bother to replace it. I didn't see that she burned it because she packed it in a box so fast. None of the employees and I mean none of them said one simple word, \"Sorry.\" Again, I was so excited to go to Pin-Up Pizza, but Eva and the small brunette girl ruined my whole experience.",

There's very long lines at peak hours. and the one server at the time was also taking payments. She seemed tired.  The food tasted good altogether and the price is right. For the novelty of a giant pizza, you're doing good going here.",

The ENTIRE trip, I kept trying to end up here, and it finally happened literally right before I was headed to the airport for my flight home. And, I'm SO glad I made it happen.  The pizza is AMAZING. Thin crust, HUGE slices - not AS crispy as I enjoy my NY style to be, but definitely close enough. Employees are really funny, friendly, and talkative. While you wait, you can watch the guy tossing the crazy huge pizza dough. I just tried the plain cheese and it was great. There's standing area by the window and they have more standing area outside which is nice since mostly every day/night is beautiful in vegas. You can make it a meal by getting a garlic knot and drink- I didn't end up doing that because I wasn't that hungry when I went.  Now that I know exactly where it is (outside Planet Hollywood), I can't wait to end up here again after a night out in Vegas!",

Its a cute little spot - not much room to eat in or outside but I do believe theres an actual restaurant of some sort inside? With a bigger menu or so?  Anywho - I forgot what my combo was called but it was a slice of pizza, a garlic knot & a drink for about $7. Not bad.  The pizza was pretty good. ITS SO BIG.

Their menu is very simple making to easy to chose and reducing the waiting time. They also serve to largest slice of pizza I have seen, with a nice crust and enough to fill you up (but it should not stop you from getting seconds). The name is not for nothing either, with most of the girls are actually in pin-up outfit and make-up. So busy the pizzas are continuously made just a few feet from your nose! Only thing is the lack of seating, except for a tiny stand up only area right outside the place, but at least with a nice view of the busy crowd....",

It was nice to see all the pics of entertainers and their various pin up pics throughout the space. There were only a handful of choices (I believe 6). I had a slice of pepperoni which was $7...not sure if it was worth that much but it was good. I gave it a 4 because service is really important, and if tho the 2 workers who handled the food were expedient and friendly, the young lady at the register was kind of short (of course it could've been a bad day). They had combos but for some reason when someone in front of me ordered one, the employee at the register said it wasn't available during the week. If that's the case, there should be a sign. Also when I asked about red pepper and parmesan, she said, whatever is outside is all we had... I understand there were a lot of people, however it just wasn't the most polite way to assist a patron.",

It was the girl with the glasses and tattoos, she was extremely rude to customers. I get it if a customer is giving them attitude and they respond but this girl was cussing and had NO customer service skills. When it was our turn,after waiting patiently in a hostile environment (she was arguing with a few customers before us) she pointed and said for you?

From Secret Pizza (Cosmopolitian) to Five50 Pizza Bar (Aria) to Sbarros (everywhere lol), you have your choice of pizza selections all over.  But I would be hard pressed to find a better pizza combo deal than the one that exists at Pin Up Pizza, located in front of Planet Hollywood. For $9.50, you can have any slice + garlic knot + fountain soda. Just say to the cashier, \"THE SANDRA D COMBO PLEASE\".   I choose the meatball pepperoni slice as part of my combo. Even though it is not authentic New York pizza, it is still pretty darn satisfying considering it's price. The slice is HUGE too. The real winner of the pizza combo is the garlic knot though. It's the best garlic knot I have ever had; even better than the ones from New York.  If you are trying not to break the bank in finding a inexpensive lunch on the Las Vegas Strip and you don't want to eat panda express or McDonalds, definitely try Pin Up Pizza. You will need that oily pizza grease to soak up your alcohol intake at the end of night ;)",

Kind of hard to bring a few slices back to your room without making a mess.

She said they have a limit on boxes so don't eat in casinos or whatever im like wtf how you know what the hell ima do next after trying this pizza... she don't know if i was hitting the road back home or something.

Most folks just stand outside and eat their pizza  which is cool because its normally pretty busy and you can people watch or just walk around the many places on the strip. This is perfect for lunch or if you need something soak up your alcohol. I normally eat here for that lol.",

They also have combo prices too or single slices. The garlic knot is an absolute must to try especially if you like garlic.

I walked in the exit door and started to cut the whole line, when the staff very kindly guide me to where the line began .  Standing in line you can see the menu very clearly as well as some gigantic pizzas. I ordered the Sandra D. Combo which was a slice, a knot, and a drink for  $10.25. They have seven different pizza options So I decided on the big meat slice and oh my it was so delicious! It has pepperoni, sausage and meatballs and I seriously recommend it. The flavor of the meatball and sausage is now my favorite on pizza. Did I mention these pizza slices are huge! Like bigger than my hand huge!  With that being said I can't wait to come back. If your in Las Vegas this is a spot worth trying for sure and hey it's open till 4 am",

The music is stupid loud. The counter girl couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear her. It was alot of \"huh?\" back and forth. The stand up seating is fine, but having it in the non tinted window towards the blaring sun was annoying. The cost was silly. I ordered the pizza knowing it would be a minimum of  $14. I added 2 drinks and next thing I know, I am asked for $23. It's worth a stop for the Vegas experience.",

That time approached so I made a point to come visit.  Located right on the strip right by the Miracle Mile shops and beside Pink's.  I would advise not coming on a hot day (which is only a few months out of the year in Vegas) as they refused to let us stand inside when the line formed.  Yes, we were told by an employee to go outside and we could not be inside.  I understand the line was crazy but to throw people out of the place rubbed me the wrong way.  But alas, I had made this far  and long in the line I was getting my giant pizza slice.  There were only a few varieties on pizza.  The slices were huge!  Definitely other pizza spots in Vegas to visit but it is a fun concept.",

    "text": "A bit of a hidden gem nestled by Planet Hollywood, we've been to Vegas many times and I never knew about this place. We saw Pin-Up featured on a BuzzFeed video and the size of the slices intrigued us.  The combo pizza/knot/soda for ~$10 is a great deal. You can get any kind of available slice and the whole meal is very filling. Inside is limited standing room only space and there are additional standing tables outside. The pizza itself was good for West Coast although I wish there was a way to get a fresh slice instead of the reheat method. The garlic knot was just okay, not dense like a NY style knot but more like a thin dinner roll covered in seasoning. The staff was super friendly and everything was served up very quick. I'd definitely come back here for a quick bite.",

I scoured Yelp, as usual, and came across a host of restaurants in our hotel. You know that saying, \"pictures are worth a thousand words?\" Well that quote isn't entirely True because a few choice words could have easily summarized the taste of this pizza. Salty and rubbery.   I blame the photos because we were suckered into getting a large slice of this gigantic pizza thinking it would be good. Coming from NY state we have a lot of great pizza and Pin up pizza couldn't hold a candle stick the the real stuff. Although this pizza is massive, it tastes super salty and gross. These days carbs are far and few between, so when we get a chance to indulge, it better be well worth the treat. There are way too many better places to dine on the strip to settle for this.",

But then there are slice houses that really get the job done by being open super late at night like Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan, Pizzeria Da Enzo at The Venetian, and Le Pizza at Paris LV.  Pin Up Pizza at Planet Hollywood fits perfectly into that category.  Unfortunately their late night slice selection is very limited compared to what they have during the daytime.  When I got there for a at around midnight, I went with their All-Meat slice, and one Cheese slice.  Yeah, there's no denying it.  These slices are huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1v6XLrC&s=fd04c093d152a4c6605442047ad6ffd8487c451995cae5a32098809804a764ba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1v6XLrC</a>  They're around $5-7 a slice, but the enormous size of these slices definitely justify the price and they're pretty good.  Very similar to Secret Pizza's slices in quality.  If you want a whole pie, there's unfortunately no discount.  You just take the price of the pizza slice and multiply it by ten.  So we're basically talking $70 pies!  It's worth it though if you have a big group to feed.  Overall, it's a pretty solid pizza spot on the Strip with enormous slices that are good enough to satisfy your hunger for lunch, dinner, or a late night snack.",

So glad I went there! The slice could have fed two. Got the margarita pizza with fresh mozzarella cheese, onions and the freshest of fresh cherry tomatoes.  Loved the staff as well! They were so friendly even though it seemed a tad busy. For a restaurant on the strip they have wonderful prices, fast service and seating with a view! It was standing table only, no chairs- but who cares with a angry orchard beer in your hand anyway!  My only complaint is the chili shakers. They need to buy shakers that can handle the size of the chili flakes. The holes could barely fit a handle of flakes coming out at a time.",

Maybe the workers should be more friendly and happier instead of giving people ugly looks.",

I wanted to give it a try since there was no line, and it was a quick easy bite to have before going out for a long night on the strip.  Ordered the pepperoni slice which was served warm and definitely one thing this place has down is the size of the pizza.  Pizza slices served are enormous here and the pepperoni has an awesome spice to it.  But the rest of the pizza itself... the thin crust, the cheese is nothing out of this world... overall I'd say it's average pizza.  There may be better pizza shops around in the area, but if you're looking for a quick bite this place is right smack middle in the strip and you can't miss it! I might of enjoyed it more after a long late night of drinks and partying... can definitely see this place being the perfect spot to sober up late nights!",

On their door it clearly says they close at 4AM and at 3:30AM their doors were closed for service. I looked at an employee and held up my 4 fingers to signal they close at 4AM and they signaled they were closed. This is disappointing to say the least and I as an employee of a fast food restaurant this is appalling. The fact that a company would claim they're closed 30 minutes prior to their business hours on the door is False advertisement  and I will never give this company business.",

Look at the pictures, these single slices are more like 2 slices from a normal pie. The staff was friendly and the pie was heated up and deliver to me in a minute or so. They have some stand up seating inside and some outdoor seating on the strip. When it is a 100+ you probably would just rather take it inside PH and find a seat somewhere to eat it. Maybe outside Earl of Sandwhich.   Slice prices are reasonable and not as crazy like the pinks hot dogs next door. It will really fill you up, I shared and both of us were full from a single slice. I give this place 5 stars based on convenience, price, portion size and service. Is it the best pizza ever? Probably not but it is better than most and all the other reasons make it a nice spot to hit up if you are hungry.",

That was back when Secret Pizza hit the scene in Vegas and became the only spot on the strip for reasonably good pizza. Along came Pin Up. The first two times I ate here I thought it was more authentic and certainly a better bang for your buck with their gigantic slices. Then a year or so later I stopped by and only got through maybe 1/3 of a slice. It was so salty I could not continue eating. I wrote a review about this experience.  Upon seeing that review the manager reached out and requested that I return for another try and that it was something in the sauce recipe that created the saltiness. Explanation but no suggested remedy.   About a year later I returned on business and went in for another shot at what used to be a great slice of pizza and of course the corrected sauce recipe. It was not correct. In fact it was saltier than ever. Let me point out that I have no aversion to salt; none whatsoever. Unfortunately some things are extreme, others are simply a mistake. The salt content of these slices is a mistake.     Pizza is awesome when you're drink and it's late. But sorry, this pizza is inedible due to the mega-salt content, regardless of how crick you may be. Skip this place. Or bring a gAllon of water with you.",

AND, when I say a generously portioned slice, I really mean the biggest I've ever seen.  Great New York style that blows away the slice I had earlier in the day across the street at New York, New York.  Apparently, the dough and pomodorini pelati tomatoes are flown in from Naples, Italy.  The sausage was a real treat as well; classic big gourmet style Italian.  Sounds pricey at $6.50, but it is about 50% larger than your average slice, so you shouldn't be surprised the price is fair in proportion to the size.   When you are walking The Strip/Miracle Mile at 3:30 in the morning with one of these in tote, you'll feel like a Vegas stripper walking around topless with the amount of blatant stare downs from every drunkard you pass.  Had to give directions to a couple different groups that decided whatever they were currently headed to was going to be put on hold while they b-lined it to Pin-Up.",

    "text": "really large pizza slices for $7. we got their pig pizza which included pepperoni and ham over cheese. one bite and i wasn't a fan - the pizza reminds me of a less greasy pizza hut. the crust is regular size ( not thin crust ), really chewy and doughy. i couldn't get over the fact that they didn't dress the pizza with pizza / tomato sauce -- so eating it felt like i was stuffing my face with bland carbs. bleh, no bueno.",

    "text": "HUGE slices!  They have combo specials with a garlic knot and a drink but the single slice was more than enough to fill me up.  I was happy to see a spinach and artichoke pizza, because that's my favorite and not something every pizza joint keeps on hand by the slice.  Check in on yelp and get a free beer!  Best check in offer I've come across yet! :)",

    "text": "6 bucks for a slice of pizza, you cant beat that for the size of it. We stopped here for a little or may i say a big bite on our second day on the strip. My girlfriend was shopping at Planet Hollywood, and she ordered a a cheese pizza with chicken and a garlic knot to go, and i believe i ordered a italian pizza and pepperoni. She couldnt finish hers, it was weigh to big for her stomach, so we took it to our hotel room. Pizza is great, staff are a bit non attentive in making the pizza and placing orders, not the best service. Downside to this place is theyre arent any places to sit down and relax, so we took the pizza to our hotel room. Ill stop by again on my next trip to vegas.",

    "text": "This ain't Sbarro's.  I walked through the Sportsbook into the pizza restaurant and was initially surprised that I couldn't get a whole pizza.  Pizza here is strictly by the slice.  However, the slice is enough for two people to be happy with and two slices are about the quantity of a regular pizza.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke pizza.  The artichoke was fresh and had a nice lemony tang to it.  The spinach was ample and the two veggies complemented each other nicely.  The cheese was the right proportion to the toppings and the crust was crispy.  I am so tired of Las Vegas pizzas with the soggy crust.  So, the pizza gets reheated in the oven and is served piping hot with a crispy crust and melted cheese, right?  I needed a fork and a knife to eat this bad boy, but oh was it good.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Quick and easy. Best thing this place has going for it is the location. Pizza was good, slice was huge, price was OK, and the service was friendly. There are at least four other places to grab a slice in or attached to Planet Hollywood. I haven't tried them all, but this is the best of the ones I have. I liked the Secret Pizza place across the street at the Cosmopolitan a little better, but if I was standing in front of this place, it wouldn't be worth the short walk over the bridge to get to it.",
