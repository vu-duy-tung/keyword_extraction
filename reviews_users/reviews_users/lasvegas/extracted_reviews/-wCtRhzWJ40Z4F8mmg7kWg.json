    "text": "wow is all I can say , the manager should be fired. I first want to say I have never left a bad review for any Restaurant. My Husband is a Bar and restaurant  owner and we understand the business. We spent several weeks scoping out where to eat New Years Eve, bc Vegas has so many options. Made reservations a month in advance after seeing the Menu and calling. When we saw sea bass on the menu we picked here. Reservations were at 745. Upon arrival out table was not ready , no big deal finally got sat at 8:20. Tried to sit us outside with temps around 35 degrees, so we asked to move in and all they had was a low couch and coffee table, still no big deal it was right behind the Dj and in my opinion music was not to loud, as others wrote in reviews. This was a 5 course meal, for 150.00 per person. First 3 courses came out fast 10 minutes maybe in between, everyone around us was being served their entrees , so 45 minutes later we finally asked where our main entree was, she checked and said any minute. About 5 minutes later they brought our main dish. One was snapper and one was tuna. Had to call the server back over and we said this is not Sea Bass, a different server came over and said yeah we are out so we just made this. WAIT! WHAT!, by the way its now 9:45 and we have not eaten yet and they close at 10pm. I have never seen a restaurant run out of something and not tell you and just bring what they feel like. I hate TUNA and Snapper. We ordered all our food at 8:30 pm, why is it that at 9:45 we have to ask where our food is and now they don't have any. We asked for a manger and the waitress said he will be right over. We waited half hour he never showed to our table. We than left , never had our Dinner . Horrible for the manager not to come over at all, he was'nt busy they were getting ready to close and its NEW YEARS EVE,there might have been 3 to 4 tables left.  Im guessing he wanted to get out of there and not handle our problem. I am upset that we heard so many great things and the manger did not address our problem, and our New years eve dinner was ruined. SO many good choices in Vegas , and a poor manager can ruin a business.",

My boyfriend had the filet mignon and he was pleasantly surprised! For a seafood place this was one of the best steaks he ever had! It beat Jean George steak house, half the price and twice as good! The service was excellent and wine selection was great. I'm glad we went here for my bday dinner! The ambiance was relaxing and chic. The server made me feel exclusive! I wish I remembered his name!  We are both just obsessed with this place! Made our vacation amazing! Thank you!",

The ribye we ordered was supposed to be medium rare but came medium, so we let them know and they made us a new one a well as a complimentary appetizer while we waited. The service was great and everyone was very nice. The ambiance was also nice and the look of the place was very unique. My overall experience was great.  Kristen was a great server,  very friendly,  and made the dinner run smoothly. I'll be back in the future for sure.   As for Apps, the tuna poke was excellent and the meatballs were delicious.",

The menu is primarily seafood- 4 of us shared the lobster Mac and cheese as well as ahi- all so amazing! Definitely would go back for those alone. For dinner we all ordered various fish dishes- my mahi mahi was delicious and so perfectly crispy. I throughly enjoyed every bite and the overall atmosphere of this place. Def not cheap but worth it for a fancy night out on the town.",

Started with this Chili cucumber tequila drink that was so good and refreshing that I had to have 3. Ordered the Baja Shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which was one of the best I've ever had ...so good that it sparked memories of my childhood to my moms hometown in Guadalajara Mexico where a man sold cocteles out of a cart over 25 years ago, that's how powerful the cocktail was. Our entrees where the Whole Branzino for my girlfriend which was spot on tender and juicy. I had the scallops over butternut squash risotto that where excellent. Everything I tasted was perfectly balanced and fresh, they truly have a good thing going here with a laid back relaxed atmosphere ...I mean anytime you can spark a 25 year old memory out of nowhere means you're doing something right so big props to this place. I will definitely be back ...in fact I already have my reservation set for this month. Can't wait",

The herringbone sundae was the PERFECT ending. Okay wine list but the food made up for it. I would not recommend for dinner with colleagues as the setting is very intimate.

The lady in front said she would check if there was anything available and came back, didn't mention anything and had someone else seat us inside.  Our waitress took about 20 minutes to bring us our menu and we had to flag her down to order our drinks and food. Our food came out after over an hour of waiting and they only brought it out when one of the waiters heard us complaining about how the other tables came way later than us but received their food first.   The waitress waited until the end to even check up on us. She has terrible customer service but the bald waiter was AMAZING!! He was probably the only one I seen running around and getting things done. If all the tips went to him we would've well over gave him 20% or more but since it partially went to her and everyone else there, we gave a horrible tip for the horrible service the whole restaurant provided. I've never in my life experienced such horrible service. Not to mention, we're very polite.",

This place has the perfect menu. Enough specialty cocktails that there's something you would like, but not too many where you feel overwhelmed. The food portion is also perfectly balanced. With a mix of raw, cold, hot, land, and sea, you're bound to find something that suits you. All the entrees are a la carte, so be prepared to spend a little more if you want some of that lobster Mac & Cheese.   We tried the 8 oz filet, the sea scallops -land risotto, burrata, fries, mushrooms, and lobster Mac & cheese. While everything was delicious I wasn't super impressed with the risotto that went with the sea scallops. The flavor was a little too sweet and didn't balance out the natural sweetness of the scallops. However it was all cooked to perfection. I think the real stars were the sides and the appetizers.   We sat on the patio and it was beautiful. Wonderful decor, mature potted plants everywhere, a view of one of the Aria pools. It was like being on vacation. If you are already on vacation, check this place out, if you are a local and WISH you were on an island somewhere, you'll almost feel like you aren't smack in the middle of the desert for a few hours.",

We were seated inside at one of the lounge areas which included a couch, table, and two chairs. It was a unique way to do the seating for brunch, but I enjoyed it.  We started with one of the featured cocktails and Maple Bourbon Bacon. The cocktail was much larger than the typical cocktail and was plenty for my husband and I to share since we aren't big drinkers. The Maple Bourbon Bacon was awesome. The bacon was tasty and crispy. We loved the bruleed banana and banana mousse on the side. It was interesting dish that they pulled off well.  My main included Brulee Grapefruit and Crab Cake Benny. The grapefruit was unique and tasty. I liked the sugary layer on the grapefruit which made the fruit taste a bit decadent. The Crab Cake Benny was delicious with a nice amount of crab and nicely prepared poached eggs.  My husband had the Bacon & Egg Ravioli. He thought it was okay, but nothing special. It was also only two pieces of ravioli which wasn't enough food for the cost of the dish. The pancetta was hard to find in the dish since they used so little. I wouldn't recommend this dish.  Overall, a nice spot to lounge and enjoy the weekend. I'd recommend this spot if you have time to hang out a bit since the dining style lends itself to staying awhile.",

    "text": "I could sit on the patio at Herringbone and eat oysters all day.  :)  I don't know why it took us so long to give Herringbone a try, but now that we have, we will definitely go back!  Make reservations if you plan to go for dinner, and be sure to request a table on the patio if it's not 937 degrees outside.  There is a large bar to grab a drink at if you have to wait, and service there was quick and friendly.  We noticed several people having dinner at the bar, so if the wait is super long for a table, I would definitely consider doing that, too.  The hostess was friendly and found our reservation quickly, so we were showed to our table on the patio right after we walked in.  The ambiance on the patio is so nice and unlike the other restaurants located in the Aria, we definitely want to go back and try brunch there.  The manager came over and took our drink order because our server was in the weeds, but after that initial greet, our server did an excellent job of taking care of us.  We were dining late, so we decided to share a few small plates, and with the layout of the menu, dining that way was perfect (I would recommend two appetizers/small plates per person if sharing).  Of everything we had we LOVED the oysters!!!  The variety was unique, the quality was outstanding (bright & briny!), and the kimchee mignonette was different, but refreshing and delicious.  If you love oysters, this is one of the best places we have tried in Vegas to get them.  The other standout dish we had was the Baja Shrimp Cocktail, which was so much more than just your average shrimp cocktail.  It was full of huge pieces of plump shrimp and creamy avocado - and of course came with a Coronita to really make the flavors pop!  A side of boardwalk fries paired well with both dishes, but I guess what doesn't taste good with french fries? :)  My only issue with this restaurant was the wait time for the check and our receipt to sign at the end of the meal ( more than 25 minutes total).  Other than that, it was fabulous and we cannot wait to go back! Cheers!",

We came here because it was the only restuarant with availability before 10pm on a Saturday night.  To start, we ordered the Rockefeller oysters.  They arrived tiny bite size,  cold, and disgusting. Main entree, my husband ordered the surf and turf. That arrived with HALF a tail and 1 claw. The filet was ordered to be cooked medium rare but arrived over cooked, looked and tasted old and sad. He sent it back after the first bite. My Chilean sea bass looked and tasted like it came out of a box from the freezer; the flavor was minerally and the texture was gelatinous. Needless to say, I will never come back or recommend this restaurant.  I am truly  shocked by all the positive reviews.",

    "text": "Came here for the Sunday Brunch that cost $60 per person.  First off, the thing that I like about this place is that there was virtually no line.  It's on the small side and at other times is a regular restaurant.  I do like that there's an ala carte menu that you can order food from also.  This is also included with your $60.   Now, when you go to a buffet and pay this amount of money, you would think that the food would be up to par right??  Well, not this time.  The food was just ok.  It looked prettier than how it tasted.  Let me start with the ala carte menu.  We ordered the kobe sliders, oysters, loco moco, chilaquiles, duck fat fries and an egg in a tomato sauce.  I did like the sliders, the beef patty was not overcooked and still was juicy.  It was a bit gamey, but not overly gamey.  So if you don't like this taste in your burger, you might want to stay away from it.  The duck fat fries was probably the best.  It was crispy and had hints of truffle.  The loco moco was definitely not what I've had in Hawaiian.   I picked up some pork loin and steak from the carving station.  They didn't have any prime rib, so I was a little disappointed.  The pork loin was dry and it looked like it when I was plating it.  It's obvious with it sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long.  The steak wasn't that great either.  It was well done and was a bit dry.  I should have put some gravy or some kind of sauce to put some moisture back into it.   The seafood area had poke, peeled shrimp, lobster tail and crab legs.  The shrimp was just ok.  Nothing special about shrimp sitting on a bed of ice.  The crab legs had a hint of sweetness to it, but again, nothing special.  The lobster tail was the biggest disappointment IMO.  The tail was not only small, but they cut it in half also.  It made it very difficult to extract any meat out of the tail without turning it into mush.  I wished they would have served the entire tail.  I can understand them splitting the tail if it was a 1 pounder, but tail was so small, it reminded me of a tail off of a langoustine.  Now, if they really wanted to impress their customers, they would have served the entire tall.  Makes for a better presentation.  One more thing, if you want butter with your crustaceans, you have to ask your server for it.  They don't have it available at the seafood station.  By the time our server brought out the butter, I had already finished my seafood.  They actually melt the butter per request.  That kind of kills the dining experience.   The dessert bar was just ok.  Nothing great about it.  I've had better desserts at cheap buffets than what they served here.   Overall, I was very disappointed with the amount they charge.  I would have been better off going to Bacchanal for the same amount.  The food there is way superior and a lot more options than Herringbone.  Definitely leaving this place off my list for dining options.  Normally I would have rated this place 3 stars, but for the type of restaurant it is the exorbitant price point, I have to lower it to 2 stars.  Management really needs to improve food taste to justify the $60.",

Oysters = super fresh! Octopus = 10/10 delicious, where's the other 7 legs? Tuna poke = 8/10 good but forgetful  Grilled Whole branzino = 9/10 great flavor and light and fluffy! Fileted, so didn't have to deal with bones! Not fishy at all!  Salmon = 8/10 well cooked and meaty. Skin side was nice and crisp. Tasty especially with the succotash it was served with.  Seared Tuna = 7/10 good but not as good as the other 2 dishes. Saving grace was the sauce it was served with to add more flavor.  Mashed potatoes = 6/10 too rich and buttery for me. You can see the oil/butter on top.   Brussels = 8/10 delicious.  Order this side! Doesn't taste Healthy which means it's good!  Cocktails = 9/10 all were good, no complaints, well made concoctions!",

Even though Herringbone specializes in seafood, the filet mignon is one of the better ones I've had even from steakhouses. They also offer a lot of seafood options. I believe we got the fish steak as an appetizer, and it came out grilled and with very little bones; a healthy option. We came for dinner, so expect to take 2 hours.

The crab legs and lobster tail were a bit disappointing, i was definitely expecting something better for the price you pay for brunch. The entrees from the menu were great. I also enjoyed the oysters from the menu and don't recommend the oysters from the cold bar.

Those were delicious and were offered up complimentary. Nice touch. I had the Mussels and Clams entree. The portion was generous and the food was delicious. Combine the garlic sauce based Mussels and Clams with beer and it was instant heaven.

The Seafood spaghetti was really good too, the seafood they put in was good selection (including squid, crab meat, 2 or 3 huge prawns, a few huge scallops as well). The sauce was Amazing.

I went with the meatballs, as it was highly reviewed, and the little gem salad at the recommendation of my waiter. He compared it to their take on a Caesar salad. I was annoyed at the size of the cuts on the lettuce- it took a good bit of chopping on my part; dressing and components were good but nothing earth shattering. The meatballs were moist, and the bread it's served with is slightly charred but soft and great! There are 4 meatballs served with ricotta cheese. The salad was a large portion; you could get away with just that as your entree. If I go back, I'll definitely try something different. The craft cocktails looked amazing. Would be a great spot to have cocktails on the patio.   Came back to try Herringbone again and had a much better experience inside at the bar. The sea bass with purple cauliflower and fingerling potatoes is absolutely killer! Perfect portion, large piece of fish and great puree to accompany the sides. Will definitely be back for the sea bass again!",

    "text": "So, we're checking out the menu online and everything looks great. Looking forward to trying something new on our vacations. Wednesday night, we easily book for two at 9pm. Showing up a bit early we notice that it's that new-fangled \"couch seating\". I believe it's called \"lounge\" and of course it's all the rage these days. Ugh. Not a fan. If I want to eat dinner from a coffee table sitting on a couch... well... I'll just stay home. It's \"fancy\" food with Vegas casino prices, I'm not interested in holding a large heavy plate of clams and mussels in my lap. Why not pull up a TV and put on \"Grimm\", sounds like a perfect evening out, right?  We elect to sit at the bar, which also isn't our favorite, but much better than leaning over the low coffee tables. As we're coming in, we notice several couples, dressed nicely with napkins across their knees, taking very careful spoonfuls of food from the low tables. You know how you have to hold your hand under the fork so you don't spill pureed carrot sauce on your strapless Versace? Yeah, we saw that.  It's important to note that the place is totally swank and had a groovy vibe, the couches and chairs looked really comfy. I totally get the concept, but not for \"full\" fare. If it was all small bites, tapas and drinks, then it would be fine.   On to the food. We've been to Julian Serrano several times (also at Aria) and come to expect amazing presentation and flavor combinations that we don't get normally. Eating anywhere at an upscale Vegas casino should be the pinnacle of gourmet. The food at Herringbone was well prepared and tasted very good, but for the money, we didn't find that it had the \"wow\" that we experience consistently at Julian Serrano.  We started with Roasted Beets (excellent), but unfortunately I make my own version that we like better (always looking for new ideas). I had the Ora King Salmon, a large cut which was cooked perfectly and seared crispy. Along with carrot puree, more beets and lime salsa, it paired well with the salmon. My wife enjoyed the Mussels & Clams, but again, it didn't have the \"wow\". We also ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese which contained a decent amount of lobster, but I seem to remember that the sauce was a bit split. Had to try the Death by Potatoes as well and found it to be very tasty (pancetta FTW), but also a little too buttery... based on the description though, I should have expected it, so I can't fault it.  Service was perfect, the bartenders took care of us well. Presentation was very nice.  I think we'd come back in a heartbeat for tapas (sized+priced) and drinks, it's a nice place. Or perhaps dinner without the extra sides outside on the patio (tall-boy tables) if the weather was nice (it was closed because of a storm the night we visited).  FOOD: 4 stars AMBIANCE: 4 stars VALUE: 3 stars SEATING: 2 stars (personal preference)",

Like standard wood chairs that are too tall for the tables.  My back literally hurts from sitting there on that cheap chair.  Pretty unfortunate that the place that devoted so much time to detail incredible copper silverware didn't look at how awful their chairs and seating are.    Probably other places I would check out at city center first",

However, we decided to try their all you can eat brunch menu and we were not disappointed.  I love the fact that they had 10 cook to order dishes. We ordered the loco moco, wings, fish tacos and fries.  The loco moco was wonderful.  The truffle sauce took the flavor into another level for such a casual dish.  The wings was also really good with thai flavors.  The Fish tacos was fresh and did not disappoint.  As far as the buffet, everything tasted wonderful. They had salad bar and their quinoa salad was yummy! I loved the seafood section with poke, broiled shrimps, oysters, and crabs. The stone crab was not fresh though.  Maybe it was a bad batch. We sat at the patio with an awesome DJ. It was the perfect brunch.  Customer service was wonderful. Oh ya and desserts was also great. If you see the small mini pink donuts, GET IT!!",

I had the White Sea Bass, because it had been raved about by a few yelpers, but I found it dull, uninventive and oversalted. One of my food friends had the cioppino which may have been the best dish of the night, but still rather lacklustre, even though the waiter recommended it heartily. My other food friend had Branzino which we all tried and all agreed was the least interesting dish. My fourth food friend had the seafood spaghetti but I couldn't taste the seafood OR the spaghetti because there was so much salt. We finished with cookies and syrupy vanilla milk.  At the end of the meal,  I said  \"well, one thing's for sure: Milos has nothing to worry about.\"  Oh, and one other extremely irritating thing about this place is they have club music blasting in their lounge and in the restaurant which makes for a decidedly unpleasant dining environment.",

We loved the oysters, buffalo squid, scallops, FISH TACOS, and ask for the lavash! I love all the trendy decor, the DJ spinning better music than the night club and the Manager Jason had some great menu suggestions and was very attentive. I don't usually expect a Las Vegas upscale restaurant manager to bother checking on guests. I think he enjoys his job, best customer service and food! P.S. What were we thinking not going for brunch?",

I have enjoyed most of the seafood items on the menu and I cannot wait to go back to try more!  Out of everything on the menu-the Salted Carmel Panna Cotta is my top choice(I know it's a desert.. Shhh)! I would give up my unborn first born for it! (Well, not actually but it is seriously heavenly.)   Their specialty cocktails are also perfectly balance and excellent!

Fresh seafood in the middle of Vegas as a price point very slightly (very slightly) lower than the surrounding restaurants.  ~$120 for a dinner for two, without drinks.  Yellowtail crudo was excellent as was the burrata appetizer.  Had the whole grilled branzino (yes its the whole fish) and the white sea bass, both were excellent as well.  Service was efficient and friendly, and they have a fairly extensive wine list hitting a lot of different price points.  Overall an excellent experience.  So why only 4-stars?  Because this place has succumbed to the pressures of trying to be as hip as possible, so half of their tables are basically coffee tables with arm chairs positioned around them.  Who the hell wants to eat a nice meal sitting at a coffee table, trying not to spill your meal on your lap?  Make reservations, request a normal table, and hopefully you'll be pleased.",

My guys ordered the Yellowtail thinking it was the sashimi of the day of the special. Evan totally took care of them and got them the right dish.   DJ Bob was also killing the decks with sweet tunes.

We sat outside and were in the restaurant for about 2 hours - they were welcoming and did not rush us whatsoever. We loved the outside scenary and action.   For food, they have multiple chef stations inside with the highest quality food - the staff was so friendly, answering all questions and cooking everything to perfection.

Enchanting decor they have to sit outside!  Not romantic but fun it was with today's top pop hits blasting through their speakers!  Wonderful it was to start off with a dozen of perfectly shucked  \"Point Lookout Oysters\", outstanding was their \"Kimchee Mignonette\" with the tasty morsels!  Next we shared two entrees, which were split beautifully for us! Their \"Chilean Sea Bass\" was outstandingly moist and the vegetables were yummy!  And, their \"Mushroom Carbonara\" was simply fabulously spicy and rich!  CHEERS!",

We ordered: * Buffalo Octopus * Wings * Brussels & Pecans * Duck Fat Fries  Everything was above adequate, all seasoned to perfection. I had to order the non-alcoholic Patio Crusher since I got another year till the big 21! But I'd order it even when I am 21 since it was so damn good!

There is an Al Carte menu which is just for the bar. We got All you can eat brunch which was about $59. This included 4-5 different stations of foods and also you can order as much as you want on the al carte menu. At first we were just going to do the Al Carte menu but decided with the price ranges of the Al Carte menu it would probably be more beneficial if we decided to do the all you can eat. That was a great idea.   And than there are few different drink packages. We got one that was about $35 and it consisted of all you can drink mimosas, Bellini, and bloody Marys. The other drink packages had premium alcohol and/or champagne on it for higher price.  The different food stations: we had a seafood station that had oysters, crab legs, shrimp, and poke. All delicious and we visited this station the most. They had a dessert station, a fresh salad station, they had a juice station, and a station where they had bagels, steak and salmon. All really good.  From the Al Carte menu we ordered Loco Moco and Fish tacos. Both were soooo delicious. From the juice station they had this bomb juice that had berries, pomegranate, Red Bull and vodka! wow that was so good we had 3 of them. It was safe to say that we left that place in a good mood!   The staff was very attentive. Always coming to check on us, never had an empty glass.   Great brunch. Highly recommend",

While I haven't really had a bad meal in any of the higher end Strip Casinos, I have never walked away as impressed as I was with Herringbone.   Herringbone has a large bar that can accommodate large crowds and serves great cocktails, wine, and beer. The dining room is split between an outdoor patio area, which is neat because it is inside the Casino, and a smaller indoor dining room. It is a VERY cool space. One that would be right at home for either business or a nice date.  The food was simply outstanding. While I have only eaten there once and can only directly speak to the awesome Sea Bass I had, I was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their meal. I did sneak a bite of the Short Rib which I don't even really like and it was phenomenal!   If you are staying at Aria, you really have to eat at Herringbone. You have no excuse! If you are in Las Vegas proper, Herrringbone is absolutely worth making a trip for. Based on my one experience, it is 100% worth the trip!!",

One improvement I would suggest is for the hostess to offer us to wait at the bar if our entire party has not arrived yet. Or have seats in front for people to wait.  I actually stood around the hostess stand for a while and eventually just told them I was going to go sit at the bar and wait.  Place is also pretty dead for a Sunday brunch.",

My bf and I decided to enjoy the rest of our night at the bar and order some light bites and drinks.   Started off with a glass of Merlot and had the mussels braised in curry, served with pipping hot pita. The pita was burnt and was surprised it was served that way. The mussels were fresh and was cooked perfectly. The curry sauce was robust and nutty but had way too much oil in it. There were tons of oil puddles swimming with the mussels.   The yellowtail crudo definitely had potential. It was served beautifully on a platter, and the fried onions added a nice crunch to the dish. However, the yellowtail was fishy and it could have been because the night was almost over. I was hoping more hints of grapefurit for some additional flavors and would recommend that this is incorporated a bit stronger with the yellowtail.   Marco our bartender was absolutely awesome and made sure we were well taken care of! Thanks Marco for being the highlight of Herringbone LV; I still want to check out the one in Santa Monica and hope that the seafood would be on point.",

You must order the wings off the menu. The wings have a great spice kick to it and is crispy and flavorful. It is honestly the best wings I have ever had, flavor wise.   The lemon meringue pastry is a must try dessert! The cream on top pairs perfectly with the cookie on the bottom of the dessert.

This place is one of the better places that we have been to (especially considering that there is no ocean nearby). This is hands down the best seafood place we have eaten in Las Vegas.  We used Open Table to make a reservation, as we were not sure how busy it would be. It was a good thing that we did. This place filled up once we were seated (and I understand why!)   We were here for dinner.... The starters / apps all looked so good that we opted to split 2 of them and split one main dish. We started off with some of the freshest and tastiest Tuna Poke that we have ever had. The serving size was actually more than we were expecting, as well. Our main dish that we split was the sea bass. It was cooked perfectly! We didn't plan on getting dessert here, but we did. We got the chocolate sea salt and caramel (it has chocolate sauce, candied hazelnuts, chocolate crumble, and Nutella gelato).. I'm not a big fan of chocolate but my husband is. I had just a few bites, and it actually worked and wasn't a full overload of chocolate. My husband was happy to eat the rest of it by himself, once I couldn't do any more.  The staff were all very knowledgeable and super friendly. I can see why this place keeps getting such good reviews. It is hard to stand out in such a food place like Las Vegas, but I can see how and why it does. It's one spot that stands out above the others, where you can remember what you ate long after you went there!",

I got the San Francisco inspired Cioppino and the portion was enormous! I highly highly recommend this dish because it includes a generous amount of seafood: lobster, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  This dish was too big of a portion so maybe you can share this and another dish. Overall I was pretty satisfied!  The service was below average but we were in a rush anyway.

The food was fantabulous and better than up your typical buffet.  (Aka look elsewhere for your powdered eggs and too well done crispy bacon strips or your sushi/noodles stations...not a world marketplace buffet) Having tasted most buffets up and down the strip with the exception of the Bally's sterling brunch, this is one definitely worth coming back to.  The seafood was fresh with their light marinade to the fresh squeezed fruit juices, juicy and tasty Kobe beef burgers and eggs al forno.  Never came close to eating everything they had to offer (I double up on seafood anywhere) but will be back for the food and unique beats. The service could of been better with plate clearing ....attention was diverted to the \"whales\" with prompt drink/water refills, folded napkins upon return and immediate plate clearing...i guess im not one of those lol.  Cheers!",

The crunchy tostada was a great vehicle to pick up this dish and get down an dirty!!!!  The roasted beet and buratta was probably one of the best parts the prosciutto set the dish off.  Salty, fatty, earthy, amazing!  2.5 # Baja style lobster was on pointe... corn off the Cobb elote style!!! Black beans and salsas were a perfect touch to an exemplary dish.    Filet with chimchurri simple but just what the pallette needed to go with the lobster.  Portion was perfect.   We sat on the patio and enjoyed every aspect of this place.  We will definitely be back",

We dined here on a Wednesday evening, ambience is amazing on the patio, the food runners and wait staff were amazing, waitress who actually took our order was subpar unfortunately the 2 gentlemen who were assisting her were far more attentive & willing to go above and beyond. One thing I really did appreciate was the manager walking around touching tables, very rarely do you see that these days in the industry.",

Today we had the Baja shrimp cocktail, loco moco, and the chicken cobb salad. LOVED the baja shrimp cocktail which comes with a Coronita and crackers, both of us were forging for the last bite. The loco moco was delicious and good for if you're hungry because it's super filling. The chicken cobb salad was amazing! They give you two dressing options but I only used the ranch. Super tasty! It's loaded with chicken and bacon which is nice. All of the portions were huge which is great for sharing. We sat outside by the pool (when it's too hot, they have misting umbrellas) which was fantastic. Overall, this place is solid and always a good time.",

    "text": "Just wanted to give a very big shoutout to our bartender, Brandon, and the rest of the staff at Herringbone for going above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was as comfortable as possible.    My party and I showed up last Saturday morning for the most amazing brunch buffet and Brandon ensured that our drinks were flowing and that our food came out exactly to order.   The brunch buffet, which I believe is $54.99, offers amazing items like a raw bar, sliced to order prime rib and porchetta, an omelet station, a dessert station, and there fruit juices on ice that you can grab and bring back to your table or even take it to go. On top of that, you can also opt in for various levels of unlimited vodka and mimosas, which of course we all jumped in on. In my honest opinion, this brunch buffet is one of the best values for money on the Strip in terms of value, quantity, and unbelievable service.   The only hiccup that occurred during our experience was our order of 3 dozen Fannie Bay oysters getting delivered to the wrong table. We suspected they got delivered to a larger table where a bachelorette party was seated. In any case, Brandon suspected something was wrong and he immediately went to his manager to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, they weren't able to shuck another 3 dozen oysters so we were \"encouraged\" to go directly to the raw bar and request them. It ended up working out because we came back and ate way more than 3 dozen oysters anyway.   All in all, my wife and I plan to make Herringbone Las Vegas a frequent place for us to dine when we come back again to visit because of the awesome food and hospitality. Thank you again, Brandon and team!",

There's a lot of great food in Vegas, but when it's coupled with personal experience, it makes you want to come back for more!!! The manager Danny even came by to greet us. We will definitely come back for more lobster, oysters, prime rib, waffles, and endless drinks. Considering I'm not a fan of buffets, this was definitely a Vegas worthy spot you must hit!!!",

    "text": "Late night grub just before closing.  Everything was delish, especially the smaller appetizer-like dishes - but entrees were a miss. My friend strongly recommended the lighter fare like brunch on the patio (the menu is different) - so I would love to give this place another try on my next visit.  Ordered: Whole fish ceviche Grilled Baby Octopus Meatballs (the server couldnt stop praising about) Wings Seafood Spaghetti Mary's Roasted Chicken  ----------------------------------- Favs (if i can pick):  Whole Fish Ceviche - so delicious but be warned of the small portion - felt more like a carpaccio (the sliced raw fish pieces are presented like a whole fish hence the name) rather than a typical ceviche where everything is chopped up and mixed. All the ingredients and the sauce come together like a delicacy.  Octopus - most deliciously charred. Those r not decorations - its the perfect finishing to the plate. ------------------------------------- Miss:  Seafood Spaghetti for $45 - most expensive dish on the menu, I presume because of the lobster, crab, scallops etc etc.   I really think my dish was missing lobster - I was too dumbfounded like \"they couldnt have possibly left out an ingredient\" - so I didn't ask. To this day, I question it (u can see my picture)  But overall, no visible lobster meat (i didnt see any red) and 1 giant scallop (seriously?) = not worth $45 for a pasta. I think the chef was ready to call it a night.  p.s. The pasta noodles are mixed black and white - at $45, Im thinking its pasta made from squid ink *shrug*",

We got really good recommendations from our server. The wait for our food wasn't too long, the food arrived and we were impressed with everything! Awesome food and drinks. Thanks Herringbone for such an amazing experience!",

    "text": "My bestie is 1,432 months pregnant and refused to balance her plate on her belly at one of the couches, so we sat up at the bar (which was absolutely lovely). Here's the rundown of our decadent meal:  Small Bites ------------- WINGS These lollipops fall right off the bone have just the right balance of crispiness and juiciness. The peanut sauce was killer, and thanks to the frenching of the wings, we didn't look like sloppy 5 year-olds with sauce and chicken remnants all over our faces and hands. #classyladies  PT. JUDITH CALAMARI I had to order this to erase the memory of the disgusting airport calamari that I had eaten the night before. It did the job. My good friend (Google) let me know that Port Judith, Rhode Island is the hub of the US squid business and that Atlantic Squid is greater than Squid Imported from China. Agreed.  OCTOPUS Every time I've eaten octopus, it's kinda been like chewing on sole of a Teva sandal, but we ordered this on the recommendation of the chef. It did not disappoint. No rubberiness whatsoever. The texture was amazing and the salsa verde and preserved lemons gave it a wonderfully zingy and fresh flavor. It's the kind of dish that you go out of your way to come back for -- my favorite of the appetizers.  Chef Special --------------- The chef took the night's special and shrunk it down into bite-sized portions for us. I can't remember all the details because I was in a food-induced euphoric state, but it was a white fish (crispy skin still on - soooo good) and shrimp with risotto. Holy ****, the RISOTTO. It was made with the leftover sauce from the shrimp, along with white wine and Meyer lemons. One bite of the risotto and I wanted to bust into the kitchen and - without saying a word - make a beeline for the chef to hug it out.  Entrees --------- 8oz CENTER CUT FILET I have a visceral reaction when my steak is not the proper temperature. I get unreasonably angry internally, as I choke down charred disgustingness with a fake smile on my face. (I don't send food back. It's not in my DNA.) This filet was 8 ounces of medium rare perfection. Crusty on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. And lets talk about my side, the Death By Potatoes. (Yes, that's how it reads on the menu.) The chef described it as \"fat on fat on fat on fat\". How could you go wrong with that? YOU CAN'T. Parmesan, mascarpone, butter, pancetta, and scallions. I may have clogged an artery last night. NO REGRETS.  WHITE SEA BASS The bestie got the white sea bass. When it came out, I got a whiff of the truffle vinaigrette and almost slapped her for a bite. Thank God she offered me a taste before it got to that. It's the kind of fish that even people that say \"I hate fish\" would love.  Desserts ---------- COCONUT CARROT CAKE I fancy myself a carrot cake connoisseur and this was the best I have ever had in my life, hands down. It makes me want to murder every other carrot cake out there. Posers.  TURTLE CHEESECAKE The bartender strong-armed us into getting this. (And by strong-armed, I mean, raved about it and politely suggested we try it.) The cheesecake was silky and the Oreo crust was finely crumbled and delicious, but it was the toasted pecans that blew my mind. It was the perfect complement to my almost comically-sized giant after-dinner coffee.  If this place had a 'Most Eaten in a Single Visit' award, I would have left with the crown last night. Every bite was phenomenal and the service was exceptional. Now please excuse me while I eat my breakfast in bed (AKA leftover steak).",

This time it was the Yellow tail sashimi. I've simply never had it better. Topped with pomegranates and thin chilis it simply envelopes your mouth in flavor. I don't think I've ever tasted Yellow tail that deeply before. Our brunch service was quick and effective. The Lobster roll was heart throbbing delicious.  It's one of those things you wish you could eat until your gut hurts. The real icing on the cake was the Chef taking care of my partner who has a laundry list of allergies. They did so with a smile- even presenting a custom allergen free desert not on the menu. Thank you Herringbone! We shall return.",

    "text": "Had a very nice experience at Herringbone. Friday a little before noon, greeted by two lovely hostesses. They asked about my day, and gave me many seating options. Everyone on the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the lunch box with the little gem salad (Caesar salad w bits of cooked tuna and a soft boiled egg..nice touch!) and the two hand burger. The burger is a huge, sloppy, double patty burger. It does take two hands, and the ability to unhinge your jaw it's so tall. It also loses all structural integrity after a few bits, so the more fastidious will need to resort to fork and knife.  There was some confusion with my order, and they were very apologetic about it and brought me a complimentary shrimp cocktail and glass of champagne! Between the salad, burger, fries, and extras it was all way too much food but the gesture was much appreciated.   At $38 it's pricey but to be expected. Thanks guys!",

At $79 for their \"buffet\" and $40 for all you can drink mimosa, bloody Mary and well drinks, this place comes with a steep price tag. Now with that being said, the food is fabulous and the service is phenomenal. We had Peter serving us on a beautiful sunny morning where we sat outside on their gorgeous patio where they had a DJ spinning music. We tried everything on their special brunch all you can eat menu of 8 items. They also had a cold seafood bar and a omelet bar as well. I would say this is a special occasion or business meeting / date type of place vs an everyday brunch place.",

If you're not familiar with the Aria, then you'll learn to realize that the casino is rather massive. This restaurant is located in a hidden area next to the buffet.   Ambiance: From the outside it's not very appealing or inviting. The interior was purposely kept dark to give it a lounge and romantic setting. The table seating wasn't too comfortable. tables were placed very oddly unlike a restaurant that's sort of upscale & trendy. My boss thought the servers were all \"extremely attractive\" and he's right, but again it's Vegas so this is a good strategy to have. How to better drive business? Simple: Sex appeal.   Food:  Burrata - well garnished dish with plenty to share with 2 pple.  Branzino Ceviche - supposedly a whole fish but they don't serve you with the head or tail, just the cuts of fish. Very refreshing! New Zealand Trout - grew up eating trout from South Africa. The trout was well cooked and it's a huge piece of fish laid on roasted vegetables.   Overall: I suggest those who like seafood to give this place a try. The ingredients were quite fresh.",

    "text": "Worst New Years dinner ever. Here's the TLDR. Small party of 3, late seating, horrible service, ran out of food and lost our wine, then after the abysmal service they forced $100 gratuity on us. The food also isn't really on par with what they are charging here. I know it's the Aria but I get better food for half the price and 10x better service from my local spots.   30+minutes late seating our reservation because they couldn't find someone to clear tables. I spoke to the reception several times and pointed to empty tables. It wasn't busy, the rush passed. They kept saying 5 minutes. We finally get seated and right off the bat we find out they are out of the highlight dishes on the price fixed menu. So we ordered a bottle of wine while thinking over the few choices we did have. Well they Could not find the wine we ordered, waited half an hour for drinks. I asked the waitress several times what was going on, didnwe need to just order cocktails or something. Waitress completely uninterested in helping us. Just said they sent a runner and he would be there soon. He wasn't. I had to find the manager who found something for us quickly. During dinner they Messed up the order and brought us the wrong items. Ran out of the sides on the menu so they did an auto sub without asking. Brought me my friends steak which he ordered medium and he got my rare one but it was so dark we didn't notice until we each took a bite. The waitress was hardly ever at the table. The manager did come by to top up our wine.   The food was good but what really ruined things was the added $100 gratuity on a party of 3. The service was obviously not good. It was horrible. So we ended up paying $600 for 3 people to get ok food we didn't want and horrible service.   If I was just rating the food it would be 4 stars. However the service issues were just too great for a place charging this kind of money for a dining experience. We went to a much lesser caliber place the following day and had incredible service.",

The kind of place which made our family purchase matching T-shirts to commemorate our visit. Those expectations were met w/ disappointment in Vegas. Ordered the Buffalo Octopus, Ceviche Tostadas and short ribs. Presentation aside, none were on point and the short ribs were especially underwhelming -- it could have simmered a few hours longer for tenderness and more flavor. The ambience was nothing like the one in Honolulu, but simply, meh...The saving grace was the kind wait staff. Our waiter did a wonderful job to try to make things work, but the kitchen could up their game. After spending $100, we went to Shake Shack for burgers.",

Only brunch item that is probably a bit subpar is French toast, and that's because right across is Bardot and Michael Mina's French toast will make anyone and anything look fickle in front of it. So there you go, I'll still go to this place despite being crazy expensive and having the 2nd best French toast on the 2nd floor of Aria.",

After they finished chatting with each other, the blond one turned around slowly with her head down (I was still waiting) slowly she looked up and asked,\"how can I help you?\" (With no smile on her face whatsoever) After giving her the name on the reservation, she asked us to pick between all-you-can-eat and a la carte menus without explaining the differences, we had to ask her, then she impatiently showed us the menus.... after we picked our choice of food, the three women were all still hanging out behind the podium with no sign of walking us to the table... We walked closer to the door, they said,\"we are not walking you to the table yet.\"   With such a horrible experience I decided to walk away and went to Bardot instead (which's much better restaurant)....Those girls work at a regular seafood restaurant making minimum wages, why were they so arrogant?",

My wife and I were excited to try Herringbone for our Saturday brunch and we weren't disappointed.   The brunch club structure was a little unique but we really liked it. For a flat fee you can buy access to the buffet as well as made to order al la carte dishes and a drink package...or you can do it the regular way, all al la carte. We opted in for the buffet w/menu and drinks.  Their buffet was impressive. Lobster tails cooked perfectly and fresh oysters ready to eat. Tri-tip and BBQ'd sausage at a carving station. An assortment of pastries and salads. We really liked it. Their al la carte menu was also very impressive and we enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered.   Finally about 14 mimosas in from all you can drink and I was ready to leave. Great experience and we will return.",

I would definitely recommend you pay that line a few visits! They also have desserts that looked incredible, however, I shared a little of my daughter's birthday treat, so I didn't have room left for any more food or sweets.   The mimosas looked so good but I opted for a cocktail instead, sadly I forgot the name of it, but I'll include a picture. The server recommended it, and she apparently has great taste!

    "text": "We were looking forward to trying Herringbone for some time. Made our reservation over a month in advance. When we arrived for our 6:30 reservation, there was no problem getting a table because the place was nearly empty. The hostess sat us at what we hoped would be a quiet table in the corner. The restaurant could be described as upscale casual. Lots of televisions with sports shows on them. No table cloths, just small leather place mats. It was about 10 minutes or so before our server, David, came to the table to get our drink orders. Another 10 minutes before the water arrived. And another 10 minutes before the adult beverages got to the table. And we still hadn't given our order for dinner. It was about 45 minutes before we got to hear the specials and place our order. We decided to share 2 apps and 2 \"plates\" ( their entree sized portions). As appetizers, we tried the Buffalo Octopus ($21) and the Peel & Eat Shrimp ($22). The octopus had a nice presentation- 3 pieces of octopus, nicely arranged on a small plate with a couple of carrot slices and some black eyed peas. Tasty. The P&E Shrimp was a run of the mill shrimp cocktail served over ice with a small cup of cocktail sauce. OK but really nothing special. For my entree I got the seared tuna ($37). The plate had 4 one inch diameter cylinders of tuna with a small scoop of humus and a very small portion of an eggplant-like side on the plate. An appetizer-sized portion with an entree-sized price. Really good seared ahi should melt in your mouth. This didn't. It wasn't bad. Just meh.  My wife got the branzino ($46). Served filleted with the head on. Also meh. As side dishes we got the Boardwalk Fries and the Brussels Sprouts and Pecans. Both came to the table room temperature. I know, I know. I should have sent them back. But when you've been sitting well over an hour waiting for the food, you are not anxious for anything to go back to the kitchen. Besides, to send something back, we would have to have seen our server. After taking our order, his next appearance at our table was to hand us the check at the end of the meal. Which brings me to the service. Which was absolutely awful. When we came in, the place was pretty empty (see my photo). You would think that would make for great service. Nope. Besides for being extremely slow to get the food out of the kitchen, no one came by to see if we needed anything more after the food hit the table. Our water glasses stayed empty until we could flag down a busboy to refill them. We were pretty much ignored for the evening. Oh yeah, did I mention that they charged $3 for 3 slices of cold toast. And $9 for parking. Bottom line, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 adult drinks for $200. Suggestion: If you feel like a fish dinner, take an Uber 3 miles south on Las Vegas Blvd to Bonefish. The service is much better, the fish fresher, the prices more reasonable, and the parking is free.",

We had shrimp cocktail (which they were nice enough to let us order although not on lunch menu), oysters, Caesar salad, mango avocado salad and a lobster roll. They were all fantastic. Shrimp cocktail was seasoned with some sort of oil and cracked black pepper. We loved it but just be advised the shrimp is not plain. Service was also great. Will return.",

We ordered 2 glasses of wine, the boardwalk fries and the shrimp ceviche. The fries were fresh, hot and tasty. I loved the aioli they are served with. The shrimp ceviche was so good, I wanted to go back the next night and have it again. It's clamato, avocado, scallion and tomato salsa. It's served with saltines and a tiny bottle of corona. It just tasted so refreshing. I would order both again and hope to visit for dinner!",

If you are really set on going here for breakfast I would say do it in a weekday where you can possibly sit outside without having to pay the set price menu. Or skip altogether and try a different option.",

Herringbone is known for the fresh fish they serve. I had the French onion soup which was very delicious along with the tuna tartar and my favorite Brussel sprouts and pecans (probably one of the best ones we've ever had). My boyfriend enjoyed the drinks there he's favorite was the Japanese whiskey. For the main dish I had the Salmon and my boyfriend got the Branzino. The fish was extremely delicious and fresh. And to top it all off with dessert since my boyfriend had told them it was our anniversary they surprised us with cookie ice cream sandwiches. The environment was very nice and intimate and the music they were playing was literally sounding like all the songs from my boyfriends iPod. But definitely make reservations because they get very busy!!!!!",

One of the best brunch's we've had in a long time, what a pleasant discovery.  It's all you can eat, all brunch items on the menu are included, but the kicker are the different chef stations throughout the restaurant in addition to what's on the menu...specialty salads/charcuterie, raw seafood bar, meats & fish, &, desert. Between the menu items and the stations, we felt like we had it all covered and everything was exceptional.  Cool comfortable interior, nice outdoor patio dinning as well.",

    "text": "Came in around 3pm for lunch Yesterday after debating between Julian Serrano or Herringbone. My girlfriend and I had planned to go here for our anniversary dinner a week ago but was told the patio was closed due to an event so we ended up doing lunch at Milos that day. Still wanting to give this place a try we walked up to the host stand to get seated and was told they only have their small bites menu. Which seemed weird for a restaurant to only offer that menu at that time when they have their only lunch menu and dinner menu but I guess the kitchen might have been transitioning to dinner or something. We were hungry and in a rush so we were seated outside at the patio which was nice. What wasn't great was being put in the middle of the Vegas sun as it's hitting the 90s now with barely any shade while everyone around us seemed to be covered especially as we were in jeans and my girlfriend had on a sweater. Also it was strange how a group of ladies were able to order full sized menu items while we weren't allowed to partake with no explanation.  Service: I know it's more of a casual restaurant but you're still working on the strip in a high end casino. Server did his spiel and gave quick unhelpful answers when I asked about the menu which consisted of like 6 things. Like thanks for reading it for me that totally helps in my decision. Kept pushing drinks, when they couldn't even have the decency to give out cold iced water to guests sitting out in the patio. I know it was our choice to sit there but you'd think one would be aware enough to realize maybe the majority of guests outside would enjoy iced water instead of warm water in the sun. I know they make their money from drinks but you don't have to keep pushing after we said we're good the first few times. When we were eating my girlfriend asked for hot sauce and the server responded with \"You mean Tabasco?\" In a condescending tone and proceeded to tell his busser who yelled about it as they both dicked around for a bit before finally taking it out, all while we were still two feet away. The runner did a good job bringing the food out and breaking down the dishes so at least one part was good.   Food: We ordered 4 fish tacos with one being beer battered, Kobe Burgers w/ Fries, and the \"famous\" Buffalo Octopus. The first fish taco was decent that was beer battered while the grilled one was flat, plain, and riddled with bones. Everything was literally soggy and I couldn't tell if I was eating tortilla or fish. Do you know that feeling you have as a kid when your parents make you eat something even though you didn't want to and you're crying as you chew it with tears streaming down your face? That's how I felt with the tacos. The Kobe sliders. I've had angus beef that was better than what was served. For Herringbone to even sell this as \"Kobe\" is a crime. Barely tasted the meat as it was mostly the thick bun which they couldn't decide if they wanted it soft or toasted and at what parts. The Buffalo Octopus was decent with the first bite but afterwards I couldn't tell if I was eating Chicken or Octopus as it was fried so tough that I felt like I was eating a buffalo wing at Bdubs. Honestly the best part of my meal was probably the french fries. Which isn't saying much as it's the same thing you can get at any burger joint.    Thoughts: Herringbone is a chain restaurant spawning from California and I get that. I understand it's more casual. But this is not a high end chain restaurant even though they market and price it as such. You could honestly get better food at Applebees or Chilis. These servers and bussers act entitled for no reason at all. I'm not even sure if what we ate was made by a chef of herringbone or just thrown out to us by the Aria Pool Kitchen. Which I wouldn't be surprised as they are connected. I ended up paying about $80 after tip and I wish I went to Julian Serrano. You go into certain places with a set of expectations with the price point you pay and this place shattered all expectations and runs away with your money all while leaving you feeling sick from questionable fish tacos.",

I was taking back on how approachable and accommodating the head chef was. I have allergies and she made me feel safe. If Sunday brunch is this good i can't wait to come back for dinner.

Herringbone was the best dinner I had on this last Vegas trip, and a place that I'll surely visit again and again in future visits to sin city!  We started at the bar, grabbed a couple of apps and drinks, oysters, chicken wings, champagne, etc, excellence all around. The bartender, Ryan, was super cool, on point, friendly, funny and quick. We ended up grabbing a table and ordering away on the company dime, our table runneth over, so did the bill I'm sure! Everything was stellar, the halibut was fresh, the sauces were amazing, I really enjoyed this dinner.  The ambiance is worth noting, being in the Aria Resort, you would only imagine it being a beautiful place, and it surely is. Right next to the Aria pool, the outdoor deck is where to do it right, cabanas, a tropical setting, great lighting, one of my favorite spots in Vegas!  -Eric Statzer",

Sitting at the bar before the lunchtime crowd really rolled in, Shady and companion had the undivided attention of the staff. They were spot on and amicable. Satrting with a delicious Tuna Poke, there was plenty of tuna for 2. Shady then continued in sharing mode with the Pt judith calamari with peperoncino, which had a nice kick and was cooked perfectly, and the La Jolla fish tacos. Perfect amount for a hungry two-some, and with the  bottles of Rose' Shady was satiated and waddled back to the pool for some more baking. Herringbones' menu had Shady wanting to go back for more, much more, and being that Aria is the go -to spot, Shady will crush more Rose' and Malarkey creations in the near future.",

Why have I not gone out to the one in Santa Monica back home in LA!? This place is really awesome. The seafood is very fresh. The atmosphere was really nice. We were seated outside in the patio with the misters going the heat didn't seem to be there at all. We came for a late dinner almost near closing time and the staff was really awesome in getting us in and not try to rush is through. This is a class act place. I had a taste of the Ora King salmon my kids shared and wow, it was perfectly cooked, I've had a lot of salmon in my life but the grilled salmon they serve here is perfectly seasoned and was moist and flakey delicate really buttery almost. The Brussels pecans were so good sweet and savory balance, not overly sweet either. We also had the lobster Mac n cheese, very decadent and rich but not heavy, I can eat this for days!!!! The clam chowder is the best I've had. I think even better than by all the chowdah places back east. Sorry Beantown there's a new home for Chowder, it's at heringbone, I hope they have this in the Santa Monica branch I would miss this too much if they don't have it. I had the mussels and clams dish, it was very fresh but the only thing I didn't care for was the heavy handedness with salt, the chorizo is already salty, shellfish has a natural brine so a pinch more may have been a pinch much. I didn't want to be one to send it back, I still ate all the shellfish, it was so fresh and smokey flavored from the chorizo. Their drinks were so good, fresh pressed apple juice, I had their special mule, not the Moscow type, wife had her drink and it was tasty but I unfortunately forgot what it was called. I give heringbone 4.99 stars because of the salt in my dish, it's so good here, wish they give fractions for stars because it may have been an honest mistake by the kitchen. The wait staff was really on top of everything, our water glass was never less than 3/4, always full. Amazing. They even had the Dodger game on for me. Cheers guys!",

Our server JASON made the experience so magical AND memorable with his superb customer service skills and attention to detail. I truly believed that IT WAS his pleasure to serve us! Not to mention that the mashed potatoes melted delightfully in your mouth, the melodious blend of herbs and spices on the seafood called you from your table and the drinks, WELL let's just say mixology is definitely a thing. Not even the mini stroke that I suffered shortly after our stay could stop me from making this post. Well done Herringbone, well done! Emory, thank you for the delightful call...proving my point, If you are in Vegas...do your senses a favor and swing on by!",

My husband ordered the filet and he loved it. We share the lobster tower which was good too. I ordered the brazino for $46 which was a huge mistake. I'll give it 1/5 star and don't recommend it to you guys.  I think the price is a bit pricey for the quality of the food. But since I love the atmosphere and happy with their service, I will still come back for lunch or drinks. I probably won't spend big bucks for dinner again.",

    "text": "One word- overrated. I have been to several buffets and this was by far the least impressive. Aria is a phenomenally luxurious hotel and offers great vibes but this buffet could use some help with diversifying its brunch spread to reflect the opulence that this hotel stands for. No brainer why the not-so-fancy looking buffet restaurant next door had a line comparable to those at Disneyland. We came here for a meeting with a client who suggested this restaurant for lunch. It was brunch menu, however, most of the items were seafood. I enjoyed the seafood but that wasn't what I was hoping to binge on for the first meal of the day. Lobster tail were rather small but meat tasted sweet and juicy. Tuna poke was great. I paired it with the nori chips. The salad bar only had a few pre-made bowls of salad, few slices of cheese and lacked variety. Grilled veggie slices were cold and soggy looking. Meat station had New York strip which I wasn't too crazy about. No chicken of any kind on any of the stations. Omelette station was probably the least disappointing. It offered several ingredients to choose from to customize your omelette. Went to drinks station and I couldn't find any coffee, tea etc. Just some pre-made juices in mason jars. I did enjoy the green juice. Dessert station by far was the least impressive. Consisted of some very basic items like strawberry cheesecake, muffins, jelly beans and get this--jolly rancher candies!  Strawberry cheesecake was moderately enjoyable, the rest I didn't care for. Not to sound like a hard-to-please restaurant goer but for the price point and the popularity, I expected far more than what I experienced.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars.  My gf wanted to come here for dinner since it was at where we were staying, located at the Aria hotel. I've been to Herringbone in Santa Monica for brunch and was not a huge fan so was willing to try this location and for dinner. The layout is very nice. Very open space and welcoming. It has a casual and comforting feeling to it. As you walk in there is tables laid out across the room, a bar, and a pretty big outside sitting area. On the side there was more lounging seating, which is where we sat. It was a bit warm but luckily it got slightly cooler as the night progressed.   We were not too hungry for a big entree dinner so we all just grabbed some appetizer and one of the girls and I shared an entree dish, since we needed carbs before a night of drinking.  _Peel & Eat Prawns (We Peel!) ($22) Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce. This pretty much came out like shrimp cocktail. 5 jumbo sized shrimps. They were all fresh and thick, they had a nice bite to it. Served with a cocktail sauce that was sweet and tart. This was good, especially since it was hot outside, but nothing that was really amazing.  _Smoked Trout Caesar ($18) Little gem, soft cooked farm egg, smoked trout dressing, parmesan, croutons. At first this came out way too over drenched in sauce. Not one lettuce was spared from being dressed free. Although the first taste was good, as the dressing was a bit sweet and earthy, I really dislike when there is too much dressing, as it gets wilted. The waiter was nice to bring another one back, but this time it was dry! Maybe I should have just asked for it on the side because I don't think it can be that hard to know how to correctly dress a salad, that's a good portion and balance. The eggs were cooked perfectly, I did not care too much for the trout, but the overall flavor was good. Nothing special but a solid salad.  _Local Mixed Greens ($16) Summer vegetables & berries, herb champagne vinaigrette. Colorful and a well sized salad. Refreshing and light. The summer vegetables were just tomatoes, that were fresh. The berries were sweet and tart, and the vinaigrette was a standard sweet and light dressing. Just a salad, nothing to rave about.  _Whole Fish Ceviche ($27) Branzino, fresno chili, cilantro. This came in a very eye catching and pretty presentation. It was literally the whole fish head and tail on the plate, and the middle sliced into bite size. I can see the art in this as well as the flavor, but for me it was a bit too fishy. The taste had some acidity and tartness to it, but I can taste the fishiness on the back of my palette.  _Yellowtail Crudo ($23) Grapefruit, avocado, serrano. This should have been pretty good as it's a standard dish, but it was pretty bland. For the price point and a place for seafood, I would have expected more flavor. Maybe some ponzu or something.  _Wings ($21) Pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce. This was the BEST dish here, and the main reason why my gf wanted to come here as she mentioned she's had this before. It came out in cute little drumstick shapers which was cute and easier to eat, compared to big ones. The seasoning and depth of flavor in this was amazing. It was sweet, tart, spicy, and acidic, but all complementing one another without overpowering one another. The chicken inside was cooked great and was all well distributed. I'm not big on wings, but this I would eat again and again!  _Spaghetti Ciopinno ($45) San Francisco inspired seafood pasta. I was craving pasta so decided to opt for this. It came with shrimps, scallops, calamari and lobster. Pretty big portion. At first I thought it was bland but the more I ate it, I appreciated the lightness of it. The seafood were all fresh, well cooked and they gave a generous amount, which is always something to look at, especially for the price point. The pasta was well cooked and I love that it had a light tomato sauce to it. I would rather it be a tad under seasoned than overly salty. This was my second fave dish after the wings.   Overall I love the ambience and vibe more than the food. Out of all the dishes we got, only 2 were the best and stood out. For the price point I would think most should stick out. Some hits and misses but a good restaurant to check out if you are staying at the Aria.",

We had Jamie who made us feel welcome and treated us like old friends. As we are not drinkers, the watermelon juice was a delicious alternative. We look forward to returning here soon!",

    "text": "Herringbone is a relatively new restaurant in Aria, brought to us from Brian Malarkey (Top Chef Season 3, a mentor on The Taste, and chef from Seersucker).  Funny how the name Herringbone and Seersucker refer to types of clothing weaves!    We came here for morning brunch, and got seated outdoors under a nice umbrella (with a humidifier!) and surrounded by plants.  It felt like eating at a resort since all the servers were in shorts and there was a huge pool behind us.  We went for the Coastal tasting menu for $55/pp.  Overall pretty good - especially seafood and eggy items.  Kitchen service was a bit slow, but our waiter Rodney was excellent.  Highlights of our brunch:  First Courses: * Appetizer of radishes with sea salt and honey butter - crispy and the flavor combo kinda works.  * Poke - wow pretty fresh yellowtail with shoyu, Maui onion, and mac nuts.  They offered some flat bread that reminded me of green onion pancakes that was quite good and perfect for scooping up the poke.  * Shrimp Ceviche - more on the tart side from the Clamato and salsa, but lots of shrimp!  They added some nice guac and used saltines for scooping up the ceviche.  Second Course: * Crab Benny - Instead of something on an English muffin, this was two cakes of lumped crab meat with two perfectly cooked sous vide farm eggs. We liked this dish, especially that runny egg which is like having more sauce for the crab cakes.  * Bobby Sliders - Named after ex-poker legend Bobby Baldwin (and now Casino Exec at Aria), these were Kobe beef with some aged cheddar that added some sweetness to the sliders.  Pretty good as well!  Dessert: * Fresh fruit platter had a nice variety - mango, watermelon, strawberry, pineapple, and a rambutan! The whipped yogurt sauce underneath was nice and sweet.  Definitely recommend coming here for brunch, but only if you're not in a big hurry.  Seafood dishes seem on point here.",

    "text": "We went for brunch today. It is all you can eat for $59.00 per person and this does not include alcohol. The cheapest bottomless option was $35.00 extra or more. That would mean $95.00 minimum.   The good: I liked the food. We ordered the chilaquiles, fish tacos, and sweet crepes from the kitchen. All were very good. I was not so crazy about the other options from the kitchen and there were only a few to choose from. The brunch included a bread, carving, and omelette section at one end, and a salad station and dessert station at another end, and a seafood section by the first station. They were all over the place.   The bad: I was disappointed with service. I had to keep asking for coffee after my cup being empty for well over 15 minutes. The latte I initially ordered before the regular coffee was way more a cappuccino than a latte. Yet that was mild compared to the fact that this was our first time having brunch there and our server did not tell us where all the stations were or even explain the brunch to us. Due to this, we missed the Bloody Mary station and the salad station. We only knew about the dessert station after my friend asked if she can see a menu for dessert. We knew about the bread/carving/omelette station as we were sat right next to it. We knew about the small seafood station as it was behind us. The salad and dessert and Bloody Mary areas were way on the other side of an angled restaurant that is packed so easily missed if not told about it. We did not bother with the Bloody Mary station or salad station as we already ate when we found out about it. This is the first restaurant where our server did not ask us if we knew where everything was. I suppose this is why I could not believe how expensive the price was for what we knew of. I was disappointed in what I believed was way overpriced for what you get.   There are way better brunches in the city that have way better service, better food, and better prices.  The ambiance is busy, and at times the music playing overhead was way too loud.",

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and on one of the nights while we were there, we wanted to go out to a fancy dinner.  As we were walking through Aria during the day, we fell upon Herringbone.  We made a 6:30pm reservation and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  Appetizer - Wings:  The waiter mentioned that their Hot Fare and Cold Fare dishes were small but when the wings came out - there were 12 pieces and it was DELICIOUS.  A bit spicy - but overall tasty and my boyfriend and I finished them all.  Main Dishes - Chilean Sea Bass and the Lamb Chops:  The sea bass had the right amount of sweet and spicy.  The sauce was a coconut sauce which was my favorite.  The stir fry vegetables were cooked perfectly and matched well with the fish.  The lamb chops was a special on the menu and this was probably the best dish of the night.  My boyfriend asked for the lamb chops to be medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The added touch of the radish sauce was perfect.  Both dishes were quite big and filling.  You would think that since it was a fancy restaurant the dishes would be small - but Herringbone got it right.  It was a great large portion for the price.    Side dish - \"Death by Potatoes:\"  It was practically mashed potatoes with bacon as an added topping.  The potatoes had a perfect texture and it was a nice touch to both of our main dishes.    We sat outside - which had a very nice ambiance.  (And had outdoor heaters -- which was very helpful since it was a bit chilly that night!)  Overall - LOVE this restaurant and I would highly recommend if you're ever in Vegas and visiting/staying at Aria!",

I wasn't quite sure what \"brunch club\" entailed, and even after leaving I never really got the \"club\" vibe, but perhaps dining outside is a little bit crazier? Although in 113F weather, dining outside must be nuts lol.   The set up was half buffet and half small plates to order.  We did what all normal people do and ordered every single small plate, and then proceeded to fill up on unlimited Vueve and buffet, that we couldn't really eat the small plates lol.... whoops.    Overall, good vibes.  Not the most amazing brunch, but service was good, some items were outstanding and the place was fun.    BIGGEST COMPLAINT - the serving tongs/forks whatever they are on the buffet items were pretty much useless and I had a hard time using them.",

I ordered the Day Boat Halibut and the fish was amazing, the vegetables were perfectly cooked, and then they pour the tamarind sauce on top. Service is great as well.

    "text": "Chose this venue as a mothers day eve dinner, and it certainly did not disappoint. Jamie was very friendly and fun to converse with and give orders too. The patio is a nice place to have dinner; the slight breeze was nice on a hot May eve....Ok heres the rundown: Start with a small complimentary serving of salmon on a bed of dill sauce and cucumber, one small pc per person. I had the chilean seas bass, it was very good.  a nice chunky filet with a tasty sauce plated. $45 Wife had the branzino; perfectly grilled she loved it; ditto on the price. Oysters (12pc) were great but quite overpriced, $50+ including tax, not worth it. Shouldnt be more than 35 bucks, but hey its the LV. Tuna poke with nori chips was delish, also coming in at a hefty 25 bucks for a small/medium portion. Death by potatoes= another appetizzy, its just mashed potatoes with thick cut cubed bacon (not a fan of taste or texture) but the rest was good tasting. Pricey as fuck; even without alcohol blew 3 bills. Good dinner though. They have seafood towers too if you want to take out a second mortgage.",

I had the tomato salad and I did not see there was cheese on it on the menu. Did not sent it back but move the cheese on the side since I was afraid they end up on the trash. I asked they have something vegan as a main course and the waitress told me they can make the pasta Carbonara vegan. To be honest I found it surprising but not even discuss and ordered immediately. The pasta arrive and described at \"Vegan Carbonara\" .. humm... more like forest mushrooms with pasta soaking in oil. Good but not great. Due to my previous experiences in this restaurant, I'll give 4 stars, but I think having couple healthy, vegetarian and Vegan items on the menu will not hurt.",

Came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and I had high hopes for this place and Herringbone did not disappoint. We did the brunch buffet. Our waitress, Jenna, was absolutely superb! She was so nice and made sure everything was to our liking. She went above and beyond and brought sissy a dessert for her birthday and even gave us a rose. 3 freaking roses. Who does that?! I've gone to some of the top restaraunts in Vegas for multiple occasions and just for fun and I've never had the experience that Jenna gave us.  There were cute stations all over the restaraunt, cold statio.-shrimp (cooked to perfection, I could have eaten a lot more shrimp but refrained cause I wanted dessert), poke (didn't try since I'm preggers but my table said it was the best) and crab legs open faced. I love how they have cocktail sauce and you can control the heat with the side of horseradish. I do wish there were little cups to hold the sauce on the side though, I don't like things to mix. Beverage station included in price and of course you can upgrade your package to have more alcohol and bottomless alcohol as well. Salad station was good, I really enjoyed their caesar. The hot station had lamb, pork and something else. But I pretty devoured the baked salmon. Omg, it was so creamy and not over cooked. The guys behind the hot station were so nice and made a delish shrimp omelette. You can also order from the kitchen. Fish tacos were good. Loco moco was good except my meat patty was dry, slightly disappointed in that.... but I will be coming back to get more from the kitchen and will let you know how it is! The staff was so great, our plates were always picked up, water always full, and I just loved it here. I will have to come back when it's cooler to sit outside.  Oh and I almost forgot  The dessert bar! Candy to woopie pies to cannolis to every fat kids dream.",

The hostesses told us they had a private event and won't be seating in the dining area until 10 pm, so we decided to sit at the bar. During this whole interaction with them, I couldn't help but think how a new-ish restaurant could put such rude, unprofessional staff at the front of the house. First impression FAIL.  The only decent part about this restaurant was the food. Everything else was just a huge disappointment... you are nothing without service!  Anyway, we ordered: x Roasted Mushrooms (Cipollini Onions, Herbs) - probably my favorite of the night.  x Spanish Octopus (Salsa Verde, Roasted Red Pepper, Preserved Lemons) - bursting with flavor and so tender. Super good with the cheesy bread, but almost better separately. x Yellowtail (Sweet Mango, Jalapeno Salsa, Radish, Micro Greens) - BLAND. The fish was very dry.. needed some sort of citrus or liquid component. x Lobster Tortellini (Squid Ink Pasta, Soffritto) - another bland/dry dish. I was super excited to splurge on some unneeded calories, but this failed me :( The tortellini itself felt under cooked and the sauce was lacking in flavor.  I want to come back to try their drinks... but I'm so annoyed with my visit here I just can't.",

The way they prepared it made it so easy to pull the meat from the shell. It was almost effortless. Highly recommend this.  We also had the crab cake poppers ($19) and the clam chowder ($14). Both were just ok. If crab cake is what you are looking for, go to Brian Malarkey's other restaurant Searsucker in Caesars. I had the best crab cake there.  The grilled chicken sandwich ($18) was underwhelming. Ora king salmon ($34) was cooked perfectly but the sweet sauce that it comes with ruined it for me. I just don't think sweet goes with salmon. For about the same price, I would rather have gotten another order of the lobster.  I did have a really good non-alcoholic drink here. It was called Umbrella Not Included ($8). It was a mix of pineapple, pomegranate, lime, orgeat and ginger ale. One of the better mocktails I've had.  For dessert we had the panna cotta ($12). It was prettier than it tasted.  I felt prices were kinda high here for the level of food they're serving.  I would just come back for drinks and the lobster.",

Half the tables at the restaurant were empty, but the hostess insisted on sitting us at the bar because she claimed that the \"good\" tables were reserved. I guess that our reservation was not \"good enough\" for her. We insisted to be sited at the main restaurant. She came back after talking to the manager for 10 min saying that she can sit us at the lounge area, and that the main floor is reserved for \"special\" people. I guess we were not special enough for her, so we turned around  to leave. Then as we were leaving the place, she runs after us and tells us that it's ok and she can after all sit us on the main floor. At this point we are totally weirded out by this joint, but we decide to stay and see how this circus plays out.  I mean this is Las Vegas after all, the to experience all things weird. Next thing the waitress shows up. As expected by now her facial expression totally matches the rest of the place: detached, pretentious and weird. We order some food, pay the bill and can't wait to get out of this joke of a joint. Of course , as we leave and look around the place is still half empty, all those empty tables still waiting for the \"special\" people to show up. We walk pass the hostess table and hear how she is telling another party that there are no available tables on the main floor and that she can only sit them at the bar. I do hope that this restaurant disappears from the face of the earth by the time I visit Las Vegas again.",

Really should state these things at the beginning, as making a choice at ordering is not the best.  Food was good, but not excellent. Mixed drinks seem to have very little alcohol.

    "text": "At first glance, this restaurant looks more like a chic lounge. There are couches that fill the walls along with a few tables in the center. The lights are dimmed as the night on, and the atmosphere is lively.   Once we were seated, we were all handed the menu. First introduced to their wide variety of clever-named cocktails and wines. I stuck with water the whole night. We first ordered the herb (truffle) fries (about $8/order). They were crisp, and a bit addicting when dipped in the aoili. For the entree I decided to go with the wings, as they are a very popular order. I split them amongst my boyfriend, so we got two orders. The food didn't take too long considering I was dining with a large party of 9! (Who mostly ordered steak.) The wings were delicious and packed with flavor. Though they were a whopping $18/order, I couldn't complain about the quality. I was also able to taste the steak as well as the 18-oz rib-eye ($62), and \"Death by Potatoes\" ($9). The steak was incredibly tender, and I had wished I ordered it. The potatoes were very creamy, and also packed with flavor. Next we had our desserts. All were unique from the other. The Cheesecake Mouse was my favorite.  I recommend Herringbone if you are looking for a place on the strip that doesn't feel touristy. A place where the prices are a little high, but the food is worth the price. You get what you pay for, and in this case...you get a wonderful meal.",

Small portions except for the pancakes.. You definitely don't leave full.  However, the issue was the service.  Even though the restaurant was not full we waited about 15 minutes for the table to be set up with a reservation.  The waitress brought us desert menus before the entrees were even served, so she clearly wasn't paying much attention.  No one came back to ask how we were doing after we did finally get the food.  One person in the party asked for more bread and they forget that request as well.  Overall ok but not impressed with the service and with $20+ breakfast entrees I don't want to leave hungry.",

It took about 10 minutes to get my 3oz empty glass filled with water. It took another 17 minutes for a waiter to come over and take an order. All the time crazy thirsty because no drink refills. I asked one of the 4 different staff that came by the table what the fish of the day was and never got an answer. Finally asked for the check and proceeded to go downstairs to the Thai place which was excellent. Never again herring bone",

The specialty cocktail I ordered was OK- would have liked to try the mule but the bartender flatly stated \"can't make it\". Well, could you say why and give suggestions? There was a lot of waiting, not a lot of communication despite there being several hosts...we had to get up from the bar and walk back over to the host to be seated. Luckily, we were seated at a great table and the food was amazing. We ordered lobster and crab legs. I didn't like the sweet clarified butter, I would have requested something else but no one really checked on us until the end. There was a younger gentleman who helped us a bit. I would like to come back, just not that late in the evening. The outdoor seating area is really worth the visit. However, I would rather be turned away than have a mediocre experience at a fairly upscale restaurant like this one- so I can go elsewhere and have a better quality experience.",

Thought the seafood pasta dish was excellent with the right amount of zing to its tasty sauce and ample fish, shrimp, etc.  The sea bass on the other hand was a disaster.  It was very dry presumably because it was grossly overcooked, and lacked flavor.   Rib eye steak was tasty but a step down from a real quality steak house.  Tried some appetizers including the salmon cold dish, and was not at all impressed with the chefs attempt to turn the salmon into something special ( I consider myself a sushi connoisseur ).   Had a Mac n cheese side dish and was somewhat surprised to find small bits of pineapple floating throughout.  In my opinion the pineapple was not a pleasant surprise and simply detracted from a dish that I consider rich comfort food.  In retrospect I should have sent the sea bass back, but felt my doing so would impact our guests who were here from Korea.",

They overdid it with tv's on the indoor lounge, every wall and every corner. Dinner is served outside. Friendly vibe from the wait staff. Ordered the Yacht which is a great appetizer boat of lobster, shrimp, king crab and oysters. Four of us pretty much enjoyed our branzini, skate and sea bass. Hostess needs further training instead of letting people wait outside since only 3 of us were present for the 6 pm reservations, she said - \"you have to wait until everyone arrives\". A good suggestion would  have been \"you're welcome to go to the bar and have a drink while waiting for the last guest\" which we did anyway so we all walked to the bar and ordered our drinks. We observed further how crowded the hostess area became as more and more people were just standing there and waited. The lounge is humongous and weren't filled with people. Guests should have been made comfortable plus a bar bill would have been good for the register!",

After seeing such positive reviews from other Yelpers, I knew I needed to try it for myself and let me just say, it's worth all the hype! The Brunch Club tasting menu included many small tapas-like plates, our favorite was the chicken wings! So crunchy and yet covered in the perfect amount of sweet chili sauce. The fish tacos were also great, though the beef sliders were nothing to write home about.   The many brunch tables offered so many incredible options and everything we tried was delicious! Don't skip the fresh oysters on the half shell, tuna poke, and other fresh seafood! The breakfast options and carving table were phenomenal, and the blueberry smoothie and fresh watermelon juice were perfect palate cleansers between rounds at the buffet! And of course, the desserts were perfect little bites! Our favorites were the key lime tarts and chocolate covered chocolate-mousse/brownies on a stick.  Ask to sit on the patio for a laid back and tropical ambiance with a fantastic DJ!  The service was probably the best and most attentive I've experienced at any brunch, and the servers were all friendly and willing to accommodate any and all of our requests.  We will most definitely be back, we are in love with Herringbone!",

But the fisherman's stew really caught my eye for the variety of fish in it. It had calamari, shrimp, halibut, and mussels. It also had chorizo, which was a good touch! It came with a crostini with this deliciously spicy harissa-esque spread on top. The crostini was the perfect softness for dipping and soaking up all the amazing sauce of the stew.  We got potatoes and cauliflower on the side, which were soooo good. The potatoes were super creamy and cheesy. They were loaded with butter and cheese but it was so worth it. The potatoes came with pancetta, which was the best pancetta I think I have ever had. It was crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and super savory. The cauliflower was also incredible. It had these amazing capers that complemented the vegetable quite nicely.  To top off this amazing meal, they brought us tons of complimentary flatbread to start. AND! They brought us this beautiful tray of desserts, for free, because it was my friend's bachelorette. The staff were so unbelievably kind and helpful, too.   No qualms about this place. I'm eager to head over to the one in Santa Monica to get another taste!",

You can sit inside or outside depending on the weather. I choose to sit inside because it was too hot to sit outside. The servers all worked together and were very attentive down to the manager.   The food was also amazing! I had their yacht seafood platter with the tomatoes and avocado salad and it was all amazing.

The service was so great and genuine, I wrote a novel before I can even begin to talk about the food!   The buffet style brunch is amazing! The seafood in this buffet is so fresh and so full of quality it's disgustingly good! When I think of buffet seafood, I think of low quality fish and shrimp and shellfish etc! Not here! The shrimp might as well be on steroids they're so large! And the lobster tail was phenomenal! I can brag forever, but if you couldn't already tell by my lengthy review, it's a must try!

Sarcasm aside, it's a no brainer to look elsewhere for good buffets when you're right on the strip. Came here for a client meeting with my girlfriend and did not enjoy this meal. While there is a decent selection of seafood, there is only a scant amount of meat selection and other sides such as vegetables. There are only a few salads in their \"salad bar\" and the create your own omelette section was average. The desserts were nice though. My girlfriend teased me as I passed on the delicious cheesecake initially for jolly ranchers (yes they had jolly ranchers) Total bill was $200 for three people. I expect better for that amount and the location.",

We could not have been happier during our time at Herringbone. This restaurant was recommended to us by my brother and his wife. We had a wonderful experience; from the food, to ambiance, to the full staff.  We ordered a collection of things that our server recommended: Mary's roasted half chicken, wings, brussels & pecans (favorite!), and local mixed greens. Along with our meal we ordered a bottle of champagne. Everything tasted delicious.  We were seated outdoors and it was so incredibly romantic. They really did a great job of making it feel like we were the only ones there. We will definitely be back every time we visit the city. Thank you to the staff who made our evening so wonderful!",

Only thing we ate that we weren't fans of was the shrimp and grits. We'll skip the bottomless mimosas next time as well. Unless you're planning on just hanging out for hours it just isn't worth it.

Unfortunately, we are before we came (they don't open until 10). So we weren't hungry for food. They do however, offer a bottomless mimosa/Bloody Mary package. For $35 each, you drink as much as you'd like: bellinis, mimosas, or bloody Mary's. We definitely drank as much as our body's could handle!   The servers were awesome, to say the least. They ensured we really enjoyed our visit. If you only get the drink package, you have to sit at the indoor or outdoor bar- vs. a table. The outside bar was perf bc it was a beautiful day. Our bartender even brought us a lil' sample of the crab legs from the brunch buffet!! We'll definitely come back to this restaurant- with an appetite on our next visit to Vegas!",

    "text": "Do you ever go to a restaurant and it hits you so damn hard that you can't wait to tell the world? Well, Herringbone made me feel exactly that way... I just had to sober up first.   I can only speak for their Sunday brunch, but as far as I'm concerned, they don't ever have to do anything else. The food was excellent, the format was awesome, and the staff was unreal! I know what you're thinking, \"please elaborate, Brad.\" Okay, I will, friends.   All you can eat and drink brunches are a dime a dozen in any city, which typically consist of cheap bottomless Champagne and a slew of overheated and overstuffed chaffing dishes. You spend a few bucks and walk away feeling gross. Not here... oh man, not here.   You want to win my heart? Scrap the Champagne at brunch and serve me vodka. How about bottomless Tito's? Done! My cocktail was never empty of my admittedly boring drink, Tito's/soda with lime and for those that jumped on the Champagne train, well, they were drinking bottomless bottles of Veuve Clicquot. Yeah, who cares if they have food, right? Wrong! The food was also incredible.   As I mentioned earlier in this ever-growing review, the format was killer. You could hit the main room for the carving station, crab legs, jumbo shrimp, oysters, a build-your-own lettuce wrap station, desserts, and a whole lot of other things, but the menu items were also included as AYCE items as well. Let me tell you, those chicken wings... oh boy, those chicken wings. Also, let's not overlook the shrimp and grits, the ricotta pancakes, and the French toast - all were big, BIG winners.   The staff gets their own paragraph here, most specifically Shadi, and I can say with 100% confidence that I butchered her name. While we often think our dining groups are fun and easygoing, you'll often hear the opposite from the staff if you ask them. She said she loved us and I'd like to think that's True, but only because I want that feeling to be reciprocated. Why? Because we absolutely loved her! Her patience, her humor, her prompt service, and her overall relaxed and pleasant demeanor. She's as good as they get and she could write a book on handling a needy/high-energy table. Herringbone is lucky to have her and she sure does seem happy coming into the \"office\" on a Sunday morning suggesting that Herringbone is equally as good to her. Let's not forget Megan who had fun as the tie-breaking judge of our super-serious-plating-competition and also to Chef Andrew who even found some humor in putting us on his Instagram story - that s#it was TIIIIIGHHHHT!   So, can you tell I loved this place? So much that I've even tossed the idea to some friends to fly in and out of Vegas on an upcoming Sunday simply for the brunch. Epic man, truly epic!",

We had Veuve Clicquot at $65 a head.  Must have drunk 2 bottles each!  They have superb seafood including oysters, lobsters, king prawn & crab legs.  Carvery of beef, lamb, turkey and ham along with excellent charcuterie board and dessert station.  You can also order from a choice of 10 fresh a la carte options.  Must choose Parmesan crispy fries with truffle zest and fish tacos.  Our experience was enhance by Peter our server.  His personality and keen eye for service made our visit even more memorable.  Ask for Peters section when you arrive.  We even had a chance to say hi to the restaurant manager Douglas who welcomed us and made us feel at home.  Great service, great food and great venue!",

It was hot outside and even though they were misters our water would take about 15 minutes to be refilled in between each glass of water. If you knew you had customers outside you would be on top of refilling the water is in making sure there is refreshed as possible. There weren't that many tables seeing as though it was lunch hours and but still were receiving extremely slow service from our waitress. It was also my birthday and I felt I was treated as if I was only going to order water and an appetizer. We ordered well over a few hundred dollars worth of food and I had to ask multiple different people for glasses of water and where the location of my waitress was at multiple times. Mark was exceptional, he was not our server but he did step in and help her out with her four top table.",

Why the F does this restaurant have a DJ anyway?  This restaurant was your typical undersized overpriced tourist tax. I got the octopus and the lobster fried rice.  Unfortunately so much time went by between the two I regretted my choice. The octopus was a little tough. Not awful but if I'm laying that much I expect better. The lobster fried rice was ok with its three tiny over cooked pieces of lobster. I don't know what I was expecting though.   They comped us dessert for the wait but the damage had been done. Mostly the damage to my hearing. Seriously if there is no dance floor and no strippers why is there a DJ?",

My girlfriends ordered a myriad of things and our bill ended up being nearly $500. But due to my diet restrictions, I only tried 2 dishes.  Oysters - Delicious! This was my first time trying oysters EVER (my friends literally bullied me into it) and I was like oh, oysters are pretty good! I have since had them at several other places so I can say the ones at Herringbone and very fresh-tasting. Also I really liked the kimchee salsa they are served with. They also come with apple mignonette, lemon, Tabasco, and spicy cocktail sauce.  White Sea Bass - I ordered this because I did my research on Yelp first and this dish received rave reviews. The server also recommended it. It was good but far from amazing. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked and the dish simply isn't memorable at all. I wouldn't order this again.  The numerous other dishes ordered by my friends (Death by Potatoes, Whole Fish Ceviche, Herb Fries, etc) were enjoyed by all of them. We also had an awesome waitstaff that brought us out a free round of shots and a surprise birthday dessert for my friend, also free of charge. Even though it was a great experience, I'm not dying to come back for some reason. It must be because I didn't like my entree too much. If I return, I'll try the scallops! Oh, and I'll definitely order the oysters again!",

Chris was our server and he was very friendly, making excellent recommendations for drinks for the whole party. Some highlights we enjoyed were the Drifting Mistress (excellent whiskey drink with Yamazaki 12 yr), Truffle Shuffle (another really good whiskey drink), the burrata (the tables favorite), wings (lollipop bone so really easy to eat and a good Thai flavor), along with the tuna poke. All of the dishes had such different flavors, but every single one was absolutely delicious. The service was second to none and it was exactly what we were looking for as far as great food and drinks outside when the weather was perfect.   The second visit, we chose to sit at the bar and enjoy just drinks. I brought more girlfriends along and they're now raving about the place! Jonathon and Michael were our bartenders and they were definitely an expert in their field. So personable and friendly!  With my first two visits being that great, I Can't wait to join for a third time and experience the full dinner menu.",

Very relaxed but very chic too.  We were in group and the party started well, with a hands on DJ playing the 80 -90s music. Which to me was very apt as most of customers were in that age group.  Now the bar, really well stocked with some high-end single malts and cocktails. The food is the only thing, we felt was a little below par given all the good stuff around you. Its not bad, but just bit all over the place, menu is based on California style, which to me says all seafood - not many seafood options. Overall, the experience has was great and will recommend this spot for good time with friend, party, great single malts on offer with good (not great) food.",

Our waiters Michelle and Lorenzo were very kind and accommodating and when out of their way to make our experience enjoyable. My favorite dishes were the poke, the salmon, the seaweed chips, and orange chocolate chip ricotta pancake. If you want great food and service, I highly recommend Herringbone!",

When returned at five the new hostess asked if we where having dinner we said no just appetizers. She then mentioned that there was no need for that hour wait since we weren't having dinner. Which was completely annoying since we were so hungry. Service was horrible and food was ok. I really wanted to like this place because the outside sitting area is adorable.   I ordered the shrimp ceviche nothing special I've had better. My boyfriend ordered the tuna poke which was good but the fried tortilla chips that came with it was greasy and chewy so we asked for crackers instead. To drink i had a michealada which wasn't very good either. The one I ordered at the pool outside was way better.",

Saying all that the food was exceptionally good and I seem to be contradicting everyone else opinion about the service and I must note the restaurant was only a 1/4 full so it wasn't like they needed the table and we spent over $160 US it's not like we ordering bread crumbs & water James Sydney",

I had the seafood spaghetti. Fresh spaghetti, half was prepared with squid ink, shrimp, lobster and scallops. Absolutely delicate, pasta cooked to perfection, and seasoning just the way it should be. The scallop portions were generous as well! It was served with 3 large scallops   Already worth the $42+ price of the dish. Normally scallops this big are an entree for the same price at other places. Additionally, the portions for this dish were quite large! Good work. Compliments to the chef for this dish.   Apologies for the blurry photos. I tried to adjust as we were seated outside for dinner. Dim lighting for a lovely atmosphere.   Overall great seafood, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere at the Aria.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this place (like many others here) but it felt like a miss to me.  We walked in and we're seated right away at a great table - a party of 11. The reason for the 3 stars is while we sat down at 12:40 for lunch, our main courses came after 2 pm. No one really came to check on us or let us know when food is coming. No one even said sorry it's taking so long, is there anything I can do for you?  We ordered 2 soups and I got the lunch box with small salad and choice of \"main\".   Things I liked: the \"no umbrellas\" drink (no alcohol) but that the cup was full of ice, and it was $8 for juice. I also really liked their take on the Caesar salad with smoked trout.  Things I didn't like: I got the chicken sandwich with tomato and burrata. The sandwich overall was pretty bland and my chicken was charred to death. I mean it was bad. But food took 1.5 hrs and I couldn't wait for something else. Also the 3 hours of indigestion that followed lead me to believe that while the sandwich was charred, it may not have been cooked all the way through.  More bad: I didn't like that there were no \"brunch\" items on the menu. What I really didn't like is that as a seafood restaurant, the only seafood option I saw was the seafood tower. The other options were a burger, a nasty chicken sandwich, tacos that people at our table didn't enjoy, and something else uninspired.  So slow slow slowwwww service plus mediocre food plus prices that are way too high make for a place I don't want to try again. Sorry guys, there are way better restaurants and brunch places in Vegas.",

The chefs in this restaurant care about the food they prepare. I have eaten and travelled all over the world but the seafood pasta I had was one of the best dishes I've ever experienced. Extremely flavorful with large quantities of high value seafood ingredients such as lobster and large shrimp. My wife's fish fillet was delicately prepared and not over cooked.   The restaurant itself is somewhat disappointing. It has a bit of a sports bar feel with lots of tv screens and you can view the indoor mall.  But, ignore all of that and go there for great seafood and you will totally forget you are actually in a desert.",

Unfortunately, my time there was overshadowed with a tragedy. On the night of my birthday, we decided to venture around the Aria to see if anything piqued our interest for dinner and we thankfully stumbled upon Herringbone. When the staff heard about our story, they decided to treat us like a king and queen all night! Thanks to our wonderful server, Jamie, our amazing Chef, Jonathan, and the generous Manager, Doug, we were able to forget about the bad in the world and we were reminded that love is so much stronger than hate. Everything we had that night was beyond delicious and I could not have asked for a better way to spend my birthday. I highly recommend Herringbone, not just for their top notch food options, but because their staff is one of a kind. Keep up the great work guys, we will totally be back when we plan out Vegas do-over trip!",

The pasta was flawless...agnolotti with butternut squash had a nice touch of sweetness and the tortellini was top notch.

    "text": "Was staying out at Lake Las Vegas to avoid crowds and the insanity of the strip but my wife wanted to go get a nice brunch so we ended up at Herringbone. A little pricey to say the least especially if you get the drink add on menu. The service was friendly and the food was exceptional. The seafood station is incredible. Oysters. Crab. Lobster. Ventured over to get some carved smoked duck. Glad i walked over there instead of staying at the seafood section. The stations are small and thats a good thing. If you want to gorge on mediocre food go to a buffet. This place is also a great people watching joint as there are plenty of trendy wannabes to look at. Dj plays some good music and its not loud so you can relax and enjoy your time.",

Wow, we started off with the marinated grilled octopus pair with a bottle of white wine. Amazing!!! Could have had an entire plate by myself although it did have a good amount for two. Then we had one of the entrees for two, pound and half of lobster, assorted dozen of oysters, being my first time... Excellent and jumbo shrimp, ginormous king crab legs, along with eight dipping sauces; then ended with the most amazing deliciously Nutella ice cream over bed of hazelnut/chocolate in pastry style desert that was unbelievable. I am not sure how our dinner could have been more perfect. They take reservations and service was stellar!",

Made the meal the worst of the trip. Not only did our drinks take at least 15 min to get we had to find the server to place our order. Then our food took forever. The server then proceeded to bring us shots to \"make up\" for the fact that he was not around. He said he was taking care of the president of the hotel so had to cater to him. So I'm paying $$$$$ to his company and you cater to him?? No won't be going back or recommending them. Oh and we women have worked in the industry. Those poor tips you didn't even deserve them.",

It looked so inviting and perfect for brunch but the crazy blustery winds did not cooperate and we asked to be moved inside which they accommodated immediately without hesitation. Ian was our waiter and we couldn't have asked for a more energetic and attentive waiter! We had egg ravioli - delicious. The loco moco (Hawaii inspired) was mediocre - taste so much better in Hawaii. The orange pancakes with chocolate bacon was very good. The fried green tomato sandwich with housemade potato chips was good. The herringbone ice cream sunday was just as yummy as Ian had promised. Complimentary cheesecake with a birthday candle was a nice surprise too. Our experience at Herringbone was great because Ian is  very good at making one feel special when dining.",

I had high hopes for Herringbone, the menu looked interesting, the decor and ambiance was pleasant, really liked the outdoor seating area, and the service was nice enough. But the kitchen was bad, really bad! We waited an hour to get our food, and when the food finally arrived, half the order was wrong, more waiting. Most of the tables did not have food, though the waiters did a good job of refilling drinks. I might've overlooked the long wait if the food tasted phenomenal, but it was not at all. The egg & bacon ravioli was mediocre, the chilaquiles was underwhelming, and the avocado toast was inedible. It's served cold so the \"toast\" was basically stale bread, that was so hard that the knife won't slice through it, and it cut the roof of my mouth. Looking around, I noticed 2 other tables that left half the avocado toast untouched. The presentation is beautiful to look at, but their food isn't made for good eating. For a Vegas strip restaurant, this place really does not cut it.",

Hearing about how good Herringbone is and looking at the pictures, we wanted try it out. We have tried almost every restaurant in Aria and love them all. Also Raos in Caesars Palace. We walked to Herringbone on a Sat at 1230pm for lunch/brunch. We walked up to the host and I told them party of 3..She looked at my daughter n immediately told me its 21 and over only. I said ok then..and walked over to Bardot for brunch. The host did not give us any explanation on why, but for a restaurant at 1230 pm, in the afternoon, for brunch, to be for 21 and over only...what is that all about??? Never heard of such a thing. It's not we were going there at 10pm where I know some restaurants turn into a night club or some sort..but at 1230 pm in the afternoon??? Really Herringbone..Well..it's no loss for me, there are plenty of other restaurants I can choose from in Aria.. Herringbone...you guys might want to rethink your policy since a lot of families that visit Vegas have kids and you are losing a lot of valuable customers. Anyways you have lost one valuable customer here..I won't be visiting your establishment again.",

Everything including the atmosphere, the service, food and cocktails is such a fabulous place to dine on the strip. A couple things that stuck out I would have to say were the watermelon salad with feta cheese, arugula and tomatoes, the brussels and pecans, and the whole grilled Branzino. The salad was very light and refreshing. I wouldn't say I normally like fruit in my salad, but everything complimented each other and made it delicious. I'm on this brussel sprout kick right now, so as soon as I saw those on the menu I had to try them and they were perfect. I loved that they were the right amount of crispy, the pecans were in the mix and whatever sauce the chef used was really good. Truly the best brussel sprouts I have tried yet. I only eat fish and I feel like I've tried my fair share, but it always seems like I usually get caught up in ordering the salmon or the sea bass. This time I told myself I'd try something new, so I ordered the Branzino. Such a great choice and I'm so glad I decided to try something different.   Thank you Chef Geno for a delightful meal and I can't wait to dine in again!",

    "text": "Chef Geno delivers this menu in spectacular fashion.   Was in town for a conference and had a large group of about 10 and needed something great as we also had a birthday to celebrate. I was a huge fan of Chef Geno's when he was at Nove and was really excited to hear he was back in town.   Because we were a large group, I think we ordered almost every appetizer and shared them around the table. It was one whimsical and tasty bite after another.   Dinner was no different. Everyone raved about their dishes.   Inside seating may not be for everyone, but if you have an evening conducive to sitting outside (which most nights in Vegas are), the Patio is amazing.   Great service and ambience were icing on the cake.   Vegas has a new contender for top restaurant and if the overall restaurant is the contender, then Chef Geno is still one of the top trainers in the business!   Don't miss a chance to eat here - I will be back in Vegas in May and plan to stop in for sure.",

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday afternoon, and I really love the great patio it has.  While we were waiting for our table, we had a drink at the bar.  I saw the bartender make a green juice for someone else, and asked what it was.  It was a cucumber/apple/chili pepper juice, and I asked him to make me one also.  I LOVED IT, the pepper had a really nice spiciness to it.  The bartenders were really nice and attentive while we waited.    We ordered a few things to share: grilled octopus appetizer, crab benedict, branzino ceviche.  They were all really good- great flavors.  I did take a star away because of the service.  It looked like maybe at the time we were there they had one server for the entire inside and one for the outside... so it was a bit slow and hard to find our server sometimes.  Overall great food and atmostpherre!",

Sitting here are initial half hour we were at a half not even a full star the service was not great they couldn't tell us if they could get just a steak for our daughter and a couple other little hick ups. We contemplated leaving and going to another restaurant at which point we expressed how unhappy we were. They sent over the assistant manager  Oliver whom I have to say completely redeemed not only the restaurant but our overall experience. His attention to detail and turning around our entire experience was something that changed our overall opinion and has now brought our rating up to four stars the food was incredible.  The oysters were absolutely amazing and we highly recommend both the East Coast and the West Coast the branzino was excellent As was the lobster. Dessert was a sin. The mars capones cheesecake was to die for. C u soon",

Gorgeous place to host a group of friends (long tables and U shaped lounge areas with couches and tables. Shaded area with pool views.  Drinks are tasty.  I am gluten free and they let me order a salad as opposed to the brunch option or a la carte.    Recommended for Brunch especially if you are going to enjoy more than 2 drinks (one is $18 and endless is $35.)  My bf has fish tacos that come either grilled or beer battered... and he was satisfied.  The boardwalk fries are a little too crispy for my liking, but the malt vinegar aoli is TDF.

We sat at the bar and Brandon took great care of us. He is super friendly and helpful and he made the best margaritas for my husband's birthday and they have a beer on tap called El Jeffe and it is a beer with chile flavor steeped in. Really different and good.  The chef does specials for Monday night football and we were there for Chicago vs Minnesota so we each had one of the specials. Chicago was a loose take on the Chicago dog- bacon wrapped hot dogs with pico de gallo and cotija cheese, it was really good and a new hot dog flavor for me. The Minnesota special was a juicy lucy and it was amazing. For great food and service come to Herringbone for sure!",

After we addressed our concerns with the hostess, we were seated at a small table that was meant for 4. Not only were we seated at a small table, but it was all the way in the back and our heater wasn't even on. When we again addressed our concerns. They told us that only people who have reservations can be seated at a proper table, we definitely had a reservation. I hate to say this was a race issue but it definitely felt that way. The cost of the brunch is too expensive to not be treated with respect and be valued as customers.",

We started with a bit of a bummer when they were out of the brunch cocktail we wanted to try.  Our reservation was Saturday at 10 am so a bit surprising they didn't have one of the only 2 or 3 cocktails they offered.  Things picked up from there when we ordered the Bacon and Egg Ravioli.  It was amazing.  It is a must order.  So delicious.  For our mains, I ordered the Crab Popper Benny and my companion ordered the California Burrito.  My friend enjoyed her burrito.  The crab poppers and hollandaise on mine were perfect, but my egg was way too under cooked for me.  I need my whites to be somewhat cooked.  These were not.  Service was excellent throughout the meal.  I'm looking forward to coming back to try their new all you can brunch.",

A friend of mine recommended Herringbone and set me up with the groups director. Herringbone did a terrific job sending me emails promptly to accommodate us very last minute to dine with them. When we got there we sat on the outdoor patio. It was beautiful!! All our tables were set up and our pre selected menu's as well. The food was exceptional and came out at the perfect time.

All very delicious and made my day a whole lot better.

I am super selective with my food and with service so the bestowing of 5 stars is certainly indicative of \"high praise\". This is my new boo go-to spot. The front of the restaurant is not where the action is for me, but certainly is cool to walk through. Hidden off the right shoulder of the inner sanctum of Herribone's is THE PATIO. And I call it THE PATIO because it carries its own. The patio is where perfect date night conversation, romantic interludes of sweet nothings, or a secret hideaway with your new Vegas love can line up with the stars. This too is where my evening of wonderment began.   The atmosphere was already set when we walked through the door for sure as it is the perfect setting for after work cocktails or dinner with colleagues.  BUT being taken to THE PATIO was like stubbling upon a secret garden. From the outside, you would never know it was there. Service was hitting on all cylinders from the Hostess to the various Servers who appeared at our beck and call. Yep, I'm feeling kinda important in this place and I like it!  We tried a variety of appetizers of which the tuna salad baguette was my absolute fave! I kept ordering them until my companion finally snatched the last one off the plate....... suggesting that I slowly walk away. No kidding and all jokes aside, this was the best tuna salad EVER! It was made from fresh tuna and complementing ingredients. The fresh lemon flavor set it off quite nicely.  As for the main courses, the Salmon perfectly cooked (moist) and was served with asparagus. The chicken was served with pan drippings and was nicely done as they serve Mary's free range chicken.....a sure sign that quality lives all over this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised, but not overly shocked as this was the Aria Hotel.....this food is what you would come to expect from a gem like Aria.  The service made the evening just perfect! Nothing was off and everything was fabulous. The attentiveness of our Server (s), the atmosphere, the food....what more could one ask for in a city of many choices like Vegas?? Sometimes business and personal travel dining can be hit and miss, but this one goes on the list of best places to dine in Vegas. And this is from someone who eats out often. I was very pleased and will return soon (perhaps for brunch) for certain. I was so IMPRESSED that I plan to review the restaurant in an upcoming issue of the magazine I publish as well. Great job to all the management and staff.....BIG THANKS for a fantastic experience and evening!!",

    "text": "Fantastic way to enjoy a lazy Sunday brunch. There is both indoor and outdoor seating on the patio. The restaurant was not over packed and felt very comfortable. There were no crazy lines rushing to grab all the seafood that comes out, unlike other buffet experiences. You definitely need to be a seafood lover to truly appreciate the selection of cocktail shrimp, lobster tails, fresh oysters, and poke.   The selection also changes throughout a meal - I saw different sushi rolls offered each time. The carvery section rotates with different meats ranging from prime rib to lamb chops, to sausage links. I thought it was a great idea for freshness that you can also order off a menu for items such as grits, tacos, waffles, and avocado toast. We ordered a few items and shared as a table. Great dessert spread - favorites were the chocolate covered strawberries and cannolis. Would definitely return.",

My mom and I have been trying to plan a lunch date for a while here and finally time permitted. I went online to see if the reservations through opentable were available and they were so... SCORE!   With it being a Friday afternoon during the lunch time hour I figured it would be quite busy and sure enough it was! Pays to be proactive and make reservations in advance! Trust me I've learned the hard way about that... When we arrived there were a few lovely hostesses who greeted my mom and I right away. Reservation was confirmed and we were seated within minutes! Once our server Alex came over, we were able to ask a few questions on the lunch menu. He threw in a few recommendations and they were spot on! The \"Lunch Box\" item appeared to be the best bang for you buck. For $34 per person you can choose a salad and an lunch size entree. Our selections were:  Classic Caesar Salad (btw features anchovies mom hated it) Tomato & Avocado Salad  Appetizer:  Local Ceviche-Aguachile, Jalapeno, Avocado, Red Onion, Cilantro, Blue Corn Tortilla Chips. (5/5)  Lunch Entrees: Grilled Chicken Sandwich (5/5) La Jolla Fish Tacos (5/5)  To-Go: Lobster Roll (4/5) Turkey BLT (5/5)  Overall the visit was amazing and I couldn't be more happy with the experience. The customer service was top notch and my mom and I really appreciated the warm welcome! Now I surely will put in the effort to come back for brunch and possibly dinner.. Can't wait !",

Starting with the server, who was a fun dude. As a vacillated on whether to get house water or bottled water, he offered to bring both, with the bottled water pre-poured in a glass so I could do a taste test. I succeeded. Ok, the food. Good stuff. What was most memorable (maybe because last) was the cacao pod dessert. I'm sure others have uploaded pictures, but it was awesome, at least if you like pure chocolate heaven. I also liked the poke on salted chips.",

The wait staff always has great knowledge on the dishes and has great suggestions.  The kitchen gets your food out timely and the attitudes and smiles have all been positive.  Herringbone cuisine:  After a number of dinner visits, these are my current faves.  The Tuna Poke is a must order every time.  The scallops are very tasty and prepped perfectly for maximum flavor.  The mussels is also something I'd recommend.  The Brussels and Pecans is savory and makes me feel healthy af.  The Duck Fat fries is flavorful and does not make me feel healthy af, but it's all worth it.  Herringbone ambiance:  Whether you sit indoors or out, you have a very spacious dining area with a high end feel.  Inside the main bar is showcased and carries all the top shelf booze.  Dark wood tables and chairs provide plenty of dining space.  Outside, there's plenty of shading and heaters to keep the dining experience comfortable in any weather.  Herringbone is one of the $$$ joints on the Strip that provides the value you'd expect for the price.  My friends rave about the brunch experience but I haven't tried it yet.  That's happening soon, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

I loaded my plate with prime rib, thick juicy bacon from the finest pig, salmon, capers and horseradish that will have you in tears. We order the Duck Fat fries that tasted as if they had been cooked in gold and the Orange Ricotta Chocolate Chip Pancakes that were just Sinfully decadent.  Fresh watermelon juice, fresh berries, a light and airy omelet station, the just perfect A/C level... I could go on....  The food combined with the bumping soundtrack along with the superlative service of a beautiful and attentive staff make this a go to Sunday buffet",

The farmers market toast was also just okay.   In hindsight, we should've sent the tacos back because they were terrible.

There was interesting steak, French, Italian and seafood all within yards of one another. The hostess at Herringbone lured me with the mention of a seafood risotto on special that night.  I sat at the bar, and had excellent oysters, and the risotto. Tim, Randy and Robert took excellent care of me, and answered lots of questions about wine, the oyster provenance, and were in general just extremely hospitable and warm.  The fish was perfect at every step. The ginger-scallion ponzu that came alongside the oysters was to die for, and so was the generous amount of seafood in the risotto. Clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops... it was almost more like a seafood stew tbh.   Looking forward to my next visit!",

Management is very upfront and friendly. Danny, Douglas and Ceferin are all very wonderful people. They take care of everything in the restaurant and are very hands on and humble people. They listen to any feedback to make this place the upper echelon of restaurants found in Las Vegas.   This place is also open for lunch and has an excellent menu for happy hour as well, and brunch as well. Bottomless mimosas and bellini's are very tasteful.   The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They know all of their spirits and beers very well and do a great job with pairings and recommendations.  Drinks come out in a timely manor and food is there before you know it.  Bartenders Evan and Randy are really great people to get to know and do a great job. The barback Rob also works very hard and is very kind. Highly recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know them.

    "text": "Best. Brunch. Buffet. Of. My. Life.   Literally.   And that's saying something...I've had my fair share of brunch buffets. So often, buffets try to compensate for quality with quantity. Not so at Herringbone!  They offer the brunch buffet on Saturdays and Sundays. It's a hybrid where there are several buffet stations and then you can also order small plates (which weren't all that small) from a menu.   I spent most of my calories at the seafood station, which had chilled crab legs, lobster tail, oysters, shrimp, tuna poke, and ceviche loaded with avocado (ask for a side of chips) with a few different sauce options.   There was a carving station with a variety of meats--my favorite was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, which was a special. In a totally genius move, they served smoked salmon with bagel chips instead of bagels (all the flavor, less filler) and the cream cheese had salmon and herbs in it--so good.   Omelet bar looked great, but I wasn't about to waste precious stomach space on eggs.   Pre-prepared waffles and a variety of toppings (fresh berries, syrup, etc.) looked good, but I skipped them because I'm a total snob about pancake syrup...I'll only eat actual maple syrup.   I absolutely loved the veggie/salad station, which had 5-6 different prepared options, all of which were excellent. The Caesar salad was amazing. I loved having some produce to offset the vast amounts of seafood and pastries I was consuming.   The small plates we ordered were all excellent, with the exception of one. The loco moco benny was delicious, french fries (that aioli--yum yum) were great, sliders were ultra flavorful, but the absolute star was the wings. Best wings I've ever eaten. Perfectly crisp and complemented with a fantastic sweet and spicy sauce. I could eat those all day long. Next time I'll definitely skip the pancakes (orange ricotta chocolate chip). They weren't bad, but totally not worth it. They were just plain pancakes with a sprinkling of toppings. Worst part was that, despite being described as coming with \"tree sap\" (hip speak for maple syrup, I guess?), they were served with fake syrup. Deal breaker.   I opted to add the $35 unlimited prosecco package (it wasn't advertised but it was La Marca) and they kept a steady supply of bellinis in front of me. They also have the option to do Veuve Clicquot (more) or Moet (even more)--each package includes mimosas, bellinis, prosecco/Champagne, and/or bloody marys.   So often a decent brunch buffet falls apart at dessert--the focus is more on treats that look beautiful instead of taste good. Every single pastry we tried was great. I especially loved the chocolate dipped strawberries (hard to mess up, but nice they offer them as an option).   At $59 a person, this buffet is more than worth it!",

    "text": "OFFICIALLY THE ULTIMATE BRUNCH SPOT! An interactive chef-driven weekend brunch experience, it is $59.00 per person for all-you-can-eat from 10:00AM to 3:00PM!  DRINK: What I think makes this place top notch is also their drinking menu! They also have an awesome bottomless drinking menu for bellinis, mimosas and bloody marys: 1.) ENDLESS PROSECCO ($35.00) 2.) ENDLESS PREMIUM VEUVE CLICQUOT BRUT ($65.00) 3.) ENDLESS MOET & ROSE ($95.00) Not about that bottomless life? They also have delicious cocktails for $17.00 each: - JUST ABOUT PEARFECT (grey goose vodka, asian pear puree, spiced pear, simple syrup, lemon) *highly recommend! - CINNAMON SPICED ORANGE (grey goose vodka, cinnamon, red bull orange) - TOM COLLINS (bombay gin, lemon, simple syrup, club soda) - HEMINGWAY DAIQUIRI (bacardi rum, maraschino, grapefruit, lime, simple syrup)  FOOD:  The buffet part of the brunch is a variation of fresh delicious seafood (lobster, crab legs, jumbo cocktail prawns, different types of poke, etc.), delectable carved meats (prime rib, duck, etc), assortments of fruits / salads, & an impressive sweet station with desserts galore! On top of that, they also have a hot kitchen menu (you can order from as much as you want too!).  KITCHEN MENU: - Orange ricotta chocolate chip pancakes - Chilaquiles - Bobby's kobe beef sliders  - La jolla fish tacos (beer battered or grilled) - Farm egg al forno style  - Loco moco benny (I didn't really like this honestly) - Wings - Boardwalk fries   I honestly was a little hesitant about this place at first, because it seemed a little expensive compared to the other places my friends and I have done brunch at... but wow. WORTH. EVERY. PENNY. All of the food is just packed with quality and flavor, the drinks were delicious -- and the service was absolutely top notch. We sat in the patio and it was just the perfect ambiance with the DJ playing live music! I would compare this visit to every future brunch -- and I can't wait to go back! =)",

On the serve yourself buffet, I really enjoyed the lobster (each tail was cut into 4ths), huge shrimp cocktail, octopus poke, tuna poke and smoked salmon. I also sampled some of the salads which were nice and light.   Additional options on the buffet included a craving station with prime rib and sausage and made to order omelets. They also had a huge dessert table.  I did order a few made to order plates and my favorites were the slider, very juicy, and the orange choc chip pancakes. The pancakes were a perfect \"dessert\" to my meal.  The service I received here was up to par with the price tag. Everyone was very attentive. My waitress paid attention and was ready to offer me another prosecco when I was close to done with my current. The busser would quickly remove plates and fix my napkins as I got up for another round. The buffet items seemed to always be replaced before they ran out.",

On the most recent episode of \"Maybe Herringbone\"  SERVICE  Uneven yet accommodating. They accommodated a special request to make a salad into a sandwich. Even through end result was questionable, the effort is appreciated. They also gave a free dessert for the off-peak lunch order taking almost an hour to come out. Hostesses and roaming managers always super engaging and friendly.   FOOD Tomato/Avo Salad: craving some texture, so asked to put on a wrap or sandwich if possible. What I got was half a salad on a butter toasted hamburger bun. I mean, OK, I asked for something done off menu but also said is fine if chef can't do it or thinks a bad idea. Paying $20 for an entree salad which amounted to a side salad on a bun was not particularly inspiring. Food was decent, just an awkward interaction all around.   Dining companion had the lunch box with tomato/avo salad and lobster roll. He was a big fan.   VERDICT  I keep saying I will venture afield for a decent patio experience, but I always get sucked in by the convenience and great patio. I'll probably be back.",

The first thing that struck me was the fact that the waitresses were all wearing high heels.  Now, I love my heels, but I found that a bit bizarre for a restaurant.  But, that was merely an observation and I never observed a problem with any of the waitresses walking in them.  My husband ordered oysters and calamari and I a chopped beet salad.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the oysters.  The beet salad was very fresh and tasted great.  The calamari was also very good, but I missed a dipping sauce (none was served or offered).  We then ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (him) and the ahi tuna burger (me).  We were very satisfied with both.  Of course, neither of us could finish our food as we over-ordered!  My only complaint would be how close we were sitting next to other tables.  It was difficult to carry on a conversation without being distracted by the people seated around you.  The service was a bit slow for lunch, but we weren't in a hurry, so it was not bothersome for us.  I would definitely return.",

But hey, it's Vegas. I assumed it's just part of the image the restaurant wanted to create. Our server was nice & polite and went over the recommendations. We decided to split the seafood spaghetti, the grilled baby octopus and the onion soup. Do not order the seafood spaghetti....the lobster was no where to be found, the shrimp was over cooked and it was definitely not worth $45! For that price for a pasta dish, I would expect a lot more content! The crab meat barely existed as well. The onion soup was just like any other onion soup....no cheese covering the top but simply only a small baguette with some cheese sprinkled on the bread that was swimming in the soup. There were also tiny raviolis in the soup...wasn't really anything amazing. $14 for the soup. The octopus was probably the best dish. It was nicely charred which I liked. But is it worth $18? Probably not. Since we didn't try any of the raw items, maybe that is what they are known for. Vegas has too many good restaurants to choose from and I don't think I'll be going back. Kudos for the hostess since she was very courteous to us and although we were a bit early for our reservation, she worked it out for us!",

Sofa seating is terrific for cocktails and apps, but a little awkward for full meals. The patio space is absolute perfection, and my favorite outdoor dining space in Las Vegas. Austin is by far, one of the better waiters on The Strip. He orchestrates table service perfectly and knows the menu, wine and cocktail list well. Chef Geno Bernardo is at the top of his game, and everything is fantastic. We usually start with a shellfish platter (try the kimchee meuniere sauce), fresh fish crudo, and salads. The sea bass ceviche was the best I've ever had! Of the hot apps, I'm a fan of the octopus, calamari and meatballs. Geno's meatballs and toast is probably my favorite plate. I could make a meal of it daily! I have a tough time getting to the entrees. I skip straight to the desserts. Don't miss the sundae, carrot cake and cookies & milk. Oh, and the pannacotta...

Asked a busboy for another menu so we could order the wine we were contemplating. The foot we ordered was average, not bad, but not great. The wine was great though.

This wasn't the best idea since the food is now at coffee table height and you have to bend over to eat it-I'm fat so it's like folding over a bowling ball to get to eat.  Service was pretty bad: we were seated for 20 minutes or so and it became obvious that our waiter had forgotten about us.  The manager stopped by and asked us if we needed anything.  We told him we would like to order and he said that he didn't have paper or pen but would try to remember our orders instead.  He did an ok job at that but I ordered a cappuccino and he said 'so latte right?\" And I said \"no cappuccino\" and thought 'uh oh'. Our waiter came by after the manager berated him (we saw them) and he came to apologize about how he dropped the ball.  And then he was like \"you got a latte coming right?\" Me: \"no cappuccino\". And in the end they still brought me a latte.  I was too tired to make a scene about it due to lack of food at this point.  First course came out and then a reaaaaally long pause before our other food did.  Our meal was like 1.5 hours for lunch.  Most of it being waiting to order, and waiting for other food.    Food was meh.  We got: Salmon rillette: was served with this lemon custard that was too sweet and not enough brightness.  Also only 4 pieces of tiny bread for a giant pot of salmon, that doesn't seem right.  Ahi poke: too salty, not flavorful/sweet enough.  I grew up in Hawaii and this wasn't even as good as the poke we got in Costco.  The green onion pancakes served with them were gummy and not crispy enough to balance out the texture.    Niscoise salad: Wasn't that memorable which is why I can't remember anything about it.  Crab cake poppers:  also meh.  Just not as flavorful as the description made us anticipate?   Then we got our checks and ours had a line item that just said \"food\" for $23, in addition to everything else so I don't even know what that was for.  So we just paid and left.  Very expensive, nothing was delicious, terrible service.",

They kept getting my special requests wrong, but made corrections quickly and with a smile. The food tasted great. Odd that the tuna burger comes with two potato sides, but they were both very good (French fries and kimchi potato salad). I went because they have the outside patio and it's quieter than a lot of places on the strip. For parties of 1, the only options offered were the relaxed sofa seating (very spacious) or a seat at the bar - not a traditional table height option, even with a reservation.",

I had White Sea Bass for dinner, friends had Ora king Salmon & seafood speghetti. they all enjoyed what they order. the seafood speghetti is big plate. you can actually share if you plan to have a few appetizers. we also had brussel & pecan, which wonderful. my husband doesnt care for brussel sprout, surprisingly he enjoy this dish. i highly recommend this place.",

The side of Roasted Cauliflower Steak was delicious. They tasted like buttery vinaigrette with capers.  The Fisherman's Stew looked appetizing with a lot of colors and fresh seafood but I was not fond of the taste of the stew itself.   DH ordered the Whole Grilled Branzino. It had a nice crunch on the outside but the fish itself did not have much flavor even after applying the grilled lemon and chili sauce.   The service, atmosphere, and presentation of the food were all very good.   The taste of the foods we ordered, though, was hit or miss with the miss being farther from the target considering the prices. Perhaps if we ordered other entrees we would have had a better experience.",

Maybe keep a few for cocktail hours but to spend 800$ hunched over, not happening.  We had drinks and they wer all great. The one that is made with bacon was greater than all, it had bacon.  Our waiter, Ciprianni, knows the menu backwards and forwards.  He was great at describing and explaining.  The sailboat appetizer was off the chart. Too bad I had to share with others.   Main courses were well received.  My only issue was the seafood spaghetti I had was lacking in over all seafood. At that price, I would have kicked more, not just 3 shrimp and some rings of squid. Other than that the patio is where you should eat.  Make a reservation and get in.",

The calamari has a nice flavor sauce type drizzle, again my only put off was the chewing parts that could've been fried a little longer.   We had reservations here after our Red Carpet and from approaching the restaurant and checking in we were all smiles as the hostess was super nice and sat us promptly while pulling out my chair and placing my napkin on my lap and then going around to do the same for my husband who didn't allow it as he's a man and much prefer pulling out a woman chair than having one pull out his chair. However the hostess placed the napkin on his lap and provided us both a menu for food and a shared wine and spirits menu.  We were entertained by a LIVE DJ who was spinning a mixture of 90's R&B and Top 40's I mean I couldn't stay still in my chair last night.  We started with some crab puffs, calamari and Kale and strawberry salad. I explained be calamari earlier. The crab puffs and Kale Salad were the starter SHOW STOPPERS. They were soooo good and flavorful. My husband and I shared them both. We went on to share a main course which was scallops and Risotto and when I say it was soooo DELICIOUS I MEAN IT. The flavor was full and we super enjoyed it and if we were younger and had no manners we would've licked the plate LoL.  This place is a must do in Vegas located inside the Aria.",

    "text": "Take-away: Nice highlights but somewhat disappointing overall.   Atmosphere: Quite louder than you'd expect. Everyone was leaning in to talk to each other and nearly shouting around the restaurant..... for brunch. Nice to have a DJ and all but you can still take it down a notch. The decor was nice, open air, well-dressed servers. Lots of good natural light.  Service: There was one server for nearly the whole brunch restaurant and it got busy. She was aided by a few \"second-hand\" mates but it didn't run as smoothly as one would like. A few times we needed to remind about bringing some hot sauce, one beverage, and someones dish.  Food/Drinks: Here's the big ups and downs. Let's start with the highlights. The Chilaquiles were amazing. Spot-on and totally legit. We were pleasantly surprised how authentic they were. The ravioli egg and bacon were also nice, appropriately small, and rich. However... rest was just off. The breakfast burrito was dry and not very flavorful. The pitcher of bloody marks was watery, bland, and needed 1lb of tabasco to make it lively. The other basic dishes people had were just meh. Even the avocado toast was scant on avocado and flavor -- mostly the charred bread came through. Even the polpo courtesy dish was uninspiring.  We likely won't go back with so many other great restaurants for brunch (e.g. Bardot right across the hallway!). It could be a nice spot for dinner when louder music and more of their land and sea spirit might come through.",

The dishes were all incredibly balanced and flavorful, mixed in with great service, and a pretty fresh set in the background by DJ Guy Williams.  There are a lot of restaurants here on the strip but it feels like most of them are trying too hard and fall short.  We started with some cocktails; Better Mules & Gardens, Kiss My Bubbles, and Stone Blossoms.  Amazing.  Starters included oysters (Kumamoto and Miyagi), Lobster Hearts and Palm salad, Buffalo Octopus, and Wings.  We then shared a Whole Grilled Branzino and 32 oz Tomahawk steak paired with the Roasted Mushrooms and Duck Fat Fries.  Coffee and Chocalate, Sea Salt and Caramel for dessert.  This fed 5 people.

I wanted something to eat and yo not have to go too far...hence, Herringbone.   I will say this...dining by yourself is difficult enough....when an establishment opens and there are many vacant tables, don't quibble about where to put someone. Seat them and get them eating and drinking.   That being said, I started with oysters...I reckon that I'm waaaay too East Coast, as I thought the West Coast selection was just eh.   However, I ordered the bacon and egg ravioli, and I'm in love. It was seasoned perfectly, the yolks oozed appropriately, the pancetta was ample and it was sublime.   I highly recommend this dish. Order it often!",

Very friendly host girls let me check out the temperature in the patio after we were seated inside originally cause I was afraid of the heat outside at first. Finally we decided to sit at the beautiful patio cause it wasn't warm at all surprisingly. The patio lounge area was so relaxing and comfy.   Lunch menu was so good with great items. We started off with two large San Pellegrino cause both hubby and I were severely dehydrated from excessive drinking the entire weekend. I had a specialty cocktail which was pretty and tasty, hubby's Vesper martini was delicious too. Later on I had a Mezcal cocktail and a Corona Michelada, they were all very tasty.  For food we had tomato basil soup and crab cake as apps, they were so fresh and refreshing. For entrees we had fish tacos and lobster roll, they were so yummy as well. We chose seasonal sorbets as dessert cause it was getting warmer and we had been drinking. Our waitress surprised me with assorted mini desserts for my birthday and they were so yummy.   The service was top notch, our waitress was so friendly, attentive and pleasant. I really enjoyed my early birthday lunch here and we will come back here whenever we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Herringbone is one of my favorite places to dine or recommend on the strip, particularly for seafood lovers. Their California coastal menu is packed with great choices that almost necessitate going as a group to try several dishes, but it's also a great date night space. Their gorgeous patio seating is perfect for brunch, too.  DINNER: First visit was for a dinner date. This was a while back and I don't remember specific dishes just that everything was great and we were both impressed. I'm not often a repeat diner at expensive Strip restaurants but from fresh oysters to dessert, everything was solid and I made a mental note to return.  LUNCH: Returned for restaurant week with Bethany E, shared the lobster roll and the burrata chicken sandwich (both just as good as they sound) with apps and dessert. Everything was SO good and a great value for the RW pricing, not to mention giving back to the local community. Portions are shareable, and the seafood in particular is a highlight. The desserts that were featured were gorgeous and unique, including a cheesecake topped with sorbet- doesn't seem like it would work but it was beautiful and delicious!  BRUNCH: Most recent visit was last weekend for brunch with a group of gals. Pricing is a bit high at $60/pp, beverages extra, but you get access to a buffet of salad, charcuterie, carving, seafood, and dessert stations, along with a menu of small plates from the kitchen that are included. Standouts from the buffet included the giant, plump cocktail shrimp and plentiful lobster tails (no butter though), smoothie station, mini poke bowls (so cute!), and crab legs, while the shrimp & grits, avocado toast (on rye!), salmon benedict, and fish tacos (cod) were all well-portioned, fresh, and flavorful. We didn't have room for the sliders, wings, or french toast that are praised in other reviews. It's a pricey morning, so maybe best for a celebration, but something I'd be open to going to again.  Herringbone is one of those places that performs so well, so consistently, that I would always be down for a return visit and recommend it without hesitation. Prices might be a bit high for regular dining but the quality has not disappointed and service has always been attentive and friendly. It's only a matter of time before I go back again myself.",

    "text": "I CANNOT say enough great things about Herringbone! Our dining experience was  phenomenal!   When you go in there is an a la carte option or their brunch special which is a buffet and it's $59.  We chose the a la carte option, had the avocado toast, herringbone fish tacos and beef sliders accompanied by the Parmesan truffle fries which was heavenly! The avocado toast is probably one of the best I've had, the rye bread with the pesto and ingredients was just the perfect combination! The beef sliders was juicy, flavorful, and the bun was toasted splendidly!  I will say that I was not impressed with tacos, although it was good, it could've used more flavor and was a little dry in my opinion.   As far as drinks, my favorite is definitely the strawberry Bellini and please please please do yourself a favor and do not get the same ole boring mimosa, get the watermelon mimosa! It's the most refreshing drink to cool off with this summer heat! AH, and the watermelon Moscow mule shots was to die for!   NEXT, can we talk about our excellent service!!???  PETER!! Go see him!  He is the BEST! He is accommodating, charismatic and KNOWS customer service to say the least! Herringbone is so incredibly lucky to have him! He surpasses in the leading service industry!  Thank you Peter, you made our Vegas dining experience a memorable one!",

Honestly I can't think of anything wrong with my dining experience here.  To start off, service was impeccable.  Kristin was the absolute dream staff member of Herringbone.  Combined with the table assistants, she was attentive with a cherry on top.  A huge thank you to Kristin!  My foodie friend and I were able to share a few things from the restaurant week menu.  For one, the lobster roll was fantastic.  The lightly toasted bread held the fresh lobster, light lemon and creme fraiche.  The flavor was immediately bursting.  Not to go unmentioned was the grilled chicken sandwich.   The stacked chicken breast, burrata, heirloom tomato, onion and aioli created mouthwatering sandwich.   I would order either of these two again.    What would a meal be without dessert?  The mascarpone cheesecake had sorbet on top.  It was a light fruity treat that is perfect for a summer day.  It was a first for me to have my cheesecake presented this way.  Different and delightful.    Aria has some great dining options.  Herringbone is one you won't want to miss.",

Bacon on the buffet was undercooked as I like crispy bacon and this was not even close.   As with lost restaurants in Vegas, the music was way too loud for my liking. It is expensive...$69 for the brunch. It would be more worth $45 in my opinion. We tried the sliders off the tasting menu and they were excellent.

When we arrived we were told to check in and wait at the bar as they were not seating anyone yet. Even though they were supposed to be open by then.  It was very odd. We were finally seated a bit after 10:35  There is a buffet concept with items from the kitchen per the menu. Each of the stations were fashioned throughout the restaurant area.   Today I got the avacado toast, French toast, and sampled a bit of their seafood and pastries. Plus hot tea. The food was very good and the seafood fresh.   They were out of honey, so our beverage server went downstairs for me and brought honey. He was truly the MVP of my morning.   The interior is very modern, they have an outdoor bar area as well. I enjoyed the concept of couches, booths, tables, and bar seating. Very neat.   Location is Aria casino- Las Vegas Blvd-/ Tropicana - ample parking, garage or valet",

I know that things in Las Vegas can be a little pricier but I have been to a different Herringbone and I think it was a little cheaper.  Our server was great and sitting on the outdoor patio was really nice (considering it wasn't too hot when we were here).  I had a caesar salad ($18) and added chicken and it was $12 additional for the chicken! My $30 salad was kind of small so I guess, I recommend you get something else unless you really want salad!

I knew of this restaurant, but with so many here in Vegas, this was just another one that I had not been to yet. It is located up the escalator with a few other restaurants. The staff at the host stand were very courteous and warm. We were seated right away. Our server was Oscar(he was fantastic and made recommendations for both food and wine).  Before the food arrived, we received an amuse-bouche of cold beet soup. My husband did not care for it *picky eater :( *, but I thought it was delicious. For wine we got a bottle of German Riesling( Riesling Kabinett, St. Urbans-Hof 'Ockfener Bockstein', Mosel). It was great!.  Branzino: this was hands down, the best branzino I have ever had. See the picture for how it is presented, but every bite of it was perfectly seasoned and just oh so perfect.The fennel salad was so good and the salsa verde added a nice touch to the fish.  Halibut: I have to say, this was also probably some of the best halibut I have had. It was charred just right and it just flaked apart so delicately.   Lobster fried rice: Mmm, it as so good! It is served with a fried egg on top(neat, right?), and even though the pieces of lobster was small cuts, it tasted very, very good.",

I was in Vegas for the weekend staying at Aria, and my fiance and I were looking for a cute, yet somewhere that has great food and we stumbled upon Herringbone. Right off the bat customer service was welcoming and very attentive.  The patio setting was beautifully assembled. And the food was delicious!  I will definitely come back to Herringbone, when in Vegas!",

    "text": "In a city with no shortage of \"destination\" Restaurants it is assured that some will go overlooked, and with both Jean Georges Steakhouse as well as BARDOT Brasserie occupying Aria's second floor Herringbone has had to endure the struggle since opening, though those who've had the opportunity to dine there almost universally sing its praises.   Originally created by Brian Malarkey in late-2015, a hasty transfer to Hakkasan Group shortly thereafter making the \"Land. Meats. Sea.\" concept an outlier inside a property owned by MGM Resorts International, it was recently announced that at the end of May Herringbone will be brought under control of the company, and with a new Spring menu recently launched now is as good a time as ever to visit.    Then and now one of Las Vegas' most breezy environments, a dining room that continues outside rarely loud despite half of its walls being fabric, it is from a hostess stand that guests are led to the space toqued by Chef Marty Red DeLeon Lopez and colleague Nyko Christian, a focus on Ingredient quality including some of the region's top farms and fisherman always guaranteeing something fresh while Marty's Filipino heritage frequently emerges to build flavor profiles The Strip has rarely seen.  Anchored by great service led by Ceferin Oliva and Doug Solomon, two sharp-dressed men overseeing a staff that has seen less turnover than most, it is with sports playing on television and music overhead that guests are invited to select items from six sections, the \"Salt & Brine Raw Bar\" popular for good reason though this meal instead got started with a combination of Cocktails plus \"Greens\" and \"Cold Fare.\"  Focusing on seasonal plates, Chef Lopez's Tiradito on this occasion offering Amberjack bathed in Citrus and Peppers with added brightness from blossoming Herbs, it was alongside this that locally-grown Vegetables from Desert Bloom Eco Farm shined amidst Hummus, imported Prosciutto served in two textures atop compressed Melon and Burrata also impressive though Herringbone's recently changed Lobster & Hearts of Palm Salad managed to wrestle away the spotlight thanks to its base of pureed Salsify Root with savory qualities that play well off sweet Meat and Grapefruit.  Onward to \"Hot Fare,\" sliced Pork Belly painted by Black Garlic Adobo plus fried Shrimp along with their edible Shells and vibrant Dipping Sauce both examples of Marty's ability to showcase ingredients amidst bold flavors, it may come as a surprise to some that Herringbone's best dish this season is a riff on \"Hot Chicken\" with Asian inklings, the half-Bird from Mary's Organic first brined 72-hours before being rolled in Oil with mixed Chilis and emerging crispy yet light alongside Pickles made on-site that go well beyond Dill.   Treating Soft Shell Crab to the same Rice Flour coating as Chicken, the results near-equal as Flesh and Carapace are carefully matched to Pomegranate Arils plus seasonal Vegetables, those favoring Red Meat will be happy to know that Steaks are offered in three sizes, though for the more adventurous Cattle is better tasted as Beef Carpaccio steered East by Fish Sauce or a reprise from Marty's past in the form of Smoked Bone Marrow topped in shredded Short Rib and pickled Chilis.  Sated and bordering on stuffed, portions more than justifying Strip-pricing when sourcing is considered, round four included three Fish each taken out of their usual context, Branzino wrapped in Banana Leaves to concentrate flavors built upon by Panang Curry while meaty Chilean Seabass finds levity in Dashi, though neither managed to match the creativity or impact of Monk Fish \"Osso Bucco\" built by Prosciutto-wrapped filets swimming in the flavors of Puttanesca.  Not the sort of table to skip something sweet, though Herringbone's Dessert offerings have not changed in ages, it is fortunate that both Mascarpone Cheesecake and the Chocolate Tart are small, and much like the rest of Herringbone's Cuisine the flavors are impactful with Ingredients well thought out such that each compliments the others.  FIVE STARS:  Although Herringbone has been an under-appreciated property ever since opening, the food has never been in question. Now, changing hands from Hakkasan to MGM at the end of May, one can only hope Aria management will put a little more PR behind the best Seafood restaurant in town. Always big on flavor, never lacking in ingredient quality and more creative by the day, Marty and Nyko's new Spring Menu is nothing short of stunning.",

It took forever to get drinks, the server told us we could not order appetizers before dinner or it would take too long, and there was confusion about if they had certain menu items available. The food tasted OK but much of the food was not served warm enough. For the price of the meal we could have gone to Catch downstairs or another restaurant and would have had an exceptional dinner.",

    "text": "Had brunch at Herringbone with friends, they offer a buffet and also options to order from menu included in the buffet price.  AYC \"drink\" option!   The place is located inside Aria Hotel, and this restaurant goes perfect with the vibe. I love the patio area, pretty descent size, if the weather allows it, I would recommend to eat outside.   Staff is polite and friendly, always taking time to check on us.   I enjoyed the buffet they have good options from made to order omelettes to fresh seafood. Please take a look at the dessert table so many sweet treats to enjoy.   We also ordered from the menu ( I think all of it lol) I liked the avocado toast simple but delicious and the french toast.   About the food I think is good, wouldn't say my favorite brunch in town, but I would say one of my favorite... I WOULD recommend this spot to anyone visiting town.  Thank you so much to the team for a great time!!   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SPANISH VERSION Visite este lugar para brunch con amistades, cuentan con buffet y tambien menu a la carta que entra en el precio del buffet. Tambien paquetes de bebidas para empezar la fiesta!   Este lugar localizado dentro del Hotel Aria (uno de mis favoritos), y este lugar va perfecto con el ambiente. Me encanto el area de Patio, un area de buen tamano, y si el clima lo permite te recomiendo comer afuera.   Los empleados educados y al pendiente de que todo estuviera bien todo el tiempo.  Disfrute del buffet cuentan desde Omelettes hechos a la orden hasta frescas opciones de mariscos. Pero por favor tambien hagan una parada en la mesa de postres, riquisimas opciones para disfrutar.   Tambien pedimos casi todo el menu si no es que todo de la carta, lo que yo recomendaria seria el pan tostado con aguacate y el pan frances.   De la comida opino que esta bien, no diria que es mi lugar favorito pero si entrara en uno de los favoritos, y claro que lo recomendaria para cualquier persona que visite Las Vegas.   Muchas gracias al equipo por el excelente rato!",

There is a menu that is included with the price. He also ordered the bottomless Veuve Clicquot champagne and I just had one drink as I was driving.  The brunch buffet was overflowing with Lobster, Crab Legs, Shrimp, sushi and a carving station with meats and sandwiches. Plenty of deserts, salad selection etc. Off the menu we had the fish tacos(bland), chicken wings(awesome) and the duck fat fries(tasty and flavorful).  Seriously so damn good.  The waitress came by often to fill his champagne and our bucket of Perrier. She also brought over a bowl of lobster with warm butter without us ever asking. So nice   Super impressed by the service and food.  Brunch done right in Las Vegas. Thank you!",

We finally got his attention and received  our drinks and asked him his favorite menu items. His suggestions were the Barratta, tuna poki and yellowfin which were delicious.  The manager Gino and Candice came over and checked in the both of us and asked how service was and we told him about our experience so far. Ryan told us \" the best part of the evening is that our drinks were free\" ( assuming it had to do with the lackadaisical service from earlier.) Everything tasted great but our final dish, It was the Grilled octopus.  It was softly grilled and a bit on the salty side. Our bill came and the drinks were included minus the grilled octopus.

    "text": "First of all, this is a review of the bar and not the restaurant itself.  My friends and I were staying at the Aria and two of us decided to have a drink at the Herringbone which is inside the Aria.  We ordered two drinks and no food.  The drinks were expensive ($16 each) but they were artisan cocktails so it was fine.  They weren't life-changing but they were good.  I left a 2$ tip per cocktail so the total bill (with tax) came to $38.61.  I still have a copy of that bill that I signed.  Upon checking my bank statement, however, I came to find that I was charged $49.74.  Then the real fun begins.  I call the Herringbone and ask to speak to the manager.  Placed on hold....20 minutes later no one has answered.  I hang up and try again.  Then I'm told that if I have an issue with my bill I need to go through the Aria (which is really MGM Resorts International).  I  speak to a customer service representative named Bryan (yes I know his last name but I'm not going to post it here) and I am told on 8-22-16 the following: \"I spoke with Christian, a supervisor at the Herringbone. He will contact you once he locates the signed copy of your receipt and does the necessary research.\"  Yeah, that never happened.  I write back to Bryan asking again about this.  He does apologize and takes my cell phone number assuring me that someone will get in touch with me.  That was on 8-25-16.  Have I heard anything back from them?  Big Fat No.    So you know what?  I'm done with this.  To the Herringbone/Aria I say this:  I hope that $11 was worth it to you.  This was my second time staying at the Aria.  There will not be a third.  In addition, the two friends I was traveling with will also not be staying there in the future.    On a side note, if you're staying at the Aria don't even think about opening the little refrigerator in the room.  Let's say you walk past it and bump the door with your leg and it opens?  You've just been charged $25.  ......insert eye roll here.......",

While the Oysters were great, the variety of sauces provided made it special.  We also enjoyed the Grilled Fish Tacos.  For drinks, we tried the Just About Pearfect and the Ballast Point Calico Amber, both of which were outstanding.  The service was very friendly, prompt and professional.  We definitely look forward to returning.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a meal to remember: look no further! This place is amazing. We started off with specialty drinks (they have a spruced up Moscow mule with rhubarb and strawberry deliciousness). We then ordered the \"Dingy\": a size-able platter of fresh crab, shrimp and oysters that comes with six amazing sauces for your delight. We also had the ahi tuna poke and some other sushi appetizer: all of it was tasty. To keep the seafood extravaganza going, I ordered the scallops with butternut squash risotto and balsamic glaze. They were cooked just right and melted in my mouth. My friend ordered the sea bass and got a very nice portion. We finished with a dessert whose name I can't recall but it was similar to cheesecake with a raspberry garnish and chocolate shavings. The presentation on everything was fantastic. Chef Nick and various others came to our table and thanked us for dining with them. Lastly, the service was probably the best I've experienced on the strip. I tend to drink quite a bit of soda water, quickly. I never had to ask for a refill-they were provided before my glass was low enough to notice.   The only thing I didn't like was that there were no salt/pepper shakers. Sounds silly, but I love salt (extra) and was kind of afraid to ask for it-given the fact the chefs cook to perfection, and I just tend to prefer salty. Oh, and then there's the co$t factor: this place is quite extravagant and pricey, to say the least. But definitely worth the splurge if you can afford it!!!",

What is chef Geno thinking, is he trying to make memories, or just make money. The service was 1 star. I understand this is a new restaurant, but with 4.2 million dollars to open they could have worked out the kinks. I appreciate chef working on a Monday, but why, it didn't help anything. He must have been getting his jollies off with the bar crowd. $400 dollar meal with 4/6 entrees, get real! This place needs a wake up call. Your in the Aria, step up or bring in Chef David Burke. I would have rather eaten at bonefish grill.",

    "text": "Herringbone has been on my radar for a long time and I finally got to try it this past weekend for lunch.  I must say that my initial reaction to their menu was shock... it is not quite \"American\" only, which is what makes Herringbone amazing.  As I researched for places to eat, I noticed that Herringbone was marketed as an American seafood restaurant, which to be honest does not sound exciting to me.  But the truth is that this place is a fusion restaurant with dishes from all over the world.  We had the Hamachi, beef tartare with truffle, chilaquiles, ceviche, moco loco, lobster roll, and a few other things that I can't remember right now.  The Hamachi and ceviche were out of this world.  Chilaquiles was beautiful, but taste wise it was ok.  Lobster roll was great.  We inquired about mussels since I had seen those in Yelp but it wasn't on the menu.  The waitress asked the chef if they could do mussels during lunch and he said yes.  However, we decided that we didn't want mussels in the end... so to our surprise, the chef came out with a dish of mussels and said it was on the house since they had already started preparing it before we decided we didn't want mussels.  Chef was super nice and the waitress was as well.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience and the food.  Definitely a place I would try over and over again.",

    "text": "Overrated in my opinion - at least for now.  Maybe they're still working out their kinks but I was unimpressed overall.  Started with the Salmon Rillettes which were really good - served in a jar with toast points and a small ramekin of lemon curd.  The lemon curd was a great touch and paired nicely with the savory Rillettes.  Unfortunately that's really the last positive thing to talk about.  The service at the bar was anemic and subpar when they were actually around - they seemed more interested in cleaning the bar than actually performing service or talking to their guests ... except for one gentleman sitting at the bar who they must've known since he was the only person to have the bartender engage them out of a 4/5 full bar.  They were very unsure of themselves when I asked a routine question about the \"set\" on which the fish were served - it took three of them to come to a conclusion as to what to say when I asked them to tell me about it.  My entree of Sea Bass was minuscule and I'd feel the same way even if I were in a tapas place.  If the fish itself was 5 ounces I'd be surprised, I'd say more like 4-4.5 oz ... for $40 - I know it's the Strip but that's just ridiculous ( to be fair, everything else seemed reasonably priced considering I was in Aria, as did the fish ... before I knew how tiny the portion was for a main dish ).  Fish and veggies were cooked nicely but severely oversalted.  The dish would've been good had the fish not been too salty and there was more of it but the way it stands I didn't feel there was any value there at all - seriously, it was appetizer sized ( and I'm a local ... I know all about how expensive it is to eat on LVB - this dish had me scratching my head as to whether or not 1.)  more was on the way out or   2.) I had been given and charged for a \"smaller portion\" ... but neither were the case ).  Had the Mac & Cheese ( with lobster and apple ) as a side ... skip it.  It had no backbone - the noodles were overcooked, close to mushy, and retained no sign of al dente and the whole side was super bland and lacked any structure.  That's where the salt could've come in handy.  I had hoped with apple involved there would be some sort of crunch but it was nowhere to be found as the apples were also overcooked, lacking as much backbone as the noodles themselves, and had very little to add to the dish ( Maybe the apples aren't supposed to be al dente ... but again, I was thinking that the snap and \"crunch\" of the apple would provide texture and that was the reason it would be included but there was none of that and almost no taste component added either since I had to seek out the bits of apple to make my assertation ).  Not much lobster in there either but I didn't really expect much for $18 - it was most likely slipper lobster and, again, not much of it.  I did like the idea of the pretzel crumb crust on top of the m&c and that was probably the highlight of the dish but that was the sole bright spot.  The ambiance was decent.  The music was just at the right volume, even a hair more would have been too loud - I like my restaurants as restaurants ... not clubs ... and the DJ who was spinning music for the room was doing a pretty good job.  Again, the Salmon Rillettes were very good but $85 + tip for Salmon Rillettes, salty fish, and bland mac & cheese isn't cutting the mustard.  I will try it again in a few months and hopefully things will have turned for the better.",

Really the only reason we decided to venture here was because our booking came with a $100 dining credit- we decided to go with herringbone because our family is a sucker for seafood. I knew going in the portions were going to be small but expensive, so I wasn't surprised to see that when our dishes came out. Overall all of the dishes we ordered were great! We ordered the yellowtail, lobster tortellini, truffle fries, calamari, and seafood spaghetti. Everything was really unique tasting and seasoned perfectly. Surprisingly, when we finished our meal (we shared), we were all quite full/sated. My favorites were the truffle fries, calamari, and seafood spaghetti. We ate outside on the patio which was lovely. The weather was warm but there are plenty of fans and mists. Our server was attentive and friendly. If I ever have the money or receive credit, I will definitely come back here again.",

When our table was ready Chanel, one of the hostesses, escorted us to and helped make us familiar with the menu.  Everything sounded great, so we sampled many of the appetizers, including soup and salad i.e. Beet For entrees we settled on seafood pasta & rack of Lamb...both proved yummy! Chef Geno and staff outdid themselves!  Dessert was an exceptionally light cheesecake and an alcoholic root beer float...how's that for a combination, but it worked!

A perfectly grilled burger with bacon, lettuce, onion marmalade and chipotle aioli. Need I say more? It was a burger unlike any other I had, honestly. Then fro desert, their sundae. By god, marshmallow fluff and chocolate and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. It was delicious and sweet to the bone!

I loved the atmosphere with the chill but upbeat vibe. The outdoor space wasn't open yet but it was beautiful and will likely be the place to be in Vegas. The entire staff was very friendly and attentive. And let me not forget the DJ spinning great tunes or the delicious libations, particularly the Pamplemousse Press. The only thing that could be better is if there was a Herringbone in NYC. I would be a regular. It has been a few weeks since I have been there and I still crave the meal I had.

Service- Our waitress was very nice, she took us through the menu, made suggestions about what to order and even struck up a conversation with us! She definitely made the dinner a good time.  Food- this is where this restaurant unfortunately falls short. I had the baby kale salad which was actually quite good- the vinaigrette was tasty and the salad had a nice mix of flavors. My fiance had the onion soup (not what I would have picked at a seafood place) and it was just okay- not very flavorful and perhaps a little bit too much of a stretch from the classic (they put noodles in it and it didn't have that fatty hunk of melted cheese on top). For dinner we ordered the Sea Bass which was very very bland, the brussels sprouts which were way too sweet, and the death by potatoes which were very delicious. If I were to go back I would have opted for more items from the salt and brine bar or the cold fare.  Overall this place was just okay, not sure if it was worth the expensive bill. However I think I would go back and just try different menu items because the service was great and the restaurant itself was so cool!",

Drink service was quick although waitress seemed a bit overworked. Food was delicious though. The couches are a tad odd and make for eating \"interesting\". Will for certain be back. We had the dinghy seafood platter and burrata salad app followed by two of their desserts and a few glasses of bubbly.",

    "text": "This was highly disappointing. I would normally give this a two star but instead I have to give it a one star due to the value of the meal for the taste was not proportionate. My fiance and I ordered shisito peppers, Brussel sprouts, sashimi (which never came out), yellow fin tuna entree, and the scallops entree. I would rate everything that we did order that actually came out ranging between a 1-4 out of 10. The yellowfin tuna was so flavorless and the scallops were not properly seared on all sides that the center was still raw. We both ended up not wanting to finish our entrees. You would expect for the price of the meal it would at least be above average, not below.",

First, they do try to seat you for dinner at tables that are knee high which is unacceptable for dinner in my opinion.  The cocktail drinks are very sugary.  The food is okay but considering the prices, would even say bad.  The waiter dis not bring out my appetizer and when i got my dinner, i told him and his only response was ... I didnt add it to your bill cause we were out of it.  He failed to mention that when i ordered it.  3 out of 5 guests felt their fish was overcooked. Its a nice place but needs to up the service and food.  I did like the brussel sprouts side.",

We all had the buffet style brunch which was outstanding. There was so much seafood to choose from that it made it well worth the $60. You could even order food directly off the menu and that too was delicious. Our waitress was a gem but she too had the one complaint we had.. the DJ was TOO DAMN LOUD..   I mean I get it, it's Vegas but come on, it's brunch there's no reason for a club . It's time to enjoy and recoup. We asked the manager to turn it down but I guess they have a limit of turning it down. Eventually the DJ left and the music overhead was fine but be warned if you have a headache/hangover or have little tolerance for the club while you eat.. don't go early.. you've been warned :)",

We weren't really hungry so we opted for this place. It was a warm night with a bit of Vegas breeze/wind, so we sat outside. It gave us a nice view of the pool and we were semi shielded from too much wind. There was a good bunch of people out. The music was perfect. The blend of mellow but up beat Vegas.   We only ordered the crab cake, some drinks, and the seafood platter for two (or smaller of the two versions). The crab cake was okay. It wasn't my favorite among the ones we've had. It was citrusy and.. pushed the freshness of the crab out of the food. I didn't enjoy it. My husband says the cake was a three but he wouldn't order it again.   The platter on the other hand, I'd order that again! It was fresh, well worth it and the kitchen did a lot to accommodate the people who are unfamiliar with cracking/de-shelling. The dish came with lobster, shrmip/prawns, oysters and I think that's it? It doesn't sound like much but definitely filled us up and we left happy.   I'd be happy to try this place again. :)",

Herringbone has good ratings, but was 5th on our choice list for seafood.  On a Wed. night, there was no wait, which gave me doubts.  But don't know until you try it! We arrived late for our res.; no prob.  The hostess convinced us to sit outside in the patio at 50 deg. w/ solar heaters (they have misters for hot days, clever!).  Glad we did it!  The patio is beautiful and spacious. The best part is the service.  One gentleman took our orders and another one served.  Both gave full attention.  Even lowered the music volume when asked.  Now the food:  EXCELLENT!  We had the beet salad and the special Filipino tempura salad.  Both were flavorful and artfully prepared.  We ordered the seafood stew,  and loved it.  It was different w/ Israeli couscous and saffron broth.  All the seafood in the salads and stew tasted so fresh. The quality and service are 5 stars!  I would definitely recommend and go back.",

    "text": "Antisocial?  Eat somewhere else.  Imagine lounging around with your closest friends on a cool Cali evening, sipping cocktails and being served fresh and vibrant bites the \"help\".   Now drop that into a Vegas mega resort and you have Herringbone.  Billed as \"social dining\", just think comfy lounge, with sofas and plush seats surrounding low tables forcing conversation.    Before continuing, \"Hey, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone\".  Don't be that douche.  Nothing screams, I don't know how to interact with live humans like bringing out your mobile.  Try it and watch eyes roll.  Summary: great vibe, great ambiance, OK food.  Being honest, in a social setting, the food is not the center of attention.  It just needs to be good enough not to offend.  Solid, not stellar.  That said, it meets expectations.  In general, ingredients are fresh and treated simply.  Flavors are vibrant.  No heavy sauces.  All dishes are meant to be shared.  Think finger foods eaten over a cocktail napkin.    The oyster sampling is fun and the chilled seafood tower OK (perfectly cooked lobster, slightly overcooked shrimp) but those can be had anywhere.  Focus instead on a very good salmon rillettes.  Warm smoked salmon mixed with creme fraiche and clarified butter and chives paired with a tangy lemon curd.  Perfect when spread on the grilled bread.    Not to be out shown, the scallop ceviche.  Sweet, tender scallops in a sesame ponzu sauce with tobiko (flying fish roe).  The earthiness of the sesame and very bright citrusy taste of the yuzu greatly enhances the oceanic sweetness of the scallops.  Lavosh accompanies the dish but dive bombing is the best way to enjoy it.  Finally the poke.  Simple cubes of hamachi, Maui onions, grated ginger, garlic, scallions, and crushed macadamia nuts.  Yuzu, soy, and shichimi pepper rounds out the seasoning.  Great complexity with the oil from the macadamia nuts adding a great nutty flavor.  Very clean finish with just the right amount of spicy heat.  The scallion pancakes make the perfect vehicle to get this into your eagerly awaiting mouth.  Friendly, casual but efficient service.  Interesting selection of craft cocktails and half bottle service.  Well chosen wine list.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.  Note:  This restaurant is very busy.  High level mLife members, make reservations through the mLife site to guarantee seating.  In the end, the pieces are provided, the experience is ultimately what you make of it.",

If The Walking Dead were a restaurant it would be Herringbone, the food was mediocre at best, no passion, no seasoning, just all around carelessness.  This was a Valentine's Day dinner, we ordered the Prix Fixe menu.  I'll post a picture of that menu.  The tastiest part of the meal was the dessert and the Pellegrino water.  Whenever the servers bothered to come to your table the service was good, but you will notice yourself and other patrons trying to flag them down.  Again, they're like zombies here waiting for stimulus.  Our ticket was around $220, if I took the zero off of that amount it would be worth it.  Why bother to open multimillion dollar restaurant without the passion necessary run it?  Waste of time and money.",

    "text": "Three of us met for lunch at Brian Malarkey's new restaurant Herringbone in the Aria Hotel on the second floor across from the escalators/stairs from the casino.  Geno Bernardo is the executive chef of this newly opened restaurant.  We were seated at one of their lounge style chairs and table.  The patio was not yet opened because of the cold weather.  Having lunch that lasted about 3 hours, it got a little tiresome for me leaning forward and reaching down to get food from the coffee table.  I can see for a dinner or some drinks and a little food, this would be fine.    Chef Bernardo brought out/sent out several seafood dishes to start the lunch.  After an auspicious start with crostini topped with uni, sea salt, and lardo, we were brought three kinds of oysters and then an oyster shooter. I was impressed by the chef's relating how quickly the oysters were gotten to the restaurant.  The Naked Cowboy shooter with crab and caviar was especially good with the salt of the caviar adding to the flavor of the oyster.  After this, several seafood dishes were brought from hamachi crudo to escolar sashimi to big eye tuna, and tuna belly.  This was some of the freshest seafood I've had in Las Vegas.  The dishes were very creative too.  A standout here was the Poke with macadamia nuts, crispy onions, togarashi, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, and Shoju with green onion pancakes.  What a great combination of flavors.  There were other dishes each worthy of mention but I will lack space to name them all.  We then moved to the hot dishes with Thai chicken wings, onion soup, bacon and eggs ravioli, branzino, Grandma's meatballs with pork neck ragu, sea bass tails and belly, and a vegetable medley of carrots, French beans, and broccoli rabe.  I am known for not eating wings.  These are so good and done so well, they're a delight and I'd go back solely for them.  The onion soup with its pretzel crouton and gruyere cheese ravioli was also a big winner.  I also have to mention the sea bass tails and belly.  Excellent!  Moving on to desserts, we were served Adult Root Beer floats made with Not Your Father's Root Beer (5.9% alcohol) with vanilla bean and cinnamon ice cream.  My float was made with Coke and there were gingersnaps served with the floats.  Along with this we had turtle cheesecake, carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and salted caramel panna cotta. A double espresso over ice was an additional enjoyment to the sweets!  Service was excellent!  My iced tea glass was constantly replaced with a fresh one and water was added to glasses often.    Some of the items we had are not on the menu but may be when it's finalized--we were trying them out.    Herringbone really adds to the restaurants at Aria.",

We thought the chairs would be nice, but as I was actually pretty hungry the food became more difficult to eat because of the low tables. So I would say sit at the bar if you actually plan on eating and the lounge if you plan on just snacking.  We tried the whole fish ceviche, the octopus, the agnolotti, and the crab cake poppers. The whole fish ceviche was great-- a little spicy, a little sweet, and a little tart. The octopus was excellent too. The agnolotti with butternut squash had a nice touch of sweetness and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Finally, the crab cake popper was a nice twist on a crab cake.   We also tried the espresso pudding and it was excellent. I usually don't like pudding but I found myself really liking this one! As for drinks, we tried the French press without realizing it was $14, so probably wouldn't order that one again.  Great option in Aria.",

But I don't know what happened to management in the last 8/9 months because it hasn't been the same and I keep thinking maybe it'll get back to what it was but no.   Today's brunch was the worst in history. It was 100F outside plus 31% humidity, and I made the mistake of arriving at 10:30 am when it seemed bareable (and the only ambience is outside) so asked for a 2 seater outside. At around 11/1130 it was sweltering and I noticed our busser sweating into the drinks and I was uncomfortably hot and asked for the misters to be turned on, they kept telling us any minute now any minute now. They finally came on at 12:30, an hour later, and stayed on for 10 minutes! When I realized they weren't turning it back on I asked for a seat inside and they told me there weren't any. I went in to use the restroom 10 minutes later and half the dining room was empty!   I finally couldn't stand it anymore and asked for the manager. Because it seemed like a management issue, my server was nice and wonderful actually and I just just knew it had to be management, so finally the manager came around and he had the audacity to say \"we'll what do you do for a living?\" Are you effing serious? And the he proceeds to circle back and try to say is his waitresses fault because she didn't bring it to his attention in time even though I witnessed her asking him about it 3 times. Even the busser agreed that everyone was sweating and uncomfortable and could not enjoy themselves but this idiot was set in blaming everyone but himself and then tried to compare himself to other people. Are you honestly serious or just a complete idiot.   Because of you, whoever you're idiot ass is, on August 12th at 2pm, you're an absolute moron who has 0% experience doing what you're doing and I don't know what you did to gain favor but you outta be fired. Several people were complaining and you kept brushing it off and then acted like a complete a-hole when it was brought to your attention. We explained to you that we were lifelong customers and you made us miserable and you did nothing to rectify it. Goodbye, never again. You made it such a memorably horrible experience. What kind of moron do they hire to be their manager. Do you really want to compare what YOU do to what I do?! What a joke. Unprofessional slob who manipulated and lied his way to a management position, Hakkasan group better start checking up on this resumes.",

I like their chairs by the bar, it's so comfy.  -service: servers were nice and they have passion on their jobs.  -salad: they were so nice to separate our food into two plates without extra charge. The salad was nice, each of the green was so fresh, the dressing paired well with the whole salad. Enjoyed it. -the mushroom pasta was good too. This dish was hot, and they didn't let us know, it's pretty spicy, but the pasta was in good texture, not over cooked. The source was mixed well with the pasta, they gave us two eggs since we share.  We will come back for more, since we didn't feel extremely hungry after spa",

We were in town for the international jewelry show so we wanted to start our week off with a really good dinner.   Food - if I could rate this individually it would get the full 5 stars. The food was fresh and very flavorful. We had the seafood pasta, salmon dinner plate and the roasted chicken. All the entrees were great!   SERVICE-to me dining out is a lot about how you are treated and served. When I go to a place were I am spending more then a few bucks, then I am expecting to be treated that way. We ordered a bottle of wine from the menu and it was out (No problem we'll get something else). The waiter brought over a few samples to try of what the had and then disappeared. We waited and waited and finally had to flag down someone else to let them know what we wanted.  We went with a nice bottle of prosecco for $70. Our waiter brought it, made the first pour and then left it in the chilled bucket. We never saw him again.  After that I knew this night wasn't going to be what I thought. The manager must of known we weren't happy so he came to apologize and said he would take care of us for the inconvenience. His offering was a sliver of cheese cake and a mini cupcake. Bite size desserts....  When I go out and spend a more then decent amount of money your expectations are at a different level. Unfortunately this place didn't do it for me.",

Service was good and attentive, promptly clearing dishes and folding napkin each time u left your seat. Brunch was $60 per person and doesn't include drinks. The main dishes on our visit was the lobster and king crab legs, ayce. They had raw oysters, smoked salmon, poke, wagyu beef, lettuce wraps, omelets made to order and other made to order to dishes. Check website which describes the menu items. I would have preferred the lobster and crab legs steamed, but it was still very good. We had brunch from approximately 10 am to about 11:00 am, light crowd which was good and very good TV sets for the Sunday football games. Recommend giving the restaurant a try, note pricey so eat the high end items. Foodie out",

    "text": "We went to Herringbone for Thanksgiving dinner with 10 people after seeing their 4 course Thanksgiving menu online. The ambiance is nice and the food was delicious.   Unfortunately, we had a serious customer service issue that soured our experience. When we sat down we were informed that they would only make the Thanksgiving menu if the entire table was getting it even though what I had seen online did not say that. We had 10 people and trying to get that many people to agree on anything is nearly impossible! One couple wanted to do a seafood feast instead because they don't care for turkey. It was not as though they weren't ordering hundreds of dollars of food and drinks! The Thanksgiving dinner was served family style but they only made an amount for the number of people that were eating it and you couldn't ask for more (we tried with the oysters) so there wasn't a concern that those 2 people would be eating something without paying. I have no idea of the logic behind this rule...I see the point for a table of 2 or even 4 but for a table of 10!? We spoke to the waiter and he was nice but it was such an issue that he re-seated our 2 friends at another table by themselves, at this point, 2 others of our group were so disgusted they walked out! So now we're taking up a table for 10 with 6 people and a table for 2 and our \"friendsgiving\" is missing 4 of our friends! We asked for a manager who was apologetic but wouldn't make a decision and had to go ask the chef. Finally, they agreed to let our 2 friends with the seafood feast move back and sit at the very end of our table so that we could eat together. We then had a nice meal but while the food was good, the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths. To be treated this way at a fine dining restaurant is not acceptable.   I would not go back to Herringbone nor recommend it for this reason.",

The appetizers and salad we had were super refreshing and tasty which was the feta and watermelon salad and also the yellowtail sashimi topped with a mango salsa and jalapenos. The signature Cocktail The Drifting Mistress was great and well balanced. For dinner the whole grilled Branzino was to die for. A super light fish served with a nice fennel salad it was perfect. On top of it all the outdoor ambiance was super cool and the service was fabulous.  I definitely will be returning soon!! Can't wait to take my friends and family!",

The service was impeccable from helping us decide on the various choices for food to the specialty drinks. However, the best part of Herringbone was the food. Chef Geno prepared one phenomenal dish after another with a really nice presentation!  We started with a fried rice dish that was unbelievable. I didn't realize how good fried rice could taste.  We tried the salmon tartar that was served in an upside down martini glass with shrimp that was delicious. And the tuna poke was amazing. For dinner we shared the Pork chop and a special seafood dish that was out of this world.  Overall this was one of the best dinners I have ever had. Looking forward to going back to try their outdoor space.",

The atmosphere was very loud, there was a large group, (Adobe convention) having drinks and they surrounded the tables people were trying to eat at.  I think the management should have tried to keep the group better corralled in the lounge area.  Not pleasant trying to enjoy dinner conversation while surrounded by intoxicated people talking about how great Adobe products are. We have eaten here before when the outside patio area was open.

We had multiple servers ask us if we wanted drinks, then a different server brought them out. Seemed a little unorganized - we didn't have all the place settings and then there was a dirty dish on the table. They only do the brunch menu until 4 on Sundays, so no meatballs :( They were also out of one of their signature items the chicken wings. We had the branzino ceviche, which was actually the best dish. Shrimp and grits, very bland with no depth of flavor. Crab benny was deep fried yet despite that it was dry and meh. Overall, not worth it and it's rough when their service is not very good.",

There were plenty of open seating inside, but the blond reception told us there are no tables available inside and took us to the outside patio where I saw not one single soul in sight. It was hot as hell. Ain't nobody gonna eat outside when it's that scorching hot. Not sure if there's a strict dress code at this establishment, but we were dressed casual because we were walking around all day site seeing. Although I did notice that some folks were in their clubbing outfits. I felt so discrimated. It felt like the reception took us outside where no one would see us. WTF? Talk about discrimination. Might add racial discrimination. I was there with my wife and her niece who just came from Korea. Trying to show her good times and this place just effed it all up. Thanks guys!",

You also are given a separate menu to order from ala carte that is included in the buffet. Alternatively, you do have the option to just order from the ala carte menu and pay per item - but for the prices the better choice would be to do the buffet. In addition, you also have the choice to add a beverage package. We opted to add the premium drink package. It did add an additional $65 per person but it was extremely worth it.  We were one of the first tables sat and brunched until the near closed of the brunch hour. Our server was awesome and we passed on the mimosas and was provided just the vevue champagne. I doubt the server expected we were going to sit there and brunch for 5 hours! We definitely drank well over the price of the package. Unfortunately it did leave me with little room to enjoy all the food. The seafood was extremely fresh which I love - but the star for me was the orange ricotta pancakes! So light and airy and tasted like a lovely citrus cloud with chocolate chips! Definitely recommend the full food and drink package experience! The only downside was that you're not allowed to leave the restaurant with your glass of champagne.",

They have some nice seating outside, but since it was still warm we ate inside.  They have a good wine list, so we ordered a Napa Cab.  Service was excellent--our server was fast, friendly, and gave really good advice.  I ordered the scallops with pea risotto.  It was outstanding.  The scallops were large and cooked to perfection.  They just melted in my mouth.  The risotto was the perfect complement, rich and buttery--just absolutely delicious.  One great recommendation from the server was the brussels sprouts with candied pecans.   Vegetables should not taste that good--and another great match with the scallops.   I could have had three orders of this.  The person I was with had the salmon that was also wonderful.  It tasted nice and fresh and cooked just right.  They were setting up for a buffet when we were leaving that also looks fun.  This is an excellent restaurant and I will definitely be back.",

BEST DECISION EVAR.  Service was impeccable, I mean really awesome servers, hostess, all of it was great.   The food here was nothing short of perfect. I don't believe I would add/subtract a thing from the dishes we ordered.  Dozen kumamoto oysters - 5 STARS is an understatement. Absolutely without a doubt the best oysters my bf and I have ever had. We both fell in love with the kimchi sauce they provided us with, but seriously these things didn't even need lemon they were amazing on their own.   Fish tacos - 5 STARS. We got a grilled and a fried and I gotta say I preferred the grilled. Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly in both types of tacos. Oh and because we waited a little long for our food we were sent out an additional taco, awesome.   The Dinghy - 4 STARS. Half lobster, King crab legs, 2 jumbo prawns, 4 oysters. All of the items were fresh and flavorful, but a little pricey for what you get.   Salad - 4 STARS. We were provided a salad for waiting a little long for our food which was nice especially because it was a really great salad with excellent dressing.   I'd gladly return here any time I'm in Vegas.",

First off, skip the traditional mimosa cause the orange juice they use is terrible (but I also hate orange juice) ask for the watermelon juice instead. THIS IS A MUST!! It is so good. They use La Marca prosecco for their bottomless options, but you can upgrade to something nicer for a marginal fee. I didn't find it necessary, but you do you.   Also, the bellinis are delicious too! The peach puree is so good.   The buffet for brunch has so many seafood options, literally couldn't stop eating. Crawfish, shrimp, seared tuna, crab legs... the works! They also had prime rib (the secret to my heart). Also lots of salad options, waffles, etc.   We were here for my bachelorette weekend after a vicious night of drinking and two girls in our party barely ate, the waitress took some pity on them and didn't charge them for food since all they really did was nibble on fries from the a la carte menu cause they were so hung over.   Can't wait for our next Vegas trip so I can eat here again! The outdoor seating is really nice.",

It was pretty crowded due to the football games being on, but we were still able to get a table inside.   After reading through some other reviews I knew I had to try the oysters. I also had the steak tartare and herringbone sundae to share for dessert. The oysters were by far my favorite part of this meal. They were super fresh and I loved the spicy kimche sauce to go with them. The steak tartare was good as well, but I would have liked a bit less of the sauce. The dessert was super tasty, certainly enough to share between two people.   I can't wait to come back here again soon. If it's warm enough I recommend sitting outside and enjoying their beautiful patio!",

    "text": "1.12.17 2:30pm 5 star!  As a matter of fact New Years Eve was also 5 Star.  Of course, I started w/ my favorite 1/2 lbs. ALASKAN KING CRAB cause you can never go wrong w/ it & I wanted my parents to try that first on New Years Eve.  They loved it so today we started there again.  I love the devil dip!  A blow me away evening at Herringbone consisted of the following, but first & foremost, thank you Chef Jessica, Manager Cefrin, Chawwn, Rolando.. WOW.    TUNA POKE.. Mom & dad had never wanted to try raw tuna or sashimi.  The beautiful presentation & freshness of the tuna made them a bit adventurous & they LOVED it.  The wonderful chip, possibly a fried seaweed & sea salt blend to accompany the fresh tuna tartare w/ Maui onion & small pieces of toasted Macadamia nuts were remarkable.  Not a rough chip cause once the tuna met the chip it kind of melted in your mouth together.  Perfectly planned combination.  JUMBO SHRIMP.. Mom is not fond of cold shrimp, but this was the second time she had it here & absolutely loved it too.  The cocktail sauce & presentation on ice in a brass type of rustic basin, similar to how the King Crab comes out was just fantastic.  Hearty & filling.    BAJA SHRIMP COCKTAIL.. a SUPER tasty 'Bloody Mary' or a Michelada that I am still craving!  Served w/ Clamato, lots of fresh shrimp, pico de gallo, avocado, all mixed together.  Garnished w/ a Tajin type of Cajun mix on top of a couple of Jicama sticks, a jumbo shrimp, a celery stick & celery flower, & a side of Saltines, which I prefer the Lavash, it's way better than the Saltines.   They no longer have the Shrimp Ceviche that I posted before FYI, this is now their Shrimp Ceviche.  I wouldn't consider it a Ceviche, but honestly it is filling & fantastic.  A bit tough to share, but an absolute must if you love Bloody Mary's & Shrimp.  Wow so good!!  I can't wait to order it again w/ my brunch or for my brunch!    LOBSTER ROLL.. the salad mixed w/ the lobster did not overwhelm the chucks of lobster at all.  I was happily surprised.  The roll was slightly sweet & perfect to share although it doesn't look like it is.  Once you split it in two, wow the lobster salad is really packed in & filling!  I like to get a few dishes & share so this is one that you can get w/ the King Crab or Baja Shrimp or eat all alone.  Also I saw the Cobb Salad & cannot wait to try it.  It is ENORMOUS & looks like it would be a nice shareable dish w/ the Roll or anything really.    CHEFS SPECIAL SCALLOPS WRAPPED IN BACON W/ RISOTTO.. I am not a fan of scallops, however this special comes w/ three bacon wrapped scallops so I tried one.  Not a grain of sandy taste, that I cringe to when I've had some of the best of the best scallops.  The bacon was a perfect crispy addition to the scallop & PERFECTLY cooked risotto.  The risotto was phenomenal.  Creamy & a nice bite, as risotto should be.  I couldn't get enough.    GRILLED ORGANIC CHICKEN SANDWICH.. shared between mom & I.  Cooked perfectly & moist w/ my fav heirloom tomatoes, Burrata, charred red onions, Dijon & aioli.  No onions next time, but I'm picky, it was so very tasty w/ a nice homemade tasting bun.  Very soft.  Both the Lobster Roll & this brunch item come w/ either a salad or fries.  The fries are unbelievably seasoned & at the end of your meal you will notice that you've eaten them all!  Fabulous & worth every calorie & bite.    HERRINGBONE SUNDAE.. Excellent!  5 STARS Pouring the salted caramel onto the combination of honeycomb, Oreo & coffee gelato, Chantilly cream w/ the toasted smooth creamy marshmallow was hard to describe.  Our favorite dessert so far here is the best way.  It wasn't a s'mores or Rocky Road, but had it's own uniqueness that is definitely something that you should start with first, if possible lol.  Mmm mmm mmm!    My least fav dessert is the Chocolate, Sea Salt & Caramel.  All of my favorites combined!  Except I find it super tough to cut into the ice cream & Nutella gelato.  Dad said it needed to be warmed up for a few seconds.  I agree since this is the second time we've had it.  The candied hazelnuts, chocolate crumble & presentation are wonderful though.  New Years Eve brunch & today's brunch were both mind-blowing.  The Hostess's greet you w/ smiles & are very nice.  Thankfully they added more comfy seating versus how it was in the beginning.  They do still have the couches outlining the restaurants, which I think are nice for cocktails.  Outside seating was closed due to weather, but I took a look & it is beautiful for when it is nice out w/ a view of the pool.  They have clearly stepped up their game since multiple times being here.  I don't like to leave a bad review so will often frequent a place to get a good feel so after I left my review, I came back twice.  Both of which, I left craving dishes, excited to go back & try new dishes, also impeccable service.    Thank you once again Chef Jessica, Manager Cefrin, Chawwn, Rolando!  You made our evening amazing!",

    "text": "Buyer beware. The $59 all-you-can-eat weekend brunch does NOT include coffee and orange juice. It's $4/coffee and $8/orange juice, making your actual total $71 plus tax and tip, assuming you like coffee and OJ with brunch.  Which is ludicrous because:  1. Coffee costs them what, 10 cents? So to upcharge for coffee but not for say, the shrimp or salmon that's part of the buffet, is just tacky.  2. The coffee arrives at the END of your meal, not the beginning, as was the case with our lackluster service.  3. The buffet includes fresh-squeezed watermelon juice and berry smoothies, but they decided to charge extra for the one staple that most people want, orange juice, instead of just placing it in the section already containing the other juices/smoothies.  As someone who's studied pricing extensively, the whole thing felt like pricing manipulation designed to lure you in with the $59 price point while hoping to get $71 out of you. For most people who want a higher-end brunch and want to avoid the longer lines at the regular hotel buffet, the $59 price is just within the threshold of still feeling comfortable, but $71 is above that threshold, so they sneakily withhold coffee and OJ from the buffet to extract that extra money out of you.",

I started with service because it's basically the best part of the establishment.  This isn't a great place for vegetarians.  The options were pretty limited and I have to say the best items I had were the duck-fat fries and the scrambled eggs.  Yup.  I had duck-fat fries.  Also, the eggs were scrambled because they didn't have a variety of vegetable items for their omelet.  I also had some oysters, which were fresh, but not amazing.  The rest of the items for vegetarians were basically the dessert bar.  I did one trip of half a plate of food, and decided that was it.  We paid around $75/ person and I did not think it was worth it.  As a matter of fact, 3 of my other friends agreed we weren't impressed and would most likely not return.  It's too bad because we really wanted to like this place.  Perhaps the Herringbone in LA might have more options.",

They couldn't seat us until half our party was there--ok I get it, the rules.  But the restaurant was empty (other than the bar) and our EMPTY table was right there glaring at us.  They insisted we go to the bar, but the bar had most of their seats taken and we didn't feel like standing.  With no reception area to have guests sit, I asked if they could make an exception and seat us ten feet away at our table.  They said no.  So I sat on a planter until my hangover got the best of me and I insisted we be sat.  Sometimes you just need someone to bend rules! We got some drinks in us (hair of the dog) and the rest of our party arrived and lunch was served.  They were nice and the food was ok, but the seat drama kind of killed the vibe. An expensive buzz-kill.  Oh well, next time!",

The weather had been great, so we got a seat on the outside patio which was super nice. I love the modern romantic decor with lots of green plants and white garden decorations.   The food was really delicious. I had been to the San Diego location in the past and really liked it there too. The plate setting was presented beautifully along with the food. The drinks are nicely crafted and tasted very good as well. The highlight of our meal was the hazelnut chocolate tart at the very end. Neither of us have a sweet tooth but we both loved this particular dessert. Must order!  Service was sweet, nice and attentive. Bathrooms are very clean and well designed. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Stopped in here for a very satisfying lunch during my recent Vegas trip. The space is open, airy and very easy to navigate in a wheelchair. Since it was Mid-October and even in Vegas, there was a little nip in the air I opted to skip the beautiful patio and sit inside. The only negative to this was there was construction going on nearby so it made it quite noisy.  I started with an interesting Cocktail called, It' Still Hot in Mexico.  It was sweet/savory concoction with Espolon Reposado Tequila, Thai Chili, Agave, Lime, Cilantro and Cucumber Juice. It looked like a Green Smoothie, but had a strong, boozy kick and little heat. Although not brave enough to try the Chili Pepper garnish, I did enjoy the two fresh slices of Cucumber while waiting for my food.  My Lunch selection was The Lobster Roll with Maine Lobster, Lemon and Creme Fraiche with Boardwalk Fries.  The Lobster Roll was among the best I've ever had. Just enough Creme Fraiche and Lemon to enhance the sweetness of the perfectly cooked Lobster. I even loved the slightly sweet, split and grilled Hot Dog Bun the Lobster was tucked into. The Boardwalk Fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned ( I think with Old Bay) with a fluffy interior and crisp exterior.  Although quite full, I couldn't resist Dessert. I chose the Butterscotch Panna Cotta with Chantilly Cream, Caramel Corn and Chocolate Crunch.  The perfectly light, sweet ending to great lunch. When the plate came out I figured I would leave the Caramel Corn scattered around the plate untouched, but after one taste, I finished it all!  My server was friendly and knowledgeable, but the noise from the construction made it hard to hear. I will definitely will be returning to Herringbone in the hopefully near, future!",

The bar is probably one the largest I've seen for any restaurant on the strip so far. There are a variety of seating arrangements to meet any type of dining experiences. As much as i enjoyed the dinner meal, the dessert was the extra topping of full joy. This is one dining restaurant i would surely comeback to anytime.",

The octopus is perfectly cooked and it is not chewy.  Their soup is super creamy with a good balance taste and not overly salty for a typical crab soup. 5/5  I love their fast service and they always check on you to see how you are doing.  4.5/5  This place is a little of the expensive side but it is worth the visit!

While visiting vegas I was looking for a non brunch buffet with a cool outdoor vibe. Luckily I stumbling upon herringbone which pretty much hit the mark for what I was looking for.   Now their brunch club does have a buffet-esq quality but it's really just 4 \"interactive stations\" set up. They also have a menu of items the kitchen will make for you, this is all included in the cost for the brunch.   The seafood station is worth the money for the brunch club alone. Delicous raw oysters, huge cocktail shrimp, lobster tail and crab legs. Also featured were several poke and seafood salads. The devil sauce was amazing on the lobster tail.   From the menu my friend and I split the fish tacos, Loco benny, and chocolate chip pancakes. The tacos were really good. The benny had a great sauce but the egg was sunny side up and way undercooked. The chocolate chip pancakes were rich and a nice dessert alternative.   The other stations they had were salads, a craving station of meats and also smoked salmon with bagel chips and cream cheese. And a station for desserts.  We also opted for unlimited mimosas for an additional 35 each. This also included Bellinis  (peach or strawberry) and bloody marys. The strawberry bellini was my fave.   Definitely get a table outside as they had a DJ and it's a really great vibe near the pool. The server was great and very attentive and didn't mind that we were there for awhile.   I would definitely come back here when in vegas for an amazing brunch.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch a couple days before Christmas.  Made a reservation on Open Table, so that we were sure to have a seat ready.  I know sometimes (having lived in Vegas) that without a res, brunch can be difficult to get into mid day.  We were seated in the middle of the room at a two-top.  Given the run down by our friendly female server that there is a small paper menu of items included that are made fresh to order in addition to a station by station buffet around us.  That alone is $59 per person.  If you would like to have a mimosa or bloody mary, they are $17 each, or you can do bottomless starting at $35 - $95 per person depending on the level of basic bubbly to premium bubbles.  I would suggest arriving early (11am) and staying to watch a game and leaving at  2 or 3pm when it ends.  Then you can get breakfast and lunch in. lol  We did two brunches, a coffee, and I had one bottomless basic bubbly package.  Our total before tip was $170.  Very expensive for an afternoon meal.  COME hungry!  On the bright side, the food was good.  Excellent, no, but good.  We ordered couple items straight from the menu.  The orange ricotta chocolate chip pancakes with tree sap (in less fancy wording \"maple syrup\").  The chips were more like pistoles (the large round pellets), and not chips.  Good quality chocolate.  The whipped cream melted off the pancakes faster than I could get an insta worthy photo.  Some segments of oranges ontop.  The Egg Al Forno is basically baked eggs, pork gravy, garlic confit and Parm.  Served with toast, but I wasn't about to fill up on bread.  This was tasty, but I was over it after about three bites.  The manager made a stop by the table to check in.  They are at least attentive.    Stations:  Carving meats, shellfish, lox and cream cheese, omelettes, waffles, bacon, and my favorite stone crab (but they were small).  There was a salad station in the back, and a cute cart with desserts in the center of the room with filler decor like packaged mini donuts, jellybeans, Good and Plenties, and mini cupcakes, red velvet whoopie pies, and some pretty but tasteless meringue kisses.  To get the most bang for my buck, I stuck with the meats and fishes.  Had a few bites of salad.  The desserts were terribly disappointing and overly sweet.    At least the juices with my $35 mimosas were freshly squeezed.  And we watched an entire football game.  There was a DJ too, very interesting mix of music.  I definitely ate enough to have the energy needed for the electric car I rented.",

I got the NY steak suggested by our friendly, slow waiter. Had nasty cilantro on it which was not noted on the menu. Took it off and really it was a basic steak for $60. No sides of course. 2nd beer took another 15 minutes plus.   No excuse for such poor speed and the prices are just way beyond the quality.  I did give 2 stars cause there was a choice of seating and the beer was cold.",

    "text": "Herringbone has a great brunch menu and I would go back in a heartbeat next time I'm in Las Vegas area! The inclusive brunch option was excellent and included a great seafood bar (crap, lobster, shrimp, oysters and more). My favorite items from the cook to order menu was the Loco Moco and Duck Fat Fries. The inclusive option was a bit pricey but was well worth it considering it was all you can eat / order. They also had an all you can drink Bloody Mary option which was a perfect twist to quench your brunching thirst!",

    "text": "From a food stance this establishment provides a great spread. Where they need improvement is at the hostess stand. There is a chalkboard sign that states \"Sunday Brunch with bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's for $35.00.\" The signage is misleading and False. Even when asking the hostess what's included in the $35.00,  I was informed brunch was and we could choose from menus options as well as stations. I thought it was a fabulous offering and agreed to be seated.   Upon being sat I asked again what's included and was explained the same info. No one ever indicated nor was there pricing on the menus or explained  from the server that brunch was $59.00 and in addition to was a $35.00 upgrade fee for the bottomless mimosas.   The 200.00 bill was a bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, I tipped 18% and then aired my concerns with the manager. Who elected to apologize yet offer no correction to the bill.   To top off the experience I was double billed. They ran my credit card twice. I don't know about you all but never have I ever paid $400+ for brunch.  Overall pretty disappointed from this dining experience.   I'm a gourmand and lover of food and enjoy dining out. If the transparency of pricing was made clear I would have left with a better taste in my mouth.   I wrote the establishment I hope they rectify their mistake. I also would urge Herringbone to own their pricing and clearly label their menus.  We dine out to enjoy delectables we don't often indulge in. If they come with a high price tag it's only reasonable to share the True costs with the patrons. Being wholly in their pricing to the consumer in the future is requested. Trickery or False advertising is not a place I would ever recommend. Luring people in on Falsehoods is bad business. Again your food was delightful and the experiences could of been a 5 Star review, but your dishonesty and lack of ownership in the matter resulted in this buyer beware review.",

I've been here on a couple occasions, both for dinner and the most recent - for lunch. I came here at lunch looking for scallops but didn't realize that the lunch menu is incredibly abbreviated, there's almost none of the dinner entrees on it.  For lunch, we ordered the lunch box - I had a small trout caesar to start, and another side salad with my lobster roll. It's a little confusing, the \"little gem\" salad is actually the trout caesar, just named differently on here for some reason. The portion sizes were decent, not overwhelming large but not like some fancy French restaurant. As far as seafood goes, it's pretty fresh, especially considering you're out in the middle of the dessert and the nearest natural water source is very far.  I thought it was just a tad overpriced, but I'd come back -- for dinner, probably not for lunch.",

Lobster roll has a \"unique\" flavor profile. Very acidic and lemon-y with an interesting amount of pepper. Not a fan of the flavor combined with the fact that there proportion of meat to other items is off. Hard to taste the lobster with so much celery. Also, the meat used is mostly claw meat which is kind of a bummer for a $34 lobster roll. Surprised that when we complained and the manager came, they did not take it off the bill. We had come on consecutive lunches and ordered a substantial amount but when the bill came, it was still there. We had only taken two small bites out of the dish anyway.   Wings are incredible. Definitely would recommend again. They're cut them small so they're very convenient to eat.   Whole fish ceviche very good as well. Had a citrus fruit with it. Could not identify it but very delicious.",

Caesar salad was good but I've definitely had better, and fried shrimp looked amazing (didn't eat it myself everyone at the table seemed to like it). The tuna poke came with some type of seaweed chip was was good in and of itself but the tuna poke was not fresh and also stringy and tough.  I knew I should not have had a second bite because I spent the last half of my meal in the bathroom with food poisoning. Unfortunately I was not able to enjoy the lamb due to getting sick though the couple bites I had were good and it was very tender.  Ended with a couple bites of the chocolate caramel desert which was absolutely delicious.  Waiters and service was very attentive and friendly.  Not sure if I would come back.  Spending over $500 for 4 people you definitely would want everything to be flawless.",

Come with a friend who loves plating good creatively, and you're in it to win it.  My issue is that they are expensive. We are talking $60+ bottomless beverage packages per person and that doesn't include food. Granted, you can order a Bloody Mary or mimosas... but dang. This will break the bank if you're not careful. $150+ for a solo brunch (that includes tip) just isn't something I can get behind on a regular basis.  The service was great and attentive, but for a mostly DIY brunch, and as a LV Local, it's an experience I'll save when someone comes to town that I want to impress.",

The avocado salad was good but a little on the salty side.  The asparagus was inedible due to them being the size of tree branches covered in a tasteless hollandaise that would be beneath IHOP putting on Eggs Benedict at 3:00 AM.

    "text": "Just landed in Vegas and Herringbone was our first stop - was super convenient since we could walk to it from our hotel. It was also Super Bowl Sunday. This review is for the 'ALL YOU CAN EAT, BIG GAME EATS' menu that went on that day.   For $75 each, we had access to AYCE for the duration of the game.   Food included: Unlimited poke bar (with all the extras) Peel & eat prawns - Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce Nachos - chicken, queso, tortilla chips, black beans, tomato salsa, guacamole, scallions Pigs in a blanket (with house ketchup & mustard) Wings - pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce Meatballs - Nana's pork gravy, whipped ricotta, parsley Bobby's sliders - kobe beef, aged cheddar, grilled onions Boardwalk fries - old bay, malt vinegar aioli, ketchup, herbs Mexican street corn - chipotle aioli, scallions, cotija, cilantro  Boyfriend really wanted to see the game and eat, so I went along with his choice of restaurant and the menu had food I was fine with. There was no wait as we walked in and got seated. The atmosphere was loud with tons of guys chattering and drinking. Dozens of flat screen tvs were all over the walls. I guess Vegas has these AYCE buffets specifically during the big game cause it makes the whole event really fun/exciting. There was a deal for drinks going on and since my bf ordered one - he got put into some lottery and the hostesses kept giving him free Jack Daniels stuff lol that was cool I guess. He got some stickers, lip balm, and a necklace.  I liked the idea of the poke bar, and there were tortilla chips too! They had the raw seafood all laid out in the back of the restaurant. The tako (octopus) tasted a lil better than the poke (fish). Poke was mushy and soft - like it wasn't fresh or it was just sitting/marinating in sauce for too long. The shrimps were awesome though. Good size, crunchy, and tasted great dipped with ketchup. I also enjoyed the tomatoes and cucumbers - definitely helped to clear that fishy taste in my mouth in preparation for the rest of food on the menu.   I did not care for the corn, fries, nor the wings. The corn was covered in a lot of stuff and had waaay too much going on. Expected it to have tons of flavor but it just tasted dry with NO taste. Fries were okay. The wings were too spicy for me. My boyfriend liked the wings the most, and he also ended up eating the rest of the food.   My favorites were the pigs in a blanket and the sliders for sure. I think I was so hungry that I just really craved meat at the moment and all the other appetizers were not cutting it for me. Pigs in a blanket was nothing special...but it was filling. That's all I wanted. Tasted like regular mini hotdogs with ketchup and mustard. The sliders were AMAZING. Don't know what sauce the patty was covered in, but it was delicious. Wanted to eat more sliders but I couldn't..was too stuffed from just one. #smallstomachproblems   Wish we didn't order the nachos cause I wasn't expecting them to come in a large bowl. Honestly we just wanted to try a little bit of everything and went crazy ordering. Couldn't finish that along with the meatballs. The meatballs were gooOod, and we ended up taking that and the wings back to the hotel. The nachos were different and not to our liking. They didn't use regular melted cheddar cheese and the chicken was cold while everything else was kind of warm? It just didn't mix well together. I enjoyed a couple first bites of the nachos, but then I got tired of the taste later.   If we were more hungry, I think the AYCE deal would have been worth it. But my boyfriend and I agreed that for what we paid, we did not get our money's worth. That always seems like the case for these types of situations regarding buffets/AYCE. We just came for the convenience, fast service and the game.... not for the price or food. Probably should have came to Herringbone for their regular breakfast/lunch/dinner hours and maybe then we'd feel like we actually got what we paid for.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for Sunday brunch at Herringbone on my most recent visit to Las Vegas and requested a table outside.  It had a bit of a \"clubby\" vibe with a dj spinning music and younger diners sitting out there vs. inside the restaurant where it was more mellow with grown folk.    I ordered their non-alcoholic Patio Crusher which was refreshing but a bit steep at $8 especially when there was so much ice in the glass.  To eat I had their La Jolla fish tacos that I ordered fried and with a side of mixed greens salad.  The food was ok but not special enough to make me want to come back for it.  Really, about three stars for the food, but the servers were friendly and the ambiance outside was nice (though not quite my scene) so I'm rounding this place up to four stars.",

It was my wife's birthday, therefore, we got complimentary cake after main dishes. OMG it was so beautiful, yet we were so surprised by giant worm on the side. I think it sticked to piece of flower that was used for deco.  It was very big and still wriggling.  After we reorted, server just took the plate and we got new cake.  Thank you for complimentary cake, but I needed just a bit of apology instead of new cake.  I'm not really sure If i will get back to here again.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of coming over to Herringbone for brunch, everytime I come to Vegas. But this time, I have to say how dissapointed i was. There was nothing wrong with the service, but more of the quality of the food they offered for the Saturday brunch. I usually come for the fresh seafood section. This time, the oyster was not fresh, and was sitting there for long time, the prep chef did not even bother refilling the seafood section at all, unless you ask them to. The poke was overly salty (all you can taste is soy sauce) The fresh seafood section was in poor quality, the salads were soggy, as if it was just standing there collecting dust. I have to say, I am dissapointed just because i've been coming here for 2 years now and the quality of the food was just way down. I noticed recently how theres barley people in the restraunt now, before I had to make reseervation and wait afterwards. I think the managment should really focus more on the quality of the food from now on.",

I think when we visited, they just opened and we're still working out a few kinks.  Plus, they didn't have the lobster Baja....which I see on the menu now.  If they have it, it's an absolute must!  Also ordered the wings which were amazing....the meat basically fell off the bone and was super flavorful.  Another must have is the whole fish ceviche (assuming you enjoy raw fish).  All in all, food is delicious.  Even though there is so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, this place will always be one of the stops when we visit.  As always, my opinion is just that.  Please visit and decide for yourself!",

Noticed other customers around were also complaining of the service. A lot of waiting for service and your server not to be found.   Only good thing about the place was the music and decor.   Would I come again?  Probably not. There's better food, better service, and more reasonable price restaurants around the area worth going to instead.",

Why four? Because that is how many we ate - even after we told them we didn't want them since they came out with our dinner. The managers logic when I questioned his statement \"because they were already shucked\".  We ordered three rounds of drinks that took a minimum of 25 minutes to arrive. To the three missed items we never received.   The food was good. Service was a disaster. The kicker was they didn't even offer a dime off! Apparently business must be great since customer service isn't a priority. Perhaps the $800 bill we had wasn't a big deal.",

    "text": "Service was a little slow at times and music was a little loud, but that doesn't take away from a truly great brunch.  Large portions, everlasting bellinis, and truly no rush.    We went for a noon brunch and left around 4:30pm.  You heard that correctly, a truly everlasting brunch for 4.5 hours and constantly getting refills.  We were never judged, never shunned, and always had full glasses.  Stupendous service.  We sat outside and there really wasn't any of a crowd considering it was primetime Sunday.  We ordered the breakfast nachos and the loco moco (beef with eggs and rice).  We wanted to take a different route with brunch this time so stayed away from the typical omelette or benedict.  The nachos were very good - soft yet not damp.  The beans and runniness of the eggs really gave it a nice flavor and the dish spiced just to our liking.  The loco moco was a very interesting dish as rice is not my first thought when it comes to brunch.  It came with a freshly prepared wagyu steak and 2 eggs over a bed of rice.  The beef itself was perfect and the sauce was a tasty thick sauce; perfect to start the morning.  Add in some fresh bread and we were in heaven.  The bellinis were super strong and always fresh.  I liked the strawberry-yuzu better than the peach, but they allow you to go back and forth so no worries if you can't make up your mind.  And we ended with a nice raspberry cheesecake with mango sorbet.  A perfect, filling meal.  The waiters were great at giving us privacy yet still knowing when to be heard.  The only issue there was the process of getting extras such as tobasco sauce or a new napkin.  The process always involved multiple waiters passing along the request like telephone so it did take a few minutes longer than normal.  We sat out on the deck which was perfect as the weather held up nicely.  There was a DJ who had the music on a bit too loud, but it wasn't STK volume just a little too high.  It is outside near the pool so maybe they just set the level and leave it there all year even when the pool is closed for the season.  One of the best brunches in Vegas hands down.  And it's also a nice change from your typical French variety brunch.  Still has an upscale, loungy feel with great food, but a nice change to the menu offerings.  Give Herringbone a try if you are a brunch fanatic.",

We ordered them and about 5-7 mins later the waiter said the kitchen was working on them - they came out soon after and the chips were soggy and cold ..??

First night in the Aria and less than impressed with the service we received here.  First of all, the hostesses are extremely unfriendly. Seems like it's a bother to you that they have to do anything. The restaurant was about half full and we were first told it would be an hour then the hostess said a table got up, but we watched that dirty table not be touched or cleaned for 20 min while we waited- once again the hostesses were no help in that.  Got seated finally and someone came over after about 10 min and poured water, but no mention of any other drinks. Eventually a girl came over and said our server was really busy so she would take our drink order- we went ahead and ordered everything since we had now been sitting for a good 20 min with nothing to show for it.   Finally saw our actual server about 30 min in when he brought our first round of drinks. 45 min in we finally got \"apps.\" Some of the group started with salads or should have but for some reason they brought oysters, one salad and one entree. Oysters Rockefeller and melon salad were both awesome btw, the food was spot on.  About 20 min and empty plates later I finally see our waiter to let him know someone got their entree and not salad. He was quick to blame everyone else. He then proceeds to tell us they haven't even started our entrees- mind you there's maybe 8-10 total tables full in the restaurant. My boyfriend was a little annoyed to find out they hadn't started our dinner for no reason... servers response was \"well what do you want me to do? I can put your entrees in now if that's what you want.\" Umm yes... that's what we want.. dinner and without having to tell you... thought that's why we ordered.   My boyfriend finally asked for a manager whom was very pleasant and sent out an extra appetizer which we were very appreciative of, but that the same time we had been sitting for over an hour and not had the dinner we ordered for apparently no reason. The manager also sent over deserts later.   All in all I can overlook certain things. Had the server provided great service or even been around I could've dealt with the long wait for food. Most of the food was very good, probably would've been more enjoyable under different circumstances.   My group is praying this type of experience isn't the norm for Aria or any nicer restaurant on the Strip as we are here for a week for my Birthday. This one really put a bad taste in my mouth about a reputable brand.",

There was a long table filled on one end of the floor, and the center of the floor was taken up by couch seating for lounging and also filled with parties of people. Everyone seemed pretty on top of each other, seeing as there wasn't much room to walk in between, but then we opted to sit outside (it was just opened up).  Outside was gorgeous. I could spend all day and night there. The ambiance was relaxing, cool and casual. Palm trees and spray misters surrounded the whole rooftop and it was so relaxing that I di not want to leave. Not to mention that since it was so hot out in the middle of July, no one opted to sit outside except for maybe two other couples that we shared the roof with. I'll say it again, gorgeous.   Our dinners were divine. They have a strict Ocean-to-Table menu mindset. We were excited to get our seafood fix here for our vacation. I got something on special, a branzino with some arugula seafood salad. I hadn't had this type of fish yet and it was very flavorful. My boyfriend indulged in Sea Bass all week long and he took advantage of their specialty here. Fantastic and light. But surprisingly the star of the dinner would have to be those potatoes. Our waiter was very excited to pair our dinners with a side of these potatoes because he impressed upon us that they would pair very nicely with both of our choices of dinners..and oh it did. Those potatoes, there wasn't a spot left in that bowl of potatoes. And to be honest, I probably could have ate another bowl if they brought us another. That good.  So first, sit outside if you can, order anything seafood related (because that's why you came here) and definitely the potatoes on the side.",

It was also 105 degrees outside but the multiple misters and fan kept us comfortable and cool. Children are not allowed inside but i was actually surprised they even had a high chair available as this place is a little bit more trendy! my partner basically just had us meet inside but as soon as i arrived with our son we were automatically directed to our seat by the host (guess we were the only one who bought a baby with that night) staff was very accommodating and the food was great. Ambiance is really trendy and not exactly child friendly but overall nice dinner!",

We finally got our table and the menu is very limited and a bit expensive. We ordered 2 appetizers and each person ordered their own meal. For the most part, everything was tastey. I feel like they needed so add salt or fresh garlic to some of the dishes.   The manager was trying to accommodate us but it was already too late.",

Entrees included the scallops with risotto, salmon, and White Sea bass- all were divine! The highlight of the meal other than the death by potatoes (so freaking buttery, creamy, cheesy, and silky) is the dessert. The mason jar sundae was huge, perfect for sharing! My dad had the carrot cake with pineapple sorbet which he really enjoyed. Would love to bring the fiance here.",
