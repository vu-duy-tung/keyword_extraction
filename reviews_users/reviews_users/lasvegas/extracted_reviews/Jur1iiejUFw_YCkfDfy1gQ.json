When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said \"yes\".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill  Sanitary issue:  This restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart!   Pissed poor services: dim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..  Only table who did the family style order got their food as their order.  Forever food: Pork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing.   Ordering: Try to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant   Bottom line:  I HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO EAT HERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. SANITARY ISSUE, BAD SERVICES, FOREVER FOOD WILL NEVER SHOW UP FROM MENU,",

The steamed items were good; their chicken wrapped in bean curd was excellent. However, we found the deep fried items to be greasy. The deep fried calamari was actually just at room temperature, and the deep fried shrimp was rubbery. The crab claws were good. All in all, for the price I would have expected better.",

I don't know if it was intended like that so the customer could add seasonings to their liking, but the soup we got tasted pretty much like water. There was also a fried tofu dish that was pretty much tasteless, although the texture of it was nice.  Service is good. Waitress was friendly and accommodating for anything we needed.

I think I was expecting the inside to be much bigger for some reason..  So we got our usual stuff of this and that.. I noticed there weren't that many carts going around but during the duration of the time we were there I did she new stuff continually come out on the steamed cart.. No congee here though maybe only on the weekends...   Everything was pretty tasty my only problem was, with the exception of the steamed items, everything was not hot I mean most dimsum places items are at least warm but here they were just room temp.. Made me feel like they were definitely not fresh haha  BUT I think the prices here a tad lower than other places because our bill usually comes up to around $30 and here it was only a little over $20 for 2 ppl ~   Hot tip: like everyone else has already stated.. They have dim sum round the clock..Though It may be difficult for some to order off the dim sum menu if you don't know the name of the item ..",

I'd say Oakland or LA chinatown quality, below anything in SGV.   One thing that shocked me was the price.   It was nearly 30% to 50% more expensive than SGV.  Prices are what they are so you can't ding them for that.     Anyhow, what can I say, I'm spoiled living in SGV with excellent cheap, high quality food.",

    "text": "Have been going here for years- Dim Sum is usually good, not SF good, but decent. After today we will never go back. I have to say the staff has always been a tad rude, but since we really like Dim Sum we kept going. Today we went and there were 9 of us. My husband and I sat together, and our 17 year old daughter and her six out of town girlfriends sat together. After we finished we walked over to the girl's table and told them we were going to go start the cars. I was standing by the table trying to stay out of one of the woman's way who had a cart. Out of nowhere she literally yelled at me to move. I was a bit put off and said it really wasn't necessary to yell and we went outside.  Ten mins later the girl's came out to the car and our daughter said she was yelled at when they paid. They paid with cash and the woman who took the money came back to the table and sat down their change- approximately $2-$3. They told her to keep it as a tip. Granted, it wasn't a big tip, but they are young girl's and frankly tipping isn't a requirement. She started scolding them and yelling how they needed to pay 10% tip - she called them imbeciles over and over. They are young girl's and should not have been intimated into leaving a larger tip, and definitely not called imbeciles. What type of restaurant employee calls their customer an imbecile? Our oldest daughter is a server and we get the importance of tipping. However, it's up to the customer on what to tip ( and here there isn't much service) . I didn't see anywhere here that a tip is \"required\". I can tell you our daughter would NEVER yell at a customer for not tipping.  I thought about going back in to complain or call, but know it would have been pointless as the one who yelled at them appears to be the manager. So, instead I leave my review and let people decide. It's not the top dim sum, so why put up with rude behavior. My money will be spent at restaurants where people are kind and appreciative.",

I can't understand how this place got three and a half stars; the only explanation that comes to mind is that Vegas isn't the prime place for Asian food, but I don't think it's that unreasonable for people to have taste buds, much less standards.  Orchids boasts of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that's the source of all its problems. It's near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food is usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here is oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat.   This has been the biggest disappointment yet, given my impression from Yelp. Peeps, please be more aware of what you're eating before you review.",

I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden.   Dont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.  They have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.  If I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?  To put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?",

The two items that stood out for me was the roasted duck and tripe. The roasted duck has the perfect crispiness to it accompanied with the perfect amount of fat. Every piece was greaZy and flavorful. MMMMM MMMMM!!! The lady gave me a hint. If you end up getting two orders of the duck for dim sum, just order a half duck on the regular menu. You'll save $4. EYE LIKE!!! NAAAAAAAAS!!! HOW MUCH!!! The tripe didn't change my life like how the roasted duck did, but the slight bitterness of it had me ordering more.  Good food for sure.  I love to frequent this place. Thanks yallz for serving dim sum all day. ... These guys deserve at least 4.  HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!",

The restaurant is massive and as soon as you are seated the dim sum carts are right there. I recommend trying to get a table close to the kitchen entrance (dim sum 101). The food was hot for the most part and anything my family and I needed it was given to us instantly. Great place to take the family.",

    "text": "Just got back from a *fabulous* lunch at Orchids Garden. Clearly I'm not Asian and for some background I didn't grow up in Cali or anything, so I am no expert in dim sum. I've had it a few times in Houston at various spots, but this was by far the best dim sum I've had.   We had many many types of dumplings. Some with mushrooms, most had some sort of shrimp or pork in there somewhere. Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. One of the surprise favorites was a platter of rolled up \"wide noodles\" (damn I wish I knew the name of them!). They looked like tripe or something icky, but trust me - order them!   So if you're new to dim sum and want to give it a shot, this place is an excellent place to start. Our check came out to $35 for 2 of us, but we got disgusting amounts of food. I'm too embarassed about how much we ate to sit back and tally up how many pieces that must have been!",

    "text": "This is the second time I've ever tried this restaurant. The first time was roughly around 16 years ago when I was small child. I didn't remember much except that we didn't get sick. (Insert drumroll here! )  So I tried it out again with my mother today and I have to say the food was not bad. It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent.  The service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.  There are many other amazing Chinese restaurants as well as Chinese fusion restaurants and Thai restaurants in town but I feel more comfortable eating at. I tried this place because it's a little relieved .1 miles from my house. But I don't think I'll be going here again.",

We ended up meeting up around 4pm after a few got off of work.   Around that time, OG was not very busy, but the dishes were still coming out steaming. The dishes ranged around $2.30-$3.30 and the most expensive were $6.30. Most of the classic dim sum items are on the lower end, but were on the smaller side compared to other places. The flavor of the dishes were good. They had most of the usual selections for dim sum. I did not see any har gow though. By the time we were finished, each person left full on $13.",

We constantly come back simply because of our love for dim sum and only that. Since the first day we ate here, service has always been unreliable. Perhaps 1 out of every 5 visits here, we receive somewhat mediocre service. Every other time, we are faced with rude and dismissive servers, eager to just move through every table and complete their rotation. One server, who clearly had plenty more shumai in her cart, was extremely hesitant to give us more than one order. Shu mai is our family's favorite and we typically order at least 3 bowls. It seems as if every employee there would rather be somewhere else. Even the lady, who seems to be the manager, was on her phone before my brother personally went up to her asking for our check. Our table was right in front of her and we had finished eating atleast 10 minutes prior. The food is good, but we will consider going to another establishment next time. The 2 stars are only for the food. I hope they fix these problems soon.",

    "text": "We had dimsum for dinner on a Saturday night at Orchids Garden. They serve dimsum all day from 10:30am - 10:30pm. Since they don't take reservations, we decided to go at 5:30pm - early enough before it gets too crowded.  Waitresses walk around with carts filled with plates of dimsum, and they stop at each table. You pay per plate by category. As you take plates, the watresses stamp your food bill: A ($2.30) - our favorites are the Steamed BBQ Bun and for dessert: Baked Sweet Cream Bun and Red Bean Sesame Ball. B ($3.10) - our favorites are Shrimp Hargow, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Shrimp Pasted Eggplant (make sure you get the sauce), Pan Fried Chives Dumpling, Shrimp with Rice Noodle, and for dessert: Mango or Coconut Pudding (with sweetened condensed milk.) C ($4.15) - Sugar Cane Shrimp D ($6.15) - Chinese Broccoli, Seaweed Salad, and the Chow Mein.  The standouts are the Chow Mein (even though $6.15 is over-priced for noodles), the Steamed BBQ Bun is the best deal, Pan Fried Chives Dumplings were our favorite, and the best dessert is the Baked Sweet Cream Bun!  Although we love the Seaweed Salad, the portion size is so small, it's not worth $6.15.  Seven of us ate everything we wanted for a total of $82 plus tax. That's a pretty good deal! This is our favorite dimsum place in Vegas!",

Disappointed that they don't have the fried seaweed roll and they don't automaticAlly serve the mustard/chili combo sauce. Towards the middle of our meal, my friend was speechless and immobilized as a small cockroach started walking across the table in front of her, it was small and didn't touch the food, but it's still a cockroach!!

We ordered two combination rice noodle dishes (GOOD), filet mignon with broccoli (NOT GOOD, DON'T ORDER), beef with green bell peppers and onions (TASTY), 2 lobsters - garlic something (GOOD), Pork with orange sauce (So-so), and two other dishes I can't remember.

My parents, my boyfriend and I came here this afternoon for lunch and were seated imediately, the place was busy which is good news. We had fried Sesame balls, baked egg tart, sweet tofu, steamed chibese brocolli, jellyfish,roast duck, xo soy sauce pan fried noodle, etc.  I like the turnip cake that is made with shredded daikon radish and mixed with rice flour and flavored with ham, sausage, shrimp, or other vegetables before being pressed into cakes just melts in your mouth.  And the rice balls-stretchy, chewy texture like Japanese mochi which is essentially identical.They get coated with sesame seeds and deep-fried until they are puffed up and are then piped with a sweet red bean paste.  The baked bbq pork bun was wow my boyfriend says and everything else were delicious.   I noticed the price were cheaper than other dim sum place in town.  The cart was rolling around quick and the service was ok.  We will be back.",

Chicken Feet (4/5) Beef tendon (4/5) Both of these dishes are awesome and taste great.   fried taro puffs my favorite thing (3/5 sometimes when you bite into this it leaves an iodine type smell that i find annoying sometimes)  Now SHUMAI AND HAR-GO ( also my favorites) i rate 2/5 they need some work in this area this is your go to items and they should shine  Tofu Fa( hot tofu sweet dessert or starter ) 4/5 this is pretty good here its perfectly sweet and the tofu is very smooth. the issue i have sometimes at places when they dont execute this dish is that the texture of the tofu is grainy so i tend not to finsih but here i do .  BEST THING ON THE MENU ( Baked Bbq pork Cha Su Bao) the sticky one 5/5 this is my favorite thing here its so tasty and they put this sticky glaze on it to finish the first bite of this dish is awesome and i always tend to order this to go or i stack my table with 3 orders and take the rest home. its a good leftover as well  This place is probably the most reliable as far as time because sometimes you crave dimsum at night and its not available but here you can get it",

Both times with my significant other of which the first encounter we walk in and of course someone was there to greet us and ask how many in our party so we can maybe seated. At which point we were given a three-minute time frame to wait. Now this being our first time at this particular location we were unsure as to how to order or what to expect. So they asked as a question as in would you like dim sum me not knowing what that was we said sure. I wish someone would have told me that they will be pushing around cart asking if we wanted anything on the cart versus offering a menu at the time. Once we got past that awkward encounter everything was wonderful the food was great the service was decent enough, nothing to rant about in regards to anything negative. I would recommend this place for family friends especially if we're going to try something new and something authentic. I thank Orchid Garden so very much with experience and will be a regular there from here on out.",

We come here every time we are in Vegas.  We especially enjoy the Shu Mai, Hargow ( shrimp balls) and the eggplant with shrimp.  My companion raved about the red been sesame balls, I personally did not try them but they look delicious.  As soon as you sit down, there is a cart or two on its' way to start filling you up.    The carts come around frequently and are always being replenished with the goodies they serve. It doesn't take long for you to find your favorite dish on a dim sum cart.    Everything tasted very very fresh and we all enjoyed our meal.  You can tell all of the dishes are made with quality ingredients.   The restaurant is huge but they have the staff to give everyone great service.  They also have space for large parties or groups.

It's opened 24 hours and parking isn't horrible, but can sometimes get packed during weekend afternoons. Sometimes guests are turned off by the aggressive nature of the people handling the carts, but I completely get it, it's their job. I just smile and say \"no thank you\".  The dining room is huge, so even if there is a long wait, the wait isn't so bad. My favorite items are the BBQ pork buns, custard buns for dessert and the fried shrimp dim sum that you can completely engulf in the yummy mayo sauce they have. They do have a regular menu you can order off of too, if dim sum isn't your thing. If anyone has any other good dim sum recommendations in the Vegas area, please let me know :D",

So, with a friend visiting from San Francisco (The land of AMAZING Dim Sum) we decided to try Orchids. Definitely this a favorite for many, it was packed! Although we did not wait long before being seated.  Once seated the food started to come by. The service was good, the dim sum was good. There is not a lot of selection in what comes by, but it was good. I would go back for sure. Maybe choose a bit more slowly to see other options? Because we all know the minute we are done with the meal, the amazing stuff starts to walk by!!  - You know it is True!!! LOL",

    "text": "I came here with my parents and my grandma and aunt and uncle over Thanksgiving weekend. The dim sum here was pretty good quality, especially the baked dishes. The bbq pork bun, the pineapple bun, and the other pastries were fresh. These were probably the freshest tasting baked dim sum goods I had ever had. I don't even know how to describe it, but it was really good. They also had really awesome chicken feet. The chicken feet was my favorite dish especially because after I ate it, I didn't feel sick from all the grease. It was not very greasy. Normally, at dim sum restaurants, the chicken feet is fried heavily and comes out extremely greasy. I normally can't eat more than two at best, but I definitely could eat more. The shiu mai was good too, although it was a little on the tiny side compared to places in LA. It is not that expensive and is definitely a good place for dim sum in Vegas!",

We were both in the mood for trying some tasty dim sum and it sounded like a good idea... until we got here. We grabbed a couple of dishes to start. It doesn't matter what they were cause here is what is important they were all cold, stale, and didn't even appear appetizing. Needless to say, we didn't grab anything else. Oh and the worst part, as soon as I got home I felt stomach sick and had to throw up. That never happens. This place is a disaster.  Please save yourself from food-borne illnesses and paying to eat frankenfood. I would have rather eaten a hundred booger flavored jellybellys. It was that bad.",

The dining area is very large, I was quite surprised. They do Dim Sum all day, which is awesome. The ladies who go around to the tables know what is in each of the dishes too. That's unusual for some of the places I've been.  We ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again.   Great service, amazing sweet & sour chicken & Dim Sum all day! Plus it's 5 minutes it from my house. Gets a good review in my book!",

The food is OK compared to other dim sum places I've been to. The place is pretty clean and very roomy. The service is quick and practical. The wait isn't long (about 5 minute wait) and our party of 10 ended up paying approximately $14 bucks per person! :)   Great deal for all the Chinese food we ate. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in town and need something to fill up my hungover self.   The new years candy (milky strawberry candy) is deeeeelish!

It isn't the best dim sum I've had, but it satisfies me when I crave dim sum. Service ranges from bad to mediocre. One time, a lady was heading toward our table with the cart... but saw a bigger party seated two tables after us, told us to wait and skipped us to go to them, and then came back once she was finished at their table. It's also pretty hard to get them to refill whatever it is you're drinking.  They also don't clean underneath the tables once people are done eating. So if eating at a booth, be sure to NOT look under the table if you don't want to be disgusted.   Prices are what you would find at any other dim sum restaurant.",

The women walking around with the carts of food don't speak English and they definitely don't smile.  We could not decipher from the menu what was what from looking at the cart.  Eventually, we had to ask the Manager to come over, who also spoke very poor English, and walk us through the menu and the items on the cart.  Unless you sat near or in the aisles it was difficult for you see the food choices.  The food was unmemorable.  Dim Sum is traditionally affordable but I found out very quickly that 4 small items added up to $18.00.

Wait: Was actually not bad, waited about 10 minutes during lunch time, for them to set up a table for 4.  Service: 1.The server came to get our drink orders shortly after we sat down. Didn't have to wave anyone down just for tea. 2. Probably due to lunch time, the carts came around but a lot of the food was not available and had to wait until the carts refill. 3. Servers came around frequently to clear empty plates and refill the drinks, which is very good.  Food: *Shumai (pork dumpling) was not of the authentic/traditional flavor, it carries a Western flavor to it. Not to my taste. *XiaoLongBao (Shanghai Dumpling) was OK, a bit too dry. This dish should have soup when biting into it.  ChangFen (Steamed Rice Noodle), was made very well. It was soft and thin, but didn't fall apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. It is not easy to get it to that texture.  They also offer a few dishes that are not served at other dim sum restaurants. I missed eating them! *ShengJianBao (Pan-fried Pork Bun). I haven't been to a place that served this for years! It was delicious, the bun was soft and fluffy, the meat was juicy inside. *BaiTangGao (Rice Cake). Fluffy and not very sweet, just like it should be. It had nice thin layers, whereas other places make it a big chunk.  Will definitely come back another time for lunch!",

Order still not here and the rest of food is so cold. They are very attentive to the  Chinese people behind me.  I will never come back here!!

    "text": "Craving DIM SUM, Hawaiian style? This place is 4 stars for the dim sum and prices but 3 stars for regular Chinese food and the ambience/service.  Dim Sum is pretty good and really cheap compared to some of the Honolulu places. We had 12/15 different dishes and the 4 of us dropped only 12 bucks each, all in. They have both the steamed baskets and small dish plate servings. Ladies roam around the large restaurant over and over again.  After awhile it got annoying, especially the harsh tone used as they yell at you what their cart has.  But they do have the green bottle soy sauce(low sodium)!  Of course, it could have been the lack of sleep on our part.  But I figure that if you say \"no, thank you - no need gin dui\" twice, you do not need to hear \"u like gin due?!?!\" over and over again repeatedly.   There were not that many tables at an early lunch so I was hoping they would remember that our table does not want gin dui!   oh well.  I bring sign next time - \"NO GIN DUI HERE\".  Some of my buddies say that in a Dim Sum place you do not need to respond to every call out to your table.  So, is it really OK to just ignore the cart aunties?  I was taught to try to respond to every request to you with \"yes, please, or no thank you\".  I guess I need to learn how to just ignore the cart aunties!  Big  corner sign and Big restaurant with good number of locals getting dim sum in and take out. Overall, very filling cheap dim sum lunch.  Just get some sleep before going as you will need patience with the roaming aunties with carts!  Oh well - time to get back on the HA horse and fly back to Hawaii.  Aloha.",

It took just a few minutes for them to ask us what we wanted to drink and bring us some utensils to use for our food.   We were sat where not a lot of people were at first so the dim sum carts passed us by a few times before actually coming to us. I can't remember the first thing we got because the lady said it in Chinese and kinda looked at us and expected us to know what it was. All I got from what she said was shrimp and wonton so we got one of those and two shumai baskets. We also later got noodles and Chinese broccoli. We thought the shrimp was delicious so choose to actually get another one of those and even had a few left overs in the end.   Overall, everything was tasty. It did take quite some time for someone to come back in the end to check on us so we could get a box and the check though. Our experience was good and the restaurant was clean and has an Asian theme to it.",

Carts are pushed around with different food items, your table will be approached, you pick what you want (don't be shy to ask, they'll tell you!) and you are tallied with a stamp card until you are ready to pay!   Okay. Yes, people complain about the aggressive asian women pushing the carts, or the fact that it doesn't compare to California dim sum or blah blah blah... BUT! This place has consistently good food, has all-day dim sum and has a ton of seating -- so the wait is never bad even if they're slammed. Did I mention their lunch time prices are crazy worth it?!   MUST TRY: - Pork siu mai (pork dumpling) - Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumpling) - Shark fin dumpling - Sugar cane shrimp ball - Fried shrimp ball  - Shrimp wonton (fried, served with sweet mayo) - Bola bao (baked sweet egg custard filled bun) - Spinach dumping (I've heard this also referred to as meatballs?) - Crab claw - Chicken wings (call me crazy but I feel like these taste like nutella...) - Steamed chicken feet (I am not a personal fan of this, but find this is very popular among almost everyone I have dim sum with haha)  *I always get this with a small side of white rice. And their hot tea! :)",

Despite the parking lot being packed we were immediately seating, and had our drinks and hot tea within five minutes and within ten minutes we had the following on our table: pork shiu mai, fried shrimp balls (2 different kinds) calamari, Chinese broccoli, chow mein, beef spare ribs, rice and, sweet cream buns, totaling $61. We had three orders of shiu mai  and when we left we were kicking ourselves for not getting a few more pots to take to go with us, they're the perfect comfort food and my hangover dissipated immediately. The calamari is a must try too, it's was perfectly crispy and sooo tender, the shrimp balls with the shredded wonton is super juicy and doesn't taste like ground shrimp mushed together and other one oozes little shrimps when you bite into it. The sweet cream buns were filled with egg custard and were nice and soft and the spare ribs fall off the bone. We'll definitely be back again and again",

I really come here for their variety of dim sum.  Several ladies push around carts of steaming dumplings to small plates of vegetables and shumai to name a few. My favorites are the har gow, steamed greens and shrimp pops. There is also desserts available distinguished with sweet glazes and sweet sticky rice cakes.   My preferences are very simple...house pan fried noodles loaded with bok choy, mushrooms, greens and chicken, salty pork chops that compliment either steamed white rice or combination fried rice and pretty much any steamed vegetable.  So yummy you won't even feel like you over did it as expected when eating Chinese food.  The complementary oolong tea is a nice drink during the meal as well as a great finisher.   Also, their Thai iced tea is large, tall and flavorful not watered down with too much ice. It goes great with just about everything they serve.   One thing is for sure, the prices are reasonable and it's big enough to accomadate a large head count.  Huge parking lot at the front and can get really crowded on the weekends during brunch.  Plan to arrive early to beat the wait list.",

    "text": "The good thing about Orchids Garden is that they serve dim sum all day. The food is pretty good but I can't say it's my favorite place for dim sum.  What's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. I always get Chinese broccoli, shumai, BBQ pork buns, stir-fried noodles, shrimp wontons, shrimp balls, minced meat balls, sesame balls...and whatever balls they have. These are my favorites and what I would normally get at any restaurant that serves dim sum. Their shrimp wontons aren't the best.   Now, what really turns me off with this place is that they nuke their food in the microwave. I love roast pork and that's just one of the best examples of food they microwave. The meat is warm but the skin gets chewy, no crisp and just unenjoyable.  The key to a good Chinese restaurant is the service. If the servers speak good English and are friendly, go somewhere else!",

    "text": "I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.  What continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.  The food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.  Group A ($2.40) Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Pan Fried Daikon Cake Deep Fried Meat Ball  Group B ($3.20) Baked BBQ Pork Bun Steamed Pork Spareribs Steamed Chicken Feet Baked Sweet Cream Bun Steamed Pork Shiu Mai Steamed Shrimp Dumpling Shrimp Har Gow Pork Porridge Steamed Beef Ball Bean Curd Skin Roll Shrimp Pasted Eggplant Baked Egg Tart Steamed Soup Dumpling Mushroom Shiu Mai Chiu-Chow Style Dumpling  Group C ($4.25) Fried Shrimp Ball Fried Shrimp Puff Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf Shrimp Rice Noodle Beef Rice Noodle  Group D ($6.25) Chinese Broccoli  Pan Fried XO Noodle  I like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.  I don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture.   We spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces.",

The rice cake (aka honeycomb cake) is the closest fix I can get for my 808nostalgia. Nothing comes close in this state to finding the kind of rice cakes we get back in HI.   I know, I know...we aren't in HI. So that's why this will make-do. The rice cake comes in 3 thin slices for...darn, I don't ever remember the price because I do one of those order and just pay (don't worry...it's not a bad habit I practice). But I think it's in the dollar area.   Their Manapua (char siu bao) comes in 3 pcs as well. It's dimsum so you can't expect a huge stuffing. But they're pretty good. Their baked Manapua is drizzled in honey. Sooo good! I never thought Manapua and honey could work so well together--it does.   We always order to-go just to have something to stuff our mouths in on our drive. I don't really care for dimsum here because they usually offer items I'm allergic to or am not interested in eating. I end up just eating manapua, their chow mein, and rice cake. Then I don't think of ordering an ala carte entree because if I'm at a dimsum, despite my food aversion, I want to try to experience it the most I can.   So cart lady, keep wheeling in those manapuas  and rice cakes, please.",

We arrived about noon and seated rather quickly despite the whole dining room being full of people.  The dim sum quality was a bit disappointing for Vegas standard.  Shu Mai was very gross with just pork inside.  Rice Rolls were ok.  Fruit Tart and Coconut Buns were conceptually interesting. Chicken Feets were too saucy. Xiaolongbao, cannot expect much from non-Shanghainese joint.  Everything else was at par.  The dim sum ladies were very aggressive in selling their items, almost like a 5 minutes repeating cycle asking to get something without realizing our table was already full.  Orchid Garden was ok neighborhood dim sum joint, and I suppose the locals would visit here more often due to the logistic and distance away the tourist crowd near the Strip.",

    "text": "2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 058/100  Solid dim sum restaurant in Vegas!  My boyfriend wanted to get dim sum while we in Vegas, so we did a little Yelping and found this to be one of the better places in the area. NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.  We came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!  I love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes.   This place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:  ha/har gow siu mai wu gok cha siu bao (baked + steamed) cheong fan lo baak gou fung zao daan taat jin deui do fu fa lai wong bau  We got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there!   I also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!  Overall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!",

Selection of food was pretty good, disappointed a few of the traditional dim sum plates were not brought around but I guess every dim sum restaurant is slightly different.

    "text": "I grew up and lived in Los Angeles most of my life, so when it comes to Dim Sum, I admit to being a bit spoiled. For me, the bar has been set quite high by the variety and quality of Dim Sum available just east of LA.  Because of that and because I am realistic about living in a relatively provincial town compared to Los Angeles, I am willing to judge accordingly and be less critical.   I have been to Orchid's Garden many times and it's usually passable Dim Sum. I've never walked out of there thinking, \"Wow, that was kick ass\".  That said, I was just glad that at least I could get some Dim Sum here in Las Vegas, albeit mediocre.    I don't like writing bad reviews of restaurants, but I'm afraid that my last visit necessitates some serious venting. I actually left this dump feeling pissed off. There is almost nothing worse than seriously craving good Chinese food then having an absolutely crappy meal. In a way, it's like having sex and ending with a mistimed lackluster orgasm.    It was partially my fault for having the temerity of eating at 4:30 in the afternoon. The place was fairly empty and only one sad lukewarm cart was being wheeled about.  Dim Sum is best when a place is overflowing with ravenous customers and hot steaming carts are careening about at the hands of hostile Chinese women who recoil at the thought of serving Gringos.  Oh, wait, I take that back. They were a little rancorous.  Everything we picked from the cart was room temperature at best. The selection was old, oily and diminutive.  With a little imagination, one might wonder if this is what Dim Sum is like when served in socialist Venezuela where people engage in small skirmishes just to get a loaf of bread.    When I finally flagged down the waitress to get our check, I actually got very Gordon Ramsey on her and said, \"You should be embarrassed to serve crap like that.\" My bitchy comment was returned with a blank, couldn't-give-a-shit, stare.   Four of us in my party vowed to never go back. It was simply terrible. What a shame. Fortunately none of us got sick.",

This place is huge and gets packed between the hours of 9am-2pm crazy busy. If you've never experienced Dim sum its a great experience. Asian ladies pushing around metal carts to each table with asking \"what chu want wha chu want\" HAHA sorry I must make fun of my people. Its a super loud place so be prepared to scream across your table (okay maybe I over exaggerated that just a bit). Well like I said decent, nothing really to comment about this place other than it serves dim sum all day. That's pretty much the only good thing about this place.

We Stop by a Chinese place and ask someone for information. He recommend Orchids Garden, so we give it a try..... It was about 1pm and the place was pretty full of people but we still got a table with no wait... Most worker are women, the only thing was I can't really tell who's waitress, who's the lady pushing the cart...cos they all pretty much look like work with everything....   We were so hungry and need to meet someone in an hour include 15 to 20 mins driving time, so we just want to eat and go.... Well, there dim sum was ok, a little better then Chang's... but it also cold... and the Har Gaw (steam shrimp dumpling) had hard skin, so as the Fun Gou (other white skin steam dumpling). What's up with these place... can't keep up the temperature.... Even you have good food, the temperature is most importance too. Yes is hard to keep dim sum on the right temp, but you still have to find a way to deal with it. \"Esply when a place SERVE DIM SUM FOR ALL DAY.\"    Anyway, we still like to go back and try again. Next time if the food is cold,... oh ya I'll talk to them about that problem...",

Which is fine, since I'm used to it by now, but my last experience here made me never want to come back.  I decided to come here one day craving Dim Sum. It was the closest location to my school so I decided to pay Orchid Garden a visit. I went in, glad to see there was no line, made I contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before I was seated. I understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers, but I'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat me.  Once I was seated, I wanted ordered my usual Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chow Fun, and Shrimp balls; however, after being served cold shrimp balls and Siu Mai, I couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving. The 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if \"everything is okay\" or if there's \"anything I need..\" So I helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter, asked for the check, left no tip and walked out.  I highly recommend eating at Cathay or Chang's for Dim Sum. They are alot friendlier and the food is much better.",

It's supposed to be dim sum all day long, BUT the secret to their success is to warm up the food sitting in the carts all day long.. in the microwave.  It is so apparent & obvious by the texture of the food, taste and smell.  However, I was dismayed to learn that when you actually order from the menu....it's not that bad. They do have really good egg fu yung, so an extra star for the item ordered off the menu.",

They did not have any beef cheung fun on Monday which was utterly disappointing. Their beef balls were excellent though and their BBQ buns ok, though a bit fatty. Their lo mei gai rice wrapped in lotus lee was very good. Bathrooms are actually really nice and modern which was a real surprise. Glad they serve dim sum all day long as I will be back!",

I went on a weekday, so there was no wait... not sure if it holds the same on a weekend.  The service is good and the ladies pushing the carts around are very accommodating.  The clientele is very mixed so they can all speak basic English and can give general descriptions of the dim sum if needed.  The food is good, but I wasn't a fan of the turnip cake (lo bak go) or juicy dumplings (xiao long bao).  These dishes can definitely be skipped.  I thought it was a bit pricey for dim sum, but then again I am used to the prices in the SGV where all the dishes are the same price and aren't separated by size.",

A couple really good things; 1) they serve dim sum all day not just morning/lunch time; you can get chow mein off the cart in individual sizes vs. having to order a huge plate.  Cart service was pretty quick and came by often, wait service was slow.  Paid $71 plus tip for 7 people.  When in Vegas again, I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "On the quest to find decent dim sum in the desert, Orchids Garden was my next try.  They get major points for constantly having carts of food roll by.  The only problem was that the selection was to the minimum.  I would get all excited every time I see a cart, only to discover each lady had the same exact thing as the lady before her.  Bummer.    I give them major points for having Shanghai dumplings.  However, they were horrendous!  The skin was unusually thick and you'll never find me ordering that here again.  They also had the very special Shark Fin Dumpling Soup (Goon Tong Gow,  to fill with liquid, soup, dumpling) that you have to special order.  It comes with red vinegar and ginger slices for you to dump into the soup.  Yes, major props for having it, but it didn't taste that great either.  And instead of shark fin, they had glass noodles instead!  Their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings were decent.  Their chicken feet in black bean sauce was flavorful.  Their bean curd wrapped seafood thing was okay, some of it over steamed though.  The Chinese broccoli was slippery as heck and the shrimp rice noodle was decent too.  The tricky thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill, we noticed different stuff coming out!  I saw the Pineapple Bun and inquired if there was yellow egg custard in it, and the lady confirmed there was!  Since discovering this yummy bun only recently, I had to get some.  And it was oh so good, and piping hot too!  (It's the marriage of the Bolo Bao and the Nai Wong Bao!)    I only had the small egg custard tarts and this other fruit tart that I wouldn't usually see in a dim sum restaurant for dessert.  They did have the soft tofu, but the lady scooping it caught too much water in there, drowning out the syrupy taste.  Overall, Orchids Garden was a decent place for dim sum on a Saturday morning.  It's a huge place with lots of Chinese (ethnic Chinese, as I could hear Cantonese being spoken everywhere) and non-Chinese customers dining here.  I like that you can see non-Chinese families dining here as it can often be intimidating at these huge dim sum operations.    And the prices were pretty decent too. With a party of four, it came out to about $65 total, and we definitely stuffed ourselves pretty good too.  Until I find another place better, you'll find me here again.  The wait was minimal too. And there's parking in the back as well!  Update: 01/03/07 - I've been back twice already since this review!  And it's not because the food is so fabulous, but I have yet to find a better one.  You can easily fit 14 people at a table with minimal wait too!  And their Pineapple Egg Custard buns are so worthy waiting for!  Get them while they are hot and take them all if you can!  They are THAT good.  Update: 11/05/07 - Went back yesterday for dim sum.  Their chicken's feet was pretty good, and the deep fried calamari was a surprise hit too.  The BF really like the roasted pork that came with pickled veggies.  Their chive and shrimp dumpling is good when it's hot, and thank goodness the Shanghai dumplings never came out since I forgot our bad experience with it the first time!  The pineapple egg custard bun was present, but not quite as good when it's not piping hot.  So, only get it when it's hot hot hot!",

As I predicted, all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (e.g. har gao, char siu bao, etc.). If you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like, don't like yourself very much, or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.",

The place was packed and the carts rolled around and soon we had bbq pork buns on the table along with other things. Everything was good. I mean it's not San Francisco good, but out of all the places we've been to in Vegas, this one is better than the rest.  By the time we finished, the crowd was so big it was hard to get out the door.

    "text": "We got into Vegas very early and so we decided to get some dim sum for breakfast. Though this place is a bit further away from the Strip, it was worth it!!   This place was packed, plus a lot of customers were Chinese. Which to me means one thing, this place doesn't suck. We sat down, and instantly the carts were roaming around our table. There were a great variety of dim sum and it was pretty good. We also had great service. Our tea pot was always full and our water cups were never empty.   Overall, I would definitely come back for dim sum. The food was good, service was great, and price was affordable.   P.S. - I went to Ping Pang Pong a few days later, and that place sucked balls (service and food is horrible). That place can not be comparable to Orchids Garden. Orchids is 10 times better IMO.",

I would recommend the calamari, it wasn't too crunchy which I liked.    The servers were more polite than usual for a chinese dim sum restaurant and every time we asked for a certain item not on that person's cart they would try to grab the attention of the person pushing the cart with the food we wanted.   The only negative was that their bathrooms weren't so great. Not too clean, toilet paper on the floor and such.",

But this place seems to be where the local older Chinese people come to.  The best dim sum, hands down I've had, was in Vancouver, Canada . But I digress.  This place overall is probably one of the best in town. It's clean (I give high marks for this-nothing kills an appetite like a dirty joint), the selection is varied, and some dishes like the bok choy are delicious.  I would definitely recommend coming here to try it out for yourself.",

I guess we were seated in the \"other\" room, and not the main dining area. Oh well! The only good thing I ate (and was WARM!) was the pineapple buns. They were pretty good. Theresa B. and me had to get another tray.  The total wasn't as bad as we thought. We had about 20 dim sum plates, and it cost us about $13 each for the 4 of us (including tip and tax).   I actually like Chang's a lot better than this...",

You can come in for a quick nosh or stay for hours, and the staff treats you very well. I have been there about 5 times so far, and it hasnt changed. Virtually never a wait for seating (unlike Cathay House and the others).   They always have a nice selection of carts with both the usual (shu mai, siopao, shrimp balls) and unusual items of interest (tripe, chicken feet). As in all Dim Sum eateries, be prepared to wait if you have a favorite. Otherwise, just pickup your ticket and go searching. This is actually ok behaviour there and will quicken your time waiting.",

The food here is mostly seafood, so if you aren't a big fan of seafood then i would definately not recommend this place. The dim sum is probably one of the better food that they offer. And i noticed the dim sum carts were unattended most of the time i was there. The service is standard and it would be great if you speak Chinese. Otherwise, i sure hope you have your ways of getting their attention.",

But that is a good sign so no complaints there.  They just needed more bench and chairs for the older folks so they can sit while they wait.    The dim sum is fresh, warm and you can even order what you do not see.  Go before the busy time so you don't wait long.   My fave there is the calamari.  I love the egg pie, the crust is soooo flaky and yumms.     This place was highly recommended to me ....I highly recommend it to everyone.....!",

    "text": "3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.  Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM. Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.  We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).  Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \"coming right out\" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.  We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings.",

Visited Vegas for independence weekend (2017) and after consuming buffets after buffets, the hubby and I wanted to venture outside of the strip. Found this little gem on yelp and decided to give it a try! We are avid dim sum eaters and seem to draw interest in trying a new place every time we travel outta town.   From the exterior, this place is nothing special. Typical mom and pop restaurant that's stuck in ancient Asian decor. We were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was and was seated right away. The manager (we think that's who it was) took our drink order and carts of food just started rolling our way.   Let me tell you, everything was DELISH. We had 2 orders of shrimp/crab fried balls, 1 order of shrimp hakkou(?), 1 order of chicken feet, 2 orders of rolled pan fried noodles, 1 order of Chinese broccoli, 1 order for pork bbq buns, 1 order of egg custard cupcakes, 1 order of steamed cream buns and 1 order shrimp rice noodles. Our tab was just under $60. Not bad as we walked away with our bellies full and a great experience.   Customer service was indeed slow however, the manager lady who watched over our section was very attentive when called upon.   Overall, if we are ever in Vegas again, we will definitely make this place a tradition to stop by!",

Moving on I had some of the things on the cart like fried noodle and pork bun, not a fan of shrimp, which seemed like most of the stuffing in the items in the carts like the fried noodle has shrimp stuffing, it was good good but couldn't finish it since I don't like sea food the pork bun though that was the best thing I ate for dinner, I would only come back here for that bun, bill came out to be 81$$$ Like I wanted to die, because customer service felt rushed except for the fact they tried to help us sending a translator, the food was gross, like the courses and way over priced should've just gotten ramen tonight I sooooo regret it, sorry to be so negative, but just ew I'm glad they had those pork buns if I go again I would just go for the buns once again no other food items or anything like that, also once inside place looks pretty big but there's not that many customers so makes it look old and dead.",

Still one of the better dim sum places to eat at if your in vegas",

We used to come because we like the food but now it's a pleasant experience with better service. Make sure to not let them stamp your card before bringing out your food.. Some waiters/waitresses will try to stamp it twice and charge you double!  There's always a good variety of food and they will make any item on the menu by request if it is not available on the carts. Try the pineapple buns for dessert!   They're de-lish!",

    "text": "My aunt decided to try this place after hearing it was really good from her friends. For me, the overall experience was kinda just OK. The place seemed a bit dated, but at least the furniture wasn't ripped or tables that were lopsided like other places I've been to. The quality of the food is like a 3 1/2 stars. There definitely are some other joints here in Vegas that have dim sum and are better overall in my opinion. High recommendations for this place maybe because they serve dim sum all day rather than just for brunch/lunch like other places?  We always get the pan fried combination noodles when coming to a dim sum place, bao (pork bun) and siomai (dumpling). Today my sister ordered the crab ball which is basically crab meat balled and fried. It was pretty good actually, and they ask if you want the mayo dipping sauce to go along with it. My advice, ask for a couple spoon scoop fills if you like mayo or creamy dipping sauces so you'll have enough for 3 of the shrimp balls. Really does do the shrimp and crab balls justice. This place wasn't outstanding, and it wasn't bad either. I guess it's what you expect at a dim sum place. I know I'll be back here if I'm in town with family again.",

I'm definitely going back to taste the other treats.  I also noticed a lot of buns rolling away. Next time... I can understand comments of bad service but luckily our group did not experience it. They were consistently pleasant and attentive. The service was quick, rolling carts kept coming with all these delicious treats. Dim sum all day!",

This would be beneficial if you're on a timed lunch break, but if you're having a leisurely lunch with your peers, just wait until the next circle around.   Is this the best, perfect dim sum? No. Is it conveniently located with quick, hot servings? Yes.  It would be great if they had someone to truly evaluate each option and work on curating a delicious, perfect version, but sometimes your baked bun is going to be a little dry or your steamed dumpling is going to have too many peanuts.",

Service sucks and food is great. BUT!!!! what made me decide to leave a review was not how I was treated, but how one of their workers were treated. I'm guessing the ladies who call the shots is the one wearing the peach colored shirts, and the Mexican lady working there wearing purple was the busser. As the older Mexican lady was cleaning up the table next to us, the Peach shirt lady with a pony tail and glasses brought another party to be seated. She proceeded to yell at the older Mexican lady to sweep faster and hurry up. Threw a rag at her, and then literally DHOVED her out of the way so the family could be seated, as she seated them, I glared at her and said that's fucked up. She looked at me and snobbery me, went to her other peach colored shirt ladies, said something to them and they all looked back at me. From that point on, they never came back to serve our table. The just stood at the cash register watching me. So I gave the older Mexican lady a 100.00 tip for being awesome, and paid for my bill with every coin in my bag and crumpled torn dollar bills I had.",

This has nothing to do with caloric value or health preferences, I'm not that kind of girl. I just feel that dim sum taste amazing when steamed, I really wanted this place to have more creative options, I would have spent more money that way. Overall the options they had were really good. The soup dumpling is soooooo good. We went with friends so we had quite the variety, just wish there was more but like I said, I'll be coming back so they are clearly doing something right.",

The chive dumplings are different than any other dumplings that I have had and are really tasty, even if you don't love chives normally. The egg pastry has a great filling to it that isn't too sweet and is perfect for an after meal treat.   The salt and pepper lobster dish is a good splurge dish too! The lobster is prepared well and the seasoning isn't too salty but isn't too bland either.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is just like any other dim sum place. It's a great place for families. The staff and service is great too!",

    "text": "Though many will contest that there is \"no good Dim Sum in Las Vegas\" that notion seems largely rooted in folks from Southern California who grew up less than an hour from the San Gabriel Valley, the vast majority of natives and those born east of the Mississippi generally easier to please as Dim Sum did not even exist in their home town, nor did any Chinese Restaurant differentiating Szechuan from Cantonese.  Usually restricting the search for such Food to Spring Mountain Road, the rich diversity of Asian eateries in a three-mile stretch of pavement rivaling many American Chinatowns in terms of number but with more diversity, it was instead for a friend's birthday that the car was navigated to the corner of Sahara and Lindell, Orchids Garden gleaming in neon just as it has for over fifteen years.  Known as one of the few locations in town for all-day Dim Sum plus traditional Cantonese Cuisine, the same ownership and servers in place for several years ensuring a better service experience than most, it was just prior to 6:30pm that six guests entered the space prior to several others, a total of three tables with 10+ persons each sitting in celebration as silver carts navigated the premises.  Clean in terms of decor and populated by a largely Asian clientele, both good signs as are the well-maintained Fish tank and restrooms, it was less than five minutes after taking a seat that Water arrived and Tea was offered, the former only filled on request and often running empty though the staff did a good job of making certain that Tea Pots were filled regularly.  Sticking to Dim Sum for the evening, a truncated version of the daytime collection offered  but unfortunately already sold out of a few selections, it was as friends were still trickling in that Dinner began with steamed selections, the Shark Fin Dumplings named after their shape rather than contents an early highlight as were whole Fried Shrimp to follow while the Bone-in Duck was unfortunately not only limp on the surface, but more pricey than the portion should be for eight dollars.  Difficult to say whether Orchids Garden uses previously frozen Dim Sum or makes the items fresh on-site, likely a mixture of both given the homogeneity of certain items and odd consistency of their Shrimp Paste, it was after watching everyone at the table pass on Sticky Rice in a Lotus Leaf that a bundle was taken, the random bits of Pork ranging from ground to slices of Sausage actually quite good while both the Bell Pepper and Eggplant were not as a result of the gelatinous Paste.  Finding the Sugarcane Shrimp and Crab Claws virtually indistinguishable despite a $3.54 price difference, ten grams of Snow Crab completely lost at the center of the fried ball, those looking for something better would be well advised to order a few plates of Shrimp Balls covered with crispy Phyllo at three for the price of two, the Pan Fried Chive Dumpling also packed with Shrimp and better than its steamed counterpart, as well.  Never really understanding the point of Vegetables at Dim Sum, though every person of Asian ancestry seems to prioritize String Beans or Broccoli as part of the experience, both options at Orchids Garden were good despite the former being a little flaccid, an issue also noted in the skin of roast Pork that the waitress warned would not be crispy but someone opted to order anyway.  Falling short again with Pork Spareribs, the majority of each piece Bone and the rest of it stringy, those looking for Noodles on Orchids Garden's menu would do well to pass on flavorless Chow Mein and instead request pan-fried Rice Noodles in X.O. Sauce that is funky but not too hot and thus well suited for those with limited spice tolerance.  Rounding out the savories with fried Calamari and Smelt plus steamed Buns containing BBQ Pork plus Sausage, both of the latter plus Custard Buns rousing suspicion that frozen Dim Sum is being used based on their consistency, it was in sweet selections that the experience concluded, both styles of Sesame Balls sticky and good with a lot of filling while Mochi and Mango Pudding were fine, the later served complimentary with a candle.  **1/2:  While it may indeed be True that Las Vegas lacks world-class Dim Sum outside of holiday events at Jasmine and Wing Lei those looking for their fix can still fare well by ordering selectively at a place like Orchids Garden, though dollar-for-dollar better experiences can be found at Chang's or KJ.",

We arrived around 11 and the place was pretty much full but we were seated immediately. The food arrives on many carts. Some with hot steamed varieties, others carts have veggies, crab claws, noodles, baked pork buns, and conge(soup). All delicious. The service staff are everywhere and bring you tea, drinks and also clear your table as you finish each dish. The prices aren't bad. Pretty comparable to other cities for Dim Sum. We were stuffed and the bill for 5 came to around $72. The food keeps coming and coming and quickly. Non stop. I would have given the restaurant 5 stars but it's very noisy. That's the way it is in these types of restaurants. Great place!",

Orchids Gardens have both. They will come around and force their food on you. Every cart claims to  have the best food. And every cart does have great Sum Sum. Some of my favorites are the crispy pork balls and the stuffed eggplant.  Keep in mind their portions are on the small side.",

Our organizer went ahead and ordered for the two tables that we occupied. As a result, I don't know the names of the dishes we had, but it was a pretty good spread. There was fried whole fish, some sort of century egg stew, baby bok choy, fried chicken, pork in peking sauce (I think), walnut shrimp, a sampler plate containing things like jellyfish and tongue, and probably a couple more dishes. Everything was pretty good overall, but nothing was amazing. The Chinese people in our group had some gripes. For example, the baby bok choy was really regular bok choy. Also, one of the sizzling dishes originally came out on a regular plate. They then took it back and pretty much just re-served it on a sizzling plate. Finally, they didn't have the dessert that our group was hoping for. Instead, we just got a plate of oranges.  The restaurant is pretty large by Vegas standards. It seems to be in a weird and isolated location though. I'm not sure if I'd ever return, but I like the fact that they serve Dim Sum all day. That could be worth trying some day.",

The fact that this place serves dim sum all day is a bonus.  We got there at around 8 pm. The place had a decent amount of patrons, but had plenty of free tables. We got our usual dim sum staples of pork siu mai, shrimp balls, and miscellaneous dumplings. We also ordered Sesame Chicken and Hong Kong-style Noodles with Seafood.  The dim sum was pretty good considering it was in the evening. The sui mai was soft and pretty juicy. The shrimp balls were big and tasted great with the sweet mayo.  And I cannot recommend soy sauce mixed with some chili oil enough!  The sesame chicken wasn't anything special. Good but nothing noteworthy. The Hong Kong-style noodles were great, though. More noodles and the sauce wasn't bland like at other places.  The servers were also decently friendly, got us water, and speak English. Additionally, none of them mistook me for being Chinese! It was probably because my parents were with me and they look more non-Chinese than I.  This is the first time we ate here. Thanks to my friends for recommending this place. I'm adding Orchids Garden to my list of go-to Chinese sit down restaurants.",

    "text": "I came here with my boyfriend and his friend (and friend's wife). Being Chinese, from NJ, and having spent a good amount of time having dim sum in Chinatown, NY or in Queens, I thought it was pretty good. We had a lot of the familiar dishes -- ha gow , loh bok goh, cha siu bao, siu mai (steamed shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, steamed pork buns, pork dumplings respectively)-- as well as others that I didn't know (and unfortunately, I don't remember what they were). I thought they were decent.  We also had dau fu fa (it's basically tofu with sweet syrup) except that I never had it the way this place served it: hot and with ginger-flavored syrup. Maybe it's not even called a syrup; it's waterier than what I'm used to. It was good, but I prefer it the way I've always gotten it in Chinatown, NY -- cold and just with the plain sweet syrup. Their tofu was also already broken down.  When my parents got us this snack (from here, I believe: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/fong-inn-too-new-york\">yelp.com/biz/fong-inn-to...</a>), it was whole, in a deli pint container because we usually got them to go. It came with a few disposable condiment containers full of syrup. We sliced up the tofu ourselves and enjoyed it cold.  One thing I thought was weird was that they didn't have any oyster sauce  (ho yau). What Chinese establishment doesn't carry oyster sauce?! When you order loh bok goh in NY, you get oyster sauce with it. They said they didn't have any, but they offered to give me hoisin instead. I said okay, I'll try it. I was reluctant to eat it that way, but I dabbed a bit on the first piece, tasted it, and found that my expectations for this new combination were correct -- it was gross. I finished off that piece and ate the other two plain. Maybe next time I go, I should bring my own little container of oyster sauce so I can enjoy the loh bok goh way I always have.  Other than that, a good experience. I may try Ping Pang Pong someday. Like someone mentioned in a review for there, the name didn't seem to indicate authentic dim sum was served, but that reviewer said s/he was proven wrong.  ..Bah, so mind boggling how a dim sum restaurant doesn't have ho yau. It's sacrilegious.  Man, I really miss being at home.",

The food was good but it being dim sum, sometimes it freshly made and some if it was probably a few hours old and cold by the time it got to us. Went there early afternoon on a Saturday I think and it was fairly empty and they didn't have as many runners and food going around so it took a while for us to get a decent amount of food on our table. I don't know when their prime hours are but it's probably better if you go sometime around there where they're expecting to have a lot of people, thus more food being prepared and it being more fresh. I'd definitely go there again.  Had two tvs but what they were airing was completely random. The big screen had a soccer game going on and there's another screen up front by the waiting area and that was airing Entertainment Tonight or something.",

We waited for the dim sum cart to come around and it wasn't that quick as everyone say. We will try this place again when we crave for it!",

This was a great experience for me and I'm glad this place became my first. Dim Sum here is yummy I love the shrimp dim sum, I'm not much of sho mai fan, but from the looks of everyone else that had it, it seemed like it was good. What I found to be very delicious was the shrimp wontons! Those were delicious. Now because of this place I'm going to hunt down a dim sum place in the Bay Area similar to this. There was more on the menu/food cart that we didn't try, but everything we did try was yummmmy!  When I come back I'll be sure to stop by here again.",

If you don't see what you want on the cart, just ask for it and one of the ladies can help you out.  We usually eat:  char siu baos (steamed for me, baked for my dad), har gow, siu mai, XO mein, stuffed peppers, chicken feet for my parents, egg tartlettes and others.  The dan tat/egg tarts have gotten really small.  Before, they used to be around 3 inches in size, now, they're just bite sized.  Everything else was fresh from the kitchen and before we knew it, we were really stuffed.  The key here is to get there before noon, preferably between 11 and 1130 to beat the crowds and avoid the wait.",

A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck.   Pros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)    Cons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time.",

The dining room feels a little uneasy as all the servers hardly speak a lick of English and they're all always staring and laughing and whatnot. I love their shrimp and crab claw fried balls but you're better off going with the shrimp ones as they're cheaper and taste the same. The shumai and steamed bbq buns are tasty. The fried noodles they have on the cart on a small side plate are tasty but WAY OVERPRICED! The dim sum cart ladies are pretty annoying and can easily ruin your dining experience. You tell them no after no after no and they still keep bugging!  I like to get my food to go.  The white sticky rice cake is pretty good!",

Yes it's Chinese restaurant and what will I expect right?, and No, I am not stereotyping all Chinese restaurants, but this particular one for sure is the worst and beats all the stereotypical Chinese joints! Not just the language barrier but gees, the stinky attitude, the napkins that I requested since I sat down over an hour ago, the response I am getting. Now how the hell do you expect people to keep coming back here? Or Write a positive review? For the last 8 years I've been dining here, I will not be coming back here again!!! They probably don't even have a green card? Just saying... Be careful! I caught them adding items that I never ordered and receipts are in Chinese writing!

Last nite, we went for dinner, NOT DIM SUM as dim sum is only for breakfast and lunch in the Chinese custom. Were we ever so disappointed.   There were three of us and we ordered two of their specials:  Pan Fried Seabass -- fishy taste, no flavor, unappetizing look. A total failure. Grade F.  Filet Mignon with asparagus - strange flavor, filet is too fatty. Grade C- The third dish is a tofu dish with seafood. What they mean by seafood is octopus. Minimal taste. Grade D+.   Service is disappointing, even for Chinese restaurant standard.   Very disappointing meal. Definitely not a place for dinner. We will not be back for dinner again.",

There is a steamed cart, fried cart, starch cart, sweets, and buns.   You get a card and the things on each cart have a different price depending on the cart. When you get an item, the lady will put a stamp on your card. They add up the stamps and that is your food cost.  Be careful grabbing too much. The items have between 1-4 and cost over $2-$6 each, so that quickly adds up. They also have a normal menu.  I've been eating dim sum since I was a good and all of their dishes are good.  Nothing is necessarily great, but definitely good.  I would say definitely try to go during peak hours because the food is more fresh.  Most of the items are different forms of dumplings.   They also have fried shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and other things aside from the dumings.  Try the fried stuff. Try the stuff with chili sauce, try the stuff with their mayo.  The cashier girl is super rude. She never says hi, thank you, or smiles.  I prefer this place over Cathay house because their servers don't skip tables!",

We came around 9 or 10pm on a Sunday and it was great because they serve dim sum on carts all day. They were missing some of the dishes we wanted, but I expect that's because it was so late at night. The turnip fried cakes and the fried taro had to be ordered and made so it took about 20 minutes to receive those. We ordered shumai, shrimp balls (they're the same if on sugar cane or the crab claw), and two orders of chicken feet. All in all, including tea, it came out to be $40 for 3 people.",

The restaurant is very clean, bright, huge yet very attentive. The quality and selection of Dim Sum really exceeded our expectations. From crispy Picking Duck, steam Chinese broccoli, rice roll, deep fried wonton to conggie.... you name it you can find it here. We arrived before 10:30am when they open, so we are the first customer here. They already have 3 Dim Sum carts ready to stroll.  Love the old school carts service!! We don't need to wait for the food to come by like other Dim Sum place which we love it. I know they have great dim sum when I see the restaurant is packed with locals who speak Cantonese :). We will come for a visit for sure next time in Vegas. The only downside is it's located out of strip and not closer to Chinatown, in middle of nowhere so you either need a car or Uber to get here. We took Uber from our hotel downtown which is way worthy. Huge parking at the front if you do drive. Can't wait to come back.",

Plain & simple this place knows how to do it right. Everything on the dim sum menu is incredible and consistent. The prices are very good and affordable. I love that they serve dim sum all day, everyday.   Sometimes when I am on my way to the movies I love popping in & grabbing a few dumplings & satisfying my tummy. It's quick and you never have to wait long for your food.   My fave items I always get are: pork shiu mai, shark fin dumplings, sticky rice in lotus leaves, pan fried chive dumplings ( the best ever ) and baked bbq pork buns that are so heavenly,  with the perfect combo of sweet, salty, sticky, it's like heavenly crack!  No matter where you are in the valley, this place is so worth traveling to! You won't be disappointed!!",

This is authentic Chinese Dim Sum and Dim Sum service if you do not know what you want by the looks of it you will not get much help from the cart ladies they are polite but curt and will just start handing you things.  I know that is a bit of an oxymoron but most who go here will understand.  Please do not let this deter you from enjoying the goodies they serve in their little tins of goodness.   I know what I want by looks and name so that is extremely helpful in these kind of situations!   My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  It seems as of late the word has gotten out because there are more and more people from other ethnicities visiting here they now just bring a fork instead of having to ask for one (I do not ever need one though but I know some of my friends and visitors do)  I also noticed a lot more smiles from the cart ladies as of late as well!  LOL I kinda like the grumpy, curt all about the food service of the past a bit.  However the food does not lie I do enjoy the Dim Sum and will continue to come back on a regular basis.  I have never even looked at the menu so I have no idea what else they have but who cares really its Dim Sum all day!   One tip I have learned from my boyfriend and his family in my many years, is drink the hot tea even if you are in Vegas and it is 116 outside, it helps digest the oils from the food and calms your stomach.",

Some was not worth the calories.  Seemed that the overall issue is the quality of ingredient.  Start with bad product, get bad final product.  Food was essentially tasteless.

They serve it all day every day, but the best time to go for the most freshly made dim sum is Saturday or Sunday at lunch time. That is when they are most busy for dim sum. So it'll be a bit of a wait, but this is when it'll taste the best.   There are many restaurants in the valley that serve dim sum, but Orchids Garden (in my opinion) offers the widest variety of tasty dim sum dishes and the most authentic dim sum eating atmosphere.  Never be shy about asking the ladies pushing the food carts what they have. They may be hard to understand, but they WANT you to order stuff from them, so they will be glad to show you. Be brave and try things you normally wouldn't eat. You may be surprised by some new delicious flavors.",

I know I'm biased growing up eating at this restaurant but it is seriously the best dim sum I've ever had and will ever have. I've eaten dim sum in San Francisco and nothing can beat the taste or price of orchids garden dim sum. Like ever. I think my mom and I had at least 8 plates plus imported Tsingtao beer. wanna know whats cool? it was all under 50 dollars. Great price for AMAZING food. A goal of mine one day is to try all of the plates they have!  So in a nutshell: come here, spend all day being a glutton eating the tasty bits of heaven, leave sated and happy! :D",

I can't spell the traditional names so I'm going to review in an american fashion.  SHRIMP anything is delicious . The shrimp with sugar cane is good. The shrimp with fried crispie stuff is good.  The steamed shrimp and pork shumai is good. I mean, it's dim sum! Mostly Everything is good! I even like the chicken feet and the tripe!   I guess what i can review best about is quality. Out of a few dim sum spots around town this place is my favorite. The food never disappoints!  Service is somewhat lacking as my water was empty a few times before i had to flag down a waiter to refill me.   Overall, if you want dim sum, ORCHID Gardens is the bee's knee's or the cat's pajama's..whatever you prefer.",

I mean its not fantastically good but better than the rest.   They do have Dim Sum around the clock but I would recommend going early - afternoon-ish just because the food is fresher because there are more people so they are preparing food constantly. Compared to going later when it is not busy, food can be sitting out for a while.  I would recommend going here or at least give it a shot.",

The food was mediocre, of course nothing is in comparable to the bay's Chinatown dim sum but since we were all starving after a long night and day of waiting for people to get dressed it hit the spot perfectly. the shrimp dumpling was awfully small dried and the rest of the food was tedious in its portion.   Normally, I would give it a 2stars but since It served all day and the bill came put to be only 60$ for 7 people ....I will simply forgive them and add an extra one star",

Jalepenos in generel tsos chicken is a sin against good chinese food yet every chinese establishment on the west coast seems to find it appropriate. After living here for 6 years I've gotten used to it. This place exceeded my expectations. The dim sum was good. We got one bowl of wonton soup and it was big enough for the 4 of us. The entrees (i had kung pao chicken) were delicious, authentic, and nice portions. We have gone there for dine in and take out many times after this experience. It has become the only place we go for chinese. Now, if this place was compared to any chinese back home it would have just been so-so but its the best we've found out here so 5 stars for Vegas !!!",

    "text": "Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese cuisine in which small portions of a variety of foods, including an assortment of steamed or fried dumplings, are served in succession.    Easter Sunday and it was my cousin Manny, my mother and I eating out for lunch.  Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.    The place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.  So steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.    We picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.  Overally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)  The ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.  Overall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine.",

They do have a Parking Lot that is also used with the Other Businesses in the Area. They have Restrooms located on the Right of the Entrance, and to the Left is the Restaurant. You Have to Wait to be Seated by the Cashier, * Just a Note: You May have to Wait a While, Depending on How Busy they are.  Once Seated, You will be Greeted by your Waitress, She will leave an Order Tab at your Table which will be used for when you start to order from the Carts that come around. * Get the Hot Green Tea, it's Delish!  You will Notice Servers pushing Carts around the Restaurant, that's where you Start Your Meal! It is Dim Sum, so don't expect Rice, Unless you Order it! The Dim Sum Selection is a Little Limited, and it Varies from Time to Time..You can Also Order \"Family Style\" just ask for a Menu!  When Ordering Dim Sum, the Order Tab will be Stamped by the Servers, and You get your Dim Sum, Hot & Ready! Depending on what you Order, it is usually 3-4 Pieces, Per Dim Sum. My faves are the BBQ Pork Bun, Pork Hash, And a Shrimp Dish with Spinach & Watercress, Wrapped & Steamed (looks like a Bigger version of the Pork Hash). Sorry, I don't know the Name of it...lol! (One More Pointer I should Give You...the Servers are a Little hard to Understand, so You can just Point to what you want, or Ask them)!  Service is either a Hit or Miss, but Worth Trying!! Dim Sum Served All Day....Every Day!  :)",

Having just moved to vegas, I'm hesitant to try Asian restaurants unless I hear good things about them from people (or yelp!) because, well, you can get sick if they don't run a clean ship in the back kitchen. Luckily, this place is very clean.   Basically your typical dim sum place, which for all of you who don't know is kinda like tapas (small plates) of Chinese food. Servers come past the tables pushing carts full of food that you can choose from. They bill you at the end of the meal according to a little order card on your table, which they stamp/write on when you get each plate.   We had the chow mein (fried noodles), the choy sum (Chinese broccoli), shumai (pork meatballs in egg wrapper), shrimp balls, shrimp potstickers, char siu bao (steamed pork bun), chive dumplings, and the crab balls. Make sure you get those crab balls. They have a crab claw sticking out of them to identify them and they look weird, but they are sooooooo juicy and delicious. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had fried taro \"footballs.\" I'm from Hawaii and taro isn't something I'd expected to see in a vegas restaurant, so yay! (Taro is a starchy root vegetable similar to a potato. A staple in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. Not sure what they call it in Chinese.)   When in doubt, just point to what you want on the cart. Prices are reasonable ($50 for three hungry people, including drinks) so definitely venture out and try things!",

Was not to sure what this whole dim sum thing was about only that it was small portions that came to you on carts and you just picked what you wanted. Went with 2 girlfriends from school and we were hungry. We ended up getting 9 plates to share. It did not seem like a lot of food because everything came in 3s. Three small potstickers, three small pork balls, three small this, and that. Well we were so wrong.    After eating all the different things we had to be rolled out of there.   Place was good, only problem is you don't know how much things cost when they are wheeling them around. They ask if you want it, you say yes, they give it to you then they take a stamp and place it on A,B,C etc.  at the end they take your ticket and bring you back your bill with the price. Everything in Chinese except the dollar amount.   I would go back and give it another try. Like I said food was good. It was kept hog and fresh.",

If you are unfamiliar with how dim sum works, there are carts that bring food around, you point to what you want and the server stamps a card on your table.  When you are done they add-up all the stamps.    This place has fresh items and good amount of variety.",

The service is prompt, the food is delicious, and it's just plain dim sum yumminess.   Upon sitting down, the carts are at your table. There's no time to waste on Dim Sum Sunday! They clean your tables pretty fast too, but don't let them rush you. Enjoy it.  Most places use a lot of sesame oil in their dim sum items, not Orchid Garden. You leave satisfied... full.... but not wanting to sit in stretchy pants.  Their pork buns (the ones in my picture) are lightly brushed with honey. The bun is fluffy and the pork isn't too \"saucy\". The mushroom shu mai is my favorite over the regular shu mai. It actually tastes like there is meat inside. If you're a fan of eggplant, try the fried eggplant (seen in my picture).  I'm not a huge fan, but even I loved this tasty morsel. The red bean sesame rolls are unreal - crunchy outside, steamy chewy inside, and the slightly sweet bite of red bean in the middle. The seaweed salad is meh. STick to the dim sum items and you can't go wrong.  Be sure to check them out and remember it's meant to be eaten slowly! Sip that tea, digest, and grub down. ;-)",

Got here at 4pm today, it was a terrible idea but Chris really wanted dim sum. Everything was either soggy or dry,  old and definitely not fresh, I am writing this review in pain, my stomach hurt, this never happened to me,  I have a very strong stomach but something was definitely wrong with the food. I hope I dont have a food poisoning.  Do not come here after 2pm,  they will serve you old nasty food that have been waiting in the steamer for hours.",

My favorites were: Shrimp ball in eggplant & Rice Noodle with Beef (ask for xtra sauce on side from this dish for some of the other plates that only serve a mayo sauce)  All the others seemed pretty standard or too greasy.  This place is excellent for groups  & kids,  and they have flat screens to watch football.  It's not the best dim sim, however, service is quick and there is ample parking in the front & rear.",

Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!  I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best True dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too.   If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!  Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!  The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!",

    "text": "I've had many Dim Sum experiences in many different cities across the US.  Although I've lived in Las Vegas or 5 years now, this is officially my FIRST Dim Sum experience in this city.  We came here to celebrate Chinese New Years last night, so Kung Hee Fat Chow.  Or Gung Hee Fat Chow, depending on your dialect.    The outside of the building transport you to an authentic city in China.  Chinese lettering and a huge sign that read, \"Dim Sum all day\" really brought us in.  The carpet is definitely outdated, older tables as well.  Adding yellow lining lights on the ceiling and you're now transported to 1960's China.  Definitely needs a revitalization.  The staff is cordial.  Definitely not as pushy to sell you more Dim Sum as I've experienced in other cities.  They also explain the dishes thoroughly in English so you know what you're getting.  Here's what we got:  Chow Mein - probably like 4 plates altogether.  A little oily but so good.  Small crispy noodles with grilled onions.    Fried Shrimp Puff - Got 3 plates of this in all.  Crispy gyoza like dumplings filled with shrimp.  Super yummy!  Served with a dollop of mayonnaise.      Juicy Pork Dumpling - Watch out!  The juicy liquid is hot so don't just stick it in your mouth so quickly!  Perfectly steamed.  Steamed Pork Shiu Mai - Reminds me of pork hash from back home in Hawaii.  LOVE.  Shrimp Shiu Mai -  Exactly like the pork, just with shrimp.  Still love.  Shrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper - They actually shaped the paste into a ball and placed it on top of a big square of steamed bell pepper. The pepper was a little odd.  Pork and Chive Shiu Mai - SUPER OILY.  I had to wipe it down with my napkin.  All in all, a little too oily.  My hands were constantly oily all night.  Not the best experience, I've had better dim sum.  Don't take my word for it.  Please come by and see if you feel the same!",

Believe me it was white and not fried, last time we ate here it was fried and delicious. So then the waitress brings out white rice without the egg and thinks that what i wanted, i said no I just wanted fried rice. She continues to argue with me, why not offer to get me a new order of fried rice, or get something different. No customer service skills, didnt even try to make the situation better. Then if that wasnt bad enough the chicken was grey and had pieces of  bones in it. Im not even sure if it was chicken! I mean this place has been shut down before for filthy conditions, i should have known better. No offer to reduce the bill, nothing. I also think language is a problem here. This place is a dump i dont suggest you eat here, hopefully more will not get food poisioning. Hell China A Go Go is better.",

Service (4):  They normally dont serve you, they are usually just there to refill your drinks and give your receipt.  Other than that, they go around and you pick & choose what you want.   Quality (4.5): The food taste wonderful and I have tried a variety of their selections that they offered.  I love their sesame balls, pork shumai, shrimp noodle, fried rice, etc.   Atmosphere (4):  Looks clean, sometimes it has a weird smell, comfortable. Overall(4):  I love this restaurant and I would come back here everytime I crave for some dimsum.  There were a couple of times where we would get here and literally 15minutes were are done eating.",

I would highly disagree..lol I was sub par at best with lack of flavor and cooking time of certain dishes that need to be cooked longer for the meats/ tendons/ and or other organs to property become consistance of how the traditional dim sum dish is suppose to be.  The service was a bit lacking as well",

I made him pick up the check, because that's just punishment for this kind of idea.  Dim Sum was a D+ at best - this is compared to all other Dim Sums.  If you have to choose something, get the pork siomai.  It's a solid C-, so it's the best you're gonna get here.  The entrees (Why order an entree at a Dim Sum place?  Shame on me, I know.) were not edible.  I really mean it.  The fried rice wasn't fried and the beef... well, it wasn't beef.  If you have thin skin, or like clean dishes, go elsewhere.  The ladies on the carts would give you some serious stink eye if you didn't take their grade D meat.  And if you ask for a fork without any residue, more stink eye!    Worst chinese in Nevada.  (That's really saying something)",

I love that I can get dim sum all day and that's why we'll keep coming back.   Going right at opening, 10:30 on Saturday morning, was great so we could beat the rush and be seated right away. We also ordered a 1/2 duck which was pretty typical and good; the sweet ginger tofu dessert is really good here!",

Most items come  in at B (mid) or C (large)-level pricing ($3.20 and $4.30 per dish, respectively) and offer good portions and surprisingly good quality for such reasonable prices. For example, I wasn't disappointed with staples like the har gow, siu mai, cheong fun, or eggplant with shrimp.   If you're here on a weekend or a holiday, come first thing in the morning; otherwise, you can expect quite a wait, as you can see hordes of people waiting outside as you drive up. Service is pretty fast and efficient inside, or \"sing mook\" as we say in Cantonese. On that note, all the folks here do speak Cantonese so you know it's authentic.   Thanks Yelpers for a great find that made for a welcome diversion from the Strip!",

Variety of the offerings was low, smaller portion sizes and the servers were not as friendly as we remembered. Maybe because we went after the lunch rush while waiting to check into our hotel. Prices are still reasonable ranging from $3.50 to about $4.50. We will come back on our next trip to Vegas and give this place another try.",

My family and I don't speak english fluently so we were mostly spacing out at the beginning because we wouldn't understand how the restaurant worked. If someone wants to come here but doesn't know how this restaurant works, basically you can order family size plates (as any other Chinese restaurant) but there are people with carts full of different appetizers or food. They have to give you a menu with the prize of each plate that will be in the carts (it's pretty cheap). If you want a plate you ask for it and the lady or the employer will put a stamp on your order.   As I said it is great, the food is great and the \"theme\" or whatever you call it is great. But you need to understand how this type of restaurant works before going to one, otherwise is going to get a little bit messy.  One small advice is that those plates that are in the carts are delicious, so try not to order many family size plates if you want to take multiple things from the carts. (Sorry if it is difficult to understand this review. I hope it can be helpful though)",

If you live in a city with amazing dim sum (SoCal etc) you'll likely find this place just ok, but for anyone coming from towns that don't have much, you will enjoy this.  The pros here is that they have dim sum all day, and the restaurant space is large to accommodate many people. Parking is available in the large lot, but I could see parking being a problem if many large families bought many cars and filled up the place. The restaurant was about half full when we dined in, and the carts came around quickly offering us various dishes. I thought the selection was pretty decent, and they certainly have all the \"essentials\". There are some fancier places that have more options but I think Orchids does just fine with what they provide.  I would return if I got another dim sum craving while visiting Vegas!",

The staff is inattentive sometimes, and when you ask for something, like an extra rice bowl or extra utensils, they usually forget it. I had ordered beef tendon because they didnt have it in the cart. We were a big party so I got 4 orders. But they never brought it in until we were done with the food and paid the bill already. Everyone in the table forgot the order, so we were surprised when they brought the plates in. Suffice it to say, we had to just take it to go.

One thing I noticed that even in a group of about 8 they would ask each person anytime they had food to offer drinks or needed more services. The food here was really great! Based on my friends' reactions I'd recommend the duck, we got it with buns. Surprisingly enough though it definitely was the fried tofu that was amazing and one of the best things I had to eat.   My concerns are that while the staff was attentive when there, they were not often attentive throughout the night. The green tea served was also never replenished and with a large group that is something I would have appreciated. However, these concerns are minor enough that I'm still more than happy to give this place 4/5 stars !",

The lines are always long but the turn-around time is pretty quick.  All of the dishes were fresh and hot! Carts are always full and the ladies were coming by so often, we had to pass until they came around again. We ordered at least 20+ dishes, everything was as delicious as the next. It was hard to choose which one to eat!  We ordered the typical - Har gow, sui mai, Chicken feet, char sui bao, sugarcane shrimp, shrimp ball, shrimp on green pepper, custard bun, sesame yellow paste ball, dumplings and chive balls.

The second, we brought another family here, again before church. Party of 10, round table (was not happy about the location), total almost $200.   Ordered some fried rice right away. Ehhh, it's ok. But I want fried rice with all the food coming our way. Here we go!  1. Steamed bbq pork buns: Oh my Lordy, I was afraid I'd have to take my husband to UMC again, just like when we ate at this Cajun shrimp place on Jones. He would not stop ordering this that I had to tell him to slow down. When he likes something, he goes overboard.  2. Steamed pork shiu mai: My love affair with shiu mai started when I was pregnant with my first. The boys liked this too.  3. Shrimp har gow: I ordered this because it's seafood, mouth watering.  4. Shrimp dumpling: Anything shrimp, bring it over I shouted! J/k 5. Mushroom shiu mai: Get in my belly, I like mushrooms too. Thoughts running through my head... Stop the ordering!  I think I'm gonna stop right here, you get the idea right? We ordered almost everything after 2 visits and I know I will be coming here again. We were stuffed, mommy puts on her cardigan to hide the bulging.... Shame on us!",

Once you're seated they'll come to you with their different types of dimsum and all. Selections of Dimsum and foods are delicious. Great prices. For 3 of us and many choices, our bill came out about $32. Staffs were nice and service is great too. Literally no waiting time!! Will come back again for chicken feet (pan fried noodles are highly recommended too!)",

Their food is pretty good quality especially for the amount you're paying which totals only about 17$/person and that is eating until you can't move! There's usually a wait but it's so fast it only takes about 5 minutes on regular days.",

I mean you can also order from the waiters but good luck on trying to get their attention. If you don't see it in the cart you can try to get it from waiters but make sure you know the name of that dim sum.  It takes awhile for them to get to you and they are running around like crazy. But other than that it's the usual dim sum way. Wait wait wait and bam 5 carts right there.  And you're trying to scramble and order it all. We pretty much ordered the simple dumplings, noodles, the ones with shrimp in it (lol) and we also got tea which is complementary.   This location is in a plaza so parking is good.  Unless it's the weekend it gets crowded.  The wait to be seated for us that day was 5 minutes. Now that was amazing we usually wait about 30 mins or longer.  The price for this place is not bad, reasonable. But when is dim sum ever inexpensive.",

We began to order pork buns but were told by the waitress that we can pick from the already cooked options on a cart that was being rolled around. Otherwise, it would take 45 min to make any dim sum not on the cart and would be very inconvenient to them as the tone in her voice expressed. There were only 3 or 4 options, which we did not want, but that isn't at all the reason for the 1 star.   We would have stayed and ordered off of their regular menu (non dim sum) if it weren't for our waitress's horrendous attitude. She was very condescending about us not knowing we had to order from the cart. The way she told us was so rude and off putting. It was clear she didn't want us at her table so we left. Won't be coming back.",

Some of the food was not as hot as I would have liked it to be. Other than that we enjoyed it.  My favorite is shrimp har gow and it was hot because we had to wait for it to be made.  We also had chow mien, fried shrimp ball, fried shrimp puff, crab claw and steamed shrimp dumpling which was just ok.  For dessert I always have the baked egg tart and it was delicious.

So we waited for about 45 minutes to be seated, I do suggest if you decide to go here come prepared  to wait. They do need a better way to notify customers that there table is ready instead of just yelling our your number. Now as for the food it's really good.

We sampled the following:   Fruit custard tarts: pretty average, didn't feel freshly made. I would stick to the main dishes which dim sum places excel at.  A variety of dumplings (we tried the fried pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pan-fried pork dumplings, and glutinous rice footballs with meat): all of the dumplings were good and satisfied the grease and meat craving that we all had after a Friday night out. My favorite was the glutinous rice footballs, which are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and contains a bit of pork meat on the inside as well. Chinese broccoli with seafood sauce: quite good. It was nice to have a purely vegetable dish, but the veggies were coated in oil so I'm not sure how much healthier they are.  Siu mai: delicious! Xiao long bao: on the small side and not filled with much delicious broth. I've definitely had much better XLB elsewhere.  Zhong zi: quite good, but again not filled with as much meat and goodies as I have had elsewhere.  Overall service was fast and efficient, and the value was great ($63 to feed 6 of us, so only about $10 a person for everyone to be pleasantly satisfied but not uncomfortably full). I took off a star because although the food was quite good, I felt some of the dishes skimped a little on the fillings.",

Everything I have tried here has great texture & all flavorful. The exterior of all the dimsum I have tried here are all delicate & thin as I prefer. Soft & chewy in the inside too. Other dimsum I have tried has been tough & chewy. And really missing the flavor orchids has.    As for service, now yes it's not the greatest. But I honestly have not been to many dimsum places w/ amazing service. It's decent here. Depending on who you get. Hence the 4 stars. Otherwise I would rate this place an easy 5 just for their dimsum.",

From the honey walnut shrimp to the pan fried Hong Kong noodles AND alongside pick and choose from DIM DUM ALL DAY carts.. you cannot go wrong with this place. Aside from how dull the restaurant looks inside and out, you definitely would not expect very tasty hot plates coming out of the kitchen. My ultimate fav Chinese restaurant is in Westminister, Ca at Seafood Cove (which I have yet to write a review) and Orchids Garden reminded me of the flavors that trigger my happiness and feeling of a fully content tummy... but a plus here... remember the ALL DAY DIM SUM? Just an extra bonus to add to the goodness to traditional Chinese entrees with your family. Ever in the mood for inexpensive full flavored Chinese food? You must try try try!",

It served Dim Sum all day. But as expected, the dim sums after the rush hour, i.e. at night, was awful. During lunch hours when the foods were fresh, and abundant. The variety has been standard. Nothing too surprising. Lots of fried foods for American.  The price, as in all Las Vegas, was higher for what it's worth. For 2 people the last time we ate there, it's $30 for 10 items. Egg tarts are medium price (all places I've been to charged low price). The chow mien was a bit bland. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was very tender on the stalk.  So diners, it's good to have dim sum here during busy hour. For tourists, it's Las Vegas. Get used to it.",

During lunch time the prices are way better than going later in the day I believe after 3 or 4. I recently just went this passed weekend and we had a party of five adults and 1 child and we pretty much all stuffed of dim sum, soy sauce and hot tea for 38.37. I was stuffed. I will be back!

    "text": "For LV, this place sure knows how to make good dim sum.  I've only been here once, and it was just as good (possibly even better) than Seafood Paradise in Westminster.  After a night of clubbing and drinking this really hit the spot.  1.  The place looks ok, I think they can fix it up a little, but it's not gross or anything.  Regular cloths, uncomfortable chairs, not too roomy to walk around.  It's not too bad, but definitely not a first date location.  2.  The service is pretty good.  They were attentative, fast, and courteous.  They brought us the dishes quickly and were eager to serve.  The water refills came every so often, and they brought us rice as well.  3.  The food was so fresh and delicious.  I don't know if it was because it was so fresh and I was hung over or if it is just the cooks there, but the food was PERFECT.  It was a perfect brunch for 12 of us.  We literally cleaned out all of their carts and the restaurant had to wait about 10 mins for more dim sum.  And once that came out, we did some damage to that too.  The total bill for us was $12.50 per person, and that's including tax and tip.  Seriously!  That cheap to feed all of us with delicious Chinese Brunch?  Win!!  This is definitely a great dim sum place for Vegas.  I'll hit this place up again for sure when I'm in the mood for something off the strip.",

My response?  Well they must have their act together now.  We were sat promptly in the vast room at a large round table.  A server came by immediately and offered us drinks and then we were bombarded by a line of waitresses sling all kinds of food items of a plastic encased rolling gueridon.  A lot of times, we couldn't understand what they were selling, but we tried it anyway, cause we were feeling adventurous.    One overwhelming factor in my poor experience was the temperature of the food.  Out of the ten items we received, one was hot, three were luke warm, and six were cold.  The flavors and textures were decent, but it was pretty hard to get past the temperature issue.     Maybe i'll com back and try ordering off the menu, but for now, thumbs down.",

My group of people wanted some good Chinese food, so with some advice from one of my friend's local relatives, we strayed away from The Strip and came here.   They had all the normal dim sum goodies... sui mai, BBQ pork buns, flour rice sheet with shrimp, deep fried shrimp balls and more! Everything was pretty fresh and I DIDN'T get sick after eating here. Amazing! I loved their desserts. They had mango pudding and this fabulous sweet egg custard bun (not made with the typical white bun, but more like a pastry). They're Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. I thought the black bean short ribs had a strange taste to them. But overall, I had a great experience here.  It's definitely worth coming here if you want to get away from The Strip and pay REASONABLE prices for some good food. To feed NINE people it only cost about $80, including tax AND tip. AMAZING! Another time we ate there, it only cost about $50 to feed all nine of us again. It's almost a miracle that you can even eat for that cheap in Vegas! Don't let this miracle slip away!",

I have been searching for some \"community\" tradition in Vegas where most everything is about the tourist and those of us who actually live here kind of get lost in the fray.   Well, I think I have found my little bit of togetherness on a Sunday at Orchid's Garden. Very crowded, very loud and bursting with energy.   Trolley pushing ladies running from corner to corner of a packed dinning room make it a bit hard to hear about the selections. So, my friends and I are not sure what to call everything we ate. Everything we ate tasted lovely, especially the custard rolls---yum we had to get seconds.   It was not the cleanest nor the most upscale decorated but it gives a little tone of hominess.",

The employees were nice enough, however, we were not asked if this was our first time dining there.  We were unaware of the two choices they have 1) off the regular menu or 2) off the \"rolling cart\" menu.  We were a bit confused, so we decided to do the \"rolling cart\" menu.  It was challenging understanding the woman offering us the menu choices.  There is a menu that has pictures, but a lot of the menu items looked the same.   Overall, the food was absolutely NASTY.  It was old and greasy.  The calamari was cold, so we sent it back.  All they did was throw it back in the fryer.  So now it was hot but overcooked.  My husband, who always tries to find something positive, did like the Fried Rice.  It was very greasy.   When I woke at 2:30 am with a very queasy stomach, I realized it was from thinking about the food I had eaten at the Orchids Garden.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  Still looking for a decent Chinese Restaurant.",

    "text": "We went on a Sunday afternoon (around 1 PM) and the left side of the restaurant was packed; I don't think the right side was open.  Despite the number of people, we did not have to wait to be seated at all.  It has been YEARS since I've had dim sum in an actual dim sum restaurant so I was excited.  It was my companion's first time (ever) to a dim sum restaurant, and I think he liked it.  I gave 3 stars because there were a lot of carts and a lot of different items to choose from, but not very many just meat or just veggie options.  We were seated quickly and our water and hot tea were brought at promptly as was our plain steamed rice (for my semi-picky 2-year old)  Also, a lot of what we ordered was a little greasier than I expected it to be.  I don't know the exact names for the items but I'll try my best to describe them.  CHOW FUN: I think that is what the lady called it.  I'm used to chow fun being flat noodles cut finger-width and quickly sauteed with some meat and veggies and soy sauce.  This chow fun was kind of like one big sheet of rice noodle rolled up, then sliced into 1-inch logs and cooked in oil, soy sauce and chili.  Whatever it was, I liked it and would definitely order again.  FRIED CALAMARI: Crispy, chewy, crunchy with a little spice (from a small amount of diced jalapeno).  It was alright.  I've had better and I've had worse.  My daughter had fun eating this one.  PORK BUNS: We had two kinds. One steamed and I think the other was baked with honey on top.  Both had a sweet red pork filling.  I liked the steamed version while my companion preferred the softer, sweeter, baked version.  TURNIP CAKE:  Kinda mushy, warm and Turnip-y.  It was how I remembered turnip cake to be (only back home they would fry it to order in front of you).  My companion did not care for it, but it reminded me of home.  I guess its an acquired taste, or a textural preference.  EGGPLANT WITH SHRIMP PASTE:  I don't know if this is steamed or fried.  The shrimp part was alright; the eggplant was a little greasy and under-seasoned.  The server added a little mystery sauce (soy reduction or oyster sauce...I don't know) but that didn't really help.  PORK SHUMAI: tasted like shu-mai? Kind of like the calamari: I've had better and I've had worse.  CREAM  PUFF: that's what they called it.  It was a soft baked bun filled with a small amount of plain whipped butter and topped with shredded coconut.  We were disappointed.  It was alright, but not what we were expecting.  EGG TART: simple egg  custard baked in a puff pastry shell.  My personal favorite... a little skimpy on the filling, but I didn't  mind.  SESAME BALL:  it was just ok.  Crispy on the outside and semi-sweet on the inside.  The rice paste came out a little mushy/pasty instead of chewy.  The table next to us had some fried chicken wings but none of the carts we saw had them.  I did see some chicken feet pass by, though.  I'd come back again...but I'd probably ask to see a menu, too...Just in case.",

Well here is my take on this past experience:  Personally, I thought food was average/ could have been much better. We came here when they first opened and things were fresh and delicious. This time around, not the same. The Shao Long Bao (Pork Mini Buns) were dry and nasty. The rice wrapped in lotus leaves tasted a bit odd and the Shu Mai and Chicken hands could have been much better prepared. Something just didn't taste right when I ate it. Maybe it was just a bad experience this time around? I mean we do come here often when we visit Vegas. So for now, I suppose I give them a 2.5/3 for their decent food. I'll be back, don't worry! I'll let you know how they hold up :)",

I'm not knocking them for the service, I usually only get dim sum when it's really busy & crowded so I expect them to want us in & out of there asap.   We grabbed like 8 different types of dishes for the table, but the har gow, pork buns (cha siu bao), & shumai: get that shit. Twice. Everything is super fresh, but these are the dishes I came for & they generally dominate any dim sum experience. Such was the case here. We payed about $60 for 5 of us ($12/person) & were stuffed when we finished.   Parking was full, but I found a spot quick.

Which means their dim sum must be good, right?  This was my 2ndt time here.  First time was almost 8 years ago.  We ordered the regular dim sum fare and although their dim sum weren't as good as the ones out in Los Angeles, it wasn't bad.  The carts came around quite often and the food was fresh and hot.  They also had quite a large selection of dim sum items.  Their shrimp dumpling was a little on the small side.  Although their small dim sum are only $2.10, they have quite a few items that cost more than that. So, when all is said and done, the two of us spent over $30 for dim sum.  The next time I have the urge for dim sum, I will definitely come back and try some of their other dim sum items.",

'Yum Tsa' back in Hong Kong, this place served them all day and all night! We ordered the crab balls, siu mai, egg tarts and from the menu, house special pan fried noodles as well as chicken fried rice.   Once they arrived, we stared at our plates as the food glistened in all that oil! No doubt it tasted pretttttttty good! The crab balls went perfectly with the fried rice and the egg tarts were a great way to end the night. With a cute serving of 3, my parents and I had one each!   Atmosphere was pretty mellow. It gave me this deep sense of nostalgia for Hong Kong where I lived for 18 years. The service could do with some improvement although I would understand that working a whole day wouldn't really motivate a smile. Just a little less on the cold approach and I'd probably give this place a 4.5 :)   Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience, comparable to HK star only with more variety on the dumplings and reasonable prices throughout the day (HK star shoots up its prices for dinner)",

It'll stand up decently too in San Francisco, where I'm from.  It won't be the best place -- but it'll be a place I'd frequent regularly for the quality and value of the food.  Why, you say?  Cuz their baked goods are, well, GOOD!  Try, for examples, the miniature baked BBQ pork in a buttery, flaky pastry.  Love it!  The miniature egg custard.  Well done!  The crust is good...  the custard... well, they could use a little more egg whites.  But in any case, their baked goods are excellent!  Har gow, Shumai, Lo mai kai, fried shrimp dumpling, chicken feet, cheung fun (you know, the regulars), these all are pretty good.  I stuffed myself with 5 plates and it cost me $12.50 + tips.  One last thing...  I haven't tried Chang's yet -- I'm going to.   But as far as I'm concerned, Orchid Garden is as authentic as it's going to get in LV.    I walked in, for the first time, one Sunday early afternoon and was greeted by the loud clanging of chopsticks against plates and the familiar hum of hundreds of loud conversation melded into one -- now that's an authentic dim sum joint.",

    "text": "Where did the shumai go?!?! It shrank at Orchids, that's for sure. I don't know if its fair to compare this place to any Dim Sum spots that I've been to in a Chinatown in SF or LA. But I've tasted better, and I will. Honestly, the Dim Sum wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I walked in and it definitely looked and smelled like the usual Chinese restaurant but the food definitely didn't taste like one. The breaded shrimp balls were of usual size but it came with only two pieces. I don't think I've ever been to a Dim Sum spot where they only serve you two pieces of anything, its usually 4. This has to be bad Feng Shui. Like I brought up earlier, they were also serving the smallest shumai that I've EVER seen. The pork buns were delicious due to the fluffy white bread with glaze on top, but there was hardly any pork, they should just call it BUN! I know we are in a recession, but geez, don't make it so obvious!   Its a bit far from the strip and the prices are decent. With the size of their dishes it better be affordable. This is the only Dim Sum place that I've tried in LV and I know all the other ones are a bit more pricey, so this may be a good spot for locals but not if you've been to any Chinatown before. I would only comeback if friends decide to comeback, otherwise I would pass.  The only positive is that we were able to sit 24 people instantly. Which is A-OK in my book!",

The Dim Sum was okay.  We had a variety of dishes, but nothing was superb. The neither-good-nor-bad:  Orchids Garden also has American-style Chinese food (Chow mein, sweet and sour something...).  I saw an Anglo couple (I'm Anglo, too) with those kinds of dishes on their table.  There were also plenty of Asians eating Dim Sum or real Chinese food.  If I were going out for Chinese food with a very mixed group (which would be my classmates, or my former colleagues), this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking.",

I love the tripe and the har gow as well as the white radish cakes and the congee. We enjoy every dish we get from this place.    I took away one star for two reasons. 1. the place is a bit dirty and 2. the dim sum cart ladies are relentless. They come by your table if you even make accidental eye contact with them and start putting dishes on your table when you didn't even order it. You have to really say no to them to go away but then 5 minutes later they are back.",

    "text": "so this time, i decided to go to another location for dim sum b/c of my recent experience at another restaurant.  its the only chinese- themed structured restaurant on sahara blvd and its HUGE.  right when i drove up to the parking lot, it was full, but luckily there was parking in the back.  inside, two rooms on the left and right were packed with people, a huge variety, and a major portion chinese (Cantonese)...according to my adorable companion.  i wanted to be in the main room b/c i can see all the silver carts filled with colorful food items frantically moving around the tables.  the smells and sights made me so hungry. for some odd reason everytime they filled our teapot, they would not close it well, so i kept spilling tea out from the top.  the basic steam items were ok.  i do have to say my favorite chicken feet  in black bean sauce was hella tasty.  the chinese broccoli drowned in oyster was alright, how do you go wrong with that?  they did have shanghai dumplings, but the skin was a bit thick and took away the flavor of the meat inside.  they did have my favorite shark fin dumpling soup with the vinegar, but i was told that the shark fin that i have always thought to be in this dish was sometimes replaced with glass noodles...is it b/c im not chinese???   otherwise it did taste good.   i also had the yummy egg tarts and egg tarts w/fruit.  i also had the silky tofu in sugar-ginger soup....ooh  so warm to my belly.  i think its a good idea to come around 12:30pm, b/c the longer we stayed the more new dishes came out.  right before we were leaving, we saw the this pineapple bun filled yellow egg custard.  that was the first time i had that.  imagine, taking a bite on a sweet crusty bun and having creamy yellow egg custard squeeze into your mouth.  so for now, this place will have to do as i join my lovely dining companion for the search for the best place for dim sum in all of vegas...stay tuned b/c i have another restaurant in mind already.....",

I spoke to a young Asian couple there and asked if there were any good dim sum places in the area. They said Chang's was as good as it gets in Vegas. They did mention Orchids Garden as a close alternative. So lunch time hits and here I am. The staff was friendly I was seated right away and the carts immediately came to my table. I tried the same dishes as Chang's which were shiu mai, har gow and rice noodle rolls with shrimp. I also tried the fried shrimp ball with fried sugar cane sticks  which I did not see on Chang's menu. The shiu mai was fresh and delicious, very comparable to places back home as was the har gow. The rice noodle rolls were equally tasty and slightly better than back home. We have a different version of the sugar cane shrimp roll back home that has a crab leg in place of the fried sugar cane stick. The shrimp used in this item had a great flavor and the texture to the shrimp ball was perfect. 5 stars and this is definitely going to be my regular dim sum spot!!!",

It's totally unheard of, I hope the seafood is made out of gold!  After having spent a week here in Vegas without having any asian food, I had a craving so I came here.  Looking at the prices, I thought this place must serve some stellar chinese food.  Well, it disappointed me.  While the staff was very friendly and a couple of the waiters even flirted with me (hehehe...), I just didn't think the food was all that great, especially one that prides itself on being a great chinese restaurant serving authentic Hong Kong style cuisine.  I got the seafood pan fried noodles which was $18 and then a serving of the roasted pork belly for $16.  The food was mediocre and very pricey.  It however, had a nice view of people on the gondolas at the Venetian.  The restaurant was pretty dead for it being a Friday night at the busy Venetian casino.",

And Orchids Garden does not disappoint. If you think I'm being sarcastic, you're wrong. i'm not. I genuinely believe that a proper and authentic dim sum experience involves some dingy chairs and loud, pushy little asian ladies.   The food is pretty good, not AMAZING, but authentic and DIM SUM ALL DAY!!! i ONLY took one star off because the one thing that every dim sum place should get right is those little flat shrimp rice wraps that they douse in that vinegar sauce? I don't know the name, but surely you know what I'm talking about... anyways, those should always be amazing and here they were a little bland.   The only thing is that unless you live in Las Vegas, rented a car or have a friend with a car this is pretty hard to get to because it's definitely not on the strip and is actually a little far from the strip. worth it if you want to get some good chinese food. also its REALLY CHEAP. i was with a bunch of people and we split it but i ate a ton of different variety stuff and my check was $10.",

Now, let me start by mentioning I'm a huge advocate for Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast. Past the cheesy name and the location I think it serves up some serious Dim Sum.   Orchids Garden however, was basically Ping Pang without any cons. The Dim Sum was supurb. It was a constant stream of different dishes being sent out every five minutes. Everything I recognized from the shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and Coconut Pastries to Fried Calamari, Clams & Mussels, and even Fried Shrimp covered in noodles.   Every single dish was equal or above the quality Ive experienced at Ping Pang, or Cathay House, making Orchids numuro UNO on my list of must try Dim Sum. I cannot wait till next Tuesday for more Dim Sum @ OG's :)",

The food was good too. I really couldn't be judgemental because I was really hungry and had no time to savor the moment. The dim sum was good I do have to say. However the wrapped rice was a bit too much on the portion side for me.  Mango mochi was for dessert and wasn't all that good. It tasted more like peach than mango.   $115 for 4 people is pretty reasonable for all the food we ordered.  Happy Eats!",

A local realtor recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  In fact, our entire meal was absolutely delicious!  Two Chinese members of our party did the ordering so the variety was excellent, we had dishes that I have never ordered/tasted before.  And while I confess my tastes may be a bit pedestrian, I especially enjoyed the fried shrimp with shell (which I order often), it was delicately crispy and not too salty.  My other favorites were shrimp in rice noodle rolls, spinach dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf, shrimp balls, siu mai, bbq pork buns, chinese broccoli, sweet tofu and fried sesame balls.  I was even impressed with the baked egg tart.  It's pastry was crumbly and the egg custard tasted home made.  I left absolutely stuffed, everything was so good that I ate more than was sensible!  Price was reasonable, decor was what one typically expects (broken in and a bit kicked up), ample parking.  I absolutely recommend this dim sum restaurant as a great place to check out in Las Vegas!",

They have the typical offerings like shu mai, har gow, and chicken feet, but the real kicker is that they have it all day!  For the most part, their food is tasty and filling for a low price. Go ahead, indulge in the char siu bao and sesame balls! Just note that the har gow and shrimp wrapped in rice noodle stick together and are scantily filled. Besides the portion size, another issue is that some of the dishes can be bland.  The vast, clean dining space accommodates both the diners and the little old Chinese ladies pushing their metal carts. These carts sure make their rounds quick! Pretty sure the same lady made a few laps before we ordered something from her cart. Plenty of parking is found in the front and back of the building. I like that there's room to maneuver around in and out of the restaurant, because it gets claustrophobic at Chang's.  The portions and flavor could be improved, but Orchids Garden is pretty decent for dim sum in Vegas.",

The ladies with the dim sum carts hustle hard and flow freely throughout the huge restaurant always ready to give you what you need. Prices are reasonable and well worth it. The wait to be seated (if not pack'd) is not long at all. On Sundays, its a must to get their early by 11am if not the place fills up and the wait for a seat begins. Try it out if you come to Las Vegas. The only place that serves dim sum everyday, all day.",

What kind of dim sum place doesnt have Siu Mai ?! Just for that I wish I could give it ZERO stars. But there were other factors that contributed to this low grade.  None of the food looked or tasted fresh. AT ALL. The carts weren't even steamers so most of the food was COLD. The only plus about this place was that they were able to accommodate 16 of us in almost no time at all. Other than that, I would recommend driving a little farther for good dimsum in the Asian plaza. Peace.",

We've been here at least six times on different days and different times. The lastest visit was on a fairly warm October afternoon. The best time to come is Sunday before 3pm because even though it's crazy busy they have the best selection, more carts and fresher offerings. When we arrived it wasn't busy, maybe six tables max. It was really warm and humid in there, I could see they had some box fans but didn't feel like any AC was on. I was wearing a thin t shirt and shorts, but was still feeling some perspiration :(  NOTE TO NEWBIES: familiarize yourself with the picture menu and prices, it's easy to get over zealous and pick out a bunch of stuff not knowing some are $7 a pop!",

    "text": "We were heading down to Vegas for two nights. I asked dad if there was any place that he wanted to visit or restaurant that he wanted to eat at. True to nature, he wanted Chinese food for lunch, specifically dim sum. There was a restaurant that they had eaten at four years ago and \"the people were really nice\" and \"the food really good\" but \"I can't remember the name of it\", something with the name Orchid in it.  No problem said Son #1 (that's me). I'll just punch in Orchid in Las Vegas, Nv and see what Yelp comes up with. Oh, could it be Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant? Yes? No? Maybe? Look, here are some pictures to look at. Oh? That's the one. Terrific!  Naturally, when I pulled into the parking lot, the voice from the back seat goes, \"where are we? We've never been here before!\" Argggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!  So we bravely trooped into the restaurant anyway. We were greeted and seated relatively quickly. I ordered the type of tea that I like (Gook Bo, which is a blend of Gook Fah and Bo Li). It was actually pretty decent. The steam carts came around as well as women carrying small trays of food. Pretty much, a typical dim sum scene.  We don't recall seeing anything \"new\" or \"unusual\". Mostly the standard fare. We did notice that the portions were smaller than we were used to seeing. Flavors were okay but nothing really stood out. We had all the \"standards\" except we didn't order any buns.  Har gow (shrimp dumpling), shui mai  (pork & shrimp dumpling), pi gwat (pork spare ribs), fung jow (chicken feet), naw mei fan (sticky rice tamale), ngow een (beef meatball), hom sui gok (deep fried meat dumpling) and many more.  Service was okay but I think we confused the servers as we always tend to. They look at the parents and start to speak Cantonese and then they look at me and my wife and switch to English or Chinglish depending on their proficiency.  I'd say that if you're in Vegas and must have dim sum, you could do worse but don't expect the same quality that you'd find in Alhambra, Montereay Park or San Francisco.",

I'm from SoCal and I've been to soooo many different places and different restaurant to eat dim sum: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, etc. But I have to say Orchids Garden is definitely one of the top dim sum restaurants that I have ever been to. There prices are reasonably and the proportions and good for the price we pay. The taste of the food is absolutely amazing and delicious. Full of flavor in every bite! I didn't get to try everything but I definitely got to try a lot of them that they served. I would say 80% of what we ordered, I enjoyed.   My favorites: - Steamed chicken feet  - Pork shiu mai (must try!) - Steamed beef balls - Steamed beef ribs  - Sweet tofu (the ginger doesn't overpower the sweetness flavor which I really like)  I would have given this place a 5 star but the service was horrible. The host gave me a number  and told us the wait was around 15 mins. After waiting for about 25-30 mins, we went to go check our number on the wait and the host completely forgot to write down our number before she gave it to us so she's been skipping us the entire time when we were right in front of her waiting for our table. Good thing we went up to her to check and she sat us immediately right after. After being seated, we waited another 15 mins and I got really upset so my friend and I had to get up and tell the lady cleaning the table next to us if she can bring us some carts because we've been waiting for so long. She was very understanding and went to go get a cart and we went crazy and got at least 8-10 dishes at once hahaha. Even though the service was bad, this place still deserves a good review. I honestly can't wait to come back to vegas and go eat here again!",

There was nothing that really ever stood out, positively or negatively, but sometimes dim sum is just calling my name, and this is where we go.    However, yesterday my family came to try the peking duck.  The last time I had peking duck was in Hong Kong, where the sizzling duck was carved at table side and the skin was perfectly crispy.  It was like candy.  Unfortunately, my experience at Orchids Garden was not on par.  Parts of the skin were still attached to the duck meat and only half of the pieces were crispy, while the others were limp and chewy.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy, although a little thicker than I prefer.  But, the addition of the plum sauce and the spring onions made me forget the disappointing duck skin.   I probably won't order it again, hence the search for delicious Peking Duck in Las Vegas continues.  This restaurant is quite clean, though.  Service is friendly, and where else can you get dim sum all day? So, I will definitely be back for that.",

Their har-gow is mediocre at best, but the shu-mai is still good! Service isn't amazing, but who expects great service in an Asian restaurant?! Lol  Their egg tarts were ok, and their mango pudding with condensed milk that my friend hyped up, wasn't that great.  Their pork buns are good too! I like them. I don't care for their fried rice, but I'm not a huge fried rice fan to start with.  I'll probably be back here, but it's not something you have to go out of your way to try.",

We continued to talk while finishing our waters, when the manager approached us. She said, \"we're waiting for this table?\". I said ?excuse me\", and she again replied, \"we're waiting on this table\". We were basically be pushed out as soon as they got our money. I have never in my life have been asked to wrap it up and leave. It was the rudest experience I have ever received from any restaurant.

It's a bit easier to go to sometimes than braving the craziness around Chinatown too; which is probably why I come here more often. I know a few of my friends have had a bit of difficulty ordering when they've come here but I haven't experienced that difficulty myself... Perhaps that's simply because my minimal Cantonese ONLY extends to ordering food. We often will just order take-out dim sum when we come here and usually that works out just as well. I've brought one large group here for Chinese New Year and it was easy and well organized. I think the three-star rating describes my feelings perfectly- A-OK.",

I've had dim sum from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Canada, Seattle and other areas and this place is not bad in comparison. Its tasty and price is reasonable. The only downside is with typical dim sum place is the queue when you arrive late. Be there at 10.30am and you will be served instantly. Arrive at 12pm and you may have to wait more than 30 min depending on the weekend. Since they serve dimsum all day long, I went and tried one time in the evening. You have to order from the menu, and the variety is not as good as the brunch. The taste is a bit off too, kind of expected. I recommend this place highly.",

First and foremost I want to make very clear that the servers or the cart ladies were very helpful and kind, the other employees however, and by that I mean the guys at the registers or taking drink orders were EXTREMELY rude. I literally do not understand what we did, we just came for dim sum, but these other employees treated and looked at us as though we were ready to run out the doors. First of all when we ordered our drinks from a lady, 4 waters and 1 Coke and she came back with just the waters. This wasn't a problem so we just asked another server and he went back grabbed the drink and slammed it on our table. Then as time went on they just kept walking by our table, literally every 5 minutes, different people every time like we were being watched they weren't picking up plates or asking us how we were or if we needed refills or anything just walking by staring us down while we ate our food. No one else had this kind of treatment, literally no one and there was a good 25-30 people in the restaurant. A little later though I saw one of them start talking to one of the cart ladies and suddenly they started avoiding our table all together, we had to wave them down just to pick what we wanted, and again I want to explicitly make sure that none of this were on the cart ladies, they were nothing but kind and helpful but the servers and cashiers were just so ready to just give us the check so we would leave. It wasn't busy, and whenever a new set of guests walked in they were treated way better.",

    "text": "Dim sum available all day is their ad which makes me somewhat apprehensive on such a claim.  I didn't try going there in the evening for their dim sum, but during lunch hours.  Pay attention as you walk in, look for their day's specials.  There were two boards listing different specials.  One of the offered steamed or crispy flounder USD 20.95, which caught my attention for a steamed flounder.  Order this first from a waitress, as it takes maybe twenty minutes before it arrives.  Meantime, select dim sum plates as the rolling carts roll by, select one or two at time, finish those before adding more, else it's real easy to order more than you may comfortably eat.  Tea is complimentary here and is decent quality tea without a head charge for tea per person as some dim sum houses do.  Advise to not select starchy dishes (I.e. buns, noodles) as that tends to fill you, leaving less room for more dim sum plates.  Grab the dim sum prior to sitting at at table if you're concerned with their dim sum pricing which are broken down six groups, getting the dim sum menu demystifies this.  The steamed flounder turned out delicious.  Don't be shy about defining the whole flounder.  It's easy, or ask the waitress to define it for you.  Use the large tablespoon, insert into either the head or tail so bottom of the spoon comes in contact with the top of the fish bone structure and the top of the spoon contacts the bottom of the fish flesh, separating the flesh from the bone structure, carefully sliding the spoon from one end of the fish to the other end.  Save the sauce served on the fish, take it home in a sealed container for liquids or come with a quart sized sealable plastic baggie.  It goes well poured over steamed rice, much better than soy sauce, in my humbled opinion.  Dim sum personal favorites:  pan fried daikon cake A USD 2.25; steamed pork spareribs B USD 3; pan fried chive dumpling B USD 3; bean curd skin sheet roll B USD 3; baked egg tart B USD 3; pork siu mai B USD 3; shrimp har gow (has a nice thin translucent skin) B USD 3; shrimp paste in bell pepper B USD 3; shark fin dumpling B USD 3; sticky rice in lotus leaf C USD 4.1; deep fried taro C USD 4.1; salt and pepper calamari E USD 6.1.  Items that I wouldn't recommend here:  mango pudding B USD 3 tasted totally artificial with a gelatin consultancy and request milk added.  I've tasted better elsewhere.  Roast duck, didn't try try it, looked not very good.  Prices may change, credit cards accepted.  We saw custard tarts rolled by multiple times, but by the time I decided to order a plate, they were finished for the day on that dish which was around 1430 hours.  So if they out of that one dish, what else would they be out of by the time they close at 2230 hours?  If you want dim sum, come by 1330 hours at the latest.",

All my favorite dishes were available as well as some special dishes.  Eggplant shrimp and shrimpballs on bamboo stalk were my favorite.  Enjoyed the Chinese broccoli too, not available where i live.  Service was good and prices were reasonable. I would not hesitate to bring my Chinese parents here, and they know their dim sum.  Coming from Vancouver Canada, my Chinese food standards are pretty high.  Picked the orchid because of the yelp reviews and was not disappointed.",

Back home we only have dim sum during lunch hours, they are always crazy busy, and all of them are located in town.    We've never had to wait for a seat here, as their dining area is huge.  They also have a pretty big parking lot, so no problem there either.  They are quick with drinks and there are always ladies walking around with the carts, you never have to wait long for what you want.  If you don't see what you're looking for, just flag someone down and order it.  Everything we get is yums and the prices are very decent.",

    "text": "I've never tried the menu food - I eat Dim Sum here every couple of months, and I thoroughly enjoy it. The steamed pork buns are my personal favorite, and the friend that usually goes with me likes the Shu Mai and the shrimp noodles. Prices are great, the cart rolls around frequently, and the food is always fresh whether the place is busy or not. The spare ribs are a bit fatty and greasy, and the one time I tried the fried squid, it was fairly chewy and a little oily, but everything else is delicious. The sesame balls are especially tasty!  While I've never tried to split a check here, I can imagine it would be problematic since Dim Sum by nature is food to be shared, and they just punch the card at your table when you ask for a dish. I guess if you really want to split a check they probably will, but if you're trying to keep your order separate from other people at the table, you might have trouble with it.  Love the authentic Chinese dishes, too. Definitely check it out. It's a great place for lunch or dinner.",

We waited about an hour the first time and about 35 minutes the second time.    Overall, I thought the dim sum was just ok.  I've had much better in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Actually, I think that the dim sum at Chang's (Vegas) is better too.    Price is about the same as Chang's.  Portions seemed to be slightly smaller.  However, the service at Orchids is much better than Chang's.  When you ask for something at Orchids, it comes right away.  Whereas, we have waited 15 minutes for our check at Chang's.  I just wish the dim sum was better at Orchids in both the size and taste.  Xie Xie!",

As soon as you get seated, the dimsum carts are soon to flock to your table with streaming little baskets! The dimsum is good but I think seeing every table ordering tons of those little baskets make me want to order everything. Very reasonable prices. Orders are at $3.50/ basket on the average. My personal faves are siomai and shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns (the best I've tried in Vegas), tendon, sharks fin. The sesame balls are really crisp fresh and well stuffed. The tofu desert with syrup is good but on the gingery side.  They also have a large carte menu but I never really bothered so I can't say comment on that.  Try not to come on an off time or not a busy time, the dimsum may not be as fresh.  The chairs and tables are on the sticky side and restroom smells a Lil funky.",

It's a traditional style dim sum place which they come around in carts. You point or ask for certain dishes, they put the dish on the table, stamp on your bill card. I like how it's straightforward and no bs. You may feel some of the ladies with the carts are rude, but they probably don't mean to.  Everything tasted really good. We especially liked the chive dumplings with shrimp, deep fried meat ball, and tofu soup. My all time favorite dim sum dish is the shrimp with rice noodle. Unfortunately, the shrimp wasn't as big as I'm used to, but I really like the rice noodle so would order this again when I'm back.  Also, the tea was complimentary, just like we like it.  I also liked how they had a lot of windows and was bright inside. The tables and seats felt nice too.  Our bill was around $65 with tip for the 4 of us! Pretty good deal! We were very full and ended up taking some home.  Would definitely come back again.",

The dim sum itself was fairly decent with a good variety of dishes. The quality was perhaps not to the level of some of the best places I've had in California, but it was great for Vegas. Prices were typical I would say.  Service was adequate, dim sum servers are usually fairly no-nonsense. The interior was large and looked like a standard Cantonese restaurant.  Solid dim sum place for sure.",

We ask for a round of water and hot tea. Then here comes the cart. This place serves dim sum all day which I thought was very interesting but at least when i crave for dim sum in odd hours i know where to go. We started with an array of foods...like their chow mein x4, shrimp dumplings, shu mai x4, beef tendons x2, lup cheong in steam buns x5, Chinese brocolli x3, fried chives, fried shrimp balls, chicken feet, seafood bean curd, shrimp fried rice x2, fried taro, roast duck, calamari x2, mango pudding, rice cakes x3 and so on. I can honestly say by far it is way better than Dim sum cafe in hualapai. The staff was nice and attentive, and no pressure in ordering foods. The food was flavorful and not bland.   Most definitely we will be back here. I deducted a star because I'm still on a mission who has the best dim sum in Vegas. So far, this is on the top of my list. Happy eats!",

I've been here many times and no, you do not come here for service, but you will get offered food quickly and they do have most dim sum items you can get at most dim sum locations.   We always get xiao mai, har gow, shrimp chow fun, the pan fried rice rolls with XO sauce, spare ribs, chive dumplings, and chicken feet. We usually keep our chill with the fried foods but I am a big fan of the fried footballs stuffed with meat and the fried crab claw with the mayo sauce.   It's always busy, however, they are extremely efficient and the table turnover is quick! It's about $15 a person. It's not SGV or the Bay but the quality is still good and fulfills my cravings when I have them.   Another plus is they do dim sum all day and have some cool specials that I hope to try in the future.",

Upon walking in, we saw the specials board near the front door. On there it stated that they had crab claws on special. But we came for dim sum and not for anything else. So, we started ordering from the dim sum carts as they walked.   We decided that we wanted to try the crab claws. So we asked for the menu. And after going through about 3 different servers, since none of them spoke English, we finally got one who did. When we asked for the crab claws he said that it was on the dim sum cart. So when the cart came by he pointed them out to us.   At this point we decided against them because this was something they always have.  Thus, it really wasn't on \"special\".   This upset the dim sum cart lady so much that she started yelling in Chinese to her colleagues which was obviously about us.    AND, everytime she walked by each time after that she wouldn't come near us but she would give us dirty looks.   This experience, coupled with the last time, will most definitely prevent me from going back.",

They come around with carts and offer a lot of different Chinese options- sticky buns, low main noodles, coconut buns, rice, and some desserts. Lots of shrimp and pork options. Overall I would go back with my family as we aren't picky eaters but this is nothing like a regular Chinese restaurant so I know picky eaters wouldn't enjoy the cuisine here(my husband falls in that category).   The loss of one star for little things; You have to ask for straws, spoons, and knives- only forks and napkins as you're seated. It's hard to understand those that push the carts around table to table, it would be soooo great if they implemented sign on the carts so everyone could read what they're offering instead of saying \"sorry, what?\" many times before understanding what they say.  It's nice that as soon as you're seated you can get food immediately!!!! The staff was all friendly and happy which is a nice touch on a great lunch!!",

Though some dishes are especially oily, it's mostly satisfying. They also have some of their entrees served in small portions on their dim sum carts. You don't even need to look at a menu. Always wash it down with hot tea!",

    "text": "Let's be honest: Is this my favorite dim sum place? No.  Is this the dim sum place I most frequent? Yes!  When it comes to dim sum, I have a specific set of items that I order. I love shrimp. If it has shrimp in it, I must have it. When it comes to dim sum, my husband has a specific set of items that he orders. He hates fish. Loves meat. If it doesn't have fish, and just meat, he must have it. Could I tell you the exact name of our favorites? No clue - but I could describe it: shrimp dumplings, some shrimp dumpling with green stuff in it (chives maybe?), shrimp ball with a sugar cane in it, har gow (I goggled this so that IS the actual name). For my hubs, he loooooooves the BBQ pork buns and the sticky pork buns!  Needless to say, we do not share what we order and after coming to Orchids Garden  over 4 times, we have the place down to a science.  #1 Come early. I have never been to this place on a week day and I have never been to the place over an hour from it's opening time. I read the reviews of the place, and I immediately learned that I don't think I would enjoy it as much in the middle of the week or for a late lunch. I have already noticed the difference between their Sunday service and their Saturday and have learned from friends' experiences - Sunday morning is the best time to go.  #2 don't order anything from a person who's cart is almost empty. The cart ladies work hard and if most of the stuff is gone from the cart, it's safe to assume that they've been around the block a few times. I have made the mistake and had lukewarm shrimp balls and no- they are not good.  #3 A friend of mine had said they had a bad experience because almost every minute someone stopped by their table with cart asking if they wanted something. I think he was complaining that it was hard to have a conversation when they were being interrupted repeatedly. My advice to my friend was - don't go to dim sum then. Dim sum is all about the food. In my opinion, the expectations should be a variety of hot food readily available to you when you sit down. It's not about how friendly the lady pushing the cart is, or how many times you were bothered after you were clearly full.  I am a regular at Orchids Garden because of it's easy-to-get-to location, consistency of food quality, and most of all - the price. Plus, our water glasses are always full, the bathrooms are clean, and we never have to wait to get our bill.  While there are plenty of great dim sum places around town (Ping Pang Pong to name one), Orchids Gardens is my go to spot for early afternoon cravings. It hasn't let me down once.",

We had just experienced a dim sum restaurant in San Francisco that only served dim sum for lunch and we were expecting to have it for dinner. We were all first timers to Orchids Garden and have all decided... yes, we will be returning!  We came on weekday evening around 6:30. There was no wait and were seated immediately. The dining area was huge... we couldn't even imagine what it's like on a busy night. Aside from our table, there were maybe 3 other tables that were occupied. Once 7:00 rolled around, people started coming in.  We came at a really good time.  We devoured 21 dishes between the 4 of us. I don't know if that's average or excessive, but we were pretty hungry.  :P The food was a little on the salty side (for me, but no one else... some, not all) and the women behind the carts were a little pushy (which we expected from reading all the reviews), but still friendly.",

Prices are a little higher than in the city where there are more ds options, but that's expected.  Mad props for serving all day dim sum, although not everything on the carts is piping hot if you come during an off time.  They have all the staples here, but you sometimes have to ask if you don't see your favs on the carts.  Shrimp puffs w/ scallions, sesame balls, shu mai, & sugar cane shrimp are some of my favs.  Delicious sweet cream buns (aka pineapple buns), worth the trip alone if you get them hot.  Love that they have noodles on the carts so that less adventurous eaters have a staple they don't need to order off the menu and wait for.  There always seems to be someone in my group who is super grateful for those noodles!  Definitely my go-to spot for dim sum, but I'd recommend coming during prime time (usually 11am on weekends and lunch or din time during the week) for the freshest selection, otherwise your experience might be more of a 2 or 3 star scenario.",

The staff is very friendly even though some of the cart ladies don't have the best English we communicate very well. We went to Dim Sum today at about 12:30 and the place was packed (to me that is a good sign, do you really want to go to a restaurant that is empty? Doesn't that say something about their food?) We were a party of two so we didn't have to wait long. Normally I don't like sitting so close to the Kitchen but today I didn't mind, we got first picks of the fresh stuff right out of the kitchen! Not that any of the food would be cold or old, there were way too many people for that. All in all this was my best Dim Sum visit ever and I can't wait to go back, I might have to make it an after paycheck day tradition.",

That's like going to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve enchiladas or tacos.  I was totally disappointed. The dishes were not hot- a no no for Asian restaurant.

It was around 9:30 PM and the place was pretty empty except for a couple of other people, but they still had carts to bring around, which surprised me because most dim sum places will just serve when items are ordered. The food tasted amazing, full of flavor, and definitely not a disappointment. The ladies that worked their were very nice as well. I'll be sure to come visit again for sure the next time I'm in Vegas.",

This might b a vague review , I'm sorry but most of the dim sum we ordered I have no idea what the nameswere, just point at what looks good and hope it's not offals.            The char siu bao both steamed and baked very good , the fillings in both were perfect both flavor and texture.           They had alot of shrimp dishes , shrimp stuffed eggplant, tofu and in sheet noodles. We also had the shrimp ball on sugar cane.  The lotus leaf wrapped rice w/ pork was tasty . Mom loved the turnip cake I think that's what it was.. We had alot of other dim sum that were very good , in general everything tasted good .                Service was good, not as pushy as other yelpers experienced, carts came around quickly. We really enjoyed ourselves , i don't think u can go wrong here , we've been here maybe a dozen times and we still come back .",

The ladies that work the carts of food around the restaurant are friendly and helpful, even though they are persistent in trying to get you to buy more.  I usually eat dim sum in Westminster at Seafood Cove (previously Dragon Phoenix).  This place's dim sum was better, in my opinion.  Not as salty and leaving you parched for lots of water as Seafood Cove.  All in all, a great place to eat with family while in Vegas.  We order a lot of dishes and were completely stuffed.

We particularly love menu items like the House Special pan fried noodles, the almond shrimp, steamed ginger chicken and the steamed fish. Mrs. Wong, who owns the place, runs a tight ship and is on hand pretty much of the time to greet customers and make sure everyone is given the very best of service and food. When my dad died, this past year, nearly the entire staff expressed their condolences and when my wife and I go there now, they greet us like their own family and bring our favorite dim sum to the table. We'll be sticking with Orchids Garden as our Chinese restaurant of choice. Five stars!!!",

After looking through the menu my friend had some questions about a few of the menu choices he was interested in ordering, so he proceeded to ask one of the women he saw coming towards our table, \"what does this dish come with exactly?\" was the only thing he asked, the woman replied \"oh you won't like that its too Chinese for you!\" Disgusted by her response my friend ordered general tso chicken instead, he then ordered a glass of water which took a long time. later into dinner I got a second order of the crab claw dumpling and after taking my first bite I noticed there was a hair on it. The whole time I felt as if they were rushing us out and didn't want us there! The food wasn't bad but the less than stellar service and the attitudes of the staff overshadowed everything else!

We came in a group of 8, so I got to try a lot of different items. I was a bit disappointed that the radish cakes didn't come out hot and freshly fried. Some of he dishes had been microwaved, and even had Saran Wrap over the plate, which they removed only after you pick it.   The wait was only 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11am, so I think that's pretty good. I'm not sure if there was a standout item for me. Oh, the chives dumplings that are round and flat were my favorite.   Food comes out quick. We were bunch of fatties with eyes bigger than our stomach, so by the end, htere was enough leftover to create a combo dim sum meal for dinner.   The price came out to $28/pp after tax and tip. I believe gratuity was included as we were a party of 8. Never seen a $240 bill at dim sum before, but there's always a first for everything.

    "text": "I'm just not a huge fan of this place. Dim sum is fine, but after each of the three times I've been here, I've had a stomachache and slight nausea afterwards. Food is kinda greasy/oily even for dim sum! I've had my fair share of dimsum, and don't get me wrong, I love me some msg & enough oil to make a dish taste good, but you don't have to overdo it to the point of feeling discomfort afterwards.   It's loud, there's always a wait regardless of the time of day, and good luck getting any kind of minimal service here (& I'm not expecting much service at dimsum anyways). Last time I was here, a server lady poured soy sauce on a dish from three feet up (slight exaggeration but hardly). It splashed up from the plate (duh), but there was no change in behavior from server or apology for her actions.   However, having said all the above, if you're craving dim sum, this is the place to satisfy it, sadly.   Side rant: Can we start a petition to get rid of the loud banquet hall style Chinese restaurants? Like some quieter ones where diners don't have to shout to each other to be heard would be awesome.",

This place serves dim sum all day and there was no wait around 2 o'clock on a Saturday. The place is pretty big nice. As for dim sum they have all the staples like shrimp dumpling, Siu Mai, chicken feet and pork spare ribs. They were good and satisfying. Portions are on the smaller side though. I didn't see a lot of new or exciting dim sum... All just the regular stuff. We ordered and ate a lot. All in all we were satisfied but it wasn't amazing and it didn't blow our socks off. We ended up paying 14 per person with tip and tax so price was fare. Wasn't cheap. It it wasn't extravagantly expensive.  They didn't also have a lot of dim sum cart. Maybe three or four they would push around again and again.   Service is good. Except for when I tried to flag this lady down for the check she just kept looking at me... Kind of weird.   Would go back again until I find a better place :).",

I feel as though everything is reasonably priced, and I can't say I didn't enjoy every dish that we picked out!

Figured, great we'll get out of here pretty quick since these guys are pretty good.   Well..They never came back to our table. We got our round of dim sum and fried rice and that was it. Our water cups were empty, nobody came to check up on us nor asked if we needed anything. I had to stop one of them on their way of passing us to get to another table for a small box. Usually they get us a printed check after we're done, didn't get anything this time. Keep in mind, they were slow. Maybe 6 tables, TOPS. We had to take it to the front and the lady up there was so rude I swear she shouldn't be in customer service. Her facial expressions screams \"LEAVE\". I asked for change so I can leave tip, she took my money, rolled her eyes, and set my money down on the register without saying anything.   This is the last we will step foot in there. Time to find a new dim sum place. I don't mind paying more for better customer service.",

However atmosphere wasn't that great, very loud and super crowded inside so I was hoping it was busy for a good reason.  Dim sum selection was decent, less variety of choices compare to similar restaurants in the area. Not enough serving carts with all items. Gotta wait quite a bit for them to come around, definitely not easy to get all your food at once. Food looked presentable but totally lacked of flavors. Some items were very salty, way too oily or not hot enough. Only a few dishes were average, the rest was sadly disappointing.  Extremely slow and inattentive service. The employees weren't really friendly. They seemed careless, annoyed and unhappy entire time. Don't be surprised if you'll get ignored there. Don't be shocked if they'll suddenly disappear and never come back to your table after being seated. I just wish the food was at least delicious if the service sucked.",

    "text": "I really wanted to write a great review, I really did. But there are just ways you should not be treating a customer!  Let me explain. My family and I were going on our annual family trip and were all meeting in Las Vegas for the day before going to our next destination. As the rest of our family arrived, we all decided to have dim sum for lunch. We had a party totaling 11 people and the first 7 people arrived, got our table, and told the ladies that they were waiting for the rest of their party before taking dim sum plates.  In this environment, you have older ladies pushing around dim sum carts and you just ask them what you want from their cart and they give it to you. Simple. But every time a lady came by and offered dim sum, my family had to reiterate that they were waiting for the rest of their party. By the time the rest of us got there (only 5 minutes after), the ladies at the carts were so rude to us! There were a couple of ladies in particular who would intentionally help the tables next to us and then push right on by without stopping at our table. A couple of other ladies would get easily aggravated with our party when some of us were trying to decide what we wanted to eat!   At one point, one lady literally THREW out dim sum plate on the table. and that was NOT okay. I usually can look past the yelling and some of your ladies ignoring us (let me also say, not all the ladies were mean. There were a few nice ladies as well), but throwing the plate down? That is honestly unacceptable. The manager had to come by and apologize for her on multiple occasions because she was also one of the people who would just push her cart past us, even when we try to flag her down.   Besides the experience, the food was okay, which is why I gave two stars. The chicken feet and the shumai were my personal favorite.  Overall, delicious place to eat at as long as you don't piss off their workers in some way, shape, or form, even though you did nothing wrong.",

Ordered some stuff to go: shu mai (pork dumpling), har gow (shrimp dumpling), bok tun gow (sweet rice cake), shrimp rice noodle, steamed bun with Chinese sausage, and daan tat. Unfortunately I was told after I ordered that they were out of daan tat. I switched to an order of chow mein and received the change back to cover the difference. The prices were decent although I felt for the amount of chow mein the $6.95 was a little steep. Everything was delicious. The chow mein wasn't my favorite, but other than that I was very happy with my order. I would definitely go back especially knowing I could go at any time and parking is easy!",

The feet were cooked well... nicely seasoned, tender, and plump ...and not too spicy!  We also got custard tarts (don tot), shrimp dumplings (ha gow), Chinese broccoli, Chive dumplings, stuffed eggplant, savory gin dui (hom sui gok aka fried mochi filled with cha siu), fried taro (taro gok), baked cha siu bao, and pork dumplings (siu mai).  Service was satisfactory! When we asked for each item to be cut in half, the servers were well equipped with scissors! Our used dishes were cleared away promptly. Our water glasses were filled before we asked!  This is a very spacious restaurant with a convenient restroom and free parking!  I wouldn't mind returning!",

Afterwards went to be seated, and the hostess was clearly bored, showing little interest in my arrival (a smile might have helped) as I was led to a table.  All in all, not a good start.    After I sat down the dim sum cart came by and I ordered the pan fried chive dumpling, an english speaking person appeared conveying my order; I also ordered the the Pepper Steak, a la carte.  The Pepper Steak promptly appeared and it was good, portion reasonable, the pan fried chive dumpling appeared after I finished my pepper steak (?), I had assumed that order had fallen through a crack...   ...all in all, the dumpling was more interesting than the pepper steak. If I would ever return, I'd probably just order off the dim sum menu.  All in all, not likely I'll return, just not memorable, staff showed little enthusiasm, and if they aren't excited re what they're serving, why should I?    As I reflect back on my visit, the lack of personality weighed heavy on my visit (rather felt like I was in a cafeteria, bland of personality), even though I thought the food was decent, and the dumpling in particular, interesting.  Piks attached of each.",

They are quick here. There were a lot of people per usual on a Sunday late morning. However, we (five of us) got seated in about 15-20minutes. That's pretty fast I would say. We ordered many items from chicken feet, spare ribs, taro cakes, shrimp shumai, crab ball, pork bun, fried rice, and on and on. Each item, was delicious. I was curious about other items however of course it depended on what the group wanted. This place has quite the variety of items to choose from.   You can also order from their menu. I've only ever ordered a fried rice combo here. I'd like to try their other entrees sometime, maybe for dinner.   For the 5 of us and the multitude of food items we got, we ended up with a bill of $115. It wasnt terrible considering how good the food was and how prompt their service was. We didn't have to wait too long for water refills either! haha.   I'll be back!",

My personal favorites here are the soup dumplings and barbeque pork buns. The soup dumplings are cooked to order and usually take about 10 to 15 minutes to come out. They are definitely worth the wait though! It is like a bite-sized wonton soup. The barbeque pork buns are sticky, sweet, and savory at the same time! In each bite, you get some sweet and sticky bread, and sweet and savory meat. You will never get a bite without the meat or the bun. Their barbeque pork fried rice is amazing as well! It is salty and sweet. The rice is salty while the meat is nice and sweet. I would definitely recommend this place for you if you feel like having some delicious dim sum.",

Don't think he knew what the names were just point and say one of those, two of that and so on! Everything he ordered was good. Pork hash, siu mai, shrimp ball, crab ball, look fun, char siu bao, noodles and a bunch of other dishes.   I don't think you could go wrong with any of the choices. Carts came by fast and weren't pushy at all.   You can tell this place is good when you look around and see a lot of Chinese customers.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I didn't get to eat anything here today. My plan today was to get some dim sum for the first time. I had read reviews about it here and though the Orchids Garden would be my first time Dim sum experience. I read that they had takeout and thought \"that's great!\". So I went in today around 1:30pm to order some. This is where it started to turn sour for me. When I entered I asked the four waitresses waiting at the register if they had takeout. One waitress automatically pointed at the stack of menu's at the other end of the counter. My thoughts were \"OK, there are four of you, one is handling some customers paying for her food and the others are just standing there. Couldn't one of them just hand me a menu instead of me just having to make a wide berth around the customers to grab one?\".    I didn't say anything but just went went around the other customers and got the menu they pointed out. The menu was for regular Chinese food that I could get anywhere with those prices. There was no dim sum listed. I remembered from reading about this restaurant on Yelp that they must have a dim sum menu. There were no dim sum menu's around the counter, and I didn't get a chance to ask because the same counter people (whom were still just standing there not doing anything) were still focused on the customer they were billing. I'm sure if I waved a brightly colored flag they still wouldn't see me. So I just left, paper menu still in hand.  I really don't know if I'll go back there.  I may just have my Dim Sum experience someplace else. Two stars to this place for at least getting in and seeing the menu.",

Seems to have caught on with many other people, as the clientelle today was a huge mix of people: Asians of all types, Hawaiians, and Caucasians. Don't even come here on a holiday weekend as you will wait for about 30-45 minutes (we did that once- we won't make that mistake again).  It's still yummy! We had the chinese broccoli (steamed just right), sio mai, shrimp balls (mmm, another favorite), shrimp on the sugar cane (one of my hubby's favorites), pork buns (another hubby's favorite), egg tarts (one of my favorites, but then I saw the sesame balls... darn), and rice cakes (love this!). I had the hot tea (good stuff, so fragrant) while he had water. We didn't finish everything- we had leftovers. Less than $26.00 plus tip. Maybe next time we won't wait so long, to come again.  (BTW, there's way more other dishes (noodles, chicken feet, tripe, rice, wide noodles with shrimp, soup, etc.) that they have- the ones that we get, just happens to be our favorites.)   The service is very good. We were seated right away, maybe because were just a party of two. The server brought us drinks right away (and refills too). Although, very busy, the servers are pretty quick, pushing the heavy food-filled carts to every table in the restaurant. Some of them speak english, some do not. If you're not clear (repeat yourself) you might get another dish by mistake. They stamp your card accordingly after you make your selections. When you have empty plates or containers on your table, someone comes over and grabs them.   There are two sections to the restaurant. A bathroom is located in the lobby. There are TVs all around, but because there are so many diners, you only just see the screens and can't hear them. But that's ok, because you're in the company of good eats!   This place has been around for years; the name might have changed a few times, but the food is still top notch. Definitely still The place for Dim Sum. I'm getting the sesame balls next time instead of the egg tarts.",

I spent about $40, on 7 different items from the carts and 2 ice teas. i got: -chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (nice serving) -shu mai (4 pieces) - shrimp dumpling (4 pieces) - pork bun (2 pieces) -shrimp ball (2 pieces) -custard pastry of some sort that reminded me of mini custard pie.(2 pieces) -shrimp cake on green pepper  I will probably have to try during the day maybe the food will be warmer next time =)",

It's a dim sum place that serves everything like you would find on the streets of Hong Kong.  These carts come around with steamed dim sum and you choose what you want, as much of it as you want.  They also have a regular menu for those who shy away from cart food or dim sum altogether.  I tried their menu and it's decent but isn't the best I've had.  Overall, great place for some good eats when you're on a time crunch and want some dumplings.  I like it, and it's very popular, but unfortunately I cannot say that I'm a fan nor is it as good as it gets.    To be honest, I like the shumai at Noodle No. 9 in Caesar's Palace, but for any other type of dim sum this restaurant has it.  You want dim sum?  Try here.  It's fun dining!",

However, once we were seated, things started to roll rather quickly. They asked what kind of tea we wanted and it was brought out really fast. The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.  The har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.  Like what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy. However, pee before you leave your hotel and go early so you don't have a wait -- avoid having to go to the bathroom at all and you'll have a good meal. Very cheap dim sum I'd say!",

They were recently shut down by the health department because they had so many violations. For some reason, we thought it was safe to go back. What a mistake!  I asked for a fork and the waitress dropped it on the floor and then handed it to me. When I told her I wanted a new one, I could tell she was bothered by the fact that I didn't want that one. She walked away and then brought me back the same exact fork! I saw that she didn't switch it out. My sister's water cup had lipstick on it (not hers), we saw them handle food with bare hands, on and on.

    "text": "When I want some dim sum, it's sometimes a dim prospect, especially if you're not in SF Bay, LA, or NYC Chinatown. Good dim sum in Vegas?  Heck yeah. I really like this place.  Dim sum can be bad if it's not fresh. But it is good here. A warning - you should get there before 1:30 or the number of dim sum carts hawked by their cart ladies declines after the peak of lunch.  They do advertise \"dim sum all day\".  So, you can order it on the phone or in person, and all of your stuff will come out freshly steamed or baked.  They do not take dim sum from the cart ladies for to go orders.   This is a free standing building off Sahara west of Eyeglass World. The decor and ambiance isn't something you'd wow about.  The bathrooms aren't the cleanest, and the parking during peak times (noon - 1 PM) can be a challenge.  But overall, it was a nice place to be when you want some dim sum as well as traditional Chinese food.  A lot of first time customers get a puzzled look when they cart ladies come by, but often by the end of their meal, they're hooked.    I don't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things our group loved.  We tried/shared all the different types of siu mai, egg rolls, har gow and  pork bun (steamed, baked).  Loved that gai lan, and enjoyed the porridge. We had their fried fish, noodles, and some desserts like custard pie, sweet rice cakes, sesame balls, and I forget the rest. We went  a1:15 PM so the stuff was pretty fresh and the little carts were still darting through the restaurant. Some of the ladies were hard to understand but it didn't matter as long as you could see what she had in her cart. We took what we didn't finish home.  But except for the desserts, they tasted much better in the restaurant.  Lucky for me being a sweet tooth, they made for a great after dinner snack.  Yummy  It's a hassle from where in OC I live to get to the decent dim sum places in LA county.  How I miss living in the SF Bay area where dim sum places in Oakland and SF Chinatown are plentiful and yummy.  But when visiting my relatives in Vegas, this is an excellent choice. Each plate of dim sum was about $2 each, plus or minus some change.",

    "text": "The food is really fantastic, chive dumplings and char siu bao and shu mai were _amazing_. The shrimp was juicy and had that authentic snappiness to it, everything was well cooked and not unnecessarily greasy (as Chinese food inherently is...) The egg custards were so good we ordered a second round of them instead of trying something else, they're pretty much flan in a pie shell.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced - a huge dinner for 3 only ran us 50$ with drinks - and the menu on their site does have correct prices even though the first page says it's out of date. The few things we wanted that weren't visible on the carts when they came by (roast duck and mango pudding), all we had to do was ask the cart pusher lady  and she came back swiftly with them.   Caveat: There is definitely a slight language barrier and a big cultural barrier here. The lower reviews that I saw claim the service is bad, the staff is unfriendly, etc but those people are too ethnocentric to even fathom that service has different meanings in different cultures. Yes, by American sugar-sweet service standards they are brusque and short and strictly businesslike but this place is MUCH more friendly and 'Americanized' service-wise than most more-authentic Chinese places I've been to. Anyone who feels they were treated rudely probably just can't fathom that anything that isn't bowing at their feet is directly attacking them.   Disclaimer: this is the first and only dim sum restaurant I've been to. Maybe it's not on par compared to places in California as other reviewers have posted, but I don't live in Cali and 7 hours is a bit of a trip to make for dinner, so ;)",

I found them a tad sweet. The steamed chive dumplings were wonderfully savory. I found the calamari a bit greasy and off putting. The duck was tender, but not outstanding. The skin lacked that extra crisp texture. The shumai were fantastic.   Perhaps I'm being elitist, but I don't understand how any restaurant worth it's salt can't have fresh ground pepper.  Look for the full, hot, steaming carts. Few items=old and cold.  The service was what you would expect for dim sum. If you're looking for something more than descriptive, go elsewhere. The service is fast and the food is plentiful. Don't be afraid to say no, or you'll risk over ordering.  Definitely a place I'll check out again.",

Called for lunch reservations at a friend's recommendation, then took a taxi over. Didn't wait long for our table. The Saturday we were there, the main dining room was chock full of families, locals, and those who probably taxied over. (Yes, all good eats are off Strip.) Orchids Garden is ready for crowds: they have a large parking lot and a second high-capacity dining room purposed for lunch, dinner, and banquets.  We feasted on chicken feet, delicious green peppers with shrimp, tender tripe, tasty siu mai, pork buns, flour rice sheets, and fried shrimp balls wrapped about sugar canes - my favorite of the morning. Plates were strewn about, chopsticks flew. Servers constantly came by to clear our dishes and to ask if we wanted more food which was always appreciated. Drinks-wise, we skipped alcohol and sipped chrysanthemum and jasmine tea.  The bill was reasonable, especially split amongst friends. I'll be back!",

Unlike Cathy House, and other Chinese establishments in Las Vegas, the Dim Sum is prepared throughout the day, so you will get fresh, and not reheated, Dim Sum when the carts come around.  I always do the Dim Sum. My wife used to order Chinese entrees, until she finally realized they were not that good, and switched back to Dim Sum.   The place is large, and at lunch time, very loud. Dinner is a little less hectic.  Service is on the slow side. In the Asian tradition, don't be affraid to raise your voice to get service at your table, or they may ignore you.   They don't expect much of a tip, and don't appreciate a generous tip. Many of the Chinese patrons dont' tip; it's a cultural thing.   If you are on a date, and want to impress someone with your knowledge for \"off the strip\" or \"local\" places, or simply to introduce some one to Dim Sum, this is a decent bet.  If you are thinking of impressing someone with atmosphere, and deep conversation, go to Tao, a Rich Man's PF Chang's.",

    "text": "Another foray into the world of dim sum was at hand, and since Orchid Gardens was a place we've wanted to try for a long time, we decided to give it a try.  We came here for an early dinner, 4:30ish, so we figured we were either going to get the fresh stuff they began preparing for dinner, or the bottom-of-the-barrel leftover from the lunch crowd.  Well, either they continuously make them or we got the first dinner batch, because everything was fresh.    After the somewhat frustrating experience at Ping Pang Pong with not enough of what I wanted, I was not-so-secretly hoping the menu would be more to my liking.  I was not disappointed.  Plenty of shu mai, dumplings, and har gows to satisfy my cravings.  The pork and shrimp based pieces were fresh and tasty, with a couple of complaints;  1) the rice wrappings on the har gow and rice noodle rolls had too much flour-y taste to them, and 2) the rice noodle rolls had too much of the rice noodles for the amount of shrimp.  Not sure there should be flour taste in rice noodles...  But otherwise, the shu mais and dumplings were great, and the pimento stuffed with shrimp dim sum was fantastic.  And the sweet cream buns were yummy too.    Clean setting, fresh and mostly delish dim sums, and timeliness all add up to a satisfying experience.  Service is typically terse for dim sum joints, although there were spots of smiles and courtesy here and there.  We might also want to try some regular menus here, although I'm not sure how we'd resist the temptation of the rolling carts!  Table-for-1 Factor:  They also have regular Chinese menu here, but being that carts are rolling around all over and large groups abound, I don't know if you'd feel entirely comfortable sitting alone...",

I mean the service was ok but I just didn't like how she was having an attitude with me so I had another waitress help me put my food away and I tried to give her a tip but she told me just leave it on the bill which I did but the rude lady took the bill and saw how much it was which was $3 tip for her lol.   The food overall was satisfying and very delishes. I loved the dim sum so much especially when it just came out hot and fresh! Now my dad is realising he likes Chinese broccoli and likes the oyster sauce. But I'll be coming back and hopefully the service is better.",

So i leave the two pieces in the mini steamer bowl. I asked the lady (she has like a dora hair cut) if she can take it back she said, sorry but u order it i cant do anything. I was super disappointed it was really really gross, so i told my boyfriend this will be the first and last and i didnt left any tip coz i was so disgusted and she was very rude to us from the very beginning.",

They have all the usual dim sum items here -- but that fried taro dumpling is basically my litmus test for a good dim sum spot. At Orchids their dumpling was warm with a good ratio of filling-to-dough ratio, it wasn't too greasy or had that soaked up that nasty oil flavor from incorrect frying temperature, and still had that lovely crunch and flakiness on its outer layer.   Nothing to write home to mama about, its solid/on par for Vegas dim sum standards, 3.5 stars rounding up. It might be out of my way but it's still worth the drive when me and my guest(s) need to eat our way through a hangover in the morning. Like any other decent dim spot arrive early or expect to be waiting a while on the weekends.",

When I told our waitress I didn't eat pork, a few dumplings I ordered contained pork which they didn't tell me until after they made it and dropped it to my table.. I had to tell them twice I don't eat pork and the lady literally yelled at me & was speaking a different language to the other servers and YELLED in the kitchen. I'm not sure if she's the manager on duty or just a server, but when I tried ordering other options, her attitude was horrible &  she kept huffing, puffing & rolling her eyes that she was serving me or when I was asking questions.. I am a server & a bartender in 2 different restaurants so I KNOW how the industry is.. I just have to say that was the worst service I have ever gotten & I will NOT be back due to that woman..

I was excited at first and forced myself to like the food, but overall it was not a good experience and the staff was unfriendly. I got home and went straight to the bathroom. Never again.. you're better off going to the 168 market lol",

The dishes were some of the best we have had outside of China. We live in Henderson so we travel a ways to get here (worth the trip). The carts come by frequently so there is always something for everyone. We have found the staff more friendly as of late which was a wonderful surprise. If you love Dim Sum give this place a try.",

Lots of variety, everything tastes really good and fresh, and the prices very fair. I really like the shrimp and chive dumplings, the fried shrimp and crab balls, and the Chinese broccoli. Always gotta get that steams Chinese broccoli with the sauce. It's delicious and will make you feel better about your life somehow. People sometimes say their eyes are bigger than their stomach, but I think mine are pretty close. I've been here a handful of times and I think I've tried the majority of the menu. Good stuff. I would highly recommend this place.",

Don't mind the fact all the servers can speak English, how cool was that. Super oriental Chinese ambience!  Today I order mostly shrimp dish today, nonetheless everything superb 10/10 for food and service.   If you ever feeling dim-summy anytime of the day definitely check this out.

You can order the food at your own pace and try many different kinds of dishes. Just be careful! You might not even realize how much you eat haha! It was quite packed after 12pm but the employees quickly seated everyone. Here's a short summary of what we ate:  chicken feet was good. har gow was very good.  sticky rice filled with (i think was) pork was amazing. xiao long bao was not the best I've tried because there was hardly any soup.  Pork buns were ok but messy Deep fried fish was great and ended up ordering two",

The best time to eat here is in the mornings when they open up at 10:30am because the food is fresh off the stove and you have to try my favorite coconut bread. I also love the shrimp egg plant and the shrimp fried wonton. They serve dim sum for dinner all the way until closing 10:30pm however they run out of selection at the end of the day. It's great for big parties or families and they have super quick service. If you want to see the full review check out my YouTube video at Jens Vegas Reviews- Orchids Garden.",

They have your dim sum staples: BBQ pork buns, shumai, spare ribs, shrimp har gow, chicken feet, desserts etc. I love their Baked cream bun here though, I can eat them for days! They have a pretty good selection if you come earlier, as the day goes the variety dwindles down to just a few unappetizing plates. I find it to my advantage to call ahead of time to make sure they have my Baked buns and a few other choice items. They also have a sizeable menu to order ala carte from.  Prices are reasonable and in line with the quality. Coming here is entertaining for me as well, I crack up when the ladies pushing the carts practically shove food in your faces and are very assertive with pushy high pressure selling tactics hahaha.

You will find all the traditional Cantonese Dim Sum classics: har gow, siu mai, hum bao...aka shrimp balls, pork meatball, bbq pork bun. Everything you would expect to see at an old school Cantonese dim sum service - my favourites are stuffed eggplant and hom sui gok (\"footballs\"). The steam cart items could have been hotter, but I didn't think it was bad...  Orchids Garden is old school on several levels - you won't find carts very often in Vancouver BC, for instance, because they're serving HK or Taiwanese style - which is ordering on a menu. Also, the preparations are akin to old school diner classics. It is not \"elevated\". But it is oh-so-comforting. I really enjoyed it - it reminded me of dim sum with my grandparents.  Prices are on-point for this type of establishment - compared to Seattle, Vancouver BC and San Francisco. The dumplings are very standard sized. Our party of 6 massively over-ate and spent just under $100. That's A LOT of dim sum....literally my kids went through 6 orders of shrimp balls alone...so...",

We were in the middle of our meal and there were still plates with dim sum on the table.  Suddenly the waitress came by and took our plates and chopsticks away.  We suspected that they wanted to clean up the table and got rid of us since there were someone waiting to be seated.  Even though, we told her that we were not done and please gave us a few more minutes.  The waitress still came by many times within the next few minutes and tried to clean up EVERYTHING on the table.  She took my son's bowl while he was still eating from that particular bowl.  She also took our dim sum check along the way and did not care if we might order more.  We don't see why she could not leave us alone and gave us a few more minutes just to finish our meal  We were very dissatisfied with our last visit.  This restaurant made us felt very unwelcome.  We don't think we will go back again, even though we used to stop by each time we visited Vegas in the past.  I would give it 4 stars in the past when service was descent,  However, I must take away 3 stars after our bad experience just last week.",

This is a great place for dimsum. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from and their food quality has always been consistent. I have been going here for years. Overall experience is excellent and service is friendly considering that you have to use sign and body language to communicate with them.

    "text": "This place used to be good...we've been going for a few years. We overlooked that it was dirty because the food was cheap and good. We're Chinese and sadly expect a lot of good Chinese food places to be on the dirty side. Over the past 6 months, we've had really bad food experiences.We kept going back hoping it was going to get better again or maybe the last time was a bad fluke. After 5 more of these bad experiences, we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum. The service is typical rude Chinese, and I'm Chinese. Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the \"complainers\". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill. And if it tastes wierd, it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day.",

If you want something a little more \"weird\", try the chicken feet or the tripe. It's relatively clean and sanitary.

Crab claw balls were huge--the shrimp ball part was delicious, but the actual crab claw was tiny and crab meat wasn't good (tasted previously frozen) Deep fried shrimp dumplings were excellent, tasty/fresh/crisp. Gai lan was tender and delicious, but VERY small (both in terms of the size of the vegetable stalks and in quantity on the plate compared to any Bay Area dim sum house) Mango pudding was regular.",

Since we came for dim sum, we readied our plates with some hot oil and soy sauce. Then the feast on wheels.. .the waitresses were pushing out the metal hot carts. We selected quite a few dishes.

I don't really enjoy dim sum places where you order first from a piece of paper and then they bring it to you. Beats the fun in eating dim sum!

He picks out \"Chicken Feet,\" brave soul! Anyways the food is average, the portions are smaller than East Ocean and it's a little pricey.

I'm guessing because they offer dim sum all day, quality might not be as good as places that offer it at a limited time.   I usually don't experience a wait here and the carts come by my table pretty often which I like. The only time I waited, which wasn't too long, was when my fiance and I treated our mothers to a mother's day bunch. Not too shabby!    The biggest plus is that Orchids offers more variety selection of desserts than other dim sum places. (ie not just mango pudding and egg tarts but fruit tart, tofu, mango pudding and some sort of fruit cup)",

Off the Dim Sum cart we tried deep fried meat dumpling, steamed BBQ pork buns, pork Shiu Mai, coconut bun, and Chiu-Chow style dumplings. Thought maybe it was just the Dim Sum that wasn't that great, so decided to try a few dishes from the regular menu. The regular menu was a bit better. Tried the Moo Shu pork, Kung Pao beef with peanuts, and the dried scallop with egg whites fried rice. The regular menu is huge with many dishes to choose from. Very busy and popular restaurant.",

The complimentary soup was good and the vegetables were tasty.   However the biggest negative was the service. The waiters seemed like they didn't want the be there and looked like zombies. We had a 10% off coupon and when we showed it to our waiter, she told us to cut it out of the newspaper before they can take it. When they delivered the food to us, they didn't smile or seemed to acknowledge us. They just dropped off the food and left.  I would not recommend this restaurant based on the service we received. The food was good, but forgettable.",

    "text": "From NYC.  I've had my fair share of both \"authentic\" Chinese (Flushing, Chinatown, etc) and my fair share of \"takeout style.\"  But what on Earth is this?  I like new things/styles, but only if done right. This wasn't.   Let's begin: Upon entry, the smell of incense is present to mask the smell of urine pouring out the messy bathroom. Service was friendly, but incessant, to the point of annoying. 4 times within five minutes being asked if I want a refill on my Coke. I didn't. I'm on a diet. But I said yes, like tipping the ugly girl at a strip club so she goes away!  Now for the food. Where is the sauce?  The pork fried rice and chicken fried rice came out white. Looked steamed, not fried. Tasted bland as anything, flavored only by what tasted like a hint of butter. My wife's meal is traditionally served with a brown sauce (hoisin). However, there was nothing on it. Everything tasted boiled (in water) or steamed. I tried several Dim Sum dishes. The continual cart system was kinda neat, but many of the plates were indistinguishable from one another. Some were just gross, mushy, bland, \"mystery meat.\"  One or two pureed shrimp dim sum dishes were decent, not too fishy (shrimp toast style).  The place had no \"dumpling sauce,\" a staple in Chinese takeout where I'm from. It's essentially warm soy, ginger, and scallions, maybe some brown sugar. They did present me with vinegar instead. On my half of the continent, the Chinese vinegars are dark in color, similar to balsamic. This vinegar was pink, tasting like something you'd use to clean your shower.   Wontons were small with the very thin wrapper, halfheartedly twisted at the end as opposed to the kind that are closer to a thick, flavorful egg noodle, folded like a fortune cookie. They skimped on the soup contents, and I'm not sure why a wonton soup for one person is considered a half an order. What is this, Carmine's?    Menu was lacking some things we all like to see. If you google \"Chinese food menu\" you will not see anything similar to what they have here, that's a takeout style menu. However, some things I like to see in authentic cuisine were missing, as in \"braised pork shoulder.\"    Ever go to a foreign country and try a McDonalds and things just aren't \"right?\"  A comparable feeling at this place.  Some pleasantries were missing: tea automatically brought to table, crispy noodles with duck sauce,etc. However, I asked for noodles for my soup and got a crispy noodle style I had never experienced. It was really tasty.   They were friendly to my child, but I'll never visit again.",

The lady literally stood next to my niece like she was being escorted by a police officer!! I couldn't believe it!! My niece yelled at the lady and said \"can you hold on, can you not see we have infants in car seats?!!!\" The lady then replied, oh ok and walked away.   We had a party of 7 and 2 little newborns. Of course, we had to get ourself situated especially knowing we have little ones with us.   The front end had no  personality whatsoever!! They treated us the same way, didn't even apologized for what what just happened. All 3 just stared at us with no smile on their faces. After all that embarrassment, how are they going to expect you to pay and not give your receipt on return?!!! This was our first experience here and we will not be coming back.",

I leave the ordering to my husband who knows what most things are by sight but not by name.  I know which ones are my favorite and will tell him which ones to try again.  You can't go wrong with shrimp dumplings, roast pork rolls, deep fried taro fritter and anything with eggplant! We usually load up and eat ourselves silly before the third cart comes around!    This place serves plenty of fresh dim sum, has fast service and easy to get in if you come early!  But be warned, we have come just as the doors opened only to miss out on some of the choices when they get busier, so your timing to arrive will influence your choices, so slow to eat, take your time, and enjoy.",

The restaurant attract customers  because how the food taste but have limited employees as in limited in amount of employees and mind on how to better serve their patron.  ONLY If their services were great,  I do not mind tippling  minimum 20 percent of more.   Lol! This Restaurant have the nerve to charge automatic tip and had already attached 17 percent tip on my party because the restaurant  know they have bad customers services even though the waiter do not deserve it...

Weak tea and decent food. Sometimes the carts take forever to make it back to you but some carts seem to stop by every 5 minutes. It's always the ones we want that never seem to come around.  The service is pretty good though, and the hosts and cart ladies are always attentive and err on the friendly side, despite the fact that I am Chinese and cannot speak it (which is apparently a sin). Prices are also attractive, especially for a light lunch or for those who don't prefer to stuff themselves senseless.  Any dishes with noodles (such as the big fat ones with shrimp inside) are okay - not the softest but still satisfies my craving. Harkow and shumai is decent as well. I always like getting beef tendon, egg tarts, and this crispy fluffy taro bun.  I've never had to wait but the majority of tables in the wide-open eating space is occupied. Of course, my favorite aspect of Orchids is the consistency. Every time I've been there, I know what to expect and it's great for when I crave dim sum that won't hurt my wallet. Good location and ample parking as well.",

I'm guessing it was the chicken feet, since it's the only thing I ate that my family didn't (I'm fairly adventurous with my food and have had chicken feet many times at many different places, so this is more than just something \"not agreeing\" with my stomach).

The restaurant is large, so you typically do not have to wait that long to be seated and it's good for large groups. They have all your typical Dim Sum dishes that you love, but overall I've had better. This might be my go-to Dim Sum place in Vegas, but I know of places in Cali that are amazing in comparison.  If you don't know what Dim Sum is- it's like Asian tapas food. Little bite size chinese food that is wheeled out to you on little carts. You just point to the ones you want and they drop it off on your table and stamp your table card to keep track how many dishes to charge you for. Most of the time I don't know the name of any of the dishes, so I just point at the ones that look tasty and give them a try. That's that best way to experience Dim Sum for sure.",

    "text": "BF and I got shafted trying to go to Ethiopian today and went completely opposite for a hankering of dimsum delights.  Our dishes-  Har Gao- good, but small compared to other dimsum places. Shu Mai- decent and was juicy, Guk Char Siu Bao-  BBQ pork bun in sweet bun instead of white fluffy buns. These were were good, nice chewy, sweet buns and the pork was nicely seasoned Har Cheung Fun- fresh shrimp in large roll noodles with sweet soy. These were good, but the soy needed to be a tad more sweet and light....I think they might have not put the right sauce since that tasted more like seasoning soy. Yeung Qi Dze-  eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste served with a black bean sauce. It was okay, I don't know if I like it like that since there isn't much taste to the eggplant aside from the sauce outside. I like cooking eggplant in sauce better- it then takes the flavor...Better yet, get a eggplant hot pot- delish!  Pai gwat- pork spareribs. One of my favorite dimsum dishes...theirs was good, soft meat with a little fat and yummy black beans.  Fried Shrimp Balls- I dunno the Chinese name of this, but it''s fried crispy outside, shrimp inside and mayo for dipping...whats not to like?  Sin Chet Kuen- bean curd rolls with pork,mushroom and bamboo shoot inside and braised in a light sauce. These are one of my favorites as a kid....haven't had in a while and it brought me back. Dan Tat- egg custard pastry cups. Not bad, but not the best I've had. Needed more egg to pastry ratio I think, but the pastry was quite nice and flaky.  Mang gwo bu ding- pretty good mango pudding. It's a nice touch they put milk on top of it...this is how I eat it at home, but most places do not put milk on it.  Yes, there was only me and the BF. Today we were fatties and had a dim sum feast. I haven't done this in all the time I've lived in Vegas (3 years) so it was quite nice to do on a occasion...it was a monthly tradition growing up in LA.   The plus here is the service. Even though the carts are limited they keep them coming. Seriously, you are bombarded,in a friendly manner, with carts declaring their offerings every few minutes. If you are looking for something on the dimsum list that isn't on the carts, don't be afraid to ask as they are friendly here and will gladly get it for you if it's available. A server also comes around and checks on everyone often and was on our drink refills. This is absolutely refreshing after some rude treatment and being ignored at Changs (see my review).  Funny that this place runs all day and has just about as much dimsum selection as Changs as well. Limited, but in this situation it's acceptable for an all day dimsum to have just more of the popular dishes and not the \"imperial\" selections. Just a note, but lunch/regular dim sum time is cheaper until 3 pm, and the prices for dimsum go up after that. Still, it is still reasonable prices for late night dimsum 3-10pm. I have yet to come before 3 during lunch, but I imagine there will be more selection with a busier clientele at that time.   I have not tried Ping Pang Pongs...but I think this is the preferred spot for dim sum so far and might be the better of the places simply because we night folk can come have it anytime. Look, it's nothing like anything in LA, but it's good enough. If I keep comparing it then I set myself up for a bad day....it's like comparing a Honda Civic, good and reliable to a delicious, polished Audi S6. It's just on a different level.",

    "text": "Not a bad place to get your Dim Sum fix.  Its certainly cheaper than places on the strip for the tourist...aka..me.  Having tried Changs as well, this place is a little better and a little more expensive than Changs but way cheaper than the wallet draining strip dim sum places. (Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian...etc)    Arrived here on a weekday at around 11am and plentiful seats was to be found. By 1pm the restaurant was 3/4 full. I imagine being busier on the weekends.   At least there was a selection of teas (Heurn Peen, Teet Goon Yum, Bo Lei...sorry for the ching-lish translation...lol) aka not the typical green tea,  tea bag in a kettle tea.  Ordered: Har Gow - Shrimp dumplings - 3/5 Sui Mai - Pork Dumplings - 4/5 - Pretty good Ha Cheung - Shrimp Rice Roll in Soy Sauce - 4/5 Dan Tat - Egg tart - 2/5 - small and custard was too firm/chalky taste Chow Mein - 2/5 - Oily but tasty Pei Dan Sow Yook Jook - 1000 year old egg, pork congee - 3/5 Jeen Dui - Sesame Glutinous Ball - 2/5 - wheres the filling? Boa Loa Bow - Pineapple Bun - 4/5 - Yum! Fong Jou - Chicken Feet - 4/5 - Tasty  And a veggie steamed roll ...name escapes me in both Chinese and 'engrish'...lol4/5.  Atmosphere was typical Chinese dim sum with a few yells here and there from the servers.  Don't usually recommend sitting by the kitchen anywhere else, but its a prime spot for dim sum restaurants as you get the first picks/selections and everything is steaming hot.  Total with tip was $35 for 2 people.  The selection was certainly there and could of tried much more...aka spring rolls, veggie dishes, stuffed green peppers, tofu dessert...etc but 10 dishes for 2 people was 'pant sized-up' enough...lol.  Certainly far from the best Ive tasted but passable to get your fix in.",

After reading good reviews about this place the BF and I decided to give it a try and sadly we were disappointed!   First off they didn't open until 10:30, shouldn't dim sum be open at 8?! When they finally opened we got seated right away but service was VERY slow as there was only ONE CHART walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum. I don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right? .....WRONG!!! .....When the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all. The shu mai was okay I give them that but  the chicken feet was disgusting and everything else didn't taste fresh at all.   Totally would not eat here again!",

    "text": "Okay... I have only lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years now.  The only two places that I have had Dim Sum is at Cathay House (4x's) and Orchid Gardens (first time here).  Honestly, Cathay House has gotten a bit downhill.  So, after this experience, I kinda prefer this place now.  By the way, when I lived in London, we used to have Dim Sum with my clients every Sunday.  After a year of this, I don't frequent Dim Sum as much...lol..  Anyways, my aunt, uncle, and cousin invited me and the wife for a \"free\" lunch at Orchid Gardens.  Hey man, with a mortgage and expenses, the old saying, \"if it is free, it is for me\" truly applies.  Heck yeah, I accepted.  LOL...  We went on Sunday afternoon.  It was jammed pack.  We had to wait about 30 minutes.  When we got a table, it was difficult to maneuver through.    Service -- Well, let's start with the good.  The cart comes around quite frequently.  And, the ladies are very nice.  By the way, they hardly speak a word of english.  I think they are either Vietnamese, Chinese, or a mix of other Asian ethnicity.  But, they are all sweet and polite.  As for getting water or drinks.... Good luck.  Sometimes, I often wish that I bring a big bright flashing red light to alert waiters or bus people to our station for water or any other needs.  Overall, I give this a 3.5 (due to the nice ladies)  Food -- okay, for the life of me, my wife loves chicken feet.  Why oh why?  It is basically bones and skin; but, she devours them.  For someone who weighs 85 pounds, I can understand why.  Personally, I like the Shumai, the pork rib bones, anything with shrimp stuffed in it, and sticky rice.  There are others; but, I don't know how to write it in english.  Overall, the food is very fresh and it is quite good.  By the way, I wish they had more vegetable dishes... i.e. chinese broccoli or bok choy.  After our meal, our tab for about 6 people was barely under $100.  Not bad.   I would recommend this place.  Enjoy!",

I've been to a couple places that are popular here in town, but most we tried never left a good impression by the end of our meal. The last time I ever had good Dim Sum was in Hawaii, which is where I am from. So finding a place here in Vegas which had decent Dim Sum was a chore in itself.   My parents and I went out to have Dim Sum since it was their anniversary, and we decided to give Orchids a shot. We were surprised, the flavor was definitely not lacking and the prices where a bit higher than other places, but not too much-quite reasonable. The selection wasn't bad either, it wasn't on the more authentic side but it was enough for everyone to enjoy and feel satisfied.   We went there on a Thursday around 3p and it was a little busy but not so busy to where you are waiting for a table, we were seated right away. I am glad that my parents were quite pleased, and I was too. We will be back!",

It was like a snow day on a day you didn't do you homework.  I was seated in the busy restaurant and ready to nosh!  Dining here when it is busy reminded me of the crowded China Town streets of Chicago more than the food did.  Waitresses are running up and down the aisled with carts full of various small bites (Dim Sum).  While I liked the variety, I was not blown away by any one dish.  The pork buns, fried calamari, and shrimp puff all had very similar flavors, as if they were seasoned using the same ingredients.  They weren't bad, but did not taste that fresh.  I was reminded of buffet food, which is usually fine but not spectacular.    The regular menu here has some very interesting and authentic dishes.  (Sea Cucumber, various fungi, etc..)  The Dim Sum is really just like going to a Chinese buffet and not getting out of your seat when you want more.  To dine here without waiting very long, try coming at off times or during lunch on a weekday.    It is decent Chinese food at fair prices, but the Dim Sum leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "\"DO YOU WANT TO TRY THE CARL?\"  Uhhh is that the only thing you have here at Orchids Garden?  After an entire weekend of debauchery, eating the greatest foods, a saturday night partying in XS, I expected so much more from a highly yelped place.  Dim Sum all day: I don't understand this concept because i cannot fathom what happens right when we leave, more dimsum will either magically appear or you will close for a couple hours and reopen again for the hung-over and hung-ry.  Like my friend Jeff C. said last night, \"Shumai was like honey i shrunk the kids\" Because it was so little i questioned if i was really eating it or it was another Las Vegas desert mirage.  I've had bad dimsum before in San Diego, but man, it feels like, this is the absolute worst I have had. Its not that it was disgusting, but the whole idea of the little carts coming around and you choosing from a plethora of dim sum options was non existent and I was left sorely disapppointed.   The only think i had here was a potential to meet some people that i apparently danced the night away with... If i could remember them.  Unlike a night of partying with some major cuties, Orchids Garden left me with the smallest figment of resonating memories.  And why does everyone who works here look strange... and not speak a lick of engrish.  And no, I do not want to try the Carl. You have offered it 8 times.  Sooty L., Did we go to the same place because the place you are describing, Jeff C. and I wish we went there instead.",

The shrimp was small and it seemed like it was too much noodle.  I'm used to dim sum but my husband is still in his preemie stage with it.  While the food is not super awesome, it was great.  Service was the deciding factor.  You know how Chinese restaurants are.  You're lucky if they come to refill your drinks.  We didn't even have to ask.

We ordered: Chicken Char-siu Bao (manapua!) - I thought it was good, they are mini and the filling wasn't char-siu but it was some sort of chicken.  Shrimp Half moon - I really don't know what the chinese name of this is, but in Hawaii we call it half moon.  Pork Hash - They were small but I thought they were kind of oily.. but good! Shrimp Rolls: I call it look fun back home, but none of the ladies knew what the eff we were talking about. It is the shrimps wrapped with a sheet of rice paper with shoyu type sauce poured all over it. This is my favorite thing to order.  Eggplant w/Shrimp Paste: This was kind of cold by the time we got it, but it was ok. I ordered the bellpepper stuffed with this paste previously.. but I like the eggplant one better.  The service is quick. If it is not too busy, the ladies will come up to you every single time they come around.. even if you said you didn't want what was on their cart. We had to ask a few times for the shrimp rolls in the flat rice noodle, after about the 3rd time asking, the lady went to find that cart and brought the dish to us.   After about 6 plates, out bill was under $20. I've been wanting to try some other dim sum places.. but I like Orchids because its a big space and the dim sum is pretty good.",

All the items delivered to the table were hot and fresh, however we were kind of turned off by the aggressive waitresses.   The circle the room and despite your table being full of plates, they still try to push more food on you.   Can't say this is the best we have had , because we have had much better.  VERY PRICEY, we will not be going back.  Overall ok but not worth the price.",

I figured I should play it safe since I've never been there before and ordered a shrimp fried rice and some green beans. The rice was absolutely disgusting. No taste what so ever. No salt, no flavor at all. The green beans were ok. The waitress seemed surprised that we barely ate and we didn't want to take our left overs. The next day I went to a hair salon and they all agreed that this place has terrible food. Honestly next time I'll take my chances and opt for gas station food if I have to. This place was the worse. Do not eat here!!",

This place is located on the opposite end of Chinatown so it's a little quiet. I walked in around 4.00p and it was kinda dead. The dim sum carts were rolling just like if it was regular busy hours. You can either order straight from the menu or from the carts. The flavor was good but what bugged me was that some of be dim sum items were lukewarm. But, I guess it's hard to keep it fresh and warm it's offered all day and it's not busy. However, the fresh items were really good. The portions are also a little smaller which I like cuz usually after binging on dim sum I feel bloated. Plus, I feel less guilty. Overall, if you crave dim sum at non serving hours and need a quick fix come here.",

As it was my first time trying dim sum (and most of the food on the menu) I can't comment to how it stacks up to other dim sum restaurants in Las Vegas.   What I do know was that the food was delicious. I really didn't try anything that I didn't like (which is a great compliment from a super picky eater)! The food was all still hot when it was served to us, and the service from our waitress and the ladies piloting those yummy food carts around was great. A few times there were things that people in our party wanted that they didn't see on the cart, so they were brought out to us very quickly. If you don't see something you want on the carts, ask!   While I can't speak from extensive dim-sum-eating-experience, I do know that the food was good, and we had a great time at this restaurant (especially for the price). We will be back!",

    "text": "Wow... Reading some of the negative reviews prior to writing this is a little perplexing as I encountered no such things. My standards too low? Or yours too high? Princesses, do you get treated rudely often? Do you see the common denominator there? (Cough cough.. You.) Might I suggest you mind your own tone of voice and body language when speaking to someone. Respect goes two ways. Servers are there to serve you food, not be your personal servant. There is a difference. And if you're going to use a rude tone to someone don't be so shocked when you get it back. Try being polite and courteous. It will make a world of a difference in not just the response you get from servers, but from people in general. Not sure what to make of the \"treated like crooks\" comments. Might be from the same group.. Perhaps you ever thought to yourself that they are that vigilant because they got ripped off one too many times?? And I have taste buds. Thanks for wondering. I'm also full Chinese. So I know my dim sum. Need a blood sample? how about a geneologic family tree? (Insert eye roll here).  I've been to many dim sum places in LA, SF, HI, Vancouver, and Vegas. Everywhere I travel I will find me a dim sum place to try out. On my most recent trip to Vegas I ate here twice. Found this place via Yelp. Thank you Yelp! There aren't many dim sum places in Vegas. The others I have been to are mediocre at best. Given the lack of competition Orchid Garden is the best in Vegas that I have tried.   With that said.. Neither times that I came was I presented with rude behavior. They were actually quite pleasant and helpful. The first time it was around lunch (12:00 pm) and the second late breakfast (10:00 am). Both times our food was hot, fresh, and good tasting. Lots of options for dim sum. For that matter I have never been to a place with so many selections to choose from. Hence why I had to come twice so I could try as many as my little piggy heart desired. Well seasoned. Not overcooked. I really liked the shrimp ball on sugar cane skewer. The only dish I wasn't crazy about was the daikon/radish cake. The daikon was a bit bitter, which told me it was slightly undercooked. Otherwise just about everything we tried was yummy.   From what I could see and tell this place was clean. No pieces of food stuck onto utensils. No dirty cups.  No fingers went into my water. I inspect my plate, cups, and silverware before eating everywhere I go. Bit of a germaphobe. The place is huge and just looked a little old. I would go back my next trip out to Sin City.",

Orchids Garden is in the garden-variety 3 star quality level. Nevertheless, it's dim sum at night, I can't complain!  This is normally the part where I would tell you the har gow is superior to their disappointing sui mai, and that there was a lack of consistency on warmth levels on a few dishes, but like I said, I'm not gonna complain. Egg rolls were conspicuous by their absence, but the fried crab and fried wontons made up for it. The baked sweet cream bun was a pleasant surprise. A variety of BBQ pork options were available. Prices were also quite reasonable.  I assumed going in that the dinner menu would be limited and service would be minimal. But let your heart not be troubled, the carts come out at night, pass by often, drink refills are frequent, and you can order non dim sum dishes off the dinner menu.  *it's not actually ALL DAY, just all hours they're open, so not like at 4 in the morning",

Rude when there was no reason to be rude. A group of 7 people were going to pay the bill separately and so we went to the counter to pay. Right off the bat was rude to me and my friends demanding tip when we haven't even said an amount yet and accusing us of not paying the entire bill when we were still a few waiting to pay.

While the quality is definitely not on par with the 626 in California, it was decent and the service was quick. Not sure if speaking Canto helped, but god damn they came by immediately and if one of the ladies didn't have what we wanted, the manager or hostess near by would place that order on the quickness.

Did not want to kill it until the manager saw that it was alive. Trapped it under plenty of napkins for the lady to see/kill it for herself. Had no appetite afterwards.. Had to wait for the food we had already ordered and refused to order anymore after we placed our first order. No manager came to speak or apologize to us.

Different choices for dim sum with carts being rolled around in the restaurant, with items for you to choose from. Everything from shumai to dessert.  I gave it three stars because it took a while for the shumai to come around. The service is average but not that great. I would come back here for the food, yet you have to come hungry. Still, the dim sum was good, but I have had better.",

Lots of other dim sum restaurants usually only have carts at lunch then switch to a menu of entrees plus some select dim sum items at dinner. I appreciate that Orchids ALWAYS has carts going, especially when you have a dim sum dinner craving. I probably first came here around eight years ago, but I eat here every other month or so and they're very consistent. Dim sum here is good, affordable, and convenient. You could manage a quick lunch here if you work nearby. Service is typically great when I come here and the hostess is always nice.   Lots of parking available right outside the restaurant. Also kind of random, but as a huge Final Fantasy fan I have to mention that they sometimes play orchestral versions of classic FF soundtracks from the games. I love it, but couldn't help laughing when I recognized the music for the first time.",

The restrooms as well as the dining area is very clean and that's something that I always looks for when entering a place that I know deals with a lot of people...and lots of oil/grease. (It's Dim Sum!)   Speed: there is a wait, especially when going for lunch like we did, but within 20 min we were seated and the food came right to us. Barely gave us time to order drinks, which was fine because we were starving! There were always carts coming and and out, and although those who pushed the carts were hard to understand or wanted us to hurry, they were efficient and getting around the restaurant.   Food: love the variety of foods both fried, steamed, etc. Good variety of salty (shumai, dumplings, sticky rice, shrimp balls, etc.) and sweet (sesame red bean balls, custard tarts, etc). Tasty and delicious!   **Also, if you don't like what's coming around, they have a menu that you can order from!",

We always get the steamed and baked pork buns, rice cake, shrimp rice noodle rolls, tofu pudding, spare ribs, tripe, taro cake, egg custards, shu mai, crystal shrimp dumplings, pineapple custard buns, mango pudding, my aunt likes the meatballs and the fried taro balls.  My sister always orders take out so she doesn't have to make breakfast for the kiddies the next morning.    The pricing is based on the plates and compared to other dim sum places it's not the cheapest but the quality of food is there (big whole pieces of shrimp).  We get so full off the dim sum that we haven't really tried any of their \"regular\" dishes but we always see ppl ordering the pan fried noodles which always look so yummy.",

You don't needa do dishes, clear off and wipe down tables, no after feast vacuuming. Just bring your huge families here for that party :-D  Weekends are crazy busy. But even then, their carts pass by frequently enough. Tuesday night seems like a good time to grub; not packed or loud. Can't say too much about service since it's pretty easy - yes or no? How many? Okay.   But when I lived in the bay area, the only time I'd get to have dim sum was when I'd visit my sis in San Francisco. We'd walk to Chinatown from North Beach cuz she used to live near Pier 39.  NOW here in Vegas, dim sum is available everyday until 10:30pm! Huuuuh...  Don't get hooked... self control. Mind over matter. Control your impulse. Warning: may cause food coma.

EVERYTHING was SO onolicious!!!  No disappointment here.  This place does not skimp on filling.  I especially liked the shrimp eggplant (very tasty), sugarcane shrimp (VERY good) and fried chive dumpling (packed with chives) - but again, everything was good.  The sauce for the tripe was so tasty that I started dipping all my dim sum in it and it just took the flavor profile up a notch or two.  Friendly service, despite not really understanding what was being said - and they not understanding us.  But the hostesses were fast and attentive.  Lots of parking and the air con was a nice retreat from the 110 temps outside.  Try it.  I'm sure you will not be disappointed...",

The food per se was pretty tasty. I wish there were more sauces to dip the dim sum in but I was only given soy sauce. I also wish the plates we finishes were cleared from the table faster since we had stacks of plates in the middle.   There are servers that are walking around the room with different dishes.

It wasn't super crowded at first but it did start after being there 20 mins. I can imagine there being a small wait certain times and days. How it works is food is brought by on carts. You can get a plate and they stamp your receipt. Don't be afraid to say no if you are waiting for other carts or you could end up full and not able to try stuff. All the food I had was good. My advice is to not be afraid and try different things. I felt like I had a good variety. My girlfriend and friend did get some of the same stuff and got full so they didn't get to try some other stuff as it came out on the cart. The price for 3 people seemed reasonable since we all were full. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Okay ladies and gents... I am FINALLY writing a review about this place after how many times I've been here! LOL Don't believe my number of check-ins on Yelp, because I've been here a countless number of times over the years.  Dim Sum has always been one of my favorite Asian cuisines since I was little. :] I would always get excited with the steam carts that come rolling around because the food is not only ready when you say, but it's downright delicious. Can't stress that enough.  This restaurant has been around for several years now and I'm glad it still exists. Their dim sum is authentic and one of the best tasting. They may not have what you want from the steam cart all the time, but you can always order it fresh. Which is a good thing, so you know that it hasn't been sitting in the cart all day.  My absolute fave items are the shrimp noodle, shumai, hargow, beef tripe, shrimp dumplings, and shark fin dumplings. For dessert, make sure to order the sweet cream buns! So bomb. Their regular menu is good too.  I frequent this place so much, that the workers have become my friends. HAHA They know my big appetite for dim sum is real. Being a fellow Asian, I criticize every lil thing about this cuisine because I want it to taste the same every time. Now the only downfall is that some menu items are really oily, but steamed food is better than fried. Plus, dim sum portions are small so it's not the worse thing, but something to consider for those that watch for their oil and salt intakes.  The restaurant itself is not formal, but they occupy a big space. It's a whole building. lol Which is really great if you come here with a big group.  Give this place a try when your craving for dim sum is too much to handle. Let it become your go-to place when you want to order for pick-up too. It's a stand alone restaurant for a reason.",

Nothing really new and exciting, and it does feel as tho they are getting sloppy on the prep.

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 63/100  You know it's authentic when all the waitresses are yelling at each other, look pissed off and pass your table without stopping to see if you want anything on their cart. This is how we Asians communicate, don't take it personal. :-P It's quite comedic actually.   More of a 3.5 stars. I have been here a few times before, but that was a while ago. After having dim sum in San Francisco and LA, the dim sum here were okay.   - I suggest going during lunch, as the prices are much cheaper for the same selections.   - Not everything on the menu are on the carts, just ask and they'll make it for you.   - Some of the dim sum options are good and others could be done better.   - Dim Sum selections: Shark Fin was delicious and worth getting. The Shrimp Har Gow not as good, the outer layer was too thick. Shumai was good. We got a few other items, I don't remember the names, those were mediocre. See photos.   - Pass on the pork buns, sesame balls -- better quality at Diamond Bakery in Chinatown.   - The fried rice and calamari were better than I've had at other dim sum and Chinese restaurants. Fried rice was oily and made fresh. Calamari pieces were huge and had a nice flavor to it. Those were my favorites among the non-dim sum items.   - A little a cheaper on some items than the last dim sum restaurant I went to (in LA.) Our bill came out to $40, more than enough to feed 3 people and have left overs.   We came in at the right time. esp during Dec. TV was airing Star Wars A New Hope.   TIP: keep track of what they stamp on your ticket. Sometimes, they accidentally charge you for more than you ordered. This happens at most dim sum places.   - We went yesterday, Saturday (Dec 17) around dinner time 5pm. It wasn't busy.   Free tea was delicious. It was either chrysanthemum or jasmine tea. We asked and she said it a few times: \"chrysanth-jasmine.\" If you ask again, you'll most likely get the same answer. haha.  BONUS: Get a free cute Chinese calendar during December, while supplies last.",

It has this tender bbq pork inside of a baked bun that has been brushed with some kind of glaze that makes it sticky! It taste like a Krispy Kreme donut pork sandwich! Sweet and savory. May sound weird but it's a must try! Next, their custard buns! Soft and moist buns filled with a custard cream inside and a little crisp on tops of the bun. Best desert ever! I can eat an entire order by myself! And then there are their fried noodles that have so much flavor but yet is so simple. Then the chive dumplings are also amazing with a little bit of soy sauce. These are literally my favorite things and  their prices are great! Try this place and try everything I recommended! You'll love it!",

While Orchids Garden is not one of the best dim sum restaurants I have eaten at, it is probably the best in Las Vegas.  On a typical weekend morning, I notice that 90% of the diners are Asian (which is a good sign) and the food carts arrive with just prepared dishes from the kitchen.  The selection is not has large as say, LA or SFran, but it has most of the required dishes.   The restaurant is large but the parking lot tends to get filled by 11am on weekends and you may have to park on the street.   This is the dim sum restaurant we bring our out of town visitors to.",

When you eat enough Dim Sum, you can generally tell if it is fresh due to its appearance. Most items here are fresh but once in a while I will want something that has obviously been sitting on the cart too long.  In that case, ignore it and get something else or ask them to make it fresh.  Usually busy restaurant that becomes an incredibly busy restaurant during holidays and Chinese New Years.  Eat Dim Sum.

The ladies are really helpful and will make sure you get what you want.  Some of my favorites are the shumai, dumplings, shrimp balls, and green peppers with shrimp on top.  Make sure you ask for the black bean sauce it is great on the green peppers.  If you have never been to dim come before make sure you get those shrimp balls!!

So subpar. Dimsum of this quality would never fly in the Bay Area.  Today was surprisingly busy, but the wait wasn't long. 20 minutes for a table of 5 to be seated.  We ordered the basic dimsum - xiu mai, hargao, and shrimp noodle rolls. The xiu mai was a bit smaller than I was used to back in the Bay, but that didn't bother me much. Flavor was there; not impressive, but also didn't disappoint. But it didn't taste fresh...it looked frozen.  Hargao was also a little bit smaller than what I was used to. Flavor was actually subpar, as I tasted nothing. Also looked frozen, not fresh.  Shrimp noodle rolls were a huge disappointment. No flavor in the rolls, despite it being soaked in the soy sauce. Why is that? It's because the SHRIMP was so damn small! This is a sure sign that food in the kitchen is frozen, not fresh.  We also ordered other dimsum dishes, such as shrimp with eggplant, chicken feet, fried crab balls, fried meat balls, and steamed buns. In addition, hot and sour soup and honey walnut shrimp was ordered.  The shrimp with eggplant was actually decent. There was some flavor in the shrimp, but the eggplant elevated the dish just a little more.  Chicken feet was also decent. The sauce it was tossed / coated in was flavorful, but chicken was average; a bit dry and looked overcooked.  Fried crab balls had a lot of flavor in them, and the crab claw embedded in the ball elevated the presentation.  Fried meat balls were average - 95% batter and 5% actual meat filling. I wouldn't suggest getting this st any dimsum place ANYWHERE, as it is just too greasy and lacks a bunch of flavor.  The steamed bun I ordered was actually a Chinese sausage bun. Some flavor was present, but the sausage itself was so dry that it shouldn't be considered a sausage anymore. It's jerky.  The hot and sour soup was your standard hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant. Packed spice for sure, but flavor itself was average.  The honey walnut shrimp came to me as a pleasant surprise to me. Each puny shrimp was battered, deep-fried, then tossed in a bath of mayo. This is VERY different from honey walnut shrimp I'm used to in the Bay (large shrimp tossed in a lighter bath of mayo, and thank god it's not battered and deep-fried). Flavor was very much absent due to the batter, but mayo made up for some of what was missing. Walnuts were average, with a standard crunch.  Chinese broccoli with XO sauce was subpar. Completely soaked in sesame oil, which meant I missed out on the freshness of the vegetables. I didn't have any sauce, so I can't speak much on that.   Service, for a lack of a better word, was slow and from what I observed, actually crappy. Rude hostess at the front killed the vibe I had for this restaurant. $110 for 5 people, from what we ordered, so it's not AS economically-friendly, but it's a better value than the places on the Strip.",

    "text": "If you love Dim Sum, if your into eating great Chinese food, as authentic as Beijing and Shanghai, Orchid Garden is the spot. Plenty of parking. Plenty of seating and I will be seated quickly. I recommend coming here ANYDAY except Sunday brunch as a lot of people will be there to because it's post church.. Either way ANYDAY and anytime is good. You will enjoy your experience here. Pork and shrimp Shu Mai, the eggplant, oh and chow me in are my first go too as soon as I sit down then the shrimp ball and short ribs quench my hunger. My mom first brought me here 4-5 years ago no I haven't found a better place to have dim sum except in Calgary Canada but that's a whole nother review.  My absolute favorite is the egg tart. Yes the desert.  Sometimes I order a dozen before I get the check.  I'm lying, I order a dozen egg tarts every time I visit.   You'll be happy with the service as well. It's not like they are there waiting on your hands and knees, but either making eye contact or raising your hand for anything and consider it taken cared of.   Before I forget when you sit down and order your drink, the green tea is always detoxifying and tasty, have some bucchoy and you'll start to enjoy the fine cuisine  How the Chinese do it!  Take the drive to Sahara and you won't regret visiting this fine establishment. The Chinese are awesome for this type of restaurant opening here in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My family and I come here often because we miss the dim sum in Hawaii.  After wandering (for 2 years in Las Vegas), we finally decided to make our way into Orchids this year.  I am so glad that we did!  The dim sum is reasonably priced and the selection is abundant.  I would best compare it to Happy Day Chinese Restaurant on Waialae Ave in Honolulu.  FYI, Saturday lunches are always so busy!  Expect to wait a few minutes to be seated.  If you are looking for more \"authentic\" dim sum, then this isn't it, although they do have their fair share of dim sum from chicken feet in black bean sauce to steamed char siu bao.  My kids enjoy the shumai and the rice wrapped in lotus leaf the most.  But what they really go there for is the sweets!  Lotus bean jin dui (sesame balls filled with lotus or red bean) is ever so present there, just like in Hawaii (yay!).  And often, but not always, they have the cart going around serving you this sweet tofu dessert.  It's a freshly made silken tofu served hot in a sweet ginger-infused syrup.  I'm not sure what they call it in Chinese, but the cart ladies go around asking \"sweet tofu?  sweet tofu?\"  I know it's made there fresh, because the owner (I think she is one), always reminds us (she knows us that much) that a fresh one is being made ready in 5 minutes or so.  The one thing we would love to see happen is Orchids being open for morning breakfast/brunch.  In Hawaii, it is common to have dim sum for breakfast.  But here in Las Vegas, not so common.  Too bad.  The staff is friendly, as friendly as any Chinese restaurant staff could be...if you haven't been to a Chinese restaurant, don't expect too much in polite, unhurried style of service.  They don't speak English very well, but I would still recommend to stick it out and try it, or just go with someone who knows how and what to order.  If you're from Hawaii, you will probably run into a few local residents who used to live in Hawaii.  That's what I like about Orchids...feels like as if we were home again...",

I would recommend going before 3 (I believe) because they raise the prices per dish after that.  I would also recommend the pork shumai, shrimp wonton with mayonaise dressing, salty spicy squid, the barbecue pork bun, and the sweet rice cake for dessert!  and off the menu order the yang chow fried rice.   2 people can eat well for about $30 bucks. If you go on the weekend it gets busy around 11 and usually dies around 1ish. Sometimes its not that bad if it is busy because then the carts are always moving and passing you. Sometimes when it is slower you might have to wait longer for what you want to come around.",

I loved the steamed cha siu bow (BBQ pork steamed bun) with its delicious sweet sauce.  I indulged in a sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves with ground pork and one delectable bite of Chinese sausage.  It's one of my \"comfort foods.\" Remarkably good service for a Chinese restaurant, too.

This is when 90% of the time the food is hot. The crowd has yet to form. If you miss this time try your best to sit in the room in the east (left room from entrance). This is where the carts come out and you're most likely to get the hottest items. When you can't get the carts to come in time, grab your waiter and tell them what you want.

Was I in a sushi restaurant, not a dim sum restaurant? Nope. Just horrible.  @ Shrimp Dumplings - One of the orders, the skin fell apart. The other the shrimp was all mushy, as if it has been nuked in the microwave.   @ Pork Dumplings - Cold and mushy. Same texture as the shrimp dumplings.   @ Sesame Balls - Oily, cold, goopy item. Once this gets cold, it just gross.  @ Jook - They ran out by 1PM. Blah.  There were more items, but I guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes.   Some of you may be saying, show up earlier or go during prime time dim sum time. Yup, I'm fully aware of that. But what kind of establishment goes from good to suckage for the changeover to regular lunch? If a restaurant lets me order it, I can review it as is. This just shows poor quality control on their part, willing to sacrifice their name to earn a couple of bucks for disappointing dim sum. Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.  I'll be willing to give this place another chance and I'll come during prime time, but I can't see the score improving that much. Until then, stay out of this place after 1pm.",

    "text": "I love that they have dim sum all day. Only been here once and it was just okay to below average. I ordered my usual favorites: calamari was cold and greasy, though very crispy, probably would have been quite good if it were hot and fresh.  Fried taro wasn't very good, outside was not light and fluffy at all, and I didn't like the filling.  Sticky rice wrapped in leaves was okay, but I've had better, did not detect any mushrooms in the filling which is my favorite part. Shu mai was good. Shrimp dumplings okay. Leek dumplings were greasy. The chicken bao was good but could have used more filling. The shrimp rice noodle roll also lacked filling. The congee just didn't look like there was much it it so I didn't get any. The 8 dishes ordered and hot tea came out to $30 and some change. Just a side note...I felt pretty queasy after eating there. Chang's is better!",

On top of everything else if it were really a great financial deal I would still tell people to go here and get a cheap meal, but it cost as much as our favorite dim sum spot does who has exceptional food.

The only way to achieve that was to leave the strip so we uber'd it to Chinatown.    Based on the yelp reviews I had read, this place appeared to have the best dim sum in all of Las Vegas so we came here.  We arrived a little after 10:30 and by the time we left (before noon), the place was pretty packed.  They did a good job at pushing carts around to every table and stocking up whenever they ran out.  Sounds simple, but apparently these are difficult tasks for the dim sum restaurants in Houston.  They had a good variety of different dishes, and the workers were friendly and prompt whenever we had questions.    Overall, I thought it was pretty good, and I would definitely return if I wanted some dim sum off the strip.",

    "text": "For good dim sum in Las Vegas, you probably won't find a much better place than Orchids Garden.  Because of their all day dim sum dining, the place is steadily busy!  We finally decided to try Orchids Garden because we kept hearing about it.  There are a ton of places on Spring Mountain that cater to the dim sum crowd but Orchids Garden off of Sahara kept coming up.  Off to dim sum we go!  The lady and I went on a Saturday for lunch time and it was no joke, the restaurant was full!  There were people shouting and whistling as carts full of wonderful dim sum were whizzing around the dining area.  There was steam and foul-sounding  Chinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice to see the hustle and bustle.  Gotta get your dim sum order in before the cart runs out and you have to wait!  After being seated we were given a regular restaurant menu and the dim sum menu.  It was a nice touch, prices were given in categories, and pictures were used for the various dim sum to make it easier for patrons who are not familiar with the art of dumplings.  I've watched dim sum making before, and damn, it truly is an art because you gotta be patient and be able to put out quality dim sum in almost no time flat.  Oh my aching hands!  Orchids Garden dim sum is fairly priced.  Still a bit more than dim sum from places like Cali, but not bad for Vegas standards.  All dim sum dishes range from around $2 - $6 area, and there is something for just about everyone.  Me?  I love sticking to the cheap, cheap, cheap end of the dim sum spectrum.  I think all dim sum should be cheap!  It's supposed to be akin to street food!  Who the heck wants to pay $6 for friggin' Chinese broccoli?  I don't.  Some of our faves:  -Steamed chicken feet (love it) -Steamed BBQ pork bun -Pan fried daikon cake -Baked BBQ pork bun (yummy) -Shrimp har gow -Pan fried chives dumpling (chive-y) -Beef in rice noodle -Mushroom shiu mai  The chicken feet here are fantastic!  Sticky, fatty, and delicious with a bowl of hot white rice.  We employ multiple orders of this whenever we go.  I am also a big fan of the chives dumpling since I am an onion lover.  Each of the dim sum above is in the $2 - $4 range for each serving.  Not too cheap but not so expensive it breaks the bank.  I've had better dim sum in other places but I think for Las Vegas it is pretty good.  Not to mention, dim sum all day?  It appeals to a lot of (drunk @$$)people here.    I've seen the restaurant menu but have yet to try anything off of it.  But it does have a massive amount of choices which is good.  But for now, dim sum me up...baby!  Verdict?  Orchids Garden is a good spot for some decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim sum comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK, although some folks say the service can be a bit rude.  But then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  So the next time you have a dim sum craving and can't decide where to go, give Orchids Garden a try.  Just remember, it's off of Sahara and not Spring Mountain!",

We have a lot of places to compare to, so we weren't expecting extraordinary food. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem on the way to a gun range. Stopped in for lunch, it was excellent! The dim sum was very fresh and tasty, with a wide variety to choose from. My favorite was the ginger tripe and the hubs loved the tendon dish. We also ordered the house special fried rice....it was good, but not anything special. I have to admit, the service was beyond excellent - the staff was attentive, fast and nice, nothing like what we're used to at other chinese restaurants. The prices here are a little high given what we ordered, but we'll definitely be back again. You can't beat all day dim sum :)",

    "text": "This is one of our two dim sum restaurant of choice in Las Vegas.  The price is inexpensive for dim sum, and conveniently located for students attending classes at CSN's Cheyenne and Charleston campuses.  We usually only go to dim sum between 11am-1pm, so have not encountered issues with dim sum being cold. The food we typically order are usually served hot or warm, unless it is supposed to be served cold.  The variety of selection is comparable to most other dim sum restaurants.  The quality is average, nothing that blows away your expectations, and is a good value for the menu pricing.  Is it the best quality dim sum available in Las Vegas?  No. Is it good dim sum for the price?  Absolutely!",

I had a couple dim sum dishes but the best thing was the duck...OMG!  It was the first time in my life I ever had duck that I liked...no change that to loved!   Go here for authentic Chinese, peeps..you won't be sorry!",

Some of the servers are very English-challenged, but there are many others willing to assist.  The chicken feet are some of the best I've had.  Always fresh, hot, and tasty.  The shau mai are also very good, but they seem smaller than other places.",

The quality of food is among the most consistent I have ever experienced and they set the bar high. The owners take notice of their regulars and acknowledge them by remembering favorite dishes. The environment is comfortable, and if you listen carefully you will hear arranged Final Fantasy music playing on the speakers. I recommend this place for anyone who enjoys dim sum or if you want to try out something new!",

I guess the early bird gets the best dim sum choices.   Service is mediocre like most chinese restaurants.  You could get death by dim sum cart if your not careful during busy times.  Atmosphere is noisy like any dim sum joint.  Overall I give them 4 stars for the variety and goodness of the dim sum.",
