The bottom line is that the burgers here a very good but I had to deduct one star because they don't offer mayonnaise. I just don't get that! Maybe they think mayo is unhealthy but what are burgers and fries? haha  If you don't care about mayo, this is your place. A fairly simple menu (like the original McDonald's). They keep the place clean, too.  The one on Sahara is less busy but the same good food.",

    "text": "I visited my first In-N-Out when I was sixteen.  In the many years since that first glorious bite I have never, NEVER had a negative experience.  Be it sitting in the lobby after 10 people placed there order or being at one of the more popular locations and having 20 cars ahead of me I always received exceptional service and a great burger.  This particular establishment seems to have been built for the onslaught of Double Double eaters.  The drive thru is long and actually some what aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  LIke every other In-N-Out I have been to, you can see the employees inside hustling to manufacture on the greatest burgers ever!  My negative review is a result of making a rather non-complex order and having only two vehicles ahead of me.  It was on a Saturday around 12:00 in the PM. I just want to note that the inside of place was not slammed by any stretch.  I sat there for over 10 minutes watching all the employees not move with any sense of urgency.  I thought maybe these two people ahead of me had made outlandish orders but this was not the case as I saw only one bag make it's way out the drive-thru window.  When I pulled up to the window, I did not receive any of the normal In-N-Out pleasantries.  The employee looked at me briefly and then went about making the brink holders.  I sat there like an idiot with my money in my hand for about 30 seconds and then I bailed.",

If you are feeling adventerous I suggest trying the fries prepared animal style and the 4x4 burger.  The staff is awesome!  If all fast food was prepared and served by people like those at In-N-Out maybe then I would agree with an increase in the minimum wage.  Still not a $15 per hour job but these people do deserve maybe $10 an hour???  Ok ok, sorry no more politics!  I think I will be eating here today for lunch the food is that good!",

The price meets the quality and you can tell the employees really enjoy their job and are paid well because it shows while they're working and it makes a world of difference to the customers.

It's really a great business strategy.  Food 4/5: Can't give a 5-stars to a fast food... But this is THE burger I would eat in a world of only fast food joint. Nothing is frozen at In-N-Out. This is one of the reasons that they haven't expended too much because of the location of their distribution centers. Service 4/5: Always great and friendly service. Consistent to their customers and I like it.  Make sure to try their Secret Menu... Animal Style Fries or if let me know if U dare having a 4x4 Protein Wrap Animal Style (No bun). One last thing that I love about this location is that it's less crowded than the other locations located on the Strip or close by. Also, don't be a lazy dog and go inside get your order instead of doing the drive-in, you'll get it MUCH FASTER than the cars waiting in the line.",

Girl, what do you even mean by that?  If you could kindly cut me some slack, I'm going to admit here on the Internet that (up until a few months ago), I have always been a wee bit of a burger snob. At most every burger joint, I would order a hamburger with nothing but the meat and bun. No lettuce or tomato, no onion or pickles and definitely no condiments whatsoever... I know. You despise me. You think I'm a weirdo.  On rare occasions, I'd try something new, but a lot of the time--just the meat and bun, like plain vanilla. And here at In-N-Out, I'd either have that or a grilled cheese, fries, and a shake.  After finally deciding to put an end to my picky habits, I marched over to this location and had my very first, real In-N-Out hamburger (not the Double-Double... Baby steps! Baby steps!)... And, god, it was freaking awesome. I now find myself craving In-N-Out a lot...  Yeah, this could be dangerous.",

I wish they would branch out to the Midwest, they're seriously that good, only problem with that is I would eat there too much and get crazy fat.  The cool thing with in-n-out (aside from the free paper hats) is that you can get their burgers wrapped in lettuce w/o sauce (protein style) and it's just as tasty as if you got the real thing; bun, sauce and all. The even better thing is that it doesn't taste like fast food.  You can tell that the meat, fries and everything in between are fresh. Plus the late hours are wonderful for those of us that don't have normal schedules or have been out too late partying on the strip. Staff here is also very friendly and helpful.",

I would have given 4 stars if the fries had even been halfway decent - but they were so bad that it kind of ruined the whole experience - I will not go back again unless i hear this has changed - although i hear they are going to open a location on the strip in the miracle mile shops - but that is just a rumor...",

The organized chaos of the place added to the In-N-Out experience...honestly, I think I'd be disappointed if I could just walk up and get my burger without the wait...",

Everything tastes like it should, but you may find that the cheese on the animal style fries is a bit congealed, or the burger patties may be a bit more charred than usual. And though the service is brisk, you will definitely find yourself crowd surfing to pick up your order. However, this location has a small souvenir shop in the parking lot filled with reasonably priced shirts, hats, and tchotchkes that adds a dose of silly fun to your visit. With its yellow arrow adorned with flashing lights, this In-N-Out is definitely characterized by Vegas.",

I reside in LA County home of the in n out burger,  and frankly as much as I love in n out, this location by far is not up to par with the many other locations I've been to. My girlfriend lives no more than 1 mile away, and today's experience has made me decide to review this place.   First off,  the design of how the drive thru is makes it difficult for dine in customers to park on the side where it begins.  As the line gets long,  you would be stuck in your parking space with dumb drivers still blocking you as you're halfway out of your space.  Yes this just happened to me.   Now for my food. Presentation is pretty much standard for all locations. I got my normal,  post workout meal of a cheeseburger,  mustard fry,  whole grilled onions and a double meat,  whole grilled onions and lettuce wrapped and man do I regret getting it lettuce wrapped.  The lettuce doesn't even wrap around the meats,  and for being whole grilled onions,  I got a measly two rings of onions???  Really?!  Ugh. My cheeseburger was alright I guess since pretty much tastes the same as all the other places I've been to.    The workers were friendly so that's a plus,  and was quick to open an additional register once the dine in line became long. The workers and cleanliness off the location is the only thing that stopped me from giving this place 2 stars.   I don't ask for much from in n out,  just the same quality and comfort that you get at every location.",

She greeted me outside and took my order because of the long line, I was met with a smile and then when I got to the window Boom she was there too!

I can't stand the grease and I definitely feel the after sickness hours or days after eating an over greased burger paired with super salty fries. In-N-Out however is the complete opposite. Perfect for when you're craving a juicy burger, minus the frozen fast food taste. You can literally taste the freshness, especially in the fries. And they make it the way you want it (animal style, grilled onions!)   This location is particular is fair, obviously, like any fast food joint you're going to run into a long line especially around noon/1pm..this is the closest location to my work, so I'll stop by during my lunch every once and a while and you can tell the line is purely from a high volume of customers - the employees are really working their butts off. Best location in town I've experienced as of yet!",

While the food is great, the place is always packed (because, let's face it, everyone loves In 'N Out). If you plan on dining in, you have to play a game of stalking tables. You know, place your order and then prowl around the dining area waiting for some unsuspecting customers to finish eating and then snatch up their table (preferably after they get up- you don't want to be too over zealous). Crowded dining area aside, this place is great and I look forward to going back.",

As a tip to those thinking of doing the same, while there is not a line of cabs lined up outside like a hotel, there does seem to be a relatively decent flow of cabs that come and go from the parking lot.  On to the food:  This is my second visit to In-N-Out.  I got a 4-by-4 with fries and a Coke on my quest to continually evaluate what is the best fast food chain burger in America.  This latest trip confirmed for me that In-N-Out is at least a half-step ahead of Five Guys.  It also confirmed for me, though, that In-N-Out is a couple of steps behind my personal favorite: Cook-Out (of North Carolina).",

The burger was good, but I did not find it to be the gloriousness of all burgers as so many other reviewers do.  Perhaps my expectations were set too high by so many wonderful reviews.  I did like the special sauce on the burger, but it didn't taste much different to me than any other burger at any other place.  The fries are okay, same story, good but not fantastic.  For less than $6, it was a decent lunch.  The line was crazy long - be prepared for a wait - I'm told it's always like that.  There is a merchandise store right next door, and they had some great sales - scored 3 T-shirts for the kids for $12 total.  I was pretty happy about that.",

The truth of the matter is, it depends how you like it.  In this case, it depends what you like on your burger.  Since I'm not a fan of slices of cheap raw tomato with snotty tomato goo in the middle, crappy iceburg lettuce, and mystery hot orange sauce, in - n -out is not my burger style.  I'm more of a bacon, sliced avocado, sauteed mushrooms kind of a gal.  The meat and cheese at in-n-out is good.  The patties are flavorful and juicy and the cheesy is melty and generous.  But if you don't like their ALL-American (aka boring) toppings, that's all you get.  The fries suck - plan and simple.  I ordered fries at an in-n-out once; never again.  Now, I just stick to a burger.   Also, plan on waiting a MINIMUM of 20 minutes just for 1 burger - even at the drive through.",

We like eating food with adequate amount of fat but this Double Double was way too greasy, we think the grease amount was beyond appropriate, which gave a negative effect on the burger overall. I think the grease was from the making of the food.   We definitely don't crave for In-N-Out burgers, we might come again only due to 1) convenience or 2) running out of options or 3) very very low budget.",

The menu is short and to the point. Burgers, fries and shakes. What more could you want?   Once my ordered arrived I was anxious to dig in, but not without a Instagram-worthy photo-op to tell the world I dined at In-N-Out for the first time. My double double burger was fresh, juicy, and every bite of deliciousness. The fries are freshly made every day and topped with their secret sauce, I now know why it's such a hit.

They fry them a bit longer which adds a nice crunch. Sometimes I'll have them throw cheese on the fries or get them animal style if I'm feeling frisky. Don't forget about the chili peppers they offer you on the side if you want some added spice to your meal. Be careful though, the chili peppers are very spicy.",

To me, this place is the best burger place with speedy service and consistency. I love places with few things on the menu and they make it to perfection. I'm a simple kind of person so I don't need nothing fancy but excellent food and service. Every person who works here work to their fullest. I haven't met anyone who are lazy or mess up my orders like the other fast food chains.   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to eat another meal here on Christmas day because they were closed. Although I was disappointed, I'm happy for the workers who are able to spend Christmas with their families.   Lastly, I like to clarify a rumor, In-N-Out will never come to Hawaii. The gift shop person tells me that's like building a bridge between Hawaii to California. Their quality control is that strict.",

Given the fact that we were starving after a 5 hour flight plus hotel check in experience, I would have thought we would have enjoyed it more.  Instead, I found myself comparing it to the east coast Five Guys burgers, which are an up and coming burger chain.  The burger was OK, but not great.  It seemed a little dry and bland.  I did enjoy the fries more than the burger.  Maybe this is a coastal difference?  None of the 4 people who went thought it was anything other than a fast food burger/fries, which surprises me given the plethora of postive ratings.",

    "text": "This is my favorite fast-food burger joint.   The menu is small and simple, with just a few items,.  This simplicity is definitely a virtue because it helps In-N-Out to maintain its commitment to high quality ingredients.  Their beef, for example, contains no additives, fillers, or preservatives.  This is important to me because I will rarely eat meat anymore unless I know it's free of sodium nitrate.    The burger comes with beef, crisp whole-leaf iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and thinly sliced onions with a sauce which seems to consist of  mayonnaise, ketchup and relish.  With cheese, it's only 359 calories.  The fries are made from potatoes that are peeled and diced at each store and cooked fresh in 100% trans-fat free, cholesterol-free vegetable oil.  There are no small, medium, large, or \"biggie\" options.  You just get a well-proportioned cardboard boat of fries.   In-N-Out doesn't use heat lamps or microwaves because the burgers and fries are cooked fresh to order.    In-N-Out is also one of those rare fast-food restaurants that make their milk shakes with real ice-cream.   Their commitment to quality and simplicity translates into great tasting food, and also allows them to keep the prices low.  Being on a student's budget, this is one of my favorite things about In-N-Out Burger.  A hamburger is $175, with cheese it's $2.05.  An order of fries is only $1.35.  And a milkshake is just $1.95.  Another thing about In-N-Out is that there's almost always a long line of cars at the drive-thru when you arrive, but because of the distance between the ordering station and the pick-up window, you rarely have to wait long to order.  The line moves fast and your order is timed to be ready when you get to the pick-up window.  So don't let the long lines deter you.  Because of their great tasting burgers, quality ingredients, and low prices, I'm giving In-N-Out Burger the highest rating I could give to any fast-food restaurant -- 4 stars.",

The crispy bun complimenting the cool lettuce, the special sauce accentuating the fresh tomato, the sweet meat mixing with the salty cheese, all of it coming together in a harmonious medley of flavor thus far unseen on the American fast food landscape - I was smitten. It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double. I was nearly in tears at this meal, it was so transcendently excellent. Those #*&!@'s should hire me as a spokesman.\"  TIP: Do not allow your Cabbie to keep the meter running.  Yes.  My friend and I left the Ditch Fridays pool party at the Palms to go get our second, yes second, Double Double for the day.  We took a cab to the In N Out Burger.

I've been here a few times now, and the only downside to this place is that it's sometimes tough to get a ride back to the hotel you're staying at (assuming you took a cab to get a burger). One alternative is to run across the street to Wild Wild West, but that's definitely hit-or-miss.  As for the food, if you've had In-N-Out anywhere, then you'll know it's terrific (though while its similar to NYC's Shake Shack, its just  a bit different/not as good). Lines here can get pretty long, but overall, the wait's not too long, and you are usually able to find a seat either inside or outside.",

I would not wait in line for 10- 15 min to eat here.            This last time went with out of town guests, I had the 3 by 3 , 3 patties 3 pieces of cheese and fries.  It was alright not great. IMO a plain old burger nothing special.  Animal fries, cheese, grilled onions and thousand island dressing ( whoopee) I don't care for it.  I guess the big selling point of In n Out is the beef is never frozen , it don't really matter to me  , I can't really tell anyway, I mean unless it's freezer burned.  I don't know if Jack in the box, carls jr , mcdonalds, burger king or Wendys freezes their meat , they probably do, and their burgers taste just as good or in so cases better then In n Out . The fries are fresh cut , they have a different texture , not as crisp , or as good as mcdonalds, before U   scoff and write off my review , because I like mcdonalds fries... For the record I'm a Carl's jr's fan .              I gave it 3 stars because it's a decent burger and the price is right .",

    "text": "In N Out is always incredible! While some locations are busier than others, the customer service remains top notch all across the board. Frankly, with how busy they do get (there's ALWAYS a line) I'm amazed with both the food they put out, the time they do it in, the accuracy they do it with AND with a smile?! Really?! You guys are wonderful!  The short wait has a lot to do with the streamlined menu. Fries, shakes in three flavors, regular burger, cheese burger, double cheese burger.. yep. That's about it. Everything off the \"secret menu\" which is no secret, are just variations from the ingredients found on everything else. A simple Google search can pull up the entire menu for you. My cat would be upset if I got In N Out for myself but neglected to get her favorite- the Flying Dutchman.  My usual - a cheeseburger with light spread, grilled onions, add pickles. Their burgers are perfection in a fast food burger. Squishy toasted bun, sweet grilled onions, salty meat, cool tomato slice, crunchy cold iceberg that gets slightly wilted from the heat of the patty.. you just can't beat it. It's an experience!",

Went inside to get it corrected and they made the whole order over.  Whatever, one would think after going in pissed off ( keep in mind this is not the first time a simple order was not made right) when they handed the new order over it was made right.   Okay so we leave get home and they made the same mistake again  HOW HARD IS IT  TO SIMPLY GET A SINGLE BURGER MADE RIGHT!   Again, I just don't understand why people think these burgers are so good.   This store just needs more supervision and training",

    "text": "The panda made it over 29 years without having In-n-Out Burger. Really only because I've lived in states that don't have this place. People say, \"You gotta try this place!\" or \"I swear by this holy spot like some loyal worshiper!\" Um, sure.  I met up with some friends in Vegas for the Panda In-n-Out Initiation.  I pretty much stuck with the basic burger menu this time: Double-double, cheeseburger, and hamburger. I upgraded for an order of animal fries because I've always been intrigued by that. Total came to around $11.50 with tax.  Fresh vegetables are key to a burger. Check. Juicy patty? Check. Oh look, they toasted the bun! Win. The fries, as far as appearance goes, reminded me of McDonald's fries, but at least I saw the people actually placing the potatoes in the potato slicing machine. Can't beat that. All four of us still believe that there must be some type of drug in the animal sauce, because it left me wanting more burgers and fries.  A couple of my friends also got the well-done fries. That and a couple of protein burgers might be in order next time. With more animal sauce, of course.  There's a video of me eating the food. You know, just to document my initiation. (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyWuBDFVgK1w&s=f8fedd698f4f469c41eca6ec047d4f62000263bcbed589eed2f436cd761a1e72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=yWuB...</a>)  Unfortunately, I passed on the shakes this time. The panda can't handle excess dairy. The cheese in the burgers was enough. I do hear the shakes are good, though.  I'm a fan and I'll definitely return. Gotta tackle more of the secret menu next time!",

This is a staple burger joint that I have eaten at since my days living in los angeles, (SFV) and the quality never disappoints! My boyfriend and I go here from time to time to get our burger and animal style fries craving satisfied! Animal style is the way to go on the fries for sure because they are just too plain and dry without the caramelized onions and special sauce. !

    "text": "Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, \"What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on\" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -  \"If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now.\"  Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.  My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..  I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.  In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand.",

My go to order is a 3x1 (3 patties, one cheese) animal style (patty cooked in mustard) with raw onions instead of grilled and no tomato. No matter where I go, I know quality will be the same.   What stands out at this location is the customer service. They are always fast, friendly and efficient. During one of my visits, I was standing near the counter waiting for my to-go order and this angry customer stormed up to the counter. He claimed that his burger was raw and showed the female employee the half eaten burger. I saw the burger and I assure you it was not raw. The female employee was very friendly and patient with the irate customer and gave him a new burger even though he proceeded to eat the old one he was complaining about. Some people are just a**holes, but the female employee took it in stride and kept smiling. Props to her. Also, their drive thru goes by pretty quickly even with the long line of cars.

Cashier was very friendly and patient even when we were indecisive.  Not as busy as we thought it'd be. The line was not consistently long, food was quick and all the condiments were refilled when they were low.   Great place!!",

If you're not from here you definitely need to come to any of their locations and grab a double double with well done fries and a shake. This is probably the best combination I can think of when coming here.   The only thing is you're pro ably and most likely going to have a long wait for the line but that's to be expected with good food and at a great price too. If you go to a generic fast food chain such as McDonald's or Burger King that will just be a disappointment just because missing out on such a good meal should be a crime.   The burger buns are placed on the grill so the edges are nice and toasty. With every bite you can taste the special sauce they lather inside which is the spread and their crispy letter even they put in between the buns. In the end you most definitely won't be disappointed with the burger once waiting that long line.",

I love a good burger but hate the feeling of eating a giant bun as it subtracts from the flavor.  I devoured my meal and went about my day.

We waited in a long line, but it only took about five minutes for us to get to the front. The price for the quality of the burger is amazing!

This lady caused a scene which started by her raising her voice when she was offered a water cup. After paying, she sat and waited for her food, searching her receipt for something to complain about. Once she found that her receipt said eat in instead of to go (or at least it came off as that's what she was complaining about), she went up to the counter, yelling at anyone who would listen. Nolan and Gage handled the situation perfectly and were very kind to her all throughout. I am a hospitality manager here in Vegas, and the customer service at In-N-Out never ceases to amaze me.",

Good start to the day!   We make it there and sit in the drive through. There was an employee in the parking lot with a computerized handheld thing taking orders. I told him I'd never been before so he explained what they have...burgers, burgers, burgers. I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds!   I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar.   I wish they would put one of these on the strip somewhere so that I could go without spending $20 on a cab ride and $6 on food but I think for my first experience it was SO worth the money and I'd do it again in a second!",

I roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there.

A brief 2 minute wait and our food is ready to go.   Here's a list of what we ordered:  - Cheeseburger, Protein style. - Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion.  - Fries, Animal style - Regular fries - Chocolate Shake  When we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.  On a side note: While I was waiting, I did notice they had a lot of workers standing around waiting to make food... The problem is that it was slow so there was no orders to make!  Of course, pictures included!!",

Thankful that they're open and I'll get a tasty treat soon! Thanks In n Out!  so worth the wait!",

You can get singles, doubles, triples, etc.  And there are different ways of having your sandwich prepared, too, but you have to look up the \"secret\" preparation styles, such as Animal Style, before coming, because they are not posted on the menu.",

Then I thought it was in the Tropicana. Not True. Apparently it's on Tropicana Blvd across the highway. After 20 miles of walking that day (no joke) we decided to take a taxi there to get our bearings back.  $10 for a taxi ride and $11 for the food, it was still totally worth it.  Animal fries are to die for. Especially after having walked all day. And I was SO hungry.  We came here at 3 pm and it was still PACKED! It took a while to get our food, but again, totally worth it. The burgers are very fresh and delicious. But I cannot stress how awesome the animal style fries are. I wish I lived in an In-n-Out state just so I could get them on a regular basis.   YUM!",

For 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries, a vanilla milkshake and 1 order of animal-styled fries (with grilled onions, thousand island dressing and cheese), our total added up to less than $15 and it fed 3 very hungry hannahs - stuffed and contented!  If you're a first-timer, you will find the menu a little too simple - at least that was what I thought 3 years ago when I was new in Vegas. Don't be too quick to judge. What makes In-n-out so interesting is the fact that they have a secret menu (envision a burger entitled 'the flying dutchman'!) and you can have it at a snap of a finger. Everything is served fresh, all the braches I've been to have been spotless and the staff always have a bright smile on their faces. At the same time, you get this whole 60s diner feel that I instantly associate with Johnny Rockets (and thus the comparison) every time I enter, only not with the dancing staff.   Great place to take the family after church service, or hang out with a group of friends. Their milkshake is made from ice-cream by the way, so just a heads-up, sipping it through a straw may not be the easiest thing in the world.",

And I'll eat every last bite in a matter of a couple minutes, it's that good. Sometimes I add on one of their awesome chocolate shakes. I've never been disappointed with an In-N-Out burger & fries -- it always tastes fresh and seems like a fast food option that's not as bad for you. (Is that possible? Maybe that's just what I tell myself)  Also, this location has been pretty busy every time I've been there, so prepare to wait. But don't worry, it's worth it!

We noticed that the place was not overly advertised in the decor; its simplicity is enough to get the message across that you're here for the food and not for the decor.   We noticed that they really do have a system in place. We saw how a team of people really gel and work together. It was welcoming to see how right they all work together and the care they take to make everything.   We saw them slicing the potato to be cooked fresh. How the hamburgers were being built with precision. It was just amazing to see.   The food was really good. We ordered a double cheeseburger that was really tasty. A simple touch of toasting one side of the bun gave our burger that nice crunchy taste (not too much but just enough) where others just get soggy, especially towards the end of the burger, not this place.   If you have the opportunity, make this a place that you simply must try.   We're just sorry they don't have one near where we live.",

I have never had anyone look like they didn't want to be there, and I have never had a bad burger.  For a fast food burger, these are the cream of the crop.  Real meat, onions raw or grilled, melted cheese, awesome fries (until they get cold) and a secret menu that will please nearly everone.  You can even get grilled cheese, animal style, protein style, animal fries, 2X2, 3X3, 4X4 or X x X.  Order a neopolitan shake to wash it down.  They will give you a placemat for your car and they usually have cool merchandise.  There are no kids meals here.  The buns could be better, and if the fries get cold, they lose their appeal.

The order came in about 5 minutes which is pretty fast for an In-n-Out based on my previous experiences.  The shake was very good but I made the mistake of drinking it on the way home before I ate and I got pretty full by the time I got home.

I like how you can customize your order into your preference and their spread is delicious on the burger and fries.   The drives they line was pretty long today and took almost 20 minutes to get through. I customized my order so maybe that's why it was a bit of a wait. I chose a number two with grilled onions, chopped peppers, and no tomatoes. I also ordered the fries well done with a lemonade to drink.   This time my fried came out as ordered and I was able to get two packets of spread to put on my fried instead of ketchup. The service overall was good and once you get to the windows to pay and get your food it's actually quick.",

I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper.  ***Update - we were all drinking and had the munchies which makes this experience that much more pain",

Luckily it wasn't too hot so the staff member seemed fine but I do hope they were rotating members. If you go through the drive thru you can actually see the kitchen through the glass. Glass was pretty clean and everyone working had on a hair net and was wearing gloves. The staff members were organized and it seemed like they were having fun due to the laughter within their face.

I've been to every single In-N-Out in Las Vegas. I reviewed all of them, except the location off Maryland Parkway.  Don't worry, that one is coming soon.  I do have my favorite locations and this is not one of them.  This is one of those locations that I will avoid only because it's always busy, out of the way, and the parking lot is crazy.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is efficient.  You can tell who is familiar with this In-N-Out and who isn't.  The rookies will park close to the entrance thinking that they found a great parking spot only to be blocked by the cars in the drive-thru line.  I counted 27 cars ahead of me the last time I was here.  That's crazy!  That's a lot of In-N-Out fans.  Overall, I'm one of them.  You can't go wrong with In-N-Out.

When I finally made my way back to civilization, I was what I like to call \"Angry Hungry,\" Or, \"hangry.\" Meaning, if I didn't eat anything soon I would have to hurt someone.*   And even though I had reservations at a lovely French bistro later that evening, I knew what I needed, right then and there: a Double-Double, Animal Style.   It was served with a genuine smile, which I rudely ignored in favor of immediately tearing into that burger like it had called me Stuart.** It was animalistic, indeed. And this thing was not only the best fast-food burger I'd ever tasted, but also a damn good deal at $3 and change.   I don't always eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer In-N-Out. __________  *Or more likely, weep uncontrollably until my mommy made me a snack. **I hate being called Stuart.",

Lastly the grilled onions were not grilled enough to take the crunch out of them.   None of this I expect from this company. This location has a company store and warehouse on site so I would expect the standard to be at it's Highest level.

We have tried this place on more than one occasion and feel it's just a burger.  The menu is short and sweet, so no big deal there, the price of the combo's are good, the hand cut fries are crispy and fresh.  We like to get the burgers with the onions, and the fries \"animal style\".  It's always busy, clean and if you're lucky, you can find a seat.",

I might have contributed this to my amazing charm, but I realized she was just unable to comprehend the order as simple as it was... One more reason she should stay  in school.",

The guy that took my order was polite and explained my options. I placed my order for a cheeseburger combo animal style no pickles to go. There were 2 people in front of me prior to my order.  After waiting 25 minutes my good was finally ready. On the way home I decided to try a few fries because I was hungry before I got to In n Out but at this point I was starving. The fries were cold!!!! When I get home 5 minutes later the burger and rest of the fries were cold too! How is it possible to be forced to wait and then get cold food??? Terrible experience. Change the name to In and Eventually Out with Cold Food.",

This is just a step up from anything I've experienced in Orlando, FL, another hot spot for high expectations in customer service. The only negative is sometimes have to wait a bit for food as the place is so packed. But I suppose that is something to expect if people keep coming back.",

Of course my preference has always been In&Out Burger because of the simplicity of the burger.  It's not fancy and has a whirlwind of grilled burger flavors.  Because of the topic at hand, I ended up craving for In&Out.  I chose this particular location because the line isn't ridiculously long like all the other locations.  I normally have to wait for a little more than a half hour before I get my food.  Here, it is what it's named, In and Out.  You're in to get your order, and out in no more than ten minutes.  I don't know how long this will last a people will more than likely catch on.  Service is efficient, and food is always cooked to perfection.  Fries can be sometimes too dry for my liking.  But, I prefer it over any other fries.",

Just finished my burger, now I'm picking off the fries that are too short to be considered \"whole\", yet too big to be considered \"crumbs\". A task with much deliberation, not enough time in my day to properly categorize them, but someone must do it.  I eat the last fry, the last dip into ketchup, I look up to see a family sitting across from me. The typical nuclear family, two parents, two children. I see that the father and mother are looking, shocked & DISGUSTED, in the same direction...directly to the left of me at the ketchup dispenser. I turn my head and I look as well, something I also regret doing, an image that will haunt me until my very last breath upon this planet...  Directly to the left of me, I see a young lady hunched over the dispenser, drinking directly from the ketchup dispenser.   Now, when I say drinking, I don't mean. 'drinking like a waterfall from your friend's bottled water'...  I mean, 'drinking like a newborn calf to mother'...  LIPS ALL UP ON THE DISPENSER, NOT A DROP TO BE WASTED!  I look at the parents, then back to her, then back to the parents. It was like watching actors in a 1920s silent movie about the horrors of globalism...  For some reason, 'Vesti La Giubba' by Luciano Pavarotti played in my head.  Time slowed down. The outside world did not matter now. NOTHING, mattered now.  All that I saw was this being, this figure, with no concept of right or wrong.   With no second thought for spectators, doing, truly, what they believed to be right and just.  In a strange way, it was beautiful. In a *very* wrong way, it was still beautiful.  A full minute later, the woman then, *unbothered*, lifts her head from the dispenser, looks to the ceiling...  looks at the halogen lights...  (defiantly) looks to god...  and lets out a very loud,  \"AHH!\"  As if she just took a sip from the fountain of youth.  It was far from it...  This evening, sugar, vinegar, & tomato juice were the blood coursing through her veins.   She did not fail however, For the image I have of this legend will live forever within my head...  I picked up my things and left. Questioning everything I know, everything I have come to love, everything that I have cherished as holy.  One question remains...  How many more like her exist?  Some questions were made not to be answered...",

In-N-Out makes a better burger than five guys and does it with a better environment and service.  While both have pretty strict quality control standards, In-N-Out FEELS like a better experience.  First off, it's filled with people, at all hours.  We did the drive through one time and they've got a guy out there taking orders, making sure it's right and the way you want it.  I get the Double Double, it's two patties, it's not overwhelming. The rest of my family rotates between cheeseburgers and grilled cheeses.  The grilled cheese is 'hidden menu' but is seriously worth a shot.  It's all the stuff from a burger without the meat.  So lettuce, sauce, tomato, onion if you want, etc.",

I ordered a bog-standard double double meal. The burger was delicious. Fresh vegetables and a super soft bun. Happy to see the cheese was melted too. The fries weren't special at all. They were bland and fairly tough. When I think of a French fry, I think of a light crispy delight. Their french fries are pretty far from that, their dense with no fluffiness at all. It's a little like eating cardboard.",

I definitely feel like a valued customer. The menu is very simple. They have a single or double hamburger, fries, soft drinks, and milkshakes. That's it. Don't look for variations of burgers or chicken sandwiches, this exactly what it's called...In and Out Burger! To be truthful, I don't care for the fries, I think they're lacking flavor. Not to mention the last two times I ordered take out, mine were cold. I don't live more than a couple miles away. To be fair, try dining in first. The burgers have a special sauce that is the icing on the cake,  it's not too sweet, but it offsets the raw onions perfectly. To satisfy your late night cravings, they're open until 1:30 am.",

We pulled up to a packed parking lot as people were fighting for parking spots.  When we walked in the line was so long we thought, damn this is gonna be and in-n-stay rather than in-n-out burger place.  Wrong.  They were so fast along with the diners because tables were like parking spots, loads of people and cars and not a lot of seating or parking spots.  We spotted a table and downed our burgers and fries.  It reminded me of a Johnny Rockets Restaurant if you have ever been there but it was much better!!  For under $5 bucks a person, you could have a tasty burger with fries and a drink and its really good.  They apparently butcher their own meat so I was told.  At least the company which is family owned butchers their own meat.  If you are in Las Vegas and needing a quick bite, definitely stop by In-N-Out Burgers!!  It was totally worth it!!  Cheers and Enjoy!!",

Depending on my hinge level I get a Neapolitan shake  Yes, the caloric value of this is extremely high but its innout I love tho place!  Estephanie, dulce, and nigel are all amazing! They already know what I want and exactly how I want it. They are so polite and awesome! Thank you guys!",

    "text": "So maybe I'm easy to please.. but In N Out is my personal favorite burger spot in Vegas.  It's actually my favorite \"fast food\" restaurant.  Parking:   is good, and this location's pretty safe. Star 1 :]  Cleanliness:  When it's not super busy & under staffed, In N Out is usually well maintained (including the restroom) so.. Star 2 :]  Service:  Staff members are always well mannered & greets always with a smile.. Star 3! :]  Food:  Double double with fries cooked to tasty goodness.. & a neopolitan shake from real ice cream? Star 4.  Atmosphere:  It's casual, and I love the laid back feeling when I'm going to devour something tasty. Star 5.  I wish there was a location near Red Rock Casino! ;D",

I have been there when it is 10-15 cars deep but I have never had to wait more than 10 min.  The employees are always very friendly and upbeat.  Then there is the actual food...I'm not a fast food fan AT ALL but this takes fast food to a whole new level!  Everything is very fresh and incredibly tasty.  I think In-N-Out is a particularly great choice to cure a hangover after a long night of partying in Vegas and you can't beat the prices, even in comparison to lower quality fast food joints.",

Fresh ingredients, never frozen patties, fresh cut veggies and fries made to order, and great shakes. At a incredibly affordable price for the top quality food you're getting. The wait is usually longer, but that's how it should be. Real food should not be made at microwave speeds.  They also have the infamous secret menu.   My usual order: #3 (hamburger, double meat, whole grilled onion, and fries well-done)  Simple. Fresh. Cheap. Convenient.  This is the pinnacle of conventional fast-food establishments.",

    "text": "My first review on yelp! and in-n-out is definitely worthy of it.  i was stoked to hear that a new in-n-out formed on trop and fort apache, an in-n-out less than 10 min drive from my house! (other in-n-outs i would have to drive no less than 15 min). so i decided to check this new location out yesterday. it was my first time eating in-n-out this year since i was in philly attending school. I had my fair share of descent quality fast food restaurants in philly (five guys, 500 degrees) but none of them come close to in-n-out status...whenever i would go to a fast food restaurant in philly, the in-n-out song would always play in my head...\"in-n-out...IN-N-OOOUUUTTT! thats what a hammmburgers allll about!!\" thats how much i missed it...  anyways, this is what i usually get: double-double, animal style (chopped and grilled onions) with extra lettuce and tomatoes (no extra charge), fries, and a coke. if im in the mood for it, i ask for animal style fries (chopped/grilled onion and their \"special sauce\" added to the fries) and a strawberry milkshake. i also usually ask for extra spread (their packaged \"special sauce\") and chili peppers (if you like some spice to your meal). their buns are always perfectly toasted, their meat patties are always flavorful and juicy, their vegetables are always fresh and tasty, and their special sauce is to DIE for...and the fact that around $5 will get you a meal makes me think...why even think about going to another fast food joint?  if you're the type who can't read long posting like this, ill try to make it as simple as possible: - ask me what my favorite movie of all time? I DONT KNOW - my favorite song of all time? NO CLUE - my favorite fast food joint of all time? EASY. IN-N-OUT  thats what a hamburgers all about",

A line of cars wrapping around the building, out to the street. We still couldn't have waited in line any longer than 10 minutes. They whipped us (and our cab driver - thank you!) through the line in no time, with the outside order-taker helping immensely. She had no problem with the special orders (Tip: try the chopped chilis - incredible on a burger!)  I'm not usually one for buying into aura as much as I am just the food, but this place has something special about it. It's nearly a badge of honor to order something on their \"secret\" menu. But if the food sucked, nothing would save it. Thankfully, In-N-Out is the real deal, and goddamn it now I'm hungry.",

    "text": "In-N-Out has a loyal following and for good reason. Unlike other places, when you hear the name In-N-Out, you can expect good fresh food.  There are 2 classes of burgers, the thin patties, simple, clean flavors which In-N-Out serves. Then you have the restaurant gourmet burgers that tends to be big beef patties with lots of ingredients, more complicated, flavors aren't clean though. Both are still delicious. This is like arguing over Deep Dish Pizza vs Thin Crust pizza. Note that to pull off the simple flavors, it requires to have really good ingredients, which includes good meat patties, cheese, and veggies. In-N-Out usually does this well.  Like most other In-N-Out locations you usually will get great food and service. But the couple of times I went, I have some not so perfect service and food for In-N-Out standards. Despite this, it is still a lot better than some other fast food places.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, burgers, shakes, or fries. But things get interesting when you start ordering off the secret menu.   What I order now is: 3x2 Protein Style No Salt w/ Grilled Onions and Animal Style Fries. 1 less cheese makes it less filling. The lack of salt keeps the burger from drying out. The protein style is really so you can taste the ingredients, since the buns just get in the way. If executed properly, you really taste the burger and won't be disappointed.",

The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at midnight.  Decided to park and order takeout from the counter.  Ordered a Double-Double animal style, animal style fries well done, and a Neapolitan shake.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be filled so it's not necessarily fast food.  Took the order with me and went to my hotel to check in so I didn't get to dig into everything for another half hour.  The burger was very good.  Tasty and juicy, a decent size offering and very affordable.  The fries were another story.  I wanted to try them well done and by the time I got to them they were ROCK HARD.  Now I'm not sure if this was because I waited a half hour to dig into them or they are normally this way when you order them well done.  Even ordering them animal style did not soften them up.  I wasn't impressed with the fries the first time I went to In-N-Out so I guess my opinion has gotten worse.  The shake was good, nothing to go WOW about.  Overall I enjoyed In-N-Out.  The burger was very good.  Way better then McD's, BK or Wendys.  I say it's on par with 5 Guys which also makes a decent burger but whose fries are WAY better.",

The food is good has always here. This is the first place I tried Animal Style on my burger and fries. So good!!! Service is pretty good as well.

You can taste the quality difference in their product compared to any other fast food restaurant.  1 is enough to fill you up. Trust me.

With a tag line of, \"Quality you can taste\" you better deliver an amazing product and In-N-Out goes way beyond my expectations.   FOOD: 5/5 stars  This has to be one of if not the best tasting fast food burger in America.  The flavors of the cheese, lettuce, sauce and hamburger work so well together and the bun is just melt in your mouth, double D delicious.  The fries actually taste like fresh cut potatoes, not that mashed together again fake fries a lot of fast food joints serve.   my double double with animal style fries! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=FT9xeB10CA3NEO03SwdIqw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_W...</a>  PRICE: 5/5 stars  Fast food is suppose to be cheap, when you start paying over $10 for a fast food meal for a processed product that is not healthy for you, something has gone wrong with America.  In-N-Out has very cheap reasonable prices for the quality of ingredients that they use.  When you actually taste their burgers, you'll realize how much better it tastes than the big fast food american chains.  You won't be disappointed.  VARIETY: 4/5 stars  Okay so if you're looking for a chicken wrap, chicken bowl, salad, or hot dogs, etc.. LOOK ELSEWHERE.. This is not sonic with their 128,000 choices for drinks, this is In-N-Out where you come here for a damn good hamburger and fries.  What they lack in variety they make up in their secret menu.  You can take a look at the link below for a list of the secret menu, I will give my caveat here by saying i have not tried to order all the different secret menus, but if i lived in a place where i could eat In-N-Out regularly, I'd try to get them all..   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.badmouth.net%2Fin-n-outs-secret-menu%2F&s=d3d79b37eac3e50a9dcefb9551a73f1805bacadb310180839386ec38425936e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">badmouth.net/in-n-outs-s...</a>  The In-N-Out menu! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=VxNLm-e2BbW2PXpvR89B9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_W...</a>  SERVICE: 4/5 stars  Good service, the place does get busy and so wait times may get a little long but most people will wait for \"quality they can taste\".  The staff never hesitates to fulfill the needs of a customer and the facilities are kept tidy and clean  INTANGIBLES: 5/5 stars  I've eaten a lot of fast food and I can honestly say that In-N-Out is the only place that I do not feel so guilty after eating a meal.  Yes it is still a burger and yes they still deep fry their potatoes but at least there are no additives in their food.  You are eating a quality product for a super cheap price.  In-N-Out - simply the best. nuff sed.",

They are always smiling and quick to get your order to you. I would recommend the animal style burger and the animal style fries! Look up the secret menu if you have not! The food at this location is always fresh and tastes great every time.

At 2pm on a Tuesday, the drive through line was about 2-3 cars and inside there was only about 3-4 people in front of us. No problems ordering or finding a seat. I am glad we ventured out to this location.   Ambiance: Typical cookie cutter location, which is perfectly fine. There was plenty of parking in the shared shopping center and it was easy to access from the freeway. Nice.   Food: Double double animal style - perfect. I love the extra veggies and pickles and how wet the burger is. Double double w/ raw onion - excellent. Loved the flavor of the raw onions. Was a little dry in comparison to the animal style. Maybe I should get animal style with raw onions?! Animal fries - delicious as always.  To escape the crazies, come to this location. It is worth the drive.",

The bottom line is they win more than loose and based upon that they're a first round HOF (hall of fame) nominee.  Other 'burger joints claim you can have it your way. But can you really?  This time around got the Double-double with grilled onions and chopped peppers, hold the lettuce & tomato. A grilled cheese. That's right!  Give me a cheeseburger, hold the burger, with tomatoes and onion. My way all the way! Top it off with fresh French fries, Coke and vanilla shake and you have a little piece of nirvana served in a small red plastic tray.   Lastly, at $12 for all that food In-N-Out blows away the new-to-the-west coast \"quality\" burger joints and their inflated prices.   For full disclosure, being from SoCal I am completely biased towards this chain.  However, quality is quality no matter where one hails from.",

    "text": "I have eaten In-N-Out Burgers several times, but fail to see the almost cult-like following. Don't get me wrong, every burger has been well made, tasty, with fresh ingredients. If in the mood for a burger and an In-N-Out is nearby, I will stop in and grab some quick grub.  But this is not the best burger in the known Universe by a long shot.  My less than informed guess as to the fascination is because of three key reasons: (1) So many people have fond memories of eating In-N-Out as a child; (2) The \"secret\" menu and ordering makes many feel like they are privy to a secret society; (3) Those on the east coast have often only heard of this chain restaurant through office conversation, and through legends passed down by elders at night by the fire.  Oh, there might be a fourth reason; many think it is a good burger, but are afraid to take on In-N-Out fanatics by suggesting there are other equally good burgers available to our civilized society.  Now, while the burgers are fresh and good, the french fries (not animal fries or some other version) are boring and in my opinion as a three generation french fry expert are not very good.",

    "text": "Ok, as a New Yorker with burger joints galore in this city, have heard about \"In-N-Out Burgers\" on the West Coast for years now, how it was this irresistible ultimate burger joint place. So, on 1st visit to Vegas, made it a priority to visit an In-N-Out to see for myself what all the hype was about. And to be honest, the burger really kinda fell flat. Or let's just say, it was OK, but definitely no WOW, not much taste to it or anything to write home about nor warrant another visit anytime soon. Though, I will say, for the price and for being fast-food, it's one of the better burgers on the market. But would say, it ranks right in line with Shake Shack burgers, but cheaper. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly and there was no big line at this location and the menu is simple, burgers, fries of a few variations and shakes/soda. So go if you must to check it off your bucket list and judge for yourself but for me, it's one of those \"been there, done that\" experiences.",

Instead of sitting at a table I sat at the counter like tables where I had a front row seat to watch all the action.

It doesn't have all the crowds and as with many other locations, the customers flow well, so there isn't really a problem finding a seat. Even if you have a large group.  The best thing about In-n-Out is their basic menu. Burger, fries, and a drink. The product sells itself. Of course I like their burger, but my favorite is their fries. How do they get them so light and airy?  It's just a great place for friends to gather.",

    "text": "I've know about In n Out burgers for such a long time, so when I saw one during my first trip to the united stated I wasted no time in making my way over there!   The place is always busy with people queueing up to order there burgers, while orders are being shouted out for pickup. I order the number 1, which is double pattie, double cheese, along with the secret menu option Animal Style, which gives you grilled onions!  After a few minutes wait while filling up my coke cup, I picked up the tray which had the fries and burger on it. The first thing I noticed was the way in which the burger was wrapped in paper keeping everything together. A very nice touch to keeping everything in one place and not falling out. The taste was very good! The fries were crispy and fresh. A truly delicious burger that was warmly welcomed after getting off a flight from London.  I'm not a huge fan of the highly processed white bread they use for burgers in America, but when in Rome!  Probably my favourite of all the American fast food burger offerings!",

    "text": "I've always heard about In-N-Out from friends who have visited the west coast (particularly California) and I was happy to find out that there was one in Las Vegas while I was there. My friends and I actually wanted to walk from our hotel (Monte Carlo) to the In-N-Out in the area when we first arrived in Vegas. We decided it wasn't a good idea and we'd make our venture there another day since we were already too hungry at the time. Well the next day, we took a cab from our hotel to In-N-Out which was basically less than a 5-minute ride. Our cab drive did warn us about this specific franchise because of the long lines but we decided we'd brave it. The line and wait wasn't too horrible and we got our food within 15 minutes. I ordered the double double and fries with a vanilla milkshake. It was pretty great. Next time I'll order 3x3 and the fries with cheese (I know animal style is probably best but I'm not a fan of all the stuff they put in it unfortunately). I was also expecting them to charge a hefty price but it was a cheap and good meal. Definitely gotta try it when you're in the west coast and close to one. But for some reason I'm more partial to Shake Shack in NYC even though it's so much more expensive but it could just be because I can't completely compare the two side by side or that i'm biased to the east coast. I'll definitely come back and have some of these burgers again if I'm in the west coast.",
