    "text": "I ate here 4 days ago. I only give it 4 stars because its too pricey to eat for a regular meal. My order alone was $25. Imho flavorful rice, an alright steak flank side dish, nice table setting and an occasional live band doesn't wow me enough for the price.. I came late in the day before closing. I reccomend being there when Sun is there. She seems to make sure everything is perfect.  Nice portion sizes with the $11 pineapple fried rice. The matcha green tea ice cream tastes barely like matcha. Try a Starbucks matcha green tea anything, or buy Matcha powder like me and you'll see what i mean.  Their beef jerky is fantastic. You can eat alot of it just from sampling. (When Sun is there atleast haha) When Sun is there I'd give it 4.5 stars because she's an absolutely amazing manager. You have an option of 1-10 on food (spicyness). But this just means more red pepper powder and flakes of it i beleive. I wish i could say better things but this time it wasn't near as good as last.",

Her dishes are very good. We got red curry, tom yum with fish fillet and chicken satay. All were excellent. I was so full but really wanted to keep going! Of course, I had to get some of her beef jerky. Personally, the lime flavor is my all time favorite. It is so tangy and so good!! My mom and I also ordered the mango sticky rice and we were in absolute heaven. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to try more of her food!",

Despite all this we figured maybe they were having some staffing issues or something. We decided to give them one last try. After applying the order on eat24, we received a call from eat24 customer service (45 minutes later) informing us that they wanted to add an additional $4 delivery fee on top of the existing $4 delivery fee. Well, we won't be ordering from Sun's ever again. Good luck!",

    "text": "In a blighted little part of the NW valley lies a ray of sunshine in the Thai cuisine of Sun's Thai Food & Jerky, a discovery I made on a grey, cold afternoon. I love Thai food and I love great service coupled with a charming ambiance and Sun's possesses all of these features. It actually made me feel like I was on vacation!  I had the yellow chicken curry and chicken larb. The presentations were minimalistic but elegant. The crumbles of chicken larb flavors were resplendent with bold chilis, bright lime, and mint juxtaposed with the crisp cabbage, just wish there was more of the latter. The curry was a comforting bowl of meat balanced with large chunks of perfectly cooked potatoes and carrots. Jasmine rice was served separately so I could have a customized balance of creamy curry and rice.   Giant chalkboards featured the day's specials and a nice offering of international (Asian) beers, and across from the board was a small stage where apparently live music starts at 7 pm. Two big screen HD TVs play what appears to be cooking and travel shows featuring Thailand, but the audio was off so I couldn't be sure.   Overall, I was really impressed with the quaint atmosphere, the menu selections as well as my choices. Most of the time I find my way to Commercial Center which is quite the haul for my favorite Pad Thai and rad na, but now I will have a closer place to visit! So glad I had the nerve to venture into a bit of a dodgy area because I was rewarded with the warmth of Sun's Thai Food & Jerky.",

I thought I'd be safe with getting a \"medium\" spice level - Boy was I wrong. I about burned my face off! So please, should you dine at Sun's, order a level or two below what you would normally get for spiciness level. Online ordering through Eat24 for Sun's is Not Spicy, Mild, Medium, Spicy, and Very Spicy.     PAD KEE MAO aka Drunken Noddles (8.95): My medium level spiciness was so spicy, I couldn't drink a coke with my meal! I was forced to drink a glass of water. My nose was running and my mouth was on fire. Basically, I couldn't really enjoy my meal and eat as much food as I wanted. I got this entree with tofu, which wasn't cooked the way I like it. It was fried. Of course I would have liked the dish MUCH better if I would have ordered it with a \"mild\" spiciness level. 2.5/5  *** It is exasperatingly difficult to find a place with tofu I actually like. So far Le Thai, Tuk Tuk, Teriyaki Madness, Benihana's, and Geisha Steakhouse are the only places I can find where I like the tofu. ***    GARLIC & PEPPERED CHICKEN ($8.95): My husband got his entree at a 'mild' spiciness level. He said it was perfect. At first, he complained his meal was small but ended up saying it was the perfect amount after finishing. Entrees come with a side of rice. 4/5  SERVICE: Our order took less than 15 minutes to be prepared and the employees were extremely friendly to us while we waited inside. My husband sampled some beef jerky and wants to buy a bag on our next visit.       Worth a Return Visit? I'd come back but have learned my lesson about the unusual spiciness level dished out at Sun's Thai Food & Jerky.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #79",

After 2 hours of waiting, I called the restaurant to see the status of the food, as it had been ages. The lady told me that the guy was on his way to pick up my food now, and it would be another 15 to 20 minutes before my food arrive... Making it well past two hours after ordering... Then she gave me excuses that they were shorthanded and very busy... I finally offered to come grab the food and when I arrived, my food wasn't even hot anymore... They did give me my delivery and tip money back, after I asked for it, but wish they would have at least given me a call to let me know that everything was so delayed. Think about it folks when ordering delivery. Hope the food is good when I get home!",

The usual eats:  Spicy Beef salad-- made a mistake and ordered it as a spicy level 5 one time and it was extremely difficult to eat due to the spice level. From than on I order it as a level 2 which is perfection. A lot of beef and not enough veggies but still very good.   Mint chicken-- some Thai places use ground chicken for this dish which is what I'm used to but this place uses real chicken chunks. The amount of chicken they put in this dish is greatly appreciated. Great in favors and the mint doesn't over power the chicken at all.   seafood tum yum soup- Great burst of flavors but not enough seafood. I would like to find more fish, clams, and shrimp than garlic and tomato chunks. I do like the actual soup/broth, it's pretty dang good, but for paying $16 they need to make it worth our buck.   The people that work here are really really nice. It is family owned so you often see kids in there watching TV or helping the adults. There is also a mini stage area where there are instruments and I think karaoke. I've never been here while that was active but it looks like good time.   They are also well known for their beef jerky. Ask them for a sample, they'll be more than happy to give you taste.",

The vegetables were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was of high quality and no chewy pieces at all.  The sauce was not watery, as is common at Thai restaurant in USA, but of perfect consistency and flavor.  I did not specify a spiciness level but it was about a 3-4 on a scale from 1-10, which is exactly the way I like it.  I'm sure they will adjust the spiciness to your liking if you ask.  The food came out piping hot, it looked very appealing to the eye, smelt great and the portion was generous (dinner size).  All the workers at the restaurant appeared to be of Thai origin and they are hitting it out of the ballpark.  This will be one of my weekly \"go-to\" restaurants for sure since I love Thai food.",

A great example is Bajarong Thai, while the presentation and good is great the 10 scale heat had no heat to me. Now suns has the typical 1-10 scale heat but the heat is nice on a 10. My mouth tingled and I broke a sweat while eating. I tried the Red curry w/ chicken, Thai beef jerky, crab rangoons. The beef jerky is actually cooked beef jerky with a crispy shell and mouth watering everything else.. It is served with a salty dipping sauce. The crab rangoons are not as fluffy as others I have tried but nice and crispy with a delicious sauce. The red curry was a huge bowl served with a plate of rice. I got my curry a 10 on the heat scale and it was great, hearty and delicious.  My only complaint might be the environment.. It's not so much a complaint as it's sort of cheesy. There is always club lights on with music playing from the early 90's .. Not bad but it definitely has a karaoke bar feel.  Go check this place out the staff is all family and everyone was super nice.",

They are all hard working individuals who are always making sure food comes out best as it possibly can, almost to perfection. I enjoy there Beef noodle soup, it came on a big bowl of amazing taste of beef and soup, enough to make you full. They have karaoke nights which I don't remember which days they have them on but it sure entertains some folks there especially some customers would even participate which makes it a welcoming stage to anyone which is pretty awesome. You'll have a couple of disoriented singers that may participate but they may either be drunk or doing it for fun! But that's karaoke for you, its meant to be fun! Atmosphere is dark but I love the settings, honestly I would love a little more light however, it doesn't bother me greatly, maybe some will find it difficult to see. Beef jerkies are so good especially the spicy ones. They advertise their Beef Jerkies every Sunday at the Craig Ranch Park at a Farmer's Market event where you have all these different vendors selling their food, products etc... Overall, I enjoy coming here when I am hungry for Beef noodle soup or Pad-Thai noodles.",

    "text": "Wife and I wandered into this place craving some Thai food. There are quite a few choices nearby and this one by far surpasses them all!  Service: The service is great. The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly and punctual. I've seen them go out of their way to deliver food and make meals correct. They don't skimp when you say you want it spicy so buyer be advised. Don't say you want it super hot and then wuss out it ruins the restaurant for everyone. They can get backed up with orders but be patient the food is worth it.  Atmosphere: Although I rarely dine in the few times I have, everything is well taker care of and clean. The tables are clean and not sticky and the cutlery is clean and not cloudy. The restaurant itself has a stage and a bar (that may or may not serve liquor not sure). The stage is for events and karaoke but haven't seen them having music etc. so possibly something that was left there from the previous establishment. There is a significant amount of Thai decor so it really adds to the experience. Overall humble and clean.  Food: The food is great. Everything I've ordered from the; whole fried fish to eggplant to fried rice to tom yun gong and etc. has come out fresh tasting and well seasoned. The Thai flavors of sour, slightly sweet and SPICY really shines through. I love that I can say I want it spicy 10 out of 10 and I get exactly that. Not some watered down \"well I put a lot of chili sauce in there for you\" hot, I'm talking I added a few fresh thai chili peppers prepare to burn. I hate that most Thai restaurants throttle back the spice to appease their Americanized audience. My wife is Thai and loves her food spice level LAVA as do I. So in short if you're looking for authentic tasty and fresh thai food then this is the place to be!  -Side note: the thai jerky is also delicious. It's not your typical jerky because they tie all the spices normally used in their dishes into the jerky. It is unique and tasty.  -Side note2: Dishes I reorder again and again; fried catfish with curry sauce, eggplant, sum tam, pad thai- with spice (different flavor than your typical sweet pad thai much better imo)  tl;dr: great restaurant. family owed and operated. friendly. clean dining experience. genuine thai food. don't skimp on spiciness so beware. try the jerky.",

    "text": "Sun's is a new Thai restaurant in the near North Las Vegas area where I work, and I welcome it!  The staff is very welcoming and full of smiles and professional service.  The inside consists of your usual Thai restaurant decor, and has a fresh cleanness about it.  The karaoke stage had drums and guitars set up and ready to go.  On to the food!  I ordered the jerky ($7.95) and the red curry ($8.95) on the server's recommendation.  I found that the jerky was a little tough, but the flavor was nice.  The sauce, other than the basil, was pretty bland and rather useless against the stronger flavors of the jerky.  It did pair well with the red curry, however.      The red curry was pretty good.  For a subtly flavored red curry, it had a nice balance and a unique creamy flavor.  It was a very watery curry, but had well balanced flavor so it worked out.  The green and red peppers were pretty juicy (P.A. has raised the bar here), and the beef was tender.  There was lots of bamboo, but not to the annoying amounts that Archi's does.  It easily served two people and I had to order an extra rice to finish it (they didn't charge me for the extra rice).  I ordered a 7/10 heat level and it was moderately spiced for my tastes.      All in all Sun's is on the upper 3's for me, so rounded up to a 4 for this review.  It is a welcomed addition to places to eat around my work.  A bit more Americanized, Sun's offers a little extra quality in their food than some other Thai restaurants.",

    "text": "I was happy to see that a real Thai place (not a chinese joint that sells Thai food) is finally closer to my place in NLV.  It's a small quiet place that I'm sure gets pretty loud when people get \"jiggy\" on their stage with Karaoke and also instruments for their live band. It's family owned and when our group of 6 entered we were greeted by the wife who is very very friendly.  After our waitress/The Wife brought out our drink orders, she thoroughly answered every question we had, even as redundant as some of those questions might have been. Most places that I've been to, you can tell that the waiter/waitress gets a little annoyed when he/she has to answer the same sort of question. We got our orders within a reasonable amount of time and was always politely asked if we needed anything. We never had to hunt our waitress down for refills or anything extra that we needed, as she seemed to always come at perfect timing and to where it didn't feel like we were constantly hounded.  Now on to the food! The food was good. Sounds like a bland description, but...what can I say? It was good. It was your typical Thai place, where with whatever you order you select your spice level from 1 to 10. For only being the first time that I have eaten here, its kind of hard to tell if the food is consistently good or just for that night. Overall, out of all the orders from our group, me being a taste tester of everybody's order, it was all tasty. I will be going back to see if the food is really legit and not only being good on certain nights. Only draw back that I have, is that they don't have fountain drinks! For soda, they charge by the can...i think $1 each. Which sucks because if you get hella spicy food, you will drink more! But this isn't a reason that I wouldn't come back here.   Unfortunately, they close at 9. I don't remember if this is closing every night, but that night it was at 9 pm. Being a karaoke place, and being that I am with a group of a bunch of friends, we wanted to have fun and sing a little. It was after 9 pm, and we nicely asked if we could still sing and our Waitress, with a big smile on her face, says \"Of Course! Have fun!\" The husband came and turned on the whole Shabang! Disco Lights, fog machine, and even dimmed the lights in the restaurant! He showed us how to use the machine and just let us have a blast. Even their kids were having fun recording us acting like fools on their iPads and phones! The husband and wife were watching and clapping for us even as they cleaned up! We only did maybe 4 or 5 songs and then decided we didn't want to hold them up, but they insisted that they wouldn't mind if we stayed longer. They were Super Nice!  So, 4 stars! I will be coming back! Great Food and Great People that own it!",

    "text": "This place is fantastic!! I lived in Vegas almost 10 years before finding this gem. I had been looking for a Thai place with Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) for years, I actually thought I would never get to eat it again without returning to Chicago or Milwaukee. I always order the same thing, chicken Pad Kee Mao, it's sooo addicting! I have to ask them to add baby corn (since this place doesn't already add it, it's a MUST and I'm addicted to those little things). My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Red Curry (minus the bamboo chutes because he thinks they're gross), he thinks it is absolutely delicious. We have tried many of their appetizers over the years. The Thai spring rolls are fresh and the veggies are crisp and the flavor just pops, the mint really makes it. Tonight we had the House appetizers, it's like a sampler. Everything on it was delicious, from the rangoons and wontons to the egg rolls...fried to perfection. This place has a 1-10 spice level on their dishes. My boyfriend sticks to a level 3 and finds it very hot. I love all things hot, so I usually get a level 5 or 6 (spicy and delicious). If you have a craving for jerky, give it a try. I've had spicy and regular beef jerky and thought they were both tasty. If you aren't sure what flavor you want, just ask them and they will let you sample as many flavors as you would like! The restaurant always has extremely friendly staff and Sun is always friendly and asking how we've been with a big smile on her face! I really enjoy Sun's every time I order and I've never had a bad experience. I've been eating here for about a year and a half and I'll continue eating here as long as they are open. If you want good, fresh, inexpensive Thai food and friendly staff, definitely give this place a try!!",

Small mom and pop shop, we were only ones dining there, but we did notice quite a few people picking up to go orders.  We started off with the stuffed fried chicken wings (deboned chicken leaving just the skin and wing tip and filled with ground pork, vermicelli, veggies), and this dish was surprisingly tasty but a tad on the salty side....nothing a few bites of rice can't neutralize.  Honestly, it's not the best Thai ever but the Thai fried rice was comparable to Archi's and the dish was fairly large.  The fried rice was my favorite dish, the rice had the right texture and flavor.  We also ordered the garlic and pepper chicken...which had good flavor but perhaps was slightly overcooked and the portion was rather small.  The service was very attentive and the server always had a smile on her face.  Definitely give it a try if you live in North Las Vegas...well since you really don't have too many other options :)",

    "text": "Sun's Thai Food & Jerky was a wonderful surprise! We stopped in to grab their lunch special, around six dollars for select entrees and it included a drink, a small appetizer (either soup or a spring roll), and steamed rice. They have a karaoke stage open to the public, and the atmosphere is relaxing and simple. The service was really friendly and was happy to answer any questions we had.  My boyfriend ordered red curry, and I ordered the green, each with pork as the meat. The orders came very quickly, and the appetizers were quite good. The spring roll was a little plain, nothing special, but the hot and sour soup was fantastic. The curry that we ordered for the lunch special came in a bowl with a scoop of rice next to it. It didn't look like a lot of food until they were combined, but I could barely finish half of mine, so don't worry about leaving hungry. Their portions are quite generous. As for drinks, the standard Thai tea and Thai coffee were delicious and included in the special.   The only warning I have to give about this place is how spicy their seven was. I can usually handle spicy food pretty well, but they use baked Thai chilies, and they really bite you back. My boyfriend, however, ordered their ten and absolutely loved it, so I suppose it just depends on if you're a weenie or not. Either way, Sun's Thai Food and Jerky was a delicious spur-of-the-moment choice and we will definitely be going back.",

I would definitely order from them again but maybenot the curry, it just wasn't perfect.  The fried wontons were great, and sticky rice was wonderfully sticky. But really I can't wait to butn my mouth off with that jerky again.",

However, I think they have live music on some nights which I bet is entertaining! They charge a $5 delivery fee after a few miles, but it's far beyond reasonable! This is a super cute family owned business, with exceptional Thai food! They're always sweet and accommodating. They give out coupons, and always give back if they make a little mistake (I find businesses don't really do this anymore...) One of my favorite things about this place is also the prices vs portions. I could feed at least 2-4 people with a couple entrees. When I order alone, I ALWAYS have left overs. I'm pretty partial to curry, however, every single thing I've tried has been good! I always order about a spice level 1.5/2. I'm not a huge spicy eater, but I do like it, and I fine it to be the perfect medium between not really spicy, but you can taste the spice enough to really enjoy it but not have the after burn.   Red curry: 10+  Veggie Soup: 9+  Glass Noodle Soup: 10+  Drunken noodles: 10+  Tofu Nuggets: 8+ the ginger sauce was 10+  Pineapple rice: 10+  Thai tea: 8+   I love Sun's and everything about it. :)",

I decided to give Sun's a try after seeing all the positive reviews and I am glad I did. I ordered Pad Thai Chicken with a spicy level of 7 and extra sauce ($9). It was delicious and I was so amazed. The price is good also and you get a big portion of food. The 7 was very spicy tho so if you don't have a high spicy tolerance stick with something 5 and under. I also ordered their hot teriyaki jerky ($5) and it was excellent. My mom loved it and ate most of it. I will be going to Sun's again. The staff was very helpful and friendly with me being a new Thai eater.",

I arrived within the timeframe they set and it was ready and waiting on me. Friendly service and the hostess addressed me by name. The Pad Thai is amazingly flavorful and is a great portion. The spice chart is accurate. The Yelp server goes mild, medium etc versus the numbers. I got mild and it reminds me of a 1-2. I also got spicy rice and it is definitely a crowd pleaser. Reminds me of the fried rice back East without the peas and carrots.",

I didn't mean to but I had hit the wrong button and by the time I figured out how to cancel the order it was to late stating that I may not get a refund if I did. So I thought oh well now I have dinner on the way. Yellow chicken curry is one of my most favorite Thai food dishes. I usually always get a level 3 on the spicy meter and it's always perfect.   Well this curry is so spicy I almost can't eat It! They have a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the hottest, and I ordered a 3! I called to ask and she said that's the kitchens fault and we made sure it was a number 3! I don't know how that could be a number 3! I can only imagine what a number 1 is!   The curry wasn't bad, I just wish I could of enjoyed more of it without my mouth burning after every bite! I also wish the lady I spoke to would of had a solution instead of making excuses. Well lesson learned. I'll still eat it because I'm not gonna waste the money I spent. Just beware, medium is not medium!",

    "text": "We usually go to Pin Kaow for work but found this place that's much closer. My coworkers and I had the lunch specials: Panang curry, red curry, and I had the spicy mint chicken. The waitress gave the typical \"are you guys sure you want a 9/10 in spice level?\" But my coworkers insisted they did (she didn't ask me how spicy I wanted my dish but assumed spicy chicken meant spicy). The lunch specials come with soup or salad. The salad has a sweet mustard dressing and the soup that day was sweet and sour.  The place is pretty cute. It's in a strip mall and has a nice display of dishes on a couple chalkboards on the wall. There's also a small stage with instruments and two TVs that were playing a Beatles DVD and a thai cooking show while we were there. Interesting...  Though the plates are small, there's a ton of food in the lunch specials. I tried a bit of the Panang and it was definitely spicy, which was refreshing. However, my spicy mint chicken was not spicy whatsoever. I'm also used to ground chicken and this dish had chunks of pounded chicken which was good, but not expected. It was also pretty greasy. I had to take half of mine home because there was so much.   Overall this is a good option for lunch. The price is hard to beat at $6.99 and it has more dishes for lunch specials than Pin Kaow. Also a lot less busy and service was fast. Not my favorite Thai place but fine for close to work occasionally.",

As soon as we walked in we noticed the string lights running across the ceiling and the live music on the stage. I'm not sure if the gentleman was the owner along with his wife? sister? female friend??? I'm not sure, but they were both singing karaoke and soon a few other diners were singing as well. It's a cute atmosphere, be prepared to sing if you're into that.   Food was great as well. Tom Yum Soup with veggies was SPICYYY holy goodness, but so delicious. I ordered a bowl expecting it to be small, but it's actually really big. We also ordered chicken satay and mint chicken. I was not a fan of the mint chicken, mainly because I didn't taste any mint. Chicken satay was grilled perfectly, but the peanut sauce was served hot, which i thought made it taste odd. I'll probably return here if I'm in the area.",

I live in northwest Las Vegas and, lets face it, good Asian food is kind of hard to find outside of the main Chinatown area up and down Spring Mountain. Sun's was a great place to  find. The food is consistently delicious and it's reasonably priced. The venue is small but charming and very comfortable. The service is always friendly and spot-on. I find myself here at least once a week now, even if it's just for carry out. Pro-tip: the beef and meatball noodle soup (spicy level 8) is great for when you have a pesky head cold. They have a small stage with some guitars, keyboards and amps, so it looks like there is some live music sometimes but I've never been here that late. Comfy venue. Great Thai food. Cold beer. Live music. All conveniently located at Craig and Decatur.",

You know you've been somewhere a few too many times when you walk in and right away the waitress says \"you want your usual table?\"   I've taken just about everyone I know to this restaurant and everyone loves it!  I'm actually pretty surprised to find bad reviews about this place. It's a little too mom-and-pop for some people, I guess. It's family owned and operated. If you're looking for fancy, look somewhere else. If you're looking for amazing Thai food, look no further!   My favorites are the Thai Beef Salad and the Chicken Panang (coconut curry). And of course the Thai iced tea can't be passed up... just be careful with the spice level. It goes from \"a bit of a kick\" to \"holy shit\" real quick. Stick to the lower levels unless you have a death wish.   Sun is the owner, and yes, she's a bit chatty and her English is hard to understand sometimes. But she's a very sweet older lady who loves what she does. No need to insult her appearance! Did your mothers teach you no manners??",

I'm from Wash DC burbs and haven't found great Thai here but this really was was no good for me. Yellow Curry was watered down with mushy potatoes. Pad Thai had way too many carrots and just wasn't flavorful. Fried rice was just mush, like cement. The yum woonsen was the only saving grace. I grew up with a Thai friend so I think I know what authentic is, but maybe not since so many call this place authentic tasting food. Maybe I'm too American Thai food jaded, I don't know.  I just don't get why so many love this place. It was cute and authentic looking for sure but the food was not good.",

The staff warned me that a 4/5 spice level at most other restaurants was a 9/10 at their restaurant. So to be safe, I ordered a level of 2 on the beef pad Thai. BRUTAL!! It was extremely too hot and no matter how much water I drank it didn't help. Well, the flavor is amazing and I've only had one other pad Thai that could top it. So I went back and ordered a 1 and it was still too hot. The last time I went I ordered a 1 and it didn't have any spice (which I didn't want it with no spice, just slight spice). So take heed, the spice is like no other. My husband got the fried rice and he really enjoyed it. The Thai tea sample was great but the actual cup I ordered was too sweet. The waiter did fix it. Staff is friendly as well. Despite the location (I expected a hole in the wall) it's really nice and clean inside. I would recommend this place.",

I went with something closer to my house and on yelp for reviews which usually works , not this time. I was so disappointed with the Pad Thai it was dry, lacking taste and just simply bland even the color was off and pale. The Tom Yum soup was another disappointment. I ordered it med spicy it was way too spicy, which led me to believe since I ordered 2 different orders in separate spicy levels they messed up and decided to make one just super spicy. The shrimp were grainy which means its old and over cooked. I literally had a couple of bites and it all went in garbage. I was so disappointed I thought since this place was a mom and pop shop it was going to be amazing. I was wrong.. I see everyone's reviews and wonder if I just had a different cook. Next time I will suck it up and make the drive to Archie's and order it where I know it's amazing!!",

    "text": "This is my very first Yelp review, and unfortunately, it is not going to be a positive one.  I apologize in advance for the length. I decided to try Sun's based on it being close to my house and having pretty decent Yelp reviews. I placed an online order through Yelp and was given a delivery time of 1 hour. This was fine with me, given that the order was processed through a third party; however, when the driver arrived, he had only half of my order with him. The driver left what he'd brought with my daughter and returned to the restaurant to get the rest.   I called Sun's to find out  A) what happened to the rest of my order in the first place and B) how quickly I could expect the rest of the food to arrive, since half of my family's dinner was sitting on the counter getting cold. Initially, the person on the other end of the line was apologetic and she told me that the driver would return but he had other stops to make first. When I told her that I was not okay with basically being placed at the end of the line to get food that should have been delivered, she started talking over me and her tone got a bit nasty, telling me that it wasn't right for me to call upset about my order. Admittedly, I was dissatisfied and I was not a sweetheart during this call, but I was not inappropriate or abusive. I am not \"that\" customer. Despite the fact that I SAID my reason for calling was to make sure I got the second half of my order quickly, we had a ridiculously long exchange and the girl on the phone ultimately told me that \"of course\" they would include extra stuff and she \"didn't know what I wanted them to do.\"  I think the extra stuff was supposed to placate me. She actually hung up on me because what I wanted was just the stuff I'd paid for in as timely a manner as possible, and I was insistent about that.  At this point I was livid, so I decided to write this review rather than call her back--I very likely would have been inappropriate if I'd called her back right away. However, after half an hour of waiting for the rest of my food, I did call back and I asked to speak with a manager or owner.  I was told that he was not in. I wanted to be done with Sun's at this point, so I told the girl (same one from the first call) that I did not appreciate being hung up on and that I'd waited so long and was so unhappy with the service that I wanted a refund. She claimed that the hang up was an accident but managed to tell me in the same breath that I could have been \"nice about it.\" It's tough to be nice when the person you're dealing with gets defensive about a mistake and wants to talk over you instead of actually hearing what you're trying to say. While we were talking, the delivery driver finally showed up and I ended up sending him off with both halves of the order. Needless to say, my first experience with Sun's will be my last.   To his credit, the owner's son did call back to apologize and to make sure that the refund was taken care of.",

Being new to the area, we have tried other Thai places and have been very disappointed.  That being said, this place was awesome!  We had the appetizer sampler, chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup with meatballs and sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert.  The sampler came with spring rolls, two types of rangoons, shrimp and veggie tempura.  They were all very good.  I normally do not like rangoons but I was fighting my hubby for these.  My husband loved his pad thai.  He got the spice level 7 and said it was perfect.  My soup was very good.  The sweet sticky rice made my eyes roll back in my head.  The service was prompt and very friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  The prices were very good.  (pad thai was 8.95 and soup was 9.95) we didn't finish them because the portions were huge so definitely worth the money.  We are so pleased we stumbled across this little gem.  We will definitely be back for more!",

I ordered the pad see ew (spicy), crab rangoons and fried tofu for my husband. We can tolerate heat so I asked for it to be spicy, as in my experience whenever we order Thai food the heat seems to be lacking. Not in this case! The pad see ew was seasoned nicely, spicy like we wanted with generous portions of beef spread across it. The crab rangoons were alright, they weren't anything special. The way they make theirs is they just fold the wonton wrapper triangularly in half and put filling in the middle, making the first bite mostly wonton wrapper. It's not a big deal but my husband did say something about it. The fried tofu came with a yummy chili dipping sauce that also came with the crab rangoons. The delivery didn't take long, I was given an estimate of 40-55 minutes but it got here in maybe half an hour. The prices for the portions they give you are also very generous and always appreciated! Overall a very good meal and will be ordering more often from this place for sure!",

My daughter and I are big on Thai food..we ordered Pad Si Ew, Green Curry, Beef Jerky, and Spicy Chicken fried rice. EVERYTHING was excellent with a good size serving portion! The beef jerky is BOMB! The texture was awsome..crunchy, tender, and tasty all in one bite! Never even thought of trying Thai beef jerky before but that was excellent! The service was great, everyone was very pleasant. The Restaurant was CLEAN which is a big plus! Oh and yes spicy 10 means spicy 10!!!! Also it looks like they may have a live band because they have a little live band set up for after hours. This is a NLV must try! You will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!",

I went to Dinner with my husband and 4 kids. ( they are 9 and under)  What DISTURBED me was that I was charged $18 tip for a bill of $58!!! That was outrageous!  My youngest child is 3....I have never had gratuity added like that for a bill anywhere!  Service was good, but not 30% tip Amazing!!  I don't skimp on tips, we usually leave 15-20%. For this reason Alone, we will not return for dine in. EVER.  So I get  response that its 18% tip for a party of 6 or more....... Lets do the math on that one   $60 bill ( Includes Tax) x 18% = 10.80 So why was my GRAND TOTAL $78??   Yea  I am hilarious....so funny that you lost my business.",

She then said it would be $3 more. I said it wasn't my fault they had run out of the small. She replied that it wasn't her fault either and I should call Grubhub to cancel the order. Then she hung up on me. I've ordered here several times and would have continued to order here if the manager had not been so rude and petty. $3 to hold on to a repeat customer seems like a bargain to me. Good news is I ended up ordering from \"AMAZING THAI\" the delivery was prompt & courteous. The food was much better than this dump. Sun's loss is mine and AMAZING THAI's gain.",

The only reason I dropped it down a star is because although they didnt have any live music going, they still had the \"night life\" lights going (colored disco ball type lights spinning around).

On the packaging it also had info of the restaurant and went 2 days later. We ordered the papaya salad  (3/5..only because the lady did not tell us ordering a spicy level 3 WITH FRESH RED CHILI PEPPERS would be an Inferno in our mouths but still good) the bbq grilled pork (4/5) it was tender and juicy and full of flavor we also got the lunch special chicken thai fried rice (5/5) so damn good!  We'll definitely be going back for jerky and food!",

I'm probably one of the biggest Thai food snobs you'll ever meet, but this place blew my North Las Vegas expectations out of the water. We ordered the Pad Se Ew (OMG delish) and the combo Thai fried rice (delish x2) for take-out. We don't live close to this place, but by the time my husband got home with it, it was still warm! Like don't need the microwave warm. Like, I'm a picky pregnant woman with cravings who'd go nuts if I had to warm something up in the micro, LOL. Will order again! Thanks so much for the customer service as well.",

Today I ordered my food (red curry & pad Thai) my curry has the worst taste ever didn't even taste like curry, the pad Thai noodles were mostly all burnt the little bit that wasn't that I tasted didn't even have any flavor. When I took the food back they said they forgot to but ingredients in the curry, my friend had told me her last time ordering from there the food wasn't good either. It breaks my heart but I won't be going back there.",

Best beef jerky I have had to this day, Thai Spicy #10 delicious. I was at the Summerlin Farmers Market and on my way out saw the booth and thought I would give it a shot and I fell in love! I continuously recommend this place to everyone I know. I am a bit new to this reviewing thing so usually no idea what to say. It is fantastic though so feel free to ask questions and I will always answer them honestly.",

We had the lunch special of spicy chicken basil. I was a little disappointed when it arrived and the chicken wasn't ground. The flavor was awesome. Next time I will get the regular size spicy chicken basil, sounds like that one comes with ground chicken, which I prefer. Chicken Satay was probably the best I've ever had. Beef salad was also pretty good. Thai tea was delicious. Large was served in a large beer type mug over ice. $3.50. Well worth it to me. We'll be back soon!!!",

My girlfriend and I have eaten at many Thai restaurants in Vegas from Archi's to Thai Food To Go to Pin Kaow and while those restaurants may have good dishes, Sun's Thai Food & Jerky may be the best. You can order your food with the typical spicy levels 1-10 or do it yourself (The best way to go, of course!). They don't mess around here with their crushed chili peppers either. I took one whiff of it in the metal container and I thought my sinuses exploded! A 5/6 here is like a 10 at the other restaurants mentioned above.  Started off one meal with their Crab Rangoons (Delicious!), Pad Thai for myself (Fantastic!), and Panang (Amazing!) for the girlfriend. Top that off with great customer service and they have something really great growing here.",

    "text": "Very happy with our last minute stop at Sun's.  We were driving down Craig Rd. trying to figure out what to eat.  Newly Vegan, our choices are often limited.  We were picking up something to go and after seeing the menu and speaking to a very nice woman (daughter of the owner I believe) she assured me they could make the dish with no animal stock, egg or milk.  We were very pleased with the flexibility and sincerity she showed and though I thought to give 4 stars which is \"Yay I'm a fan\" I went with the 5 because her service to us really showed that they could work with our food limitations!   We added extra vegetables once we got home to our pineapple fried rice & masaman curry (namely cauliflower & bamboo shoots) but the flavor was PERFECT and that is the main point of anything.   We were very happy with the flavor & will definitely return!  Thank you so much.",

Yes, the service was friendly and quick, but the place felt dirty and the food was really bad.  My shrimp pad see ew was very bland and had exactly 5 dirty-tasting shrimp in it and my husband's curry was a big bowl of super liquidy sauce with some very rubbery chicken and peanuts floating in it.  The crab rangoons we ordered as an appetizer were some of the worst I've ever had.  It makes me sad giving them a 1-star rating.  I really do wish the best for mom-n-pop places like this.... especially when they are friendly.  But I have to be honest.    I should have known when we were the only people eating there at 6:30 on a Friday night!",

Very authentic Thai food, probably the best Thai food in Vegas for locals and cheap! For those used to American Thai food, this place does Thai spicy, I will normally order an 8 at other Thai places and get a 6 here. The portions are awesome I get two meals out of mine...delivery and dine in is excellent, cute hole in the wall that's 3 mins from my house! Favorite dishes: Spicy Eggplant, spicy mint, green curry, and their beef jerky appetizer! Delicious!!",

The Thai ice tea was some of the best I've ever had and they are served in large mugs, a bit heavy on the ice for my liking but worth the price tag.   We got the yellow curry level 4, and whoa was that just a touch outside of my comfort level, but I fought through it and it still had a fantastic flavor, sweet, spicy, and well balanced with a decent amount of chicken.   The sticky mango coconut was NUTS! I LOVED it. They don't give enough mango for the amount of rice, it was half a mango to about 1.5 cups of rice but the flavor and the sweetness was sooooooo good. I would order it to go when I have the craving.   We also got an appetizer of the house appetizer to try a little of every thing and that was as filling as an entree! The food and service here is fantastic!",

Upon entering we had to wait about five minutes to be seated due to phone orders and servers bringing food out to this large table that had no guests . Dishes kept coming out one by one for that table and their food just sat their looking pretty but getting cold .  When a waitress finally came to us she offered options of drinks and I opted for the Thai tea which not only was too sweet but upon getting the check I realized she gave me the large for $3.50 without asking me when I could never finish that size so that is a pet peeve of mine .   Now let's get to the food .. they don't offer spice levels if they do I wasn't asked and this was the first pad Thai I've ever had that was also too sweet no spice hardly at all and maybe she assumed we didn't like spicy because we weren't offered a sauce tray either so I was baffled ... first up tho came our salad and soup I ordered two lunch specials pad Thai and Thai fried rice and my mom got a pepper chicken and egg rolls .  The  Thai egg rolls were good , my soup was good , salad was okay and my fried rice was really good but not the freshest tomatoes with it .  Issue was all our food came out except my moms chicken and when we finally were overheard upset about it two different people came by and one went back and told them to start making it when we would of just cancelled it because can you imagine you're at lunch and you don't feel right eating cause your mom has no food plus like I said my paid Thai was combination I had hardly any shrimp and the meat had no flavor plus I wasn't even offered sauce until I got upset and had them give us the stuff to go than I got it but barely any apologies and nothing was done but I won't be going back and it sucks cause it's close by and the jerky is good and I like the ambiance but this was a fail",

My favorite was Fried Tofu, the tofu was light and not greasy and the sweet and sour dipping sauce was good. The Panama Curry was alright, my only complaint was the beef was a little too thick, a thinner slice would have been better. We also ordered the beef noodle soup, chicken satay, Crying Tiger Beef and finished up the dinner  an order of the mango sticky rice for dessert. All those were okay nothing really special.   Food alone for this restaurant  isn't good enough to be a 4 star restaurant. The best part about the restaurant was the karaoke. My family enjoyed the karaoke very much we ate and we sang. It was very fun for the whole family.  There was great energy in the restaurant and the karaoke MC did a good job engaging everyone. Karaoke is only available from Thursday to Saturday. Overall the service was good, the staff was friendly and worked well together to ensure we had a good experience.  Another thing great about this place is that it's very wallet friendly. Also they were very generous with serving portion.",

How cool is that. I am a Thai food fan, so you can say I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes too anything Thai. Anywho, I have Sun's four stars..the only reason it wasn't a five is because of how tiny this place is. The atmosphere is very soft and chill vibe. They have a stage, not sure when they have entertainment but during the meantime they play classical/smooth jazz. Which I find very inviting! The greet and service is quick and easy. They are always nice and check in with you frequently. I always order pad Thai/fried rice beef jerky and spring rolls. If you haven't had the jerky...I say go for it! It's amazing. All the flavors and spicy levels are on point to anything you order. This spot is fairly private so if your looking for a place to sit and work or possibly a nice affordable date this is the place!",

Now that I have a different schedule, it's been on my to eat list.   The fiance and I both got thai ice tea to drink. It was ideal sweetness for me and very creamy. I definitely liked their balance here.   Massuman curry with tofu was good. There were a lot of small tofu pieces, potato, carrot, onions and peanuts in it and a good amount of curry sauce. It's more watery of a curry which I prefer because I don't like when places use thickeners and seem to have a pasty curry that is indicative of using premade store bought bases. The flavor was really nice though, balanced and had a nice creaminess.  The only downside was the potato was a bit undercooked. It came with 1 scoop of rice which is not enough so you may need to order more like I did to sop up the curry.   Pad kee mao with pork was awesome. I love drunken noodles and this was a really good version of this. Good flavor, the noodles were soft and cooked well, pork was pretty tender.   Of course the spices here are on the \"Thai spicy\" level which kinda makes me happy. I love spicy, but to me places that do not water down their cooking values tend to cook the way they would for themselves, the way it should be. We ordered a \"3\" which normally is not spicy at all at most places, just a bit of pepper flakes for flavor. Here it was spicy enough for the fiance to be at his spicy threshold which is a 5 at most places. I still added flakes and vinegared chili because I like my Thai pretty hot.   Service was pretty friendly from Ms. Sun and her husband. It's definitely family owned and run which is the type of places I like finding and supporting.   I'm definitely gonna be back for more, but this was a pretty positive first visit.,",

The place is not the biggest but they have a karaoke stage(more on that later) and they also sell their own jerky! I have been to Sun's at least 4 times and the food is always hot and tastes good. I have had the red curry, yellow curry, masaman and phad thai. They let you choose your spice level. You can choose the meat: chicken, beef, pork, or for little more some seafood options. Soda comes in a can that you open and then pour into the glass with ice. For the food to price I can say this, I never leave hungry.   The service is good but I can say that most people seem come to get their orders to go. The karaoke is just awesome. Just ask and they will start it up. They have a fog machine and disco lights and there are real instruments up on stage which make me feel like a rock star! The owners and staff are friendly.  The only downside to Sun's is I can easily imagine as people get to know it will become packed for that karaoke. For now I enjoy belching out lyrics to my friends and the owners!",

The sweet chilli sauce was spectacular, the sweet owner suggested I try a level 2 because a 5 would be too hot for me. (I'm more comfortable lying to thai women about my heat level tolerance), I accepted, but refused the glass of water to keep my pride intact. I truly wish you'd come and try this restaurant. I realize that my other reviews don't make me a food critic, but this place is up there with Poke Express in quality and overall experience. The Thai fried rice was out of this world, their Thai beer sealed the deal for me. If you're out for a sports night, come here first then go to your bar. Excellent service, I am not sure, but it might be a family run restaurant, everyone is very nice and the food is made to order delicious. Mayor, if you're reading this post, you gotta drive up here for the Spicy Catfish.",

My parents know the owner of the restaurant, but we live pretty far away so we don't normally get a chance to visit here often. But the two nights I've had my meal here were spectacular. Coming from a Thai family, we really do know what places are a hit and what places are a miss when it comes to Thai food, and this place sure is a hit. The family come from the northern region of Thailand so definitely try their Isan food!  As most reviewers have mentioned, their spice is actually a lot hotter than most restaurants so whatever you're normally comfortable with at most restaurants, take it 2 or 3 numbers down because my 6 Tom Yum tasted like an 8. Some foods I would definitely recommend would be Nam Tok (waterfall beef) which was seasoned perfectly, Tom Yum which had huge flavor and you can tell they use natural herbs and aromatic to get that big taste, and my favorite by far is their BBQ Pork (which is a bit misleading because it's actually translated to grilled pork in Thai since BBQ Pork is normally known as Char Siu here in the States.) This restaurant truly does pride itself in serving authentic Thai food (I can say this because the owner kept asking my parents if it tastes just like food from the motherland.)  All in all this place is great for authentic Thai food with big flavor. If you are in the North Las Vegas area and you want some Thai food, I highly recommend this place!",

Holy shit, it was crazy spicy. But delicious!  We had -   Panang Chicken Curry - Good, just wish it had a little more something to it.  BBQ Pork - Delicious.  Pad Thai - Very good. Tum Yum Krung Soup - Delicious with awesome flavor. This is supposed to come with shrimp, but it was chicken.   They delivered within an hour and the delivery man was very friendly.

You can get it at both the swap meet and at their restaurant.  The flavor is ridiculously addicting...the sweet and spicy combo of the \"Hot\" flavors and the \"Thai\" flavors (my two favorites) hand you the biggest challenge in trying not to tear through the entire bag in 10 minutes.   I think the beef is made from high quality cuts as it's dry but still extremely tender and there's no fat or cheap marbeling or strains like you'd find in a store bought Oberto bag...Sun's Jerky is an entirely different experience.  I recently tried the spicy pork strips and their new Hawaiian and came across 2 new favorites.   If you haven't checked them out yet, you're definitely missing out on something special. It's a snack better than anything else and also probably better for you too, straight up protein, no fat and some wickedly tasteful flavors.   Mouth is starting to water...Must. Grab. Some. Thai. Flavor. Now.",

    "text": "Feeling under the weather, there are only two foods that can perk up my spirits when I'm battling/recovering from a cold: curry or sundubu (tofu soup). Craving for some panang, I remembered I added Sun's Thai to my mile long list of bookmarks, and I thought today might be the perfect time to try their food.  Quick note: I didn't visit this restaurant in person. My awesome father was the one who picked up my food. He did mention how the service was quick and the order was ready in under 10 minutes. With that being said, onto the food portion of my review.  For $5.99 I received a small carton of white rice, an egg roll, and my panang. The egg roll was OK. Just an ordinary deep fried egg roll that contained the common minced veggies and rice noodles. Rather than choosing either beef or chicken for my panang (spicy level 5), I opted for tofu. Upon opening the container, I got a whiff of the strong aroma of basil and lime (that awoke my senses!). The curry's consistency was watery and wasn't as thick as other panangs I've eaten; however, the rich flavor was undeniable. Unlike Komol's or Archi's panangs, red and green peppers were absent, as were chili peppers; although, there was a subtle spiciness present. But the absence of those ingredients left me desiring for more substance than the curry and tofu alone.   Sun's Thai receives a solid 3-Stars from me. The lunch special price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, though it might not be enough to remain satiated well until dinnertime.",

Seriously?! I'm paying for it, therefore I should be able to make substitutions and get what I want. I also ask myself why I continue to patronize this place when they don't care to keep my business.   They charge extra for things that should already come with your food and they don't care one bit if you order from them frequently. I own a business myself and although I have overhead costs, I always take care of my loyal, repeat customers. Your customers want to feel like you care about them and appreciate their business. The owner doesn't comprehend how the business and customer relationship works.   There's a lot of competition in this town, so you'd think they'd try harder to make their customers feel like they care. They don't! These people don't go out of their way to earn your business. They could care less if you're a loyal, consistent customer.   The thing is, with the \"we don't care if you order here or not\" kind of attitude, restaurants don't last long. The food is pretty good but portions are very small for the prices. I'm primarily reviewing in regards to their service and attitude BUT let's me make this clear Sun's Thai..... I don't care how good the food is, if you disrespect me you lose my business. PERIOD. BYE!!",

Anyways.. we ordered panang curry, eggplant, and phad Thai. Overall, very satisfied with our meal. The panang curry had a nice flavor with just enough spice. The phad Thai had that sweet, nutty flavor and the noodles had the right amount of chew. I liked the soy sauce and basil flavor of the eggplant and appreciated that we had a choice between fresh tofu and fried tofu.   Service was friendly and the prices are fair.",

I got there around 12:10 to find out my food was not ready. It was obvious that the server either forgot to put the order in or the chef didn't make it or made a mistake on my order.. I should've known since she even forgot to ask my name for the order. They just left me hanging and never told me why it's taking so long. I wanted to just cancel if the food wasn't ready yet because I was in a rush but they didn't even let me talk. They just kept on saying \"it's coming I'm sorry\". It is now 12:30 and I finally got my food but I am now running late in schedule which makes me so upset because now I don't even have time to eat. I hope it at least taste good when I do get to eat them later cold..  Update review on the food: They forgot to add any spice to it even though I asked for spice level 3. They had so much onions and veggies compared to the meat. The meat (both chicken and the beef) were dry. Not to mention the sauce from the boxes were everywhere by the time I got to my meal because of the poor packaging. It was definitely not worth an hour wait.",

And don't even think about pick up if you want to eat today. You won't be greeted, asked your name or spoken to unless you initiate conversatIon. Twice I've ordered take out and it took 30+ mins to be ready, and there's only 2-3 tables in the restaurant eating. Very bad set up",

They offer sit down service and on the weekends be ready to enjoy the tunes of the live karaoke stage!   The ambiance is great and fun; the food, the food is delicious!   The have a beef noodle soup that I would compare to pho. It's DELICIOUS! Not only are the noodles delicious but people, this broth is amazing!    The green curry comes at a base of 5 in spice. Add a little extra, shall I say a 7, I'm telling you- it's sooooo good! 5 stars for the green curry alone!  Thai fried rice, yes please- and the pineapple fried rice is even better.   The only thing I have had that I wasn't impressed with was the crab Rangoon.   If you're in the area, I would highly suggest!",

I ended up throwing all away because it was just not worth it.  The crab rangoon came burnt and tasted overly fishy.  The Pad See Ew was okay - I've definitely had better - but the chicken was dry and overcooked.  But what was really just gross was the Panang curry.  The sauce was too thick - for my preference.  The beef was kinda unidentifiable.  I aways get nervous when beef is gray colored.  And, again, the sauce was kind of fishy and feet tasting.  I had like 5 bites and chucked the rest.  So sad because it had good reviews and I really wanted to like it.  Will go back to ordering from my regular Thai places.",

If you like onions, I would still suggest getting it without onions. The first time I ordered this without specifying \"no onions\", they literally put half of an entire onion in it. -Papaya salad is good. Order the \"regular\" and see how you handle that spiciness.

Sun Thai is way above them all in the food, the freshness, the price, the quaint romantic atmosphere, and the beer and Thai tea.  Pamh is a delightful and sweet Vietnamese waitress and she always knows I will order the hot sour soup which. I crave!  We have tried many of the local casinos' buffets at which I ALWAYS have a bowl of hot sour soup because I love it.  But Sun Thai's version is the best I've tasted here in Las or ANY other place in the USA I've tried it. Their green curry chicken is great and their shrimp pineapple rice is great too.  I tried their chicken with basil and mint with veggies yesterday and it was really good! Their karaoke is on weekends.  Their lunch menu is the best value but it's all a good value.  I was not crazy about the beef jerkey.   I've seen only a couple of bad reviews on this place and it's never about the food.  If you have a service dog, alert the owner when you get to the front.  It's only polite.  Also, make sure you tell them how spicy you want your food.  I have forgotten to tip once here and I was not chased to my car. That review is just twisted. I am not a friend of this family.  I am not an employee and nobody paid me to review this.  I care about YOU.  And I want you to know how great this place is. You will.thank me!",

    "text": "Me and my wife found Sun's Thai Food just a couple of months ago. This place is amazing! They have the best Thai food in Las Vegas, hands down. And I mean every dish! I personally LOVE the Panang Curry. It's family owned and operated and has a very warm, inviting feel. We've been literally eating there twice a week since we found it! The prices are great. Saturday night karaoke is a blast, too! Very laid back and introvert-friendly. One tip before ordering: be sure to order your food between a spicy level 1 and 3 if you are used to ordering at a 5 and 6 (like us) other places. They use very high quality spices and the scale runs much hotter than normal!",

    "text": "This awesome place inspired me to stop being lazy and finally open up my Yelp account.       I have changed my diet to a whole food plant based diet, therefore, shopping and cooking organic/ farmers market veggies/NON-GMO Frankenfood  is time consuming, plus exercising efficiently, working a full-time job, getting PROPER rest, and having some fun times with the Gurlyfriend to counter the stress and enjoy life...Is what I'm seeking but like Pimpin', It ain't easy.  When we fall short on time which like many others out there we skimp on time to eat properly resulting in zooming thru the Drive-thru of any of your fast-food chain and basically putting high fat/calorie/sugar/sodium/poison dead food with zero vitamins or nutrients in our body's.  We like to get this as take-out to have this around the house when we don't have the time to prepare and cook healthy meals (which is often these days).          We have been eating there 4 to 5 days a week, considering I get 2 sometimes 3 portions from 1 order (8$-10$)  I have also changed my portion sizes away from your typical Western Diet mentality.  We have been eating there about a week after they opened, since I live close and drive by it almost everyday...do the math on that.  We eat there a lot.  They know us now obviously, since my GF is Thai and is also fluent in Thai, she enjoys speaking with them.  They all are extremely friendly and polite.  What I really respected was that I asked the chef if it was possible to not use oil in my order of just a veggie stir-fry ($5-$6).    He sure didn't use the oil, no debate at all and It was absolutely delicious.  I also do not want to put MSG in my body, so we asked if they use any products containing it and they told us \"No\"        Food I have ate there:                 Veggie stir-fry, All their veggies are fresh, cut well, and flavorful.  They cook them perfectly also.               Green Thai Curry veggies only, spicy #10 (spice scale 0-10) I have had various degrees of spice levels, all are yummy and to your taste.  This is my personal favorite.  Veggies are red bell pepper, bamboo shoots, carrots, bok choy, broccoli, mushrooms...I might be missing 1 or 2 more.  I crave this stuff.              Red Curry veggies only----super yummy              Yellow Curry veggies only------yummy              Pad Thai with chicken-------super yummy, GF's favorite              Pad Thai veggie only-----super yummy  If you want lime with your Pad Thai, just ask them...it does not come with it              Papaya Salad----yummy              Veggie Egg Rolls-----super yummy, fresh, some of the best I've had               The place is very clean and has a good energy about it.  They have Karaoke, but unfortunately we don't sit and eat due to busy lives, so take-out it is.  The food is also consistently good, never a \"bad\" visit.  The prices are good for the generous portion size and quality ingredients.  One of the reasons their veggies taste good is the quality of them.  But, quality ingredients cost more also.  They also are a small business and have to make a living too...so yeah, prices are good.  Although I don't normally incorporate animal protein in my diet anymore, I did try a piece of the Beef and Chicken in which the quality and cooking time was spot on.  Flavor was great.  I have not yet had a chance to try any jerky yet but I have heard from others that it is good which doesn't  surprise me.   I shared the Green Curry with a fellow co-worker and he is also a huge fan now.  I made myself hungry half way through this review, so I ate some left over Green Curry w/ veggies over some of their traditional Thai jasmine rice while I finished this.  -Davey",

    "text": "I was just talking with my step-mom yesterday about how hard it is to find a decent Thai place these days, and how everywhere we used to go has seriously fallen short in the quality department. I then remembered today about a Thai place that opened fairly recently down the street from my house and figured I'd give it a try.  I got to Sun's Thai Food about 45 minutes before closing, and was immediately greeted with a big friendly smile from one of the owners. I decided to order to-go, and she handed me a menu to peruse. Once I was ready, she had the waitress (her daughter-in-law) come up front to take my order. She was also extremely friendly and told me the wait would be about 15-20 minutes.  I actually ended up waiting about 35 minutes...which really wasn't a big deal to me, I wasn't in a rush. During that time they never forgot about me. They acknowledged me with a smile every time they walked behind the front counter and apologized for the wait, assuring me it would be ready soon. And when it finally was, they handed me my to-go bag, thanked me for coming in, and wished me a pleasant evening. The customer service alone would have made me give this place another shot, even if the food was sub-par.  While I was waiting, I had overheard a group that was dining in exclaim \"Oh my gosh, this Tom Yum soup is incredible! Everything is so good!\" So I was very excited to get home and eat. Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  Tom Yum Soup w/ Tofu - It was, indeed, INCREDIBLE! I always get nervous when I order Tom Yum with tofu because, for whatever reason, a lot of other Thai places seem to have a different recipe for the tofu version than their regular Tom Yum Kai. But this was exactly what I was looking for - hot and spicy lemongrass soup with white onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, scallions, and all of the wonderful spices that make this soup what it is...but with tofu instead of chicken. The scent of lemongrass hit me as soon as I lifted the lid and I was immediately sold. It was so fresh and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it. I hardly left myself any room to enjoy the rest of the food I ordered. I highly recommend it. And I'm willing to bet that both the Tom Yum Kai and Tom Yum Koong are just as good.  Fried Wontons (?) - I ordered the Crab Rangoons, but I'm pretty sure it's not what I got. I think I may have actually been given the fried wontons, because the inside definitely didn't have any cream cheese and tasted like pork. I was only slightly disappointed since I was really craving cream cheese filling, but despite this...they were still pretty good. They were not at all greasy or soggy. They had a nice crisp texture and I was pleasantly surprised that their sweet and sour sauce was slightly spicy. (But not overwhelmingly so. It had the sweet and sour flavor, with a bit of heat in the aftertaste. Excellent.)  Pad Thai w/ Tofu - As soon as I opened the box, I thought \"Whoa.\" This was the sauciest Pad Thai I've ever seen. (And in my mind, that's not a bad thing.) I usually have to ask for some extra sauce at other places because the noodles tend to be dry, but that was not a problem here. That sauce had great flavor and the tofu was cooked perfectly, fried and slightly crunchy on the outside. I'm not sure if the waitress heard me say my spice level on this one, because it ended up being very mild. However, they did provide a couple containers of chili paste which easily rectified that. The box did not contain any lime or cilantro, which I may ask for next time to see how those flavors compliment the extra amount of sauce.  They threw in a side of rice, which I didn't order. So that's pretty cool. (It'd be more so if I actually liked rice to begin with.) They also provided plastic ware w/ napkins, soy sauce, and the aforementioned chili paste...so I had pretty much everything I needed to consume my dinner without ever popping into the kitchen.  Overall, I'm extremely impressed. And I will definitely be bringing my family by to give it another go. (My step-mom especially!)",

The flavor was good he had a heat level of 3 and it was spicy for him but he has a low tolerance. Mine was good I requested a heat level of 9 but she would not serve me a 9 because she insisted they had very spicy food. I insisted I could handle it(I have a very high tolerance and love hot food)but she said since this is my first time she would only give me a 5 and extra peppers on the side. This was my only negative about this place please give me what I ask for. Needless to say I ended up putting tons of peppers on my food. She asked me if it was hot and I told her not enough for me I b had to add to it so she said next time I come in they would give me a 9 or 10. Fast service, cute inside looks like they have live music too but not on the night we were there. If I'm back in this area I would definitely eat here again.",

Thought they were a little high for the quantity of food and location of the restaurant.  Also, was extremely disappointed that the soups, especially the Tom Kha Kai, didn't come in a size small enough to enjoy before the entree.  So no soup this night!  The Pad Thai was ok, but it was not served with a lime or any cilantro, which I love in Pad Thai.  We also had a pork and vegetable dish, which was kind of bland.  All in all it was just ok",

I am addicted to Thai food and unfortunately have had to drive across town for my fix for years and years due to the lack of good and authentic restaurants (none) in the North Las Vegas area.  Thank god this place has opened up! I was really hesitant due to the shopping center / lot but I'm so glad I didn't let the location deter me. I ordered the yellow curry with veggies and tofu, chicken pad see ew, and combination fried rice. Absolutely delicious and extremely fresh! The staff was so friendly as well and the restaurant was very clean and very nice. My only warning is that the food is very spicy - I usually order level 5 at my other favorite spots but here I will probably have to go with a 3. Over all, this place is awesome! They will be seeing me a lot! :)",

    "text": "Such a HUGE disappointment. I seen this place have an opening soon sign up a couple years ago. I was so excited for it. But, before they opened. We relocated to Henderson. And never thought of it again. Until now. We ordered take out from here since we were on this side of town. We placed the order online which was convenient, to view the menu and order. I read the reviews before hand and got a feel of what's good. After reading, I decided I'll go with the Pad Thai. My husband likes to stick with typical entrees. It's either orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken/beef. They had the option for sweet and sour chicken, Thai style. I told him how it'll be different from what he's used it. He agreed to get it but just wanted to make it wasn't spicy. Double made sure I didn't order it spicy. We also order the chicken satay with peanut sauce.   It took us longer than expected to arrive there. I think we got there 20 mins passed our expected pick up time. It was stormy out and it delayed driving time. We got to where we were going. Which was up the street to eat our food.   The only thing good was the chicken satay and the rice that came with the sweet and sour chicken.   The pad Thai was gross. I don't know if it was the oil the cook it in or just the seasoning. It was honestly the worst pad Thai I ever had. I even made it myself once, and I screwed it up. Plus, the noodles all stuck together. Like when you leave your pasta sitting in the strainer too long. That may be due to is arriving late. But I don't think too much of it was. It looked like it was just thrown in the pot and then top with everything to heat up.   The sweet and sour chicken was a mess. They wrapped in a bag and all the liquid went into the bag. Which I guess is better than it going over everything else. My husband didn't eat much of it. I didn't think of anything till he said I could have it tomorrow. And he just ate the rice and chicken satay. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't like it and that it was really spicy.  I told him I ordered it not spicy and maybe it's just a kick to the dish and that'll I'll save it for later. I tried it. Not only was it too spicy. The chicken was bad. You could totally taste that the chicken had expired already. I almost threw up. My stomach is more sensitive to his. I can handle spicy food. I ordered my pad Thai spicy. But the chicken...bad. I've cooked bad chicken before and it was the same. When you smelled the dish, you can smell the spoilage of it. Just covered in spice. My husbands stomach didn't feel well the rest of the night. It makes me wonder if anything else was good.  I was excited for this place. I always bought Sun's beef jerky at Sam's Fantastic Swamp Meet for as long as I could remember. I don't know if this was just a bad day for them. Maybe they didn't check their product. Maybe the cook was tired. The reviews seemed trustworthy. I don't know. I just know I'm bummed as hell.   I really thought this was going to be a five star.",

Something I'm highly allergic to. When I called to see if they would fix it the young lady on the phone instead gave me attitude and was rude as hell.  I took the food back and they did remake it but I had to sit there while she belittled me about not telling her no onions. Foods good but this customer service experience will probably keep me away from here. Good food just not worth the attitude. Thanks but no thanks",

The server helped us to make a choice btw, even though in many places if you asked \"what's good?\", you would get the inevitable \"everything \". She said pineapple fried rice is children's favorite because of pineapples, raisins and cashews, its sweet. She explained the difference between several curries that they had on the menu. Also for most of dishes you can choose your meat - beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, combo or seafood combo.   We'll be coming here again",

Sun herself is there at the counter, day or night, offering samples of thai jerky and anything else on the menu- what that includes, exactly, I'll never really know, since I only get the jerky. They do have cute chalkboard menus suggesting chef specials and customer favorites, but I still come for the jerky..  The regular beef teriyaki is my jam, though I sometimes snag a bag of the hot for my guy- all of their hot flavors are generally pretty mild. They also have buffalo and salmon jerky, the latter of which I'd never heard of and don't really care for, despite loving salmon in all of it's other forms.  TLDR: Come for the jerky, stay for the karaoke?",

I also ordered dessert of mango and coconut sticky rice and the rice was super mushy.  This last order was last night and it was a simple beef pad thai, mild.  Omgoodness, I don't think these people know what mild is.  I spent about 10 minutes picking out pepper seeds because it was that spicy!  My lips and mouth was on fire!  and of course I didn't get all the seeds so I did ingest some.  The pad thai had no other real favor besides the heat.  I'm not sure if others who have raved about this place have tasted what authentic Thai is about, sure there's heat but seriously there has to be favor underneath that heat.",

I ordered the beef and broccoli for myself. I feel that in vegas, I should just stop ordering it. Beef is just weird everywhere, and here was no different. My roommate ordered the red curry with chicken. It was delicious and I ate a bunch of it lol. I would probably eat here again, just no beef entrees. I tried suns jerky at the flea market. She was a very sweet and friendly lady. And her jerky is just delicious!",

I highly recommend going there for food. the jerky that she makes is really good as well. :)",

The Tom kah Kai soup was loaded with good-sized chicken pieces, and lots of mushrooms. The \"3\" spicy level of papaya salad was too much for me, so beware! I don't consider myself a lightweight on spices, but I guess I'm not ready for Thai-style levels yet.",

    "text": "I'm familiar with Thai cuisine because I grew up with Thai and Laotian friends.  True authentic Thai restaurants in Las Vegas are unfortunately scarce in this city.  I usually only try new Thai restaurants based on word of mouth but I was meeting up with a friend so we decided on a place nearby.  I went to this restaurant based on the good reviews on Yelp.  As I was waiting for my friend to show up I ordered the traditional favorite Thai Beef Jerky.  I looked at my plate when the waitress brought it out and notice that the majority of the jerky was cut almost as thin as mini straws.  And at first glanced I could tell that the jerky was fried to the point where it was dried out and hardened.  I mentioned this to the waitress and her attitude was \"next time tell me not to fry it too much\".  I didn't like her attitude so I told her I found this place on Yelp then her attitude change.  She didn't offer to change out the jerky but she was more attentive after that.  The jerky was definitely flavorful and would have been perfect minus the cost effective size and dehydrated brittle state.  I sucked it up and my friend and I tried to finish the $7.95 appetizer.  We ordered the Drunken Noodles(which was not on the menu).  I thought that was a plus.  The flavor was authentic and perfect with some minor tough rice noodles that I encountered.  Their red curry flavor was right on but the chicken I could tell was a bit dry.  Their Papaya Salad flavor was perfect with the exception of the equal amount of carrots to papaya portions.    It's a simple little restaurant with a definite mom and pop feel to it.  Overall I enjoyed their authentic flavors. And would have given them four stars if they had stayed more True to quality on a few of their dishes.  But being it's location on the Northwest side of town I would have to say I consider this 100% Thai as you're going to get.",

They were both excellent and the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was delicious! I ordered the Green Curry Shrimp at a level 1 (I'm a wuss but I'm trying), it was perfect, I could eat it without a problem. My fiance, he's a heat nut, ordered the Drunken Noodle at a 10. Everywhere else he orders it at a 10 and it's no problem, here he couldn't finish it! He loved it, no where else compares to here bar none! We will definitely be coming back for more!",

    "text": "This place is despicable! They don't deserve any stars. In fact their stars should be in default! I ordered delivery from here a few days ago and it took over two hours for it to be delivered. I live a little over a mile away from this place, there is no excuse for the service to take that long. When the boy came to the door, he explained that they only had half the order ready. That's right. HALF THE ORDER! You have the nerve to show up with an incomplete order and expect me to be happy and he asked for a tip. I refused to take an incomplete order, but I had already payed for the food. So I proceed to call the manager asking them to take what they brought me back and to replace it all in a timely manner (I did not want to wait another hour). She very rudely told me that I should take what was there and wait for the rest to arrive. To which I asked her if she liked to eat cold food, because if I waited for the other half of my food the half I received would be cold. Then she hung up on me! So I call back, and by now I'm LIVID. I ask for the manager again, and when she received the call she told me that \"this is how she does her business\" and to \"stop calling her with complaints.\" Needless to say, I cancelled my order and demanded my money back and told her that she had lost a valuable customer (I eat A LOT of Thai food, and have been looking for a place, so she lost my $50 a week). This place lacks good customer service and management and should be closed until they learn to respect the people that keep their doors open.",

I just checked out Basil Thai Fusion and their pad Thai was so bad, I literally only took one bite! Oh, and her beef jerky is delicious too. I always ask for the heavily peppered flavor. I've never dined in before but, I've seen karaoke going on in there one night lol. Really comfortable environment. If that's not your thing and you really want to dine in, Lotus of Siam on E Sahara is one of the best in town as well.",
