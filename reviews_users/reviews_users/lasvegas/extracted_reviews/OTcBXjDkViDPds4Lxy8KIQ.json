    "text": "Absolutely delicious! And a lot more reasonably priced than I first thought. I only heard about this place from Marianne Y last month during Sloppi Jo's debut. I was happy to find out that it's close to work.  I went with a Pork Verde Combo Burrito for $4.95 and chose to have it smothered in sauce for an extra $1. The guy warned me that the Pork Verde is spicy, but I was good with that. For $3, you can add a Sopapilla and two sides. I wanted to try their Green Chile Stew and compare it to Sloppi Jo's, so I ordered the Sopapilla, the stew, and some rice.  When I got back to work, I first dug into the stew. The heat hit me right away. It was almost overwhelming, but I soon acclimated and the flavor came through. I think I give the slight edge to Jolene's Green Chile Chicken Stew, but I would certainly get Carlito's version again. The burrito was spicy, but I think the stew had already seasoned me to the heat by then. At $5, the burrito is huge and definitely value for money. I only ate half of it and am saving the other half for tomorrow. As for the Sopapilla, I was impressed at how soft and fluffy it was. It came plain and yet it was somehow still delicious and totally addicting. I dipped it in the burrito's sauce until I reached the very last tasty morsel.  I hate it when I have high expectations for a place and it doesn't shine. I always feel like my disappointment is due to my inflated anticipation. I'm extremely glad this isn't the case with Carlito's. I do declare that I have a new lunch destination in my regular rotation!  Update: I just ate the rest of the burrito and noticed a couple of honey packets in the bag. Oops. Those are probably for the Sopapilla. Oh well. It was delcious all by itself!",

    "text": "Horrible food. Filth everywhere and they tried to feed my vegetarian boyfriend chicken.   My boyfriend and I stopped here after reading the great reviews. I was also cool to see Santana, or a Santana look alike, had eaten here. I ordered the carne asada sopapilla, which is a dough shell stuffed with beef covered in sauce. It was NOT good. The pictures of it and of the rest of the food look amazing and so delicious, do NOT be fooled, for the opposite is True. The red sauce tasted like it has cinnamon in and it tasted old, almost sour-like. The sopapilla was raw on the inside and soggy on the outside- disgusting. I took a few bites to curb my starvation and left the rest.  My boyfriend ordered cheese enchiladas and they gave him chicken ones. He went over to the counter to let them know of the mistake and they ignored him for a good 6 minutes. Then the lady working the cashwrap/kitchen stared at him like he was some sort of weirdo for standing there trying to get her attention. He finally told them of the mistake and she looked the food over as if in disbelief. They made him new enchiladas. The tortillas were hard and stale on the ends and covered in that horrible sauce. He couldn't eat them after 2 bites so we left.   The benches were dirty and needed a good wipe down. The tables had stacks of dirty plates on them and flies circling them. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or moped in ages; there was a thick blackish film with different colored bits of lint and trash all around the edges, sooo gross. Oh and a drunk man greeted us when we first walked in. Not sure if this place is aware but you're supposed to cut off customers when they're that inebriated, it could save their life!   Anyways, we left and got tacos at this little taco shop called tacos Tijuana.",

    "text": "Great googly-moogly, this place is awesome.  Absolutely one of the best burrito shops on the eastside of town.  If taquerias all carry a taste of their home region, Carlito's is the New Mexico taqueria and the theme is hatch chiles.  Spicy, delicious hatch chiles.  Red ones.  Oooohh ooooh ooohh, green ones.  It's a burrito shop.  And a damn good one, but what sets it aside as one of the best in town is the chile sauces.  The green chile sauce is exceptional.  So good that you don't even need a burrito.  Their green chile stew is spicy and delicious--with well-prepared potatoes and beef.  Mmmm mmmm good.  Add in the deliciousness of a tasty burrito--pork verde, carne adovada, carne asada, chicken.  Each one delicious.  And the option to get it smothered in cheese and the previously-mentioned delicious chile sauce.  Flat out one of the best taquerias in Vegas.  A must visit for a Mexican food lover.",

Big but manageable. but this place holy moly hahaha I'm 6'9\" and a husky guy.  This burrito is 2 meals for me.  So if you're an average person... Expect a mexican thanksgiving meal.  I had a combo burrito with veggies and chicken in it and it was pretty good.  The staff was very friendly.  And what was refreshing is that even though i'm new they didnt give me the \"please hurry up and order attitude\" The lady was just real courteous and kind of gave me that \"let me help ya out\" mom feel.  Also ordered smothered fries (a meal in itself unknowingly) and i'll admit i like it more than Roberto's carne asada fries.    I like this place a lot and when i want some comfort mexican food... I'm definitly going to return business here.",

    "text": "For someone who claims to dislike Mexican food, my reviews sure speak differently. Carlito's Burritos are a mammoth of a meal. Being raised in Vegas, it should not come as a surprise that everything is super sized or all you can eat. With this place, their monster wrap might as well be totted as a buffet in itself.   Katrina M. has been raving about this restaurant and the spice factor of the food. If there is one flavor that I cannot get enough of, it is spiciness. I came in ready to regret my decision, but it was more well rounded than that. Between myself and a friend, we shared a pork verde combo burrito with rice and black beans. It comes with an option to smother it. I suggest the green chile sauce because it definitely adds a distinct kick. We added a sopapilla, green chile stew, and a salad for three dollars more. I am glad that we split this meal because it would be near impossible to polish everything off by myself. For ten dollars and change, this is the most filling, high quality, and cheap meal you will be able to get.  The pork was tender and moist. The mellow flavors of the inside are accentuated by the subtly bold bite of the green chile that covers the entire burrito. The dressing for the tossed salad was too oily and lacked an acid to balance it. The green chile stew is the same as the one that we asked for on the burrito, but it was delicious enough to warrant another side. We had thought that the sopapilla had been forgotten. As I was about to speak up, they came out with the freshly fried morsel and a bottle of honey to accompany it. The bread had a nice airy quality while producing a chewy bite. I love any variations of a donut and they make one of the best.   It is hard to continue my \"I dislike Mexican food\" stance with such high quality places such as Carlito's around.",

    "text": "I was born and raised in Las Cruces New Mexico.  This is not Mexican food.  I know what you are saying.  \"But, Ernesto the sign says Carlito's Burritos, it's gotta be Mexican food.\"  No, sir this is New Mexican cuisine, and this is how we roll!  All you Cali people can take your tacos and tapatio hot sauce somewhere else.    We learned about this place from a friend who is also from New Mexico about a year ago and I almost started crying when I ordered food in Las Vegas with real hatch green chile.  This is my comfort food spot.  Every time I get a little home sick I know I can count on Dave and his staff to cook up some excellent food straight from the recipe book of Nuevo Mexico!    My recommendation if you have never feasted on genuine New Mexican food is to try out the stuffed sopapillas.  This is something you don't see done in California and they are awesome.  This place also has some daily specials.  I am personally a fan of green chile more so than red chile.  My mom makes the best red chile so it's hard to compare to other places.  Also don't be a sissy when you eat here.  We like our green chile and we like it hot.  spicy food is alway the best food anyway.  I can go on an on about Carlitos and I can even try to explain what New Mexican food is but I can't.  You just need to try it to see why your life has been incomplete before eating something spectacular from a cool state!  Cheers! and speaking of cheers they have $1 draft beers too!",

    "text": "This place has been on the radar for some time, we just haven't had time to try it. Today we managed to compromise, I'd eat nachos and my husband would eat his favored \"plate lunch\".   We arrived for I thought a late lunch, around 145pm, but found a line almost out the door and hardly a seat in the place wasn't occupied. I stood in line studying the menu and when it was time to order I had added the Navajo taco to my original craving of nachos.   I was surprised to see fry bread on the menu, and quite pleased when my order was ready. The Navajo Taco was a fry bread topped with pork Verde or carne adovada, cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes, I choose the pork verde, boy was it delicious, soft almost falling apart before I had a chance to chew it. It was just spice enough not to cause a sweat.   My order of nachos was just the usual, they put the beans and cheese, cheddar & jack, on the bottom as well as throughout the chips, then layered with olives, scallions, tomatoes, green chile, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole and I added beef. It was a really good nacho!   Even though my husband was going to eat a plate lunch just up the street, he couldn't resist what was before him and I think he ate as much as I did, it was a really good lunch. I will be back to try other items I spied on their menu.",

I cannot believe I waited so long to try this wonderful place, and now all the buzz and reviews make sense.    I placed a to go order with a friend.  We ordered a combo burrito and tacos.  The burrito was absolutely gigantic.  And when they \"smother\" a burrito, they really mean \"drown\" it - but in the best way possible (if there is a good way to drown something, I mean).  It was packed with meat and all the \"fixins.\"  The tacos were absolutely to die for.  They are crispy but not greasy.  The steak was amazing; perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  They were topped with the freshest and most delicious lettuce and tomatoes I have had from a restaurant.  Straight from the garden ya'll.  We ordered a few sides, too.  The refried beans are killer; they are not smashing smooth, they have a really nice texture and amazing flavor.  The rice wasn't great, but I'm not holding that against them.  Just not my type of flavor.  The green chile stew was super yummy, but very spicy.    The yelp 5 star rating says it all: \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\"",

    "text": "The staff you currently have on Tuesday nights is lackluster at best.   I kept waiting to say something hoping it was just a fluke but unfortunately that is not the case. It just keeps repeating itself.  Example: The gal working at the register at 400PM yesterday acted as though customers were interrupting her.  She stood at the bar (customer side) talking to one of her departing co-workers (seated at bar) for several minutes.  This left an older woman standing at the counter with no one even acknowledging her.  A big order needed to be packed up and she just stood staring into outer space while the other gal pack up all the food.  It appears she couldn't even help put 1 lid on a bowl.   No teamwork in a place this small is apparent to all of the customers.  We ordered items that were forgotten and then given the \"evil eye\" when we stated we were  missing the item.  After waiting several more minutes I walked up to the counter and was asked \"have you already placed an order\" in a rude tone. Customer orders all come out at the same time regardless of when tplaced.  Example I got my order at the same time as a customer ordering 10 minutes later.  We have been loyal customers for quite sometime and sing your praises to all we can but don't know if I can continue to do that. This never happened when Eileen was there on Tuesday nights.  Perhaps you need to have a strong team leader on duty for Tuesday nights when I know it gets hectic.  As a member of the staff there please don't treat customers as though they are a nuisance and that you shouldn't have to be bothered.   Thanks!",

I ordered the beef burrito with green sauce. Its a good-sized portion, and the green sauce is pretty good. The burrito itself was like a flour bag of plain beef with jalapenos thrown in. Lots of heat, but no flavor at all or seasonings in the meat. So I wasn't impressed at all with this item. I will go back and try something else next, hopefully that may be a bit better!",

I always order a sopapilla on the side so I can eat it with honey at the end of the meal. The only thing I have had here that I think could use some improvement is their calabacitas. I would love to see them add fideo to the menu at some point too.",

The pork is fork tender, perfectly seasoned, and the green chile has a great flavor and heat as well. Have been back many times and have had no complaints. I have had the tacos, sliders, burritos, and simply ordered the pork verde with green chile. All is amazing. Never had the red chile- I'm strictly a green man! If you like authentic New Mexican cuisine, this is the place for you!! If you want Tex Mex or Americanized Mexican- go find somewhere else to eat as this is not the place for that.",

When Carlito's opened up, I was so very excited that I could get some authentic green chile and real deal Navajo tacos. After my first visit, I was not disapointed. Since that first visit almost 6 months ago, the wife and I have been back many times, and the food always continues to satisfy. I typically get the Navajo Taco or stuffed sopapilla minus meat. The beans are always great, the rice is fantastic, and frybread/sopapilla's are delightful. The green chile varies in heat each time, but the fact that it is New Mexican green chile that is either fresh or frozen fresh makes it all good. We've recommended Carlito's to many friends, and all our meat eating friends say that the pork and beef are both very good. We also like the $1 drafts and I don't really care if its not a fancy beer, its good, cold and goes well with the food. The margs are also good for the price. The staff at Carlito's is great, always friendly and they remember who you are if you've been there more than twice.",

    "text": "Carlito's is a very unique restaurant with familiar items on the menu.  The new mexican cuisine is based on mexican food, but with inspirations from native american and southern cuisines.  I have been here many times, and have many favorites on the menu.  The carlito's burrito is a large burrito with only meat, and red or green chile.  The grilled steak burrito with green chile is my favorite.  The green chile is bold and flavorful, and the steak is grilled fresh to order and cut into big, tender slices.   The tacos are another favorite of mine.  I usually get the grilled steak tacos, but the chicken and the ground beef are also very good.  The tacos are fried slightly to make the tortilla crispy.  The only criticism of the tacos is that they are served with a very small amount of salsa.   The specials at Carlito's are also very cool.  Tuesdays is Taco Tuesday where they serve tacos for only a buck.  They have an everyday special for their Carlito's Beer which is also only a buck.  Their best special, though, is on saturdays.  Every saturday they serve a 10 oz. Ribeye Steak with cheese, green chile, mashed potatoes, and calabacitas (squash, corn, and tomato succotash).  This ribeye is only 10.95.   Overall, if you enjoy unique new mexican cuisine, you should definitely try carlito's.",

It is family owned so when you come in the faces are usually the same and they very warm & welcoming.   I usually get the Green Chili Stew which is by far my favorite from the menu. It's pretty spicy, has an extreme kick to it. If your palette can't handle spiciness, I wouldn't recommend this stew. The portions are pretty good size. I've ordered chicken nachos here before and boy were they good and I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself.  The Sopapillas are delish as well. I usually just get it regular without any add ones. They bring out honey to put on it. Oh my gosh, it is so warm fluffy. yum!  They have $3 margaritas everyday so that's a plus. Prices are reasonable. Overall, great place!",

On Sundays they have 2 for 1 breakfast burritos which is so unheard of. I ordered the ham breakfast burrito with extra ham and a carne asada burrito. The ham was GREAT! This one on its own gets 4 stars! The carne asada however was an epic fail! With carne asada being a staple it is suppose to shine in its own way, and if you can't get it right in a burrito there is no hope LOL! This burrito gets a one star because of the taste and because I got food poisoning!

It was a bit of nostalgia for me as I had had a really gigantic version of this dish a long time ago on a Grand Canyon tour. The Carlito's version comes in a metal tin (like a lot of their dishes do, apparently) and has a lot of meat (I chose pork verde over carne adovada), shredded cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was pretty enjoyable, but not enough so that I would go back every day. I haven't felt the urge to try it again yet.  The second time I went was so that I could finally take advantage of their Sunday all-day 2-for-1 breakfast burritos. The basic burrito is scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile for $5.50, but I did the one meat option for $6.50. Yes, that's two for $6.50 at the special price.  I tried all the meats, and chorizo is definitely the best, with bacon a reasonable but not so meaty second and the sausage and ham options not really providing anything special that would make me want to order them ever again. I'm probably going to stock up on 6 of these or so one of these days for an entire week of breakfast burrito-y goodness.  Carlito's is simply a great, cheap local spot for New Mexican cuisine. Try to go at off-peak hours because seating and walkways are really cramped in there.",

The steak tacos, dry and no flavor served on a stale fried and hard flat corn tortilla. I ate 2 bites of the cold dry steak tacos. I could not swallow the dry meat. I even tried to smother a taco in their plain boring salsa but it didn't help. They look more like a tostada with no beans. Very weird taco experience. Not the hot jucy flavorful steak one expects. The chili relleno was ok but not great. Again, no flavor and no spice.  I'm really disappointed.",

I came to the conclusion that there has to be something else people are eating that makes this place rave because this just tastes meh! to me. It really is spicy and the pork is cooked well, but there is no depth to this burrito. I also felt the it had an excessive amount of salt, which probably drowned lot of the natural flavor.    I may go back to try another item on the menu, but this one didn't work out for me.",

I finally stopped by and I the lady was super helpful.  She just had the perfect way for you to order while explaining to you what you are getting.  I got a Carlito's burrito. It was all meat. I didn't get it with beans or anything. The steak they use is delicious. You can get red or green sauce and also can get it smothered. I got christmas which was red and green mixed.  My food was good!   We got a frito pie also which was huge!   The sauces are spicy but SO GOOD!   I joined the mailing list and I was happy to get an email. I thought the lady was lying.  All in all awesome service and awesome food.",

I tried it for the 3rd and final time and I can't give Carlito's any more chances.  Terrible food! I am not sure why their food has been consistently bland, watery, and put together carelessly... But it is so bad. I have eaten here a few times since their move, trying different things in an attempt to find something edible... No dice. It's just NOT good food in taste, quality or presentation. That is the reality.  Rude owner and staff. He seems like he has a major attitude. I have personally dealt with him over the phone before, not the most pleasant person, but I can overlook a grumpy demeanor most of the time... Until I decided to browse through the reviews and read his bitter and childish responses to customers. Now I am actually glad I won't be giving this place my business anymore (along with most of the people I know who used to eat here). Honestly if you can't handle harsh criticism, don't own a restaurant. Also find new staff or something, they aren't any more pleasant to deal with and make the experience uncomfortable. This entire establishment needs an overhaul, and I am not sure that would be enough to fix it's crashing reputation in the area.  Health department grade of C... Need I say more?  If you guys are looking for sub-par, overpriced \"New Mexican\" food that is basically a sad imitation of what it should be then by all means eat here. If you actually do have taste buds, eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "Another bookmark. Check. Based on my rule of thumb, I usually get the namesake because it should be a safe pick right?  So I get the Carlito's Burrito. Peep this. Double meat (no rice or beans). Your choice of meat. (Beef, Chicken, Chorizo, Carne Adovada, or Pork Verde for 7.35) Steak is 8.35 and Shrimp is 8.95.  You can choose to smother it enchilada style for a dollar more. You can add complimentary toppings upon request. (Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Cilantro, Salsa, Pico De Gallo, Pickled Jalepenos, and Serrano Peppers)  Guacamole is 75 cents and Sour Cream is 50 cents.  I chose steak with everything except for the Guacamole and Sour Cream. They ask you if you want the red or green sauce. They told me the green sauce was more spicy so I got the red. (I still ended up sweating profusely so I am assuming the green must be really spicy)  The taste? Pretty good! You have chunks of steak mixed with all the fixins. Every bite was as good as the last. If you refer to my pic, the size of the thing can be intimidating. But if you are really hungry you should be able to finish it.  Service was decent. You order, pay, wait, and receive your food. Enjoy. Keep in mind since they only have one register, on really busy days you just might wait a while.  Location. Ummm, its a decent sized place for where its at. From the outside it looks small, but when you come in, there are enough tables and chairs for about 20 people.  So next time, I will try other some of the other tasty options since the Carlito's Burrito was so good.",

Carlitos popped up on yelp as a nearby Mexican restaurant so sight unseen we decided to try it. Never heard of it before and didn't have time to read the reviews.    We were absolutely blessed!  The counter gal was friendly, and the patrons obviously were regulars and as we stood in line, they shared with us what to order.  The comment we heard a lot was \"everything is good!\" and yes it was.  My chicken taco for $2.25 was so ono-licious (in Hawaiian that means broke-da-mouth good) and hubby's steak burrito was ono-ono-licious.  The sauce on the burrito was amazing.    We will definitely come back again! Carlitos Burritos NO KAI OI!  (In Hawaiian that means VERY GOOD!!)",

The service when attention was brought to food flavor was an \"I don't care\" type of attitude no effort was made to fix the situation all we got was a \"well do you want something else\" as we were leaving. The original location we were made to feel like family. This new location was just \"next\" mentality  and on to whoever is next in line. Total dissapointment.",

But, if you're sensitive to spicy foods, watch out.  If you're hungry, get the combo burrito ($5.95). It's a veggie burrito with meat. You get your choice of beans (I opted for pinto) plus rice and calabacitas. If you're like me, you'll probably have to ask what that is. Calabacitas are sauteed squash, onions, corn and peppers. I also went with the pork verde as my meat choice. If you do want it spicy, get it smothered with your choice of red or green sauce or both. Without the sauces, the food is perfect for people who don't want their mouth on fire. It's probably one of the best burritos in town (at least from what I've tried) and a great value.  Order at the counter and they'll bring the food out to you. Even during non-peak hours the place can be busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. But, it will be worth it.",

So NO, I didn't want to take the food with me.I attempted to pay for the food I ate even tho your manager was being rude and unprofessional. But she was so angry that I didnt like the other food so she kicked me and my wife out. I asked to speak with you personally but YOU NEVER SHOWED UP. You should update your menu and STOP Falsely advertising as a barbque restaurant. Because you're not...FAR FROM A BARBQUE RESTAURANT. And the food you do serve is completely under seasoned, taste like you and your managers personal recipe. I would HATE to be a guest at your house for dinner, especially if you think that food is good  FUTURE CUSTOMERS BEWARE!!! HORRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE!!! And one thing, the reason I told your manager to call the cops is because she tried to MAKE me take and pay for the food I didnt want.",

The burrito had cheese in it, although I ordered with no cheese. I paid $2 extra for steak, but there was hardly any in the burrito. Flavor is average. The soda wasn't even cold. No hot sauces or anything. I can think of 50 better places to get Mexican food in Las Vegas, even Taco Bell. What a waste of money.",

    "text": "Visited Carlito's Burritos to purchase a 30 pound sack of Hatch, New Mexico chiles. It is chile season and Carlito's had 30,000 pounds available. You could purchase them roasted or not. The roaster was set up out outside next to the patio and only takes about five minutes.  The trip across town was a good reason to experience their lunch.  Food ordering done at the counter and delivered to your table. Non alcoholic beverages are self serve. The line at noon time moved quickly and the wait time after ordering was short.   I started with a small bowl of Green Chile Stew. Great flavor, right amount of heat. The stew was loaded with fork tender pork and many chunks of potatoes. The large size would be a complete meal in a bowl. Next was the Chile Rellenos. 2 battered Hatch green chiles stuffed with jack cheese and smothered with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. These chiles were large and enough to take one home. A side order of pinto beans were tender and flavorful but could have used more garlic for my taste.   The restaurant had plenty of staff to deliver food and were efficient in removing empty dishes.",

Immediately upon walking in I felt a coldness.  No, one greeted me! One customer did look at me oddly, I guess I'm a lil \"slow\" cause I still didn't think anything of it! Three people were behind the counter, and another guy next to the counter at the drink machine, a customer ordering, one leaving. So, I took a menu, looked at it, then walked over to the guy who was at the drink machine and politely asked \"where's your restroom.\" He said \"what\" so I repeated it! Where is your restroom? He looked at his co workers looked at me and shrugged his shoulders and said \"I don't know!\" I said you work here and don't know where your restrooms are?!?! He just looked at his coworkers! I asked what's the problem, (I clearly new the problem) So at this point I returned the menu to the basket and said I definitely don't want you guys making me any food! No, one said anything and I left! Yes, all the workers and customers were white, and yes I am black. I am cool with that. I'd rather that!!! I just know that will never get my business! #makingAmericagreatagain  Your response is very typical, and laughable!!!!!!!",

After seeing reviews of Carlito's Burritos, I desperately wanted to come by and try them out.   Today, I ordered the breakfast burrito with ham/sausage/bacon. The burrito was a decent size but smaller than I expected. The burrito was definitely hearty and they are generous with their ingredients. Most breakfast burrito spots will try to fill their burritos with fillers (potato, rice, etc), but this burrito was 85% egg & meat and 15% potato. I liked that the hash browns in the burrito were extra crispy. It adds additional texture to the burrito.",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     18/100  After seeing a friend's (Micah O.) photos, of the smothered burritos and constant check-ins for this place, I just had to try this place out!   The smothered burritos are what lured me in. I want. I needed it in my belly.   I wanted to try the burrito (the normal way) but I'm currently on a low carb diet (health reasons) so I got the Pork Verde Burrito Bowl with Green Chile Sauce and everything on it. I asked for no rice and all black beans. It also came with corn and sliced squash. Which was great because I love squash.   I didn't know how hot the chile would be so I stuck with the green. She said they didn't make it too hot today, so she recommended the green. I didn't want to risk getting something too spicy so I went with the green. The green was mild, no spice (at least for my taste). I wish I had gotten the red sauce too! Next time I will definitely get the red! I added Tapatio, but it clearly needed the red chile sauce.   The pork was tender and flavorful. I really liked it.   Next time, I will get it with both sauces and I will try what my friend recommended, the breakfast burrito. His recommendation is get it with both red and green sauces, with everything on it.   My friend got the steak bowl, I tried a piece, it was tender and okay flavor wise for me. My friend enjoyed it. I still preferred the pork. I will have to try the other meat choices next time.   Also, the way it is set up, you order and pay at the counter first, then they give you an order number and bring the food to you.    The lady at the cash register (I think her name was Debbie) was kind and very helpful with questions for us newbies. For me, the customer service is what makes or breaks a place.  Another lady was the one that brought the food to us and got our order numbers mixed up, no big deal, but she needs to get on top of that.   The restaurant is clean, well decorated and spacious. Women's bathroom at the time I went, one stall was out of toilet paper and no paper towels in both dispensers.   Looking forward to trying other items on the menu.   All in all, I really like this place and prefer it compared to some other Mexican restaurants. As far as burritos are concerned, this place is on point.  TIP: P.S. SUNDAYS - Burritos are buy one get one free!  Happy Hour - Monday-Thursday 3-6pm!",

Stuffed sopapilla with Adovada, smothered in green Chile with rice and beans. Outstanding as usual! One of the cool things here. Is they give you a Sopapilla with honey for dessert when you order rice and beans with your meal.   Second visit I had the breakfast burrito with sausage, bacon, smothered in Green Chile. It's very good!   Here's a hint after reading some of the other reviews. If you're  not going to have the red or green Chile on your meal ? This place is probably not for you. There are plenty of taco shops and Mexican restaurants in Vegas that have better tacos and enchiladas. The thing that sets this place apart! Is the New Mexican style red and green Chile!",

Now, if you wonder what the difference between chile types is...well, the anaheim is smaller, but spicier and has more flavor. Once you've had them this way, you will always be disappointed by the poblano.  The sopapillas with honey are amazing!  Beyond that, their rice and refried beans could be better.",

Southwestern art, Indian pictures, etc. very awesome vibe.  Very simply this place is New Mexico plopped down in Las Vegas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is authentic, hot, fresh, and a plate of awesome. The burritos are the size of a 6 month old baby and can fill you up for the whole day. The green sauce is made with real \"Hatch\" chile's. can't wait to try the Indian Taco's   Like to give a shout out to the owners. Thank you for bringing N.M. to Las Vegas. Keep up with the great food!!",

    "text": "Up until Thanksgiving 2015 Carlito's Burritos was located on Patrick Ln. After an extended move they finally re-opened in new digs at the Sunset Rd. location, listed here. At the old venue they pretty much had it dialed in. It was consistently a pleasant dining experience. The food was good and the margaritas excellent. A good $3 Margarita is hard to beat.  My experience at the new location left me wondering if I had come to the right place. The margarita was awful. They've changed their mix and raised the price by a dollar. I can live with the price, but the mix is apparently something made in-house and it tasted too sweet, resembling toothpaste more than a Margarita. Apparently their distributor had been unable to supply their old mix to meet their proposed schedule and the owner decided to show the distributor who was boss and that was that. The result is Crest toothpaste and tequila and it is awful. I could not finish my drink even after the bartender offered to stiffen it up with more tequila. All I got was more potent toothepaste.  The menu is the same, but the food was dry and uninspired. I saw one familiar face there. All the rest looked like new staff and I wonder if maybe that contributed to the downfall in quality. End result: I won't be going back. Sorry!  Obviously the owner is just grabbing for the cash cow and allowing the product to suffer. I also learned from another customer (at the old place, actually, and subsequently verified) that tips left on credit cards never make it to the intended staff. The owner just pockets the tip money instead of remunerating his employees as the paying customer intended. Can you say \"fraud\"?",

It's pretty tiny inside but they have a good amount of seating and a nice little bar area up front.  The food was excellent! I've been seeing all the picture of those smothered burritos and had to have one. I went with the pork verde then added rice and beans. The pork itself was super tender, I loved the green sauce and their burritos are huge! My wife and son shared the chicken fajitas which they loved. They give you a lot of toppings for the fajita's and I believe the tortillas are homemade...awesome on both dishes. On the smothered burrito, the green sauce starts to soak in the tortilla making it really soft and chewy...sooooo good!  Biggest downer of this place for me...the chips. They have really good salsas and an excellent guacamole but the chips fell short in a big way. I don't know what the seasoning is on them but it lacks any salt and it's really plain. Add a little salt and they're better but still kinda disappointing. Otherwise I really liked Carlito's and will definitely be going back. Can't beat excellent food with cold beers for a cheap price!",

Something to do with hatch chiles.  All I know is that it was some good eating.  I was so ready to eat that I have no pictures of the food. I had two chicken enchiladas, a red chile pork tamale, and a side of black beans; the beans were not necessary after all that food--I had two bites.  Boyfriend had a stuffed steak sopapilla, a tamale, and a side of rice.  Not much talking, lots of scarfing.  Everything was so delicious, fresh, and cheap for what we ordered.  This is one of those places that has so many good things on the menu that it's hard to decide, so take a gander before you go.  I want to return to try some other items, like the Navajo Taco and the dessert sopapilla, and next time I'll remember to save room.",

The sopapilla is made fresh right then and there, then stuffed full with tender pork, smothered in green sauce. The green sauce is HOT and to DIE for.

It needed more variety with fresh veggies (but again I'm biased and used to making this at home). At home we use a little bit of Fritos and more beans and meat and chile topped with cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato and some sour cream on top. This was mostly chips and chile and was so heavy to eat that I only had a few bites before putting it aside.   I was also very excited to try the Indian tacos, which were just \"ok\" but again lacked the fresh veggies and just lackluster in flavor.   The green and red chile were not up to par either.

I liked the Indian bread they use as the taco shell. Unfortunately, the nachos were not good. There wasn't much meat and they were hard to find. The few pieces that seemed to be tossed in there were tiny and tough.   However, I really liked the other things enough that I could give them more stars. I'm not going to do that because the service was not great. The woman taking our order was unfriendly and impatient. She never smiled, said thank you or greeted us.   I noticed that the owner replied to other customers that said the same thing about the service. Either he did not talk to his staff as he said he would or he's just all talk because his staff is still unfriendly. To make things worse, his business received a C rating from the health department. That means they're not clean. It makes sense that they don't care about their cleanliness when they keep rude people like that on their staff. A business that doesn't care enough. I won't be back.",

For my gringo tastebuds, the green chili sauce is a little spicy, but the flavor is amazing. I had the chicken burrito, and I'm pretty sure they used a whole chicken given the size of this thing. The ground beef was also delicious, and not at all the cheap tasting product that so many ground beef burritos are.   It was 11am, so sadly I didn't try the margaritas (though it was five o'clock in Praia--an \"island nation off the coast of Senegal--thanks Wikipedia!). But my co-eaters espoused their deliciousness--I'll give them a shot next time.   Staff was friendly and I fully anticipate being back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

I ordered a breakfast burrito with green chili. I noticed it didn't say green chili on the receipt so I asked the cook. He confirmed it did. I got my order and got home to a burrito with no chili! I'm not a guy to complain normally but the fact that I double checked before I left with the cooks rubbed me the wrong way. I called and they said they would replace it. I was in a few days later to get my burrito. Before I left I confirmed with cooks if it had chili. I got home to a burrito that was ALL eggs hardly any bacon or hash browns and 2 very small pieces of green chili........come on guys....Also I know not too many people ordered the blue wedge salad and tried tip plates but my girl loved those and you guys don't have them anymore....please guys we used to come here weekly sometimes daily but we don't come anymore. I would rather go to Coffee Cup in Boulder City. They know how to do a green chili breakfast burrito right... Good luck guys..",

    "text": "Love, love, love Carlitos!  I first tried Carlito's about 6 years ago when a coworker would bring me their breakfast burritos.  They are so good and huge!  I was hooked.  I love anything green chile so the whole menu is a hit with me but my absolute favorite is the BBQ they do on the weekends.  In the cooler months they fire up the grill a couple Saturdays a month.  Tri tip, ribs, chicken and prime rib are a few of their offerings.  They do one meat a day.  You can get it  as an entree with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas or as a sandwich with cheddar cheese and green chile on garlic bread.  OMG.  It is so good.  They sell out fast so if you can't make early it is best to order in advance.  Ordering in advance will save your food but they don't make it until you get there.  I recommend calling when you are on your way so it will be ready.  I learned that the hard way when we ordered a nacho bar and a few racks of ribs for fight night.  I ordered in advance and stated a pickup time but had to wait almost an hour when we got there for the food.   I wasn't expecting the wait but they were slammed.  I can appreciate they want their customers to have the best product possible and didn't make it early to just sit there.  The recently announced that they are moving to the Galaxy Theater complex and in addition to Carlito's they are opening a Santa Maria BBQ spot Live Fire Q!  Now I can get their BBQ whenever I want!  No more waiting for Saturdays or worrying about sell outs.  No firm date yet but they are shooting for October.  I can't wait!",

However, it went back down when I cut into my burrito.  They put way too much rice and less beans in my burrito.  New Mexico is all about their refried beans and how great they taste.  Carlito's sauce was super hot, not like the kinds I tried out there.  My fiance did love his carne burrito, so that's one extra star for his enjoyment.    Don't plan on coming back here during my next visit to Vegas, I have to get it right or nothing.  Conclusion, if you're a meat eater, this will be a great place, you should check it out.  As a vegetarian, not so great.",

Just stood there looking very grumpy. That's when I noticed 2 signs... They basically stated that you order with the guy for to go orders and go to the other register in the dining room if you are dining in.   As we were dining in, we walked to the other register... Mind you the entire time I was reading the signs the grumpy guy did not say one word just stood there looking at us....A little weird and a little uncomfortable. The only time is answered was when my bf asked him a direct question and it was more grunt and answer.  BUT on the other hand the lady at the register for dining in was very friendly. I was like whew... Finally a friendly face....Lol service 3/5...5 for the lady and 0 for the grumpy guy  Ambiance was ok. It was very very roomy. And I liked the decor and I loved the little tiny paw print that was in the tile on the wall behind me. So cute!!!! And it was very clean since they had just opened.  5/5  Food is where I was kind of torn. I came specifically for the Indian bread as I was craving it. I got the Indian bread taco with pork Verde. The pork was very flavorful... BUT they drenched the entire taco in the sauce for the pork which totally sogged out the entire dish. The Indian bread also was teeny tiny. Normally when you get an Indian taco the Indian bread is circular and you get the crunchy fluffy bites of the bread to eat with your meat. When I got my dish the Indian bread was hidden breathe the mountain of meat and toppings...I guess most people would like that BUT I wanted the Indian bread.... The pork was tender and flavorful don't get me wrong.... It tasted great but the Indian bread was too soggy and it was dare I say it....Too much meat!! Wow I thought I would never say that... There was just no balance between the meat and everything else ratio. :/  I do want to go again and try some of the other things but as it is kind of far from me... Don't know when that'll be.",

The restaurant was dirty and leather on benches and chairs all ripped up.  We were there 10 minutes before anyone approached us.  Couldn't tell who the staff were.  Ordered are meals and chips and salsa from very indifferent young lady.  We got our sodas but that was about it. Never got our chips and salsa. Never got our food.  People who came in after us were eating.  After finally getting someone's attention asked about our food and chips and salsa.  Our food came out along with the chips and salsa and was told the girl never ordered the chips and salsa, which by the way were the worst chips we have ever had. The salsa was ok. Now to the food that was probably sitting up under the lights for a while for it was not hot, was bland, unseasoned and the worst New Mexican food I have ever had.  I don't have any idea how this place has 4 stars.",

Well if you haven't then come try this place because you won't be disappointed. The big difference between Mexican food and New Mexican food is that all the food comes with their signature New Mexican Chilis. You can choice between Red of Green chili and depending on what part of New Mexico you visit, they will try to sell you on which one is better. It all depends on what you are in the mood for. You can't go wrong with green hatch chili on a burrito. I went with that choice and it was amazing. The burrito was large in size and stuff to the core. The chili just gave it that extra flavor that made it top notch. Make sure you also get a Sopapilla which is a tortilla looking desert that is just tasty.   I would give them 4 stars but it was just a busy day when I visited and the cashier took my order wrong. No fault to her I get she was busy and it was a honest mistake. Will return!",

    "text": "My wife and I have eaten at Carlito's several times (both dine-in and take-out) and it has become a go-to spot for great burritos.  My wife has an intolerance for gluten so she gets the enchiladas or tacos.  She enjoys both.  I almost always get the Combo Burrito with carne adovado and covered in red sauce.  The red sauce is a roasted chili sauce that is spicy but not overly spicy; but it might be a bit much for some.  The green sauce is excellent, too, with a nice hint of citrus.  And you can get both: one inside and one out!  I've had other meats in the burrito including beef and pork verde.  All were good but the carne adovado is what was uniquely delicious to my taste buds.  Chips and salsa are extra.  I would not spend the money on them; the chips are not great, the red salsa is rather mediocre (though it does also come with the delicious green sauce, too!) and the burrito is enough to stuff anyone.  We have gotten guacamole three times now.  The first time the guac. was delicious and very fresh.  The second two times were rather disappointing and once it was so old that it was brown and inedible, to me.  I would say take a look at it and see how fresh it is before ordering it.  I once got fish tacos and they were not the traditional fish tacos.  They are not served with cabbage or the usual zesty white sauce, but rather, they are just a traditional taco with fried fish.  I liked them even though it wasn't what I was expecting.  But I don't think I would order them again as long as there is a burrito to enjoy.  The interior is very cramped and quite worn.  Come for the food, not the ambiance.  But the food makes for great take-out.  So things are hit and miss on the menu, garnering a 4-star rating but the burritos are 5-star excellent so go for the burrito!",

My mouth is drooling as I'm writing this review. We came in just looking to grab a burrito and our cashier told us they were 2 for 1. Talk about a win win! The lady who took our order was so friendly and the way she talked to the customers you could tell they were repeat customers because she knew them by name and just has a way with people. Wish I got her name. Anyway, we ordered our burritos and took them to go and she packed it up with all the fixins as I had mentioned we were going to eat at the cemetery down the road. She put extra utensils and plenty of that delicious red and green chile and lots of napkins! I appreciated that greatly! It's the little things that matter,but into bigger things the food! My burrito was ginormous and stuffed with egg hash brown and bacon. Not bits of bacon huge pieces. At 6.75 normally priced they are definitely worth it. I could barely finish half! Smothered in green chile and cheese. Super yummy! My guy had the chorizo breakfast burrito and it wasn't that processed chorizo it was the real deal. Looked like ground beef. I will definitely be back to grab some more food next time I'm headed to the cemetery. Indian fry bread tacos?! Yes please!",

It makes a first visit unnecessarily confusing--there are multiple counters, no clarity about whether in-restaurant customers should order at the counter or sit, and a combined menu that looks too big for one kitchen to manage.  The good news is that Carlito's and Live-Fire-Q seem to have separate kitchens, making the menu manageable even if the dining room comes off as confused about its identity.  I tried the chicken enchilada with red sauce, figuring it is a staple and would give me a good sense of the place. The sauce was tasty; the chicken cooked perfectly well. Very standard. Nothing mind-blowing.  The same was True of my rice--good but not amazing. The black beans were the highlight--a beautiful color, cooked to be firm but definitely cooked through, delicious.  I wouldn't object to a friend suggesting this place, but I doubt I'll be back on my own.",

When I walked in I knew I was in for a treat. You can smell the Green Chile and it smells like I've walked into a real New Mexican restaurant back home.   I ordered a Green Chile bacon breakfast burrito. I was not dissapointed this is a legitimate New Mexican restaurant and I felt like I was eating a Twisters burrito back in Albuquerque.   The burrito was large and loaded up with plenty of bacon, egg, potato, and green chile.   I would love to sit down and be able to try a little of everything here. There is no place in Vegas to compare to because New Mexican cooking is completely differrent then a typical Mexican restaurant but it is better then any other place.",

Always go for more than 2 meats and get it smothered. Smothered burrito is a wet burrito with red or green chili sauce. You can taste the spices in addition to the dry chili.   On Sunday, they have a B1G1 free breakfast burritos and they have daily specials too. On Saturday, they sell rack of ribs with their own spices. They are also great.",

At Christmas we fed a group of 20 and got rave reviews on the carne adovada, green chile pork and enchilada casserole. For my husbands birthday party we picked up ribs (probably the best I've ever had), grilled chicken, sausages and tri-tip for a group of 20. Wow. So much good stuff. They always hit the mark. They have a discount program and offer $5 off your bill for every $100 you spend. All the more reason to go! A lot.",

Menu options were robust, props for having Fry Bread on the menu.  I went for a Carlito's Steak burrito instead, with their famous salsa verde.  The Salsa, instead of being deeply flavorful and robust, came off as thin and excessively salty.  The steak pieces were rubbery and tough, and tasted like they had been boiled instead of fire grilled.  Wish I could say better, but it simply wasn't the case.  Their menu items are tempting enough that i may go back and try something else.",

We started off with nachos full of cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, black olives, green onions, green chilies, and refried beans. My wife had blue corn enchiladas with a fried egg. I enjoyed Carlitos combo, with enchilada, tamale, and a taco. I noticed my wife's black beans were plain, my pinto beans had some small slivers of green Hatch chili.

I got my water refilled once by the server despite my waitresses making eye contact with me more than once and seeing my empty water and sangria. She never asked if I needed anything.

When I asked how do they separate the bags equally after they are roasted, they appeared to be confused, telling me they were 30 pound bags.  However, I reminded the young man that it's now 60 pounds minus the 10 to 20 they dropped on the ground putting the bags in the roaster. He said they eyeball it because they don't have a scale, except they don't really eyeball it because they are dealing with a broken register and a roaster that is difficult to close. When the young man asked his supervisor, I believe is probably his father and the owner, he looked offended and put off that I would even ask such a question, I guess I should just appreciate they were selling/roasting them, and just be happy with what I get! Which was probably the equivalent of 20 pounds roasted, not 30, because the kid that was taking them out of the roaster then thought it was funny when the young man tried to embarrass me and reminded him to make sure they were evenly distributed in the two bags. I should not have been made to feel bad simply for asking how the chile was handled once they were roasted and put back in the bags if they didn't weigh them.  Save yourself the headache, this place is unbelievably disorganized and the roasters are being handled by teenagers, go to Albertsons where they are cheaper, you get what you paid for, and you don't get attitude for a simple question.",

Nice size restaurant, it was our first time in so it was a little confusing, they made us pay first, some of us went to sit while we poured our own drinks. By the time everyone got to the table our food was being served. They got a couple of our orders wrong, which they gladly fixed but it was difficult at times to get a waitress. Over all we liked the food. Chips were yummy with the seasoning. I got a carne adovada taco, I didn't like it the meat didn't have much flavor and even though it was in sauce it was dry. But the Shrimp Taco was the complete opposite, so good, I will get that again. I had to get a Cinnamon Sugar Sopapilla, made me smile, fluffy, warm, fresh. Shrimp tacos and sopapillas FTW! I will return, the BBQ side should be open and I'll get to sample that as well. Hopefully they fix their glitches and thrive in their new location.",

I really can't picture paying 9 dollars for any kind of burrito so I go when they have a deal on them. They are completely stuffed with scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile PLUS  bacon, chorizo, sausage and ham. That makes for one really filling burrito. I go for the green sauce because it's spicier and I love spicy food. I would have to say don't smother it because it turns this thing into a fork and knife meal and that's not what breakfast burritos should be about. This place uses extremely fresh ingredients and I love that. The one Debbie downer would have to be that the guy running the register always seems to be kind of miserable, I wish they would hire someone that could greet you as you walked in the door and smile while they take your order.",

Growing up in Arizona, we had phenomenal Sonoran Mexican food in the southern part of the state, and good New Mexican food in the mining areas around Globe/Miami.  What we have in Vegas is California or even worse - east coast influenced Mexican food. No heat, no flavor, and so very bland.  The carne adovada at Carlito's could be a little more spicy for my taste, but I'd definitely recommend it to my friends. They do a lot of BBQ events in conjunction with wine/liquor tastings at Lees Liquors. Their green chili tri-tip and ribs are phenomenal. Huge servings and so delicious.",

The green chile is New Mexico chile, cooked a little untraditionally, but close enough to the real thing, that someone who has lived in New Mexico finds it somewhat familiar, but lacking the gustatory punch of really well-prepared New Mexican green chile.  The flour tortillas are of poor quality and have a tendency to fall apart.  The refried beans are so bland they border on baby food.  And the atmosphere, well, it's like a taqueria: noisy, cheap, crowded.  It's good for someone looking for a green chile fix, but probably not the place to eat for really good New Mexican food",

I told them 2 times just to make sure and when I got back to work I had corn and carrots in my burrito.  To some that may sound good but not to me.  I guess I should of asked if the rice came with that stuff but when I told them how I wanted my burrito that's how I thought it would come.

You can choose the meat and choose red or green sauce.  I chose to try chicken with red sauce.  I also ordered mine smothered ($1 additional) and with jalapenos.  The burrito was HUGE, and was packed with chicken and sauce.  I love that they covered my burrito with so much sauce that I had pools of it to use however I wanted.  For this size of burrito the price was pretty good.  I would say cheaper than most similar mexican places.  The sauce also had a good spicy kick to it.  My only complaint at all from this visit is the size of the seating areas.  It gets a little crowded as it was at lunch time and I bet it's even worse during school days with a High School right across the street.  Not a lot of room to sit, but cannot complain at all about the delicious food and the good service.",

It's New Mexico style which is hard to find in Las Vegas for some inexplicable reason. The green chili is spicy with bits of the green chili in it. This is as opposed to the blended and smooth version which can be equally good. I ordered stuffed sopapilla that is also a New Mexico specialty not easily found in Las Vegas,  Mine was stuffed with ground beef. The order was served in an aluminum to-go container. I received two sopapillas with cheese melted over them and surrounded by plenty of the first rate green chili. It was a generous and delicious portion. For those of you who crave green chili, I can highly recommend this place. One other thing. They have a nice selection of beers as well as margaritas.",

    "text": "Carlitos is awesome. Finally a place in Vegas that has REAL Green and Red Chile. Roberto's, Faustos, and any other bland place that uses can chile is no comparison. This place makes you feel like your in New Mexico with its authentic flavors. I know its not fair in comparing them to anything else here. I'm a little biased because I think New Mexican cuisine is far more superior then Tex-Mex, or Mexican. What I do compare is the style of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos. Hands down Carlitos has them beat. Any of there burritos you can get real red or green chile inside them as well as smothered. The nachos with red Chile powder sprinkled on the chips and green chile hidden inside give the nachos a taste that is incredible. Navajo Tacos and Stuffed sopapillas are amazing. You haven't had a real Frito pie until you try it with the red new mexico chile Carlitos uses. They also have $1 drafts and specials everyday. Like $1 Santa Fe sliders. A little burger, with chipotle sauce and onions and tortilla. Keep in mind that this is New Mexican cuisine and not the stuff everyone is use to who never been to New Mexico. Its definitely better and I'm glad I have a place to have my Red and Green Chile fix since I only go to New Mexico a couple times a year. Before I go, you give them your email and # they add you and you get 5% discount every time you dine. Until next time, Let's Eat!!",

    "text": "I initially found out about this place through a coupon service. The 1st three times I got the fries smothered in red chiles and a breakfast item. I dined in once and remembered that the service was pleasant. But tonight was eye opener. I called to place a pick up order and the lady I spoke to had a very bad attitude plus she took down the wrong order. I ordered a combo burrito and she took it upon herself to charge me for a Carlito's burrito which is a dollar more. She urged me to make up my mind about beans and rice because she had a line of people. I'm sorry but when I asked if I can place an order over the phone, and she saying yes, was guarantee that I was a paying customer, just like everyone else. If you don't have the integrity to treat all customers as customers, then don't take phone orders. I arrive 15 minutes later to pick up the food and when I arrived she was behind the cash register. She looked at me and then walked into the dining area to bus a couple of tables. So, as a customer who is present, now the empty tables are more important than the customer. I see the problem now. She is discriminant towards particular customers in an inconsistent manner. She had a tip jar that was filled, but to be honest with you, if she treated everyone like she treated me, that jar would have nickels and pennies. The whole transaction had no greeting, no thank you or appreciation for business and couldn't even muster up a smile. I had like 13 cents change, and that tip jar was not deserving of a penny.  The 2 stars was because my friend liked the burrito, and the fries I ordered had flavor.  I don't know how Zagat grades these businesses, but if they send secret shoppers they will see what I'm talking about.",

You can get flat enchiladas with an egg on top, stuffed sopapillas, frito pies, tortilla burgers, posole and much more.

Mine was with the Pork Verde, the \"taco\" is Indian Fry-Bread and it was a sort of a tostada - but on steroids. The service was fast and friendly. The place was packed - with a line out to the door by 1pm. So if you are having lunch get there early. Aclear indication that this is the real-deal. If you are looking for something a bit different than the usual Mexican, Tex-Mex grub, this is the go-to place. You will not be disappointed. Not to mention that the cost is reasonable.

    "text": "Another one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:  Nachos (no meat, $6.50) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=pyMpCBcJmA49t_wZ_fsfaA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcB...</a> Cheese Quesadilla ($3.95) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=E5aH0xwP8-Ja4poLxosfDw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcB...</a>  The Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcBXjDkViDPds4Lxy8KIQ?select=t8a_2kWuGFXYzHbB7ZQdZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/OTcB...</a> You have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.  The Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.  Overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.  Return Factor - 79%",

They were quite generous with the green chile and the sauce was so tasty.  Also ordered the sides of rice, retried beans and the sopapilla.  The rice and beans were okay, but the sopapilla had me at the first bite. It was piping hot and we drizzled it with honey and it was amazingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and eat again.",

The chicken tamales in green sauce were not as good.  I asked if they were made with lard.  I was told they were made with shortening.  Which I understood to be vegetable shortening.  However I am not sure.  Some people refer to lard as shortening.  In any event they were hard as rocks.  Even worse they tasted bland.    So we were both pleased, & disappointed.",

    "text": "I could write a one-line review of this place--  $10 for two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans, sopapilla, and a Mexican coke equals a happy belly.   But I'll elaborate a bit.  Yes, it is a great deal. Yes, the flavors are delicious. But the real winner here is the green chili sauce. Is this Adderall? No, it's Carlito's green chili. This sauce makes you feel good all over, like you were donating money to charity or listening to George Michael (both of which I did on the day in question, so obviously it was a super good day).   What I liked second best about the place was not its sopapilla (but really, eat that thing first when it comes out when it's hot and melty--it's not as good cold) or its Mexican coke (hands up if you h8 high fructose corn syrup) but how you can pick your sides. I'm not one for refried beans, but black beans make my heart sing out with joy, so getting to be all democratic and have a choice in my Mexican side dishes is casting a vote and knowing your candidate will win and be successful in office--I rocked that vote, my friends.  All of this is to say, try this place out. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (as much as something can be in Vegas can be in this sea of suburbia, amirite?) but if you seek it out, you won't be disappointed.",

The buritto was very good just a little messy, which is not a problem for me. The steak was very tender and almost melted in my mouth.

My wife had the vegetarian burrito smothered Christmas style (ofcourse) and she loved it. My daughter ordered the Frito pie and it was a little too spicy for her. I ended up eating it and loved it. Next time i'm in Vegas, this is the first place that I will visit.",

I confirmed which items were vegan with the owner via e-mail (most stuff - beans, veg, rice, sopapillas, chile sauces).  So basically you have a great variety of vegetarian choices and a good variety of vegan options here.  And the meat looks pretty good from what I've observed but not tried.  Ok, so let's keep in mind that this is NEW Mexican food.  Not Mexican.  Not tex-mex.  It's not supposed to taste exactly like Mexican food.  And it doesn't! It definitely has it's own character.  I got a burrito w/ beans, rice, calabacitas, and green chile sauce.  It was gigantic! Pretty tasty too.  But the real star of the day was the sopapilla.  OMFG, how has this not been a part of my life?! Light, pillowy pockets of dough that are toothsome yet melt in your mouth as you chew.  I'm in love!!  If nothing else, do yourself a huge favor and go try a sopapilla.  If you don't like it, call me and I will come finish it for you.",

Knowing myself, I would most likely choose a terrible dish with my luck.  I did get the Carlitos burrito pork verde and knowing if I'm going to be unhealthy for once, I better get it smothered.  Wrong decision there with the smothered adovado sauce as I wasn't a fan of it.  I'm glad I did get the pork verde as the chunks of meat on this thing was huge and tender.  I ended up eating only half after my buffet at the soda machines and taking the rest home along with the smell of the place on my clothes.  I think next time, I would love to get it not smothered and to thrown in those good looking nachos I had my eyes on throughout the night of other people's orders.  Definitely a place if you want a fix on some tender meat at a decent price.",

There were quite a few people behind me and I felt rushed and flustered. Apparently, I get order anxiety under pressure.   I was impressed with the final product. It was big but not giant and getting it smothered with green chili was the way to go. The only thing that I wasn's a fan of was the plastic forks and disposable metal pans. It is hard to eat a big burrito with plastic cutlery and it also isn't very eco friendly. That won't stop me from eating there again next time I am in town.",

When my son had a basketball game across the street from it, it was the perfect opportunity to give it a shot. The first problem was that the hostess/waitress only gave us the brunch menu, which only includes a small handful of very specific brunch items. I would have loved to have had the full menu to choose from. And after she took our order, we didn't see her again until I had to flag her down to ask for a check. I eventually had to get up and refill my drink on my own because she never checked on us or noticed we were there. I ordered the steak and egg quesadilla from the brunch menu and my son ordered a bean and cheese burrito, both of which just weren't very flavorful at all--even after adding salt. The chips and salsa were very average also. We did, however, enjoy the stuffed sopapilla dulce. That was good. So, I'm not saying don't give Carlito's a shot. Based on the Yelp reviews, maybe we just caught it on an off day. But, it certainly didn't meet the expectations we had.",

Not the case this time. I got a wet burrito with everything.  The green sauce was watered down. Barely any meat. I won't recommend or think about coming to eat any food here again.",

I ordered a chicken taco and cheese enchiladas as well as a few other items the chicken taco was amazing the enchiladas were terrible.  They forgot the red sauce so of course they were really dry but the cheese was overcooked & not even edible. Their salsa is like liquid pico de gallo all you can taste is the onion no flavor whatsoever. Really disappointed as I am a traditional New Mexican.",

Every now and then I just need my chile \"fix\" Carlitos never disappoints on nurturing my spicy comfort food demand. Both the red and green chile are delicious. They now have a BBQ section to try... the Trifecta with green chile is my suggestion to you. But you can never go wrong with their frito pies or breakfast burritos. I really appreciate they do a frequent diners club, trust me it pays off! Do  yourself a favor and head over for spicy southwestern comfort food the owner is from Los Alamos so we are talking authenticity here folks. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the counter service is sometimes slow. But trust me the food and sangria/margaritas are worth the wait!",

I ordered the carne adovada burrito smothered in green chile . I liked mine . It was a bit salty for my taste but yummy . My 7 year old ordered the chicken burrito with beans and rice . He loved his burrito . My big boy got a large Frito pie which we always hear about . He enjoyed it . But he thinks it  was a little lacking in the chile .  We also ordered some chips and guacamole . The guacamole was really good but I guess we aren't used to so much seasoning on tortilla chips . It was different but I guess my boys prefer plain tortilla chips . All in all it was a good meal .",

Ok, so the fry bread is called the \"Navajo\" taco and to me isn't even their best attribute.  The best thing about this place? THEY SERVE 3 ENCHILADAS INSTEAD OF 2!!! Maybe that's not a big deal to you, but 2 cheese enchiladas is just almost enough, every time! Also, you can choose green or red sauce with everything, EVEN SALSAS! Which you should splurge and get the extra chips, salsas, and house mad guac.  I think they only have one location, and it is for sure a family operation. I have always seen regulars when I go, and been treated like I am one. I have yet to actually try a burrito, but between the tacos and enchiladas, I am always happy. I have dined in as well as gotten take out orders and never once been disappointed.  This place could expand and I hope if they do, they keep everything the same. No need to change what is already great.",

Shrimp Taco with 1 shrimp....Steak quesadilla loaded with peppers and no meat at all.  A Chicken salad without any chicken, lots of lettuce.  I called to complain.....They told me the real cook was off and the guy on duty was new.  Good for you!  So, you want me to take crap food that I paid for, without even the content I paid for, so you actually stole product from me.  While you understaffed your restaurant so you saved in labor......and never offered to replace the order with the right and accurate products.....You deserve to go out of business.....your just not that great and your growth will suddenly stop because you have put profit before quality of product.

Plus we waited over 30 minutes for our food! Table next to us, 1/2 of them never did get their food and ended up leaving.

    "text": "I have a love affair with green chile. It's no secret. I would eat green chile on/in anything for every meal for the rest of my life, if I could. But not just any green chile - Hatch green chile from New Mexico. There just isn't anything that compares. And Carlito's gets it right.  Their burritos are huge, their stuffed sopaipillas monstrous. You can get a margarita for $3, finish off your meal w/ a flaky sopaipilla w/ honey. But that chile man... that chile. \"Smother\" whatever you order with it for a buck. It just occurred to me, I wonder if I could get it \"double-smothered\" for $2...  I've also been impressed with some of their daily specials, everything from pit-roasted prime rib and tri-tip steak w/ green chile to green chile and pepperoni pizza.   My absolute favorite thing about Carlito's, however, is that I can attempt to live my dream of green chile every day by purchasing 60 lbs of Hatch chiles from them every August. That's right: Carlito's purchases 40,000+ lbs of chiles, direct from Hatch, NM, and will sell them to YOU. You can even have them roasted in the parking lot for a few extra dollars. Then, take them home, set up an assembly line, and put together little \"packets\" of green chile to line your freezer with and thaw one each day. Last year we made it to April before we ran out.  Prices are typical of any large meat-filled burrito in town, but adding sides/drinks it can get a little pricier (but SO WORTH IT). Our family of 3 usually spends $35-$38 on a typical visit, and we always have leftovers.  Give it a shot, and see for yourself!",

The burrito said it had hash brown but the hash brown was like potato strings. I had hoped it had more hash brown in it. Overall the burrito was good but not great. I would definitely try something else again mostly since the salsa was very good.",

My stud muffin had some errands to run so as luck would have it we were on the other side of the universe from where we live which just so happened to be RIGHT BY CARLITO'S!!  Serendipitous! So we walk in and the place is small but PACKED!!  That's a good sign.  You could tell that these were ALL REGULARS too.  I saunter on up to the little counter staring at the menu overhead trying desperately to remember what I had decided I wanted to try.  I couldn't remember so I just told the guy that it was our first time and asked him what was the best thing they had.  He asked us if we like spicy and WE DO so he suggested the Chili Verde Burrito.... I got it Combo which is beans and rice and Eric (aka stud muffin, studster, baby maker, hubster, etc) got it Carlito's Way which is double meat.  My son ordered the chicken Nachos. (All three lunches with drinks plus tax & tip came out to under $30.) The service was fast and friendly!  When the food arrived (which was quickly despite being very busy) we were first impressed by the shear SIZE of the portions... HUGE!  More than enough to fill up my teenage son who can easily eat a large pizza by himself!!  The nachos are piled HIGH with everything you can imagine and the chicken is SO GOOD!!!  TONS OF FLAVOR!!!  Our Burritos were so big and smothered in green sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug in and both immediately started making noises you would normally hear coming from a bedroom but it was sooo good we couldn't help it!!  Just the right amount of hot without losing any of the flavor.  OH. SO. GOOD!  I still have half of mine left and will be having it for dinner tonight!!  I am a definite FAN of Carlito's!! There is not one thing negative I have to say about this place.  It is exactly what it should be.   So my taste buds and  tummy send many thanks Carlito's and to Jaime W for sending me there!!",

We frequent nearly every Sunday and enjoy their Chicken Breakfast Burrito smothered Christmas Style (Green & Red Chili) along with a $1 Carlito Tap Brew. Not only do we cash in on their 2 for 1 but they also offer a loyalty reward patrons can cash in on. We simply filled out a simple form and give our name after we order. After spending $50 you receive a credit for $5 on your next order; which, nearly makes your next trip free!  We love the early staff but strongly dislike the evening staff.  As they're popularity grows, seating can be a hassle. The atmosphere is extremely casual and I love football season at Carlito's. They have a few flatscreens and also don't shy from  accommodating their patrons with requests from their DirectTV listings.  If you are unfamiliar with this type of cuisine but are looking to cure your craving for spicy but flavorful... Try their Carne Adovada Enchiladas. It is a one of a kind entree that should have you coming back for more!",

I wouldn't call this place Mexican, it's more New Mexico, everything here really revolves around the 'chile' which is a great thing because it's delicious.    They have daily specials at night which seem great but so far I've only tried the bacon breakfast burrito smothered in green chile and Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red chile with a bunch of toppings.   The best bite that I've had from here was the Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red cause with several toppings.",

    "text": "Carlitos burritos has a neighborhood taco shack feel to it.  You order at the counter and service is friendly.  They serve homemade tamales, and serve the traditional fare - burritos, tacos, quesadillas - all with the typical options of pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, or veggies.   Portions are beyond generous and the prices are good, real good.  A couple can stuff themselves for around $10.  However, while portions were huge, flavor was not.  We found both our meals \"good enough\" but relatively bland.  I tried the chicken tamales, smothered in green sauce.  I found the sauce a bit goopy, and generally lacking in taste (something no chile verde sauce should have a problem with in the southwest where we have easy access to freshly roasted chiles).  The sauce had heat, but lacked any flavor complexities beyond that.  The tamales were fine - but again, not mind blowing, a bit lacking on the flavor.  We also ordered nachos and a burrito.  The nacho portion was HUGE!  If you're with a group of friends and want an appetizer doused in cheese, and sour cream (which definitely has it's place in the diet every now and then) this is the place to go.  However, besides the entire brick of cheese melted on top, other flavors were lacking - the beans were sparse, and we just felt a bit overdone by the time the dish was halfway consumed.   However, the bright spot was $1 pints of MGD!  Can't beat that price!   In summary, Carlitos is a nice little neighborhood joint that would be a great place to meet friends for some beer, cheesy chips, and some cheap Mexican food.  However, we were generally underwhelmed by the (lack of) flavors in our meals.  This was our first trip there, so I'd be willing to give it another go (the cheap beer will bring me back).",

    "text": "First of all, I have to preface this review by saying this is NOT Mexican food. It's New Mexican food, therefore it's American. Now, that being said, I LOVE this place! The food of New Mexico is so unique and different. The Navajo fry bread stuffed with  pork Adobada is incredible, and I get it almost everytime I go. The fries smothered with the green chiles and cheese are sooo good, still crispy and just perfect. It's always a tough decision on what to get because everything is great. The diable burrito is stuffed to the gills with huge shrimp, and their rice and beans are totally different than any kind you  can get anywhere else. I found the green chile to be spicier, and the red chile to be more earthier and smoky. If you can't decide, get them both in a version known as Christmas style, both red and green. And to top it all off, they even have their own signature beers for $1 a pint! It's a cool little hole-in-the-wall place with neat art from New Mexico, and you can buiy the chilies to go, either dried of made into their sauce. If you've never had the food of New Mexico, then this is the place for you to try some of their tasty food and experience their culture. I highly recommend it, and have never had a bad experience there. When I move, I'm gonna miss this place because I'm fairly sure there is no food like this available near Tampa. I LOVE Carlito's!!

Carlito's definitely rewards it's return customers.If you give them your phone number when you order, they will track your purchaes, and give you $5 for every $50 you spend.

New Mexican fare differs from other forms of Mexican food because it is focused around Hatch chilies.  This ingredient comes from Central New Mexico where all the stars align to produce this unmatched and unmistakeable chili.  The owner stays True to Senoran New Mexican cuisine and gives you the option to chose from red or green in most of their dishes. Some of my favorites include red chili adovada enchiladas layered style with a fried egg on top, green chili chicken enchiladas, and the nachos.  Also, there are always specials which are delicious (I love the ribs).  And don't forget to save room for a sopapilla for dessert!

    "text": "Please be aware that December 2015 the location has moved to: 4300 E Sunset Rd Ste A-5 Henderson, NV 89014  I bought a adobava \"navajo taco\", rice,beans, sopapilla, and a soda.  The total was around $10.  It wasn't that great of a value.  The meat was really good.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  The refried beans were really dry, which was kinda gross.  A \"navajo taco\" is apparently some sort of flat bread thing.  It was okay, but I think I'd rather just have a normal corn tortilla.  All in all the place is alright, but I don't feel I got my money's worth.  Edit: From 3 to 5 stars.  I was young and dumb when I wrote that review above.  While I'm still not into the navajo taco or the combo deal, there are a couple of items that are simply amazing that I love.  The carlitos special burrito is great.  Just meat and sauce.  No beans, no lettuce (which doesn't belong on a burrito anyways), no rice (which also never belongs on a burrito).  Gotta get it covered with sauce and cheese.  Both the red sauce and the green sauce have an appropriate amount of kick that makes it spicy but not overbearing.  I usually end up with the pork verde when doing the burrito.  The nachos are the best nachos I've ever had in my life.  The chips are seasoned with this stuff I can't explain.  They go real easy on the refried beans.  Guacamole is great.  There's a touch of sauce in there too (can't remember if red or green) which gives the occasional burst of spice.  No lettuce (doesn't belong on there anyways).  I usually get the steak which are good sized chunks and flavorful.  The best part is that they somehow found a way to get cheese on every bite.  Melted gooey/clumpy cheese.....yummmm",

    "text": "Was not impressed with this place. Friends rave about it - don't understand why. Stopped in on a Saturday night around 6pm to have dinner with a friend. Ordering went smoothly although the attitude given to me by another customer when I asked if he could hand me a takeout menu (since I couldn't read the board very well & the menus were sitting directly in front of him & I didn't want to reach over him) was truly uncalled for. If your patrons are going to be that unfriendly & attitude giving I don't want to go some place like that & spend my hard earned dollar. My friend ordered up the chips & guacamole & the Carlito's Burrito while I ordered up the Legumbres (Jicama, carrots, and cucumbers tossed in red chile and lime juice) & the Navajo Taco as well as a house margarita. We sat at our table & within 5 minutes a plate was set in front of my friend & she started eating it & I commented how it was strange not to get our Starters that we ordered before the main meal item. After about 10 minutes finally they bring out the starters we ordered as well as trying to set a burrito down in front of me. I told the waitress that I didn't order a burrito but had the Navajo Taco. She turns & looks @ my friend & says it's right there & points to the plate my friend has been eating on. My friend offered to give it to me but I said no & asked the waitress to please make me another one & she rolls her eyes at me! Seriously!?! Are you kidding me? Your going to tell me to eat off a plate that someone else has eaten a good portion of the meal? It was the waitresses fault to begin with because she firmly planted it down in front of my friend & never even made mention of what it was or asked whom it should go to - she acted like she knew. I still had not gotten my margarita on the rocks with salt yet & had to mention that yet again. When I received my Navajo Taco it was 1/2 the size of the order that my friend had received (my original order). Very disappointed. It really had no taste to it. I have traveled threw New Mexico as well as camping on the Havasupai Indian grounds in AZ for several years & always get the fry bread taco when I am there - way more taste & can't get enough of them. This Navajo taco was just blah. The Guacamole was good but the chips were just so so tasting. The Lugumbres was good but not 5 star worthy. Finally when they did bring my margarita out it was missing the salt. At that point I was not going to deal with them anymore in trying to get the order right. Looking around at other patrons who ordered the house margarita they were in 16oz glasses filled to the brim while mine was a mear 10oz. Disappointed all around in service & food. I am paying the same exact price as everyone else but yet I get a smaller drink as well as 1/2 the amt of food that was originally presented. My friend made out well though as she got to eat my original order of the Navajo Taco as well as take her burrito home for a meal the next day.",

The has brown thing was too greasy in its own right. Green Chile had a kick, but eggs could have been cooked more and would have like bottle of sauce option in burrito, not just an actual Creen Chili. Perhaps you need to get it smothered for that effect? Calabicitas on the side was good, not great, but Sopadillas were a nice touch, although I should have eaten them right zway instead of waiting 15 minutes to get home. It's like getting a bagel outside NYC, you just can't recreate that New Mexico cusine outside of the city it was born into.",

I wasn't told until I had already ordered & was sitting at a table waiting for several minutes. It was still early in the day (lunchtime).  I felt like it was a little early to run out of rice - poor planning.  I had ordered a veggie burrito; so, the rice was a significant ingredient for me - very disappointing.  I decided to go ahead & see what it tasted like anyway.  I was encouraged by the flavor of the green chile and the red chile.  Thus, the higher rating.",

We decided to order for takeout and I told the woman bartender that it was our first time at the place.  She wasn't helpful as to toppings, extras, etc.  Frankly, I wanted to leave the parking lot before the women did.  One other customer got her car keys and brought the car to the front door.  Why are they serving customers that appear so intoxicated?  Oh yeah, food was ok but I was totally turned off by the yelling and craziness.",

The inside of the restaurant is pretty sparse, but they do have some decor on the walls and they actually have a small bar at the front. I didn't partake, but I know they at least have beer.  The burritos are huge and stuffed with lots of good stuff. I had chicken, rice, black beans, and....my favorite....some kind of veggie mix. It came with all sorts of interesting vegetables like zucchini, yellow squash, and even artichoke hearts! Yum, totally made the meal. If you're like my husband and hate Chipotle (and the like) because they put rice and beans in your burrito, taking up valuable meat space, then you can get your burrito served \"Carlito's Way\" - double meat, and nothing else inside. Regardless of the style, the burrito is served in a takeout dish covered with your choice of sauce and accoutrements (sour cream, guac, pickled jalapenos, fresh jalapenos, Serrano peppers, etc). I got all the extras and ended up removing as many jalapenos as possible because it was super-spicy.  Note that it costs a little bit more than Chipotle: for our 2 burritos it was $19.",

I'm a huge green Chile fan having been raised in Colorado so I have been searching for a reasonable substitute in las Vegas for years.   the green Chile stew is awesome with an added dash of salt on some occasions but usually very good. my very favorite is a stuffed sopapilla filled with the pork verde and then smothered in green Chile-so good! I can eat two, easy.  burritos are much better than a robertos burrito, especially the breakfast burritos. the fun nights to go in are when something special is cooking, anywhere from pizzas with green Chile to different sandwiches or special cuts of meat, sometimes on the grill out front. the kids are happy eating quesadillas or tacos. mom is happy with a margarita, which are very good by the way.   one of my favorite places to go in las Vegas and Im sure our children grow up with fond memories of eating here the way I remember different foods from my childhood.",

Good tip: don't sit in the middle of the restaurant when the line forms they are right next to you. Place is pretty small.  They have TV's with no sound but at least you can watch, my friend got the a bloody beer which looked & tasted amazing--so get one of those!  She also got some fried dough dessert thing that came w/ honey on the side, get that too!  I ordered a tortilla-less burrito [basically like a burrito salad] w/ the green chili sauce and chicken.  The chicken was pretty gross, lots of tough parts and fat, definitely not all white meat and I didn't think the highest quality I picked it out towards the end.  The black beans were under cooked and more on the 'harder side' then they should've been. I'm from Miami, I know black beans!  I ordered my co-worker chicken nachos to go.  They looked amazing, brought them back to her, she ate them, I asked her what she thought--- she said the chicken was gross too! Thank God I'm not crazy.  So my suggestion here: offer an all white meat vs mystery chicken option, I'd rather pay an extra dollar and get the good stuff.  Undecided if I will return.",

    "text": "A taste of New Mexico in Las Vegas.  My husband and I saw the good yelp reviews so we dragged our four kids out to Carlito's Burritos.  It is not far from the LV strip.  If you like spicy food this is the place. There are also items for those  in your party that do not like spice.  My non spice eater enjoyed the cheese quesadilla.  It is a small casual restaurant located in a strip mall.  You order the food then it is brought to your table.  Everything is served in aluminum containers that look like deep dish plates.  Depending on where you sit it can be a little cramped.  The menu was a little confusing at first, but if you hang in there you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend anything with the green sauce, it was amazing, fresh and zesty.     We ordered the chips and salsa, the chips arrived warm and covered in an amazing chili powder that had great flavor,not to spicy.  They brought out a green and a red salsa with the chips.  Everyone loved the green tomatillo salsa, the red not so much.  I ordered the stuffed fry bread with chicken and smothered in green sauce.  It was very good, although I was expecting the fry bread to actually be crispy, it was more like an enchilada with all the sauce.  Still very good, the chicken was moist and delicious.  My husband had ordered the pork tamale, he ended up liking my item better.  My two son's ordered the cheese enchilada with red sauce.  I really enjoyed eating off their plate, the red sauce was perfect.   Wish they would have had kid sized items.  My daughter (age 7) wanted a bean burrito; plain beans and tortilla.  I ended up paying $5 for a huge burrito that she only ate 1/4.  We ended our meal with everyone getting a sopapilla.  We love this New Mexico dessert and have eaten it at a lot of restaurants over the years.  This is definitely one the best versions we have eaten.  It is a little more doughy than some, but it is not greasy at all.  It is light and fluffy and melts in your mouth.  Smothered in honey, we were all in heaven.  They are large so you could share, but we didn't.  If you are in Las Vegas and want to avoid the craziness of the strip and just want some good food, I would highly recommend.",

It's right near my house so I was hoping for a new hangout..  It was busy when we walked in and smelled great. We ordered frito pie, a green pork tamale, 2 red enchiladas, a side of green stew, a side tossed salad and sopapilla. It took about 25 minutes for our food, and it came out cold. The frito pie was complete mush in the center, like it had been sitting for a few hours, so gross.Why would you make something like that in advance so it is mushy??   The enchiladas were good once you got past the sauce. The red sauce tastes like ketchup with a bit of chiles but you get a whole bunch so I guess that makes up for it. My tamale was really old, I kept trying to cut it and it was just hard all on the outside. I was sad about this, I love tamales, and it was just gross. Also, when I cut into it there was maybe a teaspoon of meat and thats it. My salad dressing was off and really sour. We decided the 20 bucks was worth finding out we didn't like it, threw our food away and went to another place close by for dinner.  The reason for the second star was that the sopapilla (which the girl forgot and I had to go up and ask for, much to her irritation, which I didn't see why she was so irritated, the other girl was doing all the work while she sat behind the counter doing her makeup) was amazing and the green chili stew was ok.   Maybe I caught them on an off day? Maybe I just didn't order the right stuff? Cause if this is authentic New Mexico food, I feel kinda bad for people who grow up on it.",

    "text": "I traveled clear across town to try this place out and my wife and I were disappointed, to say the least.  First off, when you walk in the door, it's very confusing. There's a couple signs when you first walk in and you'll find yourself standing there reading signs to figure out where you need to go next and what to do. The whole time your standing there reading these signs, you'll have employees standing around, looking at you like you're a big inconvenience! So we got to the area where you dine in and I had to ask someone behind the counter if we sit down and the order or if we order at the register and then sit down?? After we got that hammered out, I almost stroked out while looking at their full a la carte menu. They nickel and dime you for every stupid thing there. For instance, a burrito $x.xx, add pork $x.xx, add cheese $x.xx, add whatever! They charged you for every single thing. They even charge for chips and salsa! I'm surprised they didn't charge me $1.25 to walk in the front door! I will say the food was alright. It wasn't horrible but the atmosphere, customer service, the cost and the overall experience sucked! Maybe I'm biased as I'm a regular at Chile Addiction but when I go there, they can't give you enough chips and salsa and guess what. When you order something like a burrito or enchiladas stack, they don't nickel and dime you for each stupid little thing. It just comes with it all. Then they give you as many sopapilla's as your belly can handle! This place needs to have some serious change or they will never have return customers, like myself. I won't be returning there. Instead, I'll hit the other New Mexico style place in the SW part of town. It's so much more for less money.",

Here is a tip get a few tomatoes an onion a Jalepeno throw it on your open wood fire grill char them up and blend with a little salt.. elaborate from here.   You would have amazing salsa. Canned tasting garbage is a disgrace to a place turning out such great bbq.. Pick up your SALSA game,  that is pathetic.   Also bartender never asked for water or beer refill and I was sitting 24 inches away from her the entire meal.  I feel bad giving so little stars to a great place but I will change my review if you step up your SALSA game.  Also I will be back for more tri tip and chicken.  Also I've had the sausage sandwich before which is terrific.",

My biggest problem when eating here is that I cant eat more. The burritos are huge.   The fajitas on fridays are probably the best I've had in Vegas as well.   Now lets talk about the new location.  Awesome!! So much bigger and a great lay out. And on a personal level so much better for me because its like a block from my house.

Green chili, fry bread tacos, etc. The owner is always there and the service is always great. The food is pretty good for the price too. I wish they made their own tortillas. That is my only gripe with their food. I usually get a burrito, but I really enjoy the nachos, Navajo taco, and their burger. Big portions also which is great.  I really wish they made their own tortillas.  If they do make their tortillas they're really just eh. Kinda just a vessel. That's like the missing piece of their burritos. It leads me to get Navajo tacos more often than not. Sometimes the meat can be a little dry, but nothing some green chili sauce can't fix.   Overall, the service and staff takes the place from a 3 to a 4. They have some items that are delicious and some that are just ok. I would definitely check it out and see if that style of food is something for you.",

    "text": "Ok, Let me start with saying that if I could have given them a 3.5, I would have.   I have been a long time customer of Carlitos, and have enjoyed their food.  I've had some trips that were a 5 out of 5, and some that were a 2.  If I ordered the same thing all the time, They would probably get a 5 most of the time...but I like to be adventurous.  There are some things that they do very, very well. Their green chile stew is awesome and hot. If you get anything with green chile, it will be good.  Also, their sopapillas are excellent! Their service can be hit or miss.  In my experience, the people who serve at the take-out counter are wonderful and enthusiastic about serving New Mexican food.  What is not a 5 here?  Unfortunately, their red chile.  It used to be very good, but they have suffered from what I call the Las Vegas Chile Slide..that is where a restaurant starts out with really good red chile but then slowly start adding more flour or other filler until it is almost inedible. It used to remind me of having enchiladas in El Paso and now it is just Meh. The other item I was disappointed in was the chile relleno. I am kind of picky about those.  The batter was too heavy (which would have been ok if there had been outstanding red sauce to sop up) and the chile itself was under-roasted and otherwise lacked flavor. The green chile pork-stuffed sopapilla, however, was outstanding.   Recomendations:  Green Chile Pork-stuffed sopapilla (full size, not the half size...you will be disappointed if you do not get a full serving of this yumminess)  Orders of extra sopapillas to fill with honey for desert  Green Chile enchiladas with the sides of pozole and green chile stew  On a side note, you can also get frozen red chile sauce (not floured down) and frozen blue corn tortillas there, if you are lucky.    Get it all to go and skip the dining room.",

I will have to think twice before returning!  The owner needs to know their employees need supervision!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I really want to support a New Mexican restaurant but the service here is terrible.  Lots of people working but no one seems to want to take your order or bring your bill.  We were literally the only people in the sit down side after two groups finished eating and left.  No one came to take our order. After 20 minutes I went to the cash register on the take outside and ask them I supposed to order here because no one's taking my order? The girl said I'll send somebody right out. The lady that took our order was not a good waitress she got my order wrong but our food came out fast. The chili Verde was really good however I find that their green chili sauce needs more spices and it's runny.  Needs to be a lot thicker.  After waiting around and Only one other table of people eating, we had to go up to the counter again and ask for a ticket so that we could leave. The surface has a lot to be desired a massive downside. So disappointing",

    "text": "I'm torn... 2 stars or 3? 2 1/2 maybe. The only reason I wanted to try this place is because of the New Mexico Mexican flavor. I'm from New Mexico area, Navajoland. I saw Navajo Tacos on their menu and had to see what this imposter is serving. It's like going to a Chinese/Japanese restaurant and you see Mexicans cooking. Is it still authentic Asian cuisine? My thing is, if you're going to call it a Navajo Taco.... Make it like a real Navajo Taco. Or call it something else... A Sopapilla Taco maybe. That's what it was essentially. Aside from the Navajo Taco fail, the stuffed Sopapilla was flavorful. It did have the New Mexico flair. Didn't get to try the  chips and salsa... We did order it but we never got it. We also ordered smothered fries, one of my NM favorites, we didn't get the order too. We had to cancel those two orders since our food came out without it.  Pictures posted: Ground Beef Stuffed Sopapillas. Back in NM, there would be some green chilies and lettuce and tomatoes on top. Their version of a Navajo Taco and what a real Navajo Taco would look like... What I made for dinner one night. I'm taking orders. lol  I might go back.... I'll have to try the Pasole next time and compare that to Chili Addiction's Pasole.",

We came in a little after they opened. Service was so so... the staff was some what friendly, but seemed like they did not want to be there. They were quick to take our drink and food order. Ordered the steak and egg quesadilla, chili verde pork smothered burrito, chips and salsa. Watched the server bring the wrong food to the wrong table and pick up the plates and give it to the right table... not sure if I would like that... but the two tables joked back and forth about the mistake. Cleanliness was not a high priority... they brought out dirty cups to our table that had very obvious and visible caked on food stuck to the side... heard the table next to us complaining about the dirty bathrooms. Food came out pretty quick and looked very appetizing. The steak and egg quesadilla was pretty good... however the chili verde pork burrito was very disappointing. The pork was tough, fatty and not very flavorful... it was hard to cut with a knife... I was looking forward to a good chili verde burrito and this was not it. The chips tasted day old... and salsa pretty basic. Overall it was pretty mediocre... maybe if I was near by I would try it again... but would definitely not go out of my way for a second visit.",

It's one of those burgers with a really but and fat patty and was prepared like it was home cooked, sort of how I wouldn't imagine my mom would make it. And that's probably why I liked it so much. The green Chile was on point. the fries came a bit later.  Swipe left to see it without the top bun.  Would definitely eat this again.   More reviews on instagram - foodingwithbobo",

It was good, the flavor of New Mexico food, which I like.  The fountain soda were of the Coke genre. They also had bottle Mexican soda (the kind with sugar, instead of HFCS). The had Horchata, Jamaica and Orange in the bubbling fountain dispensers.  My coworker had a chicken bowl with salad on it, he said it was good.

It did not look like anything I have seen the Navajo's make. It was not fried to its beautiful crispness. It was like a pillow of soft dough. I wanted some texture contrast to the soft spicy compliment of chili. The service was good and the place was clean. The menu is small and sometimes thats a good thing. I am on the fence on if its worth a trip back. I am more like a 2 1/2 stars. to the owners and chefs check out any You tube video of Navajo taco's and see if I am wrong about what you are selling.",

    "text": "We went to eat here yesterday and as we were ordering we noticed a C rating from SNHD. Now I'm not a horribly fussy person, for the record I have eaten there in the past and enjoyed the food, but the C rating bothered me. I asked the woman who was taking the order about the C rating, she made a face acted very odd and blew me off. I asked again and she rudely told me she had just returned from her days off and knew nothing about it. The C rating really bothered me knowing that a C rating is one step from being closed down, and her sketchy behavior really didn't help the matter so we cancelled our order and left. To the owner I do understand and realize that perhaps inquiring about a rating may be considered rude. However perhaps some customer service training may be in order considering as a regular customer I have seen the woman working the cash register before, she stands out as she has bragged to me and other customers that she's so involved in the restaurant and prominent that people think she's the owner. A simple polite \"I'm not sure would you like to contact the owner or manager\" would have been acceptable. From a customers stand point I made it clear that I had been there before and enjoyed the food at 8 1/2 months obviously pregnant my inquiry was purely concern and not to put the restaurant down. Despite the fact that this is the only place in Las Vegas I can get the New Mexican food I enjoyed eating in my hometown of Santa Fe, the C rating they currently have, the C rating they had last May (according to the SNHD website), their poor customer service, lack of regard for regular customers. I will not return, and have already told several friends (who eat there) about my experience.",

I am a New Mexico boy myself and no one seems to be able to do it outside of New Mexico but this place is really really good I wish I could tell you more about there's I buy ever since I got stuffed sopapillas with meat and cheese I have been legit hooked the only other thing I have had is the dollar tacos on taco Tuesday which is real meat and real cheese and green chile in my case and the green chile and meat at serious serious business!!!!  My only gripe  about here is the line for taking orders is kind of clunky and awkwardly close to people sitting at there tables and squeeze between a soda machine and tables so people are squeezing by and around you which is a bubble issue I guess besides that the cashier is never entirely helpful for those who come for the first time and don't normally have New Mexican food.... But I already know what I want so I'm good lmao  The food really does make up for those awkward though... Long live Carlito's!!!!",

For cheap$$, they will smother anything you order in the green chili if you want, and I always want!  It seemed extra spicy this morning which was perfect, but I could only eat half.  The other half will be in the toaster oven later and will still be delicious.  Sunday is 2 for 1 breakfast burrito's all day. Too early for the $1 beer special, but I have taken advantage of that before as well.   If not a breakfast burrito, then the carne adovada with the calabacitas is my go to burrito... smothered of course.   And when I want to go low carb, they do it in a bowl and it is fantastic.  They usually have a line  but it moves fairly quick and is worth the wait.",

    "text": "Found this place a couple of years ago through groupon and was hopeful, as my family is from New Mexico and I lived there for a while back in high school  I was not disappointed.  The prices are great, the portions large and they serve only Hatch chili!  When I discuss Carlito's with fellow New Mexicans, we agree that this is our hidden gem in Las Vegas for a taste of home.  Although it is a bit cramped and definitely a hole in the wall, the food is always consistantly good and service friendly.  This place is usually busy and definitely cramped.  Even got to eat next to the lovely Dina Titus during a busy Saturday morning.  Obviously, she knows where to get some good grub!  People don't realize the diffierence between Mexican and New Mexican food and it really comes down the chili.  I love both but I can't live without my Hatch chili!  Everything I have had here is super tasty!  Love when they bring the BBQ pit out front and you can get racks of ribs to go at a super reasonable price.  Although everything has been great there, they have the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!  Sorry mom.  I always get the chorizo, smothered christmas tree style! (red and green chili for the novice)  For those who don't like the spicier side of life, they have other great options to satisfy your hunger pangs.  Just don't forget your sopapillas!  They will make your tastebuds so happy, you might forget the spice that just reaked havoc on your tongue!  My opinion--GO!  TO CARLITO'S BURRITOS",

The green chili was spicy but very flavorful. The red wasn't so great.  It tasted powdery. Overall the burrito was big and lots of flavor.  A little dry though.  Will definitely come back to try a different kind.",

This burrito was HUGE and smothered with green chile. I've never had a desire to visit New Mexico but it is now on my list of desired places to visit just from tasting what I've been missing out on. I took two other visits since that first taste and have not been disappointed. I have even ventured off to try their smothered fries with red chile...delicious!! This place is GREAT!!! The staff is extremely friendly, it gives you a feeling of not being in a big city like Vegas anymore but in some kind of small friendly town. The one and ONLY reason for giving Carlito's 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the restaurant itself is so tiny!! My immediate local family could fill that place up easily. A restaurant this delicious and friendly never stays empty so consider that as a warning if you're expecting to for sure have some place to dine in. Ooh and please don't let me forget to mention the $3 tall glass margaritas!!! If beer is your preference, they have that also. What else can you ask for.",

The food is amazing and fast. The environment if very casual and relaxing.  You can order anything from a smothered burrito with green chile, red chile, or Christmas style (both) to stuffed sopapillas and Frito pie.  It has all the great flavors of New Mexico.  The only thing missing form the menu is a green chile burger (can't understand why they don't sell these!)  Everything is great though and prices are cheap.",

To begin with, the place is filthy. Grime cakes almost every surface. The food is perhaps the worst approximation of New Mexican cuisine I have ever encountered. I ordered a chicken burrito, smothered with red and green chile, and was sad to find that the tortillas are not hand made. Also, the chicken inside was dry and rubbery. Any NM restaurant worth it's salt would have slow cooked the meat in red or green chile sauce until it was tender and juicy. The chile sauce was ok, but it was reduced to nothing but a dry crust on top of the dry tortilla.  My daughter's cheese enchilada was much better, but was swimming in a soup-like sauce.  I do have to say that the sopapillas were excellent, however. Very authentic and delicious. That is why I gave 2 stars instead of one.",

Carlitos started on sunset near the airport and was a tiny shop and now they've grown into a full on restaurant with a bar too! Way to go. Now on to the food!! Definitely get the smothered burrito with green sauce:D that sauce has a kick to it but its a good kind of spice. Get the combo with the sopapilla and eat that with honey. My other go to are the steak nachos. I can keep munching on that all day. Side note: you can get both red and green Chile on your burrito or nachos for a just in between kick to your meal. They also have a loyalty program too... which I need to figure out what my points get me lol. They also have cash back on Yelp! So it's a win win, tummy is happy and wallet is happy because I get some cash back!",

The sauce had sort of an olive aftertaste... But that was probably just me.  My taste has been super funky and off lately.  I think due to some medication I was taking.  So I will have to go back before I move.  Plus, I am STILL kicking myself for not getting that fry bread!!!  My friend got the sliders.  So cute!   They were wrapped in little tortillas!  Why didn't I take a pic!  Because I was too busy being fat, that's why.  ** if anyone from Carlito's is reading this:  my friend ( born and bred in NM) did say she wishes there were more green chile in her slider.  I had plenty extra green chile to share from my burrito though.  So, no problem!  They have $3 margaritas!  I know, right??? And they are yummy!     My girlfriend buys roasted  green chile from them during their roasting season.  How awesome is that?  Saves you a trip to NM.    I just have to add something I think is funny... Colorado peeps think the Hatch green chile is their thing.  I have so many friends from Colorado who are heartbroken when they get schooled that it is not.   Go to Carlito's !",

So, I decided to watch and wait... for 10 minutes.  Then the waitress bagged up our food and passed it off to me. I mentioned something to the waitress about the food being under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and she just walked away. I was gonna raise hell but after waiting for 25 minutes I wasn't going to have them remake it because they were so freaking slow in the first place and I don't like the idea of spit in my food.  I drive home, a total of 3 minutes, and found cold, gluey, gross sopapillas with congealed, greasy cheese and a complete lack of green chile. Disgusting!  Never, ever, ever again.",

The chips and guacamole we ordered tasted stale and flavorless and not only did the food take forever, but the server got confused as to who had what within a three table radius. We each ordered a breakfast burrito, his was with everything, mine with bacon. Not bad at all but...the rest of the day we felt like we had rocks in our stomachs and couldn't eat again until late at night because we were nauseous all day and the next. I highly doubt we are going to go back after experiencing that.  **Update** A message from the owner stating he's sorry for not (me) being a fan. I'm okay with the snippy response, yet....Wow, he could have at least apologized for the service. Oh well, won't be going back any time soon, that's for sure.",

You can get medium to super duper hot extreme burn your mouth and skin. They sell them in 15 or 30 lb bags but there's also 1 lb containers inside.   I only come for the food. I do enjoy the flavor of a mild or medium chile but I'm not crazy about the hot stuff. The enchiladas here are one of my favorites, I have to get one red and one green because I can't choose between the two. This last time I tried the a la carte chile rellano and it was amazing! That was even without being smothered, so so delicious. The sopapillas are a lot bigger than other places and so light and yummy. They come with combo meals.   The only reason for four stars is the service can be a little slow and it's not the most comfortable restaurant. It's big and open with hard chairs and tables. It's lacking in some areas and not real inviting. This last time we dined in and they somehow messed it up and brought our order out as to go, so we ate it out of to go containers. They would have plated it, but what's the point when you already brought it out?",

Just a no frills New Mexico style Mexican joint with amazing, fresh, homemade, delicious food. Chill atmosphere with great service!

We met a friend yesterday for lunch and my husband ordered his usual pork verde burrito, I ordered a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco. The young lady who was helping us was kind enough to recommend I order the combo platter which comes with two sides and a sopapilla.   When our order arrived, my husband received the wrong dish, so we had to send back. It wasn't like the place was filled with people, it wasn't so I am not sure why the order was incorrect.  My taco and enchilada were just tasteless. The enchilada sauce was very bland and although the chicken had been grilled, it was just blah. My husband ended up finishing my lunch as I just didn't want to eat anymore. At this point I waited for the sopapilla hoping it would save this meal for me. Well, it never came and I had to go find someone so I could have it. It was finally brought out with some honey but zero pizazz. No powdered sugar just fry bread...  My husband was super disappointed as he really wants me to enjoy this place but unfortunately I have zero desire to return. I am glad he enjoys it but in the future he will have to invite someone else to join him.",

Great food, great prices, great location, and a great staff!!!    Since they have moved to Sunset our experience overall has been dwindling-   from time to time we would have a great experience - but those times are all gone.  The other night we went over to Carlito's, and believe me - it will be the last!  Upon entering the restaurant there was a filthy mop bucket in the middle of the floor...unattended.  We ordered to go.  While we waited someone came for the mop bucket and continued to mop the floors with the cold black water in the disgusting water bucket.    When we got home with our to go order, my \"salad with grilled chicken \" was a greasy corn tortilla with a scant amount of shredded lettuce and a scant amount of black beans and a very scant amount of minced deep fried mystery meat.  VERY DISAPPOINTING! Save yourself for Chili Addiction located where the OLD Carlito's was located on Pecos and Patrick.",

The food was good but the way the restaurant is set up to work and the lack of cleanliness is why I could not give a better review.  My son ordered a smother burrito with the red Chile meat. I ordered the one with the Chile verde inside. They call them different names but that pretty much what it was. The red Chile meat was phenomenal!! The Green Chile wasn't the most flavorful but still good.  We also had ordered the chips and salsa (large) - I would not recommend spending the money. The salsa taste like it came from a jar and it was a small bowl that was not enough for my family of 5.  The set up - the space is a large space - actually a restaurant but the customers go up to a counter, place the order and then someone brings it to your table. Although the food was good, I feel I shouldn't be paying restaurant prices when they are just bringing the food to my table and are never to be seen again.   Also we were there for lunch so the had only been open for a few hours but the floors were dirty and looked liked they had not been mopped for some time. Some of the booths were ripped.   I went to use the restroom and could barely see. I think they are using done sort of energy efficient light bulb or something but it was ridiculous.   Carlito's needs to hire some more staff to check on tables, refill drinks and bus tables. They also need to hire someone to do a nice thorough cleaning. The food was great like I gave said but I'm not sure I would return.",

I would definitely recommend the adovada tacos. I was however not impressed with the green chile, which is what I was really craving.  The chips and salsa were not anything to get excited about, and you have to purchase that separate, so it was a real let down. The chips were cold and hard, instead of warm and fresh, and they didn't come until after my entree was at the table. Overall I was just waiting for that bite that made me say, \"yummm!\"   There is a huge Pepsi machine where you can get yourself refills, so that was cool.",

I've been to numerous places in New Mexico and the cuisine here is on par with the culture and cuisine of New Mexico without all the traveling. The food here is outstanding & so are the portions I never leave this place hungry.  I think my only gripe is, it's a little expensive not over the top or anything but a decent meal will easily cost you close to $15.00 with a drink.  A great place to dine & experience the AMAZING & ADDICTIVE HATCH CHILI!",

The women's bathroom has graffiti scratched on the mirror, the handicapped stall was out of paper toilet seat protectors and the paper towel dispenser are broken with the rolls just sitting on the broken dispenser. On my last visit the women's bathroom was filthy. Obviously the owner does not spend any money on maintenance.  The server did not seem to understand that we wanted a single stuffed sopapilla and asked repeatedly if we wanted the platter without explaining this was more. The ruffed sopapilla has changed, before it was smothered with Red Chile and was delicious. Tonight hardly any red Chile and dry.  None of the tables were bussed after the patrons left and more than half the tables still had food/honey/ detritus stuck to the top.  Sorry Carlito's you lost my business.",

This was my first visit and I sat at the bar watching them prepare my burrito, not sure what had happened but the guy made some sort of mistake making my burrito, so he took the whole burrito apart and threw away the tortilla in the trash and then took another tortilla to put the same filling from the other burrito, the done product burrito was a size at Roberto's!    I read and heard a lot of good things about Carlito's Burrito and gave it a try today. What a disappointment and for the price they charge it was an awful experience. Absolutely a disaster is that the way you make a burrito and charge people $9.03.    I guess after a while any good place goes down the drain if you don't keep up the quality and good service.  Unhappy customer!  Response to Dave,  Dave,  My first experience paying exorbitant price for a burrito that was mediocre is unacceptable. Every unsatisfactory comment I read on Yelp about Carlito's Burrito, you tend to justify your errors. I have no objections giving you a second chance if you can spot me and others on Yelp on our next trip! Money unfortunately does not grow on a tree for us to fill your pocket.   When I pay plush price for a burrito, I do not want to hear about your process all I expect is quality food serviced, which was utterly not the case in my experience.  Here is what you need to comprehend; stop making excuses for serving dissatisfactory food instead find solution to not have a customer leave your restaurant unhappy.",

Came here to use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, and it turns out they stopped accepting the certificates last week, however they let me use mine this time.    The food is very reasonably priced, until you get the upcharge for the rice, beans and sopapilla, which is not worth $3.  I would recommend not doing the upcharge.  The sopapilla is very good and I loved it, but I don't know if its worth the charge.  The food itself is good.  I had one chicken and pork tamale smothered in green sauce.  The green sauce was very spicy and good.  I normally am not crazy about chicken tamales but I liked this one much better than the pork.  My husband got cheese quesadillas (they were just ok, but good when I dipped into my green sauce), and a chicken burrito smothered in a weird tasting red sauce that my husband liked but I did not.  Some weird flavors in it that I was not familiar with.  Is this a New Mexico thing?  I'm not sure.  Now this is the kicker as to why I'm not sure how to rate this place.  We both had severe stomach problems after this meal.  I had a huge stomach ache later that night to the point to where I just about threw up, and my husband was permanently stuck in the bathroom.  So, we enjoyed our meal but I guess but our bodies didn't.  So we (obviously) will not be going back here again.",

We were unsure where to go, surprise, surprise! Driving down Pecos, discussing options, I asked the wife if she was feeling adventurous, to which she said yes.   A quick right turn lead us straight to Carlito's Burrito's. We were not quite sure what to expect as we walked up to the burrito place next to a bakery and tattoo shop. Upon opening the door, we were greeted by delicious aromas and a full establishment, with patron's aluminum food container tray items generously filled with oversized, drenched burritos.  Shuffling between the chairs and soda fountain, we made our way to the counter to order, leaning back to stair at the big screen tv menus mounted near the ceiling, our meal choices formed within our minds quite quickly.  A soft spoken, but courteous and polite gentleman took our order, answered our questions and efficiently handed our drink cups to us. Shuffling back toward the soda fountain, we filled our cups with carbonated, sugary drinks and sat down at a freshly vacated table.   They were so busy, the staff could not get to an empty table to wipe it down before it was re-occupied. Heck, the vacating customers couldn't all be out of their seats before the next patrons were sitting down!   While having a brief discussion about the artwork on the walls and how busy the restaurant was, the soft spoken man brought out our meals with an inquiry as to anything else we needed, or he could do for us. With tongues eager to taste the delicious smelling food before us, they spoke of their own volition and assured him we were ready to eat.  I had chicken enchiladas in red sauce with rice, she had a bowl containing the innards of a dissected burrito.  The red sauce has some bite to it, but not too much to obliterate the flavor and essence of the chiles that lived up to their purpose of being a part of a great sauce. The chicken bits were succulent and tender, not a hint of overcooked dryness was detected.  I am guessing her food was equally as delicious, as we finished our meals in near silence, aside from comments about how good the food was, and asking why we waited so long to eat there.  This was our first, but definitely not our last visit. I am anxious to get a chance to try some of their happy hour specials, and sample more of the menu!",

    "text": "Last Saturday, my family split in two. Kinda.  I took our daughter to Disney on Ice (Princess edition) & my husband took our son rock climbing. They ended up at Nevada climbing centers so after the sweet princess show was over, we met them at NCC. We contemplated for a whole 2 minutes what to eat when Carlito's Burritos popped up on my nearby restaurants! I've had this place bookmarked for a couple of weeks and was super excited to be close.  We get into Carlitos. It is small, yet cozy. The walls are painted bright and there are pictures and decor everywhere. The lady who took our order was SO sweet. She kept complimenting my children and was very thorough when taking our order considering it was our first time. I ended up getting the chicken nachos with green chilli and jalapenos on the side where my husband got the spicy pork smothered in green chilli and cheese. Our food came out shortly after and we dug in. I shared my nachos with my kids because they were so large, but as soon as the food was brought to us, and I touched the top layer of cheese, I noticed it was cold....  As I begin spooning out portions of nachos to my children, I notice that the cheese underneath the top broiled layer wasn't melted. My son who usually has the appetite of a teenager, especially for nachos, didn't want to finish his share and neither did my daughter (although she's pretty unreliable when it comes to eating anyway). I still ate my cold nachos because I felt bad after taking so much out of it, to be sending it back. I should have stopped when my stomach was telling me that it wasn't jiving. On the other hand, my husband's burrito was DELICIOUS. It was so warm and smothered that it made me resent my nachos even more. Every bite of his cozy burrito made my nachos seem even colder. The green chilli isn't too spicy, but it sure is tasty!! In the end, I wasn't able to finish my nachos, even when sharing with my children. I can easily finish a tray of Roberto's nachos single handedly, and then some, just to give you an idea of the size.   Later that night and the next day, my stomach wasn't the same. It churned all night and was the saddest tummy ever. I really really hope the chicken was fully cooked before it was thrown into the broiler to not get warm at all, but I'm not certain.... Sadly, because of this experience, I won't be back. My stomach will never forgive me if I return.",

He said this not like the Carlito hatch green chili and I see no reason to bother with the drive again. It is as if someone bought the name and menu but not the recipes. Such a disappointment.

    "text": "I'm a born and raised New Mexican living in SoCal and every time im in Vegas I need to get my chile fix. Carlitos has always been THE (only) spot west of Gallup to get good NM cuisine. I LOVED this place at the old location, and today tried the new one. I desperately want to give this place 4 stars (back in the day it was 4 or 5 stars easily), but it seems they changed the menu and portion sizes of some items. Now they come in \"half\" or \"full\" portions, the half portion being the size of a regular one at the old location. So I ordered a bean stuffed sopapilla to go, not knowing about the changes, I was charged almost $13 for the sopapilla as the woman taking the order never mentioned there was an option for half of full. I only wanted the half (normal sized) portion. That's fine, I guess. So I got a plate with two stuffed sopas. It was pretty good- But it seems as though the food is a lot less authentic, along with the new decor. The green chile looked almost like a pale green salsa, no meaty bits of green in there at all, and it lacked heat. The red chile was ok, but not the same. It seems like they stopped using Bueno chile in their food and went for something cheaper. Also, they started adding cilantro to the onions they garnish the plates with. I asked for extra onions on mine and also got a ton of cilantro. That's Mexican, not New Mexican, and it made my food taste, well, not like the home cooking I'm used to from this place. Despite everything, my biggest gripe was the lack of ambience. The old location was full of paintings , Lobos gear, and other distinctly New Mexican decor. Now it looks pretty, well...bland. I miss the old Carlitos. I feel bad writing this because I love supporting great local places, especially my home team, but if you are looking for the same Carlitos, be forewarned.",

    "text": "I realized a long time ago that Mexican food is generally 5 basic ingredients re-arranged in different ways. Beans, Cheese, Meat, Tortilla, Salsa, Sauce, sometimes rice. And while Carlito's is no exception to my keen observation, they do some great re-arranging.   Tucked away in the south east, Carlitos is probably the only thing keeping this small strip mall in business. The place itself is pretty tiny, and probably can't seat more than 25 people. Yet despite its small size and odd location, the place is usually packed by regulars who are familiar with the food and know what they want.  Carlitos offers traditional fare such as burritos, tacos, nachos and the like. But they throw in some new things to the mix, the sliders (mexican style mini burgers wrapped in tortillas with a chilli relish), green chili stew (super spicy), and the sopapillas (which are essentially fryed fluffy tortillas which they use for a dessert or stuff them for bigger meals)  The food is great for the price. Getting a full meal with a drink is easy under $10, and on top of that they have $1 draft beers (they have their own brew I guess) The tacos are made fresh which deep fryed tortillas made on the spot, and the sopapillas make great fluffy desserts. I thought the huge burrito I ordered was a little on the bland side. Each week day they have specials going on, the best is probably $1 taco tuesdays. Just remember that the place gets packed. Tell your friends to grab a seat or get it to go. Definitely worth checking out if your into Mexican food and tired of your regular places.",

The price is very reasonable too. The staff behind the bar was friendly and it looks like they had some mixed drinks and beer available. The reason for the 4 and not 5 is the size of the place.

    "text": "Many have waxed poetic about the splendor of burritos.   Statues have been erected in their honor as a token of appreciation to their flexibility of ingredients, their filling nature, and, of course, their deliciousness.  Wait, there aren't really burrito statues across the world?  We should get on that.  As a result of the existence of this amazing food invention, you trek to your local Chipotle once a week for lunch and gorge yourself silly while pointing and laughing at those across the street at Taco Bell.  Well what if I told you that there existed a place in Las Vegas that went above and beyond what you get when you visit Chipotle, Robertos, or heaven forbid Taco Bell for your burrito needs?  THIS IS THE BEST BURRITO IN LAS VEGAS   Full disclosure:  there are probably 120 other burritos I have yet to try here, but I'm not above hyperbole for my reviews.  Yes, the place is way too small and seats are way too closely spaced for their own good.   We sat in the last table for 4 available on a Friday evening and I had to eat my entire meal as if I were in a straitjacket.   I didn't care.   I ordered a Pork Verde Carlito's Burrito smothered with Green Chile and some Jalapenos on top.   You know that cliche from movies and TV shows where people eat something delicious and are constantly going \"Mmmmm\" and exclaiming how good what they're eating is?   I became that cliche.  The pork was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the flavor of the green chile smothering it will make it hard for me to ever eat another dry burrito again.   This is not a small portion either.  For $7.25 I thought the amount of amazing burrito I received was worth it's weight in gold.   Here's the kicker:  I was still hungry afterwards.   Not hungry in the sense of \"that 3 lbs of pork and chile and tortilla has left my stomach empty\", but hungry in the \"I want to eat every single thing on this menu right now\"    Everyone at my table seemed happy, though my friend who got the Frito Pie may have exploded before he made it home as none of us have ever heard from him again (kidding)  For drinks we got some margaritas to start which I found to be very weak.  Very syrupy and not enough tequila for my liking, but for $3.00 I kind of expected that.   Then I braved a Michelada because I'd never had one before and I'll try anything once.   Never again, but I was glad I tried it.   On my third choice I settled for Modelo on draft and like Goldilocks, it was juuuuust right.    Cramped, too crowded, too chaotic, bad margaritas?   Check, check, check, check.   5 stars just for the burrito?   Yup.   Let the first burrito statue we erect in Vegas bear the name of Carlos.",

Then a friend of mine who moved here from Cruces shortly before I did told me about Carlito's. Of course I had to check it out.   I must say that Carlito's does a fabulous job of bringing a little slice of home (New Mexico) to Vegas. Everything that I've tried I've enjoyed, but I'm a die hard enchiladas fan. And I eat them like a New Mexican - stacked and with sour cream. The sopapillas are always hot & always delicious. One day I will have to check out the margaritas and report back on them as well.   If you like to cook with chiles, I would suggest getting on their mailing list or liking them on Facebook so that you are in the loop for when the Hatch chiles will be arriving.",

I've spent a lot of time in New Mexico and have never been able to find an establishment outside of the Land of Enchantment offering fare equally fresh & unique.  Low & behold, Carlito's is here to save the day!  I no longer have to drive 8 hours to find a place that knows what \"Christmas tree\" really means.  I no longer have to get on a plane to find an Indian Taco or Tortilla Burger.  I can get my fix on Route 66 right here in Vegas!  If you're expecting Taco Bell \"Mexican food\" go home.

    "text": "Update because I have an obsession with Carlito's Burritos now.   Since having Carlito's many moons ago I have since been back quite a few times regularly, at least once a week, maybe missing a week in between a few times. But this has definitely become a go-to establishment for me now. I must admit, I think it had replaced my Chipotle cravings! Chipotle is completely different from this place though.  First off always get the calabacitas in whatever you order, if you don't then you might as well go somewhere else - they are the point of this place. The green/red chili sauces are also phenomenal, but the calabacitas are what you come here for. I always get them in my burritos (my natural go-to). I have had the steak (tender, often charred just a bit), the chicken, and of course, the best, the adovada pork.   You have the option to get your burrito smothered, which I have done once, but never again. It is not my thing, but others may like this option. The green chili sauce has a KICK and the red is pleasantly spicy.   The service is always good and the employees are nice. The place is small, so be prepared to wiggle through tables and possibly not be able to eat in the restaurant if it's packed. I suggest eating at the small bar area if you are alone or only with another person. This way you get to watch the cooks because the kitchen is completely open and you can see everything getting cooked and served up.  This is awesome New Mexican cuisine. Don't miss out on this place.",

    "text": "We went and tried out the new location - taking some new folks with us after raving about Carlitos.  I'm sad to say, we were let down :(  I miss the old restaurant and family atmosphere.  I ordered what I normally order, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and the enchiladas were baked on to the bottom of the new pans they use (they used to be in aluminum to go containers that were  deeper and filled to the brim with goodness), there wasn't enough sauce (it's like the didn't adjust their portions to the new pans) and it was just plain dry all around.   It also felt like a smaller portion, but maybe it was just the larger pan, I don't know.  The service kind of sucked too.  The bartender had to ring us up and he was nice, but had no idea what was going on.  The girl next to him (that was on the other cash register), knew how to help him but  would huff and roll her eyes every time he asked her something.  She saw I had a squirmy toddler, but it didn't occur to her that it would be nice if she would help the poor guy out and get my order quicker.  She should realize that her attitude to him transferred on to our general service experience.  It's like she was rolling her eyes directly at me. It made me want to punch the wall, honestly.  The space is large, cold and oddly laid out.  They should just merge both take out and restaurant sides - it's confusing otherwise and they can use the staff on both sides to help.  I really hope it's better next time we go because this is the only decent place for NM food and I can't help but crave a sopapilla every now and then.  Please fix it and bring back the old vibes and food!!!",

    "text": "I came here with my brother because I had a coupon that was about to expire. The place is pretty small, but there are lots of places to sit. My brother ordered a pork combo burrito ($5.75) and a pint of beer ($1). I ordered a chicken ensalada ($6.95). The burrito came wrapped in foil. It was so huge it looked like it was going to explode in my brother's face. He took his first bite and said, \"*%#! yeah, this is dank!\" Translated into normal English, that means it was delicious. He was also very pleased about being able to get a pint of beer for a buck. That's a pretty sweet deal and I think it's all day everyday. My ensalada wasn't what I expected. I was expecting it to be a salad in a tostada BOWL, but it was actually a big salad on top of a flat tostada in a foil bowl. All the juices of the huge salad made the little tostada all soggy on the bottom, so I didn't eat it. The salad itself was good though, I was just expecting to get it in a crunchy tostada bowl that I could tear apart and turn into chips. Even though I wasn't too fond of my salad, I am still a fan of this place. My brother loved his burrito, they have lots of specials, and the prices are cheap!  Tips: *Monday night sliders - $1 Santa Fe sliders 4-9pm *Taco Tues - $1 beef tacos 4-9pm *Wed - 1/2 price breakfast burritos til 11am. $6 Roadrunner pizza 4-9pm *Thurs - $6.50 bottomless bowl of green chile stew 4-9pm *Fajita Friday - %6 chicken, $7 steak, $8 shrimp fajitas 4-9pm *Sat rib night - $8.95 Red Chile Pork Ribs Adovada w/ green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and Calabacitas Sunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day long *Carlito's Special Lager $1",

As my husband is Native American whose family comes from New Mexico, he grew up eating NM food, which is different than Mexican food. But people don't understand that & give this place bad reviews because of their own ignorance.   Anyway, the green chile is amazing. Haven't tried the red yet. Food was great, and there was a lot of it. My only gripe is that the fry bread & sopaipillas weren't 'all that.' My husband's grandmother knocks it out when she makes us fry bread! Comparing the food to what we had when we visited NM, it's very, very good. Santa Fe wins by mere inches though.   They even have New Mexico chilis for sale! Connect with them on Facebook and they will post when the chilis come in and when they are roasting chilis.",

I usually order ahead (give each my number for the discount) & wait in the long line to pick up. Could benefit if there was a pick-up and order lines, but again....LIMITED SPACE. Everything I've had has been great with plenty of flavor. Sopapillas with the honey...great sweet snack. Pork Verde (Carlitos Burrito) & smothered is the way to do it!!! Share or make it lunch and dinner!!! Breakfast burritos are great as well. Give yourself some time, and go!",

Turn it up a notch with green chili.  If you are a total wuss bag, don't get the chili, and go back to New York City.    My personal favorites here are the breakfast burritos (served all day!!!).  The hash-browns within are always crispy, a feat I will never understand.  Add some carne adovada (pork marinated in red chili) with eggs and cheddar, and your taste buds will salsa dance the rest of the day (or into the night).  For spicier flair, try a pork verde (green chili marinated pork) with extra green chilis.    I do not suggest getting it \"smothered\", which is adding even more chilis to the outside, and cheddar.  It is just too much.  Keep the chilis in the burrito, and everything will be just fine.",

Strangely, when I asked, they didn't have any hot sauce available.  I didn't like the fact that the plate on which the food was served was an aluminum take-out container - with no place to recycle it in-store. Incredibly wasteful, and not eco-friendly.

While the place is nicer the service is horrible, the front register staff didn't know what any of the items were and also very slow and behaved like her job was taking away from her FB time. Then when we went to sit down there were 14 tables that were dirty which left no place to sit to eat. 30 min of being there and I finally ask the owner if they can clear some tables and he responded with ya I'll get there. Then 3 more min pass and I clear a table and go ask for a towel to wipe it and he again responded with a smug attitude \"I said I'll be there and said were short staffed\" sarcastically.... I NOW have had enough,...so I said I see, and obviously not well managed either.. As he continued to fill a pitcher, I walked back to the table I had cleared. He came out from behind the counter and removed some other items from one of the 14 tables that had been dirty, but not the one we were waiting at,  and I said WOW unbelievable and he came up and wiped our table and said I can give your money back!!! So I told him that would be great.. I followed him to the register and asked to speak with the manager he replied I'm the owner. So I informed his is leadership skills for a restaurant were horrible and by seeing how he behaved like a child really explained why his staff behaves the way he leads.... So needless to say Carlitio's owner, please take a leadership class and maybe even a hospitality course wouldn't hurt, so hopefully you can learn to lead in a posite and productive manner instead of a jack ass manner....",

    "text": "Maybe New Mexican food just isn't my thing but I don't see how anyone could enjoy it.    I went into Carlito's optimistically, as the aroma of delicious food was seeping outside into the parking lot.  I ordered a chicken Carlito's burrito with green chili sauce, no tortilla, no cheese, and plenty of delicious fixings.    When I arrived back to my office, I was disappointed to see that oil had seeped out of the container into the bag- gross- but to be expected with Mexican food.  Unfortunately, although plenty of oil had spilled out the the carton, there was still a ton in the container.  It was a soupy grease disaster.  Regardless of me ordering no cheese it was covered, which only added to the grease factor.    Despite the look of the food I pressed on and with each bite I was more and more disgusted.  The chicken was poor quality.  It was fatty and had excess cartilage.  I could barely taste the green chili sauce through all the oil.  It was so bad I threw it away after a few bites.    It looked NOTHING like the photos online and was genuinely disgusting.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back.",

The offerings at Carlito's seemed similar to a classy Roberto's with a few pleasing twists (calabacitas, fried egg on enchiladas, green chili sauce, etc).  I went with a wet combo green chili pork burrito with all the free fixins inside. I was warned it would be spicy-- it was. I like heat and it was a perfect amount. I enjoyed the pork meat, too. I also got the $3 sides and sopapilla option. The bread was not my style (greasy and doughy) and my two sides were just alright (posole and chili). I love hominy so I fished out the pieces in the posole and enjoyed those. I would not do the upgrade to my meal again since I hardly ate any of it.  Overall, 4 stars. My burrito was enormous and tasty.",

    "text": "So where else do you go in the valley for frybread? New Mexican cuisine is very different from regional mexican or tex-mex or Peruvian, etc. and if you're a fan of the other side of Arizona then Carlito's does an admirable job.  Yes, you have to go to New Mexico at this point to find the award winners but what other choices do we have? I think Carlito's beats where there ain't any. I hope others get the idea; every time I've been there's a crowd.  I had the Navajo Taco which probably needs adjustment but the green pork  burrito (wet) with lettuce, tomato and cilantro on top of it all really made me happy happy. Oh yeah, don't forget the calabacitas inside for your good health.  There's nothing to say about sopapillas - if you haven't had one or two then oh well. But if you know what a churro is then you better get going. Now.  So Carlito's is beyond okay 'cause everyone I've taken along so far really likes it/them.",

This is a small little counter service restaurant that has seating for maybe 30 people.  It looked like they get a lot of to go orders though.   A friend of mine who lived in New Mexico 30 years goes here quite frequently and mentioned I should go try it with him.  Well, I love me a good pork burrito with verde sauce and that's exactly what I had. I ordered the Carlito's Burrito Double Meat (no beans) with pork verde. When I ordered, I was warned about the heat level... no problem though... That was buy far the best Chile verde sauce I have ever had and my burrito was drowning in it, which is just the way I like it.  The pork was cooked perfectly.  I was amazed I was able to finish the whole think, but I pretty much didn't eat until the next day.  The staff there are very friendly and it is run like a family business. They seem to have a lot of Latino clientele which to me is a good sign and a testament to the food.",

The front door leads to the Take Out counter, so if you want to eat in you go to the bar and order. Did not help that the guy behind the bar was minimally attentive.  The food was OK. Can't say much more than that. We had chips and guacamole - the chips were a bit hard, and the guacamole was really plain. My wife had the shrimp bowl (medium size). The shrimp was fine, but the other ingredients (mostly lettuce) were pretty paltry. I had the chile rellenos which had good flavor, but the portion was small. For about $9 they should consider adding some rice and beans to the dish to round it out some.  It's not that anything was bad...but if I'm going to spend my money eating out, you gotta go beyond what this place offered us today.",

    "text": "My husband and I absolutely love this place! It's really hard to find a place that has good green chili and this place I believe is the best in Vegas!   On Tuesday they have taco taco Tuesday and tacos are only a dollar. Not to mention the tacos are delicious.  I typically order the smothered green chili combo burrito with calibacitas. Their margaritas are good here they are 3.00 I also like to order the chips and guacamole which also comes with green and red salsa (green being my favorite). The carne Asada fries are delicious too and will definitely feed two people. Every time I'm here it's busy which is a good thing in my opinion it means the food is good. The good thing is that the staff is friendly and they are quick to serve. My only complaint is they need a bigger place! If u want that New Mexican flavor this is the place to go",

    "text": "Pop Quiz  Why did the gurlpren and I decide to eat at Carlito's Burritos? A)  We were starving and looking for something close B)  Because Alicia R (aka Yes) said this place was good and we had to try them C)  We haven't had Mexican food in a while D)  Most of our Yelp friends gave them solid reviews E)  All of the above.  If you answered E, you're the 2nd smartest Yelper I know.    Carlito's is located on the southeast side of town and I have to admit, I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food out here in the valley. Coming from San Diego, I never thought anyone out here would come close. Carlito's has changed my mind really quick.  But let me get one thing out of the way first.  When you drive up to this place, you see their sign that reads \"Carlito's Burritos, New Mexican Restaurant\".  That doesn't mean that this is a new establishment that serves Mexican food. It means that this is a restaurant that serves Mexican food from New Mexico.  Hah...I was one of those fools that misread their sign.   Read the reviews, it's all about their burritos and tacos. But for me, it's all about their sopapillas, which is fry bread stuffed with chicken, shrimp, pork, or steak. Being the meat lover I am, I chose steak.  First impression...Man, this is a lot of food. I estimate around 8 oz of well prepared, well seasoned meat, stuffed into the fluffiest fry bread that I ever had. Top it off, it was literally topped off when red sauce. My meal was huge, but so good that my belly wouldn't allow me to quit until it was all gone.  Long story semi-long, try their sopapillas.  You won't be disappointed.   Price is about average for most of their items. But the tacos and enchiladas are a steal of a price.  Big plus for service here. You get it with a smile, some convo, and of course, good food.   PS: I also tried their chicken tamale and thought it was just okay. But that's just me.",

This is not Mexican, nor TexMex, but pure Southwestern as defined by New Mexico.  Red and green chilie sauce, made from Hatch, NM, chilies, are excellent,  but the red is too wimpy, and needs to be heated up.  Soapapillas are heaven when served fresh from the kitchen and dosed liberally with honey.  Excellent lunch or dinner place for sure.",

I should have said something but  everything looked so good I let it slide.  A few other points...  First off the staff was extremely nice.  Told the lady it was my first time there and to recommend and she was happy to accommodate.  Second dollar drafts!   All the time.  Third Daily Specials.!  Fourth frequent diner card!  Appreciation for repeat customers... nice  If you come across this post and consider eating here you will not be disappointed..",

I've only been once since they moved, but it's not because the quality has suffered but rather that the prices went up. Tacos are no longer $1 on tuesdays :( I understand that moving to the new location probably cost a lot of money so raising the prices was probably necessary. And I will certainly go back eventually.  It's just that I'm on a budget right now and since extreme value is what attracted me to this place and its changed a bit it's just not really on my radar right now.  However based on taste alone this place is in credible. Their sauces are so good. I've actually only had their vegetarian tacos and those were so so good! I got them loaded with refried beans black beans squash rice and all the fixings.  I will definitely go try other items eventually",

    "text": "Hadn't been to the new location yet, so I thought I might take the family to what we remember as excellent True New Mexican food. To our surprise, the food was SO much better when they were in the smaller location. Apparently the carne adovada is no longer cooked in the red chile and more to being mass cooked plain and then having your red or green chile sauce poured over it. Both the red and the green chile sauce were so watered down that anyone in or from New Mexico would be ashamed. (I am and was) My wife's burrito bowl was more like a soup, my stuffed sopapilla turned into a doughy mess, and the carne adovada was so fatty that I just couldn't eat it. We also couldn't understand why no one before us had mentioned to the staff that the soda machine was out of carbonation. I heard rumors some time ago that they were giving BBQ a try, but the only remnants of any BBQ was a old beat up charcoal grill in the middle of the dining area. For the size of the new restaurant, one would think that servers could wait on you, but people are still shoved into a cattle line that blocks anyone from easily making it to the dining area to get a seat. It is a very confusing layout. To bad that the growth in size and failed attempt in BBQ resulted in the downward spiral of the food quality. In our experience, the next thing to cut off for savings is the real honey.",

Though I only ordered Sopapilla, I'd say, I will be back to try other food on the menu! Spicy food people should really come here. Plus, I love that they have Coca Cola!!",

Cheap beer and margaritas served here Overall the portion sizes are very generous Prices are very good for what you get on the food as well  Cons- Place is filthy and as the years go by a lack in pride of ownership is starting to show Very cramped with a poor layout. Its always uncomfortable to navigate your way past diners and ppl getting self serve fountain drinks as you make your way back to order. They need to rearrange that place because when busy its a nightmare to dine in Food quality has dimisnished in my opinion over the last 3 years.",

    "text": "Best taco Tuesday in Las Vegas.  Awesome grilled chicken burritos with green chile sauce. I definitely recommend trying this place out if you haven't had a chance.  The new location is much nicer than the old one, and has a lot more room to sit and eat.  The only issue I have, is that they are still operating like they are in their old location.  This can be confusing to customers, as it is a walk up and order, not sit down and order, type of a restaurant.  I think they could dramatically increase their dinner business by hiring a few GOOD servers to wait tables.   C'mon owners, you've done the hard part, expanding your business, don't fall into the common pitfall that causes most restaurants to fail.  Spend a bunch of money expanding, cut back on food quality and service to try and save some money to pay that new big mortgage, then end up closing the doors a year later because you lost what made you good in the first place.  You must have good quality control and service in place, and take time to build your customer base.  Be aware of food costs and operating expenses, but never, ever, sacrifice food quality or service.  It's a tough business, much respect and thanks for bringing New Mexico food to Henderson, please stay around a long time!",

It also comes with a sopapilla on the side,  we couldn't even finish the food we took it home. The staff was very friendly. I wanted to kiss the cook for doing a amazing job.

    "text": "From the moment you enter this, small seemingly \"hole in the wall\" place, your olfactory senses will launch into overdrive.  Carlito's Burritos smells just as good as it tastes - a rare feat in many Las Vegas restaurants I've visited.    The food at their current location (Pecos and Patrick - note: they are moving soon to Sunset and Athenian Dr.) is delicious.  On my first visit I ordered, I guess their signature dish - the Carlito's Burrito, a massive flour tortilla stuffed with pork verde smothered in green chili (I topped it with guacamole and serrano peppers).  I also ordered a sampling of their Green Chile Stew which frankly they should bottle up and sell in mass.  More stew news in a bit.    The Carlito's Burrito with pork verde was an explosion of flavor.  Imagine a huge flour tortilla stuffed with tender pork verde smothered with an amazing green chile sauce.  They skimped a bit on the guacamole and the serrano peppers where thrown in as a second thought.  I say, I say, just take a little care and slice your serrano peppers a little more thinly as most don't like large chunks of hot peppers.      A few days later I ordered dinner for the family tackling their stuffed sopapilla, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales.  Besides the tamale the sopapilla, tacos, and enchiladas were met with high praise and thankful taste buds.  The tamale!  Ugh!  It looked burnt, stale, old/ancient.  It didn't last past a bite.  Everything else was devoured.    BREAKING STEW NEWS: My wife doesn't like spice.  She often frowns on many of the foods I bring home (or cook) as I often add too much spice for her liking.  On both of my visits to Carlito's Burritos I ordered their (what should be their signature dish) Green Chile Stew.  I told my wife, \"this is spicy but so delicious!\"  She ate it and ate it all.  She agreed that even though it was spicy she just couldn't stop as the flavors wouldn't allow her to.  I say this again, bottle this stuff up!  I'd buy this by the gallons (which they do allow via their catering menu!)  I'm so glad a co-worker introduced me to this place and even happier that I introduced my family to this place.  As I noted earlier they are moving.  Thankfully they are moving not far from their current location and are even opening a new BBQ place to boot too.  It is nice they have a membership diner plan that gives you discounts on future visits as I'm bound to rack the points up at this delicious place.",

Most notably for me was the chili relleno's.  I have long been a fan of chili relleno's and am thoroughly impressed with the Carlitos version.  Unlike traditional chili relleno's I have experienced here in Vegas these are deep fried to a crispy crust and are not served with sauce unless ordered (with either red or green).  The honesty of the chili is highlighted by simplicity of this dish.  If your looking for bold chili flavors you will be happy with Carlitos.",

It was yummy and fulfilling for a small size. I can only imagine the large size is enough for two or three people. The fries were baked judging from the texture since it was not crispy and that made the toppings blend well with each bite of it.

However, every single time I come here they mess up the order. Both dine in and to go. Every. Single. Time.   Most recently. five of us went to dinner. Every single order was wrong. Today we went for breakfast burritos. Even though they were labeled correctly, both of them were completely wrong. I'll eat anything, but my wife has food allergies. It sucks because we live so far away and don't want to waste another 45 minutes. I'm from New Mexico and really there isn't any other restaurant that is as good of food as Carlito's and it is going to be a long time before I consider returning.",

I normally have a breakfast burrito, but ventured outside my taste bud comfort zone today to have the \"Stuffed Sopapilla.\"  Smothered in hatch green chile sauce with melted cheese and filled with chile verde with a hefty helping of rice and beans, it was certainly nap time after that.  So many places get chile verde wrong. Whether the meat is too tough, or the flavor isn't right, this place nails it!  I love the new location as well.  I also want to deliver a shoutout to the chips with salsa and guacamole prior to the arrival of lunch heaven.....thanks Carlitos for exceeding expectation every time.",

There was nothing special about it, but it was a good generic drink. I had the carne adovada platter. It was a little on the spicy side, but quite tasty. My husband had a burrito which was nothing special, but good. The style of Mexican food here is New Mexican cuisine. It isn't my absolute favorite, but I like it. Overall, the experience was good and I'll return. This wasn't my first time there.",

I was excited as well since I learned to appreciate the Hatch chile on visits to New Mexico.  This little restaurant is packed pretty much all the time which isn't shocking if you've had the food. The people that work here start to remember you and that is refreshing in an anonymous town like Las Vegas. One Saturday I arrived after the rib special was sold out and the woman working here remembered me the next week and made sure I got one of the specials.  The food is the real attraction though. My favorite thing here is the Saturday night special which is Red Chile Adovada ribs with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas. I love to pair this with the $3 margarita. Seriously, the margarita is $3 and it packs some punch. We also love the Frito Pie which is big enough for two. If you're familiar with Green Chile Stew then you should try it here because it won't disappoint. It packs the heat that Green Chile Stew should have.",

    "text": "Came in Saturday for a breakfast burrito. They have never steered us wrong. We were excited to try out the new location. The previous location was very tight and not very enjoyable. This location in comparison is huge! They even have a full bar!  You enter into the lobby, and can order/pick up takeout from here. You can also enter the dining area off to the right. You place your order at the bar, and the kitchen is directly behind this. There are a lot of tables, and many windows.   We split a bacon and chorizo breakfast burrito that was smothered in green chile. They were great and split it for us. The burrito itself was a disappointment. There were a lot of eggs, too many.  Not so much of the meat either. The bacon was limp. The chorizo was beef, and not too flavorful. It was not bad, but it was hard to find any in the burrito. The little bit of hashbrowns in there was done perfectly though. Nice and crispy. I really wish there were more of those and less eggs. The salsa...there was not depth of flavor at all. It was just heat. My husband, who cannot find any kind of salsa that is hot enough, said that it was too mild. For me, it was only heat. No real flavor. It needed some limes, maybe some salt and/or sugar. Something. Really disappointed.   BUT, we have had great breakfast burritos here in the past, so we have not yet given up. We will come back again, and give it another try since we like this location. And yes, there are PokeStops nearby!",

Menu has a good amount of variety but my favorite is the stuffed sopapilla (pork verde please!) topped with the green chile. The Santa Fe Slider is a fairly unique offering, consisting of a slider-size burger patty folded into a tortilla and topped with green chile relish, spicy mayo, and cheese.",

It's definitely authentic New Mexican cuisine and with just a little tweaking they could make it much better. The restaurant is kind of set up in part to-go and part sit down. The food was very good but had a little too much sauce which made several dishes taste the same. There was good spice but with less sauce you could taste more of the individual flavors in each dish. The sopapillas are excellent though! I think it would be better as a QSR instead of sit down and a little quicker food service. Like I said this place has great potential they're just a little off.",

The soda machine was nasty, ice every where and sticky. My fathers tacos looked terribly sad and were bland. I got the ensalada with chicken. The dressing had no flavor, just hot, i had to salt it twice. As for the chicken there was maybe 20 flecks, not peices or chunks of chicken. My brother asked for black beans and got pinto beans in his burrito. His red sauce also had no flavor, just hot. The cliental is obvious with looking at the surrounding area, they obviously have pallets like ally cats. We will definitely not be coming back here",

    "text": "The red and green chiles here have always been my favorites. Bursts of flavor with a little kick! Love it! What I love even more is their new location! Bigger and better! Live music on the weekday I went! There's a full service bar too.   411 -- NEW LOCATION!  Strip mall on Sunset Rd/Green Valley Pkwy, Joe's Crab Shack is your visual cue on Sunset. -- Carlito's Burritos shares dining area space with their new bbq restaurant Live Fire Q (debuting this month) --  Fast/Casual style restaurant  To Go or Dine In orders   --here's the drill-- To Go - place your orders with cashier on Carlito's Burritos side of the restaurant Dining In - step on over to the dining area side shared with Live Fire Q and place your order with the cashier at the bar. You'll be assigned a number and you orders will be brought out to you.   I didnt see any menu boards, so grab one of the paper menus at the register.  --Food-- -- New Mexican Cuisine -- Portions are HUGE. Served in deep dish tin pie plates if you are dining in. -- Prices super reasonable! Even better, you get 5% off on every purchase if you are part of the Frequent Diner Rewards Program. So sign up for it,  Lately I go for the tamales, smothered in green chile sauce and cheese! Mmmmm. Stuffed Sopapillas stuffed with tender carne adovada (NM style pork) is REALLY good too.  -- Take advantage of spending an additional $3 more for choice of 2 sides and a sopapilla! That fry bread dough is magical! Have it drizzled with honey, or sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, order it as a dessert (Sopapilla Dulce) with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  -- Breakfast is served all day! Breakfast burritos are the bomb here too! So are the meat burritos. The regular size is plenty enough. Double meat size (+$2) ones are ginormous! And dont forget to smother those too!  Oh and once their Live Fire Q restaurant is up and running, they'll be serving up Santa Maria style bbq daily. No more waiting for the weekends.   Also new is the computerized soda fountain. It's touch screen and has many different soda drinks and options for flavors.   --Ambiance/Service-- Feels more festive. More spacious for sure. More busy too.  But CB crew can handle it! Eileen is awesome and so is Ashley. Everyone is friendly and helpful.    -- Summary -- Already was a fan, and this new spot they moved into made me a bigger fan. Cant wait till they fire up the grill!!",

Similar menu as your typical Mexican restuarant and a few of their own.   Had the Steak Carlito's Burrito (pic) which i really liked for $7.60 with all of it's 8 complimentary add-ons, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, salsa, and so on. guacamole and sour cream was extra. it was loaded with tasty chunks of steak, i could definitely taste a difference in the spices and seasoning. they also have a veggie burrito for $4.60 that you can mixup all kind of beans and rice together, or the combo burrito for around $6-7 which is the veggie and meat.  Total wasn't $12 yet so I added the Pork  Nachos for also $7.60.  They weren't that bad, had a bunch of ingredients that resembled those layered nachos dips what I usually eat while watching football. beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, peppers, guacomole, and sour cream and some large pork pieces. didn't care for their chips, shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly.  They have a good nightly special from 4-9pm. Mondays - Santa Fe Sliders for $1 Tuesdays -Beef Tacos for $1 Wednesday - HUMP DAY - 1/2 off breakfast burrito till 11 am and $6 pizzas. Thurdays - Bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6.50. Friday - Chicken, steak, and shrimp fajitas from $6-8. Saturaday - Ribs for $8.95 Sunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day.  they also serve beers, margaritas, and wine so that's cool.  they were busy during lunch, they had tables and a few bar counters to eat at. also like all of their pictures and their open view of the kitchen.",

Not worth the 75 cents I paid for it.  I ordered the steak burrito smothered with both red and green and sour cream, the steak was flavorless and burnt. The sauces were not good at all....My husband got a chicken tamale which unfortunately was mostly Masa and had zero flavor of what little meat there was.  Very disappointing.....Then ground beef enchiladas with green sauce. He says the enchilada was ok, but the sauce was nasty. Left a bad taste in your mouth. The food was edible, mostly.  The one bright point of our meal was the food came out fast and the Pepsi was fabulous    So to sum up, I will probably never go back, as we tried 4 different things and they were not very good.... I'm trying to figure out if the others that left 5 stars have no taste buds or went to a different place with the same name?? It's a mystery to me. We went on Monday the 20th of March",

This place was not busy when we walked in, it was about 4pm on a Monday. Anyhow a girl walk over and asked if we would like a drink and chips ,salsa and guacamole. We said yes to all the above. We ask for two beers, she then said we had to walk up to the bar to order ourselves. We then had to go seek out a menu. When she came back with our chips we were ready to order, she then said we had to walk up to the counter to place our food order.  Btw way the chips were covered in some kinda of dry pico and the gauc was nothing to rave about. Kinda don't know if this is like a fast food joint ?? However, we had the chicken tamale with green sauce and the frito nachos and the tortilla burger sliders. When our food came out it looked really good, but as we started to eat the disappointment sat in. The frito nachos were covered in like some Denny's canned chilli so not good but the tomatoes and lettuce was fresh. The sliders were not the best you could tell the beef was not fresh, it remined me of am/pm truck stop burgers. But the hatch chilli's on it were good. Now for the chicken tamale, i was excited for this but was let down. I cut into my first bite and it was all mesa, so i did  finally see the chicken, i then went to take another bite and then noticed a black short hair in my cheese on top of the tamale,btw this was served wet with hatch green sauce which was good ,and dressed with melted cheese and lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Now back to the hair,  so i scooped it out and set it aside in a napkin and was gonna wait to see if the girl was gonna ask how our food was. That never happened. So we were ready to  go and had to go back to the counter to pay, at that time my bf took the hair and the uneaten tamale up their and asked to have the tamale removed from our bill which was a 40 dollar tab  the tamle was 4bucks and some change. The manager at that time refused to do so and said that was a hair from the tamale wrap? So we paid and left, we still left a tip on the table but not sure why. My bf works in fine dinning and i just like to eat. We will not go back nor recommend this place. I'm giving one star because i have to in order to post this review.",

I wasn't sure if they were open as there is no open sign and it honestly looks like they are under construction as all of the signs are temporary. I checked the door and flagged my cabby to show he could leave.    I ordered the chorizo breakfast taco with red sauce and a Mexican Coke. Not long later I received a burrito the size of what I normally get from Chipotle and was immediately excited. After the first bite any hesitation after seeing the entrance was gone. The tortilla was toasted perfectly, not at all soggy. The chorizo was finely ground and was seasoned with great taste, as was the red chile sauce. And I believe what yielded the fifth star was the added crispy hash-browns. So good.   Definitely make the trip.",

    "text": "Not sure if they have different owners than the previous location but was definitely disappointed with Carlitos. To start the entry is definitely confusing especially when it's busy.  The girl taking our order said it was okay to order from her since midway through our order she sensed we wanted to dine in.  We ordered the burritos and I'm not sure what they brought us.  The old Carlitos location use to smother the burrito with red or green sauce and put the sour cream, onions tomato on the top.  The burritos we got today were wrapped in foil and were cold.  No sauce on them and the fixings were inside probably contributed to the cold burrito.  Don't get me started on the taste, I remember the green sauce packing a punch with spice and flavor that was also not present today.   On a brighter note the sopapillas were tasty, the only thing we enjoyed, but probably won't be going back",

While it had stuffed sopapillas and authentic roasted New Mexico Chile, 2 whole stuffed sopapillas, 1 pork and 1 steak, and a soda cost us $30 here, should've been $15-20. Besides the price, atmosphere was nice, place was clean. Food tasted good, but Mexican food that's $15/plate without a server should have more pizzazz, or quantity. We are the whole thing and we were still hungry. Their frozen bags of chile were $30/pound, we get ours from Albertsons for a lot less, from the same valley in New Mexico.",

All I could hope for was that the food was better than the service we were seeing.  I am happy to report that the food was terrific.  I had a pork burrito bowl.  The portion was large, and the meat was delicious.  My husband had the Navajo taco with the pork.  The fry bread was good.  It could have been a little more crispy.  We also had an order of chips and salsa which was delicious.  Overall, great food.  Would go back again.",

It wasn't as spicy as I had imagined but it was enough heat that you didn't have burning sensations when the food came out the other hole. As for meat, I think their pork verde is cooked perfectly. On the other hand, their chicken is not so great. I believe it was all dark meat and it didn't go well with the sopapilla because it made the dish heavier than it already was. If they had a white meat option, I'd definitely go for that! Lastly, we tried their chicken tamale and forgot to get it \"sauced.\" It came with a salsa and green sauce but it wasn't enough to help this plain tasting tamale. On the upside, the chicken was white meat.   I'm definitely a fan of Carlito's and will be coming back for more!",

    "text": "First off, I hear people complain that this isn't authentic Mexican food. Well, it isn't Mexican food. It's **New Mexican** food, just like you'll find down in the Land of Enchantment.   I LOVE New Mexican cuisine, green chile, and I love Carlito's! I've been a fairly regular customer since they opened and have yet to be disappointed with the food or the service. The staff is always friendly and most of them even remember my name- a real rarity these days. The restaurant is very small and does tend to get really crowded during peak meal times. However, even when they are busy the service is still pretty quick.   My favorites are the Carlitos Burrito with chicken or pork verde smothered in green chile and the pork verde stuffed sopapilla smothered green. If you like it extra spicy like I do, ask for a side of napalm sauce (essentially, it's a habanero puree!!) with your order. Burns. So. Good.   Occasionally on Saturdays, they do an oak pit BBQ tri-tip. It gets served up on a garlic roll with green chile and cheese and chile seasoned fries. This has got to be one of the best sandwiches ever made. If you get the chance, this sandwich doesn't disappoint (and it's big enough for two).   In the fall, they bring in Hatch green chiles and sell them by the bushel. You can pick them up fresh or they will roast them for you.  The smell of roasting chilies is almost a religious experience.   If you love New Mexican cuisine, stop in and give Carlitos a try.",

As if I needed further affirmation, the place was filled with diners in red (t-shirts, sweatshirts etc) with Los Lobos emblazoned on.

I came in on a Thursday around noon and this place was packed! I live around the area and I've always wanted to try them since I heard such good things about Carlitos. I finally had my chance last week. I ordered the sopapilla since that's their signature dish, right? I sat at the counter area right next to the cash register since I couldn't really find any other spots nor did I want to take an entire table to myself considering how busy they were. My order was served to me pretty quick and I was kind of shocked because it was busy and it's made to order type of thing. I was honestly a little bit underwhelmed by my order. The inside was just some kind of white fluff and the meat was just alright. I guess you really have to be from New Mexico to appreciate this kind of stuff. Although other patrons were ordering an assortment of different dishes that sounded delicious. I don't know if I will come back here and may just opt for somewhere like Cafe Rio.",

    "text": "If there was a tinder for food then Carlitos would be one of the places I would swipe right for. The bio would read something like this: big, giant portions. Green chile sauce all over everything. Burritos so big, you'll need two hands. What connoisseur of Mexican food would not be intrigued? I would message them with something to the effect of, Hi I'm a big fan of sopapillas, but I have a hard time finding them in Las Vegas, I especially love good service and margaritas. They would then respond: yes, we have sopapillas. You can get them with chicken or carne and red or green chile. And if you don't know there are also dessert sopapillas which are quite delicious. If none of the above entices you, then you can always stick to the basics: tacos and beer. There's domestic and imported cervezas. And on the taco front, there's a previously unheard of Navajo taco.  If you swipe right on this place, and decide that the aforementioned food sounds delicious then the cashier will pronounce you as a union and you can shortly expect a happy food baby in the immediate future",
