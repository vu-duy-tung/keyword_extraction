    "text": "I stayed in Vegas for a few nights last weekend.  One day, I found a flier for Flamingo Pizza slipped under my hotel room door.  I kept it with me just in case and I'm glad I did.  After a day club on Friday, we took a long nap and were too tired to go to a sushi restaurant as we originally planned. So I decided to give this place a try (I didn't check Yelp reviews).  I was told that the delivery time was anywhere between an hour and an hour and 30 minutes.  The food arrived right on time. We ordered chicken wings, one Hawaiian pizza, and one Flamingo Deluxe with two additional toppings (pineapples and jalapenos). The food was good. The Flamingo Deluxe with pineapples and jalapenos was so good that I wish I ordered two of them instead of one and Hawaiian. The order also came with two small containers of Ranch dressing.  Although the food was good and it arrived right on time, I'm giving this place 3 stars because I had to go down to the lobby to grab my order. The delivery guy called me upon arrival and asked me to come meet him at the lobby to pick up the order. Ummmm...this wasn't my first time ordering pizzas for delivery and I've never ever had to get out of my house (or hotel room in this case) to pick up my order. I gave the delivery guy less tip than I planned. I don't know if it was the delivery guy or Flamingo Pizza's manager that made the \"customer comes to the lobby to pick up their food\" policy but I'll never order from this place again.",

    "text": "Can't vouch for dining-in or carry-out, but the delivery... What a joke.  7:12 PM: Placed an order for a small Hawaiian pie and 2 cans of Coke.  8:12 PM: Exactly an hour after I ordered a small pizza, I got a call from the delivery guy, who told me his car broke down. I asked him \"what happens now?\" and he said to call the shop back and sort it out with them. And so I did. I explained to them that their driver had broke down on his way and they said they'd call him to figure out what to do. I then explained that the driver just told me to call THEM. Ok, so the guy at the shop said they'd get another driver to deliver my pizza. No apology, no discount offer, no time estimate.  8:30 PM: Hanger escalates  8:45 PM: A half hour later the shop called me again just to tell me that another driver was on his way. They never told me if this was the original pizza or a freshly baked one.  9:00 PM: Hanger reaches Defcon 1 status  9:12 PM: Two hours after my original phone call, another delivery guy arrived with a cold pizza. After expressing my dissatisfaction with their service (and assuring him it was nothing personal), he suggested that I call the shop for a discount. They offered 4 dollars off of a $22 bill. I told him to take $10 or they can have the order back. The guy on the phone originally declined (are you kidding me??) but the classy delivery convinced them to agree. He didn't even want a tip. Nice delivery guy, but 90-minute old, room temperature pizza, douchebag staff. And it gave me the runs in the morning. Won't be ordering again. Won't be changing this review. Don't even ask me. I'm not flying back in from NYC just to PICK UP a free pizza.  Get your act together and do right by the customer next time.",

They charge a \"yelp tax\" and a \"groupon tax\" and they do not take phone orders for either one. They tell you to come in and the wait is 2 hours for Groupon orders, no matter what. The large Hispanic woman at the register claimed these biased rules were clearly on the register for all to see, however, they aren't. She offered to find them for me, though. Yeah, I cancelled both yelp and Groupon coupons and will advise everyone that this place is a rip off and is actively falsifying offers.",

    "text": "This is usually a go to spot for us when we want good, fast, inexpensive eats. Our refrigerator is on the Fritz so we have had to kind of depend on take out for the past couple days.  Last night we ordered around 1am I got a Club sandwich for the first time and it was delicious! Nicely toasted bread, nice amount of turkey and crispy bacon. Nice slices of cheese. So good.  My husband got a meatball sub that he said was also REALLY good. The sauce was perfect, the meatballs were tender and fresh covered in gooey cheese on a crispy, soft roll. Both sandwiches came with a nice portion of fries. Bonus, our bill came out to under 20 bucks!!!  So tonight it was a no brainer, we were ordering from Flamingo again. My hubby decided to get the Philly cheesesteak. He was again happy with his selection. Fresh, crispy on the outside, soft, chewy on the inside roll. Nicely seasoned tender beef, onions, peppers, and mushrooms covered in cheese goodness. Little short in the French fry department tonight.  I was so impressed with the Club last night I figured I was going to have the same tonight. Boy was I dissapointed. First the \"toast\" was so pale I had to double check to see that it was in fact toasted. I mean some heat had been applied to the bread of only for a moment. Ok so the bread isn't toasted,ok....no biggie but then I noticed.....no cheese, no bacon and no onion ( I special requested the onion to be added) So basically after waiting an hour and a half ( oh did I not mention it took over 90 minutes to get my delivery) I ended up with a pitiful turkey, tomato and lettuce sandwich on three pieces of bread. So disappointed. I'm REALLY hoping this was juat a fluke.",

First of all the delivery was late, which I can see from other reviews that this is a common occurrence. Second, I had gotten a deal that includes a 2 topping pizza, 18 wings, & a 2 liter soda. What I received was a pizza, & a can of soda. When I asked for a refund all I got was 20% off my order. That was $5.60, that doesn't even cover the price of 18 wings. Plus they completely denied giving me a can of soda even when I sent in a picture. Horrible first experience, I won't be ordering from here again.",

Under new management , the customer service was outstanding Rebecca & angel were fantastic . I told them about why I hadn't been in awhile and they reinsured me I wouldn't be disappointed with my present & future visits ( I like the confidence in the future visits they predicted ) . Ordering the \"anytime\" special @ $27.99 +tax which included a 16\" inch pizza , ( pepperoni ) 18 chicken wings & a 2 littler of soda for 3 of us made for the perfect dinner , not only was our pizza fresh & hot it was made to perfection the wings were outstanding !! The atmosphere appeared to be updated & cleaner . I was giving the opportunity to meet the new owner \"Fatih\" who was kind enough to send us out dessert on the house . We went with the cheesecake after giving the choice between that or chocolate brownies . Thank you for going above and beyond flamingo pizza for bringing are business back , great customer service and a fresh , hot Quality pizza !!! I'm excited to say \" Rebecca\" & \"angel\"  , my friends & I will be back for a future visit again & again Good job & 5 stars deserved",

    "text": "First off I went to this place because I thought the Groupon deal was really good. I wish I had never spent my money here.. I order my food and then proceed to pay,  then the girl working there takes my phone from me and redeems my Groupon,  then goes off and tells me that she has to push the redeem button herself because her boss looks at the camera and if I do it the Groupon won't be honored.  Anyways I order my food mozzarella sticks,  order of shrimp, 2 sodas, and 2 orders of chicken fettuccine alfredo and the Cashier proceeds to tell the cook my order laughing telling her they ordered your favorite food and then hear the cook complain about it. Mind you this place is so small me and my mom can hear everything they say. Then while we wait for our food the pizza delivery guy comes in and the Cashier,  cook, and him have a full blown conversation both cursing and taking really loud about beating their kids ass if the misbehave, i don't know if it's just me but this is just horrible customer service.  When I finally get my food 30 minutes later I'm waiting for my garlic bread and sodas.  I ask where my bread is and I see that the cook realizes she burned my bread(it was bound to happen with them talking)  and then say it will be right out (10 minutes later I get them) Then I ask about my sodas and the Cashier says she never charged me for them,  which was a lie because I saw her write it down when taking my order and charging me,  but since I had no receipt because they didn't give me any and it was her word against mine, I had to buy 2 more sodas which was $3.50!! So I start eating my chicken fettuccine alfredo and the food couldn't have tasted any planner,  it honestly had no flavor whatsoever.  My mom who eats almost anything didn't even like it!!... I'm writing this review to warn people not to go here. Save your money and go somewhere else.  Horrible customer service and horrible food was all I got when I came here.. And now reading some reviews now I know why my total was so high,  because they charge a Groupon tax!!! People avoid this place!",

At this point we had already fallen asleep but the food arrived and we tipped the driver. The food itself was inedible, it was cold and soggy as hell. This happened about 2 days ago and I've been trying to reach a manager since then but all the employees I call keep telling me to call at different times, either in the morning, later in the afternoon, or at like 5-6pm when the manager comes in. Each time I call, the manager is never in and after reading these other reviews it seems that they are just dodging my calls. What's even more ridiculous is that there's no customer service number or anything online to contact anybody about this atrocious business and its' despicable management that never seems to be around. Do yourselves a favor and stay far away from this place.",

The food was very good! The pizza was huge, we ordered the 24\"! Wings were crisp, the only way I like them, flavorful and plenty. They had a lot of meat on them too! Service was great as well. Despite being very busy we did not feel rushed in any way. They ensured we were taken care of and had everything we needed. The dining area was quiet and perfect for our group of 5 and there were a couple tables outside if you wished to sit there. I am so glad that they were open late. It was very convenient and perfect for feeding five, three being teenage boys!! Definitely, recommend and would revisit next time we are in Vegas.  Also, note that we did use a Groupon which worked out well but you cannot use it on the specials or meal deals/packages. You do have to order everything separately. Which is not too bad I would use it again.",

Also, they don't come up to the rooms, you have to meet them downstairs.   The guy delivering our food wasn't wearing a uniform, it was just a regular guy.

Would have been nice to know that their order times were running long. When the food finally came, we noticed that the dressing for the salad was no where to be seen. I called back to complain and the lady answering the phones really could have cared less. She said they'd send it out \"if\" they delivered in the area again. It's been several hours now and no call. What's the point of eating a salad without dressing?  How can anyone think it would be acceptable and not offer even a partial refund? The pizza itself was also very meh... the meat lovers was a little sparse in the meat department. I went so far as to complain to the hotel lobby where I was staying at since I found the menu in my room and they told me that they have been calling the police on this place since they have people trespassing on their property to shove menus under the door.

In a nutshell: I'm not sure that's chicken. They're like deep fried patties of congealed animal fat. Something like imitation chicken but far squishier. Who knows? This might be what's passing for chicken fingers nowadays in Vegas. If that's the case, I take it all back and replace my review with an overall sense of pity for a whole town doomed to be served with the worst examples of chicken fingers possible. Sorry, Vegas.",

After I received my call, I went right down. No pizza guy at the bell desk, he was playing slots. Once I found him, he was a nice enough fellow, but when I asked for change (delivery was included in $32 order) he laughed and pointed to the slots and said \"in there.\" Geez! Really?! I was tired 3:50 am, so returned to enjoy our pizza. Sadly, the pizza was cold & burnt on the bottom, yet the cheese/oregano flavor was good at least. The fries were good too, but lukewarm. The wings were the same.   Would not order again due to the poor delivery, no change made, burnt pizza, and cold to lukewarm food. Two stars for flavor.",

    "text": "I ordered from this place about 3 times and their customer service and timing is terrible, they are always late, but kept ordering because pizza was good. Today though I feel ripped off and very upset at the pizza I got and realized is time to give them the review they deserve.  -First: Last time I ordered a salami pizza they literally put 4 tiny pieces of salami in the entire  16\" pizza.  -Second: So today I called to make sure this time they put a little more, since it was so por last time (seriously poor). Michelle, the owner apparently picked up and when I explained my previous situation very politely she had an awful and rude tone and her response was \"you have to pay for that\" as if I was some sort of cheap person. They are the cheap ones that don't put a decent  amount of salami. But anyway, I ended up asking her to put more salami and I would pay it. My total ended up changing from $22 to $31 because I \"upgraded the salami amount\" and added extra cheese to the other pizza I ordered.  -Third: Ordered at 7:40 pm and pizza arrived 9:20 pm. SLOWEST service I have ever experienced in my life for a freaking pizza, and is not the first time, and to top it, I live only a couple blocks away from them, literally!  -Fourth: Salami pizza that I paid $7 more for came with holes!!! It looked smaller and poor despite the \"upgrade\" un comparisson with the other 16\" pizza I ordered and it had missing pieces of dough. I am attaching pictures. And they had the nerve to charge me more for that. Absurd!!!  I am so mad with this place and with the lack of attentiveness of the owner Michelle, plus the long delays that seem to be custom (I ordered 4 times with this place, and in all of them they arrived very delayed). It is absolutely not worth my time and money.  There are plenty of pizza places in Las Vegas, unfortunately Flamingo pizza does not deserve my business anymore.",

To find yet ANOTHER paper ad about a place here in Vegas, at first I thought it was an automotive one like I usually get but this was for a pizza place less than a mile down the street from me. Me being a fat kid at heart and loving pizza I decided to try the place out. I give them a call and they had an awesome special. 16\" pepperoni pizza for 8 bucks! Sweet. I order and head down there.   I love hole in the wall places, the staff was very friendly, joked around with me, and the pizza smelt AMAZING. I don't write reviews often but this place definitely deserved a good one. New favorite pizza place and less than a mile away! Score!  Edit: I just finished my pizza... I just have to say nothing prepared me for the roller-coaster of emotions I was just on..  From the very first bite I took I had instant flashbacks of enjoying pizza in my home down with my Grandfather, him taking me and driving 2 towns over to a pizza place just like this one. The flashbacks from these memories instantly brought tears to my eyes as well as how damn delicious this pizza was. The crust reminded me my mother's homemade bread... Warm and fluffy but with just enough of a crisp to it, the cheese was so good and the sauce! Oh my the sauce! If I'd ever had a mouthgasm before then it was the second I tasted that amazing tomato sauce. This pizza is seriously so damn delicious it needs to be put in the world pizza hall of fame... Which will then need to be built just so this pizza can be entered into it. Then closed so that no other pizza could ever be put in it. Ever.   If this pizza were a woman I'd romance it, date it, then slap a ring on its delicious cheesy finger, then probably eat it and go to jail for life for murder... But it would be so worth it because of how delicious this pizza is.",

One and a half hours after eating the wings my husband got sick. His stomach gave him problems most of the following day. My chicken marsala looked like something they picked up at a fast food restaurant. What little chicken there was, was breaded and looked like they had taken chicken nuggets or 1 chicken tender and cut it up. I counted maybe six very very small pieces of chicken in the dish. The flavor was awful! The white pizza did not have any ricotta on it as advertised in their flyer. The delivery was supposed to take 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes. It took 2 hours! All of the food was luke warm when it arrived. Either the driver had too many deliveries or he went somewhere before coming to our hotel. I called the restaurant to complain and asked to speak to the manager and was told that the manager only works days. I tried calling them three times yesterday and was told each time that he was unavailable. I tried again today and was told he only works evenings. He is obviously trying to avoid speaking to me. My suggestion to anyone who is thinking about ordering from Flamingo Pizza is to think twice. The food is extremely bad!",

    "text": "I have one comment to say about this place and its \"HORRIBLE SERVCIE\"! I bought a Groupon online for this restaurant, and when I called to make an order the restaurant said that in order for me to use the groupon I would have to come in with the 4 people I was ordering for (even though that is not what the groupon requirements were). When we got to the restaurant my first opinion was how it didn't look too appealing, but hey some hole-in-the-walls are secretly the best, right? Well not this one!! Anyway, we waited almost 10 minutes while the workers occasionally stared at us but did not say anything. There were 2 people in the back making food, and 2 who were answering phones. Finally one of the workers, a lady with two tear drops tattooed on her face, asked me what I wanted to order. After I ordered my pizza and I began to get the payment together the lady answered the ringing phone again and walked away leaving me standing for at least 20 minutes before I decided that the food wasn't worth the disrespect and the time wasted. To say the least, we didn't even get the chance to try the food, but we can agree that this was the worst customer service experience that we have received from any company. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!",

Not only was the price hella reasonable, it was honestly delicious, annnnd it got here in under 30 minutes.  ~also our delivery driver was thee most colorful an delightful character.

They also snuck into the hotel resort we were staying in and shoved their menus under the doors of the rooms knowing the hotel forbids that.

    "text": "So we purchased a Groupon because we like to try new places & we like to support small, local businesses, but this is not one to support.  First of all, parking at this place is horrible especially on a Friday night.  The Groupon was dine-in only, we walk in to see a total of 6 tables, 4 that seated 2 people and 2 that seated 4 people, obviously this place doesn't get a lot of dine-in customers! We were there on a fairly cool night in Vegas, in one corner of the \"dining area\" the front door was propped open & in the other corner, a large utility fan was running at full blast....how inviting! We were quickly told that anything that said special on the menu could not be purchased with the Groupon, no problem. We ordered a pizza with extra cheese, mozzarella sticks, a Diet Coke and a water. While we were waiting, the conversation between the staff was completely unsavory, every other word was the 4 letter f-bomb, I'm fairly open minded, but wow! Once the Lord's name was taken in vain, I about jumped out of my skin! Okay to the food, we got a can of Diet Coke, it had dirt & what appeared to be cigarette ashes on the top, a bottle of water & our mozzarella sticks with some cheap paper plates. The sticks were good. Then comes the pizza..... they seriously set the pizza box on your little 2 seater table & walk away! The crust was the equivalent of copy paper.  Obviously, the ovens are not balanced because one side was done & the other was still gooey & raw, pretty difficult with that thin of crust! It was okay, but by the time we got it my blood was boiling due to the horrible atmosphere, constant swearing & freezing from the air blowing in. I definitely would not recommend this place, nor will I ever eat here again!",

She even gave me a free canned soda with my purchase. Food was actually made to order and came out hot and fast. The bag had the ranch and napkins ready for me which was nice.

    "text": "This place is shady, please don't get scammed and think twice before giving this place your business. My review isn't the first with this story, I actually just read one below with the exact same circumstance, and now I'm thinking this happens a lot.   Short version: driver went to the wrong hotel, half my order was missing, called and said they'd deliver it, never came, called for a refund....twice, haven't been refunded and, after reading other reviews, I'm not expecting to be.   Ordering was easy and I anticipated a heavy wait time considering it was dinner time, but I was pleasantly surprised when my driver quickly called to say he was down the street and would arrive any minute. I went downstairs and waited, no one there yet, but I figured there must be some traffic. I got a call from the driver and he was actually at a totally different hotel on the opposite end of the strip from where I was staying. Not sure what happened there, but the driver said he'd be at my hotel in about 20 minutes. He got there probably closer to 30-45 minutes later and apologized profusely. If that were the end of the problems I'd be ok with it.   But, after receiving my order, I walked over to a bench nearby to make sure everything was there and realized half was missing just as the driver sped away. I called the restaurant immediately to let them know and they said that they'd get the other half right out to me. After waiting a couple of hours, it never arrived so I called and asked for a refund and they said they could do that and put me on hold. When they came back they said that they'd give the manager my phone number and they'd call me to issue the refund.   That was on a Thursday.   After not hearing back for three days, I called the following Monday morning and asked to speak to the manager. I was told he wasn't in. I asked when he might be back and they said he comes in at random times and no one really knows when he'll be back (as mentioned in another review)--MAJOR RED FLAG. He asked if he could help so I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely upset that this wasn't taken care of, saying he knew the person who was on when I placed my order, they'd get right on it, it's good I paid with a card and not cash because that's so simple, bla bla bla. I was feeling slightly optimistic until the guy was ready to hang up and I had to ask him if he needed my phone number, because how else was the manager supposed to find my order and call me back to issue the refund? Red flag #2.   I'm still waiting for that phone call and a refund. Not going to hold my breath. This place is shady as hell. They're scamming customers. Please don't give them your money, they'll probably scam you like they did to myself and others.",

In the picture you'll see, I poured it in a disposable bowl. The food was cold and tasteless. Do not buy from from this restaurant the food honestly is disgusting.",

I open the bag, and there's a salad, coke & pasta... no cheesecake. So I call back and ask, they told me they have me down for \" can of coke\", not cheesecake. How the hell I would know to order \"can of coke\" I have no idea but whatever. I just hang up and proceed to eat and the pasta doesn't even have sauce. Literally just noodles and chicken (see attached picture). Do NOT order here. Horrible customer service and food.",

The food in and of itself was wonderful, and we would have gladly returned again and again despite it's small, inconvenient location. This rating is based solely on the temperature inside the pizzeria, and the conversation we were privy to during their very ill-timed staff meeting in the dining area. During this staff meeting we overheard conversations about a dirty microwave, dirty restroom that isn't  cleaned regularly, dirty fryer oil that smokes from lack of cleaning, up to and including a conversation about their roach problem and fumigation practices. There were disgruntled employees verbalizing their grievances, and an owner so frustrated that he cursed more than once. In addition to this conversation that we would have gladly gone without, we were subjected to very hot temperatures inside the dining room, where the only shaded area hosted the staff meeting that was taking place. This was also where the only small fan on the premises was located. Our food was so plentiful, and our table so small that we had to sit at a different table away from where our pizza was.  And while we sat there fanning ourselves with menus.... at no point did anyone ever offer us the more convenient, cooler seats in the corner where the staff meeting was taking place, that could have accommodated our entire purchase. Phenomenal food.... but sadly, a terrible experience. We will never eat here again.",

My kids (27 and 14, so I use the term \"kids\" loosly) loved the tenders, liked the wings, and loved the pizza. The critic of the house, my wife, thought everything was average, but she's tough so if you have a tough one as well, use what I say she says in my reviews. The prices aren't bad but this place is mainly for take out and delivery as the location does have a few tables, but nothing you would be able to have a family dinner on.

After he cussed me out and hung up on me I called back several times was placed on hold several times then was told  the pizza was on the way and that I should receive a call from the driver in four mins or less that was over 30 mins ago, still sitting here on yep taking my time to write this review and no call.  I work at a pizza place and would never in a million years recommended this place to anyone.  Typical Vegas attitude towards their customers, they act like they are doing me a favor to pay them for service.  Can't rate the product because I haven't received it going on two hours now. I am sure if it's anything like their customer service that it will be horrible.  Don't waste your time with this place it's an absolute joke. Still waiting for this magical pizza to arrive ?",

Once we opened our three bags of food we realized we got three salads, no dressings at all. Also noticeable were the mounds of olives on everything after we specially ordered \"no olives.\" Butter-soaked bread everywhere, after we ordered \"no butter.\" Lastly, the 20 sticks of zucchini was not to be found! We called immediately and were told \"the manager would need to call us back\"... Now after 1pm... Never did we get a call back. So we began attempts to get the zucchini and at least dressing for the salads. As I write this it is 2:16 am and the promised food has never arrived. The food we already received was fine, although the homemade chicken noodle soup was too salty and strangely similar to Campbell's.......",

    "text": "I'm in town by myself this week for a conference and even though my company is hosting a free dinner tonight, and party, I decided to stay in my hotel room and order out because my feet hurt and I have blisters. I ordered a margarita pizza, raviolis with a salad and garlic bread and a two liter of soda. The Margarita Pizza had sauce on it. Margarita pizzas aren't supposed to have sauce. The raviolis were drowned in sauce and there were only 5 raviolis in the dish. I included a picture. The Margarita Pizza wasn't cooked and the salad dressing they delivered was the wrong salad dressing. The menu stated Diet Coke so I ordered a Diet Coke and they sent a Diet Pepsi. When the driver arrived he called me and said I needed to come down and pick it up. I explained to him that I was in my pajamas and I couldn't walk cuz I had blisters on my feet. If I could walk I would have eaten at one of the other 1 million restaurants that were in the lobby of my hotel. Money wasn't an issue I just had a hard time walking and wanted to stay off my feet. It feels like a mile from my hotel room to the lobby. He argued with me extensively and I cut him off and said, \"Why was I even asked what my hotel room number was if I was going to have to go to the lobby and pick up my food? They should have explained that on the phone.\" He said he couldn't leave his car. Last night, when I came back from my conference, I saw a driver putting menus under the doors of all the hotel rooms on my floor. If in fact it's True that the drivers aren't allowed to leave their cars and deliver food to the hotel rooms then why did I see a guy delivering food and putting menus underneath the doors? Hands down, of all the places I've ever eaten at, this is the worst restaurant I have ever witnessed in my life!!! I just hope there were no bugs in any of the food that I did eat.",

One hour and thirty minutes later, we finally get our pizza. It was absolutely Ice cold and inedible, and they didn't give us plates. When we called to complain, they put us on hold 15 mins. Calling back several times, they blocked our number. We called back again, got put on hold again. A third call later, we asked to speak to the manager and was told there wasn't one there, but that they would call us back. Do not waste your time with this place unless you want a cold, doughy overpriced mess. As a side note, this place isn't allowed to solicit or deliver at the Westgate Resort. Flamingo Pizza is shady.

You might want to park in the other side by 99 ranch.  When we first entered there was no greeting with the four workers behind the counter. The menu by the counter just showed pictures with no sizing or prices listed. Only once we tried to seat ourselves did some guy with glasses yelled \"hey you ready to order?!\" I had to grab a menu off the tables to see what exactly they offered. Between ordering I wanted to check in on yelp and I was offered a free soda, but the guy didn't believe me and wanted me to leave a review before getting my free soda. Then the lady yells my name is Irene like I'm suppose to give her a nice review when she didn't even acknowledge or bother to help in the first place. You could tell this place was struggling by the calzone tasting like a plain hot sandwich with no sauce according to my dinner date, he had to ask for marinara sauce and suggested he minus well just go to subway. Literally watched a whole episode of vampire diaries on the TV while waiting for our order lol.  If youre okay with the place being cold and not much heat this is the place to be.",

It had literally been 5 mins possibly less. We will dispute this with the credit card company. He said good luck! The place is a scam!",

So it's under new management and improved!   Street parking infront. Great customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean.   I tried their pesto chicken pizza, white pizza with basil, bacon cheeseburger and fries and chicken Caesar salad. They have sooo much variety on the menu.   They deliver and open till 4am during the weekdays and 530am during the weekend. Which is great for late night eats and an alternative to other asian options in Chinatown . Very close to the strip if you're looking for cheap and yummy eats after partying and they can even deliver to you!   I'm a fan! Will be back for more!  Flamingo pizza has a pizza my heart!

When she read me back my number back I noticed that she got it wrong and tried to correct it but was hung up on. So then I called back to confirm my number to which she then rushed me off the phone while assuring me that she had my number. Keep that in mind. So not only did my food come an hour and twenty minutes late when I tried to cancel prior to getting my food when it was just  an hour late the rude operator hung up on me twice without giving me my refund. She said I'd be charged anyway for their terrible service effectively stealing my money. The icing on the cake is that the delivery women finally called me after being an hour and twenty minutes late and told me that she didn't have the right number. Then when I got downstairs the food was ice cold. The delivery woman knew she was an hour late and still expected a tip. Them was mad when I rightfully refused to do so. I should have expected that beforehand because by then I already knew I was dealing with an unprofessional establishment.  Do not, I repeat DO NOT, order from the horrific establishment. They are frauds and thieves who operate without knowing the meaning of the word costumer service and do not deserve anyone's patronage. And apparently most of the other yelpers who have encountered these charlatans agree with me. I wish ruin upon this criminal establishment.",

It is conveniently located near Rio hotel.   Eileen greeted us as soon as we walked in. The vibe in the pizza shop is cozy and friendly. There is a big screen TV to entertain while you wait for the food or to enjoy while eating.  The pizza itself was AMAZING. I got half cheese half pepperoni. I would advise to let sit a minute or two because it is baked fresh and needs a moment to settle. Be careful it's HOT!  All around great experience, thanx Eileen!",

We were given a delivery time of one hour and exactly on the hour there was a knock at the door.  Well, man oh man am I sorry that I waited until the last night to try this place.  I was there on business for 11 days; what a miss.  The salad was really fresh, not bag-o-salad or wilted stuff, the salad was amazing.  Such crunch and so much for a side salad!  My daughters Greek salad was great and she couldn't finish it.  The Marinara sauce on the cheese ravioli actually had flavor and the ravioli were large, filled and flavorful.  I will be in town again in January, this time there will be zero hesitation when ordering in!",

First of all they messed up the whole order, like we asked for a Xtra Large cheese pizza and they gave us a hot sauce, pineapple pizza & we didn't realize until we took a bite. We ended up calling the pizza man back, letting him know that we got the wrong pizza. We gave him back the pizza that was the wrong one but he ended up taking 4 slices, using his hands, from our pizza to the pizza we gave back to make it a whole one and deliver it to the other people. So in other words our pizza got the 4 slices off of it because we took pieces from the other one. Meanwhile he used his bare hands to touch the pizza. This is just all sorts of wrong and definitely violating the health codes. They wouldn't give us a refund till we walked there and waited an hour and a half and didn't refund the whole order. Meanwhile we didn't even eat everything we took minimal bites and got sick. We even have a brief video of the pizza getting transferred. I RECOMMEND NO ONE EATING HERE EVER!! AND IF THERE WAS AN OPTION OF 0 STARS THATS WHAT THIS PLACE WOULD BE!!!",

They delivered 4 twelve ounce cans of coke and a cheese pizza.  2 liters of coke is equivalent to 5.6 cans of coke.  How convenient for them.  I called them and reported it and they said they would call me back and then never did.  The pizza was so bad I couldn't eat it.  I put the pizza and soda back into a bag and then  I delivered it back to their store which had a sign on the door which said it was under remodel.  Anyway I was able to get someone to the door.  I gave them back their pizza and soda and told them that they needed to credit back my money.  They just yessed me and no intention of making good on it.  I will help them by calling the credit card company.  Afterall I didn't sign anything so they have no proof of delivery.  Stay away from these scammers.  It is obvious that they are just taking advantage of tourists so they can provide lousy service since they are not counting on a repeat business.  Stay away from these delinquents.",

We called them and ordered one of their speciality deals. It was a pepperoni pizza and wings. The quote time was about 60-75 mins, which was ok because we wanted to get ready anyways. We received the pizza after TWO hours of waiting! By that time we were starving...then we get ready to eat it and it's super COLD! After 2 hours of waiting we were furious. We called and spoke to someone about it and was told that she would call the driver and call us back. After 20 minutes we called back and she gave us an attitude saying \"yes I know you just called I haven't called my driver yet it has only been 5 minutes\" so I hung up and never received a call. All in all customer service was terrible, pizza was cold, and after warming it up the microwave food was still not very good. Our advice STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AND DON'T ORDER FROM FLYER YOU FIND IN HOTEL ROOMS!",

The crust has a really great garlic flavor to it! I usually prefer my crust thinner New York style, but the flavor made up for the thickness.

    "text": "I was planning to go home and fix some lunch on my day off, but the doctor's appointment took about an hour longer than usual (98% wasting away in the many exam rooms where the nurse takes you blood pressure). Since I skipped dinner and breakfast, I opted to find a new place to try without going over $20.  So I searched which Groupon I still have to use before they expired and also browsed what good deals they might have. Ultimately decided on getting a new Group promo on Flamingo Pizza, since it is only a slight detour and a new place To try (even in spite of the low ratings).  The place was emptied when I first arrived, but after the lady greeted me the phone calls started coming in for delivery orders, which was fine since I was still looking over their menu.  I decided to order the 18\" Flamingo Deluxe pizza since it will use up the full value of the Groupon plus another $4.    The pizza is the thinner crusted variety. The dough is made fresh, not the best I have ever had, but also not oily like Pizza Hut's pizzas. The toppings used are also fresh, just seemed a bit light compared to other photos uploaded on their Yelp page.    If you plan to have pizzas made at Flamingo Pizza, I recommend having it on premise. Nothing beats freshly baked pizzas just a minute or two after coming out of the oven.  It is still good after you personally take it home, leaving the takeout box not completely closed, since I can see it gets soggy if the trip home takes more than 20-30 minutes (one of the main complaints of delivery orders that takes over an hour).  So if you work or live in the vicinity of Las Vegas's Chinatown Plaza and bored of the many good Chinese, some Japanese and Korean and even Thai restaurants menu offerings, maybe pizza or calzones within walking distance will the perfect cure.    They open really late, 4am most nights and 5am on weekends. Viable option for those late night pizza cravings when your freezer is out of stock of Red Barron's frozen pizza pie.",

Would highly appreciate it if they weren't rude over the phone. We ordered the large pizza and it came out to be about $18+. We were recommended by a friend about this place saying they had very cheap pizza. We gave them a call saying we want a large pepperoni pizza for takeout. The lady didn't tell us our total, and sounded like she was being rushed then hung up. Well of course it's our mistake as well not asking what's our total but a common courtesy for them to tell us a total over the phone without asking would be nice. Came in got our pizza, was shock on the total but we didn't want to make a fuss about it then left.  The pizza we ordered was good, had the thin crust style. Was served ready and hot when we picked it up. No complains about the pizza just the service could use some good phone etiquette.",

How does this even happen? - Also, you have to go and meet the sketchy delivery driver outside the hotel doors because they are not ALLOWED to solicit hotels to begin with.

I ended up ordering the same, with two extra sides of fries (I like fries, what can I say?), and when they told me their minimum delivery order was $15, I added a can of soda.  Two hours later (and an hour after being told my order was being cooked), I got what I ordered.  The fries were pretty good, and the burger was actually good.  But, looking at their website in hindsight, their posted minimum delivery order is $10.  So, my burger and a soda would have met that requirement.  So, I spent $25 for something that I'd have spent $20 at my hotel for.  Not to mention, just like previous reviews... somehow, they find ways to slip their fliers underneath room doors they shouldn't even have access to (I've already sent an email to the hotel I stayed at this weekend with suggestions on how to prevent this in the future, since their front desk confirmed that they didn't put them under my door).  Needless to say... since I was literally about to order UberEats when this order arrived, and I didn't want to be a jerk about the whole thing, I accepted it, tipped, and moved on with my life... until reading these reviews and noticing how close they were to my own experience.  Looks like the Luxor doesn't like you guys, either.  Good luck.",

    "text": "Like everyone else, my review is going to cover how this place is run by garbage management and was disappointing from start to finish.    I'm a patient woman, so when I placed an order on a Saturday night, I knew it was going to take a while.  1.5 hours is nbd.  But two minutes past the \"latest they'll get there\", when I hadn't heard anything, I called to check on my order and it was \"on the way\"  It did indeed arrive a few minutes later.    Half of my order was missing - and because it was already so late and the poor delivery driver was clearly very busy (and polite!) I declined his offer to go back and get my missing items.  I decided to call for a refund.    When I called the person promised she would put a note on the manager's desk to refund my items that I didn't receive.  I also let her know that one of my pizza that did arrive had ONE CUT into the pizza that only went halfway through.  i.e. it wasn't sliced.  Literally, there was 1 cut halfway through the pizza and that's it.  Absurd!  After 10 business days, when I didn't see a refund, I called the business, and the real shenanigans started.  I have called 6 times since then, each time, they tell me to call at a different time because the manager isn't in.  I've called at 11 am, at 8 pm, at 5 pm, all times that the person on the phone recommended because the \"manager is only in when we open\" or \"the manager only comes in at 8 to pick up the money bag.\"  RIDICULOUS.  It is a month and a half later, I Don't have my refund, and the only way I can get it...per the suggestion of an employee, is to dispute the charge with my bank.  Same employee also suggested I \"swoop in\" between 11 and 2 when the managers are there so they can't dodge me anymore.  That is CRAZY that I would have to do that.    To top it all off...the pizza isn't very good.  Pizza Hut was 100% better in all ways than this business run by jerkwads.  I will never recommend them, I will post this review everywhere, and I will tell all my coworkers on business travel to avoid this place at all costs.",

I understand that some places get slammed with orders but giving my order to another customer is another thing. I gave them another chance after they offered me discount and a shorter ETA (25 min). 45 mins later, the food shows up but they forgot my soda; pizza and appetizers were cold. At this point, I'm not angry, just in disbelief. I've never had such bad service in my life. It's almost comical. I'm not a yelper but I signed up so I can write a review on this place. If you should choose to eat from here, do not, I repeat, do not pick the delivery option.",

Price point is a touch high from what I was used to however this is Vegas and is comparable to everything else. Definitely would order again!",

We tried them because they slipped a menu under our room door at Tahiti Village (timeshare) and thought it would be easy plus they offer gluten free. We placed the order at 6:00 and were told an hour for delivery. 45 minutes later, my brother realized he forgot to order salad so he called back. The lady said it hadn't gone out yet but we were next in queue and she could add our salads. She confirmed our address and name and gave us a revised total. Over an hour goes by and still nothing. We call back and a different woman answers the phone. She begins to argue with us claiming they are too busy to make promises about delivery time. We explain it's been 2 hours and the delivery guy finally arrives as we're on the phone. The pizza is cold and there are no salads. In addition, the cost is more than the total we were given on the phone including salads. She finally puts the manager on the phone, and his only solution was to take $15 off the bill. So we paid more than $40 for cold, cardboard pizza with skimpy toppings. This was absolutely the worst experience any of us have had for pizza delivery!",

I've been to a pizza place and seen how busy it gets but never have I ever wait this long for a take out at a pizza place that clearly was not busy at all. People are rude. Customer service is horrible. No one cares about getting your order on time. There are roaches running as round on the floor. No one is wearing a hair net and apparently good hygeine is optional here. Never come to this place ever. I've never given any place a bad review but this had to be done. If I could give this place a 0 I would. They also don't give refunds because unfortunately the manager doesn't have the \"code\" to give out refunds. He didn't even have the common courtesy to let me know that my order was going to take longer than he quoted. Will never come back here ever again.",

At 4:08 I got a call from the delivery driver saying he was at the palms, which I am at the luxor...he kept tryinging to tell me I gave the adress for the palms. I TRIPLE CHECKED! Nope. I gave the right address. Called the restaurant back. Same nonsense about my order not coming in until an hour after the intial order. Maybe they should use a different program for online ordering. 4:36 Delivery guy just called me to explain that he had no idea where the room was ...I tried as clear as I could to explain it and he hung up on me. I am beyond upset at this point....I have no idea if he is coming or if I am screwed out of $30! It is now 2 hours and 30 minutes and I get called to the front desk to pick up my pizza...get the pizza back to the room....pizza is cold and order is wrong...we were also told we would get a complimentary 2 liter for the inconvenience....we did not.",

Ordered a pizza, just BBQ sauce, chicken & onions.  Paid to have it delivered to our hotel, when my boyfriend brought it up to our room, I noticed it was a regular cheese pizza with chicken and BBQ sauce on top. Called and let them know, the pizza was incorrect, I was told that was the standard for that pizza, a manager would call me about 3 hours later when their shift started to resolve the problem. About an hour after they were supposed to call, I gave them another ring. That's when Ruth answered the phone, I explained the situation and she told me that no manager was scheduled until the next day! She went out of her way to contact the manager on their time off, and got us a (correct) free 12\" BBQ chicken pizza. I am BEYOND SATISFIED with Flamingo Pizza and Ruth for going out of her way to fix the problem. Recommending this place to everyone, pizza was great so I will be coming back :)",

I vaguely recall getting pizza at least once but it didn't make enough of an impression to leave a review. Ordered takeout wings for a VGK game night and they were dry - both in terms of being overcooked and barely sauced.   I recently purchased a Groupon to use on a future visit but luckily saw some posted signage that basically invalidated the deal- Groupon is for takeout but they require that you be there in person to place your order (rather than by phone) with at least two people present, regardless of how many people you are ordering for or how much you spend. Who even does that? I figured a business with zero customers on a weekend with low ratings couldn't possibly be in a position to turn away business, but a staff member clarified that they would rather I get a refund from Groupon (and not come back at all) than come back and try to use it without following their arbitrary rules that contradict both the fine print AND common sense. Good luck with that.",

    "text": "I ordered through yelp last night for delivery of this pizza establishment because of their menu. I was craving a good white pizza which is hard to find. I looked no further than than Flamingo Pizza. I also ordered a side appetizer of breaded mushrooms. After ordering I was panicking since all of the reviews from here were so awful. I unfortunately did not base my ordering off the reviews.  The white pizza was fantastic and the even seemed like they used extra feta cheese. I was so impressed there was not even any leftovers for breakfast pizza. The breaded mushrooms were not the best, but I popped them in the microwave and they were just right. Problem alleviated. I did notice that prior patrons had issues with the times of their delivery and it being delayed. I did notice that it was 45 minutes late, but I fell asleep watching the tele so it was not an issue for me. I would order from this establishment again. And I would advise individuals ordering use the yelp app. It seems all other complaints dealt with human error. Save yourself some pain and use technology plus it leaves tracking for your order.",

After waiting an hour, I called to see where it was, the lady that answered let me know it was being packed up & would be on its way. 20 minutes later (mind you we work .6 miles from this place), the lady who delivered it did not apologize for the wait or anything & was just super dry...my coworker prepaid and pre-tipped unfortunately. The pizza we ordered, 1 pack of red peppers and Parmesan cheese for a partially burnt pizza. Coworker got garlic Parmesan fingers...it was so sloppy, one othe fingers didn't even have parmesan on it. He could not finish it. We also ordered the big combo that is SUPPOSED to include all the appetizers, but it was missing the mozzarella sticks & it was just thrown altogether sloppily into 1 box. Not worth the 45 dollars that was spent.   SAVE YOUR MONEY! BOYCOTT FLAMINGO PIZZA!",

Ever wonder what that cardboard tastes like? This pizza gives you the unique and rare opportunity to try it!  The fries: If you enjoy dipping your fries in water and/or like to leave frozen fries on the counter until they defrost to room temperature, these are for you!   The garlic bread: Sarcasm aside, I think they forgot a step here. Unless they're trying this new thing where they butter a piece of bread, rub a little garlic on it and serve it cold. Never had a cold and uncooked garlic bread, so I'm really hoping this one was a mistake.   If intoxicated, this meal might be tolerable. If you've tried this place, you know I'm not exaggerating.  If I can only reach one person and keep them from ordering this god awful \"food\" then It'll all have been worth it.",

In other words, the placed looked clean, the staff was friendly and professional, etc. I just didn't like the pizza -- perhaps you might:  I tend to like my pizza with an \"average\" (based on eating hundreds of different pizza shops' pizzas) or even \"extra\" amount of sauce. If there is a bit less sauce than average, that's fine too, but not what I prefer.  Now, maybe this particular neighborhood's taste runs toward the \"drier\" version of pizza, and I get that -- you have to gear your recipe to your client base, but there was literally almost NO sauce on the pizza. You know those big flat spoons that a lot of pizza shops use to scoop the sauce? Not the deep things, but it looks like a giant teaspoon? On a large pizza it seems as if this one had maybe a half of a spoon of sauce skimmed over the dough and not a drop more. For most bites, I actually could not even taste sauce. It was more like a toasted crust with melted cheese on it.  As I've said, if that's your thing, then by all means give this place a try! We all have different tastes and preferences. But if you like a good, saucy pizza and consider the sauce a crucial ingredient, you might want to try another shop.",

The honey dipped chicken, came with 4 pieces of chicken: 1 breast, 1 thigh, 1 wing, and 1 leg. The pieces were kind of small, especially the wing and leg. This also comes with French fries, a small container of baked beans and 2 pieces of garlic bread. I was a little upset that the item doesn't mention everything that it came with, so I ended up having 2 orders of French fries.  For the food itself, the chicken had a nice taste to it, but it was a little overcooked. The baked beans were good, you get about 2 tablespoons of baked beans, and the 2 pieces of garlic bread were really just 2 pieces of sub bread with some garlic butter spread. The bread would've been better, if it was toasted after the spread was put on, instead of being soft and almost soggy. I give this a 4 star review, due to the combo, the taste and the availabity. If the portions were a little bigger and cooked a little better, it would be worth the 5 stars. They were open late, and that was a plus.",

Had no idea what to eat or where to go so decided to give this place a try.   After ordering on the phone and being given an estimated delivery time within an hour, I decided to check the reviews on yelp and to be honest, I immediately regretted my decision. It was only because there were so many bad reviews about their delivery service. After many reviews, I was already convinced I wasnt going to get my food.   To my surprise, the delivery came on time (about 10-15 minutes after estimated delivery, but that was expected) there was a knock on my door. Confused, I opened it and there was my food! I was glad because I didnt have to go to the lobby to pick it up like they told me to so thumbs up for that!   Food was still hot and all super yummy!! Bottom line, this place is worth a try despite the reviews. Might have something to do with the new owner, or so I read. Very pleased!",

Fresh Paint, shiny floor, stylish counter and smiling faces, this place looks different... It was an originally pick up but I had to wait a couple minutes for my pizza to get ready then we decided to stay and eat on-site with my wife...  Pizza was good as always.  Keep up the good work new management...",

    "text": "After my first review, I was contacted by the new owners via a Yelp message. They read my \"unsatisfied\" review and asked me to stop by and pick up a free 16\" pizza, on them.  I called in to confirm this deal and was assisted by Jade. She is the wife of the owner, Fatih; she helps him with the online reviews. She told me to come by and was very friendly. We headed over to Chinatown; the shop is located at the edge of one of the big plazas off of Wynn.   The shop is quaint; the paint was fresh and everything was clean for the most part. The owner came out to meet me and shook my hand. Jade also greeted me with a handshake and a smile. He immediately began to express his apology and he seemed truly genuine. He explained that he took over the shop about 5 months ago and they are still getting some of the logistics in order. I mentioned the confusion with their websites, and he explained that they are working with Google to get everything fixed. The previous owner must have dropped everything in their lap, with them to sort through the confusion.   They offered me my pizza, it was hot and fresh. (I made sure to try it in the car while it was still fresh so I could get a better idea about the quality and flavors.) The crust was soft and fluffy. There were even some seasonings added - like basil and oregano - for increased taste. Overall, the ingredients were fresh. I am a pizza fanatic, so I will not say it was the BEST pizza in the whole WORLD. But I will say that for less than $10 in Chinatown, it is actually a very good deal.   I recommend that you carry-out if you live far or if you think it will be a busy night - the pizza is best hot. I haven't tried the wings again; they were big, so that is a plus.   Look, the truth is, this is a mom and pop place with new owners. It isn't perfect, and I think they are still working out the kinks. But if they are willing to reach out and make things better, they deserve the opportunity of your business. Very few places respond to Google or Yelp reviews, let alone offering to replace your meal or a free pie.",

First the \"delivery\" took two hours (lady over the phone said it would be an hour, maybe less), and by \"delivery\" i mean lobby of the hotel. They asked me for my room number when i placed the order but then called me to go downstairs TWO HOURS LATER. IT WAS 3 AM AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS NOT HAPPY. Then when i was asked to go to the lobby, the girl forgets the card receipt so i can sign (i paid card over the phone). She calls the place back and I WAIT HALF AN HOUR while she's on hold/arguing with the employee on the phone (manager i presume). She then informs me SHE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE RESTAURANT, GET THE SLIP, COME BACK SO I COULD SIGN IT. At this point i was furious and told her i didn't want it anymore, so to cancel it. She tells me i have to call the place and cancel, also the money wouldn't be back on the card immediately, but the food was already there and i was starving so i decided to keep it. At the end i didn't know what the lady did but I did not go back downstairs to sign the slip. OH AND SHE STILL HAD THE AUDACITY OF ASKING IF I WANTED TO LEAVE A TIP. Also, this place doesn't even use their real name! The flyer in our hotel room just said \"Pizza and Grub\" so there is no way of checking reviews before hand!!!!!",

Pizza delivered to my hotel lobby at 3AM is a necessity. I can get two 18\" one topping pizzas (always mushrooms and pepperoni) in under an hour and for roughly $30 (including tip). They deliver to the entire Strip but can only go as far as the hotel lobby, but do you really want a stranger knocking on your hotel room door at 3AM? Their pizza is super tasty by the way. I must've killed half of one pizza laying in my bed watching The Walking Dead reruns after a longass night of clubbing. Never tried anything but their pizza, but if you're going to call a pizza store and order a burger or a Philly cheesesteak and then complain about it, you really need to take a good close look at yourself in the mirror. Oh, and that other half, if your hotel has a microwave, you've got breakfast! Thanks for taking care of my 3AM pizza cravings Flamingo Pizza, I'll definitely be calling you the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Was told that I must of misheard and would be hour and 10 mins. They told me with lots of attitude \"u still have 10 mins left\". The food arrived at lobby 30 minutes later. Granted it takes 5 minutes from their place to our hotel(with traffic)They forget a part of the meal. When I call the driver he says he does not know about it. When I call the restaurant all I was told is that he would talk to the driver and never even bother to say I can send u another or refund partially for the mistake. The food was ok nothing great. (Pretty bad when u are starving) it is not at all convenient due to the horrible wait time and not to mention the rudeness of service. The restaurant never bothered to call back to see about my order that was not delivered. Please avoid this place. Find another pizzeria or eat something else. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!",

I don't know if they have changed the dough,sauce, and/or cheese but it just doesn't take the same. Gave 3 stars just because the lady at the front was nice. The pizza was worth the price before, but over priced for the quality now.",

I called and ordered 2 pizza's and a large dinner salad and my time was 1 hour and 10 mins.  Plus I used their Yelp deal and checked in to get a free can of soda.  When I asked about it I was told that I couldn't use the checkin but I would need to order then review then call back so they could verify I reviewed and I would get a free two liter.  I said well never mind that's  a lot of work and he said don't worry I'll bring your \"can\".  Later, an hour and a half to be exact I hadn't received our order so I call back and was told it is in route.. 10 mins later the delivery man texts me says he's in lobby so apparently its delivery to the lobby not your room and I get my food.  No soda, no  Parmesan  cheese or red pepper flakes!  Then we get to the room and we get a tiny bit of dressing for a large dinner salad... Like minimal!! Plus the pizza wasn't great super basic and kinda cold... I wouldn't order again just saying...",

Waited 20 minutes til he got back. I was in a hurry to get back to work. Once I got to work I opened the pizza box and half the pizza was burnt also the mild wings had no sauce at all on them. After having spent over an hour just trying to get the pizza I called the business only to be hung up on, called back and was put on hold for 15 minutes then for the girl to say my manager isn't here and that I need to leave a message. Never ordering here AGAIN. They ruined the lunch for my work teammates and wasted a lot of valuable time.",

If you like greasy, bland, minimal topping pizza -this is your place. If you like your delivered salad warm and your cheesecake dessert frozen -this is your place. If you get a promised delivery time of an hour and 10 minutes and it takes an hour and fourty and you're OK with that- this is your place.  Their company policy does not allow them to do in room delivery, so if you're OK with walking from your room, across the property and waiting in the lobby for a call to come from the driver letting you know that he is still on the way and you're OK with that- then this is your place. Oh yes, don't forget the five dollar delivery charge and make sure you tip well, and if you're OK with that- then this is definitely your place.  In a town with so many choices and options, this shouldn't be one of them, Unless you were confined to your room, without a car, and almost out of toilet paper due to diarrhea.",

I waited until 2:50 but no one called or came so I called again but the lady said \"So what is your question\" when I told her my name and address. She said she'll call the driver and after few minutes, someone knocked on my door. When my husband opened the door, a highschool boy just handed us a box and left. Didn't ask what I/we ordered or no confirmation at all. Just left.  Try to avoid this place as much as you can.

The place doesn't give out receipts so why would you question me? The large gentlemen then grabbed my appetizer from the freezer with his bare hand no gloves and dropped them in the fryer. I  was one of maybe 4 dinning room orders. it was hard to even get my order taken. woman at counter was to busy and tried to summon someone for my order. finally an employee on break comes and takes my order. we had a larger party order a personal pizza and some fried appetizers. larger table taken by employee. friends waited 45 mins for a 12 in pizza and 2 apps. I had to inquire about my food. The gentlemen in front of us, 45 mins for a burger. food looked generic. service crappy. place isn't clean. GO ANYWHERE ELSE THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS",

This time 15 minutes pass so we hang up. We decide to call once more, this time they answer and ask what we want (the lady had a very bad attitude). We tell them we've been waiting for an hour and a half for our food. She says it will be deliver in 10 minutes. Now we're getting a little frustrated. We could've gone to the mcdonalds down the street and ate by now.  Lastly, we wait 20 minutes and the delivery guy finally calls and tells us to meet him at the regristration desk in the front of the hotel. You're kidding right? They asked for our room number and we gave it to them. Why couldnt they deliver to the room? What is the point of delivery if I still have to get off my comfy bed and walk half a mile to get my food? We paid $5 for delivery. The food was fair at best, rather cold and stale.   Pathetic.",

Best fries I've ever had, and the pizza was outstanding!  It's a great ma and pa place with very little seating but this made the experience ever better!  I will be back on my next Vegas stay!",

Looked like it had been tossed from the delivery man's moving vehicle, scooped up and put back in the box. $42 on pizza and $10 tip for the delivery guy, who had some serious balls handing us this crap. They brought us a new pizza after we called complaining. Same delivery driver....made sure we checked the pizza before he left this time. The driver was very rude. He accused us of dropping the pizza and when that didn't work he blamed his co-workers. The new pizza was tasteless, dry and had hardly any toppings. It was awful! Frozen pizza is better. Won't be calling this place again.",

    "text": "Super bad experience with the quality of food. After reading some of these reviews posted on Yelp I am convinced that they were left by friends or family of existing employees. It is a pizza place in the middle of a  Chinatown, that should have been my first clue. Nevertheless I am curious and exploring new options I went there ordered 16 inch pizza with 20 wings.   The price was bad at $29.99, keep in mind when I looked at my pizza it seemed like they were short on pepperoni and used an excessive amount of dough. I ordered mild and hot wings they look like they were almost plain they were stingy on the sauce I guess. I also ordered two sides of ranch that were the smallest cups I have ever seen I was very disappointed they charged me $0.50 for each one. Even knowing that I was unsure of my purchase before I paid I still continued what's the worst that could happen.   After being dissatisfied when eating the pizza I said I will never go there again. Hour and a half later feeling a terrible stomach pain beginning to think this place was a bad choice once again. Just warning you guys who are curious and exploring new places this place is not a New York style pizza like other fake reviews claim. This is one of the lowest quality pizzas I have ever tasted.   People you have been warned.....  Ps. To the staff that will hopefully read this review. Please step up the quality of your dough remember that less cheese and less pepperoni doesn't  mean savings, it means crappy Pizza.",

They charged me 6$ and some change because of the delivery fee thought ok cool understandable they charged for the extra pepperoni and ranch which I'm totally ok with my total came up to 86$. They tell me it's going to be an hour. Well it took them 1hr and 40 mins to get here I thought ok you know what it's okay things happen then my white pizza had NO pepperoni I thought ok well this sucks but whatever than they forgot to bring my order of wings! The driver had thee ordasity to say \"it's a far drive and no one wanted to come so I just grabbed whatever and left\" .  I am a server and I am very lenient when it comes to stuff like this but now I'm very upset ! I call the store and beside them being rude saying their bringing me wings they deny me from speaking to the manager. I told them I didn't want the food that could have everything back I just want a refund ! They said that no they can't do that blah blah blah the best they could do is 10% ! 10%are you kidding me you guys completely messed up my order gave me crappie ass service and only going to give 10% NO! I told them I'll pay for 1 pizza that got here right but that I should not pay for the pizza that is not completed or the wings that weren't even here yet. They said to call the next day and speak with the manager at 3:30 I've called and called and all they do is click on me nd tell me the manager isn't around! I well never in my life buy food from here again! I will definitely be telling everyone on FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM SNAPCHAT even the news if I have to about how horrible this place is!!!",

The order was completed over the phone at 8:40 pm, we were told it would be delivered from 1 hour- 1 hour 15 minutes.  We had not received our order over 2 hours later so we gave them a call and the woman on the phone advised us to give her 10 minutes to find the driver and our order and if he had not made it to us in 10 minutes to call her back and we did call back after we had not received our order 15 minutes later.  When we called back she was very rude and irate and asked us what we wanted to do because she did not know what happened to our order bc she had seen it leave the building and we were \"saying\" we did not receive it and now she was responsible for the order and they could not find the food or the driver and she would have to pay for our order out of her paycheck.  We told her that we were hungry and just wanted our order and she very rudely offered to make us a new order send it out and only waive the delivery fee but it would take 20 minutes to make and 10 or more to deliver.  The delivery guy finally showed up at about 11:30 pm with no apology.  We come here every year for WSOP and I will surely advise all of our associates not to ever do business with this place.",

Flamingo had slipped a flier under my hotel room door, so I called. Mistake. While the woman who took my order and the guy who delivered my food were both very friendly, the food was pretty disappointing. The fried apps were all soggy and mushy when they arrived, and the Chicken Picatta was bland and flavorless. They were out of rice so I said fettuccine noodles were okay, but they brought sad, overcooked spaghetti noodles instead. The tiramisu was still frozen when I finished my meal and tasted it. The meal was supposed to come with a salad, but that was missing. And the \"2 liter bottle\" of soda I got was actually 355ml. Oh, and the garlic bread was flavorless and soggy. Basically, the only thing that didn't suck was the service (and the bottled water).",

    "text": "Stayed at a suite at the Hilton Grand Vacation by stratosphere. They were slipping their menu's under all the doors, and there was no room service menu so we decided to order some pizza around 8:00-8:30. Ordered the #10 which was two pizzas, 36 wings, and a 2-liter. After an hour and a half I called to check on our order. The girl that answered asked me to hold when I told her I ordered an hour and a half ago. Then she picked up the phone again and forgot I was on hold, told me the delivery would be out shortly. I figured that maybe it was a busy night so not too upset about the wait until the food finally arrived about 15 minutes after the phone call. Both pizzas were cold. Crust was like cardboard, cheese like plastic. Barely any toppings on pizza. Ordered BBQ wings, and they basically cooked some plain wings and put a few squirts of BBQ sauce on them. Not tossed or anything. This combo was $61.99, I recommend just about any other pizza place over this. Pizza Hut, dominos, papa john's, little Caesar's, Costco, digorno, hot pockets... not worth the $, save yourself.",

Upon walking in, I was hesitant because it smelled like there was a plumbing issue and the lady taking orders was 'weird' (I'll keep it at that). Suprisingly, the pizza and wings were great and the price wad decent. Came hot and was everything I asked for. I'd recommend! (4 stars for appearance issues)",

    "text": "I really like this pizza joint. At first it seems like any restaurant where you could get just a slice of pizza from but one look at the menu and you will see that this place has everything from calzones to tiramisu. I was thoroughly impressed. The food is top notch and I don't plan on going anywhere else for pizza ever again. Being a Las Vegas native, I love supporting local businesses. I even met the owner the last time I went there with a coworker and he was a genuine guy who cared about his craft and the people who came to his business.",

    "text": "If I could give negative stars I would. Waited nearly two hours for a pizza that I ordered. When it got here I asked the delivery guy why it took so long. He said in broken English that was barely understandable \" cuz we is the only place open\". I know this to be 100% False because I ordered delivery almost every weekend at the same time. To make things worse I opened the pizza box once inside after paying the confused man and had received the wrong pizza. I had ordered and paid for extra pepperoni and I received a cold, paper thin, cheese pizza. After contacting yelp services I am stuck in a battle between yelp 24, this shit pizza place, and customer service waiting hours for a \"manager\".  Whatever you do if you read this do NOT order from here. So many better options in the area. Also never and I mean NEVER trust a company that has yelp 24 as their delivery. YELP I would like my 35 dollars back. Will be blasting this on every social media sites until money is returned.",

    "text": "Ordered from Eat24 last night. Of course being Christmas, there was not a big choice. I read all the reviews and thought this would be good. WRONG! I am shocked at the four and five stars. The pizza was 2 hours late, that didn't bother me as much because of the holiday but it was ice cold and soggy crust. We ordered a 16 inch pepperoni and mushroom pizza and there was not much of it! Also ordered a Caesar salad.  The lettuce was wilted and very small portion for the price. The spaghetti was overcooked and marina tasted like it was from a can that need water added.  This was not cheap. I could understand you get what you pay for but for over 40 dollars, I truly would have been more satisfied with little Caesars-which. Is not high on my list! Very disappointed.",
