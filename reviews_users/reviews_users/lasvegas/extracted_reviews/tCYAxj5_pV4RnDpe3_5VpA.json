    "text": "LOVE this place!!! I always do the AYCE and have yet to complain.  They have the BEST menu selection.  I have friends who don't really do the sushi thing, but their appetizer/cooked food menu offers more than just chicken teriyaki.  So, everyone is happy.  Their fish is fresh, the rolls are delicious (try the Sweet Tomato), and the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated.  The best part...lunch is only $21 and dinner is $26.  They also have a stamp card system - free ayce after 10 stamps.    As for all the complaints on the waiters...I haven't had an issue. You'd be surprised how far a genuine smile will take you =]",

My husband and I tried it a week ago while we were in the area and weren't impressed with the nigiri. The service was fast and the rolls fine, but the nigiri was cut so thin that all I could taste was rice. We did all you can eat, but I gave up quickly because it wasn't worth it. I was hoping this would be my new sushi place since it's close to my house, but not so much.",

Ridiculously unyielding. Will not add or substitute anything. For instance, they have an avocado asparagus roll yet will not add either to a menu item.  Had a couple people in our party ordering ayce and a younger teenager ordering ala cart. The appetizer portions are different sizes depending on how you order. The waitress freaked when the teenager started eating the wrong order.........didn't make sense, especially since the ayce order was smaller!!!  Sasa Sushi is just a few miles down the road, a place where the staff is waaay more friendly and they aren't worried about customizing an order for you.",

I used to almost on a weekly basis order a shrimp tempura roll and gladly pay the ten bux for that one roll because it was so satisfying. The last few times I have gone, stuff has tasted weird and I get the skinniest rolls with almost no topping on them. I am really bummed becasue it is right up the street from me, but I don't care to spend my money or time getting mediocre food and service. The chefs used to be so friendly and now they seem annoyed which really affects food quality",

And by far I have one of the worst experiences in a very long time. So we Hager there at 9 pm and hour prior closing and the told us that we only have 30 min. To order. So we ordered apps. And told the waitress to tell us when last call is so we can order sushi. We got AYCE $27 which is expensive for a neighborhood restaurant. But we all though I has to be really good......well it wasn't! All you can eat doesn't include a lot! Of things like most AYCE include. We were rushes the whole hour we were there...they did not bring every we ordered and at the end they still rushed us out and it wasn't 10pm yet. Truthfully I will never be back again and I will tell anybody on my neighborhood of the experienced we all had.",

The number of options that they have with california rolls is astounding. I have not encountered one thing I didn't like on the menu yet, either.   The only trouble I have ever had here is when I showed up late. I thought they were open for another hour. I got the buffet option and then only had 15 minutes to eat it all up. I was hoping they would cut me some slack, but no, they had to get going. Not entirely their fault, I know. Would have been nice to have had a few extra minutes to dine though.",

We didn't feel pressured, but we did both order the all you can eat and were aware of the 50 minute time. The menu changed a bit since the last time we were here and they altered a few names so ordering with a little confusing. The menu change seems like they added a lot of new items, which is great. Our orders came out pretty quickly, but we should have taken advantage of the half order rolls at the end since we were stuffed and felt pressure to clean our plates (our fault for ordering a bunch at once). Our favorites were the crunchy rice with salmon, Wild West, super white, tuna poke, monkey brains, and Mojave beach roll. The worst was the New Mexican roll, the habanero sauce was good and super spicy, but such an odd flavoring with the cilantro. We had mochi ice cream (coffee and cookies and cream), which were delicious even though we were so stuffed! Lunch was $21.",

It was obvious because the people around us were all getting service.  It's like they were purposely slowing down the service.  The bigger issue was we ordered sea bass and it took over 30 minutes to come.  Again it's coming don't worry we placed the order.  Insult to injury when it finally came only two of the three orders came.  The waitress then tried to prove to me she placed an order for three.  I mean come on how hard is to say we're sorry we messed up.  But no they made excuse after excuse.  And then at the end no one came to our table.  It was so pathetic.   Will never go back and I caution you if they think you might be eating more than two rolls then you might get their slow and go service.  Which I am convinced is intentional.

This is what drew me to the place. I am a big sushi person and usually eat AYCE 1-2 times a week. I really don't eat rolls and enjoy Nigiri. With that said, after a few visits I noticed that if you order a few rounds of Nigiri, they will start joking in Japanese and making faces, and start slacking on the service. Since it's a family business they just let it slide. They also never have cold glasses for beer, so unless you like luke warm beer with your sushi, the $3 drafts are more of a chore to drink, than a compliment to the good food. If you enjoy a roll or two and want to pay $26 for AYCE then this is your place. If you want to eat your fill of good quality AYCE, there are plenty more that offer high quality fish and offer great service without the sarcasm that makes you just want to leave on an empty stomach. Sapporo Revolving Sushi offers a great Happy Hour, cold Beer, and fresh fish. Goyeman has always provided all the above and great service that will cater to your needs, and also has a loyalty program.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EXPLAINED: I was in the area, so I tried Sushi Bomb for a second time (first time did not go well either) with friends and our kids.  Major disappointment. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! Their AYCE sushi was a little pricey but it was Sunday late afternoon, and we knew the AYCE dinner price was still a value. The kids meal also seemed like a good value. NOTE: Hot green tea was NOT included for $27.99 per AYCE adult sushi which seemed strange to me. We were told right away to order ALL of our sushi at once because they would NOT otherwise be able to make it without us waiting up to 25 minutes for each order... WHAT? That is NOT how \"All You Can Eat\" is supposed to work. We all felt cheated because of the time delay between our ordering and receiving our food. This needs to be fixed Sushi Bomb! Hire more sushi chefs and servers (there must have been around 75 people in this little restaurant and it looked like only THREE servers). THEN THEY GOT OUR ORDER WRONG, forgot items (I never did get my blue fin tuna nigiri), had to replace items with other choices (even though the fish we wanted was an advertised item on the table display), served us COLD HOT GREEN TEA (which took over 10 minutes to get replaced) they mistakenly put my last specialty roll on another table so I had to WAIT LONGER to get it after they tried to influence me to cancel the order (as we were at the end of our dinner)... The food quality was okay UNTIL THEY SERVED THE GOLDEN SCALLOPS, which WERE NOT EVEN SCALLOPS AT ALL!! The \"Golden Scallops\" were made with FAKE CRAB MEAT (they later admitted to us that it was fish cake, but I know what the imitation crab meat looks and tastes like), which were OVER-BREADED in a flavorless, over-fried very hard coating... YUCK!!! Gross!!! We asked for a discount as our check for this experience was almost $200 for 3 adults and 3 kids, and were only given ONLY $12 off... why that amount, I could not tell you, but we agreed that at least it was some amount taken off of the check.  I will NEVER RETURN to Sushi Bomb. I did not enjoy it. We finally paid and left, but this bad experience was not over yet...  After all of this, I unfortunately felt victimized by Sushi Bomb as they squeezed in SO MANY TABLES in that place that I could not walk through to the exit without knocking stuff off of one of their tables... which is HUMILIATING and MUST BE A FIRE HAZARD!!! (I wish I had taken pictures to post, but I did not... if so you could see the \"Golden Scallops\" horror... )",

    "text": "I watched this place being built in my neighborhood when it was first coming to fruition and we were all so excited about having a sushi restaurant in the north west especially when it's slim pickings in this area Of great places to eat without having to drive down the hill on Cheyenne and of course this is before downtown Summerlin graced us with its presence. --it used to be fantastic.   The music was fun, and they even had a ladies night and they were open till 3 AM with a reverse happy hour into the late hours. It was phenomenal .  ...not only have we spent birthdays and numerous graduations since they opened obviously they have changed hands since then.   The food has always been good the service always has been impeccable and it's always been quite comfortable.   Until today. Someone formerly mentioned in our review recently that the service is all over the place and indeed it is. I sat down as I waited for my son to join me who was coming straight from work I was there about five minutes and barely had a sip of my water when I was approached by one of the head waiters and asked when my \"party or a partner or friend\" was arriving. I had barely put my purse down. I told him soon in about two minutes later my son arrived. Said waiter came back and took her order the food arrived promptly which was great and it was also delicious barely a bite into my salmon skin hand roll , which was greasy.and mediocre at best, and the waiter appeared again asking \"what else were having for our second round,\" ...well I have a full mouth of food and have barely started enjoying my dinner, so I don't know if there will be a second round .... I just want to enjoy my dinner and the company I am with.   He obviously has had no social skills or tact when he waits on tables he was quite rude and pushy and honestly I have to say this is been happening for quite a while I've had this chubsy waiter before and he was pretty much a jerk ....there was about six people waiting on us.  It definitely doesn't have that personal neighborhood flare that it used to have. it almost seems like a assembly line of sushi which is really disappointing because I remember what it used to be like when it first opened. Which is really too bad because this is around the corner from my house and it really used to be our place to go. I thunk Sishi Kota has won over my business. It's far but I feel appreciated and don't mind paying for great service and great food, I work hard and deserve both.  Do t we all?",

The sushi is good quality, especially for being in Las Vegas, and what you are going to pay.  I have never gotten sick from here, and I keep going back to take that for what it is worth.   I think they have very good specialty rolls, and there is a lot of selection available to you. I also really like that I can order half orders of rolls when doing AYCE to that I can sample more types of rolls.   They have a good selection of everything you could need/want for a sushi night.   The place is smaller, but there is plenty of seating.  It does get crowded so if you are going during a high time, you will likely need to wait a little bit.   The only reason it is 4 not 5 is mainly the service.  it is not bad, but not stellar either.   I will continue to go back, and if you are in the area I would give it a shot.",

While waiting I also witnessed the waiter deliver the wrong roll to 2 wrong tables, and when he realized his mistake he picked up the rolls from the wrong tables and served them to the correct people We left after waiting at the table and when I called them to let them know what happened the tall waitress answered and said she couldn't help us because it wasn't her section. Stay away!! Their nigiri is poor quality and will make you sick So mad at myself for trying to give them a second chance. Beware!",

Their AYCE pricing is not bad...$18ish for lunch and $25ish for dinner.  Otherwise, the rolls al carte is reasonably priced. $7-$13.  They also have an great promo going right now if you go with friends--buy 2 AYCE and get 1 free.   Try the Love Me Long Time roll.  One of my favorites!  The staff is friendly,  fast service, and the restaurant is very clean. I love that they are open till 1am on Saturday nights.    **Fun side note: if you sit at the sushi bar,  they have this really cool toy box.  You put a quarter there and a cat comes out of the box to take it--hilariously cute.",

This has to be the best feeling ever, the fact that they remember us and care enough to begin to prepare our favorite dish is awesome!  Thats how it starts, let me tell you how it ends. Next we order! More Salmon Sushi! Check! A some some roll. Check! Salmon cheese sticks. Check! Baja Yellowtail roll. Check! Throw in some Salmon hand rolls. Double Check!! Rinse and repeat until full! We do the All You Can Eat, its so worth it.  Our favorite servers? You ask.  Hmmm  let me think. Gots to be a tie between Paul or Danny.   Pauls got the hair, but Danny is always on it. Its truly a tie between them, they are both great.   Now the bad, peak times like friday nights or saturday nights get a little hectic.

When it was brought to the table he proceeded to eat it and then was promptly told he wasn't allowed to eat it because he wasn't doing all you can eat so when he told the server that he did order it she said \"Well it's supposed to be larger than that\" and then the server told the rest of the table that we would have to eat it. Why should we have to eat someone else's half eaten sea bass when the server was the one that put in the wrong order? She literally wouldn't let him eat the smaller portion and made him wait until his new order arrived. What kind of place does that? Another guest ordered a roll without cream cheese and when it came with cream cheese the server didn't apologize. Even if it was the sushi chefs fault the server should normally apologize on the chefs behalf with a simple \"Oh sorry about that.\" All in all the food was alright, nothing special. The wait after ordering was terribly long. There are so many other options for sushi in this town I would look elsewhere for your dining needs.",

It has improved over the last few years and it seems like the owners are running a smart business model and reinvesting in the establishment. They have expanded the menu more then once and updated the tables and chairs, light fixtures, etc. The fish is always fresh and well tempered. The all you can eat deal is competitive with other places ($27/person for dinner). If my husband liked sushi as much as I do we would eat here 3 times per week!",

I liked that when I went here last, some of our family members got to do a la carte instead of forcing the whole table to do AYCE.   The salmon nigiri is perfectly marbled and fresh it just melts in my stomach. They let you order half rolls which is just enough for tasting everything on the menu.   Highly recommended for those who live on the west side of vegas (this is on Cheyenne and 215) if you're too lazy or tired to drive all the way to the south side, strip, or Chinatown for some good sushi.",

The only reason that I didn't rate it perfect is due to average shrimp tempura and less attentive waitress. You do need to catch their attention if you need anything.

They don't take reservations but you can call and tell them what time you'll be there and they'll put your name down at that time so we didn't have to wait too long. That was cool.   It is one of the more expensive all-you-can-eat prices at $27 but they did have a great selection and the sushi was fresh and tasty unlike some AYCE places. They also had on a daily special a Chilean sea bass ,it was amazing. Sucked that we didn't notice it till after we were full but we ordered it anyways. Couldnt pass that up. They also have, if you get the AYCE, Sapporo on draft for $3!   Our service was good. And the people were nice. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was freezing in there. they said it was something about keeping the fish Fresh,which we were like, well why is it any other sushi place freezing then? It did end up getting turned down halfway through our meal. Thank goodness.  Also, the music was  quite loud making it hard to hear each other. Would definitely come back here.",

We were eating and enjoying our food with our companies - not loud,  not picky, or being a trouble maker. Other two severs,  a young boy and a young girl,  are great though - taking care of drinks and emtry plates away with great customer service. Food is all right.   After we ordered the 2nd round,  the attitude fat asian server, she came and said ''oh you know the policy right! (Look at my friend) yeah,  you know. We charge for left over\" Then walked away! We were looking at each other like,  \"what was that!\" But we did not think it was a big deal.   After the 2nd round of food were served, we were eating. Then she stopped for the second time and said,  \"you must eat all of rice too!\" Then walked away.  What?!?!  Really!!!,  she needed to do that again. We did not ask your policy or had a lot of food on the plate! Now, we felt like she hated us for a reason as we were specificlly threaten to charge more.   FYI: we finished the 1st set of order and were still eating our 2nd round of food. It is normal that some rice or ingredients were dropped on the plate as some sushi is loose or too big to the mouth. We did not have bunch of rice or food left over in the plate neither. We have been eating all you can eat sushi at many restuarants in Las Vegas and many cities for years and never had a server came and threated us in my whole life. This was a wow...   She might be a manager or partner so she has a ball to say that to us. It is very rude and inappropriate!! If she would charge me for a piece of rice,  go head and I don't mind to pay. If I don't have money to spend,  i wouldn't go there and eat at your restaurant. Don't need to be attitude and thread a customer like this! So unprofessional and lack of customer service.",

    "text": "Bukake!  hehehehe!  :P  That's a roll they offer, I don't really know what it means.    Now on to the review.  Maybe my expectations were high because of their location or the price I saw on their dinner AYCE (all you can eat) at $27 but I was dissapointed.  I ordered my usual nigiri first and I got three orders of tuna, two orders of salmon, one order of garlic tuna, one order of scallops to start.  They were out of Uni!  I would rather they be out of uni rather than serve me some bad or foul uni like some other places.  When they brought out my nigiri, all of them were on the same plate which meant the garlic tuna sauce contaminated the rice on the other nigiri.  While my friend and I were eating, I noticed that they kept the rolls and other nigiri on a counter and wouldn't deliver the food you ordered out right away.  I think they were trying to keep a nice eating tempo but I'd rather they bring all of the dish out right away, especially if they were baked or hot orders!  Have to take a star off for that.  The server didn't take our order on a piece of paper so we didn't get all the rolls or items we ordered.  That's why I like how some places have those papers where you can jot down what you want.  Another dissapointment.    Mind you there were only 2 other customers at the time so I expected service to be immaculate.  As far as the nigiri goes, I think they noticed that I caught on to the amount of rice that was given and they used a dab too much rice vinegar.  On my second order of nigiri, I had two orders of tuna, one order of salmon, sweet shrimp, oysters (you can only have one order), and two orders of salmon roe.  The portions were finally the way I liked it with the fish covering the rice and not the rice looking like a nice comfy bean bag for my fish to sleep comfortably on.  The freshness of the fish is good, they've got that right.    After I eat about 30 pieces of nigiri I go on to the rolls, but I like to order half rolls which I've been spoiled by other sushi places that allow it.  They don't allow it here.  So take note of that!  They have some funny names for their rolls.  I ordered two rolls (which could have been 4 half rolls...) and one of them being some secret eel roll which I did not enjoy at all because the center was spicy tuna.  I thought it would have been all eel.  My friend ordered some other roll which had a puffy creamy ball top which was bland.  I had to help her clean up her rolls because she didn't enjoy it.  We were actually thankful that they didn't get our orders right because the rolls were not headed towards the right direction.  I had one good roll which had a shrimp tempura middle but I would have rather ordered 10 more pieces of nigiri instead of that eel secret special roll.    You can only order one dessert per AYCE and even though I had great company and we still had a great time eating okay food.  They have drink specials and one other thing they have going for them is the beer special that accompanies the AYCE.  Drinking wise this place would be the bomb.",

    "text": "Ugh, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!  Me and a girlfriend would always come here for good sushi when Sushi Kaya down in Chinatown started to fall off (they've recovered) and Sushi Bomb was always so good! Something happened recently where they took a lot of the rolls I loved, off the menu. We would always go inside and eat for lunch or dinner. It was a hit or miss. The food was always on point which is great, but the service in there was always horrid. Sometimes we'd wait 15 minutes before our waters were refilled in a restaurant of only 3 small filled tables. Unacceptable  There was even a day when every single table was not bussed of the previous diner's dishes that we had no choice but to sit at the bar and then new customers wouldn't have anywhere to sit! It was gross being surrounded by plates and half eaten food.   So, I started getting it to go. The food was still good I just didn't want to deal with the in house situation. Well they've managed to disappoint me there too. It's always hard to order take out when the restaurant doesn't have a website or a current menu posted anywhere online. I always a specific roll and the past three times they've forgotten the sauce that goes on top. Last time they also forgot the ginger and wasabi. (which I actually use)   NOW, all that being said, I somehow still recommend it. They've expanded their menu a bit and have a lot of options besides just sushi. Good to take kids to, people that don't like raw fish, and good for groups. Maybe it's just the time I go, but it looks look a couple staff members may have changed. BUT if you do take out, I'd recommend that you tell them to keep your food in a fridge because they will leave it right at the register if you show up 15, 20, or 30 minutes after it's prepared. Raw fish+room temp= a big no no.",

We later saw her deliver salad to the couple next to us. They used to have a Korean Lasagna and ?Volcano roll.  Not on the menu anymore...probably too much work or $$, but the sushi chefs that were there when it was a menu item, were there that night.

    "text": "Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!  So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.  Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything.   Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions.   Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.  So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message! Im still trying to get the hang of eating sushi! Thanks Sushi Bomb for being gentle!",

We each had three rolls. I had a Dragon Roll, LA BBQ Roll, and a specialty spicy tuna roll (I have forgotten the name.) All the rolls were very good and fresh. The AYCE wasn't too bad $27, and they had a lot of things that we didn't have room to try.   The staff are very attentive, we had multiple people willing to put our order in, checking on our drinks, and making suggestions on what we may like. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. Only gave 4 stars because it didn't blow me away, but it was definitely a very good place to visit.",

When one of the waiters came by with the other sushi I ordered, I attempted to show him the roll with the hair still in it. He wouldn't give me the time of day. Asked if I ordered the roll he was holding. I attempted to show him the hair & let him know I didn't want the roll or any of his food. A girl came over & she didn't care about the hair either. I don't have a problem paying for my food, but I'm disappointed they didn't care, there was no apology, they left the rest of my table alone, and they charged me for the first roll. Super disappointed. The service wasn't great either, usually isn't but I overlook it taking into consideration that they get busy. Not my problem! Won't ever go back there.",

It has cooked shrimp both inside, outside and avocado on top with eel sauce. The spicy deep fried jalapeno one is also a stand out.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the mochi. It always has a taste about it that I'm not fond of. As if it hasn't been separated from the garlic or other seasonings in the freezer. Other than that.... Spot on.",

    "text": "Pros:  Good food, AYCE.  Cons:  Awful horrible service.  Honestly my FIRST negative review on Yelp.  The service was that bad that I could not let it go and to inform others. Literally read reviews from 2 months ago complaining about the same thing.  Let me preface that we came in a whole hour before closing which is decent time to order and eat, so I understood that last call for food was 30 min before closing.  Our server was just impatient, rude, and unhappy.  It was to the point I almost wanted to have her sit down and breath and talk about why it seems she hates her job so much to make the customers feel so uncomfortable and awkward.  The sushi men behind the bar we're irritated and unhappy, as if they we're pissed we came in since they seemed they wanted to close up early and go home.  It just felt we we're a burden to the whole staff.  We wished we could have left earlier, after an $80 bill for 2 people with poor service, I didn't want to even tip. Everyone is in customer service in some way, no need to be so unpleasant to people who want to have a nice dinner.  I MIGHT give a 2nd chance to see if there is any improvement, but honestly would rather drive the extra 7 miles to Chinatown for better service than have that experience again.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  The bad service just trumps the good food.. honestly that ridiculous.  Recommendation to management:  Please properly train your staff to wait on tables in a friendly manner, not in a \"hurry up and eat you food\" type of way.    Customers, you have been warned.",

We opted not to get the ayce and ordered a la carte, which always seems to make the rolls bigger and meatier. We had the red rock, caterpillar, white rabbit (that was our fav), and a spicy tuna hand roll. The bill was just over $50. I may go back.",

    "text": "Pretty good AYCE sushi here on my side of town!  There aren't very many sushi joints in the NW for us to partake in, especially of the AYCE variety.  I can probably count a small handful of places, and not all of them warrant a repeat visit.  I'm happy to say Sushi Bomb is a great option for AYCE sushi near us!    I gotta be honest though, out of all the various rolls we ate...I cannot remember the names of any of them!  I forgot to take a good pic of the actual menu!  All I can tell you is the night the wifey & I were at Sushi Bomb we ate good.  Stuffed to the gills good.  While Sushi Bomb is not one of my top places for AYCE sushi, it's up there with a more than enjoyable place to go.  We went for dinner on a Friday night (payday, yay), and even at 8 PM the place was lively with a lot of patrons...lots of kids too!  I know it's not considered KOSHER, but my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants are the ones that also offer a number of non-sushi appetizers to go with dinner.  Not traditional, but I like having a break from the endless amounts of rice that come your way with ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  Some of the apps we tried:  -Chilean Sea Bass (daily special) - this was sooo good! -Chicken Yakitori  As a rule of thumb - for sushi rolls at an AYCE place we usually stick to the higher priced items on the menu.  Why get a Cali Roll from the menu if you really don't have to?  Come on...live a little!  Try that soft shell crab!  Get some crispy salmon skin!  Sample that extra spicy tuna!  We got a nice selection of Sushi Bomb's special rolls, tempura rolls, chef special rolls, and baked rolls.    Honestly, from what I remember they were all tasty!  I know it doesn't help that it wasn't all that memorable, but at least for us the quality was there.  The rice to fish ratio was on spot, there wasn't too much rice.  And their sushi rice was very good too - not gummy or overly sticky.  For myself, I love those baked rolls.  Something about the warm mayo mix that comes from under the salamander, just makes a roll delicious.  Wifey on the other hand though hates warm mayo with a passion...ha ha ha!  AYCE also comes with a dessert per person.  But this was pretty forgettable because the desserts we got were not on par with the food earlier:  -Honey Toast -Tempura Banana   If you see the pictures, both desserts look the same!  Covered in a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  The Honey Toast was terrible!  It literally was a Hawaiian sweet bread roll cut in half and baked for a few minutes to make it somewhat toasty.  The Tempura Banana wasn't much better, heavy on the batter and thin on the banana.  I would skip dessert the next time or just get a scoop of ice cream to finish the meal.  Dinner is about $28 a person before tax, average with other AYCE sushi places in town.  Service was OK, but a bit rushed I think because for the AYCE you are limited to 1 hour.  There was enough time though to order another round of rolls though so I wouldn't worry too much unless you have a huge party.  We'll give Sushi Bomb another try...next time I'll be sure to remember all those rolls!",

The saddest part of my visit was that they no longer have the all you can drink draft beer as an add on for all you can eat.  To be honest that's one of the main reasons we would all come here, because who wants to pay $7 for ONE beer when you can pay $4.99 for all you can drink draft Sapporo?! Nobody, that's who!   Needless to say, I probably won't be frequenting this location anymore. There's plenty of other good sushi restaurants with cheaper AYCE and alcohol specials.

All of their fish is fresh and delicious. The customer service is amazing. I love when a 1HR AYCE place actually is attentive so you don't have to order everything at once because they will always be around to check up on you!",

    "text": "First off, id like to start off by saying I NEVER come on yelp to complain, generally, I am always giving out excellent reviews, but this experience was BEYOND unacceptable I felt I needed to share. First and foremost my family comes to sushi bomb OFTEN at least 3 times a month. My mom asked me to go with to try out the place. We had 13 people total and out of the 13, 10 of us were all you can eat, our bill was over 400 dollars. AYCE for almost 30 dollars a piece was definitely not worth it when you can find it cheaper with WAY better service. The service here was literally by far the worst service I have ever received at a sushi restaurant! My son is only 3 years old and they took a while to bring out his sushi so he took ONE and I mean ONE piece of my sushi and they literally came up to me and told me he cannot share off of me. Seriously, how much can a 3 year old eat from my plate? I ordered him his entire own roll but it was taking a while to come and I'm not going to sit there and watch my son starve as we are all eating. After that, they also scolded my 7 year old who ate 3 edamames from my sisters AYCE. Seriously 3 edamames. It was honestly so disrespectful. And to top it off, they wanted to charge us for 6 pieces of sushi that was left out of 10 AYCE!!! Seriously??? The bill is over 400 bucks and you want to charge us over 6 pieces of uneaten sushi? That is absolutely ridiculous. My husband was forced to eat the last 6 pieces and literally came home and vomited. Another thing that upset me was that I guess they have 2 dollar draft Sapporo for AYCE. They failed to tell us that until the very end after we had ordered 30 dollars in regular Sapporo not knowing the draft was INCREDIBLY cheaper. They're money hungry and don't care at all about service, only the money they can take from your pocket. It's ridiculous the way they treated me and my family considering the amount we were spending plus 18% tip. They need waaay better service. Sushi was ok, just like every other place here in Vegas, nothing OUT OF THIS WORLD, by any means. Take your money else where with better service and better sushi. Also waitresses jasmine and jen were incredibly disrespectful and need to reconsider their positions as waitresses. They have lost a total of 18 people's business! Way to go sushi bomb",

We moved to the NW side of town recently, and decided to give Sushi Bomb a try due to its proximity to our home-- and we couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised! The fish was not only fresh, but it's one of the few places in town that offer super white (my fave!) Our waiter was super friendly, and very helpful with the menu. He offered his opinion on some of their popular rolls, all of which were amazing. Even the dessert menu was unique and offered different options than what we are used to (I went for the deep friend banana split- DELICIOUS!) Great spot, great service, great experience. We will be returning!",

    "text": "I arrived having to request to order my appetizer after 15 min of waiting, dining alone I did get ignored . I requested to order again to order the sushi part of my order. After 25 min a very small order of combo tempura arrived but not my other 2 hot items, miso soup and pork goyza. I was puzzled since the menu listed the number of items in the appetizer order and my order was very small. After 30 of waiting I asked where my hot food was and a young lady not my waiter said she would check. About 5 min later she brought out goyza 3 pieces but menu says 6. I found this odd again so I asked and I was told the all you can eat is smaller portions of appetizers. Hmm I'm hungry waiting in my food, all you can eat offers smaller quantity of appetizer which I'm hungry and wondering why when I'm paying AYCE price....anyway after 40 min mark my tempura rolls came, shrimp tempura I liked and the other choice I made I did not like but the waiter told me he would charge me for 'leftovers' if I left it but I told him I didn't like it and he threatened to charge me extra on top of the $29 price tag for the all you can eat and at this point I have barely eaten anything. 3 pieces of combo tempura , 3 pieces of goyza after 40 min and 1 shrimp tempura roll. I asked him are you forcing me to eat it? Heck I already committed to AYCE price, that $30 price tag is pretty steep for just a few items. Very unfair business practice to double charge me when they are getting $30 for a dinner AYCE anyway and the reason I'm leaving this on yelp is the fact I asked for the manager after the waiter acknowledged they forgot my soup and goyza and no manager, I was waiting while I was paying assuming a manager would come and after being in the establishment for 60 minutes I had to leave to get home to my family! How sad no one asked how they can make it better or get something I might like instead what unfair business practice !",

One of the rules is you must finish everything or you get charger full price. Makes sense since some people will order everything and eat half of it. Japanese lasagna is awesome. Tuna poke with seaweed salad was very good as well. Dessert options are many, only complaint was you get 1 mochi only. Should get at least 2",

We told her it was our first time here and needed to look through the menu. She came back and informed us the kitchen will close soon! It is not even 10:30p yet!! We ordered a few things and it came out fast. The fish was ok, nothing to rave about. The seaweed salad had a strong vinegar taste, not to my liking. We had to order everything by 10:30p and felt rush finishing everything up because they had to close up shop by 11p.

So after class on a Thursday, around 10p, we decided to give this place a shot.  Located around at Cheyenne and 215. It was quiet when we arrived, only 2 other girls at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs and a server on duty. Everyone was really nice. They recommended the S&H Roll and we also ordered the Kimono Roll. Both of which are cream cheese rolls so it's kinda heavy, but DELICIOUS!! Comes with a little salad with their dressing in the center. Just hit the spot.  Also tried their yellowtail roll and scallop sushi. Scallops were big but not too fresh (I usually only get them when I am in Cali) and the yellowtail was okay, not really a fan.  What I am a fan of is their dessert! They have plum flavored ice cream! (Photo added) we had plum tempura ice cream. YUM! There's chunks of plum in the ice cream.   Service was awesome, food was great, ambiance was nice, good location for me. Great place. Must check it out.  I plan to return regularly when I am not dieting :)",

    "text": "Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, I wanted to find a different place to eat sushi for evening other than my usual sushi bar.  Since this place is somewhat near our house, we stopped in for an early dinner.  The bar area is quite nice, overall decor very comforting and natural.  I loved the fact that the place was basically all ours for the hour we were there.  The menu is great--simple and with some great options done differently.  Their amaebi, for example, includes the deep fried fish heads along with the two pieces of sushi.  I personally love sucking on a few shrimp heads, because that's where all the flavor is.  It was great.  We ordered all the yakitori skewers, 4 types, and it came with 2 skewers each.  Thinking they were the small yakitori, we didn't think it would be a lot to order for dinner. Oh my.  These skewers are pretty big, so majority of our dinner were the appetizers.  It was great!  The sauce was yummy and the meats were cooked well.  As for the shrimp ones, I didn't eat the shrimp.  I feel that shrimp should ALWAYS be cleaned because that black line is poop, and I don't eat poop.  That was a no-no for me, and therefore a deduction of 1 star on my review.  As for the rest, we tried their sushi, all perfectly portioned and the fish was great.  Their sauces are very good at this restaurant, everything from their cucumber salad, tempura dip, to the sauce they put on their yellowtail.  Oh and their tempura is crispy and light, too.  We loved it.  I think this place, despite its location being right next to the 215 on W. Cheyenne, is a really good sushi bar.  We plan to go back this week to try the rest of the menu.  If you want a road trip within city limits, try this place.  I know that they serve the same special rolls as any other sushi bar, but their sauces and talent make for a great night.  Plus their website says that it's 20% off after 9pm to midnight.    Great sushi, excellent service, and I'll definitely be back for more.",

Unfortunately, because the food is so good, this is a place where people really come to eat & almost everyone goes for the AYCE(all you can eat) No time limit option.... you know what that means- the Tables don't turn over that fast, but it is so worth the wait, if you had bad timing.  If you have 2 other friends with you, you have to go grab a bite, after 9PM, when it is buy 2 AYCE & get the 3rd FREE! There is also a $4 All You Can Drink: Draft Beer, if you get the AYCE, THAT'S INSANE! 1 Sapporo cost at least $5 everywhere else!",

This is our convenient go-to neighborhood sushi joint - perfect for after work noshing without having to drive too far. Although, like everything else in Vegas, it's in a suburban strip mall - the interior is well done - with wood paneled walls with large paintings of koi and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The glass tiled wall behind the sushi bar gives it a bit of hip chic.  We've always felt the food is good here. Sure - the waitress will always make the obligatory joke when you ask for a \"Kiss My Ass\" roll - and like so many sushi bars in town, everything has a somewhat dirty name. I have to admit, I don't find this trend particularly appealing, but whatev.  Last night the two of us split the aforementioned Kiss My Ass, the Red Tiger roll, Veggie Roll, and garlic tuna nigiri chased down with a house saki and a large Kirin. A new roll for us, The Red Tiger, is shrimp tempura and avocado wrapped in spicy tuna with a garlic sauce which is amazing. A new favorite. We don't do the AYCE because it isn't worth it for us - we can't eat that much!   Service was peppy and good as usual. Sometimes they can get a little spacey during a rush - but it's a cute spacey.",

Deep fried this crunchy that.  I like sashimi and vegetables in my rolls.   I ordered salmon sashimi and two rolls.  The sashimi was great-just like butter.  The spicy tuna was good-not too spicy thank goodness.  The Wild Wild west have cream cheese in it but I still found it to be quite tasty.

It's the only sushi spot we come too but a young slim female server we get is a little annoying, not sure of her name because she has never told us the way the others do. We always do all you can eat, and every time she reminds us more than once that whatever we don't eat we will pay for. Yes, we understood the first two times and don't need to be told multiple times. It's just annoying because we always finish our food and don't need to be constantly reminded to do so. That's the reason for 3 stars because I just cannot stand her customer service. Everyone else is great.",

We did 95% nigiri and I have zero complaints. It was a great birthday dinner. We will return.",

    "text": "What can I say about Sushi Bomb? Besides that it is by far our favorite local spot! We have tried many other places, but non can compare to the service, the prices, and most importantly the flavors! Their All-You-Can-Eat is my thing go-to on the menu. It's $21 12pm-3pm and then $27 from 3pm till close. One of the best parts about it, is you can order half rolls, instead of a whole one. Which gives you many more options to eat. Our ultimate favorite is \"THE LOVE AFFAIR\"! It's a baked goodness! Highly recommended! Their Miso soup comes in traditional style and my fav is the Miso with Crab Meat. Their Bacon and Scallops skewers are soooo flavorful, you'll want to order more. So, this is definitely a great spot when you're craving some delicious Sushi. #vegasfoodie #foodblogger #lasvegas #sushibomb #sushi #sushilovers #blogger #allyoucaneat #foodie @sushibomblv",

The server explained some of the exclusions and very sternly stated that they charge for anything unfinished. (Most places put that verbiage on their menu, but I've never had anyone verbally voice that...turnoff #1). Then we get to ordering sashimi vs nigiri and the server says you have to get it with rice on the ayce menu...ok, but you didn't state that at the beginning.  All in all, the food was fine...my husband really enjoyed the pork belly. The service was sort of horrible...we waited forever. Multiple people kept up with clearing our table but none of them could take our orders for more food. This is the closest sushi to our home, but I don't know if I'll be in a hurry to return.",

I decided to come back here with my husband and our seven-year-old, who loves sushi & can eat just as much as me, because we only live about 2-3 minutes away from this sushi joint.   To my pleasant surprise, they now offer half rolls! Woohoo! Guess who was a happy camper that day? Me! We tried Coconut Lover, Love Affair, Sushi Bomb, Japanese Lasagna, Mojave Beach, bacon & scallop skewers, nigiri (tuna, Cajun albacore, salmon, & eel), shrimp tempura, miso soup, and baked green mussels. Everything was delicious. Our absolute favorite was hands down the Coconut Lover. My husband fell in love with it! The nigiri was delicious and fresh. The baked green mussels were PERFECT! Miso soup was just the way my dad makes it - so delicious. And all you can eat bacon & scallop skewers? BOMB! My second favorite is definitely a tie between Love Affair and Mojave Beach! Mojave Beach because it's a mixed of different flavors and textures & it's very light!  We are definitely going to be regulars here. My daughter scarfed down probably 20 pieces of salmon and eel nigiri alone. I can definitely say that this is our new favorite sushi joint!",

Ordered three bento boxes and a roll immediately after sitting down. Told them we were pressed for time. We were one of two tables, the other had been served. We got our roll. Then waited. Then our soups that were included with the bento boxes. By this time 20 minutes had passed. We asked if the boxes were coming. He said they take 15 minutes to cook. We waited ten more minutes. Nothing. So we had empty soup bowls and no bento boxes. We asked for them to be boxed so we could take them to go and paid. The server says he's going to do it, but instead we watch him bring things to the other tables that have come in, one sauce bowl at a time. Now, we've been there for 38 minutes and don't have our food. I ask to speak to the manager, who isn't there. I've completely missed the opportunity to eat lunch. They refund us for the bento bowls, but charge us for the roll. I went back to work and my kids had to go to McDonald's instead. The food may not be better there, but at least the service was.",

The coating fell off the vegetables and shrimp and into my soup :( I don't know what changed from my last visit, but, it did put a damper on my experience.",

I love sitting at the bar, and every sushi restaurant I have ever been to, you can order from the bar. That's why I sit at the bar, so you can order the moment you're ready to eat again, and not wait on the waitress. Also, they seem to be understaffed every time I go there. Their menu is set up in a strange way, and it was confusing at first to read. I've been there a few times with my husband now, and I can navigate it a little better, but otherwise if my husband didn't like this place and it wasn't closer to home than my favorite sushi places, I probably wouldn't ever go here again.",

    "text": "I would say that my family and I have frequented this establishment quite often over the past three years of living in Las Vegas. Anytime someone asks where we like to eat sushi, we always say here. We have had nothing but great service time and time again, until tonight. We wanted a seat for three, wait time was told 20-30 minutes- which was fine. They were busy, but we were first in line for a table. About 10 minutes later a woman and her child came in requesting specifically to sit at the bar because a table was going to take too long. Watching one couple finish their desert we knew our time was coming! (Yay!- right?!) waitress sat the woman and her child at our table. I asked and all I got was an \"I'm so sorry\" nothing. Nothing. Waited a few more minutes before deciding to get with two other strangers and share the six top that had been empty long before we walked in.   Once seated we ordered drinks and our first round of food. Everything was great until after we noticed our second round of plates were empty and we had nothing left to eat. 45 minutes later we finally received our plate of nigiri and last roll. Not once during our meal were we asked if we would like to order, if we needed more drinks or how everything was. I ended up talking them into only charging me for two all you can eat and one single roll since my sister ordered the one roll that took over an hour to make and didn't eat anything else nor did she want to order more after sitting at the table watching us eat for an hour.   $87 later and I'll be honest, I didn't leave a tip. This truly breaks my heart to have had this experience at our (previously) favorite sushi restaurant.   I've worked in the food industry before, and I think a little communication and organization such as sections for a specific server so they're not all tending to every table would do a long way.   Love,  Broke and still hungry.",

Our server warned us in advance that any leftovers would be charged at regular price...although this is a rule we are aware of, I've never been verbally told about it.    I'm pretty picky with sushi, but surprisingly I loved one roll that I would never have ordered on my own.  I believe it was called The Hulk, which contains soft shell crab and some sort of yummy sauce.  In the end- the food was tasty, we were stuffed and the service was good.",

Listen.. it was so good we went twice in one week . You DEFINITELY get your money's worth doing the Ayce because you can pretty much get anything on the menu. Teriyaki chicken.. dessert.. The first time we went it was at 11 30 & service was great. The second time we went it was 12 &  got EXTREMELY busy.The problem was that there was only ONE SERVER.  Why have one server at lunch time? He was absolutely overwhelmed. The service was painfully slow.. people walked out.. there was a lot of complaining. Poor guy. I was irritated but when we FINALLY got our food, it was delicious. I'll definitely be back, but hopefully they won't be understaffed.",

I was excited to go back now that they offer AYCE, so I could try more rolls and see if their quality was still good.    And I was happy to find out -- it is!  We gave them a visit the other night and tried about nine different rolls between us... and I can't think of one thing to complain about on any of them.  Very fresh and VERY yummy.  I also thought the service was excellent.  They were great at keeping the rolls coming out one at a time, with no big lags between them.  They were also very friendly and didn't give us attitude (as some places do) when we wanted to order more.  I love the ambiance of this place, too.  Sure it's in a strip mall just like all of the other sushi places in Vegas, but the decor is really cute and the tables/chairs are nice and comfy. And even though the place was full, it wasn't too noisy at all.  There are only a couple small things that knock this rating down to a 4 from a 5 for me.  One... they don't allow you to order half-rolls, except for your very last order, which kinda bugs me.  And although they do let you order anything on the menu, their appetizer list is extreeeemely small.  I think they only offered 4-5 things.    Other than those small things, though, Sushi Bomb really was great!  We'll be going back again when our AYCE sushi craving hits and we want to stay on this side of town.",

Located in a small plaza in Cheyenne St by the 215, this is the place me and my buddies go after Church on a Sunday morning so it's never been busy or crowded for us.  They give you very big servings on sushi and sashimi. All you can eat lunch for $19.99.  Very easy to get full on just two sets of rolls here. Sonny our waiter (might be the manager too) is a very friendly guy and so are the other staff which you can regularly yelling out your order loud with heavy japanese accents.  All their special rolls are pretty tasty so you can't really go wrong with any choices.  But the common rolls, such as the california roll are no better than what you usually get from other sushi restaurants. I recommend going with a group of friends and order different specialty rolls so you all can have the chance to try different ones. They all have their own twist of flavor that will not disappoint.",

Well I wasn't in the mood gorge myself with rainbow rolls and I wanted to leave but Silvio wouldn't let me because we already sat down :)  So i ordered ala cart and my worst fear became a reality, the quality of the fish plummeted, the salmon nigiri tasted like albertsons salmon and the tuna was, well, ok I guess.    If they had the same quality fish as before and still had AYCE it would have been a frigging gold mine, but I digress, it is not.  I like sushi mon and this place seems comparable quality wise albeit 4 bucks more since to get the signature rolls there is an up-charge and not sure if you can order hot stuff off the menu with ayce.  The ala cart menu was reasonably priced however.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Freshness - The freshness is around average.        - Rice - All the nigiri has way too much rice in them. Anytime I see that, I wonder what other corners the establishment is cutting.        - Service - The sushi chefs were nice, but the waitress had an attitude problem that day. It was almost as if she was scolding me for not knowing that I had to order mussels and other items from the sushi chefs and not her. Furthermore, she never processed my dynamite order.        - Originality - This place has a lot of rolls I've never seen including the Stuffed Tomatoes and This Guy roll.        - Rules - They have more rules than your average sushi joint and some weird names for their sushi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=4r09Hm_dz_GKp_GSKIkYvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>). **Price**        - $19.95 Lunch AYCE Open - 3:30pm        - $26.95 Dinner AYCE 3:30pm - Close **Ordered**        - This Guy Roll (Tuna & Avocado Roll with a Spicy Soft-Shell Crab Ball with Spicy Garlic Ponzu Sauce) - The ball of spicy soft-shell crab was nice (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=j8FE2cjU71vIaKhWHD6M9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Stuffed Tomatoes (Imitation Crab Meat, Avocados, Shrimp, wrapped with Salmon with Orgasm Sauce) - No rice in this roll. The sauce was a bit too creamy though (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=-z1r1fRYJV98K71-ySmxXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Golden Dragon (Eel and Spicy Tuna on the inside topped with more Eel) - The eel and spicy tuna center made this roll feel like I was eating baby food (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=SuFaUOaT7v_pAr0E-JubIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Grilled Bacon & Scallop Skewer - This was a great skewer with eel sauce to top it (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=A9yP1_X_Z0jmV9eu1fuRWQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Grilled Shrimp w/ Vegi Skewer - The shrimp were pretty tiny, but it was good (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=l5AhXwmWFLr6zxHGrcNmMg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Nigiri - The sushi wasn't the freshest I've had in Vegas, but it was decent. However, the sushi is to rice ratio is pretty bad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=o34ITC4o8tVbZ2Njh8VUmQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>).        - Sushi Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=MSAhVq4gwgC_RyxERv0xlw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYA...</a>)        - Baked Green Mussels - They used some kind of sour sauce instead of eel sauce that made the mussels taste terrible. This was the first time I didn't finish a mussels on my plate ever. **Recommendations**        - If skewers and rolls are what you're looking for, this place isn't too bad. However, if you're thinking of ordering nigiri, you're probably better off going elsewhere.",

The food is good when you actually get it and by that I mean that trying to get someone to take your order is becoming impossible.  Today I went and there was 1 other table of 2 eating and it took me 25 minutes to get my order taken.  There were 2 in my party and when the other person ordered, the waitress started to walk away so I said wait I need to order as well. I got the roll I ordered and my daughter got 2 of the 2 things she ordered but the rest never came.  We finished our food and she never once came by to check on us until she brought the bill.  I wasn't charged for it but I hate ordering stuff and not getting it.  This has been an issue I have had too many times so I think it's time for a break and a new place.",

I've come here a couple times for late night AYCE ($27). Being that you can order ANYTHING off of the menu and the chalkboard specials and it's all under the AYCE umbrella, that's a pretty great deal. Some of their menu items included hamachi kama and okinomiyaki.   I really feel like the True testament to the nuts of a sushi place is in their nigiri. Find out what you wanna know ... it's in his fish. Anyways, the nigiri was kind of wussy, thin pieces of fish. Nothing exceptional, but also nothing catastrophic.   I think it's worth mentioning that all of the employees are Korean. There were three parties at the bar and no one else in the restaurant. The THREE sushi chefs behind the bar seemed to have trouble keeping up with orders.   The waiter boy isn't like a beck and call kind of guy. If you really want something, you'll have to stare at the back of his head for a bit.   #offthestrip #noncasino",

I have written a review about Sushi Bomb before (back in Nov 2011), but this time, I have to say, I won't be going back :(  The last review I gave them was 4 out of 5...Only a 4 cause of how slow the service was during lunch.    My friends and I dined there last night (March 30, 2012).  It was a Friday evening and it was another couple and our son who is 1yr 1/2 old.    So our bad journey began with slow service and a very very rude waitress.  I should have gotten her name (there are only a few servers that work there - she was the slightly older skinnier Asian lady server.  The younger one with wavy hair was very very nice!    Our bill was over $170 - All you can eat and drinks.  So for paying this kind of money at any restaurant for 4 people, would EQUAL = = = = GREAT SERVICE!  Wrong.  Our reservations was for 7:15.  We did not get out of the restaurant until after 10pm.  This was not our choice because our son was ready long LONG before.  I told my friends that our lunch service was slow and given that the restaurant seemed busy, I suggested that we try and order all your rolls at one time.  We ordered most or rolls so we didn't have to wait as long.  However, we needed a couple more.  I guess when you order more after the first round, you will have to wait cause others will be priority over you... or so it seemed.    When I told the guy (Host-with a girly kind of hair cut-not trying to be mean, just didn't get his name and that's the only way I could describe him) who said he is the manager, his explanation was and I quote \"the first round of sushi you probably had a fast sushi chef and they are all different, this time, you probably had a slower sushi chef and his speed is slower than the first guy that made your food\"   :o  WHAT??     We waited over 40minutes from when we ordered a couple more rolls before they came out (after a couple complaints too).  The server would barely ask us what we wanted nor did she seem happy to be there.  She was in a bad mood.  I totally get it, we all have bad days and we have busy days too that can drive us to the ground, but when the economy is the way it is (people seem to be pickier about where to eat or spend their money on), then I think customer service is going to help any business fail or succeed.  Bottom line, we should not have been treated the way we did.    -We asked for waters twice. -We waited over 15 min. for her to take our order the first time. -We had to keep asking for refills  -We asked for 2 cucumber salads in the beginning and never got them - until about almost 10pm cause they new at this point we were upset - we even said never mind on the cucumber salads  -We were treated horribly by our server the entire night (with the exception of the Host/Manager & that other server that tried to make it better)  -Our rolls the second time took over 40min. to come out - we did not order anything different than the last time, with the exception of us ordering only 3 rolls - lot less than the first round  Unfortunately, because of all the series of events that happened last night with the slow service and the extremely rude server, etc. etc. Our entire group will not go back.  There are far more sushi places that would deserve our time/money than this place.    I do not recommend this place to anyone with kids or anyone that wants to leave within less than 2 hours, especially for dinner.  I do have to say the best roll there is Sex on the Beach.   The all you can drink Sapporo for $3.99 is a good deal.   Make a reservation!!  We did and it helped but there were people waiting outside. Unfortunately for us, all of these things though will not help us go back.  I rather drive all the way to \"I Love Sushi\" in Henderson that isn't an all you can eat and pay just as much or a little more because I know they are deserving of my business.    I hope someone from Sushi Bomb reads this because I hope you improve on your customer service!!   Just a side note: We tried to tip the other nice server (cause she started to help us a little more at the end) and she said they all have to share the money - community tips.  Where is the incentive to do better and be a better server and treat people better?  There really isn't with this type of tipping service.    Overall bad time and we all left frustrated.  Our night didn't end well and that's not right.  :(  Sushi Bomb dropped a bomb on our night! It shook us up so much, they we are not going back!",

We came in tonight with new servers and staff. Our male server was a complete jerk from the beginning. He never smiled at us. When we all said we were doing \"all you can eat,\" he didn't believe us. He told us 20 minutes later that the kitchen was closing, but they weren't closing for another 45 minutes? Hmmm. He was totally rushing for us to leave. There was a female server that was helping him out--she was nice, but that's the only good thing i have to say about our experience.  All the while, while this was all happening, the owner was just sitting at a table just staring at us eat. Knowing we were unhappy about the service, and complaining to the female server, not once did he care to talk to us. Like a coward, he just sat from afar and stared.  Servers are supposed to earn their tips. That's why we eat out because we are paying for the service. We won't be back and i suggest no one else should if service like this continues.",

    "text": "Big fan of sushi... When we decided to go here for ayce I had never heard of it.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave us a piece of nigiri each... Good not great as tasted a little fishy. Then we shared a few rolls... The hulk, rabbit pearl and who love long time were really good (big fan spicy tuna or spicy rolls in general). He got the Mexican lasagna... It was good but I'm not a yum yum fan but he really liked it!  For $20 you are better off doing ayce than buying even two rolls for lunch! And sharing is perfect as get to taste more variety!  The service varied, she kept our glasses full and was good about bringing more ginger as we both really like it. The chef however seemed a little slow as 20 min later we had everything but one roll and he was kind of snippy saying its coming when we asked. But it was enjoyable And I would go back, especially to share sushi! Thanks for showing me a new place!",

I've seen some people talk about the quality of fish here, claiming that it's not fresh, or \"what can you expect, it's not on the coast?\" I haven't been to the coast yet,(hoping to soon) but it's really not THAT friggin' far. Any ways, I found the fish to be very fresh. The chefs used good cuts, and really seemed to know what they were doing. They had a lot of rolls that I haven't seen before, so I loved trying those out. The lasagna roll, I think it's called, was amazing. So was pretty much everything else I ordered. It definitely beats everything we had back in Atlanta. :)",

My daughter was with us she loves sushi and I had to wave a server down for children's chopsticks . We felt rush the whole time , and we had our server switch tables with another server and both of them forgot about us , basically had to wave people down the whole time , which made me feel like I was being a B**ch but I wasn't , I just wanted good service , I serve and partially manage in a fast paced restaurant and that was not a good experience .

Prices are compatible to others, and I feel the decor, speed and most importantly-the fresh taste of the fish make this one of the best values at the price point. I like that they offer a kids AYCE menu AND a separate kids entree menu so my four year old can find something she wants. One part of AYCE is that a lot of places, the rolls begin to taste very similar unless you stretch to the far corners of the menu.  Not do at Sushi Bomb, each roll had its own distinct flavor that did not disappoint.   I recommend the namesake roll, the Sushi Bomb as well as the White House roll.  My wife is a fan of the Coconut Lover. The service was quick and friendly. I will be back, I look forward to it",

It's not so crowded and the workers are very very nice! The garlic edamame is sooo yummy! The best I've had so far. Their salmon skin salad still has actually pieces of salmon skin unlike most places which now use salmon flakes or something? Their rolls are good and the rice is nicely cooked which I'm always so picky about. Will definitely be back!",

I don't think it's amazing compared to some better AYCE places in China Town but it definitely does the job. The fish is always fresh but a lot of their rolls contain cream cheese or something fried. They do have some different rolls you can't find any place else -- like a coconut lover roll with crunchy coconut on it! They also have this great 'plum wine' sauce on several rolls, it is very sweet but delicious.  I see the same people working their day to day. Everyone is friendly and they consistently check on your table.",

The service was good and the food was exceptional. Its great if you're trying to get your sushi fix. Nigiri is an option for lunch, but I just wish they had sashimi. Rice is such a filler.",

I asked them about rolls being gluten free and while they SAID \"yeah, this one is gluten free,\" I can ASSURE you it wasn't. FYI - imitation crab is chocked full of gluten. Also, any sauce that uses soy is also gluten-full. The only safe bet is sashimi or simple rolls with no \"spicy mix.\" They should have known that and they clearly didn't.  Things that are cool:  You can pay extra to have your roll wrapped in cucumber or soy paper instead of using rice (and seaweed). For us keto folk, this is awesome. BUT, I don't know if the price makes sense to do this for several rolls on AYCE, it can jack the bill up if you're ordering lots of rolls.   The ambience was normal for an AYCE place - you have like 4 servers and food runners, you're not sure who to order from, and there's K-pop on the TV. I'd come back if I was in the area and wanted some rice-free rolls, but I wouldn't make the effort if I wasn't already in the area.",

I got the crispy rice tuna roll and I think it was called the Wild Rest Roll.  I got it to go as I've said I felt terrible. They told me 30 min. It was ready in 30 min.

Salmon was a lot fresher than other places I've been to here coming from living on an island all my life - fresh sashimi is life to me!   Sauce was the reason for the one star shortage, it's on the sweet side for me but other than that - it's likely good for people with sweet tooths.   A couple minutes away from work is a plus!   AYCE sushi but have yet to go at it. Definitely on my todo list!",

After literally crawling to the bathroom I spent the next hour or so (it felt like a lifetime) with it \"firing out of both ends\" and I do mean firing. It was horrible -- I may have to move.  After cleaning up I went to the kitchen to get some water and found my oldest in the main bathroom also extremely sick. I've never been so sick from food in my life. Never again.",

    "text": "Checked out this place for a Sunday dinner service. Family of 4 including 2 young kids. The ambience is average and the place is a little more than average noise level.   After being seated, a server came over to ask for drink orders. When I paused to breathe, she took that as taking too long and walked away. This actually happened a second time as I was asking my kids what they wanted and that took too long for her. On her third arrival at the table, I literally had to ask her to give us 30 seconds to answer her questions before she walks away again.   So we ordered 2 kids meals and 2 AYCE. The server  was at least helpful in explaining how their AYCE works e.g. which items were excluded or limited to one.   I found it a little off-putting to have her emphasize to us the kids can't share our food. This was as they were dropping food off to the table and the kids meals still waiting to be done. I totally get that a business doesn't want to have people abuse the AYCE rules, but I highly doubt 2 little kids are going to eat them into bankruptcy.   Then I ordered one thing only to have the wrong item brought to the table. When it was mentioned to the server, he shrugged his shoulders and left it on the table anyway.   When asked to speak with a manager, surprisingly none on site! Can't say that I didn't see that one coming.   It's a shame because the food is good and there is a decent selection. They do seem to err on more spicy oriented special rolls. Which is how they got a second star from me.   Definitely not very family friendly in my opinion. So won't be back. I recommend you save yourself a bad experience like we had and it spoiled a nice time out with my family.",

The menu here is quite diverse, which I find to be pretty important when having AYCE sushi. Their rolls aren't all some variation of California rolls either.   I took off one star because a few of the menu items are extremely limited, such as \"one order per person\"..and that's total. I've heard of one order per round, but not per person. Will this prevent me from coming back? No. The fish tasted fresh and the presentation was great. Customer service was good, but not the best...Though i've come to lower my expectations for customer service at sushi restaurants. Overall, good quality food.",

Each recent visit the bomb has been busy but the service on the floor can't keep up. From the basic checking on drinks to reordering the staff does not seem to have any organization. Our table had every server wait on us - because we had to flag them down  Even after 4 of our party of six left (full) we waited for 15 min and THEN had to ASK for our check.  And they added the gratuity well above the level of service we received  Been one of my favorites but they better get their service together. Lots of choices out there.",

    "text": "The summary:  if you're looking for a decent sushi place in the northwest part of town that is all you can eat,  this should definitely be on your list.   The food was good, service was good,  atmosphere was great,  but not every place can be the best or else the 5 start best rating is meaningless.     After perusing Yelp and deciding I wanted to try this place I finally had a chance on my day off.  I usually like to try new places by myself and if it's good I'll bring friends.  I made the trek to this place on the northwest side of town.   It's in a nice shopping plaza and has more than adequate parking.     I was seated quickly and promptly asked if I wanted to do the all you can eat or ala cart.  I'm a bigger guy so guess which I was going to pick.   The all you can eat of course.     The are a couple rolls only available for dinner the Monster and the LABBQ.  I got these and 2 orders of the blue fin tuna and an order if cajun albacore.   The cajun albacore spice was not my favorite especially compared to my usual places.  The blue fin tuna was ok.   The Monster and LABBQ were big but nothing spectacular.   I tried their \"extremely spicy\" eau de toilette roll which will fairly good was not particularly spicy,  most of my regular places Kiss of Fire rolls have more oomph.  I also had half a DJ roll and a bacon roll.   The bacon roll was big again and the DJ was likely my favorite.     All in all I'm very spoiled living in the midst of so many amazing sushi places that are priced a little less.   I likely won't return unless I'm already in that area.  It was nothing worth driving extra for but it wasn't bad.  It definitely earns a good rating it's just I'm spoiled with so many other places that are in my opinion better.   If you're in the area I would suggest trying it for yourself.   You'll hopefully have a 5 start experience! Hopefully you'll declare that this place is the sushi bomb dot com.   For me the bomb fizzled a little.",

I also ordered the tuna roll and added cream cheese.   A couple complaints I have are about the AYCE: They charge extra to add cream cheese to a roll (or to make any other changes) and you're only allowed one mochi ice cream.  I would rather drive 20 more minutes to my fave spot and not have to deal with the restrictions on the AYCE.",

Both rolls I got were either not to my liking or just not good at all.. I ordered tempura red bean ice cream.. disappointing as well. Ice cream was super hard and the tempura was really thick and mainly only tempura.. was difficult to eat lol  None of the rolls really stood out..

We will definitely go back!!  -------------------  I'll start out by saying this place was an easy 4-5 star review.. BUT....  This was my families first time going to Sushi Bomb.  We are a family of 6, with one being an infant.  As we walked in, there was an immediate greeting, asking of how many people.. I said party of 6, they took us to a table and we sat down.  All of us ordered ALL YOU CAN EAT.. even the three young children.. the food arrived quickly and the taste was very fresh. Not a ton of sauce on the rolls not a ton of rice.. really it was well balanced for AYCE..  The problem came when the bill arrived, we had gratuity added on to the bill. This is disrespectful and should have been told about it prior to seating. Just adding to someone's bill is foul, and is a major turn off to an otherwise great meal!  Hopefully the Managment sees this review and trains the staff better to notify patrons or they remove this as a policy/practice.",

The sushi here is still very good don't get me wrong but I think the thing that's amazing is the fact that it is good quality sushi on the west side of town. Locals living around that summerlin area, it's hard to beat. We don't have to drive 30 min there and 30 min back. And I don't know about you but when I get so full from sushi, the seat belt hurts to get around my plump belly. Proximity to home, the quality is still good and the service is good.

What struck me was the sheer number of sushi roll variations including new twists on old standby's.  Indicated menu prices were about average for the valley. I tried the coconut roll and my son ordered a roll with buffalo sauce. Both were tasty and filling. The location was extremely busy for a late afternoon and it looks like they have a very steady clientele. We enjoyed the food and had a great time. We'll definitely be back.",

All the rolls were large and fresh.  If you want wicked spicy, try the Au De Toilet roll, it will knock your socks off.  The bacon/scallop skewers were great, as was the salmon collar.

    "text": "Oh, the wonders of Yelp!   AYCE sushi... what more do I need to say?? For $29 (the price when I came here), you can eat all the sushi, rolls, hot items, bentos, appetizers, and salads you want. Within the time limit, of course. Don't worry, it's reasonable. There are certain items that are off limits and not included as part of their AYCE items, like sashimi and other items that are labeled on their extensive menu. But that's okay! There is generally no limit as to the amount of items you can order at one time, but make sure you finish everything you order or they will charge you for it!  I didn't have any reservations, and when I called, they said they weren't taking reservations. But we were seated right when we got there on a Sunday evening. It was busy, but the wait time was not so bad for everyone else.   If you don't want to do AYCE, you can also order ala carte. But you can't switch to AYCE once you've told them you're taking the ala carte route. So, come hungry. It's a great deal. The quality of the sushi is really good for the price you're paying. The wait for the food isn't very long either. The service is fantastic - very friendly and helpful staff.   The establishment is a bit on the smaller side. The staff will have to squeeze their way and maneuver between the tables. It's not an uncomfortable small space, but you do sit about an arm's length away from the next table. There is table seating as well as a handful of bar seats.  Check them out if you're ever in the area. I love sushi, and I have to say I really enjoyed what they offered.",

My sushi palate is a bit more sophisticated so I wasn't as pleased. The service was extremely good but we were also the only customers in the restaurant at the time.  The chef was extremely friendly and talkative. When I ordered some hamachi sushi, he cut me a fantastic piece from the belly. It was excellent. On the other hand, the spicy tuna was not; it was pre-made and very mushy. The hand roll didn't include any yamagobo or even a few pieces of cucumber.  I was also a bit disappointed in their sake selection. I asked for a ginjo sake, but the best they had was unfiltered.",

One of you younger sushi chefts, usually very unfriendly and sarcastic, refused to make us the last item we ordered.  When we inquired, he said he was too busy.  There were only two other sets of customers in the entire place.  While we enjoyed some of the items they made, there are much better and less costly places nearby.  This place is totally lacking in customer service, especially when you have customers such as us that had been frequented the place so much.  Obviously the owner does not care as I have never seen any replies to any type of bad review.  We just decided to not give our business to someone that does not appreciate it.

It seemed to me the majority of the rolls had either eel in them or they were spicy.  I can't stand eel and my best friend doesn't eat spicy so we really had a problem looking at what rolls to eat.  We asked if we could sub spicy tuna for regular tuna and the server didn't understand what we were saying.  I had major issues with the service but will get to that later.  Back to the food....we ordered tempura which pieces were so undercooked we couldn't eat it.   Seriously, I have no idea what veggie it was.   It was like a rock.  The rolls were so so.  Nothing stood out.   Ok I understand they had some issues with service being bad.  Being in the industry I consider myself a little more patient than others.  It wasn't like they ignored us, it was the complete opposite.  I couldn't finish a sentence without them coming and asking us how everything was.   We told them to leave the menus, 3 different people tried to take them.   I asked them questions about the menu and they had no idea what some of the items were.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.   Personally, I love it that they asked how we were doing but really, every 2 minutes.  Annoying.   They need to find a balance with the service.",

Biggest complaint of our dinner was when we asked for the \"daily special\" called stuffed tomato they said they were out of it. When we asked what they were out of they then said they weren't making this roll anymore tonight, and this was 45 minutes before closing. At this time we also noticed the sushi chefs putting the fish away and cleaning up their stations as well as the waitresses and hostess putting their jackets on and getting ready to leave. We were very uncomfortable and felt almost forced to leave even though they weren't closing yet. We enjoy sushi on a regular basis and there are closer places to our house, so we will not be going out of our way to go there again.",

Today my boss decided we should have a lunch meeting at Sushi Bomb, and since I love sushi I was not about to argue with him!  When we arrived we were the only people in the entire place. The hostess/waitress was friendly and efficient. Since it was 'his place' I let my boss order some things to get us started. He went with an order of edamame, some eggrolls and this fried jalapeno thing, I can not recall the name but it was like a popper, deep fried and stuffed with cream cheese.   The edamame was perfect, a nice large portion with just enough salt. The eggrolls were also good, on the small side but thats ok because I didn't want to get full on appetizers. I never eat jalapenos, but after some arm twisting I gave these a try... Was glad I did because they were not hot at all.   For the rest of our meal we decided on the the bj, the I love tuna and vegas rolls. Everything tasted great, the tuna tasted very fresh. The Vegas roll was my favorite, mmm cream cheese.   I'd go back to Sushi Bomb for sure if it was closer to me...",

The waiter seemed a tad inexperienced, but he was very friendly so I didn't mind.  I've only been there for dinner, so I can only vouch for that.  It's pretty expensive though.  Expect to pay around $60 for two at dinnertime.  That's only if you follow the rules and don't leave any leftovers.",

We've never had an issue with the service, but a couple of months ago, a new guy and he's been our waiter the last two times--he's hilarious! Upbeat, energetic and funny!   The rolls just can't be beat. They are all delicious, our favorite being Sex on the Beach and One Night Stand. There was one roll that we had never tried before, The Red Tiger, but our server insisted we try it a couple months ago and it's now another one of our favorites. Last month when we were in, he remembered what we ordered, which is always nice. A lot of their rolls are spicy, but that's fine for us--we love spicy foods.  Two large-screen TVs are really nice during football season too. The staff is really good about letting you pick what channel you want to watch.  I have tried a few other sushi places in town (Sushi Bomb isn't around the corner from my house, so when I go out with my daughter, we try places near home) and I always end up not liking the other places and I always compare them to Sushi Bomb. Nothing compares.  For the price and the service and the flavor and variety, I can't find a better place in town. So delicious.",

I have my all time favorite spot but being that this is closer to my place i usually go here haha The staff is friendly and fairly fast with the service. Its a very small place but if you dont mind the wait im sure you wont be disappointed. The all you can eat sushi is worth the price. If you were to do the ala cart, by the time youve ordered 3-4 different things youde already have paid the price for the all you can eat. It would be nice if they did have a bigger seating area as they do get busy. But lts worth the wait.",

Then there was \"the best chicken fried rice\" that my husband's ever had. Then there were the extremely filling bento boxes that my kids ordered. And I haven't even gotten to the sushi rolls yet - the Hulk (soft shell crab topped with more soft shell crab & avocado); the 007 (California roll with shrimp on top); spicy tuna & octopus... Very very yummy! We didn't order anything really exotic because if the basics are good, the specialties are usually better. Also considering that they only had two servers at dinner-time on Saturday evening, the service was pretty attentive. To cap off our meal we had a banana split consisting of tempura fried banana, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, caramel & a cherry on top. Good stuff. We'll be back.",

Most restaurants it's kind of obvious if the guest isn't eating anymore or ordering anymore food, and says they are ok, they are waiting for their check. This waitress came up and said with a snobby attitude if we are done yet? Yeah!! We were waiting to get our check! Then after she asked us 3 other people asked if we need our check. Way to make a guest feel like you're rushing them to get out, but the kicker is we were ready to leave but waiting for them to get our check. The only nice person was our waiter I would have rather just dealt with him instead the other waitresses especially the snobby one.",

We usually go in for dinner but today we went for a late lunch.  I always get the all you can eat and today was no different except that before 3:00pm it's $21 instead of $27.  Oh great I thought.  I'll save $6.  Not a huge sum but it's money.  We got there at 2:45.  When presented with the bill I was surprised to see that I had been charged the dinner price.  Upon asking our waiter why the discrepancy I was at that time informed that even though we had arrived at least 10 minutes before 3:00pm and ordered right before 3:00 and this did not matter.  My reaction was shock.  Have you ever heard of such a thing?  I haven't.  You have 50 minutes to eat the lunch all you can eat so that must mean that if you order at 2:15 you're going to be charged the dinner price.  I told the waiter this was unacceptable and we won't come back if this stands and I don't think either he nor the manager cared.  We tip well and the bill is usually $100.  I guess that doesn't mean anything these days.  Sad that we have to find a new sushi place.",

I did AYCE and I have to say my Favorite part is their appetizers. We tried almost all of them I loved them all. My favorite roll was the Love Affair roll. The restaurant was extremely clean which is a HUGE plus for me as well. Staff is super helpful in guiding you through the menu to get you exactly what you will love!",

Our server Jennifer is the \"bomb baby !!\" If I had a restaurant I'd steal her !! My favorites ?? Dancing Spider for appetizer. Omg the best. My hubby and I order several different types of sushi and they bring it out on one large platter. That's the way to go if you don't want to be overstuffed. The fish v rice portions are perfect. Get the sushi bomb roll to seal the deal. My forever favorite sushi restaurant !!!",

    "text": "I found this place yelping while driving around the new neighborhood that I just moved in to. It was around 6pm on a Saturday night and our party of 4 was seated immediately and greeted by our waiter Paul, who was an amazing server.  As any good server would, Paul immediately checked if we all had a setting, gave us menus and took our drink orders. Looking at the menu (each roll roughly priced around $12) AYCE is definitely the way to go.  When Paul came back with our waters and drinks he asked if he could get any appetizers started. We ordered the Garlic Edamame (amazing! Probably the best I've had at a AYCE place), Cold Tofu Salad (comes with a great and tasty sauce), cucumber salad, sea weed salad and oysters. Unfortunately after taking our order and putting it in, Paul had to come back to let us know that they ran out of oysters. It would have been nice for him to let us know before hand. He did recommend other alternatives and his favorites, which I appreciated.   We ordered many rolls but my top favorites were: 1.) coconut lovers roll 2.) salmon lovers roll 3.) BBQ rib roll 4.) Baja yellowtail roll 5.) Sushi bomb roll   Don't forget to end your Sushi Bomb experience with dessert! The Honey Toast is mouth watering greatness!   I am very impressed with this AYCE place. Great quality. Amazing service. And such good food. I'm glad Yelp brought us together and I hope to be back soon. It's a bummer that they got rid of the promotions that the other reviews talk about like the all you can drink draft beer with AYCE sushi for 4.99 and the buy two get one free deal! :( *if you read those reviews note that the promos are no longer going on.*",

So last night I finally gave Sushi Bomb a try.  I have to be honest, it was very underwhelming.  The quality of the rolls were on par with what you would buy in a grocery store deli.  The sushi is not terrible, but it's mediocre at best.  The ingredients were not as good as the place we normally go to (Sushi Fever). While the prices at Sushi Bomb were slightly lower than Sushi Fever, the difference in quality leaves Sushi Fever as the overall better value.  The decor and ambiance is cool though.  And the staff was attentive and friendly.",

Edaname, Philadelphia roll, and Japanese lasagna. I do enjoy their Japanese lasagna, best I've had anywhere. Service can be a little slow. I'm not quite sure why I'm even reviewing this place since I'm not a sushi expert.",

We sat at the bar but it really doesn't make a difference here as a waiter still takes your order. Service was fast and friendly. My favorite roll of the night was the white house. The fish is great quality!! I also tried honey toast for dessert...it's honey drizzled toast with vanilla ice cream and will be the reason why I go back...it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend to finish with honey toast!",

You can't beat all the yummy stuff that you can eat with their AYCE though, which is pretty much their full menu. Some of our favorites are the Coconut Lover roll, the pork belly, the green muscles and their Nigiri is always good. Their specials they have are always great and change often to always give you something new to try. You also get $3 Sapporo beers when you eat AYCE, can't beat that!",

A few issues: Not a fan of the 'orgasm sauce' they use there. It came on the rock n roll and the stuffed tomato (which everywhere I've had this they do not sauce this roll) There imitation crab tastes funny (maybe it was just me)  I really really enjoyed the angry dragon roll, perfect perfect sweet and spicy blend!  The bf had his usual chicken teriyaki and Sapporo which he said was very satisfying and well worth the price paid.  The rolls were not overly rice-y like some AYCE places; there was plenty of fish.   Overall the food was good and the service was decent. The price is great.",

Most of the fish tasted fresh, some with great flavor actually! A few seemed a little dry and not quite as fresh, but I only noticed that on some of the nigiri.

They don't include the Hamachi kama in the AYCE, so the salmon had to tide me over! Had a great taste...better than most actually!  Probably the highlight of the lunch for me :)  Pic : <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA#GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>  The rolls were great, with my most favorite being the Rabbit Pearl : Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab and Cucumber topped with Spicy Crab, Shrimp and Avocado...Spicy ponzu sauce and crunch!  This was easily the best roll we tried in my eyes! Perfect amount of spice and flavor!   Pic : <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=TLsxftXGuTx6odSFz-lcKg#TLsxftXGuTx6odSFz-lcKg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>  I really liked how they include Yakitori as well! The beef was ok...a bit chewy, but good overall.

Of course I had to try it...a few choices of ice cream, but the Green Tea actually had lots of tea flavor and was yummy! The toast itself was good, plenty of honey...and was overall a good choice!

Check them out if you are ever on this side of town...all the way on W Cheyenne and the 215!  It would be worth the drive to switch it up :)",

    "text": "We decided to try this AYCE lunch special- $21 each before 3 PM- because this place is very close to where we live. The seating area is very small, but wasn't crowded, which was nice. The walls inside were painted with large fish and the decor was all cohesive. Now for the food!  We ordered an order of seaweed salad, veggie tempura, and calamari tempura. All were good.  For rolls, I ordered a Monster roll, a Snow Rabbit, and something else with lots of eel. I can't remember the name! My girlfriend started off with one order of some roll comprised of deep fried banana, sweet potato, and crunchy onions. We stopped there for rolls because we aren't great at AYCE sushi just yet.   After we finished our rolls, we ordered dessert. I got tempura red bean icecream and she got honey toast! Both were quite larger than I was expecting and the tempura icecream really hit the spot for me.   I added everything up and if we were going a la carte, we'd have spent a little more than double what we paid in the end.  Good servers, and a good option outside of Chinatown!",

    "text": "I had to grab a quick lunch and there were only a few options near where I was working that day, so I ended up at Sushi Bomb. The interior was not too big, but it wasn't that busy for a weekday lunch (just a few other dining patrons).  Service was friendly and prompt, and my water were refilled consistently. I ended up ordering a roll, an appetizer, and a miso soup, but realized that my items' cost added up already exceeded the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) price (~$21+tax). Thus, I decided to switch to the AYCE dining option, which includes most of the menu (except some that are excluded, some that are dinner-only, and some that you can only order once).  I was very satisfied with the value once I chose AYCE, as I was able to add several other items to my meal. To the restaurant's credit, food preparation and service was very fast, such that I was able to have a full AYCE meal in just 30 minutes (I originally did not plan to order AYCE since I had such limited time). FYI, the time limit for AYCE lunch is usually 50 minutes.  This location is a bit far from home, but if I'm ever in the area, I would consider returning for their AYCE specials! See my photos for details about what I ate.  P.S. This place is Korean-owned with Korean employees and even occasional Korean pop music playing, but no one said this was an authentic Japanese restaurant. I still enjoyed my meal here and would recommend this place.",

It was quite crowded, even on a Wednesday evening, because it is a small restaurant. But we opted to sit at the bar. Nice selection of saki, too. We chose the all you can eat but honestly, I could barely put down two rolls so it would've been more cost effective if I did a la carte. I would definitely recommend this place but I personally wouldn't go on a Friday or Saturday because of how busy it was even mid-week. If you like spicier rolls, go for the Red Rock. It was delicious but had some kick.",

I don't see how this place has such positive reviews with such low quality fish. Literally giving it two stars solely because of the appetizers.",

The food is great. The ambience is amazing. The decorations on the walls are very nice as well. Not to mention how amazing the prices are. I also love their miso soup!  My only complaint is that every few visits, service is slow. It takes a while to be seated and there isn't always a host/hostess at the table (even if there are tons of visible empty tables). They don't seem to have too many people working there, but thankfully, I've never had to wait more than 5~10 minutes--it just seems like a long time when you see the empty tables and you are very hungry!  I definitely would keep coming here whenever I'm in the area. I recommend Sushi Bomb to anyone who appreciates quality food.",

I dislike too much rice on the AYCE rolls - Sushi Bomb's Fish/Veggie/Rice ratio was spot on. Our waitress was very helpful, pointing out the differences between the types of rolls we were considering. We started with 3 rolls & hot sake, then ended with mochi - I had the red bean & Hubby had chocolate. As good as we could expect from a neighborhood sushi restaurant!",

Several appetizers are delicious the edamame with garlic, baked mussels and dynamite dish are good starters.  They do not pack the rolls with a lot of rice like other AYCE places. They have a great variety of rolls  & they arrive in a reasonable amount of time.   They will work with you if you have allergies with no attitude which is refreshing !  Dessert is included if you can save room. My favorite rolls are  The monster roll The Vegas roll Spicy tiger  Shrimp lover roll Philly roll",

Luckily the server was very accommodating and allowed us to pay the lunch price, as long as we finished putting in our order by the cut-off.   There is a great selection of AYCE menu items including appetizers, entrees, and desserts. It's $21 for AYCE lunch and $27 for dinner (kids are cheaper), and you will definitely get your money's worth.   As far as sushi quality goes, everything was good. The unagi, ahi, hamachi and smoked salmon nigiri were delicious. Rolls are big and if you're placing your last order they allow half orders. We tried the 007, Snow Rabbit, White House, and the DJ.   All of that sushi plus side orders of chicken karaage, ika tempura, gyoza, and zaru soba left my boyfriend and I very VERY full.   Service was prompt and our server was helpful and polite. Sushi Bomb is a great option for sushi in our neighborhood.",

He asked the same reserver who seated us if she would grab us a menu. I watched as she asked another server to help us because she went to go take a bigger party's order. We waited about 5 minutes and still no menu. So a total of 15 maybe 20 minutes no drinks bought to us and still no menu. As we got up to walk out she stood there and watched us leave. No attempt to apologize or say anything.  I give this place a 1 star based on customer service. Also I want to mention the place was not busy.",

Seemed like they were more attentive after I whipped out my yelp coupon for free draft beer for checking in. It   Nigiri definitely has way too much rice on it. The fish was pretty fresh but sliced so paper thin I could see through it. Almost like they were trying to ration their fish.   When the server delivered our combo tempura a freaking ant came with it!!!   They don't do half rolls unless it's your very last roll. The rolls are the standard portion of rice but some looked scaled down.   In the end the menu is pretty large with a lot of variety just don't expect large portions.   Would I come back?

Going to a sushi restaurant I'm always looking around making sure it's clean and a little cold, we don't need to get sick. the price's are pretty average and the sushi tastes fresh. If your in the area defiantly check it out you wont be disappointed.",

We were one of two parties in the restaurant, so I guarantee your job wasn't that effing difficult while we were there. Horrible service, and horrible food. Sushi bomb is simply an explosion of attitude and disappointment.",

    "text": "What happened Sushi Bomb? This used to be a great place years ago, but ever since new management took over, it has not been the same.   So, the waitress had no personality and looked pretty annoyed while taking our orders. She was seriously so SLOW. My boyfriend and I didn't even get offered any drinks or a menu until about 10-15 minutes after we sat down with my family.   Some of their specialty rolls like the Touchdown was good. Their eel sauce as part of the DJ's Special (one of my favorite rolls) seriously tasted like cinnamon was way too sweet for me. I was a little bummed.  Overall, they need to fix their customer service, timing and definitely try to be more attentive to their guests.",

The sushi is SO good though!  The spicy garlic edamame, the S & H special, their sashimi... just amazing.  And really.. the service has never been a problem for me.  Really, give this place a try. :)",

They had Ocean Trout which was very nice along with Giant Clam.  Mmmmmm.  They also offer all you can drink for an extra $6.00 so it is well worth it.  Rather than getting a pitcher, we got glasses, so the beer was always cold. You just had to ask for more beer.    We went early (5:30 ) and by the time we left a little after 7:00 the place was packed.",

They offer more than sushi if you have those silly friends who don't eat it and now with the half roll option, you get to try even more! They lose a star because quite honestly, if it wasn't for their hard working helper John, who kicks ass and makes up for most of their shortcomings, their service isn't fabulous. A little slow and not always friendly.... but the food is great and worth a slightly curt server.",

There are 12 in the room plus the sushi bar.  We ordered all you can eat Sushi for $25.99 and for $3.99 more we had all you can drink beer (Saparo).    The sushi rolls were huge!! I've had Sushi Mon AYCE and the sushi is smaller/scaled down for AYCE patrons.  This sushi was huge!! Everything on the menu from appetizers to desserts and regular to special sushi rolls are includedin AYCE, except for Sashimi.    Over all the ambiance was very nice and clean.  The service was excellent.  I will be making this a regular spot!  I posted several pics!",

However, since then they have fired that waiter and the restaurant has done a complete 180.  They have always had good food, no one every doubted that, but their service was rude. Now the service is great and you can actually enjoy the food! Sometimes the rolls can be a little too big and hard to eat, but my boyfriend asked if they could make them a little smaller so they were easier to eat and they happily did, it came out with more pieces that were smaller so it was the same amount of food.   I'm sure we'll be back a lot because they are extremely close by and we do love their sushi, and now that they have fixed the service issue nothing gets in the way of enjoying that food.   Highlight: lunch special all you can eat is only $20. :D",
