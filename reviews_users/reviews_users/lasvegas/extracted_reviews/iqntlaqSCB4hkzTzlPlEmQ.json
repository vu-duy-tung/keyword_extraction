    "text": "OMG!!!  What an amazing experience.  I have to say that the primary reason we selected this place was we had a buy one/get one coupon up to $25 off as well as a $50 gift card.  It was our 21st wedding anniversary and we thought \"why not\".  I had mentioned it to a friend and she highly suggested we go elsewhere; she had visited this place when it first opened and thought it wasn't very good. Well, I am SOOOOO GLAD we did not listen to her review.  I also want to say up front that our server, Jake J (4014) was as good as it gets!  We felt he was one of the best servers we've ever had.  He was attentive but not overly so; must husband had a couple of questions and he came back promptly with answers; and was so incredibly friendly, honest, and sincere.  My husband had the Lobster Bisque and Chicken Marsala and I had the Italian Wedding Soup and the Shrimp Fra Diavolo--thanks to Jake!  I was going to order the Lobster Ravioli and asked if he knew how it was; he readily said it was very good but his favorite was the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which was my second choice.  So based on his recommendation, I ordered that and was very glad I did.  The bread and dipping oil was delicious.  The soup and meal were served very promptly and all was very, very palate pleasing.  When I called to make our reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion so I told them it was our anniversary.  They included -- at no charge -- a molten chocolate cake with a delicious sauce (menu says \"anglaise\") and vanilla bean gelato.  Since we were already quite full, they put the dessert in a \"go box\" (separating the gelato) for us!!!   With Jake as our amazing server and the food so delicious, we had quite a special anniversary.  We thank the establishment so much.  We WILL definitely be back.",

Middle class thinking Italian is good or at least better than olive garden,  hello.   Olive garden is the Macdonalds of Italian food,  of course its better.   Still if you are in Vegas,  this is OK price and food for your Italian fix.",

Their service was a bit slow, but we never had to wait for long (only paying the bill itself took awhile); both our bread baskets and our drinks were always being refilled.   The food was fantastic and the seating was great for our rather decent-sized group. We often have to struggle the latter part especially, but no problems here.  It's definitely a huge step up from most of the places to eat at the mall and is one of the best choices of Italian food within the area.",

Everything was good chopped salad, bread, entree and dessert but waiter didn't attend to our empty waters. We'll go back! Large portions not like some restaurants. They discontinued the deal for two dinners at $29.95. They said it was just for the holiday season. Well I thought it still was the holiday season thru New Year's Day. The place was empty so split a pizza not great and had two chopped salads. Wish we had gone elsewhere.",

This is the main reason we dine here and when we went for dinner with friends on 11/5/17 several of their (formerly excellent) gluten free options had been removed from the menu. Sadly, this eliminates the attraction to dine at bravo since the remaining GF selections leave me few options. Too bad because we used to love coming here. Adding the chicken selections back on to the menu & maybe some bread & pizza considerations would be appreciated.",

We had heard that the food was good, and we wanted a new Italian spot, so we decided to go on a Thursday night (so it wasn't too busy).  The wait staff and hostesses were all very attentive and polite. The decor was up to date, and we were seated promptly.   My husband ordered some pizza, my kids had several items off of the children's menu, and I had pasta with fire roasted peppers and cream sauce. The dish I chose was pretty bland, and the macaroni and cheese the kids had looked like Kraft straight out of the box. The pizza was ok, but the crust was soggy in the middle.   I really wanted this place to be good, but I probably won't return. 3 stars for service - 0 for food. I'll stick with Maggiano's.",

    "text": "Last night was our second time at Bravo in 2 weeks; our first visit was lunch and if you want to try something absolutely fantastic try the meatball and marscapone Polenta. It was to die for! Last night four of us had spaghetti Bolognese, Chicken Milanese, Shrimp Fra Diavolo and my choice was the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  Everyone thought their dinners were superb and they were. I actually bought two containers of the Bolognese sauce to bring home with me it was that good. And I make great Bolognese sauce.  One of my favorite soups to make is Italian wedding soup and Bravo's  yis outstanding; may  not be homemade but it's great nevertheless. Their salads are very crisp and fresh. The delicious fresh, hot bread they serve before the meal is accompanied by a very good sun-dried tomato dipping sauce which they sell on a table next to the front door if you're interested in bringing some home.  Service of course was impeccable as it is at Brio their sister restaurant. The ambience is really very nice-a great place to bring guests.  White tablecloth, very tasteful and pleasant decor.  They have a beautiful patio section and the misters were on last night but the temperature was 106 and we decided not to chance it but we will definitely dine on that great patio our next time there.  The wall fountain next-door at Larson Grill  gives a very pleasant view. This is definitely our new go-to Italian restaurant.",

Staff was friendly and eager to please.   The fresh baked Focaccia Bread and dipping oil they bring out before hand is fantastic. Some of the best table bread I've had.   I started the meal with the Insulata Della Casa Salad. It was made with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, black olives and cucumbers tossed in feta and a Parmesan dressing. Everything was crisp and fresh. The salad was huge, enough to share with another.   We also tried the Italian Wedding Soup. It was fantastic. It tasted fresh made. It was full of carrots, greens, orzo and little meatballs. It was very good, I'd order it again. It tastes homemade.   For our entree' my son tried the Fettuccine Alfredo which was a bit thicker than I like but still good and the pasta tasted fresh made. He loved it and ate the whole dish.   My husband tried a pizza. He likened it to Grimaldi's which is his favorite!! It's an authentic style pizza with a homemade chewy crust that still crunches a bit when you bite into it.   I ordered the Pasta Bravo, their house specialty. I asked for Campanelle instead of the rigatoni it comes with. It was delicious! The sauce was creamy, spicy and tasted fresh made. The mushrooms were fat and still had some crunch to them. The chicken was tender, although I would have preferred a seasoned grilled chicken, it was kind of bland but the sauce corrected any blandness.   This place is great! We'll absolutely be back!",

Let's start off with the appetizers, Fried Calamari and Crispy Shrimp Napoli.  They were money.  Very good appetizers.  The salads (Caesar and House) were both very good.  The misses were when it came to the steak orders.  One of the people in my party ordered a Ribeye and the other ordered a Sirloin (well done).  After the order was placed, the server came back and broke the news, they were out of Ribeyes.  Nothing worse than getting your mind set on an entree only to find out a few minutes later that the Chef said they are out.   Could have been avoided.  When the Sirloin came out it was very undercooked. It had to go back and took forever.   My Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka with Shrimp.  It was a little underwhelming when it came to the shrimp.  They were very small.  It did taste great though. My other family members got pizza and Baked Chicken Parmesan.  They really liked those dishes.  The management reduced the bill for the inconveniences and undercooked steak. So I can't complain.  The service was excellent.  In my book, 5 stars is a perfect Yelp experience and this was not a perfect experience.  Would I come back here again and/or recommend this place to friends.....Absolutely.",

The calamari appetizer was cooked perfectly and the horseradish dipping sauce was dreamy.  Lobster ravioli left a lot to be desired without pronounced lobster meat, and the sauce would overwhelm lobster any day.  Chicken piccata was delicious. The lemon caper sauce was perfectly balanced between sharp vinegar & smooth butter with the capers being the star. It would have been a 5 star meal if it was not luke-warm. Herbed linguini side dish was piping hot, but chicken was cool. Bummer.",

    "text": "We were meeting friends in the area of the Galleria Mall and wanted a dinner where we could sit and talk in a nice setting at a reasonable price. I had been to Bravo before and thought it would fit the bill. Ambiance: Located on the outside of the mall, it is easy to get to with ample free parking. The decorating is best described as \"Brio Lite.\" If you are familiar with the Brio chain of restaurants, this is the less well endowed kid brother. Overall, very pleasant - nothing too extravagant. The tables are very nicely spaced. the night we came, it was not crowded so no problem having a conversation, even at a fairly large round table for 6. Overall, a 4 rating for ambiance. Service: the service was outstanding. Within a few minutes of our sitting, Jason, our server, was at the table to answer any questions about the menu and take our drink orders. Very friendly and welcoming. A few minutes after that, the food runner brought a small basket of tasty bread. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive. Our water glasses never got below half full. Service would rate a 5. Food: I ordered the jumbo shrimp. The kitchen gets bonus points for presentation. The dish consisted of about six or seven shrimp laid out on the bed of or orzo and farro with some feta and roasted pepper thrown in. The taste was truly delicious. My only gripe was the name of the dish. It really should've been called average size shrimp rather than jumbo. My wife had the Porkchop. She said it was good but not great. Our friends had the grilled mahi. They felt that the preparation was a little spicier than they would've liked. Value: The entrees were each between $17 and $22. You could add a side salad (very generous size) for an extra $4.25. Excellent value for what you pay. Overall, a strong 4 star rating.",

The staff was extremely easy to work with, starting with the reservation all the way through the service at the event. Picking the menu was very simple and easy, and the printed menu was cool to have for our guests and made dinner selections very easy. We had their large private room to ourselves, which was really special. They let us come by a few times before the event to scope it out. And we also had access early in that day to drop off things like gifts/cake so we didn't have to bring them with us that night. We were able to control the music and the air for our own room. And we could even close/open the curtains to make it more private or not. Our party was for about 24 people, and when we first sat down, the tables were a little crowded. They brought us extra tables and set them up without even disturbing the dinner. The service was 5 stars throughout, they even cut up and served a cake we brought ourselves. Our guests kept talking about how delicious the food was, too. Really special, and a great way to kick off our wedding weekend!",

Assuming she just meant alcohol and not wanting to drink on my lunch hour, she seated me in the restaurant. I again asked the waitress about the special and she informed me it ended at 3:00. Not excited about spending $25 on lunch, ordered an appetizer (very tasty!!) & an iced tea. Waitress called me \"hun\" 4 times and I'm 2.5x her age--rude! Little buff buss boy couldn't keep his eyes off the patron's daughters, either. Should've been more amusing than annoying but I was already perturbed. Returned to work to find that happy hour in the bar INCLUDES food. Could anyone have told me THAT??? Won't go back, convenient or not, tasty or not--too wanna-be pretentious!

    "text": "Wanted to try a new spot for Italian food and found this while driving by The Galleria. It has a big outdoor dining area, but it was too cold this evening to be outside. While looking at the menu outside, the hostess was wiping down the doors and cane outside to ask if we needed help with the menu. We asked if they had fettuccini Alfredo and she said they have a Pasta Woozie that would be equivalent, but it has spinach in it, but I can request no spinach.  We decided to go in and have dinner there. The restaurant is actually pretty big with a bar to the left, a sectioned off private dining area for large parties, and a central dining area. The decor was warm and intimate, but still casual enough for me to feel welcomed. Our server Jeraldine was attentive and fast.   A side of rosemary foccacia bread served with their signature dipping olive oil was a good start. The bread was soft and not crumbly. The lobster bisque was creamy and had good chunks of lobster in it. Definitely would reorder again. The calamari appetizer came with two sauces on the plate. A creamy horseradish and a pompodoro sauce. The horseradish did not have a strong bite to it, which was fine by me. The pompodoro had a strong alcohol aftertaste to me, which I did not like at all. The waitress explained to me that pompodoro was just tomatoes, so no alcohol was in it. My s.o. did not taste the same thing I did and said the red sauce tasted fine. So I just skipped the sauce afterwards. The calamari was a little heavy breaded, so probably will not reorder again. The fettucuni alfredo was creamy and rich. The pasta dish I got with grilled chicken and a slightly spicy red sauce was full of robust tomato flavor, so I enjoyed that. The Island Smash cocktail was refreshing and had a pineapple and basil garnish. The hostess and waitress checked on us several times to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed. Just really good service from start to finish.  All in all, I would come back to dine again. The food was familiar Italians fare with slight adjustments to make it their own. Service is great throughout our meal. Prices are average. Except the appetizers which were almost the same price point as the entrees, but service makes up for it. Atmosphere would make for good casual date night, but still welcoming for families.",

    "text": "My mom brought the hubby, baby, and I here after spending time taking Christmas photos in the mall. We came here around 1PM and all ordered something light from their menu:  Mom: Calamari  Hubz: Spaghetti & Meatballs Baby: Milk (lol) Me: Shrimp Scampi - plain  As the waitress is taking our orders my husband asks the server what their craft beer is since the menu says, \"Ask your server for the craft beer list.\" She then responds with and kept repeating, \"I don't know why they have that on the menu, we do not have any craft beer.\" She didn't try to upsell him or offer any of the beers they actually did serve just kept repeating that they (the restaurant) should remove that off of the menu. Husband decided to order one of their Italian beers.   While we waited for our food to arrive, the server brought out bread & olive oil for us to munch on. The bread was amazing! It was baked with a variety of herbs and was baked to perfection - a little crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   Once our food arrived - which didn't take long considering around the time we were here there were about 10 people also dining in. All of our food came out correct and tasted OK. I kind of wish there were more shrimps in my shrimp scampi but other than that it was fine. The ingredients used to cook our meals were average - nothing to go home about and tell all your friends, basically.  I would say the restaurant's quality of food is a step higher than the Olive Garden. The good news is that none of us got heartburn after eating their food lol. If you are in the mall for several hours and do not want to eat their food court food, I would recommend this place.",

    "text": "Don't get the \"Pasta BRAVO!\" entree.  Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I think I can say that I've had enough good dishes to recommend this place. Located next to Dillard's and Larsen's Grill and facing Sunset Road, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana provides a sit-down option that's more upscale than other Galleria mall dining options such as Chevy's and Red Robin.  I had the complimentary rosemary focaccia on both occasions. It's soft and herbaceous, and it soaks up all the liquid you might want. Their house olive oil and vinegar is quite tasty, but I wasn't as impressed with the herbed red dipping sauce that they provided on my second visit.  I had Mama's Lasagna Bolognese ($17.99) during that first visit. It isn't exactly a traditional Italian lasagna. It's presented in an oval ceramic bowl, and it has an alfredo sauce and a Bolognese sauce, but it does have that gooey mozzarella on top, ricotta inside, and tasty ground beef spiced in an \"Italian\" way. There was a bit of a vegetable inside that give a crunch, and I enjoyed this as well. Oh, and the server hand-grates Parmesan cheese to top your lasagna to your liking. I had it 50% off on National Lasagna Day, and while I'm not sure how I feel about the full price value, I was quite happy with the deal.  The second time around, I focused on their happy hour menu. They call it \"Bar Bites\" and provide it in the bar / high top seating section 3:30-6:30pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends. I shared some appetizers with my friend because they're such a good deal.  The first app was Arancini ($3.95 Bar Bites price), which they describe as fried cheesy risotto. Maybe risotto is a bit off, and although they do invite comparisons to tater tots, they're very crunchy outside and creamy inside. They went well with either of the two dipping sauces, one a mildly spicy cream (\"diavolo\"), and the other a simple tomato sauce (\"pomodoro\").  The Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli ($4.95 BB) was perhaps more delicious. It has a similar blend of textures as the first app, but richer flavor from the mozzarella. It comes with a horseradish aioli and a marinara sauce. Again, everything was good.  The Spicy Bacon & Boursin Flatbread ($4.95 BB) sounded a lot better than it tasted. It should have been a home run with candied bacon, chared tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan spicy aioli, and green onions. It wasn't bad, but none of the components stood out.  Finally, we split that underwhelming Pasta BRAVO! ($15.99). Underseasoned if al dente rigatoni, underseasoned dry chicken, uninspiring mushrooms, and a decent roasted red pepper sauce needed all the help it could get flavor-wise, and I did have it in the form of leftover sauces from the apps. I just didn't think to use it until the last few bites, and it shouldn't be necessary. I'm disappointed that a dish that bears the restaurant name and is described as their \"signature dish\" was so underwhelming, but at least a $10-off-an-entree birthday credit via their myBRAVO rewards program took the sting out of the wallet.  I didn't have any service issues, especially not on today's visit. They took orders and delivered food promptly (all apps simultaneously, entree son enough afterward). Also, they processed discounts just fine. I was glad to see that the BOGO Bar Bites appetizer w/ Yelp check-in worked in addition to the $10 credit.  I avoided downgrading my rating to three stars because I would definitely come back to BRAVO! for cheap happy hour appetizers and the lasagna. Legit sit-down restaurants are few and far between in this area of Henderson near Sunset Station, but it looks like this sister restaurant of Brio Tuscan Grille has managed to fill a neighborhood niche, give or take one particular pasta dish.  (UPDATE 12/23/15: Visit #3. Had $10 credit again for some reason, so I went back to Bar Bites. My favorite tonight was the Bravo! Fries at $3.95, with well-seasoned fries, delicious crumbled bacon, gorgonzola, creamy horseradish aioli, and green onions cut on the bias. The Bravo! Burger at $5.95 is quite serviceable overall with American cheese, the same aioli as the above fries, and unadorned fries w/ a side of ketchup. I thought the bun was rather bready though, and the patty wasn't perfectly medium-rare throughout. The Crispy Shrimp Napoli, $5.95, was the most disappointing due to too-soft shrimp and a relatively tame/bland sauce.)",

The pasta was so under seasoned I  had to add salt and pepper. The pizza and flat bread were so salty it was hardly edible. My arugula was not washed thoroughly and I only know this because it was in a to go container and I had to wash it. Being that i live in Henderson I really want to support Bravo. With that being said, I booked a baby shower in June for 25 people and I am hoping that it won't be embarrassing. I know Brio is their sister restaurant and I actually would not mind driving there at this point. Maybe have an inservice day.  ***Updated Review **** met with Christy regarding the mix up . Tried another take out order yet again not even a month later. A \"manager\" by the name of Morgan 1) called my daughter a liar regarding a loyalty discount 2) Told me to \"come down in person to look at her computer , I don't have to talk to you call back tomorrow\" Here's the thing I do not know how this place is still open. The servers have bad attitudes, the food is lukewarm or cold and everyone looks miserable and sounds miserable working there. If you really hate your job don't work there. The negative energy transfers . This situation could have easily been diffused. Instead MORGAN wanted to be the BOSS. Good Luck to this establishment cause I will make sure everyone knows how \"great\" everything is. I would rather drive the 25 minutes in the other direction to Brio where you know the food will always be great along with the service.",

I expected the shrimp to be a decent size.  For the price all you get is the entree.  Soup or salad runs approx $4-$5 extra.  The bread was decent.  The oil the serve with it was good.  It had some mild spices in it.  They refilled the bread tray fast as well as offering to refill the drinks of those with me.  I only ordered water but they never came over to ask if I needed a refill.  I doubt if I would go there again or recommend it to anyone",

    "text": "First time going to this place for dinner with my mom and it was pretty tasty. We shared the eggplant and zucchini appetizer, which was alright. The best part was the white tangy sauce served on the side. Then we split one of their small salads with crunchy pasta, bacon bits and a creamy Parmesan dressing --that was delicious!   My entree was the grilled salmon and for me, it was cooked perfectly. Not dry at all, some may think it was a little undercooked but I had no problem with it. It was topped with asparagus and a balsamic glaze. Around the plate was spinach and bits of sweet potatoes and tomatoes. Overall, a very flavorful filling plate.   The only negative remark I have to make is that service was a bit slow at the beginning getting our waters and bread basket, but it was pretty busy when we first sat down.   Would come back again and try something else!",

    "text": "After a second visit to Bravo, I've become a fan. We had a satisfying first meal at lunch time, but weren't overly impressed. Our second meal left a more lasting, favorable impression. For the most part, we did not feel any of the growing pains that normally would be experienced from a newer restaurant. Bravo is solid option for us and a nice addition to the Galleria expansion.  It's was our fault the we had a pedestrian experience on our first visit mainly because my wife and I ordered pedestrian dishes. I had the fettuccine alla bolognese with a cup of wedding soup and my wife ordered the candied bacon burger. We split the bravo cheesecake for dessert. Everything was satisfactory but I did get a little perturbed from lack of communication by the kitchen because with my seat facing the kitchen, I witnessed the cook sell my pasta well before the burger was finished, leaving my entree to sit dying in the window for at least 7-8 minutes.  Our second visit was enjoyed outside on the patio with perfect weather. I recommend dining alfresco as you have a nice view of the newly built canopy with some palo verdes dominating the nice landscaping. My entree was the spicy scallop marinara and my wife ordered a Bravo chopped salad and the broiled tilapia with spicy tomato sauce. Although these items from the light menu were easy on the calories, they were heavy on the flavor. Comprised of many components, with sweetness from the scallops, tang from the artichokes, bitterness from the spinach, and heat from the sauce, the flavors were still well balanced and I was happy with my choice.  Service was excellent on both visits and everything ran smoothly without complication. Parking is directly in front of the restaurant so your walk won't be too far. There's also a happy hour which could be a possible getaway spot to grab a snack and a drink if the wife is dilly dallying in the mall for too long.",

    "text": "--CLIFFSNOTES OF THE BELOW REVIEW: Super yummy food, awesome wine, not that intimate, miiiiildly pricey (but doable)--  I went here with my two kids, which is already a test of its own, but it was a very positive experience. The atmosphere is not very intimate because there are limited numbers of booths, so mostly it's tables. Way better for a restaurant's bottom line, though. The outdoor seating is very appealing.   The bread before the meal was nice and not too much that it would spoil dinner - though my one-year-old kept opting for that instead of the chicken I gave him. Turd...  I got the chicken scaloppini and my 4-year-old got kids' spaghetti and an added meatball. The kids' podtion is the size of an adult plate of pasta, which is awesome, and the quality is just as delicious. However, the meatball cost an extra dollar. That sucked - but it was a huge meatball, too, so I get it.  My dish was phenomenal, and I was extremely impressed by how well-balanced it was. There are a ton of capers, tomatoes, mushrooms, multiple cheese varieties, plus the chicken and sauce. Capers can very easily overpower a dish, but the components here were all impressively complimentary of each other. It was straight up delicious.  The wine I had deserves its own paragraph. I had the 6oz Moscato with my dish. I was expecting just a mild white, but oooohhhhhhh boy was that yummy. I could have drank a bottle like it was juice and asked for more. Damn. Dangerous (in a good way)!  I didn't stay for dessert because I am single with kids and am poor. Plus it was bed time.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed the Bravo! Cucina Italiana in PA, so I was happy that the new Henderson location was just as good.  First, not actually part of this restaurant, but adjacent, the new outdoor area with the water feature looks lovely and compliments the restaurant nicely.  Second, the restaurant itself is a breath of fresh air and more upscale than the rest of the mall: from the white linens, to the decor, the high ceilings, and even the restroom!  We dined on Sunday afternoon, so both Lunch and Brunch menus were available.  We had a hard time deciding, so I went with a lunch salad and the BF ordered off the brunch menu.  We got:  The Romano-Crusted Chicken Salad $13.99: Crispy chicken breast over a chopped salad of lettuce, bacon, scallions, hard boiled egg, cucumbers, tomatoes, tossed in a Parmesan dressing.  Delicious and Huge, even when sharing!   And the Ham & Biscuit Benedict $9.99: Two poached cage free eggs, Cherrywood smoked ham, house made biscuit, topped with hollandaise. Served with brunch potatoes.  Also scrumptious!  The biscuit was soft and flaky, the ham & eggs were cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise was creamy and delicious. The potatoes were also fantastic.  A few notes:  -You can make reservations on Open Table or on their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bravoitalian.com%2Freservations.html&s=549eb835fe3ac9dd0580c4f1b7c77037d35a2ab962538565f2036ab1d8880b81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bravoitalian.com/reserva...</a> -Sister property to Brio, but they have separate Rewards programs.  Bravo's is basically $10 off your 6th visit - Also like Brio, they have a Bar Only food menu that starts at $3.95  - This is part of the Galleria Mall update/expansion, however they do not have an interior mall entrance, only an exterior parking lot facing entrance.",

We were greeted and seated immediately.    Our service here wasn't great.  Our waitress was a little off.  I had ordered a salad and she asked if I wanted a salad on the side.  Strange. During our meal it seemed as if she was avoiding our table.  We had to flag her down a few times for refills and the bill.    A complimentary Rosemary bread basket is brought to the table.  Our first basket was over-warmed so the bread was really hard.  The new basket was much better.  Just enough Rosemary gave this bread thumbs up from me.  For my meal I chose the Romano crusted chicken salad.  The chicken had a weird flavor with it also being dry.  I wasn't too thrilled about it.  We had also split the chicken spinach and bacon pizza.  This was a winner.  Delicious combination of flavors with a great crust.  I'd definitely recommend ordering this again.    Bravo was ok and I'd probably go back to try it again.  I just wasn't overly impressed.",

    "text": "So the first restaurant from the expansion of Galleria Mall aka The Plaza at Galleria is now open! Im lovin this place and all I've tried so far here at the new Bravo! Cucina Italiana was soup and salad!  Lobster Bisque and Bravo! Chopped Salad with shrimp was what I got since I didn't want anything to heavy to eat before I did some serious shopping.  The lobster bisque was thick, creamy, and rich tasting, but not rich in calories!!! UNDER 500 cal!!  And the chopped salad was equally delish especially with the shrimp (xtra item). The plump, buttery shrimp made the salad though and is worth the additional charge for it. My whole meal was under 1000 cal and worth every cent.    The menu that I scanned over had some entrees I look forward to try soon! There's a different menu offered during lunch, dinner and weekend brunch. From what I can tell, sandwiches are available during lunch only. Weekend brunch adds breakfast items like Berries & Cream French Toast and Sweet Potato Hash & Eggs!...mmmm  Kids menu available too.  The toddler who picked out chicken fingers meal liked her food. It came with a bowl of fresh berries too.  Ohh!! The complimentary ROSEMARY FOCACCIA bread with the olive oil dipping sauce!!! YUMMM to the second power!!    The setting here is just gorgeous classy,and relaxed. Love patio with the mature trees surrounding the area. This place is perfect to dine al fresco when it's not a windy day. There are a lot of tables in the dining areas but spaced far apart enough so you don't feel like someone is invading your space.   For a brand new place open less than a week, they sure have their act together.  Service was great! Staff was friendly.   Things to note: You can make table reservations online! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bravoitalian.com%2Freservations.html&s=549eb835fe3ac9dd0580c4f1b7c77037d35a2ab962538565f2036ab1d8880b81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bravoitalian.com/reserva...</a>  Sign up and take advantage of their rewards card system. 5 visit credits of $7.95 or more, 6 visit will be $10 off! Im sure your server will explain it to you.  Yes this Italian chain's sister restaurant is Brio Tuscan Grille. The slight similarities are the design/decor. Differences Bravo! more family style and family friendly.  Prices a tad lower too.   Access to this place is on Sunset Rd side.  Entrance from outside mall only since the Plaza at Galleria Mall is open air part of the mall. If you are in the mall go down the east hallway by Kohls. That was my only complaint, because there was no signs directing to where this place is inside the mall. We ended up at the new Larsens on the upper level. There is no wheelchair access outside  (to lower level)  either that I know of.  They close one hour after main mall closes at 10pm. Sundays till 9.",

Our entrees, Pasta Bravo and Lobster Ravioli were both good. We thought the portion size for the ravioli was small but it ended up being the perfect size. We had no room for dessert. We were in at around 3pm., so the restaurant was not busy. I probably would have been irritated at the noise level if the restaurant was full. Good \"in-between\" restaurant...not fast food and I think a bit better than Olive Garden for food and ambience.",

The shrimp is a must try. Jen and the manager came out periodicity to see how we were doing. Definitely will recommend.",

We ordered the strip steak, salad, soup desert, and drinks with a cost of $52.00 dollars When the meal was delivered the meal was served on one plate with a very small extra plate and one steak knife for us to share. The steak was so tough we could not eat it. When we told her, her statement was, well you did order it medium rare.

He took all the drink orders right away and even got the kids orders started immediately. Everyone had great things to say about their food. I ended up ordering shrimp scampi which was very good. Brian also brought out some dough for the kids to shape into anything they wanted and when they were finished he took the kids to bake the dough in the oven. He sat them down in front of the oven until done baking and then brought them back to the table. Very nice touch. Kids menu pizza and grilled salmon are big portions and a very good price as well.",

I see other server and bus boy chatting at the cooking station and no one to bother and ask if we need something to drink mind you it was 114 degree outside. I guess the hostess saw us getting irritated and came and ask.  We told her that no one stop by. She went to the cooking stations where the servers are and 4 of them just looked at each other.  It seems that no one knew who's table it is. Regardless of who's table they should have been working together as a team. They should got each others back.

Never brought a bread basket even though every other table had it except us. My aunts coffee was empty she had to ask for a refill several times.  When she did bring the bread after I asked for it of course.. she brought no bread plates.  The food was super bland no flavor at all.  Our food took about a good hour and a half to even come out. When it did was was cold.  The latte was cold. I could keep on going but honestly not worth it. What I suggest....teach your servers how to treat guests how to attend to them. Your dining experience is everything. Coming from a food and beverage background it was disappointing.",

My favorite party about the experience was the attitude and environment about the place.  Sometimes when we go out for happy hour the servers and bartenders have a less than pleasant demeanor because happy hour means inexpensive food/drinks, and people do not always tip well.  That was not the case for this restaurant.  You could see from the front door hostess stand to the busboys and everyone in between that it was a healthy work environment and people enjoyed working there and with each other.  P.S. Flatbread and molten chocolate dessert were AMAZING, must orders!",

Pretty standard Italian classics on the menu.   It just wasn't very good.   My fra diavolo came as chicken instead of shrimp, but that happens. Wouldn't even have knocked off a star, as they were quick to acknowledge and fix that. Well done there.   But it also didn't taste like much of anything. Suffice to say, it tasted like a really good lean cuisine, and about was about twice the size. Salt and cheese didn't help. The sauce had the look and texture of too much emulsifier in the recipe. And the pasta was over cooked.   Others in the group seemed pleased with their meals, enjoying the various Alfredo, Caprese, Scampi, and Parm options.   Not awful. Just hoping my family never decides to return. I'll never be back on my own, for sure. For $5-8 more I'd drive a couple miles to Ventano every time.",

Then we ordered and the cheese ravioli was cold, and the sauce was literally tomatoes and water. The chicken strips were like microwaveable ones from walmart for kids. We ordered another pasta because it was so disgusting it came out 2 minutes later, cold and so bland with no flavor. Probably the worst restaurant i've ate at! Talked to the manager and she was nice enough to not charge us for anything, and we didn't even eat... Do not recommend!",

Their happy hour consist of wines or cocktails from the house. Whichever you decide to get will be a hit! They also have a list of side dishes you can order (fried shrimp, flatbread, pizza dips, among many other) for a very reasonable price. I have pretty much tasted all of their happy hour menu items and there has not been one that I do not like. I would recommend trying the shrimp at least once because it is mouth watering.

The place was almost empty and we were seated right away. We then spent the next two hours being over looked. I watched four tables arrive after us, get appetizers, main courses and their bills before we were served. Two of my kids finally got their food. They ate, and my other two kids and my husband and I waited and waited. The waitress kept apologizing saying they were \"so busy.\" Yet, more people who came in after got their food.  It was ridiculous. We will never return. There are so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas and Henderson, that there is no need to return to a place where service is so poor and unorganized. Very disappointed. And any server with an once of customer service would have comped an appetizer or something. Not that it matters, I would have much rather had decent service. She would have never done that to adults, serve 1/3 of the table while the rest of us sat and watched them eat.",

We came during happy hour, they offer a Moscow Mule, I cannot have vodka so I asked if they can do a Mexican or Irish and the Bartendar said NO?  When I asked why she said it's because it comes out of the inventory and they are very strict with their inventory.  So even though the food is decent, this is not a place I will come back to for happy hour.  The lack of consistency may make it that I stop coming here altogether, because like other Yelp reviews, you are expecting to come find something and what you find is change....  Change is good however, when you take certain foods off the menu or you cannot deviate from a happy hour drink because of an allergy, the customer does not come first, the bottom dollar and inventory is apparently more important to them then customers coming in and enjoying themselves...  The above was a previous visit, now from today...when the menu says mixed greens, in the store it's normally a Spring Mix, NOT HERE!  This salad with mixed greens was Chopped Romain Lettuce mixed with everything else??  I guess that's mixed greens???  Sadly after tonight's visit this place will be off our list for good.  I still encourage other Yelpers to give this place a try and write your review with your honest opinion.",

The food was absolutely amazing! The service and the way we were made to feel unwelcome was awful! We arrived at 745pm I was not aware that they close at 9pm, I did feel we had plenty of time for dinner. We were given our drinks and they placed a bread basket on the table we loved it so asked for more bread the server sighs and says I'll have to see if there is anymore. He brings another basket out. After we finished dinner I reminded the server about the birthday celebration and asked for the dessert menu, the server raised his eye brows immediately checked his watch and said okay and slowly stretched out the word okay. When he came back with the dessert menu my guests asked for coffee and the servers said sorry it was all thrown out already. We ordered our desserts the server was clearly annoyed, he only came back to the table to bring the check no mention of our birthday celebration I still don't understand why he would write it on the check. Like I said the food is amazing but I would not go back from the service .",

When another couple was seated in the booth next to us, our server rushed over to them and asked them if it was their first time. She also asked them if they wanted more bread. Our server barely acknowledged us. She never asked us if we wanted more bread nor whether we enjoyed our meal.  We are very disappointed at the inconsistency in attention she pays to her customers, and this will be our last visit here. You're better off going to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill.",

She selected because of \"Outrageous Pork Chops!\" When we ordered, she switched to Salmon. She said it was very good but she wished she had stayed with her first choice. Appetizer Spinach Dip, fabulous. Lobster Bisque, very good. Salads; Caesar and House, also very good. Freshly baked loaves of bread and butter and a delicious dipping oil. I had Spaghetti Bolognese. It was more dry than I like. They replaced it with a freshly made entree with a perfect, for me, amount of meat sauce. Snafu when Eggplant Parmesan  and Chick Pomodoro were delivered by another server. They were switched on the cart. Grated Parmesan Cheese was mistakenly placed on the eggplant. The chicken dish was delivered to the eggplant diner, who immediately sprinkled it with red pepper flakes. When error was discovered, the diner who ordered chicken was sensitive to peppers and the eggplant diner terribly allergic to Parmesan cheese. The entrees were quickly remade, delivered, and judged exceptional. The first set of incorrect entrees were kindly packaged to take home. One of the managers was Veronica, who handled everything perfectly. Another manager, didn't get his name, was also there to make certain all was taken care of. After dinner, they delivered a chocolate cake a la mode with a birthday candle. Table clothes, napkins, dishes, utensils were spotlessly clean and fresh. Floors and kitchen area also extra clean. We will be back. This time, my wife will get the Pork Chops.",

And it wasn't my usually Italian food snobbery.  I started with the lobster bisque.  Lobster bisque can be a risky move, but done right, oh, I am in heaven.  It was so good.  I nearly licked the bottom of the bowl.  Some shrimp chunks.  Not salty.  Yum!  I had the most amazing salad!  Mediterranean Roasted Veggie Salad.  Oh it was a taste explosion.

Granting it was Christmas Eve and maybe she was at the end of her shift and was in a rush to go home but still not a reason for her to be offensively impolite to us. Place was not even full and saw only about 4-5 tables filled. Didn't want to throw in the race card since we were Asians but really felt discriminated by her attitude towards us. Not to mention food was salty and not as tasty as we have expected based from the reviews I also kept the receipt as she even made a mistake in my bill and not even apologetic about it  All in all...Horrible experience!

Bring on the olive oil and balsamic! Mmmmm.  I opted for a 2 course entree consisting of a Caesar salad and bacon wrapped balsamic meatloaf. The salad was outstanding. A good solid Caesar dressing and croutons that taste homemade. I have no clue what prompted me to get meatloaf but it was a home run for sure. I'm not a bacon person so I picked that off but the meatloaf was cooked to perfection and seasoned wonderfully. The balsamic glaze married so well with the beef. It came with a side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes and hericot vert (which I learned was basically very thin green beans) The potatoes were slightly cold but the green beans were excellent. The proverbial cherry on top was the crispy onion straws on top of the meatloaf. Fried onions...you can't go wrong.  As if dinner wasn't good enough, my big mouthed friend (kidding!) let the server know that it was my birthday and they offered a complimentary dessert of my choice from the entire dessert menu. No kid sized birthday freebies here. We chose the caramel mascarpone cheesecake. It was good. Nothing out of this world but good.  The restaurant itself is a mixture of tables and booths and it has a large bar area as well. We came on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. Our server was great, although she did a weird disappearing act after dinner that made us wait a bit too long for the check.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes at Bravo. It was a great experience all around. Bravo! Indeed!",

Cesar B. was our server and did a phenomenal job - personable, knowledgeable, perceptive, and quick on refills. Rosemary bread basket and dip were fantastic. Both my wife and I ordered the White Peach Palmer (white peach syrup with tea & lemonade) and loved it! Just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp. It tasted as good as it looks in the pics, excellent flavor and rich creamy sauce. My wife ordered the Pasta Woozie dish. The sauce and pasta tasted great and the large spinach leaves tossed in added to the flavor and texture. Both our dishes were part of a three course meal special. For about $17/$18 each we got a large Caesar salad (one of the best I've tasted), the main dish, and a small dessert (peanut butter brownie & chic chip canoli were great). Great value and great experience...will definitely be back!",

I was a bit worried because our last visit we had to flag down people to get drinks refilled. Not this time our glasses were never even near empty. So besides the amazing service the food was really very good. Highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. We split a house salad. Which was cold and crisp. My Husband had the pasta Fra Diablo, he liked it but I think he liked mine better I had the pasta Bravo and it was sooo good. I think my only criticism would be the cheese grating oh my goodness it took forever and a lot of muscle for the poor lady who served us our entree. I told her they should get the crank grater. It would be so much easier. Management news flash diners like Parmesan on their pasta. This is not the place to try and save money with stingy cheese graters. I would definetly recommend Bravo. Hopefully you'll be as lucky as we were and get Manuel as your server.",

My group hadn't seen each other in a while so it took us a while to look through the menu. She was very helpful at recommending and making substitutions for our table. I ended up ordering the 5oz filet and I was pleasantly surprised by how tender it tasted. Very melt in my mouth.. Yum! I would definitely order it again.

And the Chicken Marsala need more spices for flavor.  It was a nice surprise that by just checking in on Yelp, the restaurant offered you a free appetizer.   However, only valid in the \"bar and lounge\" area only.  So with our party of 16 in the dining area, the offer was not valid.  Too bad, would've given an extra star for the nice gesture.   Most likely would not dine here again.  Other Italian places in town way better in Town Square or at Fashion show mall.",

    "text": "My oldest niece, Jessa, was visiting from Utah and she loves Italian food. Plus, being a teenager she also loves the mall. So I knew Bravo would be the perfect place to take her and my other niece Jannaliese (who's 7).  Bravo has been on my radar since they have been upgrading the Galleria mall. I've heard many good things from the Yelp community about this place.   We went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and they had a semi busy lunch crowd. The hostess seated all three of us quickly. Our waiter was there in a flash with water and a kids menu for Janna. He asked if we had been there before and since we had not he explained the lunch specials. Plus, on that particular day it was national lasagna day and they were serving a full portion for half price. What a great deal!   We all looked at our menus and decided on what to get. I loved the kids menu for Janna. She had lots of options and she could color on her menu. They included games that kept her busy and even her own kids cup. My niece Jessa ordered the Pasta Woozie which  was their version of Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and spinach. Jana ordered the Chicken Fingers off the kids menu and I had the Lobster Bisque. After taking our order our waiter brought us some delicious breadsticks that were more of a focaccia bread with a flavored oil to dip them in. While we were waiting for our lunch our waiter brought Jana out some pizza dough to play with and make into whatever she wanted. After she was done they will bake it for her.   Our food came out in a reasonable time seeing that it was lunch time and they were starting to fill up. Jessa's was a large bowl to tasty looking noodles, sauce and chicken. Which was really was excellent. The sauce had a great cheesy bite to it. Jana's Chicken Fingers were made with actual chicken and it even came with fries and fruit. Just a suggestion check the blueberries! There were several that I had to pick out for her that were rotten or just not edible. My Lobster Bisque had great flavor despite its unsavory appearance. It had obviously been sitting out while my nieces food was finishing being cooked because it had a film on the top after sitting. It was garnished with some bay shrimp which did add a nice texture difference in the creamy soup.  When we were given back Jana's pizza dough masterpiece we all quickly realized that it was not the art piece she had made, but another child's. Since she wasn't supposed to eat it I didn't make a big deal about it.   The atmosphere is definitely fancier then the food court at the mall. Bravo is covered in dark woods and high vaulted ceilings. Both my nieces kept saying how fancy it was. The service was just ok. I know our waiter tried, but fell short a bit. Waiting for our check and my card took a lot longer then it needed to.   I came in expecting to love Bravo and I left thinking it was ok. There are a few things they still need to work out being that they are still new. But things like rotten blueberries are just not ok to me. I'll definitely give this place another shot in the future.",

The dipping sauce wasn't your typical olive oil and vinegar, it had some type of dried tomato bits in there.  I actually enjoyed it.  My friends and I devoured the bread easily.   The waitress said the plates were pretty big, and was easily sharable with two people so a couple of friends split an an entree. I however, didn't think it was that big of a plate.  When I go to other italian restaurants, I usually only eat about a third of a plate, here I finished like 4/5 of my plate.  I'm not sure if I was just really hungry, or if the plates seem smaller.    I got the shrimp pasta in the \"diavalo\" sauce and it was delicious! It had a nice kick to it.  I think it tastes similar to the alla vodka sauce, but it had a taste of some herbs and a little spice which i prefer over the simple creaminess of the alla vodka.  I very much enjoyed my meal and would recommend it!",

Now to the service..  Bravo only opened two and half weeks ago.  We have to give them that, however, the bartenders were having personal conversations and I had to interrupt to get my wine glass refilled and again to settle our bill.  The manager came over to assist the bartenders with something and she even seemed a bit frazzled with how they were joking around.  The bartenders didn't know how to process the coupon we had so the manager had to come over to do this.   When we got up to leave neither manager thanked us that we had serve us during the interaction however the bartender that was taking over took the time to do so which we appreciated.

When we arrived  at 3:00pm there was no wait and a decently empty restaurant. We were offered to sit inside or outside and chose outside patio since the weather was nice. We sat and waited about 15 minutes to be acknowledged and finally a server in that area approached us and was surprised that we hadn't been helped. She took our drink order and brought some bread right away and apologized for the wait. I ordered one of their \"signature\" dishes which was pretty much spinach and chicken alfredo, my son ordered noodles and alfredo. When the food arrived I was impressed ok the presentation and quality. The noodles appear to be house made and everything tasted great. The only thing I would say is that the service was a bit slow. From being greeted to getting our check everything took a bit longer than it should have. I will say that the server we had was very apologetic which brought the review up from 3 stars. Overall I will definitely be back. Prices and quality were good!",

They were nice enough to let us sit in the dining room and still get happy hour since it was my dad's 92nd birthday and he couldn't climb up on the stools in the bar area. By checking in on here, we got a free happy hour appetizer and ordered the fried ravioli. It was actually pretty good. We also ordered a coupke of drinks. The white peach sangria is nice and refreshing.   For dinner, we ordered the chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan and the linguine carbonara. They were all delicious. Good size portions too. If you order the carbonara, order it with the fried egg. I never heard of anybody putting an egg on it, but they give you rhat option and it's actually really good. The bread they give you to snack on is good too.   Lastly, since it was his birthday, they let him choose a dessert, lit a candle and brought it over. He got the creme brulee and it was so good. The staff was all super nice. Always came to check on us and make sure we were good on everything.",

    "text": "I just got back from a Friday Night dinner (6:30 pm) with a group of 15.  My family was celebrating my cousin's graduation tonight in one of the private rooms reserved for group dining.  I was sooo curious to see how the waitress was going to handle my outspoken family.  Almost, like watching a family member introducing their bf/gf to the family for the first time. I'll be rating my experience from a family style dinner perspective that my uncle paid for, awesome.  Service: 5/5 The waitress assigned to us was fantastic.  Amazing attitude, high energy, moved with a sense of urgency to take care of our group.  She had a busser who assisted with clearing the plates, but she took care of us from beginning to end while simultaneously taking care of her tables in the main room.  One of the best servers I've come across this year.  She was also so patient with our numerous photo requests. The manager stopped by to make sure everything was ok and said goodbye to us individually when we left.  We appreciated that and thanked him for a great time.  Food: 4/5 Big platters of food was served to us family style in our room. Here's what I had:   Focaccia bread: Was fresh and very good.  Very impressed right off the bat. Chopped Salad: Fresh, tasty and just the right amount of dressing.   Chicken Marsala: Chicken was juicy and the sauce was tasty with the right amount of mushrooms Pasta Bravo: My favorite dish.  Pasta was prepped perfectly, the roasted red pepper cream was fantastic.  I went through 3 servings like I was carb loading for a marathon. Shrimp Scampi Pasta: Once again, scored with the sauce and pasta and a good amount of shrimp.   Creme Brulee: Great custard and the sugar crust. Solid. Warm Chocolate Cake: I'm not really a chocolate person, but when the chocolate isn't too sweet and there isn't an overwhelmingly chocolaty taste, I'm down.  This was just that, perfect   Value:  I didn't pay, but my Uncle who did said the price was fair considering the excellent service and the tasty food.  Not one complaint from a group of 15 who can be amateur food critics at the drop of a dime.  Ambiance: 4/5 Our private group dining area was pleasant.  I really appreciated the oversized plates used for dinner.  It made it easy to pile on the different pastas in one sitting.  Of course I'll find a way to still eat multiple plates regardless, but I digress.  Summary: I was thoroughly impressed with this dining experience, blown away.  I can't reiterate how pleasant our server was.  My aunties are quick to let people know if they think they're doing something wrong, and they were all saying how impressed they were with everything about the group dinner tonight.   This was my first visit here and I plan on coming back to see how a conventional dinner or happy hour will work out.  Pasta Bravo, some drinks will definitely be part of my updated review in the near future.  Bravo! Bravo Cuciana Italiana..see what I did there? =)",

    "text": "We have been frequent diners at Bravo since it opened a few years ago, it has become our go-to date night destination. Henderson is sorely lacking in Italian food choices, so it was a welcome addition to the area.   When we dined there last we ordered the Chicken Parmigiana, which we always do. It's been the best thing on the menu. Unfortunately, they changed the way they make it, and it was very disappointing. We realize that happens on occasion, and the establishment has the right to change up dishes. We asked our server if we could order it the old way next time we visit- he checked and let us know it was not possible.   I'm not sure how often we will come back now, we found out that several other favorite dishes are gone as well. They don't have the sausage eggplant roll up, the chopped salad, or the toasted ravioli either. The lasagna is good... sometimes. I've had it burnt on the edges or cold in the middle on a few different occasions, so I hesitate to order it. So that makes me want to come back less.   The food is still good, but what has made it crave-able is gone. The new dishes are okay, but not worth the price. If you just want noodles, it's a good option, but the choices are going downhill.   I will say: the service has ALWAYS been top-notch. It's just the food that disappoints me.",

    "text": "I've visited this place a few times and decided to finally get around to writing a review. I didn't even know of the Bravo restaurant chain until I came to this one in Henderson.  If I had to sum up this place, I would say that it is a classy looking restaurant with a casual and friendly atmosphere.  The few times that I have been here, one of the managers - Adam would always come around and check on us a couple times throughout the meal to make sure everything was going well. He's got to be one of the friendliest people I've ever met. You can tell that he's a very family oriented person - he was very accommodating of our two sons and even went as far as helping us pack our leftover meals to go himself because we had our hands full.   The menu is a 1 pager, but in my opinion - the best restaurant perfect the items on their limited menus! Their pizza is a hit with the kids, and their lobster bisque has got to be some of the best I've ever had. It's thick and has actual chunks of lobster in it, you can't beat it.   I've had their Chicken Parmesan (which is a huge portion) and their carbonara with sunny side egg cracked on top (my favorite). I've never left this place hungry.   They even give out pieces of dough for the kids to play with - they can create their own shapes and they'll bake it for you!  Great food, great service, great price. I'm giving this place a 5. Keep up the good work Adam!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place this evening after doing some shopping. It's conveniently located in the Galleria at Sunset.  We missed happy hour by 10 minutes. Weren't able to see what they had but the bar seemed packed when we got there at 6:40. Happy hour is 3:30 to 6:30.  We were greeted by the hostess and then sat down at one of the booths. Overall the decor is nice. Slightly nicer than the standard Italian chain. Menu is simple and minimal. They have he staples like fried calamari, pizzas, lasagna, and chicken beef and fish.  They start you off with a focaccia style bread and spicy olive oil. Pretty tasty.   We decided to go with the pasta trio featured on their 25 year anniversary menu. Comes with the lasagna, pasta diablo with either chicken or shrimp and 2 cheese ravioli. No sides. My friend added a chopped salad for 4.99 and I added the the lobster bisque for 5.49.  I gave the lobster bisque a solid 5/5. Sweet, buttery and definitely tasty. Wasn't much lobster though. Actual meat. Maybe 2 small pieces but for the price it was one of the best bisques I've had. The chopped salad was also good. A solid 4/5. Looked like a traditional Greek salad. Feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers and black olives.  Our mains were the disappointment. Lasagna definitely sadly fell short. Looked like they forgot a few layers. It was almost as flat as the ravioli. The lasagna and the ravioli were on the ends of the plate. For whatever reason they were cooler than the pasta diablo in the center. I think the plate the pasta at the end and have the ravioli and pagan pre made and portioned and set before. All 3 were just ok. This is where it went from a nicer chain to the standard Olive Garden. Gave our dishes 2/5. The chicken on my friends pasta was dry and my previously frozen shrimp were chewy.   Overall good atmosphere, service was par and the ambience was nice. Just seemed to fall short on the mains. May try it again for the happy hour.",

The kids menu includes a build your own pasta plus many other options, they were huge plates at a great price!  I had the lasagna...  yummy, a smaller bechamel lasagna with a small amount of ricotta/ meat, it was delicious.  I loved it!  My friend had the scampi pasta,  it was lemony but she wanted more spice, but was happy with it.  Definitely a great value for the quality/size of food!",

    "text": "My boyfriend was able to conveniently make a reservation for two on their website. It wasn't too busy when we arrived (around 6:00pm on a Saturday) so we were seated rather quickly.   Leisha was quick to greet us and get our drink orders then gave us a couple minutes to look over the menu. She was able to answer questions we had about certain dishes and gave us suggestions about an appetizer.   They brought out warm bread and some sort of oil to dip it in (you can buy it in a bottle for $7 and some change if you really like it!)  We ordered calamari to start -- presentation was beautiful, not heavily battered, sauces were delicious (creamy horseradish and marinara). Definitely recommend!   My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken & sun-dried tomato goat cheese with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken looked dry but it definitely was not! It's an interesting (but still good) taste, so try it if you're adventurous.   I ordered the Parmesan crusted beef medallions... omg it was delicious! Recommend, recommend, recommend! The Parmesan crust on top of the three beef medallions was like a cherry on top of ice cream. Then there was this potato medley -- sweet potatoes and crispy potatoes with onions and bacon. Heavenly!   I'll come back again, but maybe not to spend $24 on three beef medallions. It was good to try, though!",

    "text": "Bravo Cucina Italiana is awesome.  This is my second time here.  Their grilled Pork Chop is definitely what makes us come back.  We ordered that the first time we came here and was amazed with the flavor and tenderness of the pork.  I hope that it stays that way always!  Each time I talk about this place or recommend it, I always recommend people order the Pork Chops.    The first time we came here, we also did happy hour and tried the meatballs which was full of flavor but, to my liking was just ok.  Today we ordered off the happy hour menu and we tried the Crispy Shrimp Napoli which I enjoyed.  That too was full of flavor.  I also ordered the White Peach Sangria which if you like fruity and sweet drinks, this is perfect.  It wasn't insanely sweet.    The first time here, for my main course I tried the Pasta Fra Diavolo w/ Chicken which I barely ate because my pasta was dried and the flavor just wasn't there for me. This one dish alone hasn't stopped me from coming back.    Not only is the food good here but so is the atmosphere and their employees!  Great service all around.   So with that being said! Happy Eatings!",

    "text": "Ok so I came back for a 3rd time. I am pleased to give this site 4 stars. I am a bit partial to this place. There were some things I believe could have been better but overall this place is working hard to get better and it shows. A good tip would be to not visit between 4 and 5. I think that was my issue the last 2 times. I came in around 4pm the last 2 times and I think it might be a change over in shifts or close to it. This time I came in around 5:30 pm and it was quite a bit different. Let's begin. We came in and again seating was NOT a problem. The place is clean and ambiance is perfect. We were sat quickly and our server did show up and take our order promptly and was a good server. I think the only thing I didn't like about the server was he had 2 nose rings in. I know people that may be old school and isn't a big deal to most but I just don't think it's appropriate for a food establishment, other than that he was great. Attentive, quick and not annoying. Let's get to our orders. We ordered the Calamari for appetizers. My wife chose to have the Lobster Ravioli for her entree and I chose the Parmesan crusted beef Medallions (my order came with sweet potato hash and asparagus.) The calamari was brought promptly and looked amazing. A different sauce on each side separated by a wall of calamari. This dish was amazing. We are partial to the white sauce. Our food was delivered and it must have just finished as it was hot (which i LOVE). My wife really did like her raviolis and her only complaint was she didn't taste much Lobster, but other than that it was great. Now my dish...... so let's start with the not so good part of it. The asparagus were just sad. Flimsy, dull and not flavorful. My sweet potato hash was ok. I really like the subtle rosemary and Italian seasoning on it. The part that wasn't good is the cookery of it. Because the hash was chopped with all different types of sizes of potato there were some that were raw, cooked part of the way, some overcooked and others perfect. I don't know if it comes that way or not but in order to get uniformity and avoid that they need to be the same size. Now the star of the show BEEF!!! Finally the star was truly the star. The Beef had a nice char to it and was COMPLETELY tender with a nice Parmesan crusted top.  Whoever cooked this dish should get a High five, 2 fist pumps and a HELL YEAH!!! BRAVO BRAVO!!!!! Way to make it a come back!",

As I walked in at around 1:30pm today, 11.10.16, the hostess never greeted me just turned her head like she was having a bad day.  I thought about turning around, but instead headed to a friendlier bar.    Yul, name on the receipt, was my bartender.  Quick & super nice as I got an very important phone call so was pretty much on the phone from then on & still placed my order w/o interruptions.  The bar area was empty once again.  I usually wouldn't be on the phone like this either, but had Yul pick my 'pick two' salad & pasta entree.  He picked the chopped salad, which I always get at Brio.. it was good.  I picked through it, but not crisp lettuce at all.  Not like Brio.  And the linguine carbonara, which I love peas so that was good too, a little on the soupy sauce side.  Good is not great.    Service was great this time & he seemed like he enjoyed being there too, not like I've witnessed before w/ their employees.  Will give them an extra star for service.  And one for the tasty olive oil w/ pepperoni & focaccia bread that I could've just eaten as an entree.",

The wine was good and the pasta was outstanding! The Woozie was wowza!  To make the dinner even more spectacular was Rhonda!  She was our waitress and wine and food advisor... and she put the dinner over the top! (Ask for her!)  We will be back! Often!",

Their NY steak was quite good, but unfortunately their Pasta Bravo was a huge disappointment for my wife! This might've been the most plain, ordinary pasta we've ever had, with only a hint of grilled chicken and mushrooms described in the menu, and barely any sauce. Just plain and dry, something you'd expect at a lowest grade restaurant. We're actually in disbelief and not sure if we'll forget this bad experience easily.",

    "text": "Just had dinner here with my husband and we are leaving happy and full. For a Friday night this place was not busy. We missed happy hour by a few minutes, but was still able to click on the Yelp check in and redeem an appetizer for a future visit. The menu here is not big and even offered gluten free options. We started off with the calamari. It came with  horseradish sauce and marinara sauce. The calamari was not as crispy as I usually like it, but the breading to protein ratio was good and seasoned appropriately . I wish the horseradish sauce would have more tang to it, but I enjoyed mixing the two sauces.  My husband decided to do their promotion which was a two course meal starting at $12.99 that included a entree and salad. He got the shrimp scampi pasta and chopped salad. The salad was a good size. I enjoyed the red wine vinegar dressing, but felt it was drenched a little more than I liked. The pasta was good. It came with angel hair and garlic bread. I thought the sauce was a little peppery, but I added lemon which made it taste so much better. I knew I wouldn't want a whole meal so I decided to try their meatball and polenta appetizer as my meal. But in all honesty, we were so full after eating the calamari and the complimentary herb bread that I barely touched the meatball. I did try it and I loved the polenta. It was perfectly seasoned and had a great consistency. The marsala glaze was good with the meatball. All in all this place is good. I do agree the service could be a little better, but our server did try. I was more upset at the fact that she didn't ask if we wanted bread or dessert. We had to ask for ourselves. But she did make great recommendations, so thank you!",

The server suggested the chicken Marsala so I ordered that. The sauce was okay but the chicken was as thin as a pancake and only one half breast. For 14.99 I don't think it was worth it. It came with a high blob of mashed potatoes so I guess I was supposed to fill up on those and not the chicken.  Next time I'll go elsewhere.",

We had Rebecca, she was attentive to our not knowing the menu, helped with recommendations after we told her our tastes and was great at checking back to ensure we were happy and getting the experience we wanted.  She should really train some of the others there as we saw some who could use her skills.  The bread was to die for, pasta was cooked perfectly and one of us had a filet steak and it was better than most of the steak places in the area.

We ordered the calamari as a starting appetizer. This was maybe one of the best calamari I have ever had. The Focaccia bread tasted fresh and it's dipping sauce tasted amazing. I was getting kind of full already so I decided to try the Grilled Salmon pasta. The salmon was flavorful and the pasta was light. We couldn't decide on the dessert so we ended up getting the dessert trio. It included vanilla creme brulee, chocolate brownie and a cannoli. The desserts made my taste buds explode and my stomach happy. They were still warm like it came out of an oven and didn't taste bland at all.  The only complaint I had was our waiter taking too long. We could see there was a mini meeting going on, but can't it wait till later? I think it took 20 minutes to ask and receive our check. The busser even asked if we got our check yet. Our waiter could of at least said I'm sorry for the wait or something like that.  Overall, I would come back for the food. Service needs a little improvement though.",

Everyone ordered something different and we all loved our food..so delicious and large portions. Bravo is clean.. and could be even romantic if you visit with someone special.  We sat around the fireplace and Becca took a group photo of us all.   Well Done Bravo !!! I will be returning soon to celebrate my husband's birthday. He's going to love those huge yummy pork chops.",

But don't go for the drinks - go for the food. Nothing skinny about this food. It's just like mamma Mia made. Great portions. Dinner tonight, leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Great bread with super lite olive oil.",

    "text": "Meh... Nothing spectacular. Me and my husband came here for our anniversary, we ordered their Pasta Fra Diavolo and it was alright. Nothing to write home about. The waitress we had gave me attitude when I showed her the Yelp check-in free appetizer and that soured my mood instantaneously. Our daughter came with us on our anniversary dinner (lack of a babysitter) and ordered a salad and spaghetti. They brought her the wrong salad and when they finally brought out the right one, it came out with main dish so it was wasted.. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the dessert trio was on FLEEK! My favorite part of the entire experience. But all in all, if we want Italian we are better off just going to Olive Garden.",

The dining room was really nice toblook at but we were so disappointed. Went in tonight and it wasn't very busy. We were seated quickly, but the dining room was uncomfortably cold (and I always complain places are too hot!)   The service was not great, we had to ask to have our drinks refilled several timed. Waited a long time for them to be refilled and they had so much ice in them they were gone with only a few sips. The bread basket was never offered to be refilled and my daughter asked for a plain cheese pizza and it came with pepperchini on it (not something a kid wants to eat)  By far the worst was my steak...it was ordered medium and came  rare. I sent it back and a few minutes later the same piece of meat came back barely medium, no apology.   For the four of us, main dishes only (2 kids, two adults) with only sodas the bill was 80 dollars.   Bottom dollar, ok food, but kitchen needs to learn how to cook a steak, turn up the heat in the dining room, get more waitstaff and reevaluate the price point!",

They just happened to have a summer special 3 course, where we got a soup, main course, and dessert.   We had to pay extra for our lobster bisque. It had good flavor but they had shrimp instead of lobster. I would recommend the pasta fra diavolo with shrimp, which had a good level of spiciness to it.  We also tried their Romano crusted chicken salad which was way too overdressed for my liking. Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side.    I was disappointed with our cannoli crumble that we got. It tasted like whipped cream with chocolate chips. Would give this 3.5 stars for ok service, inexpensive casual dining, and large portions. We still want to come back and check out their happy hour menu.",

They do not seat right away or they give the booth you requested away to guests that walk in.. They stand there and talking away and have no care in the world you made a reservation..!This has happened twice.. Mothers Day we know it was busy but when other parties are being seated and you are still waiting 20 minutes for a table you made a reservation a month ago, and the hostess just standing are talking away.. This is one of the reasons I have not returned since that day..  I would of not made this complaint, but called a reservation in on a Tuesday 8/9 and Checked in with the hostess asked for a booth.. Said the next booth would be cleaned and ready. Another guest walked in without a reservation and they wanted a booth and the hostess took them to the booth I was waiting for.. I spoke to the hostess and told her what happened Mothers Day.. Oh I am sorry.. and explained that is one of the reasons I have not returned.. Another party was getting up from the booth we will give you that one..!  Oh well.. I am sorry about that.. It was why make a reservation you get seated faster without one..    I gave my server my Bravo card, never logged my reward card.. This was twice.. Why have a card if the staff doesn't care to log your points.. I noticed it when I dined the next time which was  8/15 and was seated right away for the first time without a reservation .. Very nice Hostess and in a booth..  It was my Son's Birthday.. The server was so very sweet.. The kitchen over seasoned his steak so we had to wait to have the steak redone.. While I sat there with my food.. The manager came over to apologize.. and offered him a salad..We were offered a Birthday dessert.. Twice I have dined no bread was offered.. Had to ask for bread  with dinner never received any for lunch when I dined when I asked the server..It was sad that this had to happen on his Birthday.. I really did not want to come back here to dine here.. But he picked this place for his Birthday.. You have great food & service is good.. I am just not sure I will be back anytime soon..",

We had the following:  Chicken, Spinach & Bacon Flatbread $8.49  Grilled Chicken & Candied Bacon Sandwich $11.49  Scallop Marinara $13.49  The flatbread was great. The bread was quite thin and crispy while I could taste all the ingredients also. My wife said her scallop dish was good, nice and spicy. I tasted it and the only thing was that the artichoke slices in the dish didn't need to be there. They were a little chewy and made the overall texture of the dish awkward. And by the way, the scallops were baby scallops and not those ones you see in fancy restaurants. My sandwich tasted good and the accompanying, well-seasoned sweet potato fries were probably one of the best fries I've tasted here in vegas. Note to yelpers: Don't order the chicken flatbread appetizer and chicken sandwich as they have basically the same ingredients. Overall, I'd say this was a nice experience.",

Got the meatballs and polenta that was tender and tasty but lukewarm in temperature- I thought they were made to order or at least heated to safe food temperature. Italian meatball soup was good with plenty of mini meatballs and some vegetables. Saw the fire oven and ordered a spinach chicken pizza. Crust was thick and mildly chewy and had a spinach dip like sauce on top with some chicken, cheese and bacon- great combo of flavors.  Server didn't check on us promptly after the food was delivered, but was good on refilling drinks. Food runners deliver your food, so you always have to raise your hand to claim the dish you ordered- it would be nice to not have to do that at a restaurant that is priced more than Olive Garden.",

Not the rings and tentacles I've had at every other Italian restaurant.   My son and I had the Spaghetti Cacio Pepe and added chicken to it. Very small portion and the chicken was somewhat burnt and dry.   My wife was disappointed because they no longer had her favorite pasta dish with scallops, so she opted for something else which was just so so. Sorry, I can't remember the name.

Just a pile of lettuce, croutons, and some chicken on top My partners grilled shrimp, as she puts it, \" not very Italian, but tasty\". 4 stars for the venue. Open, full of light, and even when it's crowded, not noisy. Also very clean. 5 stars for our server. Always checking on us with a big smile on her face. Excellent service. 2 stars for the person working the front of the house that seats you. Never said a word when we were seated. And when we left, she was just staring out the window, never said anything.  In a zone. Overall, I might go back and try something else at some point. As a local who has lived here for over 21 years, if your  looking for real authentic Italian food, in my opinion, there are many better options close by.",

No hostess to greet the patrons walking in. And literally a handful of people in the restaurant. It was a ghost town. We waited a few minutes before someone came to seat us. We ordered calamari. IT WAS TERRIBLE. We sent it back because it was literally breaded strips that tasted like sponge and there were only about 8 pieces. It was the worst I've ever had. They removed that from the bill. I think what was so disappointing is that a manager didn't even come out to speak to us. Judging from the reviews, this last week there were clearly some issues. As a manager, it would have been nice if you would have came by and apologized. Just left a bad taste in my mouth -- literally and figuratively. Was actually considering using them for a large party this summer, no thanks.",

I got a decent size bowl of watery bolognese. I just was not impressed for the price and expectations from the menu. She never offered cheese and I had to flag her down for it.

    "text": "This place had so many amazing reviews so I figured that I'd give it a go last night with my sister. I ordered the filet mignon which (per the menu) came with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus. I paired my filet with the lobster bisque. My sister ordered the lobster ravioli which (per the menu) came with shrimp and she paired her dish with a caprese salad.  Our soup and salad arrived; I've never had lobster bisque so I had no complaints about it. It was creamy and delicious. My sisters caprese salad was plated nicely and the balsamic glaze smelled so sweet. My sister and I had no complaints ... until the entrees arrived.   My filet which should have come with asparagus sadly showed up with green beans. I notified my waiter who had someone promptly bring me the asparagus. Lord have mercy, the asparagus was bland and limp. The filet (although cooked well) was overly salty. The mashed potatoes were ... I suppose I can consider them warm. The green beans brought over in error were flavorful but sadly wasn't what I wanted with my dish.  Now my sisters lobster ravioli; the \"shrimp\" referenced in the menu were some teeny tiny baby shrimp. Something you'd see at an Applebee's. The 20+ baby shrimp and oddly placed sliced grape tomatoes really brought down the quality of her dish.   To end this awful dinner, our waiter who was otherwise great until this point committed the worst party foul: this fool tossed my leftovers!! I asked him to box mine and my sister stated she was done with hers and he said \"ok\". He came back with a take home desert of creme brulee for my sister but my leftovers were missing. He admittedly tossed them not knowing I wanted them boxed. He did offer to have a filet made for me to go but I was absolutely over this place. Still provided an 18-20% tip because he was decent otherwise.  Sadly, because of the quality of food I more than likely won't be visiting this establishment again.",

Even my eight year old complimented the service we received. The food was excellent! The calamari appetizer was perfectly cooked and we all enjoyed it. Our entrees were delicious and the kids had plenty of options to choose from. We sat outside on the patio since the weather was beautiful. What made it even better was sound of the adjacent waterfall. The resturant wasnt overly crowded on a Friday night which we were really surprised with, but enjoyed nonetheless. All in all a great dinner with great service and will most definitely be returning. I highly recommend this resturant for anyone who is looking for good Italian food.",

First, Rebecca was our server and was easily one of the best servers I've ever had (and I'm a server!). We went during lunch time and they weren't very busy, but right off the bat she was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. She explained their whole menu (we'd never been here before) and answered all questions. Who knows if she thought we were annoying or not because she really knows how to work for her money (good for you, Rebecca).   After we ordered our starter salads and soup, she came out with an appetizer of their margherita flatbread COMPLIMENTARY. I don't know if they just had an extra one or they messed up somewhere, but it was amazing and such a kind gesture.   I ordered a small Caesar salad (no croutons), my dad had the caprese salad and my mom the lobster bisque. ALL GOOD. The caprese was probably the least memorable, but that lobster bisque- I remember like it was yesterday (it was about a week ago), it was creamy and they weren't short handed with the lobster pieces.   Mom ordered the pasta woozie- very good with fresh spinach! Dad had the pasta bravo- perfect al dente rigatoni and the sauce was good! I had the lobster ravioli alla vodka- amazing sauce and the ravioli had just the right amount of chewiness.   We all took our pasta dishes in a box and couldn't even think about dessert because of how stuffed we were! But we'll definitely be back, and Rebecca I'm sorry, but we're asking for you :) (and I hope everyone requests you and you make a bunch of money because any server who puts on the perfect presentation like how you did, you deserve it!)",

Staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  The Mahi Mahi came with incredible vegetables. The snap pees were crisp and sweet. The Sausage Sacchetti was served with incredible sweet sausage. The essence of anise was incredible. The stuffed cheese pasta blended wonderfully with the sweet sausage and red sauce. The desserts were wonderful. The ambience was wonderful.

Service was impeccable. They were more than willing to move me seats when I asked (we were seated near the door to the patio seating & I get cold very easily). Completely professional wait staff & floor staff at all times. Our waitress, I believe her name was Rebecca (short blonde curly hair), made amazing recommendations. I had the chicken Marsala (sp?) since they didn't have chicken parm on their menu for the day. It was only $14 & honestly big enough to feed 2 people. My daughter got the kid's chicken parm, which was only $5 & as big as an adult plate. I am so baffled at the ambience, the pricing, the food quality, & the serving sizes.  This place does NOT cut any corners. I highly recommend going & I am not upset with myself for not trying this place sooner.  Thank you Bravo for this amazing lunch! You earned yourself a new repeat patron today!",

Besides the food being good, the service was just plain amazing. Our waiter Aaron was probably one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He recommended a few dishes for us, and told us the reasons why he liked them so much.   To start we ordered the Calamari, which was perfectly cooked. I hate when calamari is too soggy or when it's overly crispy, but this calamari was just right. It was paired with a spicy horseradish sauce (MUST TRY) and a marinara sauce.   I ordered the classic spaghettini and meatballs. Now, this spaghettini was different from others in the sense that it had a pomodoro and marinara sauce mixed together. That mixed with the meatballs was absolute perfection.  Bravo is definitely a must try if you're in the Henderson area. I'll be back soon to get my pasta fix.",

    "text": "My two favorite words beside bottomless brunch? HAPPY HOUR.  This place recently opened up at the Galleria Mall and I had heard it had a great happy hour, but I wouldn't believe it until I experienced.  We just happened to go on National Martini Day so they had even more drink specials than usual.  I can say with 100% certainty that their Happy Hour is UNBELIEVABLE.  Not only are their drink prices out of this world, their bar bite prices are amazing too!  We got 3 or 4 drinks each (two of us) and about 4 bar bite plates to share.  The bar bites are largely portioned so we were more than stuffed when we finally finished.  And everything we had was delicious!  I loved the flat bread I ordered and their spin on fried mozzarella was amazing too!    I am normally not a martini person, but in celebration of National Martini Day I decided to step out of my comfort zone.  The bartender sold me on one and it was amazing!  I loved the food.  I loved the drinks.  I loved the pricing.  I loved the location.  I basically loved my whole visit!  My main issue is that the service was relatively slow for how not busy they were.  For example, the manager was testing the bartenders pours.  One of the bartenders had just taken our drink order when the manager said it was his turn and he chose to test his pour rather than throw together our drinks.  I understand from an industry perspective how important it is to test pours, but if the two patrons whose order you just took are sitting right there and could visibly see you chose to take you pour test for 5 minutes before making our drinks (which would've taken the same amount of time)...that's just poor decision making my opinion.  The customer should always come first.  It would have been different if we were at a table and weren't there to see it, but we just got the vibe from our bartender that he didn't really care about servicing us and had better things to do.  There was a female bartender on staff who took amazing care of us, though, balancing out our experience!  But, this place had just opened so I'm sure they are still working out the kinks and everything will begin to run smoothly with time.",

I wish the caprese salad had thinner tomatoes but overall it was delicious, the dressing they used was sweet, but not overbearing. The calamari wasn't as crunchy as I hoped it would be but I was a big fan of their sauces on the sides. The spaghettini was so good! It was absolutely perfect. I loved how much vegetables were in it, their ingredients tasted so fresh! Our server was also very attentive and my overall experience in this place was very pleasant. Great food, great atmosphere, and awesome customer service! I'm definitely coming back to check out more of their menu and their wines. :)",

That comes in handy! The decor is very nice; very open and airy, with plenty of windows to let the natural light in. The menu is quite extensive for an Italian restaurant, with lighter fare, gluten free, and kids menus as well! The food is excellent. I chose the chicken and pesto spaghettini, as did another person in the party. The third person chose the chicken Milanese. Portions are very generous and you could easily take half home for leftovers. I split a bravo chopped salad with my friend, and we both enjoyed it. The desert menu---save room for their deserts!!--is mouthwatering. I ended up trying the warm chocolate peanut butter brownie (this is a single serving portion) that was TO DIE FOR!!  The service could use some work--there were lulls in service where we were waiting for refills on drinks and the complimentary bread. All in all I was impressed with this new establishment and I will definitely return!",

I ended up regretting that decision.   Our busboy was so friendly our waiter on the other hand was kind of a snood. He was an older gentlemen and just didn't have a good personality. We had lots of questions being that the place is new and we had never been there and seemed annoyed at every question we asked.   & the atmosphere was literally so loud I couldn't hear  my own thoughts let alone the person across from me.   Our food was average. I mean this place is not cheap. It's quite pricey actually and my food was just bland, I would think for a $20 plate of fettuccini Alfredo I would get something to talk about! Instead it left me wishing i had stuck to the usual Olive Garden. Most likely will not return.",

There is a nice patio area, bar area and main dining room. We had a booth near the open kitchen - I love watching chefs at their craft. They also have a private dining room (note taken for future family celebrations).   The herb bread was warm and quickly devoured. My partner had the Pasta Bravo (chicken rigatoni) and I had my fav - Eggplant Parmesan. The eggplant was done just to my liking - thinly sliced and lightly breaded with excellent sauce. The accompanying pasta had roasted cherry tomatoes in the sauce and was topped with snipped fresh basil.  We shared a Warm Chocolate Cake for dessert.   It was a fairly quiet weeknight, so we had fast service and a relaxing meal. The server was prompt and friendly. Definitely recommend!",

No complaints there, however, the food....NO BUENO!!   My niece fell in love with this place when she 1st tried it about 2 years ago, she came in to town to visit and she wanted to go so bad!   We made reservations online and when we got there, the place was so empty!! There were maybe around 4-5 other tables. This place used to be full on a Sunday!  We got to our table where they brought out the bread and oil to enjoy, I noticed the menu was different, fewer options. They used to have a variety of different pasta options, now they've seemed to have condensed it.   I decided on the stuffed tortellini and a side Caesar salad. When the salad came out and I tasted, I knew the food wasn't going to be right. The salad dressing was way too much which made the salad soggy and it had a strong overpowering taste. Definitely not in a good way. I only had a few bites, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.   It just got worse after that. My tortellini came out and not only was the pasta a little undercooked but it came out cold. My husband said the same thing about his spaghetti bolognese.  No one at our table was satisfied with their food.   Like I previously mentioned, our sever was wonderful! She totally rocked it!   I'll pass on the food though.",

The salad is amazing!! I could eat just that and be perfectly happy! It's so fresh and flavorful. It's by far the best salad I think I've had. Highly recommend it!! The Pasta Bravo was very good and cooked al dente like it should be. I loved the mushrooms in it.   The service was good. Not everyone got bread at the same time which they should have.

There was only 1 other table occupied, which was nice making service prompt and attentive. I order the shrimp scampi. This dish was pretty light considering it was a medium size serving of capellini (similar to angel hair pasta) and shrimp. This dish was tasty overall. Just as Charlene mentioned her review, the interior is definitely European inspired (Italian specifically) which makes it a beautiful venue. I would definitely consider this place if I had to some type of celebration dinner. Overall great experience, I will be back.",

Unfortunately, the sauces were a bit on the salty side and even after sprinkling lemon juice on top- the food still remained salty.  This isn't an end all be all- I would definitely give this place another try sometime.

They have great selections of traditional Italian dishes, appetizers, and soups. They also have a wide range of wines and cocktails. Right off the bat they bring you yummy bread and oil that has some Indian flavors. Which was odd since we were in an Italian restaurant but it was very appetizing. To start we decided on the fried calamari. Which was great! We drizzled it with lemon and enjoyed dipping the pieces in the marinara and tartar mayo sauce. We craved some of the classics so we got the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and the spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was very fresh and the right texture. The meats were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sauces where creamy and thick. I could go on and on because I am a bit passionate about pasta...well I guess carbs in general! But if I had to choose between both dishes I would choose the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. Something about the creamy, butter flavor of the sauce makes you want to savor every last bite. Also don't forget to order the mascarpone Cheesecake for dessert! It is Drizzled in sweet sauces and every bite is very decadent. Trust me you will enjoy it!",

Hugo our waiter was extremely slow and it made for a bad experience.  I don't know if he's new but he should be retrained to serve guests in a timely manner.  Greet quest as soon as they sit down not 6 minutes later.  Bring out all drinks together not one at a time.  Let guests know that certain wines are being discontinued and the menu is not up to date.  Not letting guest sit wondering why it's taken 10 minutes for their wine to arrive.  The evening isn't about the wine but customer service.  I bragged to my guest that they were going to have a great experience and sadly we didn't.  Saaudia where are you in my time of need.",

I went with eggplant parm. Two huge slices, on the thick side, which I love. However, it was undercooked. That was a bummer. I didn't care for the breading, and there was very little tomato sauce. The capellini pomodoro didn't knock my socks off, the garlic tasted off. I was disappointed because my friends plates looked amazing. Amd Yelpers love it. It could have just been an off night with a cook with an off night. I get it. Yes, I could have sent it back, but I don't like to do that. My friends would be eating, id be waiting. Then id be eating amd they'd be waiting. Awkward, uncomfortable, not happening.  I will come back and try something else and update this accordingly.",

The menu is very small and the options are simply blah. The server recommended the bolognese and that's what I went with along with lobster bisque.   The bisque was very salty and the lobster definitely had a texture of shrimp versus actual lobster. I hate wasting food so I was heavily struggling to finish it. The bolognese arrives and just looking at it I knew it wasn't going to end well. There was barely a \"sauce\" the meat was there but no sauce to even coat the noodles. It was incredibly bland.   I did not enjoy my meal here and would honestly rather eat at Macaroni Grill or even Olive Garden than to come back here again. Last time I ever listen to kids. Haha.",

I winded up ordering a grilled salmon salad and added Gorgonzola cheese it was huge salmon small but cane with loads of lettuce. Making it look soooo huge! But really just full of lettuce and not enough flavor they also put way to much tomatoes in this salad. Not worth the 15$ I payed for it. We also ordered the chicken Parmesan with angel hair pasta. Which was a huge portion as well. But this was totally worth the price as it had lots of flavor and genius portion of chicken and very tasty.  The desert was very delicious. We ordered the warm chocolate cake but is actually a chocolate molten lava cake. And it was amazing! Our service was great. She was very sweet and attentive.",

We had to find a server or bartender bc no one ever came to check up on us. Sorry, HH on a Friday? Yea, you need more staff.   The HH menu itself was good. They had about 8 drinks and about 8 appetizers. I tried their calamari which I didn't care for. They cooked it with munched garlic which overpowered everything. Their chicken and spinach pizza was the BEST!   I would definitely come back but when I do, I hope to have better service.",

    "text": "Dinner was going fine until the end. But lets start at the beginning.  I wanted pasta for dinner. I looked around for a good place to go and Bravo came across the screen. I had been there for a tasting once before and remembered the food was alright. And Bravo is close to home so they won out.  I knew walking through the door that I wanted the pasta bravo. That is chicken and mushrooms with rigatoni and tomato cream sauce. It came as advertised and was a tasty dish. The pasta was al dente as it should be. The sauce was just thick enough to stick to everything but was not too rich as cream sauces can be. The chicken was tender and nicely grilled. Mushrooms are always a bonus. It was a good dinner. The bread and seasoned oil to start my meal was also good. But then the tides turned.  My bill was brought to me quickly enough. $17.31 tax included. And it was picked up fairly quickly. But I waited a while for my change. I watched as my server took my $20 bill and a $5 bill ($25 total) to one register. Then another. Then to the bar. Then she proceeded to fulfill what looked like either a to-go beverage or a child's beverage. It had a lid. Finally she brought me my change. Two $1 bills and my $5. I guess I'm tipping $5 since $2 would be jerk move. But I felt forced into it. $3 was more appropriate. Maybe $4. But no, forced to leave a $5 (nearly 30%!). Fine, I'm feeling generous. But then I relized it was straight cash I was given in return. No coins. Where is my $0.69? Taken from me without my concent, that's where. Did I question it? I did not. That is on me. But it didn't seem worth it to wait around any longer and argue over $0.69. I just walked out with me $2 and full belly. Looking back, I should have left $2 as a tip and taken the $5.   Service was fine until that mishap. Maybe a little slow but friendly. Now I feel like I've been robbed. I can honeslty say I don't expect to be back. The food is OK here but not so good that I want to put up with incorrect change and being forced into leaving a larger tip than is necessary lest I feel like a jerk.",

    "text": "I was expecting more and was disappointed. Came here for a large group for a birthday party. The place was very spacious with a beautiful patio seating area. Our servers were Saydie and Dray. Sorry if I killed their names. We had a group of 15 kids and 10 adults. Our servers were great and very attentive. Saydie was very funny and went with our table's humor. My 3 stars goes to the food, not the service or ambiance.    When I glanced at the menu, so many things looked delicious to me and I honestly had a hard time deciding what to order. I ended up getting the grilled salmon which was my server's favorite dish. So it had to be a sure thing. I was excited. When our food arrived, only half the table got their food while the other half had to wait an additional 5-10 minutes until their food arrived. I think this was due to the servers putting in food at different times. Needless to say, the timing was off.   My dish looked beautiful and I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, my dish was bland.  What killed it at first bite was my \"roasted\" sweet potatoes were still raw.  I tried to suck it up and eat it but it wasn't good.  So I politely asked the server for another order of the sweet potatoes. My salmon was not your typical salmon color, it was actually white which I thought was odd. Made me question if it was really salmon? All in all, there was no wow factor in this dish and the worst is when food is bland. I only took a few bites and took the rest home.  My new order of sweet potatoes came out fresh and hot and was way better.  I think they cooked it with coconut oil too because it had a little sweet after taste which was delicious.  I'm open to come back and try this spot again if someone invited me but I personally wouldn't choose to come here again. The prices are high and for what you're getting, I would rather go to Brio's where the food is amazing and consistent. Funny enough, we were actually at Brio's the night before and everything we got was on point. Sorry Bravo.",

When my dish has touch the bottom of the another plate? Does she know hygiene?I wonder if she is even trained to do this job. She does not really want to do her job here.  She tries to  cut corners in her job. On a separate occasion when I came here, I asked to get some fresh grated cheese and she gave me take out dried cheese. She claims it is the same cheese. We eat here often, we know our food. She is lazy and unwilling to help. To avoid having an unpleasant time here, where you have to spend time arguing with your server on simple requests, do not sit in Saadia's section. She will make you sad like her name.  Servers at the restaurant no longer have name tags on their uniform. However, she can be distinguished by her heavily braided hair, black complexion and attitude.",

    "text": "My and my husband have been very curious about this place for a while now so we said let's go why not! When we walked in we were greeted very kindly by the host and sat as us at our table and said enjoy your lunch with a great smile. Everything was going great until we got our Waitress her name was Gisela B. Very cold unfriendly lady with no smile or customer service personality. Me and my husband felt very pressured and uncomfortable from then on. Anytime I told her I had a question I just felt very pressured and nervous to ask anything about the menu items because again it's my first time there so I don't know how this place works and how their food is made and what the extra items that come with the entree. We ordered the pepperoni cheese dip which was amazing! Then we ordered our lunch combo which was the lobster bisque which again was AMAZING! I got the balsamic chicken and my husband had the lasagna. Our waitress never came around our table to ask if we were doing ok and she never asked if we needed anything else or refills on our drinks. When we were finished with our food and needed boxes we waited and waited sitting there looking around like okayyyyy. Well this very very nice and polite gentlemen named Devonte if I remember correctly noticed us and came to our table and asked if there was something he can help us with and he offered to take our plates and box them up for us with a great attitude and a smile. So to sum this all up the food was amazing but our service was very very horrible and uncomfortable. What made us feel good was how this young gentleman came and helped us out. Needless to say we usually tip very well so even tho he was not our waiter he still got a little something for helping us out. I hope next time we go because we didn enjoy the food we get another waitress because she made the experience not worth while.",

Pair that with $5 glasses of wine and you have a winning combination.  The restaurant itself is nicely appointed and very clean.  We had exceptional service from the hostess, bartender and wait staff...all very friendly!  If you are looking for reasonable prices and delicious happy hour food, near the Galleria Mall, give Bravo Cucina a try.",

Started off with the bread being hard & not fresh. All the time for happy hour it was fresh & hot. Ordered calamari & spinach dip for apps. Spincah dip itself was good but the flatbread that it comes with was hard & not soft. Calamari was absolutely horrible. No taste in the batter & it was rubbery. Had calamari the day before @ Claim Jumper & it was amazing. Ordered the shrimp scampi for my main. So much red chili flake in it it burned my lips off. When it wasn't burning could tell there was no seasoning to it what-so-ever. Certainly no salt in the pasta water. Dinner mate ordered a medium rare steak & it came super rare. Waiting for waitress to come back so we could send it back took forever so finally got up & flagged down someone else. Rest of party was almost done eating by the time it came back cooked to medium. I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was the highlight of the night. IMO the only good item I had all night. Just all around bad experience. Like I said was really disappointed as I have been there several time for happy hour & they have all been pretty good.",

Service wise it was one of the best experiences we've had in the valley! The food was quite delicious- I ordered the pick two lunch combo of shrimp and orzo- highly recommended!

I never asked for a refill because he was right there with a new one. I had the eggplant Parmesan and it was a 1000 times better than Brio. I love eggplant and stopped getting it at brio because the quality of food has seriously gone downhill there. The only complaint I had was that the food could have been hotter. But I saw it come out of the window and tight on to the tray and to our table so I know it wasn't the server. I've waited tables for awhile and notice EVERYTHING. I actually can't wait to return and have the yummy cheesecake Ernesto suggested. This is the best food and service I've had in a WHILE.",

Then I had the mushroom ravioli and it was soooo good. The grape tomatoes on top tasted very fresh, the mushrooms were soft and light and the cream sauce was perfect. My husband had the sausage sacchiti (pasta purses filled with cheese) and he was very happy with it. We also got the seasonal dessert - lemon blueberry tart in creme angelise-  it was also very delicious- get it!   Our server (Brian) had to be the friendliest server I've ever had. He very much reminded us of Jerry from parks and recreation. Always smiling, made great recommendations, helpful around our baby, he even brought a tablecloth to cover the stroller when we asked!   Highly recommend!",

Third course a tiramisu for two was great way to finish the meal.  The special course meal for 3 courses only cost $20 great price and great meal.  Definitely would recommend this location and restaurant. The manager was engaged greeting everyone at their table to ensure everything was wonderful. Great impression!!!",

    "text": "First I want to say, the food tasted amazing. Both me and my husband agree that the food is really good.   We placed an order thru GrubHub. When our order came it was missing the chopped salad and the lobster bisque.  I ordered gluten free- Bravo Pasta and my husband ordered lasagna.  When I looked at my pasta dish I was concerned it did not look gluten free. I have been eating gluten free for years and I can often tell if pasta looks gluten free or not. So I decided to call and report our missing items and ask if they actually made my pasta gluten free.   What was great is that they sent us out our missing items and I was pleased that they were willing to make things right.   The reason for the 2 stars is that when I called to ask if the pasta I received was gluten free, I was assured on the phone that it was. When the second part of the order came, it also had their actual gluten free pasta in it and it was not the same as the first pasta I received. Had they just told me that they made a mistake on the phone I would have gladly waited but because I was reassured on the phone that the pasta I already had was gluten free, I ate it.  Sadly, now I am sick. I have celiac so it is no \"lifestyle\" choice. I count on being told the truth. I realize there are risks eating out but this I feel was beyond the norm of nondisclosure.   I would eat here again but I would not order their food from GrubHub as I feel they do not read those orders in detail for some reason.  **** I would like to amend my review. They have gone into grub hub and relabeled their gluten free items so they can see the dishes ordered are gluten free. We have ordered from them since and we will again. The food is delish!",

Bravo is mid range regarding price but has some great chicken and pasta dishes.  The bread is absolutely incredible and I would come just for that. No draft beers is a bummer but they have a decent selection of great tasting bottled beers.    Overall, Bravo is a great restaurant.  All of the staff has always been friendly and I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Italian food at reasonable prices. I had the lobster ravioli, while my wife had spaghetti and meatballs. First, the positives:  1) The busser/drink taker/food runner (sorry I didn't get her name) was awesome. This review would have gone south very quickly without her extraordinary effort to supplement our server. 2) Everything about our meal was good while not impressive. From the pre-meal bread and oil, the meals themselves, and the portion size of said entrees. 3) Really liked the decor/ambiance of the restaurant/bar, definitely do not feel you are at a mall.  Negatives: 1) Waiter was almost non-existent. By the time he got around to us, we'd already received our drinks and placed our food order. However he was nice enough to re-fill my wife's drink and bring us the check. 2) While the restaurant wasn't full (Saturday lunch), it did have 2 larger parties that seemed to throw it off just prior to our arrival, causing a longer than needed wait for our food to arrive (by the looks of it, they had plenty of staff).  Overall, I will give it another shot if over in the area.",

However I have to agree with fellow Elite Chris V., DO NOT get the pasta Bravo. It's just unimpressive and nothing special.  The Alfredo sauce is good. The house salad with the creamy Parmesan dressing, super yummy. Honestly all of the salads are great. The steak is a solid choice but again simply mediocre versus wonderful. Nothing is bad, but the only thing that makes me love coming back is the dam cheesecake. A huge slice with a creme bruleed crust, worth the average food, every single time.  And the service is outstanding. Even when they are slammed busy, or I order take out, they seem to be on point no matter what. I have also had a couple cocktails. This place would be great for salads, appetizers, and a bottle of wine. Truly between 3 and 4 stars, but considering there is nothing WRONG or BAD, I will go with the 4. I am just a picky Italian girl with high end taste. This place will get the job done.",

    "text": "It was our first time eating here and I'm sorry to say but I would only give it 3 stars only because when me and my gf walked in I expected to be greeted as soon as the host made eye contact.  Unfortunately that didnt happen! There was 2 female hosts tonight which was a WFA and a BFA, both looked young.  When we walked in, they both looked at us, caught eye contact and I felt there was a moment of judgement which felt like it lasted for about 15 seconds because all they did was look at us and didnt say anything.  After those seconds, the WFA finally said hello and we said hi and for two.  The WFA looked at the BFA and they were whispering and looking a screen then looked back toward the tables, then looked back at the screen, then finally the BFA walked behind the wooden partition directly behind the host desk and just stared at us while getting the table settings and as if she was telling us to follow without saying anything! So we moved closer and walked to the first table and she stood there while we sat and I said thank you and she really didnt say anything. I really thought she was mute but I was pretty sure she was talking to the other host, this is why I've decided only 3 stars.  Her posture was weak, she walked others to their table as if she didnt want to be there and the way she swayed her arms makes it obvious that she needs more training for customer service.  Then while sitting at the table, we waited for a while until finally I believe it was the shift supervisor or manager came up to us and asked if we've been helped and we both said no.  She was wearing I think was a grey sweater and glasses. She was awesome and the other supervisor which she was wearing a red top was awesome as well! The best service came from our server, unfortunately we dont know her name but I assume she was Hispanic with braces and black hair.  The 3 of them what made us stay and made us enjoy our food which I must say was delicious! I would give 5 stars to the 3 ladies that served us and checked if we have been helped together with the taste of the food which the props go to the chefs!",

    "text": "Wow!  We didn't know where to eat tonight, and decided to check out the newer restaurants at the mall.  We decided to have Italian and tried Bravo.  We ere seated immediately and our server came straight to the table.  Our drinks arrived very quickly.  We placed our entree orders and opted to add salad/soup.  Our server commended us for our choices.  The focaccia with olive oil was delicious!  While we were enjoying our bread, another server brought over a Margarita Flatbread, on the house for first-time diners.  My husband enjoyed his Lobster Bisque and my Caprese Salad was delicious!  For entrees, we enjoyed Mama's Lasagna Bolognese and Spicy Scallop Marinara.  The entrees were hot and huge!  We could only eat half, but they were simply delicious.  We enjoyed the fresh grated Parmesan.    We will definitely come back.  Great service, delicious food and good prices.  You are getting quality for the price, and the price is right",

    "text": "I was excited when I saw Bravo was opening near my house because Bravo was my favorite restaurant when I was in college. I just had to give it a try to see if I still liked it as much as I did back then. We stopped in for lunch last weekend. I can tell that they are making a serious effort with service as a new location. I hope that they keep it up because the service was great and very attentive.   The herbed bread with seasoned dipping oil was as good as I remember it being. I just wish they provided a little more oil because the tiny dish comes out with barely any oil on it.   I remember that they always had good salads so I started with the insalata della casa. This salad has bacon, crispy pasta, and a parmesan dressing in addition to the vegetables. The salad was even better than I remember. My husband hates all vegetables and he was disappointed that he had passed on salad.  For lunch I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka sauce and my husband ordered the sausage sacchetti with tomato sauce. The ravioli was good with plenty of flavor and even tiny pieces of shrimp on top. The portion was perfect for me, just enough food without being over the top. I liked my husband's dish more though. The sauce on the sacchetti was bolder than my vodka sauce and I loved it.  I would say Bravo is leaps and bounds above an Olive Garden and closer to a Maggiano's quality. Awesome food and service at very reasonable prices. We'll add this to our list of regular restaurants to visit.",

    "text": "This will probably be our last time visiting BRAVO!. I've eaten here a handful of times over the course of a year or so and each time it's become increasingly disappointing. Today's visit may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It being Father's Day, I decided to give the restaurant another chance since my dad is a fan of the place. Surprisingly, it wasn't terribly busy. The hostess sat us immediately in a booth by the kitchen. We were greeted promptly, however...our waitress failed to build any sort of rapport with us throughout the entire meal, giving off a \"strictly business\" vibe. I refuse to give her name because, being a server myself, I don't rat out other servers. We were given drinks and table bread. Now, for their bread, I've ALWAYS been disappointed by their bread. It's a sad, lukewarm row of bland, (sometimes stale) pull-apart breadsticks. I've never been impressed with it tasting like it came out of Wal-Mart's bakery, so I knew what I was getting into. The waitress then recommended the Crispy Shrimp Napoli as an appetizer. It was quite tasty, although not remotely worth its $12.99 price tag for the amount received. I always order the Inslata Della Casa as it's (usually) one of the best salads I've ever had...and although it was still the same great salad, it was significantly smaller and they COVERED it with parmesan cheese which essentially caused every other bite to taste like I was eating a gym sock... I decided on my go-to, the Pasta Bravo...but I noticed the ingredients changed since I ordered it last. I decided to take a gamble and get the revised one anyway. My father decided on the Chicken Marsala and my significant other ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo. He asked the waitress if he could add some ricotta on top of his pasta and she told him no because they don't carry it...when the last three times we've been there, they've added ricotta. Maybe they no longer carry it...but what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't carry ricotta cheese??  The next problem was that the entrees themselves took almost thirty minutes to come out. I'm in no way impatient in restaurants whatsoever and judging from not-terribly-busy dining room, yet the odd panicky scrambling of the line staff and cooks, I came to the conclusion that they were somewhat understaffed. When the food DID finally come out, we were offered grated cheese to which we all said \"yes.\" My father seemed to enjoy his meal, which was awesome. My pasta was absolutely bland. It needed something...some kind of seasoning. It was NOTHING to rave about. My S.O. found his pasta to be the exactly the same and on top of that, he watched his food sit in the window about five minutes ahead of my father's and mine, so his was lukewarm-to-cold by the time it reached the table. Both of us sort of forced down about half, after which combining it in one to-go box. My dad seemed pleased with his meal, so that's good at least. The waitress came and went, but very:  \"Anyone need anything else?\" \"Uh...no, I think we're go-\" *walks away*  My father then orders a few additional sides to take home with him that takes an additional twenty minutes (it's mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) and my S.O. wanted another Diet Coke that he never recieved. The waitress returns with the dessert menu and to my absolute disbelief they REMOVED the cannoli dip from their menu. I was shocked... In my opinion, that incredible dessert was one of the things that MADE this restaurant. I about had it at this point... We all split a tiramisu that tasted like it was out of a box COVERED with cocoa powder causing me to do a \"Cinnamon Challenge\" a few times. After all is said and done...a whopping $111 for three beverages, one appetizer, three entrees, and one dessert. NOT worth it.  Such a shame where BRAVO! is headed. I absolutely LOVED this place when I first visited it. Now...I'm not sure if I'll ever be returning. BEAUTIFUL atmosphere...but when it's countered with rising prices, falling quality, and mediocre service...it puts in perspective just how many other authentic Italian restaurants are out there just begging for the trying.  BRAVO!? More like BRAV-NO.",

I love the spacious, comfortable and spotless inside. I'd never been there but my husband described it as the \"cheaper\" cousin of Brio. I still thought it was very nice inside.   The service was quick and friendly. We had less than an hour to make a movie across the street and the server was great. Drinks and food came quickly, glasses were always full, and we didn't have to wait any time at all for our check.   The food was very good! I tried the Pasta Bravo, their signature dish. I really liked the roasted red pepper cream sauce. The chicken was a little dry but, overall the dish was enjoyable. My husband liked his filet a lot, and it was cooked just as he asked.   They do have an app with a rewards program. Supposedly you get a birthday coupon, which I was celebrating, but I had just signed up when we got there, so we didn't get a coupon.   I will definitely consider coming back here with others to dine out nearby!",

I hosted a small dinner in their private room  at no extra cost which was the perfect venue for a larger party- beautiful, clean and intimate. The staff was nothing less than Amazing! Lesha was very kind and knowledgable when it came to all the items on the menu and the other server assisting her (I hate that I 4got his name) but he was so good with my kids n very helpful. Managers Ashley n Moira were super accommodating, I was highly impressed  ...now on to the food lol I'm extremely BIG on Food (because I cook extremely well myself) so here's my honest oppinion; I choose to have only the Summer Nights Menu to be presented to my guest because it was the most cost effective option, 3course meal for 20 bucks!  You really can't beat it. I was very apprehensive at first, after I found out this place was a food chain but I was pleasantly surprised, I had the Lobster Bisque and i loved that it was a little spicy and very flavorful n hearty a tad bit on the salty side tho but was still very good. The Chicken w/goat cheese was delicious and very tasty, The Salmon with the crispy vegetable hash was yummy too, the Berry Bread pudding was my favorite it wasn't too Sweet n I love that in a dessert, it makes u want to eat more of it.  They allowed my to bring in our own store bought cake  which was nice of them and they allowed me to decorate in advance which was convenient. Im all about \"celebrating on a budget\" i have a large family n it can get extremely expensive to go out to eat- but before I spend my whole paycheck on Generic places like Red Lobster(yuck!), i like to look for places who have better quality food for a more reasonable, family friendly price- and BRAVO in Henderson  is one of them! The overall food and service was outstanding. I will definitely be hosting more events here. Thanks again for an Awsome Experience! BRAVO! LOL",

I was hesitant to try this place but decided to give it a shot since I had to go to the mall anyways (this place is right outside of the Galleria Mall). Oh man was I glad I did because the food here is freaking fantastic. They bring bread to the table right when you arrive and it's so good. It had rosemary in it and comes with an olive oil mix to dip. For my entree, I went with the grilled salmon and it was cooked to perfection. What I love about this place too is that they note on the menu what items are under 600 calories, which allows me to eat guilt free!   I've been here a few times since and I honestly have never ordered anything I didn't like. I've tried a handful of their sandwiches, pasta, and dessert and I loved everything. I also recommend the sangria and the peach bellini if you're feeling a refreshing fruity drink. They have a happy hour Yelp check in offer here too so make sure all you Yelpers check in!",

Food: I ordered the Roman salad which had Parmesan style fried chicken breast on top-the chicken was moist, tasty and came with two generous portions. Also on the salad was bacon, hard-boiled egg and freshly made ranch. Complimentary bread is soft and served with a tasty garlic oil that tastes like pizza, if you can imagine. My husband ordered the beef ravioli which he enjoyed.  Service: Jeraldine was so attentive, personable (we had such a pleasant conversation with her during dinner) and helpful. She went above and beyond honoring a yelp deal coupon, even though it was outside of the hours it's offered (sausage and ricotta stuffed banana peppers topped with mozzarella and tomato sauce-spicy but so tasty!). And even though my salad came back with dressing tossed in when I ordered it on the side, she apologized and quickly had a fresh one remade and brought out.",

First, the bread that is served is rosemary bread.  In fact, there's so much rosemary that it is all you can taste.  It's overpowering and it makes you wonder if the bread could stand on its own without it.  Cut the rosemary by 2/3 and you might have a decent bread.  Then the other big thing is - I have tried several entrees and their red sauce isn't like anything I've ever had.  I don't know what they use, but it's terrible.  This is probably the worst red pasta sauce I've ever eaten; every red dish has it and it's terrible.  I have no idea how it's made, but please stop doing it.  Go to other fine Italian restaurants and order dishes with their red sauce, then make yours close to that and you might have a winner.  This one is just awful.  So now the menu is limited to no bread and items that aren't made with red sauce.  Also, at most Italian restaurants (and I'm not talking Olive Garden, that wannabe place) salads and/or soup come with entrees; this place does not.  Everything is a la carte, and the prices aren't cheap.  For now I'll stick with Italian restaurants that really know how to do it right.",

    "text": "I looove pasta, and since my boyfriend and I are always looking for new Henderson restaurants to try, we decided to give this place a whirl. It was alright, but I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.   Service was fast - we were in and out in about 45 minutes, so this restaurant is good if you are in a bit of a hurry but want something better than the food court. I think our waitress may have been coming off a double shift or something, though, because she was \"neutral\" in the friendliness department, and kind of out of it.   We ordered two of the special, which was supposed to be soup and pasta. $1 extra for lobster bisque. We ordered 1 lobster bisque (special) and 1 Italian wedding soup (special). When the bill arrived, we realized we had been charged for two lobster bisques instead. I pointed this out to the waitress, who then spent a solid 3 minutes arguing with me that the bill was correct. In the meantime, I told her, \"well, it's only a dollar, but I'd hate for it to come out of your tip instead,\" because I wasn't planning on paying that extra dollar (I'm not necessarily cheap, but I don't like to be ripped off). It felt incredibly silly arguing about that one dollar.  AND she forgot my wine until we were almost done with our meals! I would rather have just had it taken off.   The food was OK, not spectacular, and not terrible, either. There was a really cute fireplace outside though, so maybe when the weather is nice it would be lovely to come for some cocktails and snacks outside.",

I realize the restaurant has only been open a couple of weeks but she didn't seem to be trained very well. She was not familiar with the happy hour and had to go to the bar and ask.   The Rosemary bread was good, but very little olive oil was brought out and there was none on the table. We also had to send an order back as it was hard as a rock. I ordered the house pasta, the pasta Bravo and the house salad. The salad was ok, nothing great. It could have used fresh grated cheese. The pasta dish was average as well. The sauce was good, but the pasta itself had no taste, like the pasta water had not been salted.   For dessert we ordered the warm chocolate cake and it was the best part of the meal. A warm lava cake with vanilla gelato, very rich and gooey :)  I wish the rest of the food had been that good. I may give it one more chance after a few more more weeks but not impressed with the first visit.",

It came to the table totally overcooked, hard, and unseasoned.  We told the server and he did have the kitchen remake the calamari. Second round was better but nothing to be impressed by.  The Caesar salad was the best part of the meal. Salad was fresh and dressing was plentiful and tasty. Next the main courses...between the four of us we had a Margherita pizza, Chicken Scallopini, Chicken Marsala, and Chicken parmigiana.  Pizza was tasteless, chicken scallopini looked like a half portion and pasta was hard and not cooked enough, chicken parmigiana was ok but quality of Olive Garden, chicken Marsala sauce was loaded with salt--surprised my daughter doesn't have canker sores in her mouth and the green beans were hard enough to use as a boomerang. Then we had to ask for a dessert for my husband for his birthday! I would think it would've been recognized since it was listed on the reso! Overall, the entire party was disappointed and will not return for a 2nd bad experience! Not impressed and prices aren't warranted compared to food quality. Mediocre at best...GO TO BRIO, instead...",

For apps I would recommend the Spinach and Artichoke dip or the crispy calamari. For dinner, the eggplant Parmesan, chicken scallopini, Gorgonzola crusted filet, mushroom ravioli, and lasagna are all so good. The warm chocolate cake, with a molten lava center, and gelato vanilla bean ice cream is the best. Try this place out. It is sister restaurants with Brio but its BETTER!",

The chicken was sooo moist & bursting with flavor & the vegetables were grilled to perfection, not overly inundated with excessive oil or butter, which is challenging to find in restaurants now a days, since my husband & I are very health conscious individuals. Our waters & coffee were never empty & Brian checked on us several times to make sure we were content with everything.

Just didn't expect sauce in my eggs. Anyway salmon salad is great. Italian dishes are wonderful too. Next trying sandwhiches. They look good in the pictures. Fast service. Polite waiters. Bend over backwards for you. I eat at the bar if I only have a short lunch. I cant get that quality at fast food for 5.00. Thats only at the bar though. Id like to sit at Bravos one day all day.
