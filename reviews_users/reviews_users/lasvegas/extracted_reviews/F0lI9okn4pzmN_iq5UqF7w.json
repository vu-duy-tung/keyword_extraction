The place got busy a few minutes after we came in and Anik, the general manager, was under control and efficient. I will definitely be coming back.",

My husband, who isn't much of a pizza person, really enjoyed his veggie pizza. My two kids split a pepperoni pizza and were actually quiet since they were eating and enjoying the food. While I agree that they can skimp on the toppings, they've always put on extra without hassle when I ask for more.",

You almost feel like you are in Subway when you enter, but the quality is far better than Subway.    Not a place I will frequent, but no real complaints either.

All four pizzas were baked to perfection, unlike some in the pictures above.  The prepackaged salads at the cash register looked tasty, and I might pick one up for lunch next time.

So I proceed to order because who knows it may be the Business! Well not right.  The pizza dough lacked any pizza dough quality.  The meatballs I had were mushy and salty.  Onions, bell pepper , olives all cut in an uneven manner it looks like very little care goes into that department.  The meats look pre frozen and they taste it. The dough is disappointing and it totally refutes the purpose of getting a pizza baked from the fire.  If you are from the east or a pizza fanatic that has preferences and understands that the resistance in the dough which makes it pizza and makes it memorable than steer clear from here.  I will not be coming back especially because the concept is a rip off of Chipotles. It is totally a pizza chipotle but without the quality chipotle gives you.",

The concept is: you start off with a 12\" gluten free dough, you then choose your unlimited amounts of toppings. You start with the amazing sauces.  Choices are marinara, olive oil, garlic pesto and I might have forgotten one.  Next is your choices of cheese.  You get to choose from gorgonzola, ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan and I think I might have missed one. Next is the vegetables, way too many to list.  Last but not least is the abundance of meat toppings.  Did I say unlimited yet!!!   Pizza goes into a hot pizza oven and cooks for 4-5 minutes.  Pizza is then delivered to your table.  You get all this for $7.99.  I don't think this price will stay this way for long, so hurry up and get your pizza now!!",

You can choose any and all 3 sauces, 4 cheeses, 6 meats, 11 toppings and 8 flavor blasts for endless combinations of delicious pizza.   I may also add that your pizza creation, however you make it, is ONLY $7.95 ... WHAT?!  Now, my review is only words. I would suggest you come and try this place out. If you love pizza, you will love this place. The high ceiling, bright lights and vibrant atmosphere is ideal for any situation.   I will definitely be back.",

So, if you've never been to Pieology, it's a build-your-own pizza place. I'd compare it to chipotle, except I hate chipotle and this place is amazing. But anyways, it's $7.95 per pizza. You can add as many toppings as you want. The price doesn't change. And the flavor of the pizza is fantastic.   GO TRY IT ! :)",

    "text": "There was a joint up the road from my office called \"Custom Built Pizza\" that closed down recently.  It was one of my fave lunch spots and I have been in a state of depression for months.  Until now.  Pieology!    This place has really, really ridiculously good pizza that you can custom make however you like.  Add as much of whatever toppings, cheese, veggies, etc.   The crust is thin and crispy and they are ready to eat in about 5 minutes.     I love the food - no issues whatsoever with the grub. It's good, darn good.  I have two very minor complaints.  The first complaint is outside of their control.  The parking sucks.  The lot directly north of the restaurant is always full at lunch and dinner time.  The next closest lot requires walking across the busy road that leads into Downtown Summerlin.  It's not a deal breaker but you will have to dodge a few cars.   Second, the restaurant is noisy and I don't mean just a little bit.  Every surface in the place is hard and industrial and sounds just bounces around.  Being there for lunch can induce a migraine.  They need to install some sound absorbing panels to quiet the place down.    Other than those minor quibbles, this place is well worth a visit.   I've been 4 times since it opened.  Good pizza never gets old, and Pieology has good pizza.",

    "text": "Another bookmark checked off! I have always wanted to check out Pieology not only cause it has a strong rating on yelp but also fan of building your own pizza. Use to be place that really enjoy that recently closed down few months ago close too my house. Same concept. So when I heard about this new place one that apparently started in CA and reading the reviews got me excited about pizza again. Not that my normal favorite spots are broke but always refreshing when you can come up with your own idea for pizza and taste it first hand. At Pieology Pizzeria they have a very good selection of toppings straight across the board from cheeses, meats, vegetables, and too many for me mention by name. Choices for sauces again nice selection.  Nothing really exotic over the top high end toppings just in case looking make fine dining pie. Simple pizza with three of less toppings is rule live by with my pizza but more so since all the pizza here are thin crust style. The amount of toppings I had felt like they put good amount on my pie although less/simple not exactly your two handfuls of toppings. Too each his own....  I came up with artichoke, pepperoni, sausage, and jalapeno. Red sauce as the base. I was thinking meat lovers with kick (jalapeno) and twist (artichoke). I liked it! Really no limits with the idea one can come up with at Pieology. Or you can always go with your classics or they have some pizza that can choose from off the menu. NO fun in that just go with your imagination.  The service felt was wonderful. Two different people as they were making my pie awesome. No rushing me. First timer so was explaining everything to me clearly and fun talk too.   The restaurant is find your own seat. I like the open air feeling of the place and some of the black and white photos as art decor on one wall. The wall with all the Quotes!!!! I LOVED THAT IDEA!!! It located in new downtown summerlin mall. So easy access right off the 215.",

    "text": "This Pizza place is a new addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. They offer indoor and patio seating. The concept is a pizza with unlimited toppings for one price The pizza order is processed by four people operating as a progressive line. The first person is prepping the doe which is formed by machine. The next person applies the choice of sauce and cheese. A third person add the choices of vegetables and meats. The last person collects the payment and provides a cup for your choice of self serve refreshments. Cooking time is five minutes and the finished pie is delivered to your table. A very efficient operation.   We were in line at lunch time and 15 people were ahead of me and when I reached the cash register the line behind was the same length. The wait time was longer than the pizza build and cook time.  This week day the place was filled with teens and  families. The eating area was very loud and conversation challenged.   We ordered two types of pizzas and both were delicious. The pie had a crispy thin crust and the toppings were tasty.  Pieology works a s nice place to stop after the theater or shopping for some very good pizza at an inexpensive price point.",

    "text": "I'm going to be honest there is something very off putting about going into a Pieology and seeing how it is literally a copy of the Chipotle design in every single possible way. The layout is identical, the business model is identical, even the logo looks the same. And it is not owned by the Chipotle people so that makes it even weirder. Have you ever gone into a windows store and been annoyed at how it was literally an apple store? Me too and this is the same.  Im going to go out and say it. Chipotle is terrible and I think we all know that. It will always be C level fast mexican food and that has a function I understand that. Yes it also has Vegan options so some love that but no one is going to say that Chipotle is mind blowingly good.   Pieology is pretty much exactly the same. Custom pizzas made in an assembly line and baked while you sit and wait. The pizzas are simply okay. It would be hard to say they are particularly good or bad pizzas because they are just average thin crust pizzas. You can get better pizzas at regular pizza chains I think that is pretty obvious. This place tries to give you innovative pizza options but ultimately thats more of a pathway to disaster than it is success. Some strange combinations can and will get created here.  I dont have any specific items to review because basically you just construct whatever pizza you want. The premise is a good one, but it's also one with limitations. The food can never be amazing if you get to construct it because you just have no idea what makes a good pizza a great pizza.  Perhaps I am too hard on this place because it's not trying to make amazing pizza just quick fun pizza. And I get that and to that end it is a success I guess. Is it better than Chipotle? Obviously. Do not tell me how can you compare mexican and pizza because thats not my point.   But the ultimate question concerning a pizza place is this: is the pizza restaurant good enough to justify getting in your car, driving to the restaurant, constructing your pizza in line, waiting for it, eating it at a table, and then driving home? You have a plethora of pizza delivery options at your disposal so the above question needs to be answered a yes to justify a visit. The answer is obviously no. The pizza has to be incredible to justify that amount of time and effort. It is not incredible by any means.   If you are walking through the boring part of downtown summerlin and feel like pizza okay then go ahead and eat it. Otherwise? Skip!",

So, I called them up and asked for compensation and their first suggestion was to add BBQ sauce to the pizza that was already cold.... like one do you not have food warmers/heat lamps, and two you aren't even trying to compensate us. Then, they told us to bring back the old pizza for a new one. Never had an establishment want the food they fucked up on just to throw it away but okay. Oh, and the workers excuse was it was a lot of first kids' jobs. Okay... so check to see if a pizza is completed right or hire competent enough people to add sauce. I'll definitely just go to CPK next time, they can get orders right and they actually have crust lol.",

The crust is perfectly crisp and thin, with a nice crunch with each bite.  This is like the subway of pizza...you go down the line and pick your items. For $8 you can put ANY TOPPING on your pizza and as much of it as you want!  The service is amazingly fast, with the pizza coming out in less than 10 minutes. I mean really, where can you find such an offer?!  I opted for two sauces on mine, herb butter first and then alfredo on top.  But really, you can split the pizza in half and have two totally different sauces....the options are limitless.  I can't remember the exact combo of all the veggies and meats I put on there, since I got a little greedy and picked almost everything.  Like other reviews, yes they are a little skimpy with the ingredients at first, but I just asked them to put more of whatever I wanted.  They were happy to oblige, without any complaints.  The only one minor issue I had was with the sausage.  I like Italian sausage with a little pepper/heat, but the sausage here seems a little bland.  I honestly can't wait to come back, thin crust pizza is my favorite and now I can have it my way every time, without paying extra for each additional topping!",

The BBQ chicken pizza is pretty legit, and I don't even like BBQ sauce. For a chain place, the crust is actually good! You can't customize salads at this location (lame).  The pre-made salads are not great. For the price and the quality, this place is a great deal.  Bottom line: if you like customizing things and you like pizza, come here.  If someone you're with doesn't like pizza, send them next door to Five Guys.  But seriously, who doesn't like pizza? That person is a monster - unfriend them.",

We shared 2 pizzas amongst the 3 of us and it was perfect. you don't get that heavy feeling in your stomach like with usual pizzas that have thicker crusts.

Well we just wanted a snack, so we went pretty safe and got a Classic Margherita Pizza and added ham. It was just okay, nothing special. We went with house made crust, it's a pretty thin, crackery crust. We purposely picked this place because they had outside seating and we had our dog with us, so that was a plus on their part. The establishment was busy and clean. Staff was friendly.  Not sure if I'd go back, there are a lot of pizza places like this in town, some are still around, some have folded.

    "text": "When we moved away from Irvine, CA. I knew that Pieology was going to be one those restaurants that would be hardest to let go. Come to think about it, on my last trip back to CA, we made a special trip to Pieology (Irvine Spectrum location) just so that we can \"kustom\"-ise our own personal, magical, thin crust pizza.  When I found out that they were planning on opening a location that is literally less than 10 minutes from where I currently live, I was ecstatic! Now, mind you, they are a franchise and the consistency at this Vegas location is definitely lacking. First impressions: the space is a little larger than the Irvine, CA location, but the line moves at a snails pace! I was wondering what the hold-up is; I supposed the winning, efficient staff from CA weren't transferred over as well.  $7.95 for  a nicely sized thin-crust pizza with \"unlimited\" toppings is ideal. However, I was totally turned off when we got to the front of the line, the staff was meek, bored, scared and awfully stingy with the toppings - it was nearly a joke how much they actually coughed onto our pizza; a dot here and there of basil, a dot of ricotta, tiny teaspoon of garlic, 4 pepperonis... What in the world?! They absolutely skimp at this location. On the other hand, the Pieology in CA (the one that stole my heart) really, really hooked it up - they had no shame in their sexy topping game.  Here's the trick - in order to actually enjoy the wonderful thin crust pizzas here, I would recommend that you be firm and speak up if you want extra topping, they will look hesitant, but the amount they initially put on is such comedy. I will admit, the thin crust freshly prepared and baked crust is super legit. You really have to love thin crust in order to love this place. Also the subway style ordering is a nice touch, only when they aren't trying to be cheap with the toppings.    On a scale of 1-10, ehhh, that's a tough call. It's different. Some people don't even call this pizza; they are offended by the idea. But we like it! It doesn't make us feel super food-coma'd afterwards and we always pressure them to give us more topping when they skimp. So that helps.  SUPER PRO TIP: the ranch is free and the pizza is dunkable.",

    "text": "$7.95 custom pizza with unlimited toppings? I'm in! My Cali friends rave about this place and I was pretty stoked when I found out it was coming to Vegas. Pieology is basically the Subway or Chipotle for pizza and you get to eat it 4 minutes after you make it!  The place offers a fast, fun, creative dining experience. Pick you crust (gluten free is an extra charge), pick your sauce, pick your cheese, pick your toppings, and then your meat! We usually go for the custom pizza versus the Pieology creations. The few times we had the Pieology creations, they were just OK. Pieology has nothing on CPK's version of a BBQ chicken pizza.    You have to like thin crust pizzas to eat here. Fortunately, our crust has never been burnt! Kudos to the staff for doing their job. Staff could use a little bit more training in the customer service department. They seriously never smile or seem very welcoming.   Honestly, this is not the best pizza out there. We are big fans of Grimaldi's. Usually, 1 pizza is good for me and my husband, but we always order 2 so we don't get bored of one. They have half sized pizza boxes, which is the perfect size for the portion we bring home. For a group of 3, two pizzas is sufficient with no leftovers.   You can add sauce after your pizza is cooked. The drizzle of pesto is pretty tasty! We've had the cinnamon bread once and it was okay for me. Skip! Go walk off the carbs and get yourself some delicious gelato or a cookie ice cream sandwich.",

    "text": "Customizable pizzas in minimal time is not a novel concept: several chains with this style have sprung up recently and I kind of had higher hopes for Pieology. Their featured pies list is small, but the emphasis is obviously on designing your own dinner.   Last time I did this, at another chain, I designed something less than delightful, so I decided to play it safe with the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken. \"Blazin' Buffalo\" has a better ring to it, but I digress. Pie was topped with olive oil (seemed unnecessary), mozzarella and a scant sprinkle of (flavorless) gorgonzola, plain chicken (spicy was also available but not offered?), a ton of red onion slices (a second glance verifies they aren't in the menu description), sub mushrooms instead of cilantro, and add on a buffalo-sauce drizzle after a trip to the oven. As far as taste: the cheese was sort of flavorless, buffalo sauce flavor was dominant, the crust was almost cracker-like with it's crispness. Kind of \"meh.\"  Staff is in need of training. Didn't see a manager around, the assembly-line seemed confused about whether I wanted the buffalo or barbecue pizza (hence the inclusion of the obnoxious amount of red onion), and the guy I interacted with most was extremely soft-spoken: I had to ask him to repeat everything because I couldn't hear him over the music.  Mildly annoyed that no one offered to remake my pie when they realized they were adding the barbecue ingredients instead of the buffalo ones- the giant slices of red onion were a turn off and not supposed to be on the pie at all, but I pointed this out and it was not corrected.  A good, cheap option in the Downtown Summerlin area- $8/meal is not bad, especially considering you should have leftovers. If I come back, I'll try a pesto-pepperoni creation.",

    "text": "After seeing all my yelper friends in Cali post pictures and write favoring reviews about Pieology, I was excited to find out a location had opened up in Downtown Summerlin. I came for dinner and walking inside I noticed they have a spacious dining area with many tables and chairs. I'd say over half of the tables were filled, so the place was busy. I was surprised that because of how busy it was that there was no line where you order your pizza, but there wasn't. Nice! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I explained it was my first time, so he let me take my time looking over the choices. The pizzas are $7.95 each and are 11.5\" in size. You also can choose unlimited toppings.   Choose your crust: Fresh in store made crust or for an additional $2, gluten free crust.  Choose your sauce: Red sauce, herb butter or olive oil.  Choose your toppings: For cheese they have mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and ricotta as options. They have a variety of meats and veggies for toppings ranging from the usual suspects pepperoni, sausage, black olives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers and much more.   Add a flavor blast: Roasted red peppers, fiery buffalo sauce, pesto, bbq sauce, EVOO, black pepper, dollops of red sauce and ranch dressing can be added to any pizza.   I ended up choosing a pizza with red sauce, mozzarella and ricotta on the whole pizza and then 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom and 1/2 tomato and pineapple. They said the pizza would be ready in about 4 and a half minutes. I walked to the register and paid. Our order was to-go, so we waited at the counter for the pizzas. My pizza came out before my husbands and it was just left in a open box until his came out. Our pizzas were ordered at the same time, so I can't figure out why mine would have been ready and his not. We started to notice the staff talking about the pizzas coming out burnt and they even made some of them over again. I noticed one of the employees using the pizza cutter to cut the burnt edges off making the pizza smaller than it should have been for that customer. When our order was finally ready, far past the 4 and a half minute wait time I was originally given, I was off to try out this much raved about pizza.   My pizza was burnt! I was so frustrated at this. The edges were so badly burnt and it tasted terrible. The crust was burnt so badly on one half all under it. Mozzarella cheese was missing on certain parts of my pizza. There could have been more mushrooms and tomatoes on the pizza as well. I'm not sure if a lot of the toppings slid to another part of the pizza while it was baking or what, but I would have hoped when they saw my pizza that they would have made another one since it clearly looked burnt and like the toppings were oddly scattered. My pizza was also not very hot or even warm from being left out in the box for so long before giving it to me. The part of the pizza I was able to eat tasted OK, but definitely below average and nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "Wow,  it's been a minute since I posted a review, as evidenced by the naked profile with the absence of the Elite tag.  Life can do that tho...  I seen this joint when Downtown Summerlin was coming up and finally got to try it for myself.   I am a fan of Novecento, yet,  something tells me Rocco would be disgusted.     Upon entry,  the set up looks a lot like Smash Burger, the way the line corrals you to the upcoming pie slaughter along the chic decorated wall.  There are menus upfront,  but that didn't  help much for the indecisive first time customer that I was.   Eventually,  I just threw the menu in the air and ended up pointing out menu items over the counter like MJ shopping in an antique shop. #RIPMJ  You are offered normal thin crust or gluten free,  several types of sauce from red,  pesto, etc.  I went for the olive oil base then on to the veggies.   I remember basil,  green peppers,  red onions,  artichoke,  two types of olives (?), mushrooms and more.   I like to pile it on when it comes to the green.   Next is the meats which is surprisingly the least exciting in the crescendo.  I opted for pepperoni, sausage and...bacon?!?  I didn't know, I panicked and didn't  want to hold the line up.  All together, the pie totals a little over 8 bones.    Not a bad deal and better than a premium sub sandwich or glutton burger that would equal that price.  Personally,  I think the quick fresh pizza phenomenon is the hook.   Why hit up Sbarro's for pizza way past the danger zone, wilting under a heat lamp, when you can have a decent sized instant pizza minus the nuke process!    My combo wasn't the greatest tho, next time I'll up the stars when I find the right algorithm.  Calling all upscale soccer moms!  We found your next team outing...Booyakah Booyakah!  #shabba",

    "text": "It's nice to see that other customers enjoyed their experience here, but I'd have to say mine was no more than average. A 3.5 stars out of 5 at most.  After the closing of Custom Built, my SO and I heard that Pieology was similar in concept-- a build your own pizza type of establishment, and we were excited to check it out.   The restaurant is bright with plenty of natural light. This is something I take note of in any restaurant. The decor was industrial and comparable to Chipotle's. It was before noon on a weekday, and, luckily, we had gotten there at a decent time; there was plenty of open seating.  Although we understood the concept of the establishment and it's customizable pizzas, I was disappointed to find that the young lady behind the counter who walked over to us gave little to no greeting. In her hands, she held their regular dough and simply asked us what we wanted. We had never been there before and so we asked a few questions about the dough options. They were answered straightforwardly, and no other information was exchanged. Our pizza was topped and slid into the oven. A different employee came over to the register and charged us accordingly. He then  mentioned that our pizza would be brought over to us shortly.  When it arrived, I was happy to find that it was good pizza, and that the person who brought it over was nice and wiped all the surrounding tables. Clean. I'd also like to note that our pizza was not burnt like it had been described in other reviews--it was crisp, light and my SO liked the pizza's sauce. For the price, around $7-$8, I'd eat it again.  My only gripe with this place was the lack of good customer service. It wasn't unpleasant per se, but it certainly didn't make for an ideal lunch out. A smile, a \"have a great day\" or an \"enjoy your meal\" would have been nice.  I'd say that the best phrase for me to describe Pieology would be \"not bad\". Stop by for a quick lunch or afternoon bite! It's inexpensive and has something for everyone. There are tables with sufficient seating for larger groups. Bring your friends!",

Their normal thin crust is really good, and I usually am not a huge fan of thin crust. I got the BBQ chicken pizza with extra barbecue sauce on top and it was great. Definitely try this place!",

    "text": "If we could give a 3 1/2 stars I would but being the case have to give it the 3.. My husband and I have been here twice and the first time was awesome we thought the concept was great. The only thing we could really say was the menu is so small that the only people that can see it are the ones who are at the very front of the line. Also I customize my pizza, since I don't care for meats on pizza, and got all veggies. It took awhile to get our pies and when we did my veggies where still cold(I had mushrooms and they where still white, cooked mushrooms are brownish and soft), but my crust was golden brown. We asked them to reheat it and they did. Veggies where cooked but the crust was burnt now...  Second visit they where pushing us down the line so fast, while being the only ones in line, we didn't get to say we like extra cheese and when we finally got a chance (we where only the next station over) ,and we where told us no, there's Parmesan over there. No?! We are paying, so yes. The worker said it slows down the line(there was only one couple behind us now at this point, so not like there's a huge rush or anything). Finally the manager said fine but only this time.. This time?? How about don't push us so fast down and we can tell u how we like our pizza.. Finally we see they are done cooking and they drop it on the floor no big deal accidents happen and they made us a new one quickly.  Over all it went from being awesome to just eh. Just our biggest complaint is being told no because that's how the owner wants it. But they have to realize customers forget sometimes and being told no over just wanting some extra cheese is ridiculous, because of a line.. Maybe put a larger menu up and ppl would have their minds made up before they get to the ordering station..",

    "text": "This UPDATE is an expansion of my original \"note to self\" review.   Management should pay attention to the negative reviews & act if this place is going to stay open. Not everyone takes to Yelp to leave a review, but they DO walk with their feet & take their $$ elsewhere after a bad experience.   I drove from Silverado Ranch to meet friends here for dinner on a Saturday night. None of us had heard about this place until that day when someone in the group saw it earlier that morning while passing by. I wasn't keen on driving this far to eat somewhere I'd never heard of so I took to Yelp to see what I could find. At the time, the reviews of this place were poorly. I prayed our experience would be different.   There were 4 of us. Saturday night. Empty restaurant. The tables were all pushed together forming straight lines the length of the restaurant. The tables clearly, & were in dire need of, a good wipe down with spray cleaner.   I was the last to order in our group. First, the counter is too high. Being 5'2 I had to stand on my toes to speak to the person on the other side. Rather, shout at. It was too darn loud from the ovens & acoustics. Being deaf in one ear I could barely hear; I can only imagine how someone with full hearing might respond to the noise.   Having read on Yelp something about olive oil being drizzled on the pizza I asked what came on the pizza.  I was told sauce, cheese, toppings. No mention of olive oil. I ordered a gluten free crust with red sauce (toppings were to be told to the next guy).  This employee proceeds with starting my pizza only to grab a squeeze bottle & drizzle something on the red sauce. I halt him & ask what is he doing. \"HUH?\" he replies, only to tell me its olive oil. I asked him to start over as olive oil wasn't what I wanted nor did he tell me it was when I first asked him what came on the pizza. He asks me whats the difference, olive oil is in the red sauce. My response, again, is he never mentioned it prior AND if its in the red sauce already that's fine but I don't need or want more. After an eye-roll & quick shove-outta-the-way of the first pizza he starts over & tosses my pizza like a frisbee to the next guy.  He doesn't notice that I notice him take the original crust with olive oil & face plant it into the bin while muttering under his breath. (It was too loud for me to hear!)  The next guy, again, very hard to see & hear & I am still standing on my toes. He was a bit friendlier, but not by much, & added my requested toppings & put it in the oven. I move down to the next person on this pizza ordering conveyor belt & hand my card to a snobby girl to pay & obtain a number.   I make my way to my friends to see the 3 of them, not 5 minutes after I begin my order at the counter, are halfway through their meal. As the table hadn't been wiped down I had to maneuver around the cheese & peppers left behind by someone else to find a clean spot.  A few minutes later my pizza is brought to the table and the 3 are waiting for me to start eating my meal.  We were seated nearest the entrance and it was STILL noisy!!  We were yelling at each other in order to converse.   My pizza was very pretty: pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers. Very thin crust burnt on the edges. (It is hard to cut thru with plastic knife & fork.)Gooey cheese. I declared it GOOD after my first bite but soon after declared it GROSS as by the 3rd slice my pizza is now room temperature.  I was shocked that not only was the crust black, it had cooled quickly & the taste was so different.  WHAT PRIOR YELPERS HAD EXPERIENCED.   While I was eating, someone decided to come along and not only sweep around our table, they decided to inconvenience me, while eating, to move my legs to sweep under the table & pick up my food to wipe the table down.  UN. REAL.   Sadly, my experience mimicked that of other Yelpers: loud/hard to hear while ordering; rude employees; burnt pizza; great $7.95+tax pizza while hot, gross at room temp.   Within days of posting my \"note to self,\" I received a message from JAKE J claiming to be the GM, asking for a 2nd chance (see pic). I ignored the message & here's why:  i drove from Silverado Ranch for a $7.95+tax pizza...ONCE. My first experience was disappointing, why would I drive that distance again?  (It might not seem far to some but for me it is.) If I lived nearby...maybe. I never go to Summerlin, certainly not making a special trip to have another disappointing experience. I can order a pizza for $8.99 elsewhere, pick it up in less than 10 minutes & enjoy it, hot, room temp, or cold...for dinner AND next days lunch/dinner.   Since I ate there, it appears issues I and those before me remain. It's still too loud. Pizza still comes out burnt. It's still great while hot & blah at room temp.  The employees are still rude. I'm baffled by all the glowing reviews.",

    "text": "these places like pieology have a lot going for them, flame baked, build your own under $10, how can one lose?  welp I got home and proceeded to dig in and I was like huh? ZERO flavor? dunno what the deal was but I had her put some sea salt on it, I put some more and it woke up, again, if you are not looking for 100% flavor driven these places are a hoot, only thing is I would urge them to go check out blaze, same thing but they have more items, the real mazzo balls, maybe twice as many toppings, also figure out why the crust and what not is flavorless? odd it looked so good too, by NO MEANS was it bad, why I gave it a 5, it was a fantastic pizza, but it wasn't over the top flavor wise is all, I would urge more nutritious toppings, wholesome, another thing, put the ingredients all the way to the edge, that's another thing, they left mine about 4\" in from the outside edge so in reality i got a 6\" pizza on a 10\" crust... too funny, yea they can do a lot to make a good place even better... try smoking some toppings or something, put some real nice Italian sausage on the bar, man a pizza without real Italian ground sausage?  anywho final thoughts? I will go to Blaze, closer too..",

Pieology has a really great concept, similar to Chipotle or Subway where you pick your toppings and after paying, they pop it in the oven for several minutes and deliver the pizza to your table. For the most part, the toppings are unlimited for only $8. The pizza is large and the price is such a steal!  I ordered a spicy buffalo pizza with a lot of veggies and feta cheese. It was an interesting combo, but tasted great! Next time, I may try a combo that they recommend. Yelpers must note that the spicy buffalo chicken is pretty spicy!  The veggies tasted fresh, but I may ask for extra cheese next time since it wasn't super cheesy. The crust is thin so even though the pizza is large, I was able to eat most of it. You can also request ranch dressing from the cashier which is a necessity whenever I eat pizza!  This is a great concept, great prices, and good pizza! A recipe for a great restaurant!",

The staff isn't very friendly and have very snippy attitudes. I get the build your own concept but they must also forget Blaze is 2 miles down the road and has better pizza and better quality. The staff is nicer as well. They also charge for Ranch now which is a little ridiculous considering the competition doesn't. I will be taking my business to Blaze going forward.",

    "text": "Absolutely a great experience. If you like Pizza then you must give this place a try! Very clear and bright atmosphere with inspirational sayings on the walls and plenty of open tables and booths for small or large group gatherings.  Here is how it works...you go up to the ordering station...there are several options on the menu that are 'preselected'. You might select a standard personal size pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza. Which are great selections. However, here is where this place shines...you can make your own pizza! Yes, that's right! you can verbally craft it right there just as if you were making it yourself! And the fire up the pizza right in front of you! There are a lot of different toppings so if you want that rare elusive pineapple and anchovy combination....this is the place for you! I will definitely be bringing others here for lunch!  It is worth noting that the quality of pizza here is 'different' that if you go to a Chicago or New York style pizza joint. It is 'faster' food. So the type of pizza served here is simply different than the aforementioned styles of pizza.  That being said Pieology is pizza done right because it is designed by you! Come on by and get a pie!",

PIEOLOGY is definitely a worthy meal I could enjoy daily.   Similar to other Chipotle style BYO pizza places, for one price you can pile on the toppings. For $7.95 you can have as much or as little as you like.  BYO is simple or course.  Start with crust, then pick your sauces, cheeses, veggies and meats. They offer gluten free for an extra $2.  I liked the crust here it was not quite a circular shape giving it a rustic appeal and it was also thin and crispy.    Today we went for the Easy Cheesy because that is what the kiddo would eat. However I will be back to attack a fully loaded pizza in the next week.  I can guarantee that.",

The answer was no, only one topping on Kid's pizza.  I said I would pay for the extra topping.  They said they would have to charge the full adult price of $8.49. He settled for one topping.  Also no drink size for kids so paid the full price of $2.29.  I ordered a Cauliflower Crust Pizza.  The crust was not bad but my pizza was undercooked.  It was like eating a salad on a crust. I found out when I reviewed my receipt that the Cauliflower crust was a $2.50 up charge.  I did not see that posted anywhere and was not told by the girl taking my order. I also thought the eating area was a bit dirty, especially the floor and bench seats. I likely won't be back.",

It's fast, super affordable for unlimited toppings ($7), and very satisfying. The original crust itself is thin and crisp, and has olive oil applied before hand to enhance the flavor and crunchiness. They have a very nice variety of toppings including multiple types of cheeses, sauces, meats, and vegetables; and if you want, they can even mix the sauces together which is nice. The area itself is reasonably spacious, and during the main eating hours, it can be pretty packed, which is usually a tell tale sign that you are about to indulge in something good. I really appreciate the location as well because I feel that Summerlin is a good midpoint for a lot of my friends, so no one has to really drive far to meet up here.",

They have a variety of sauces, cheeses, meats and toppings. You can definitely make an assortment of pizzas, flavors and creations. My son loved that he could put more parmesan on his mozzarella.  It is a laid back restaurant and the atmosphere matches. The service was also on point. If you have never been there it can be a buy overwhelming, the menu from the beginning can be an eye opener but once you get started they all help you along the way (in respect to ordering).  The pizza came out pretty quick and were really good. Only thing is the crust was super thin, not sure if they offer thicker crust. So if you don't love thin crust this may not be the spot for you.

I had to wait for that entire order to finish being prepared, held up the entire line, I couldn't even pay before him. that's annoying. they should've at least allowed for my pizza to be put in versus forcing me to wait any further.

And I would advise patrons to specify how much of each topping you want. They seem willing to accommodate you--if you ask. I will be going back!",

Yet the person behind me in line had twice as much cheese as I had. Not happy at all I can say even before tasting it, it will already be bitter. For 11.95 for a drink and pizza get an unlimited topping with no restrictions at Pizza Revolution. Now I see why they are a revolution and not a theology.",

That was very convenient.   Food was delivered to our table and the employee even went out of his way to grab us some ranch.   I would come here again.   Other than that one of our pizzas was a little toasty on the edges but it's not a big deal. It was still good.",

Very skimpy when asking for ricotta, even with it being the only cheese requested. I asked for more and got no response, just a pile of ricotta smacked onto the pizza and it was then passed down the line. Well, thank you, sir. The next girl asked what I wanted. I said basil. She then asked if that was all before I even had a chance to ask for anything else. I said no and asked for garlic. She grabbed a handful and it ended up in three piles (big piles) on the pizza. I kind of chuckled and asked if she could spread it out a bit. Again, no response, she didn't want to spread it out so I got just another pile of garlic and an evil look. Two incredibly rude employees and a crappy looking pizza. I should've taken a picture, but instead I stood there for at least 2 minutes before another guy asked me if I would like anything else. I politely explained that it was a disaster and when I asked the girl to change the garlic it did not work out for me, among other things. At this point I didn't even know what to do, this was a first for me. Obviously these ppl could not have cared less. I told the man that I did not want it and was going to leave. He asked to remake it and the girl that messed part of it up gave me a very evil look and made some comment as well. This place is similar to Blaze Pizza. The idea is the only thing similar though! Blaze is amazing, not only great pizza but great people!! I would never recommend Pieology and will definitely not give it another shot.",

I was very surprised by the quantity of options I could choose from with zero extra cost from ANYTHING (unlike everywhere else where certain options charge extra). The atmosphere is very inviting with upbeat music. I enjoyed the seat yourself long table dining experience.

I've tried this place a few times and each time I come away with feeling like there is something missing.   Normally,  I love thinner crust pizza. But I find the crust here rather flavorless and cardboard like in consistency. It doesn't even have the flakiness of a True cracker crust.   I have tried their herb butter and red sauce. Neither one is inspiring and both taste bland. The cheese blends are also pretty boring flavorwise.   The toppings also fall flat for me. The proteins -  ham, sausage,  etc tastes too generic. The veggies are kind of basic as well.   When my order gets fired, I usually get either a super burnt edges (despite the oiling of the crust) or I get soggy in the middle (with me really restraining myself with toppings.

They have a great selection of choices, which are all $7.95 for each pizza no matter how many toppings! We ended up getting 2 pizzas and a side of the garlic bread and a drink, all for $22! A part of me wished the dough options would involve a pan style crust because I love that stuff but it ended up being a perfect amount for me to finish without feeling that food-coma laziness after I ate.  I'm excited for my next visit so I can make a new combination of toppings",

And my friend ordered red sauce, all veggies, sausage and pepperoni.  Pizzas came out beautifully cooked and I enjoyed every luscious bite of my pizza. I must say, either I picked the right ingredients which fits my hunger or they put TLC on their toppings because the pizza tasted better than expected. Also better than my past previous check-ins :-)    I'll be coming back often; very satisfied with the improvements.",

You start with a choice of regular, cracker thin crust (thinner crust than Grimaldi's) or gluten free for $2 extra. Then pick your sauce - red, herb butter, or olive oil.  I chose the traditional marinara sauce and the employee put an olive oil base before lathering on the sauce.  Next comes the cheese which includes mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, feta, and gorgonzola. Then you choose the meats (bacon, pepperoni, sausage, meatball), veggies, herbs, and a flavor blast (pesto, buffalo, ranch, etc).   I went with the regular crust with red sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, pepperoni, meatball, jalapenos, & mushrooms. No herbs and flavor blast this time.   Obviously, your pizza will take a few minutes so take a # and wait patiently for your pizza. My customized pizza was delicious! Check out my pizza!",

The pizzas are very tasty. I had spicy buffalo sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheese and spicy chicken pieces. The pizza came after about 3 or 4 minutes and was perfectly cooked; very crunchy thin crust. My only complaint is that the guy putting toppings on was very stingy. Maybe they expect people to do tons of toppings, so they only do a little bit of each, but I only wanted a couple and had to ask for extras to cover the pizza evenly. I'll be back though.",

I loved how fast my pizza cooked and the unlimited toppings, the people working the line are always friendly and it is super cheap - $7.95 for a larger size personal pizza.  But honestly I am writing this review because I have experienced bad customer service here. One of the people who I assume to be a manager (I assume they were a manager- they had on a different shirt than the others working) was laughing and gossiping about customers the last time I came in. I normally am not one to point fingers, but I am very sure of what I heard and I am very disappointed in pieology as a company for choosing people who talk anything other than decently about guests -regardless of their actions or demeanors - as their leaders. I joined yelp to write this review because I was so disappointed in what I overheard. I really hope corporate sees this and makes note of it.   Other than that, the employees making the pizzas are very attentive and cheerful and are always cleaning tables and interacting positively with those enjoying their pizzas. I felt welcomed by everyone while I was moving though the toppings and even the person at the register was nice and full of smiles, and that feeling continued on while I was eating, as I was asked if I needed anything else and if the pizza was good, which it was. Overall: good pizza, questionable management",

Today 12/10/2016 at 6:03pm was the last time that I ever visit Pieology.

The way they do it is the front clearly shows the flat rate price for the pizza so that's what you think you're getting, but they then ask you what type of crust you want, but at least one of the crusts is $1+ additional, but they won't tell you that- they hide their intention to charge you more. Then they will try to do more add-ons at the register, for example, they sometimes automatically add a drink even if you don't order one and suggest that it's 'included' even though it is not. Obviously their goal is to get $2+ more out of you. Customers are aware of these sleazy marketing tactics and hate companies who deceive people. What they're doing is unethical and hopefully they will learn once they get enough complaints.",

Each topping is measured in a scoop and spread lightly over the pizza then put into the fiery oven. Just wish all the toppings came out hot, the pre-cooked meat toppings were a little cold still, but the dough and cheese turned out just right. Overall great selection of toppings and good flavor fun.",

They also have gluten-free pizza bread to choose from (for an additional cost) and a yummy variety of different toppings, whether it be cheese, meat, or veggies.  If I could make any recommendation for the management to consider, I think they would really do well with actual plates. Sharing a pizza is great, but when you're both trying to use the pan as a plate, it's not the best. If you want plates, you have to go to the register, where they actually provide you a to-go box instead.   Parking in this area can be pretty difficult in the daytime but I do think this is worth the wait!   Customized pizza? Yessss!",

After my family and I paid for our pizzas I had to go use the men's restroom and that's when I realized that the employee that kept rushing to the hall way was cleaning up a mess that happened. I tried to go use the men's restroom anyway and she began to told me that it's out of order because it over flooded, I had to use the women's restroom instead but damn Pieology get your stuff together have at least 5 people working at once than 2!

The ingredients they use are fresh and unlike Subway they aren't stingy with the cheese or meats ;) The pizzas themselves are pretty small at around 11-12in I want to say. It's probably not enough to share with 2 people but it's definitely good enough for one adult.  They have a number of different toppings for both meats and veggies. Once you pick your toppings they throw it in the oven which usually cooks the pizza in less than 10 minutes. I love how FRESH and thin crust the pizzas come out and being a pizza snob myself I'd say the quality of pizza here is pretty good.  The only knock I give this place is that because they create your pizza on the spot, the lines can get pretty long and move slow. I see a lot of complaints about the slow service but every time I've gone, there has been barely any line.  For a fully customizable pizza for $10 ready in 10 minutes or less, I love this joint!!",

Italians are swimming across the Atlantic Ocean and running all the way to the west coast just to smell this pizza it is so delicious.  The price is also just so amazing to I mean you get a whole pizza to yourself for like 10 bucks I mean you cant beat that.

Don't trust anyone that doesn't like pizza.   So when you walk in they ask you what kind of sauce. Do yourself a favor and get the herb buyer AND marinara sauce, you're welcome! After that you get to pick all the toppings your hungry heart desires. Might not want to go a little too crazy though because it might get a little soggy. But hey it's a personal pizza and you're not sharing so get whatever you want!  After they bake it, you have the option to put sauces after too! I like to get pesto drizzled on it!   A personal pizza for about $8 is definitely worth it. I'd come here more regularly if I didn't mind gaining 2863672 pounds, but when I'm having a pizza craving, this is the spot to go.",

It will hold up the line to it is against health regulations. I can't order my \"made to order\" pizza the way I want it because the way they layout the toppings in their assembly line. Then to top it off they burnt the pizza crust. My kids had to cut off outer crust and only ate the inside third of the pie. Terrible. First and last visit.",

You can choose from gluten free, wheat or just a regular pizza crust. You can choose your sauce, and a wide variety of toppings. They are fast and efficient and if you're into thin crust this gives you another option.",

I asked for a drizzle of BBQ on top of my chicken pizza and it was smothered in it. It tastes terrible.  The people sitting next to us ordered a dessert pizza (brown sugar cinnamon butter on dough, drizzled with icing) and it looked like someone smeared crap on pizza dough and then came on it. Even the lady didn't think she should be eating it.   Super unimpressed. And I know I'm not alone as everyone in the restaurant was complaining.",

The dining room is sometimes crowded. We just waited 4-5 minutes for our pizza and it was pretty yummy and flavorful. The dining room is also very clean. I call this the Subway of pizza.

The are very Celiac Friendly. I was unsure about eating here because the website states that they don't recommend the GF crust for those with Celiac's due to the common kitchen. I took the chance to give it a try and I am so glad that I did.   When I ordered the first question asked of me if this was because of a preference of allergy. As soon as I stated allergy the employee took of his gloves and used a brand new pair. The pizza was placed on a special board to be made and was cooked on a special pizza plate and was placed away from the other pizzas in the oven to avoid cross contamination as much as possible. I was very impressed with them and absolutely loved my pizza.",

The guy was putting the sauce and cheeses and we weren't done with telling him what kind of cheeses we want yet and he'd pass it down the line already. I also told him for the sauce I wanted BBQ and he just assumed I wanted the BBQ chicken pizza they had and started making that. Moving on to the girl adding toppings, like I said she was really grumpy, no greeting and was throwing the toppings on the pizza. I get it, everyone has off days but we're still paying customers and we just felt really awkward asking for toppings coz we felt how unhappy she was to be there and it really showed. The cashier was a lot nicer, but they were very unorganized with their communication that I had to keep repeating how many pizzas we had ordered. Pizzas are ok here, especially for $8 a piece. The BBQ pizza came out with no BBQ sauce but the cashier girl who brought it out quickly fixed it. food here is ok for the price. It's getting a 2 star because of the service.",

    "text": "My family really loved Pieology!  For $7.95, you build your own custom 11\" pizza. Perfect for us since we all like something different on our pizza.   No extra charges for each topping, same price, no matter what you want on your pizza!  It's a very thin crispy crust.  My one complaint would be that they should turn the pizza at least once while in the oven.  I noticed on all 6 of our pizzas that one half was burnt at the edge; it was the half that was closest to the fire in the oven. If they turned the pizza at least once, they would cook more evenly and avoid the burnt crust.  And $2.95 for a fountain drink seems high, but I guess they have to make money somewhere ;-) The staff was friendly, the store was clean and the food was delicious.  We will definitely visit this Pieology again.  Would love to see a location in North Las Vegas; Summerlin is a long drive for us, so we don't eat here as often as we would like.",

Felt like she's trying to get me out of there. If it does say unlimited toppings, it means unlimited toppings. not go cheap or put less on toppings than I requested. Had to ask a girl three times to put extra toppings on my pizza. Like I was at Subway instead of a nice pizza place.   Will never return to this place. Owners of this place need to stop hiring high school kids or Young kids who doesn't care about their work ethics or come to work just because for a paycheck. You get paid to do one job which is to make a freaking pizza for what customers are requesting.

I always ask for double bacon and they always oblige me without a hitch. There are 4 types of sauce and you can even do half and half, which is what I do (half marinara and half pesto). There are unlimited toppings, but don't put too many because I saw a woman being greedy and piling any and everything onto her pizza and when she started eating it she started complaining that it was undercooked, when in actuality it was just soggy because she put too many toppings on it and that happens at most pizza places.  Only problem I've ever had was the that on my last visit, the sauce girl chose to squeeze and squeeze a bottle of pesto that was pretty much empty, instead of just getting a new bottle. When I got my pizza, I felt like my pesto side really didn't have enough sauce. However, that was not bad enough for me to stop coming here or to take a star off, she was probably trained to be cost efficient, however maybe next time she could do that, but also go get another bottle and give me a fair serving of sauce.",

I was already on the fence regarding ordering the rustic, now I had more options. I ended up getting the following toppings (red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, red onion mushrooms, artichokes, grape tomatoes, jalapenos, black olives, garlic spread on whole wheat crust). I ordered \"to go vs. dining in\" which was my 1st mistake & 2nd I think the toppings were too much for the thin crust, but I am also under the impression the cooking duration wasn't long enough.    The concept here remindered me of an upgraded Papa Murphy's with an oven . To be fair the toppings were fresh, staff very courteous, location clean with cool life quotes on the wall. I'm willing to give this location another try sometime in the future. If you decide to eat here plan on dining in, the pizza doesn't hold heat well for a trip ride across town & is very messy if you plan on eating it in the car.",

    "text": "My husband & I come here all the time but unfortunately after this experience I never want to come back again. I'll take my business to Blaze or Pizza Rev.   First we walk in with no greeting, while to boys are right in front of us making some pizzas. I understand they're doing something but a greeting would be nice. About 2-3 mins of standing there they took our orders. We came to try the deep dish crust but they were out. Their work station was a complete mess...olives in the corn, meat mixed in with other meats. What if someone has allergies?!?   Next we order a fountain drink but were never told all of the diet options were unavailable. This has happened in the past that they didn't have low calories options but we were always told ahead of time & they usually have a sign up on the machine.   After we sit for a bit a young Asian girl delivers our order, which is not our pizza. I bring it back to the register. I get handed another pizza, which is still not one of the two of our pizzas. A young man named Sebastian asks me if I remember the number, which I did not. He looked around and then asked me twice more, like I was an idiot. Both the girl & Sebastian looked around for the pizzas, while I just stood there. They finally take my pizza out of the oven & it's burnt. They give me my husband's pizza & I bring it to the table...it's not his pizza. He has to bring it back up AGAIN & get the correct pizza.   Horrible service from beginning to end. The food area is a mess. The workers have no idea what they're doing & the have one young man with a nasty attitude. Although the young Asian girl was messing up, she was very nice. Now I'm sitting here angry with a burnt pizza, empty fountain cup & a plan to never come back again. DO NOT COME HERE!!!",

I have to say that it was a little confusing at first understanding how to order and that the price was just the price for unlimited toppings. If you have ever had to order a cheesesteak at Pat's or Geno's in Philly you understand the anxiety I felt in line here.  There were so many options and it was really hard to get through, I think I would have appreciated just a bit more guidance on what I was doing for the first time.   Pizza came out of the wood-fired oven really quick and we devoured the pizza, it was baked perfectly.   It is a nice casual atmosphere here and they have this watermelon ice tea that is super delicious.   All in all if you are looking for a good priced, quick, family type place definitely go here.",

A Bit Disorganized On This Visit  Nov. 30, 2017  Again,  more staff up front instead of the back would have probably helped.  Our Pizza sat up there getting cold until we reapproached  the counter asking for our pie!  Pizza was not bad, it also wasn't great either.   Pepperoni Pizza was bland and lacked flavor.  Salad was really good. The Spinach in my salad was fresh, candied walnuts were  delicious!! I ordered mine without the vinegertte dressing and blue cheese crumbles.  They did make my salad as I ordered, because they were practically out of that paticular salad upfront.  If I return it  probably won't be for awhile. I  think I will skip Pieology next time.",

To my surprise as it's been a few months or so since I've been here they upgraded their menu! So excited for all the new options. My only disappointment is they don't offer vegetarian meat options and they stopped selling Spindrift! Which was definitely my biggest disappointment as this location introduced me to the Spindrift brand. I grabbed an Alta Palla and it's just not the same flavor and pairing to pizza for me. But the new crust I got is delicious and they even offered ranch on the side and have desserts now! So it's good to see change but bring back my Spindrift!!",

We decided to skip Costco's pizza line and come here and I'm sure we would've been served faster over at Costco.   The girl who took the order was real sweet, her name was Ash. I told her to not be shy with the sauce. I also noticed they had Daiya vegan cheese, which really brought a smile to my face. I ordered the thick crust for $1 more. It wasn't that much thicker than the regular crust, but very delicious. I ordered pepperoni, chicken, spinach and pineapple. My daughter had ham and pineapple on her pizza.   We definitely had enough left over, but I'd say we would have better luck and quicker service any other day besides Friday.",

This is why I was a little scared of coming to eat here again.   I wanted to give it another shot, I really wanted to like it ! I ordered a thick crust pie with spinach, pepperoni, traditional red sauce, some olive oil, bacon, mozzarella, pesto, garlic, basil and a pinch of salt. For some reason the dough was so so very bland ! I was a bit surprised, my boyfriend also commented on how thin his pizza was, it was really thin lol..   For the lady who took my order : IM SORRY for putting my hand over the glass",

    "text": "Hooray for vegan pizza! My friend and I ate at Pieology Pizzeria in Downtown Summerlin for our post-hike meal. According to the Pieology nutritional information available on the website, the whole wheat crust is vegan (at least from what I can tell). This location also has daiya cheese, which is a welcome addition to any pizza menu.   RUSTIC VEGGIE ($7.99): Minus the mozzarella and ricotta cheese in favor of daiya cheese. This pizza is loaded with tons of veggies, to include corn, red and green bell peppers, and basil. I added mushrooms for good measure (at not additional cost I might add). This pizza was packed with flavor, although the crust is on the thinner side and the pizza itself was pretty floppy. The personal sized pizza is more than enough for one person, and I had 3 slices leftover.   The pizzeria was clean and our food was out within 10 minutes. I'll definitely go back to Pieology if I'm in the area and am craving a vegan pizza.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #1",

You start out with a 12 inch, very thin crust pizza (regular or wheat, I believe are the choices), and then select your sauce, cheeses, meats, and veggies. As this can be a little overwhelming, you can also select one of their creations if you prefer.  After paying at the counter, they bring the pizza to your table. There are fountain drinks and even to-go boxes for your leftovers available.  The pizza itself was quite good! The toppings were fresh and the crust was tasty.   All of the pizzas, whether you load it up with toppings or not, are about $8, which is a very fair price. I only wish there was an option for hand-tossed or deep dish pizzas.",

And if you're in a rush, you can get your pizza in all of 5 minutes. Can't beat that.  Since this place is pretty self explanatory, I'll just tell you how I made my special pizza.  SAUCE: red sauce. And extra red sauce. VEGETABLES: basil, red onions, green peppers, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, roasted tomatoes, garlic (the server probably thought I was a vegetarian) MEATS: meatball, ham, pepperoni Result: fantastic.  The Hubby's pizza:  SAUCE: herb butter and 3 cheese alfredo VEGETABLES: red onions, garlic, cilantro MEATS: spicy chicken, sausage, bacon  Result: i thought it was salty but the hubby thought it was great!  We both loved the super crispy thin crust. So yummy. We were going to take the pizza to go, but we were too tempted to try at least one slice. Well, one slice became half a pizza. It is best to eat the pizza hot!!  We'll be coming back.. A lot!",

Stopped in on Friday for lunch with a few co-workers.Wait was about 10 minutes to get up to the register to order. They don't seem to be skimpy with the toppings like Pizza Rev. Crust wasn't that flavorful in my opinion. But with the ability to put lots of toppings on it I was able to get some good flavor out of the pie. Venue is extremely loud when you get a few people in there due to the open ceiling layout & nothing to absorb the noise so it was a bit annoying to have to shout across the table to each other. Location is a bit far to travel to from my work so won't be going there much. Plus I think Blaze Pizza tastes better. An \"A-OK\" review since they don't skimp on the toppings.",

I ended up making my own custom pizza with herb garlic butter on the crust and house red sauce with mozzarella/parmesan cheese. I topped my pizza with sausage, pepperoni, spicy chicken and veggies. I opted out of the after bake, but next time I will definitely try. The pizza came out pretty quickly and I also purchased a spindrift raspberry and cranberry drink. Only downside is they should offer recycling for plastic and glass bottles. Overall atmosphere was pretty laid back and I will definitely go back!",

When I came across pieology many years ago in California, I embraced them as an interesting \"chipotle like\" build your own pizza.  The quality of the ingredients were fair, the amount you could put on was great as the price overall was reasonable. With that said, I have enjoyed pieology over the years and have liked going to this location in downtown Summerlin.  Overall I am satisfied with my experiences with pieology; they have incorporated different crusts over the years including cauliflower (my favorite as it crisps up nicely).  A couple of drawbacks I saw at this location and maybe it's a corporate wise thing, is the efficiency of the pizza making line.  I feel some of the items on the line should be cut up like say the meatballs to make it easier for the worker to place it on the pizza.  The other drawback was a person running to bring pizzas and manning the register at the same time.  These are just observations and shouldn't take away from the fact that all the people that were working there are working their tails off.  In any case, I recommend pieology for a quick bite for family, friends etc. for a meal you create that's reasonably priced.   If you're expecting New York pizza.....fuggettaboutit!!!",

Once we got to the front, we waited another 10 minutes, because they were taking online orders. Despite being in their view, the staff member ignored us. 4. Lastly, the manager seemed overwhelmed with her staff and failed to provide any direction. Once in a while she scolded at them, but remained focus in the back. Our experienced here left a bad impression and we highly doubt recommending this establishment for another school fundraiser.",

The staff is great and very friendly. Jessica especially has great customer service. She always remembers us, very hard working and makes sure we're given the best service. Her sense of caring is very genuine which is very rare in this town. I can easily say that we've been to a number of restaurants of all kinds in Las Vegas, and the customer service that Jessica and the staff provide stands out immensely and will continue to have us as customers because of it.",

They never have enough people working. They have all of the employees trying to do multiple things at the same time and it doesn't work. They try to up-charge for everything and then don't tell you until you go to check out.  They are EXTREMELY cheap about everything. The manager lady (I think) is rude about everything, every time I go. They burnt our pizza (which we requested to be lightly cooked) and their solution was to just cut all of the crust off (and that is how it was served).",

From there I do my regular order of red sauce, mozz, ricotta, tons of veggies and meats etc then pound away at that scrumptious meal.   But this location is weird, the first time I went there 2 employees were talking and only one was taking customers. This was rather annoying as the line was somewhat long, and the other 2 could have easily stopped laughing and joking to help customers. You should NEVER take breaks together when there is a line!   The second time I went there was also less than stellar, they went super cheap on the cheese and I had to ask for more. Then they continued to put on very few ingredients which was a bummer and when I asked for my normal \"Mexican amount of Jalapenos\" she put like 3. My pizza was not spicy or scrumptious like I normally like it and was rather disappointed. I suppose I will have to try one of the farther Pieology locations instead.",

She informs me that I can place a new order there.  We did that and she charged me again saying that she will call them to refund my money.  It was never refunded and we went to the other location the following week.   I spoke to the manager and he said he will look at it and give me credit and continue doing his job.  He did not take a not of my name or phone number to inform me of the status.

About 5 minutes later, your pizza is sitting in front of you.  All the pies are 12 inches (Pieology says 11.5 inches) and no matter how many toppings you want, it's a very affordable $7.95.  A plain cheese pizza is $6.95.  You get to build upon your choice of three crusts (\"house made\", whole wheat or gluten free).  Then pick your sauce:  red, herb butter, pesto, BBQ, spicy buffalo, and  a few others.  Or skip the sauce entirely and just paint your crust with olive oil!  Then you add your choice of about two dozen toppings and enjoy get ready for a treat.  If you're not in a creative mood, they have several recommendations you can pick from as well.  There are a few salad choices if you want some greenery, and a few desert options as well.  Give it a shot!  Tasty, fast and friendly!

I love that this place has custom built pizza with unlimited toppings for such a low price. $8 is a great deal in Summerlin.   With that said, I would still prefer to order a pizza from a chain, and it would be cheaper.  I made the mistake of getting the garlic-butter-olive oil combination as my base (I am not the biggest fan of sauce). The employee basically poured it on. Boy, was it overwhelming. When you got a lot of the roasted garlic in your bite, it was very sweet. Not my favorite. It would be better in a much smaller quantity.   The pizza was well cooked. I liked the cheeses and pepperoni.  I was that they hand stretched their dough like at Project Pie. The crust here felt very storebought. I like that they have the gluten free option.   My favorite thing about this pizza was that unlike Settebello and 800 Degrees, everything doesn't slide off when you pick up a slice. That gets very annoying.  Overall, not a bad place, but I won't be making a special trip for it.",

The different cheese, toppings, and how much you can add to your pizza makes this awesome for me. I love that I can choose a lot of toppings and it all costs the same price. I use the motto, if it's good, just put it in, and that is exactly what I do. I can't argue with the flat rate for customizing a pizza and nobody should be able to too. Give this place a visit!",

    "text": "What is not to like about a place that makes your pizza fast and good. The service is friendly and prompt. The price is very good for a fresh made pizza. The topping choices are amazing. I love the thin crust too.  You can have any topping you want for the same price. I think it was ~$8 for 12 inch pizza. I top mine with sun dried tomatoes, double artichokes, spinach, sausage, mozzarella, bell pepper, and ham. They have other toppings like pineapple, mushroom, chicken, etc. Believe me, there are just too many toppings to list. It will be more than enough. Too much and it gets soggy. As a result, my girl likes to get her own simpler pie and I get mine drenched. I can't help it. If you can't tell, I love the Costco pizza too. Since I live near both, I can have either one. But this one is way more gourmet.  The menus are nice and big behind the cashier's like In n Out. You can see them making it in front of you. All the toppings are freshly laid out. I am terrible at choosing between options so I try to just think of toppings together and throw it in. As opposed to the girl in front of me who was deciding on toppings with her friend next to her and her bf on the phone while wearing flip-flops, pajama pants, and a jacket, because it's cold outside. So between me looking at the poor employee frowning and waiting for her to finish so she can help me and the small line behind me, I look at the ceiling with exaggerated interest, as this dotard ruminates between each topping. I imagined what Curly would do with a lemon meringue pie instead of pizza. Some people are so inconsiderate. So please, just because you can hold up the line, you don't have to exercise that option and have a phone conversation while ordering. Don't people like that just annoy you?  There is a take out menu too so you can order and pick up. You know, for those times when there's a slipper wearing Korean girl (I'm Asian so I can cry foul with impunity, and if not, well in my defense, at least I didn't go in winter wearing pajama pants and my house slippers. Now I will have to apologize to my Korean friends for bashing a fellow K girl, bah. Babo.) in front ordering on the phone with her bf and you just want your pizza pie and go. Which is exactly what I did 2 weeks later. I didn't want to oogle their ceiling again, just in case slipper girl was there again! They were even nice enough to ask how far away we lived so that they knew when to make the  pizza. Whoa, say what? We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. Now that's good service!  To satisfy a pizza craving and a quick bite to eat, I highly recommend this place. I'd give it 5 stars but I am afraid there might be something out there who deserves 5 stars and I nonchalantly have been giving everyone five stars.",

I cant judge this place against other places, but I really enjoyed my 'za. I got pesto with mozzarella+gorgonzola cheese, chicken, bacon, olives, artichoke hearts, and fresh basil. Im sure my breath could kill a man afterwards, but it was worth it. My wife got pepperoni. I like this option as I don't have to compromise what I like when getting pizza. Ive had better pizza at many other places, but this place gets points for the concept.",

Ingredients are always fresh and pizzas always taste great no matter what you put on it. The only thing that makes coming here not so great is the service. This place gets busy and the staff seems very unorganized. They give us numbers for our orders to put on our table but they still come by with pizzas and ask if that's what we ordered. After a couple tries we got the right pizzas. If they really tried to stay organized with orders they would be even better.",

This girl was seriously leaning on the register as she was ringing us up. Once confronted by my sister about her horrible customer service all she had to say was \"oh sorry it's because I pushed the wrong button\" which had nothing to do with her lack of customer service! She didn't even incorrectly enter anything it was just a lame excuse for her being called out on it. The only ones that seemed nice were the guys in the back of house but that's only because they seemed very new. Once we sat down and we're waiting for our food it got worse! They seriously could not figure out whose pizzas belonged to who (even though they are suppose to be ticketed to match your number!!!) So bad to the point that they gave our pizzas away to a customer seating a few tables away! They were taking forever to bring our pizzas that I got up to look for them. As I was walking to get them I overheard the customer telling the team member those pizzas didn't belong to her, they were ours! In about the 40 minutes we were there they had at least three other customer complaints about their missing pizzas. How do you lose pizzas!!? A couple customers requested their money back. After a while it seems that the Manager in charge finally came out to assess the situation but by then the damage was done!",

He must have forgotten because when he returned shortly after, he started collecting plates and asking people how everything was going. We had to ask the manager to assist us.

Tons of options in each department and the best part is its unlimited. Extra cheese, extra meat, extra veggies? No problem! Unlimited must be pricey then eh? Nope, $7.95 but that doesn't include a drink which is about an extra $2 depending on the size. (No beer). Like I said earlier the pizza is the perfect lunch size (for a guy like me at least).  The location is a bit out of the way in the Downtown Summerlin area. The interior is large with plenty of tables just like a typical fast food spot.   A quick, perfect pizza piled high with the toppings you want that won't burn a hole in your pocket. Stop by and check it out. I'll be back soon for sure and next time bring Her.",

While on our way to the mall at Downtown Summerlin, we noticed Pielogy im the parking lot. We originally planned on going to MTO Cafe for lunch but decided to give Pieology a try. We were thinking that it would be similar to Pizza Rev. We walked in, peeped around and yes sir indeed it was just like Pizza Rev!!  Ordering your custom pizza is a very simple process. Staff were not stingy w/ the ingredients and let you pile on as much as you want. The price isn't bad at all for $7.95.  I was surprised at the Pieology experience and will be definitely going back.

When we arrived, the place was still rather lively despite being a half hour before closing on a weekday. The employees were very friendly and kindly made our food for us. Even though we had arrived close to closing, they put no pressure on us to \"hurry up and get out\". We were willing to take our food to go but they insisted that we dine-in if we preferred.   We paid about 9 bucks for a custom bbq chicken pizza that my boyfriend and I split. It was very tasty and the only thing I didn't like was there was too much BBQ sauce around the edges, which made things a little messy. Regardless, that's an easy fix and I'll make sure to point it out to the person making my pizza next time.   Overall, a very fun, cheap, and tasty place to go to if you are in the mood for pizza and don't want to share. My favourite part of this experience is that you can get as many toppings and cheeses as you want. My friend got every type of cheeze they had to offer. It was INSANE...and delicious.",

They use a thin crust dough and they add toppings in front of you the same way they would at most sub-sandwich shops. The pizza is cooked and served within 10 minutes. The pizzas are reasonably priced as well. The food is good and the staff is friendly.  I like this place, located in the Summerlin mall area. It's got a nice look and feel and they have a nice selection of toppings. They have specialty pizzas which include the number of calories for each pizza which is nice for me because I do try to count calories as best I can.

    "text": "A few weeks ago I called in an order for a pizza and was told it would be ready in 45 MINUTES. I was shocked and the response on the other end was that \"there was a long line\"...? That's why I'm calling ahead? To skip the line? Right? Like just put the pizza in? Upon picking up the pizza I had to wait in said line for another 40 minutes to pay. The takeout system is 0/10.  I decided to give it another chance, called ahead again, and was told it would take 10 minutes. AWESOME GREAT GOOD JOB GUYS! Nope. I got there when they said it would be done but had to wait another 10 minutes. They brought out a burnt pizza. I then waited another 30 minutes for a new one.   Never coming here again.",

I am a big fan of their product and find their pizzas, when made properly, some of the best in town. Unfortunately the service and pies are so inconsistent. I've been at least four times and twice had horrible pizza. The first time, the pizza was beyond burnt because they were busy and not paying attention. The second time, they dropped the pizza as it came out of the oven and had to remake it. Not to mention, each time they've had to remake my pizza, they throw it together so fast that they skimp on the toppings and I'm left with a half ass pizza. It's too bad because it could be a great place. I wish management would take a closer look at the day to day operations. Good luck.",

It's just disappointing when you're trying to be in a rush and they can't accommodate you. Decent pizza but maybe just a once in a while type of place.

For the most part, it's consistent. The ingredients are fresh and there is an extremely noticeable difference in the quality of the pizza compared to a chain.  Understand that this place gets crowded! This is an extremely busy mall and 'Merica loves pizza....It's not unusual for there to be 50 people inside the place and a totally full oven. Be patient when you come at busy hours, because the line can stretch outside the door. A good time I found to go so far is around 2-3 or after 8.

Luckily, Pieology allows me to put as many vegetable toppings as I want! Love that it's thin crust and you have the option of whole wheat!  It's also affordable and around $10 a pizza, which you can easily share with someone, making this meal cheaper than many fast food places.  Although the pizza did surprise me with it's affordability and customizable options, it was the service that really blew me away. Everyone was SO FRIENDLY and did not seem fake at all. Even at more upscale or expensive restaurants I don't receive such great service! The pizza was good, but the fact that I felt happier walking out than I did walking in is what makes Pieology 5/5.   Tip: Get the vegetable pizza but replace tomato sauce with pesto!",

The place was being run by either teenagers or young adults who seemed to be messing around a little, but I didn't think much of it at the time.   My daughter and I went through the process of picking the toppings and paying for the pizza which went fine. We sat and a little while later we could smell our pizzas burning which caused me to look up to see what was happening.   One young man was spending time changing the change in the tip jar into dollars and apparently forgot them. I observed this, but no one came and talked to me, they just hastily put together another pizza for me, which was a mess, then cooked it in a rush (as in, it wasn't cooked enough, dough was still underdone) and handed it over. Not once did they mention what happened, and didn't seem to notice that I was watching the process.  We got them to go, and after waiting 20 minutes through this process, I just wanted to leave so I took what they gave me even with noticing my daughters pizza was definitely overcooked and mine was a mess. Once I got home, I also noticed it was underdone.  Given this experience, why 2 stars? Well the taste was actually good, even with one being overdone and one underdone. I would assume this would be great pizza if it was cooked properly, but I'm not sure whether I would return if these are the normal employees. Maybe they were just weekend people, but someone needs to teach them their jobs come before changing out money in their tip jar, and if they do screw up, to not make it worse by doing a quickie \"fix\"",

I have to be honest and state I really didn't enjoy their pizza. I found the crust to taste like a breadstick and was dry. I would have preferred some fresh ingredients versus canned. I was surprised as no sun dried tomatoes or basil that I could see and I did ask. The price point was reasonable for what you get as our dinner was under $20 for two personal pizza's. A down side was that we both  ordered at the same time but my pizza came out way after my daughter's pizza did.   A fun and new place to try but I will stick to my favorite pizza place!",

    "text": "If Chipotle and pizza had a baby, Pieology would be the offspring.  This place in Downtown Summerlin offers an UNLIMITED amount of toppings in a create-your-own style thin-crust pizza.   For $8 this is a steal.  The pizza is a nice size and you will most likely have left-overs to bring home.  First, pick your sauce:  Options included the typical red sauce, 3-cheese alfredo, herb butter, olive oil, buffalo, pesto, and bbq.    I mixed some herb butter w/ the red sauce and it was delicious.  Next, it's time to pick your cheeses!  I added Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and Ricotta.  Other choices include feta and parmesan.   The employees did not skimp on the cheeses and each bite of my pizza had unique flavors due to the cheese.  The Gorgonzola cheese may be strong for some (Think bleu cheese).   The ricotta has a light and fluffy texture, mildly sweet, highly delicious.  Finally, the toppings!  There are a plethora of toppings to choose from.  Meats I saw included pepperoni, meatball, italian sausage, bacon, chicken, spicy chicken, and ham.  There were a ton of vegetable options that you normally would add to a pizza but also included options such as corn, minced garlic, artichoke, basil, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, cilantro, mushrooms, etc.  My colorful creation had italian sausage, pepperoni, and meatball (which were more like crumbled meat) along w/ minced garlic, fresh cilantro, roasted red pepper and red onions.   Unlike other Yelpers' experience here, you could see from my photos that the staff did not get stingy on the toppings.  Woohoo.   The pizza is stuck in an oven and about a minute later you're enjoying some very delicious pizza.   My 1 star deduction is for not being able to immediately find a clean table to sit at after ordering.  Every table as we walked around the generous sized location had crumbs, or empty red pepper packets on the table, or napkins/empty straw wrappers on the ground.  The other thing the restaurant could use is a larger sized menu.  They only have one posted menu the size of a travel brochure posted near the front and another one right when you order.  I could only imagine how much faster the whole process would be on busy nights if people in line could read from an oversized menu hanging above (think Chipotle) while they are waiting in line instead of having to decide once they get to the front of the line.    All-in-all, a good place to stop by when in the Summerlin area.  Definitely, a pizza joint I'll return to if I'm in the area.",

Pick your sauce and cheese BAM pick your veggies BAM pick your meats Wamm BAM thank you MAM!! As I was picking my meats I turned over to my friend and I noticed 27 people behind me!! I was holy crap I'm either higher than my uncles cholesterol or this place just got slammed!! So as I waited for my glorious pizza to be ready I got a water cup and couldn't decide if to really put water or go for the sprite fill up.... but they were hawking me for taking si long to order that I decided to go with the water before they UFC armbarred me. Finally the pizza came and boy that first bite was heaven! Everything was super fresh and delicious!",

We got sausage (tasted a little funny but was okay, I wouldn't get again), tomatoes, mushrooms, green peppers, pepperoni and olives.  The crust was thin and very light.  LOVED IT.  Service was okay.  Fast.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because of 2 things.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was only 1 person ahead of us.  And secondly, when I asked for a little extra cheese, the young woman looked at me as if I asked for a million dollars, rolled her eyes and put probably about 7 shreds of cheese onto my pie.  Bad day I guess.  Will I go back?  Absolutely!  And I must say it's something that needs to be eaten hot and fresh.  We had 2 pieces left over and when reheated, it wasn't that great.",

You pick out what type of sauce and cheese you want as well as all the toppings, and it only takes a five to ten minutes for the pizza to be brought to your table!   We both wanted different toppings and the lady who took our order was happy to make a half and half pizza for us. The 11.5\" pizza was only 8 dollars, and it tasted great! I liked the thin crust bread, it wasn't too crispy.   They have little to go boxes set up by the refreshments counter just in case you don't finish your pizza.   Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!",

With the same concept of \"Subway\" but with Pizza crust instead of sandwich bread, you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't like what you got.  They have wheat crust, which I always prefer. Both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great for Vegas.  Call me old, but I thought the music was a little louder than necessary. The to-go boxes are conveniently stacked and ready to be used right by the soda fountain machine, so you don't have to ask for one.

Much of the issues with this location are related to the clientele, which cannot be controlled. Summerlinians, you get a three for being rude.   The line is completely outrageous, which is a good and a bad thing. The location by the strip has ridiculous lines, but they move so quickly you don't notice. We waited behind 8 people for over 15 minutes. This is partly due to the staff and partly due to the patrons. The foot traffic is outstanding for this business.  Right now, there are... 15 children under 10 and around 10 teenagers. The noise level is almost unbearable, which may be because of the acoustics in here. That explains why the outdoor seating is all taken.   Also one mother has taken over the entire community table to have a pizza party for her son, I'm talking birthday cake and goody bags. So for all you families, kids are more than welcome!  The process of building my pizza was a little stressful. The young lady kept pushing my pizza to the next stage, and I realized that my pizza doesn't taste right because I have no sauce. Being rushed to go through this line doesn't help speed up the time if I keep having to tell you to bring the pizza back, add more of this (they skimp on the portions of everything), etc.   My husband confirmed that the flavors here were too bland; we eat at this place enough to know what flavors to expect. It was good, not great, but it hit the spot.  I won't come back to this location if I'm craving Pieology, but I also won't complete count it out. Next time I make my way here, I will update my review to five stars if the service is better...",

After ordering for the 5 of us, I went into the restroom to wash my hands.  It is a single toilet & urinal.  The urinal was taped off with the sign saying it was out of order.

    "text": "Think of subway had a baby with a pizza and there's the idea behind Pieology Pizza. After doing some shopping in Downtown Summerlin we just wanted something quick. We stopped by here and decided for the same price of the other pizza the best option was to just get a build your own pizza which is what my sister and mother ordered. I couldn't decide and went with the bbq chicken pizza. The sauce was too vinegary and was my least favorite of the three we ordered. Just remember toppings are unlimited so don't be afraid to ask for more. They can be kind of skimpy with certain ingredients like our version of a white pizza we made ourselves. Well they made it but you get what I'm saying. I had to ask several times for more ricotta as she out barely a few teaspoons on our pizza. I've learned also that the crust is super thin so it's best to pile on the ingredients. All in all this is a cheap option for pizza but it's been the least favorite of the places I've tried. I wasn't impressed. I think it's better for kids as a self proclaimed pizza fan I'm not a fan of Pieology it's just alright.",

The thing I love the most is the freshness of the pizza, you build it with fresh ingredients and when you taste them you can tell the difference in their pizza and the processed stuff you find in other pizza places. The restaurant is always clean, and stocked. The pizza makers bring out your hot n fresh pizza and even walk around to see if you need anything. I love the atmosphere of this place and you can't beat a 11.5 inch pizza with all the toppings your heart desires for 7.95!! There is not one negative thing I could say about this place it's that great!!",

Anyways...I went for a pizza that I thought I'd be familiar with--Smokin Buffalo Chicken and I added mushrooms, tomatoes, and basil to it. I was given a number and told that they would bring the pizza to me when done. So I find a seat after getting my cup of water and wait for my food to come. In a bout 15 minutes, my pizza came and I was a little excited for it. (I had heard all the craze about the chain and related it to my experience at Project Pie).   First disappointment: my pizza wasn't sliced! Do they not slice your pizza and just expect you to pick it up and eat it like a cookie?? I looked around at others dining in, and noticed they were eating with a knife and fork! I immediately thought, \"Seriously?!\" So I get my fork and knife and try to cut my pizza into edible pieces....  Second disappointment: the crust was so tough to cut through and the bottom was at a burnt crisp. I had to practically saw my way through the pizza to eat it! If I wasn't as hungry as I was and I could waste food, I would have upped and left!  I guess I'm spoiled by great service and food. The Chipotles and Project Pies have set the standard for quality food and customer service. I would never have gotten a burnt pizza nor would I have been expected to slice my own pizza with a plastic fork and knife at Project Pie. I'm hoping that in time, this location will live up to the standards of the chain as a whole.",

You can make your own with a very long list of toppings, and the toppings are unlimited. They have thin crust pizzas with regular, wheat, or gluten free choices, and the toppings are all top quality. Friendly staff, fast service, and holy moly was it good. My partner got a wheat crust pizza with a garlic herb brush around the outside crust, the house red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, basil, and grape tomatoes. I got a regular crust with the same two sauces, mozzarella, ricotta, spinach, artichoke hearts, black olives, and spicy sausage slices. Those may not appeal to you, but you can have them make whatever you want! None of this upcharge nonsense for more than one or two toppings, or skimping on toppings. They have a dessert pizza too, and plenty of fountain drinks and iced tea. Their pizzas are not greasy, and for once I didn't have to \"blot\" my pizza to rid it of excess oil. I was also impressed that they offer a take away box that is the perfect size for 1/2 a pie, so they are not wasting paper products either. My only notation is that it was quite chilly in there, and many people had their jackets on, but it was so worth it - we will definitely be going back soon.",

As a business owner I can see how frustrating this could be, but once the promotion was e mailed out with the particular location in it, you MUST honor it or risk making your customers very upset. This is what happened. They chose to NOT honor the promotion in which forcing me, my family, and anyone else who asks me about this restaurant to never come back.

    "text": "My experience here didn't pan out the way I'd hoped. The workers are nice but the pizza is just bad. Mine was anyway. For under $8 you can customize your pizza with unlimited toppings. They make the pizza right in front of you so you see all the toppings and such. I had a pizza with pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, and sausage. My pizza was for take out so I stood to the side with my number and waited for the pizza. While waiting other pizzas came out and a worker was using a pizza cutter to cut around the very burnt edges and another worker saw this and stopped him right away. He said the pizza was burnt and a new one would need to be made. This happened a second time while waiting for my pizza. I grew concerned my pizza would be burnt and when I opened up my pizza box my fears were right. The toppings looked good and all but the edge of the pizza was so badly burnt and the crust was way too thin. It was like someone took a large saltine cracker and put some toppings on it then burnt a majority of it. I was able to break off a lot of the burnt crust and eat the rest which wasn't that bad but nothing I'd come back for there was just nothing WOW about it.",

    "text": "Ever since I went to Irvine spectrum to try their pieology there I was obsessed with the idea of a quick pizza place styled like chipotle where you could just walk right in, pick your toppings and go. Finally we get one for Vegas! I tried their roasted veggie and had the other half styled alfredo. The alfredo had a little too much garlic and wasn't really evenly spread out but was still good, and the roasted veggie was nice and had a little sweetness thanks to the corn on top but I didn't really like how it was a little soggy and watery.. But then again you can't always have perfection. I could tell the worker also was inexperienced as well since she kept looking back and forth at the recipe instructions to see what goes on the pizza we were ordering so that might of also contributed to the unevenly spread of toppings. The flavor was over all pretty good, and the prices are pretty reasonable considering I'd pay the same price at chipotle. If you haven't been yet, I recommend going at least once. They are a newer establishment so I think i'll give them a little more time to get settled in and when they do, Ill probably try it again.",

    "text": "I honestly do not understand the positive reviews. If u are going to check out a new place in downtown summerlin, then great. If u want a good pizza, go to any grocery store and buy a frozen pizza. We waited in line for about 15 mins. It was painfully slow. One guy starts u off w your sauce. So the worker next to him waits, no one helps eachother out. It was the slowest process in the world.   The kids behind the counter just aren't restaurant workers. They are just painfully slow. The pizza came out pretty quickly. The crust is paper thin. There is an inconvenient positioning of the soda fountain. The give like 3 oz cups for water so all the water drinkers keep returning causing a huge cluster and thats right where u pay so its super congested.   The restaurant was so dirty. We sat by the window and the window sill was covered in crushed red pepper. My first bite all the toppings fells off. So i grabbed a fork at the beverage bar area. There was one left. I looked inside the container, you can see all the dirt, they must never clean it.   Luckily it was pretty cheap, but it should be cheap considering the crust is like a tortilla and the toppings are very cheap. I would imagine everything comes in frozen but I honestly dont know. They are definitely canned pineapples.   Overall, the pizza is just really poor quality. But im going against the grain according to the yelp reviews. If you want good pizza, grimaldis is pretty close, along w any gas station or supermarket would be better.",

The pizza wasn't bad but didn't exactly blow me away either (think Dominos). Oh and they have no plates, I brought my kids and we had to use take out boxes as plates. Weird. Overall, sort of a disappointment but to be fair I expected (wanted) it to be something similar to Grimaldi's closer to my house.",

The variety of toppings was quiet extensive.  They don't put a lot of each topping on the pizza. So if u are not planning on more than lets say 5 toppings, make sure u tell them to double up the toppings before sending ur pizza to the oven.  My son opted for half white and 1/2 red sauce for variety.  I got my own 1/4 pizza to decorate since I was not hungry and shared.  Everyone walked away happy;)",
