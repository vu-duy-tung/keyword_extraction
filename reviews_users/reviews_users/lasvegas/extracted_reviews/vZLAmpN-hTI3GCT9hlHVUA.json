    "text": "If I had to choose ONE restaurant in Vegas to eat at the rest of my life, THIS IS IT!   I don't want to go into too much detail because it seriously doesn't need it. From someone who is from NY and has eaten at pretty much every highly-regarded Italian spot, this is in the top tier.   The service is impeccable, the food even better and atmosphere brings you to Florence.   Strong Recommendations:  - Ceasar Salad (world's best croutons) - Veal Parm (thick, crispy with fresh mozz. One of the best I ever had) - Veal Marsala (on the bone, perfect texture on mushrooms)  - Spicy Rigatoni Vodka (it's super spicy, but the pasta is uncanny. Beautiful - Limoncello at the end to finish everything up (they left the bottle on our table, old school style).",

Linguini fungi bland and sad. Scallops way over salted (this coming from a salt lover, mind you). Wine list astronomically expensive. Small props to the grilled octopus app, which was very nicely done. The service was just ok. App came out way too early..we just barely got our bread served before the app was plunked on our table. Bottom line...we would not go back. And this experience would dissuade us from trying any of their restaurants back east. ..",

    "text": "Well....  New favorite restaurant in Vegas.   After a lackluster lunch (and crappy service) at Milos over at the Cosmo yesterday,  my wife and I celebrated her 3rd annual 29th birthday with dinner at Carbone.  From start to finish,  this was possibly the best dining service we've ever had.   We started with drinks obviously,  and my wife,  being the Ryan Gosseling fan that she is,  ordered an Old Fashioned,  which Carbone makes with an Apple Brandy. Perfectly balanced sweetness that she was looking for.   Before our appetizers arrived, they brought out several types of garlic bread with fresh chunks of the best parmesean you'll probably ever find,  along with salami   and cauliflower.   I had the lobster fra DiaVolo,  which may have been the best Lobster I've had outside of New England where I grew up. Pulled out of the shell by the captain at our table,  and topped with a tomato sauce that was just enough spice to heat it up,  and stop perfectly as you begin to taste the lobster with each bite.   My wife had the scallops,  mostly because she loves them,  but I also think we were just a little full from all the free alcohol in the casino. The scallops are massive,  and of course perfect.   Side of the most bomb mushrooms ever,  followed by banana flambe,  and we were eve brought Italian cookies and house made lemon cello that was incredible.   In all,  the bill was nowhere near as big as we expected,  which is always a bonus,  but of course that's not to say it was cheap. The service,  and entire experience just made it feel like we owed much more than we were asked by Carbone.  And that's why we'll be making this a must for every trip we make from here on.",

    "text": "I headed in with a guest that was visiting from Asia after hearing some very positive reviews from some friends. The meal started out fine enough with my order of wine and our starters. I thoroughly enjoyed the garlic bread from the bread basket, the salami, and the pickled cauliflower. However, the pizza bread was a bit soggy. We later realized we were not offered the chunk of Parmesan that our neighboring tables received.   We had an order of the baked clams which were a bit underwhelming. I think they tried to overthink things, but the clams basic clams with garlic and some lemon were the best. We had the lobster ravioli and rigatoni vodka for our pasta. It took a few times to flag down anyone to get some shaved Parmesan for our meals. They were tasty enough, but weren't mind blowing by any means.   Our server was super inattentive and when I needed another glass of what I initially ordered, he brought out something completely different. He never even came out to check on us after our entrees were served. When it came to pay the check, we did get our Italian cookie, but were not offered any limoncello or sambuca that were offered to other parties. It took way too long to process our payment.   All in all, I'm pretty sure that I won't be back... the food was okay, but the service was terrible for a high tier restaurants. They won't care since they have plenty of convention business with guys that have big expense accounts and have players that don't care about dumping their comps. Based on the lack of response by management on Yelp, I highly doubt they care about these reviews anyways.   I'd rather eat at Julian Serrano, Tetsu, Lemongrass or Javier's at Aria.",

    "text": "One of my earliest Las Vegas influences was my Aunt Ann. She had married an owner of a car dealership in Alabama and his favorite thing to do was to hit the tables in Las vegas in the mid 1960's to about 1975. A great time to be high rolling in Vegas if you ask me.  She regaled  me with stories of seeing  Sinatra at the Sands and Elvis at the International. Fine Dining was the Golden Steer and The Bacchanal room at Caesars where the \"wine goddesses\" would pour wine and massage the necks of male patrons right at the dinner table!  Many of us today want to go to Las vegas and try to find that vintage experience that sadly doesn't really exist anymore, until now. Ladies and Gentleman I give you Carbone Las Vegas...located at Aria just across from Bardot Brasserie and near the entrance of Zarkana. The original Carbone is in New York City and has another outpost in Hong Kong. On October 19th I was given a behind the scenes tour of the latest location in Las Vegas just before opening night. The restaurant is stunning to say the least and much larger than the New York branch. The bar area dining room is beautiful and clubby, done in palm fronds and blue similar to that of Bouchon at the Venetian. The Main dining room detailed in crushed red velvet and gold is simply stunning. the star of the dining room  is the over the top Murano crystal chandelier repurposed from a now defunct Ferrari dealership. The private dining rooms are elegant and inviting. As you walk in to the foyer you are greeted by three exceptionally beautiful hostesses and a large portrait of Christopher Walken behind the reservation desk. At 5:oo on opening night guest number one was your truly. I was held at the door because they couldn't  get the music to play in the dining room. The music was powered by an Aria issued iPad that didn't want to work. At 5:10 the music finally started to play. The first song was Day-O by Harry Belafonte. I was escorted to the bar as the first ceremonial bottle of champagne was popped. The bubbly was poured into a wine glass as they could not locate the champagne flutes as of yet.  My companion had a business function at the Mirage so I thought I would experience Carbone by myself, but I wasn't alone for very long as Louie Carbone, cousin of founder Mario carbon greeted me and congratulated me on being customer number one. He presented me with a china dinner plate that was hand made in Italy and  just like the ones they use in the restaurant as a memento. The food was outstanding and the service like none I have ever  had before, but had been told about by my Aunt. Table side preparation of fresh handmade buffalo Mozzarella  caesar salads, and Bananas Foster are the norm at Carbone, they can't wait to wheel a cart over to your table with some time of delightful preparation ahead. Carbone is like a scene out of Casino, The Godfather, or Goodfella's, glamorous, retro, and how the rat pack dined. The food was outstanding in every way. Dinner starts with some complimentary items that hit the table quickly. A few chunks of the best Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese I had ever tasted, a bowl of Giardiniera, imported salami and Italian bread. That's before you order anything! I started with the table side Mozzarella and prosciutto. Louis Carbone made mine fresh and hand cut the mozzarella with scissors. He hit it with some oil and  and it was heaven on a plate. The pasta course was next and it was with out a doubt the star of the show. A simple house made  Spicy Rigatoni  ala Vodka that was simply the best pasta I've  ever had. The main course was next and it was grand indeed, a bone in Veal Parmesan that is matched by no other. Terrific from the first bite and massive as it covers the plate. I was only able to get through about a quarter of it before my stomach said, enough. My usual end of meal Irish Coffee was in order but this one was presented deconstructed at the table with all of the ingredients for me to make it myself. Evidently deciding  that you are done eating at Carbone isn't an option. I was goaded in to trying the table side bananas Foster  as a must do experience at Carbone, \"Mr. Oldham, you cannot leave until you have had the Bananas Foster. I figured if I didn't get it I would be escorted to a private room in the back where my kneecaps may be pummeled. Yes, bring the dessert cart! Yes, it was better than the version that  had at Brennans in New Orleans and they invented the dish. Unfortunately two bites in I was through. Just couldn't handle another bite. You think dinner is over? It's not over until they say it's over. How about complimentary bottles of house made Grappa and Limoncello? all you can drink, they certainly know when to bring it, when you are are stuffed like a toad. They put in my record book, (yes, they keep a customer log) that I was customer number one and listed all of my likes and preferences. Pretty cool huh? Very expensive, but an over the top Vegas experience. Enjoy!",

The bread basket was soo good! It was served with picked vegetables and salami. We were shocked to find out it was complimentary and those little things can go along way. My date loved the pickled vegetables and I loved the pizza bread. Our next course was the chopped salad. There was something spicy and finally figured out it was the bell pepper! It was a welcomed surprise and it was fabulous. I wanted to take home the dressing, it was so good! Our pasta course came next. We had the spicy rigatoni and fettuccini al funghi. The portions aren't huge, as described by our waiter, but they were definitely perfect for sharing. Our entree course came next and we ordered the peppered ribs, Louie potatoes and the acorn squash. The ribs were hugeee and tender. There were only three and they laid on a bed of kale, tossed in that delicious dressing from the chopped salad. I could only eat half the rib, it was a bit too rich for me, but also extremely delicious! The Louie potatoes are where it's at!",

The interior and ambiance are extremely inviting, but it doesn't end there. The table side service was just the perfect comfort addition to the incredible array of dining creations. It is oh so Italian and \"family style\" is an understatement to how much is presented at your table. Completely rewarding if you're looking to fill your belly. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was related to the dinnerware...on 2 occasions I found dried, caked on food on a knife and then on a serving plate placed in front of me....completely disgusting knowing the plate and utensils were not clean. While the wait staff was quick to replace them, it still made me very leery of how clean the dinnerware was. Keeps me on my guard should I return for another experience.",

We literally were  the only two people at the restaurant today (at 5pm on Monday) yet she sat us at a table between women and men bathrooms. Who would even put a table between two bathrooms and two exits!? Let alone sit patrons there when the entire restaurant is empty! While I ordered some sparkling water my husband went to wash his hands, he came out with wet hands and mentioned that they didn't have any towels in the bathroom. Whoever that person is - a captain (??), the guy in the maroon jacket, looked annoyed. After I asked him if they serve carbonara (my fav Italian dish) and he rolled his eyes, we didn't want to stay there anymore, we asked for a check and left. The whole experience was unfriendly, snobbish and pretentious. There are so many great restaurants and fine dining choices in Vegas why would anybody put up with the bad service? In fact, we literally walked one minute across the hall and had an amazing dinner at Herringbone restaurant. Highly recommend! Great food, but most important -- Great Service! Smiling, friendly hostesses, attentive staff, welcoming atmosphere. Five starts service and dining for sure!!",

    "text": "To begin, I'm not usually a fan of the family style dinner; but Carbone nails it.  Unlike other Italian restaurants in Vegas where the family style screams portion sizes, Carbone's family style simply means sharing is caring.  All meals are delicious and better shared, though they are not as large as one would expect for the price.  We had a party of 5 and began with the caesar salad which was prepared in front of us.  Very good presentation to see how it's conjured up; the anchovies were a great salty addition to the salad.  Next we shared the chicken parmesan (off menu), pesto pasta, rigatoni, steak, and bass.  The rigatoni was as advertised; truly a great tasting meal, albeit small in portion size.  The steak was marinated and cooked to perfection and the chicken parmesan was perhaps the best rendition of the dish I have ever had.  The bass and pesto pasta were average.  To end we had the cheesecake, tiramisu, carrot cake, and chocolate cake and shared all.  The carrot cake was a must try.  The chocolate cake was solid but could have been more mist rather than dry.  I was disappointed in the cheesecake because as a New York restaurant I would expect the best, but this cheesecake was lemon flavored and creamy more than moist, resulting in a lemon tart-tasting dish.    Overall the meal was very good and recommended for an Italian excursion on the strip.  I would simply order and not resort to a family style type of atmosphere, personally.  The prices are high but honestly not outrageous for the strip.  They also have an outstanding Italian wine menu (though disappointing beer menu).  But if you want a great Italian meal, you can't do much better than Carbone.",

As far as Italian food goes...sorry but we Brooklynites are kind of experts. In Italian cuisine anyway. Here's the thing--if the hostess tells you to go to the bar so you can wait for your table and you wanna order a nice glass of wine, you should be able to do just that. As my client and I approach the bar we were told \"why don't you go sit over there in that area and someone will be there in a moment to help you\". Not sure why we had to \"go to that area\" but no one was there to help us. As we sat there and pondered....\"where is our wine\" our table was ready. We ordered the tortellini and spaghetti puttanesca. It's unfortunate that the bread is nothing like the seeded semolina that we covet so much in New York... but hey, we are in Vegas so...whatever. Just a tip to the management here, if you want to charge New York prices then the Quality of the service and the food has to be equally matched. Perhaps a little bartender training will improve the service.   One nice touch is the very cold limoncello we were provided at the end of our meal.   It may serve you well to take a look at what Il Mulino does in Greenwich village New York to set the standard of what we New Yorkers compare as a great Italian dining experience. Follow their lead in service and maybe I'll consider returning.   Please train your staff in how to make your customers feel welcome and then I'm happy to return!",

But don't worry, the second you walk in the vibe feels just right.  The design is awesome.. They managed to mix an old-school NY charm with the 1960's Vegas glam... And they have just the right soundtrack to match it.  The service team: 5 of 5 stars, the bar tender and the bar: 5 of 5, wine list 5 of 5, the food was obviously 5 of 5...",

Being with a group of 8, spending probably 75-80 per person and the one guy that is drinking Coke has the waiter whisper to him when he orders a refill that they aren't free is pretty tacky for a high end place. And the Coke didn't even come in a dedicated glass bottle, which at least would have been understandable.   Veal Parmesan was good, bread that is provided was very nice. Spicy rigatoni was probably the best item we ate.   All in all, Aria has better places to eat.",

Not only was it over priced for its quality (which was mediocre) it was also taken over by very large amounts of garlic. So much garlic on the Ceasar salad that everyone who ate it at the table immediately said \"Whoa, there is a lot of garlic in this!\", all you tasted was garlic.  Garlic, garlic, and then some more garlic. There is so much more to Italian cuisine than garlic but that was forgotten about at this restaurant.  Food- eh, I've had better, actually way better. Bread-Good. Service-Spotty.  Atmosphere-Depressing. Music was nauseating and very loud.",

Then we were sat at the most perfect, private, alcove table for two that are located around the dining room. Three types of bread, spicy salami, and pickled cauliflower was immediately brought to our table. Delicious.   Our servers, Joe and Eric, and the sommelier, Jason, answered every question and food and wine recommendation that we asked. Our wine was an Italian red that went perfectly with our carpaccio starter, spicy rigatoni pasta, and pork chop. Everything was outstanding.   We can't wait to come back for the cesaer salad, more spicy rigatoni, and the veal Parmesan.   We passed on desert but the desert cart looked amazing. Instead we got complementary limoncello and almond cookies.   This was the best restaurant experience we have had in a very long time. A+!!",

    "text": "There were some high points and some low points with our dinner last night. I would like to give this restaurant 3.5 stars, but in the absence of half ratings, I had to drop to 3. I could not justify a 4 star.   We walked in, and the ambience was nice. We enjoyed the decor and details of the restaurant. We had heard great things and were really excited to dine at the restaurant.   I had to drop the rating to a zero for the service. The service was absolutely appalling for a fine dining experience. First, it took about ten minutes for someone to come to our table and get our drink order. We hoped that was the only slip in our slow service.   It took about twenty minutes from there to receive the old fashion and lemon drop that were ordered. We could not find our waiter to ask on the status of the drinks and stopped someone else to inquire. We also asked if we could order our entrees, since we were now there for a half hour without being asked to place any food order. We asked for the specials and received the list of recommended dishes. We were told to think it over, and then they would come back in a few minutes to take our order.   Now 50 minutes in to being seated, no one came back to take our order, so we had to hunt down service again to try and place our order. When we finally were able to place our order, the waiter expressed concern with one of our dishes which would take about 35 minutes to prepare and wanted to make sure we would be ok with the wait. Well, it took us close to an hour just to place the order, so 35 minutes was nothing at that point!   So now the high points...  When being seated, they do bring you a nice chunk of Parmesan cheese and some salami, along with an assortment of delicious and warm breads. The bread options are a toasted sesame bread, some focaccia, and garlic bread. They also bring out some pickled vegetables. It was with these little goodies that we were able to wait over an hour and a half to get any food we ordered on our table.   We ordered the tableside Caesar salad, which was arguable the best I've had. The croutons were scrumptious, and the salad was well seasoned and dressed. The Parmesan cheese was also generously sprinkled.   We ordered the double lamb chops and the veal Parmesan. Both were good...neither were spectacular. I did enjoy the three sauce options that came with the lamp chops.   Finally, we did not order dessert but were brought some Italian cookies and an after dinner liqueur.   The special touches of the extras were a six in terms of stars. The bread basket, the Parmesan cheese, pickled vegetables, salami, and the dessert and liquor were really really nice touches. The service detracted from the overall experience. Our Caesar drove the ratings up again, but the lamb chops and veal Parmesan were about a 4.   The friends we dined with had come two weeks prior and raved about the service they had before, so maybe it was just an off night with the wrong waiter. Had our service been what we expected of this restaurant, my rating would have been between a 4 and a 5. It's worth giving it a shot in hopes that you do receive the service you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.",

After I told him that's way too pricy, his next suggestion was a $450 bottle of wine.   I wanted something around $200 a bottle but the attitude and comments made it really difficult not to order a high ticket bottle.  Especially in front of other friends and clients.  They definitely do their best to make sure the ticket is on high end side.   Very professional at doing it with finesse.   The food is average, the overall service is very professional .  The $130 steak was Really not that great.  I don't think it was seared hot enough, didn't have the crust texture.   The lobster was slightly soggy.  I would expect restaurant like this to use Sous Vide but I highly doubted due to the texture and tenderness of all the dishes.                                 I have never felt pressured of ordering expensive bottle of wine before.   The dinner bill was $1200 for 5 people.",

Whether your dressed up or in blue jeans, they will take care of you - we tried both!   The menu is designed to be an experience from start to finish where you eat your way through the menu.  We tried a couple of things, big fans of the spicy rigatoni, must have on the menu.   We also tried the octopus but shine as it probably should have, unfortunately it was paired with a peppers and onions style sauce.   The veal parm is to die for.  Sweet, tender and beyond delicious.  It doesn't come on the bone, but it comes with the bone that makes the plate.  We also had the ribeye Diana as well but again the tomatoes and slightly smoky flavor of the Diana sauce just didn't work in my mouth.  But be sure to ask about the meatballs which may or may not be on the menu.  We can't wait to try more of the pasta and maybe the veal Milanese next time. Overall this is an amazing dining experience and we plan to come back for years to come but we learned to stick to what we like, and sit back and enjoy!   Cool fact - this is place has one of the largest rum selection ever seen ranging from $10-800 in price!",

    "text": "I'm going to preface this review by saying the food was absolutely amazing, but the service has ruined all appeal for us from here on out.    My husband and I make it a point to come to Carbone every time we're in Vegas. We've been about 5 times in the past 2-3 years. So when we came to Vegas with our families for my 30th birthday, there was NO question I wanted my birthday dinner to be at Carbone!  We had a party of 12 and were sat immediately - awesome!  Our server (who I don't want to mention by name) was friendly greeting the table. He began by asking if we wanted sparkling or still water. Two options only. Well we didn't want sparkling so, still it is. $67 dollars later we realized that by not specifying tap water (despite that not being presented as an option - silly us!) they poured us Fiji water and charged per bottle. $67 of our bill was for water only. Lol.   We then started giving our drink orders. We ordered two bottles of wine before our server disappeared without taking 8/12 of our parties' drink orders. When we asked several times to place our drink orders, our server continued to blow us off stating someone else would take the order. We finally waved down Jason who was so kind and made our entire experience better (no thanks to our server) who quickly fulfilled the rest of our parties' drink orders.   As a frame of reference, our server wouldn't take the rest of our drink orders but took our food orders and our appetizers came out before the drinks.   When we started to order our food, our server explained the family style philosophy at Carbone. It sounded amazing, but we all preferred to order our own apps/entrees for ourselves. Our server then turned rude and stated \"that's not how it's done here\" and strongly urged us against ordering for ourselves stating he thinks we need to do family style. Again we explained that we all would like to order specifically for ourselves and understand. He became aggressive and made us feel inadequate for having the nerve to order what we want to eat. It was such an off putting experience everyone at the table couldn't believe we were being spoken to that way. Mind you, each couple ordered 1-2 apps/salads and an entree per person.   My sister in law ordered the Dover fish at market price. Mind you we have had Dover in the past tanging from $45-$65 on average. Carbone charged $115 for DOVER.  Completely overpriced.  The entire meal we felt as though we were taken advantage of by the staff. My husband and I would sing the Carbone praises to any/all family and friends and would encourage them to eat there while in town! Unfortunately we no longer feel comfortable recommending Carbone.   The food was wonderful - hats off to the chef. But from now on we will be going to Scarpetta where we had a wonderful service AND dining  experience where our server did not make us to feel uncomfortable, or give us attitude when we decided to opt out of family style dining.  Dishes I recommend: Rigatoni with vodka - Delicious! Beef carpaccio was wonderful Grilled octupus (phenomenal!) Love the tableside Caesar but it is spicy!",

    "text": "Maybe one of the worst \"fine dining\" experiences I've had in Vegas and I've eaten at a lot of nice places. Maybe the mistake that we made was having a dinner reservation at 9:15pm and expecting the same service as a 6:00pm reservation. We were sat 10 minutes late which is absolutely not a big deal but the hostess was slightly rude from the moment we walked in door. We were sat, waited, waited, about ten minutes of no one greeting us and no menus someone came over and asked if we had been greeted and took our drink orders, we had no menus so we just guessed at what we might like. Another gentleman came over and spoke to us, the process was confusing, I finally asked, \"Excuse me who is our waiter?\" Once that was cleared up we got menus. My only issue with the menu is that there were no descriptions so we had to ask our waitress for descriptions for everything, which I understand is a ploy to get the meal sold on the explanation given by someone who works there and not reading it- I get it. But they must also understand that it slows down the process of ya just wanting to order our food. Took about 20 mi it's to get our food.  Salad was the highlight of the meal, which speaks to the meal. Lobster ravioli was tough all around, ribs can't be marinated all day and so tough they can't be cut off the bone with a knife, meatballs were good. We were all in different rooms and wanted different checks which by the end of the night seemed to annoy our waitress. Never, not ever again will I spend that kind of money on just \"okay\" food and not good service. There are honestly too many options. Also note I still tipped 20%, because I am a believer in this <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpractice.io&s=b7d8a49500c946bfe2fccb04534e03545bdebfa8f5e9e9b6d5504ee16fcdf78f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">practice.io</a>",

Too many good Italian places where the servers add to the experience to patronize a place like this.  I should have read the Yelp reviews before booking here.",

My partner and I were celebrating our anniversary, which we informed the restaurant of well in advance. We arrived for an early dinner at 6pm, and had requested to be seated in a booth, which they had several available. Instead, we were seated at a tiny table in the corner, and no one acknowledged us for at least 10 minutes after being seated. When the waiter finally came over, he didn't even say hello, and instead said \"are you ready to order?\" At that point, we informed him that we had an 8pm show to get to and he said that wouldn't be a problem. I asked him if he could recommend a seafood dish for me that would be enough for just one person since my partner was ordering pasta and an entree for himself, and I was also ordering a salad. He suggested I go for the MP Branzino and I again asked if this was too much for one person, and he reassured me that it was fairly small, similar to the bass on the menu priced at $40. You can imagine that I was a bit shocked when an entire fish arrived to the table that would have been enough to serve 3 people. It wasn't about the money since this was a special occasion dinner, but I wish the waiter would have been honest about the portion size of the Branzino, which ended up being $130. At the end of the meal, we wanted to have dessert but we couldn't get the waiter's attention to oder it, or even clear our plates. Eventually, my partner had to get up from the table to ask the busser for the check since we had a show to get to. The waiter was nowhere to be found after he initially took our order.   We live in New York City and haven't been able to get a reservation at Carbone there, so we were very excited to celebrate our anniversary while in Vegas. We wish Carbone would have made it a better experience for us.",

It's hard to justify $130 on two entrees, even with the Parmesan, bread, limoncello and rainbow cakes. It was truly a great meal, but it is hard to enjoy when you feel guilty about the expense.",

    "text": "First time every coming to Carbone based off of a recommendation. Since it came so highly recommended, I had high expectations for dinner and thankfully it did not disappoint. We had reservations and were sat immediately.   The captain explained to us that everything comes family style and it is recommended to order from a few different areas on the menu and share. When we were deciding what to order, we just weren't in the mood for any of the \"main entrees\".  The only negative comment I have to say about the entire night/experience was that when we ordered our meal, a salad and 2 pastas. The captain looked at us funny and said \"No main entree?\" We were just in the mood for pasta.   As in most higher end restaurants you are offered a bottle of regular water, sparkling or tap. Which I personally love!   We ordered the Caesar salad to start with and share. They make it table side so you're able to customize it as much as you'd like. The only thing we opted out for were the anchovies. It was absolutely delicious! The croutons were by far the best part of the entire salad. That might sound a little odd considering they're just croutons but they're made in house and have the best flavoring to them and they're not too crunchy! Trust me, if you like Caesar salads in general you're going to LOVE this one!   I asked what were the most popular/ favorite dishes and they recommended to me the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. I think it's safe to say that I'll be dreaming about this pasta. I'm typically not a fan of any type of red sauce but this may have changed my mind. It's a red, slightly creamier sauce. The captain explained it almost like a pink sauce. It had just the right amount of vodka to where I forgot it was even in the sauce and the perfect amount of spice. I would go back just for this!   The other pasta we ordered was the Tortellini al Ragu. Homemade tortellini with ricotta and what I believe was some type of bechamel on top of the ragu sauce. This was also excellent!   Lastly to end the meal we were given a almond cookie and a shot of the lemon liquor. I will definitely be coming back.",

I walked in right when they opened and asked for a table on a Sunday evening, they claimed they were completely booked so we went to the bar. After a while I noticed that most of the restaurant was completely empty! Empty! By the time I left I they may have had four tables with customers in them. I leave it up to you but to me this is just wrong. Restaurants that want to play games like their full and want to accommodate reservations that DO NOT EXIST makes me laugh. I have a principle I believe in, \"do the right thing\" If you have a customer who is Hungary and wants to eat, accommodate him, don't send him to the bar when you can give him a table and serve him properly, pure and simple. Treat others as you would like to be treated Carbone.",

The look of the place is fantastic...You'll feel like Joe Pesci is sitting at the next table asking what makes him so funny.  Besides the beautiful decor, you'll be equally impressed with the food and service.  Nothing was left to chance, thanks to our fantastic waiter captain, Chris.   After the tasty, complimentary bread basket and salami, we started with the most amazing mozzarella, which Chris had specially done for us, as it wasn't on the menu.    Next, we shared a fantastic squash agrodolce, which is baked squash, topped with mascarpone cheese, agrodolce sauce (butter and sage based), and pumpkin seeds...not only was it magically delicious, it was also prepped table side by Chris.  The Linguine Vongole, which arrived next, had that delicious clam taste you're always hoping for, amidst perfectly cooked pasta.  For our main course, we had the 60-day, dry aged NY Strip for two, which was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of pink, resulting in delicious chew after delicious chew.  When the dessert cart parked at our table, it was hard to resist the bananas flambee, once again, prepared table side by Chris.    Just when you think things couldn't get better, the meal concluded with a complimentary bottle of limoncello and cookies.  Can't wait to return!  Carbone...the one thing in Vegas that ISN'T a gamble.",

Everything we ordered was great, but I highly recommend the meat balls, the beet salad, the fettuccine, and the roast chicken. Great place for a fancy group dinner in Vegas; not cheap, but totally worth the visit.  Cocktails and wine selection are over-the-top! If you want it, they'll have it.  We commented to our server several times about how great the music was. She mentioned that guests either love it or hate it; we loved it. Lots of classics from different decades, but everyone in our group loved it. Don't expect a quiet, intimate dinner here, Carbone is a fun, vibrant place that you'll definitely remember.  One thing I liked best about Carbone is that it's on the 2nd Floor of Aria, away from the casino, so it's a lot quieter outside the restaurant. Even though it's in the hotel this place feels far-removed from the noise of the casino downstairs.",

Our experience was subpar at best but knowing management does not value constructive criticism or acknowledge guests feedback reinforces this restaurant is not worth the hype or the price.  The veal was bland. Portion is generous but tasteless. Do not order the potato Louis. It was over salted to the point of extreme. I couldn't believe a dish like that could ever leave the kitchen of its caliber. Servers were eye-rolling each other and annoyed with one another. It was strange and uncomfortable.",

We had zupa di pesce and ribeye, both are normally good options at Italian places.  Zupa was just ok, sauce lacking complexity but edible. The steak was of really poor quality - about 40% fat and garnished with..... wait for it..... cubes of fat! Really. Who does that.  They also forgot a side of mushrooms we ordered.  I am only giving second star because we had a comp shot of house limonchello and those almond extract watermelon cookies I actually like a lot. and the comp. starter was actually descent. But the entrees were not. We left all of the steak on the plate.     Do pass, you won't miss much.",

Been here a number of times and the wait staff provides typically good service.  We sat at our table and was greeted by Troy (I think...tallish guy with salt and pepper hair) and was quite pleasant at first.  We ordered our drinks, which took forever to get.  Around 7:30 we ordered some soup and a pasta dish.  Around 8:09, Troy then turned our experience into sheer unpleasantness.  He walked up to us and said we should think about ordering our food because the kitchen is closing soon.  Wow!  What an inappropriate way to say, move on as I need to turn this table.  Right after that a number of new diners arrived.  WTH!  1 hour and you want to boot us out after two drinkks, a soup, and a pasta dish. We had planned to order our full dinner in a few minutes but weren't quite there.  Needless to say when Troy came back, we said, no thanks we aren't interested in anything else this place has to offer and moved on.  Too bad, we used to really like this place but if you don't wanted to be herded in and out like a southwest airline cattle line, DO NOT go here.  We've felt this way a bit before when we have come here but this was way over the top in poor service.  Doubt it they will ever see us dine there again.",

    "text": "Food: A NYC transplant, this was a very typical LV type restaurant in terms of overpriced. The pasta however was excellent! The rigatoni in a vodka cream sauce was succulent and it was one of the dishes that you kept wanting more. Linguine & clams was also good but not as a spectacular as the rigatoni. The spaghetti held its own and prepared aldente very simply in a tomato sauce. All the pasta were in the $28 range but as mentioned in Vegas that seems to be the going rate. For appetizers the waiter recommended the ahi sashimi style; it was nothing special. For the entrees the veal marsala was a generous cut on the bone and fork tender but the marsala was prepared in more traditional fashion so the flavor profile was different from your typical Americanized marsala. The Ribeye Diana was excellent, very juicy, and tender and the sauce complimented it really well. The Branzino which was another recommendation from the waiter, fell flat in flavor and texture; definitely not worth the $68. The dessert cart was impressive and the triple chocolate cake was more than enough to share among 4. The wine list was very overpriced and would recommend bringing your own bottle or drink in the casino before dining. It's easy to load up on the bread as the selections of garlic; focaccia and ciabatta were all very good.  Service: Service started good as the appetizers and the pasta came out quickly but there was a very long wait for the entrees which made it the dinner far longer than it had to be. Though the waiter was apologetic and said he would comp our appetizer and wine the manager did not approve it.  Ambiance: Very cool decor and there are 2 rooms which are separated by the bar and styled differently which made the noise level acceptable for conversation. With high ceilings, great colors and no real windows it felt like you were not in a casino restaurant which made it unique.",

    "text": "This is my first time eating at Carbone in Vegas, but I've been to the NY location a few times.  Carbone in NY is still my fave Italian restaurant but it can get pricey, so reserve it for special occassions.  That said, I think the quality in the Vegas location is similar but not the same.  Food: Carpaccio - definitely worth it for the table to share as a starter.  Super flavorful Rigatoni Vodka - always a must get when you go to Carbone.  This and the meatballs could be all that you order and be happy. Fettuccini Funghi - underwhelmed.  For a $30 of pasta I expected a bit more but the serving size was surprising.  Pasta was fresh but I'd rather get another rigatoni vodka. Meatballs - always must get.  I could eat all 3 meatballs and be OK. Bass Oreganta - OK, not a must have. Squash - if they have this, definitely get it.  After having the squash here, I've wanted to replicate it at home.   Ribeye - not worth $100+.  I've had this in NY and it was 2x better.  Not sure why this didn't stand up to the original but something was off.  Maybe it's that there's ton of other great steakhouses in Vegas, so coming here for steak just didn't make sense.    Overall - get a few rigatoni vodka pastas to share, some meatballs (make sure each person gets one... maybe 1.5 ;), and the squash..  Add in the carpaccio and you're good to go.  Finish off with a few cocktails, which are solid too.  Dress attire is: don't be a slob.  You can wear jeans, but wear nice ones.. not ones w/ giant logos, ripped jeans, or saggin from your knees.  It's the modern age so look proper.",

The decor/ ambiance and service make you feel like you could be in a back alley of Rome somewhere and that's without mentioning the food which tasted like it was cooked in Italy too.  There really wasn't a need for appetizers as the bread, meats and parmesan were fantastic and help to justify the high prices of Carbone. Having said that we split the baked clams of which there were 3 different types. They were all hot, steamy and mouth-wateringly good.  I followed that up with a simple tomato vodka pasta which was the perfect amount and you could really taste the freshness of the pasta. It really makes a difference when everything is made fresh from scratch and that was clearly the case here. My colleagues had the seafood pasta and ribs respectively. The latter was huge and could easily have been split between 2 or three people.  We then split a slice of carrot cake and cheesecake and I have no complaints with them either. I didn't see the check as it was expensed but I'd bet it was a high number. However, I'll go back on my own dime anytime as the whole experience is worth the money.",

I loved the little \"half shell\" booths for a romantic dinner date. However, we experienced pedestrian, forgettable Italian cuisine at nosebleed prices. Perfectly capable service but not much heart; our captain, who was very professional and knowledgeable, seemed more focused on ensuring that we ordered as many courses as possible rather than learning what we were in the mood for (*not* as many courses as possible). I would not quibble at half the price, but at $300 for two people, it was ultimately a disappointment.",

I would have rather gone to The Olive Garden (and I detest that restaurant). The best part of our meal was the bread basket. If you're forced to eat there, here are the only edible plates: spicy rigatoni, meatballs, and eggplant (if you're fine paying $85, yes, $85 for it). I'm so disappointed we took my Mom here for her birthday because I really wanted it to be special. The reviews on Yelp were so misleading! Furthermore, by 11pm, the music turned from 50s/60s to rap with F-bombs and N-bombs being dropped. Save yourself the $$$.",

I highly recommend their ribeye but make sure to order the sauce on the side as otherwise it may kill the meat taste.  Also we were nicely surprised and appreciative of the little extras they give you for free beside the main order: it started with a complementary generous piece of aged parmesan cheese, followed by a plate of charcuterie and ended with a bottle of house limoncello.  The only point they will need to work on and improve is the ice cream and gelato which are below average and were not even at the level of a regular supermarket brand ice-cream, that was a bit of a disappointment especially considering the $15 price for 3 scoops.",

    "text": "Totally loved the old school vibe of the red dining room and kinda felt like Scarface sans cocaine.  We were seated in one of the cozy booths on the outer area, which offered a great view of the beautiful center chandelier and patrons drinking their Xmas eve away with wine.    \"Prosciutto & Mozz\" was a remarkable starter with 3 cuts of cured pig (Parma, Americano and Speck), which was then topped with some amazing mozzarella sliced by our table captain.  I could have loved the tableside made \"Caesar alla ZZ\", but the bibb lettuce was too large for bites, so using a knife for salad that wasn't a wedge was annoying.  I regret not ordering another hot starter like the \"Foie Gras Veneziana\" or \"Octopus Pizzaiolo\" instead.     I knew I had to get it, but how could one not be skeptical about the famous \"Spicy Rigatoni Vodka\"??  I mean.....it's just some pasta and sauce, right?  But ho-ho-hoooo-leeee shit!  This was the highlight of the evening!!!  They somehow managed to find the perfect balance of pasta chew, sauce tanginess, and possibly some secret contraband to make this absolute heaven.  Marco Carbone should wear a gold medal at all times including when bathing or asleep.  Fuhgeddaboudit!!!  The staff pushes a 3 course dinner, but we were close to the edge of full by the time the proteins arrived.  In hindsight, sharing just one item from \"A Piacere\" or totally skipping it and going with three appetizers/pasta/split dessert would have been a better play.  Maybe even ask to see the dessert cart at the beginning of the meal to make sure you're down?    The captain bills the \"Shrimp Su'modo\" as their scampi, but the 3 huge shrimp were chargrilled, which made them a bit tough and dry.  I thought they were good, but my wife wanted a juicier, softer prawn, so she didn't like it.  I would have eaten more of that, but was way too wrapped up in my own \"Pork Chop & Peppers\".  The boneless cut was outstanding and was presented almost like a porterhouse while the center had a wonderful meaty, fatty chashu quality to it.  I would have preferred hot peppers over the sweet ones it came with, like how Rao's does it, but that's my own fault for not asking.    Seriously ready to go back now for the rigatoni alone though!  I'll be sure to have a better dinner the next time around now that I have a feel for the place.   So say good night to the bad guy!!!  3.892349092041237523 stars!!",

Last year we got the chopped salad, Caesars salad, rigatoni, and asparagus. I don't try the Caesar because of the anchovy sauce but everything else was great. We also split a lovely bottle of red wine, which was around $95-99.   This year, we tried the chopped salad, Caesar, tortellini, rigatoni, and my friends got a fish as well. They liked their fish and we loved the salad and rigatoni. The tortellini was a bit weird. It was way too stuffed with ricotta. The sauce was a tomato sauce that our server substituted and it was tasty. But the pasta was ok. Overall great dinner. Spicy rigatoni is a must. Meals also comes with bread, cheese, cookies, and limoncello. Om nom nom  Note: I took off one star for the tortellini and also because their wine prices are excessive and they have gone up since last year. My friends and I just had a bottle prior to dinner and that made the dinner more enjoyable as we were already satiated with wine and just wanted some delicious Italian food. No bottle is under like $120. Glasses are pricey, too.",

We went on a Wednesday night and he service, while a bit pompous, was attentive and honest.   We were there with a group of 6 last Friday night. Our reservations were at 630, and our group of 6 were delighted by the wonderful aroma of flowers when walking in and the delicious food.    However the food was tainted by too much salt - all the dishes including the seafood tower had specks of finishing salt (tasted and felt like maldon salt). It ruined an otherwise beautiful dish and of course we were too timid to speak up.  The waitress sold us on Dover sole as her \"favorite thing on he menu\" also quite pricey. It was our least favorite dish we ordered and did not taste fresh. We got the feeling that we were pushed to \"clear\" and item off heir shelves.   The sommelier talked us into a $120 bottle of white wine that tasted like a $10 retail white.    Overall the experience was ruined by someone on the kitchen who oversalted all our dishes (except for desert) and less than honest wait staff recommendations. At the same time, our previous experience was so phenomenal that we will return at least one more time.  Just hope that we don't Iend up with that short lady for our waitress and we won't be ordering any wine.",

We got three different pastas, the rigatoni, which they highly recommend, the tortellini and the gemelli. After that, we had the veal parm.

I explained to him what had happened and he wanted to make things right. I advised him we will never stop coming back since we love the food too much. Since that visit and yelp review, I kept in contact with Andy and advised him we will be returning soon..Well that night was tonight.   Lets just say we received the most amazing service. Not because of what had happened last time, but this was the service they have always provided which we were used to. Athena was our server who was attentive and explained to us some of the dishes. She suggested for us to try something different that we never had before so we decided on the chicken massimo. We ended up ordering the chicken, spicy rigatoni, spaghetti, meatballs and caesar salad. When the food arrived we were beyond hungry and the presentation was awesome. I never once complained about any of their dishes and today was no different. Everything was spot on and delicious. The chicken massimo smelled and tasted so good, that's going to be one of our go to dishes.   Besides the food being awesome as always, the service again was truly the high point of our dinner experience.   Andy I want to thank you for the great food and dinner experience. You went above and beyond to make our experience at Carbone a night to remember.   Athena, thank you for your service and knowledge of all the food and suggesting us to try something new.   Andy we will definitely be returning again soon and thank you again for everything!!!",

    "text": "I had higher expectations coming here. The ambiance was nice but the food was overpriced for ok quality food and mediocre service.  Our server explained that he would course out our meal and serve us at the table family style . We ordered a table side Caesar salad with no anchovies , the spicy rigatoni with vodka sauce ( which was said to be the best thing on the menu per other yelp reviews and our servers suggestion) , and the bone in rib-eye . We requested the rib eye to come with a different sauce since the sauce it originally comes with has bacon and I don't eat pig. He said the chef is very particular about the sauce and can't make it without bacon and they have no other steak sauces which we found odd. A different sever came to fill our water and we remembered the server didn't even ask us how we wanted our steak to be cooked. We requested medium plus . He was kind enough  to offer to tell the chef himself for us and we thought we would ask him about the sauces since he seemed more helpful . He came back with 3 different sauces on top of the original  steak sauce sauce but with no bacon . The steak came out medium rare , we had to send it back to get cooked more,  and we never got served at our table the way the server had originally explained to us. The infamous spicy rigatoni pasta was underwhelming , undercooked, small portion and kind of bland . The Caesar salad was my favorite of the three dishes . It was made fresh at the table , the croutons were tasty and crispy and the dressing was garlicky and spicy . Overall, I was disappointed as I was really looking forward to coming here.",

We were in town for a bachelor party and i called a couple weeks before to make the reservation.   When the waiter came over to the table he was able to easily come up with a a plan and we just ordered a couple of all the best sellers.   The parmesan was a great way to start the dinner.  House made mozzarella was excellent. And the corn with truffle is a must. Steak was cooked perfectly fish was flavorful and the veal Parm was okay, I maybe got the end of it minus the cheese but I would probably skip this on the next time.    Food was extremely flavorful, atmosphere was perfect for a guys night out on the town, and the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list.  I highly recommend stopping here while in town. And will definitely be back!",

First, it is perfect seating for couples with cute two person half circle booths. They start you off with complimentary cheese, prosciutto, and amazing bread. We had the Caesar salad, vodka sauce pasta, and the bass - everything was amazing.  Even better than the food was the service. Our captain knew everything about the dishes and took her time explaining them to us. Our courses were perfectly timed.  My only note that is a little less than positive is that the wine is expensive. The cheapest bottle on the list is ~$80 but most are $150+ - I would have liked some more options in the $60-$80 range.  Overall, can't recommend enough for a date night!",

    "text": "I am so upset that I feel strongly enough to write this review.  I have spent this day after my visit to Carbone with a deep sense of regret. I have had many expensive meals on the Las Vegas strip, and this experience was my absolute least favorite of them all.   I visited Carbone last night with a large group. Our reservation was for 9:00pm, and the table was not ready until around 9:30pm. I understand that these things happen, however this is still not a great experience for the prices restaurants like Carbone charge; we were all very hungry.    After we were seated, I felt like we were spending a longer-than-normal amount of time waiting for different stages of this meal.  We waited a long time to have our food order taken, and even longer to have a drink order taken.  They did not take our drink order before they took our food order, which many were annoyed by.   Witnessing the waiter explain the process of ordering was the most intolerable experience of the night.  We were all incredibly confused by his description of how the eating experience was supposed to work, which was only confounded by the fact that some at the table were budget-conscious and would've liked to have known exactly what they were paying for.  I understand how a family-style experience works, and Carbone's menu was just not organized to indicate this was how it was going to work.  A majority of the members in our party indicated that they were intending to eat portions just for themselves, but the waiter CONTINUOUSLY overlooked these clues.  One of our party members had to ask the waiter MULTIPLE (3 or 4) times as he went around the table whether or not he was ordering for himself and his date, or if the plate he just ordered would be shared.  The waiter's responses were consistent misdirections, which made me feel like he just wasn't getting it. He wasn't getting that we just wanted to order our own plates and eat our own plates and if we weren't allowed to do that, he was not CLEARLY explaining how it would work and how the dishes would be charged otherwise.  We all work in luxury service and we are not a difficult bunch, but the waiter paid no attention to addressing our concerns and could've made a much better effort to understand us and explain the process more clearly. The prices for some of the dishes (because of the shared plates) were priced differently on the menu than they were on the bill, and we would've known this and probably declined to order them if this had been CLEARLY explained to us.   The worst part: The waiter came to my dear friend last and she expressed she wanted to order an item off of the \"Macaroni\" portion of the menu. The waiter declined to write down her order, stating \"we already have the starters and salads off of that side of the menu, we're really looking for entrees now.\" She responded, \"oh really? I don't really want an entree though.\" The waiter then rephrased the same statement, which made my friend feel pressured into ordering a dish she really didn't want.  A customer should NEVER feel pressured into making a purchase in a luxury environment.  This is a terrible business practice, and I hope that this shortcoming is not due to the training program of your establishment, and is ONLY due to the lack of communication skills of your wait staff.  We spent most of our meal regretting the things we'd ordered, feeling underwhelmed by the entrees and the service most of all. I spent about $50 more than I had intended to because I was served things I did not order. And as a customer, you get so frustrated that you angrily hand over your credit card and resolve to leave a Yelp! review about it later (I am not proud of this).   Not to mention that we spent 4 hours there from start-to-finish because the whole process was drug out to death. I was DYING to leave by the end.   My BIGGEST POINT (TL;DR):  For a $1000 experience, any single member of the wait staff should be able to clearly communicate the dining experience, and should have enough interpersonal skills to really be able to connect with and address the concerns of the diner; at no point should a customer be pressured into ordering a dish they do not want because the communication is so poor that they start to believe maybe they're just not getting it and should just go with the flow.  Absolutely awful and sad.  I will not go back.",

Upbeat exciting music that almost makes you want to dance.  When you are seated, you are immediately greeted and provided several very nice starters.  Delicious Breads, Spicy Salami, Pickled Cauliflower (try it) and  what I assume is extremely aged Parmesan cheese.  These items alone deserve 5 stars.  You have a waiter and a captain who explains the restaurant and menu to you.  We decided to order the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer and man...it was incredible.  They literally make the mozzarella to order.  It comes out hot and they cut it into pieces infront of you placing it on the prosciutto.  SOOOOOOO good.  We followed the appetizer with a single order of the veal parmesan.  Holy crap.  Top 2 veal parmesan's I've ever had.  The veal has a light crispy parmesan crust covering the entire veal and an absolutely delicious marinara sauce to go with it.  The waiter cuts the veal into 4 pieces and serves it to you.  Amazing.  Oh yeah, the drinks - I am a rum fan.  HUGE rum menu.  Even better - staff that knows and understands the rum.  My waiter talked to me for 5 minutes about the rum telling me the different options and what he thought I would like based on my preferences.  When they bring you the rum, they cart over a good sized round table with all of the rum choices on it, hand you the bottle to confirm your choice and then pour your drink.  Very unique and excellent.  By the end of the meal we were actually pretty full, and while we wanted to try a dessert, couldn't manage.  All of them looked amazing though.  The top off the night by providing you with a complimentary bottle of homemade limoncello and an Italian cookie.  You obviously can't take the bottle, but you can sit there as long as you want to sip on the final drinks of the night.  10/5 stars.  Can't wait to come back.  My wife and I can't stop thinking about Carbone.  Open up a store in North TX!!  PLEASE!!",

For the meal, we had the spicy rigatoni (they were not shy about the spicy) and veal parmigiana. The veal was cooked perfectly. Also had a couple of meatballs which were delicious.   Dessert. They banana flambe was very good. However, the Nutella tiramisu was not. I am not sure what the chef was thinking in making this dessert but it was not good. If you eat at Carbone, trust me when I tell you to skip the Nutella tiramisu.   Other than the Nutella disaster, I highly recommend this place.

The restaurant is dimly lit and it's almost as if you're dining inside an up-scale yet cozy Italian home. You will feel like you've been plopped into the scene from beauty and the beast when Belle is sitting at the dining table being served by the hospitable staff. Perfect ambience for a romantic date or a girls' night out. The bread basket here is amazing. There are so many different types (super soft sesame bread, garlic bread, pizza like bread). They also provide fresh cheddar that they grate in front of you straight from the block. Guess what else they give you for free? Salami and pickled cauliflower. What else?! Marzipan dessert and a bottle of limoncello!! So yeah this place is pricy but if you take into account how much you're getting on the house, it's really a pretty good deal! The pasta is so fresh and rich!! No complaints about the main entrees. The one negative comment for this place would be their Nutella tiramisu. It tasted more like a cinnamon crepe cake than tiramisu. I could barely taste the Nutella. But based off the other aspects of the restaurant, I'm willing to try other desserts next time!",

    "text": "After dining at Carbine in NYC the only thing I was not thrilled about was the amount of space you are afforded or should I say lack there of.    Carbone at Aria is the exact opposite. Same amazing food with plenty of space to relax and enjoy the experience.   The meal starts with complimentary spicy salami, Parmesan cheese and pickled cauliflower.  All tasty to nibble on while waiting for dinner.   We had the meatballs which were fantastic.  I would have to say best ever, even if it is something that usually doesn't stand out for me.  My cousin and I agreed this was one of the best dishes from an entire weekend in Vegas after eating at some very good restaurants. The grilled octopus was delicious.  I love the lobster raviolis.  We had the scallops and shrimp in the saffron butter sauce.  I thought ever dish was good and enjoyed the meal thoroughly.    Beautiful bar and dining rooms as well.   Will be back time and time again without question.",

    "text": "Fine dining at its best.  My boyfriend and I were staying at Aria and wanted to try Carbone because the pictures looked amazing on our friend's SNS. We tried to make reservations for Friday night on Friday afternoon and it was booked so we decided to make reservations on Saturday instead.   Service is superb. Complimentary bread, pickled cauliflower, and spicy salami when you get seated. They also come around with a cheese block for fresh Parmesan. I decided on the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka because Yelp said so ;) and because I was ready to devour carb after a week of salad diet. My boyfriend got the rack of lamb, this dish is MP but I believe it came out to be around $85. PRICY but seriously the best lamb dish I ever had. We also got a side of asparagus. All of the dishes were amazing. Seasoned to perfection. Rigatoni sauce on point. The portions are not huge but sized right. We were definitely full afterwards and no room for dessert.   We were about to leave the table but one of the servers came by and told us to wait for the complimentary lemon liquor and italian cookies! The lemon liquor was so strong, the server said it was 100% proof.",

Upon settling into our table, I scanned the place....and re-scanned.  \"Wow\" I thought.....there had been significant thought and effort put into the aesthetics and ambiance. Every...effing....detail...was carefully considered.  Custom rolling serving carts with marble tops. Vintage chairs re-upholstered. THAT chandelier.  THAT Walken canvas behind the hostess stand.  Ask your server for details. It is a design museum.   Carbone passed the bread test.  Y'know, \"bread and bathrooms\".....my litmus test for whether a restaurant sweats the details.  Now bring on the goods!  Carpaccio was light and delicate.  Unique flavour.  Glad that I tried it, but probably wouldn't order it again.  Rigatoni and Meatball....Check!  Veal parm....Check!  That Squash.....I will return simply to have a plate of that squash.  I'm dreaming of recreating it for my wife when I return home.  And guys.....thanks for leaving the whole bottle of limoncello....nice touch.  My wife and I have a trip to NYC planned soon.....perhaps an excursion to Carbone in NYC is on the agenda?",

Well duh, especially when they are charging the prices they do they better treat ya like royalty. I was seated in a huge booth and the restaurant had a \"Scarface\" feel to it aka in one of the scenes where he is cussing his wife out and the whole crowd inside the restaurant lol. Extreme Italian vibes. Meats, cheeses, and pickles were brought upon arrival instead of the traditional bread and butter which was pretty awesome. I ordered my basic 'Long Island' drink which had just the right amount of alcohol and more which I totally appreciate. I felt kinda tipsy on the first drink. Don't you hate when you go out and can barely get alcohol in a drink so you spend way extra than needed just to feel that good buzz?   My friend was urging me to try octopus for the first time as I have always vowed to never try it but I gave it a shot and it was delicious. It was smoked and grilled and had a rich red wine flavoring to it. My friend and I ended up ordering the lamb rack special & I went for the basic angel hair and meatballs. Both were extremely delicious and we had plenty of food to take with us. It made the perfect late night meal after a night of clubbing. Service was great!! I have zero complaints! Give this place a shot you won't regret it",

    "text": "Disappointing Visit This Time  Our reservation was at 8:45p for 9 ppl.   We were seated in the bar area of the restaurant about five minutes past our reservation time.  Which was fine.  It was a Friday night and kind of busy, though there were open seats at the bar.  I've been to Carbone on many occasions, as have others in our group.  We've always had an excellent experience.  The cocktail waiter who was serving us in the bar happened to come by our table and since our waiter was nowhere in sight, we order drinks from him again.  Finally, our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later and gave us this long monologue about the food & the experience.  I really thought he was going to be very attentive based on our initial meeting with him.  Well, that started to go down in flames shortly thereafter.    He finally came back to take out order.  I mentioned that we wanted the ceasar  salad & the spicy rigatoni for the table, them everyone would add additional items based on their preference.  We ordered a few other things and then the waiter TOLD us that wasn't enough and what we needed to order.  Didn't ask, but TOLD us.  At this point, we also finally received bread & pickled veggies.    Sometime after 930p, we finally had our ceasar salad (1st course) being prepared for us.   We ordered addl drinks at this time as well.  Drinks were finally delivered almost 25 min later and finally almost an hour after the salad, the pasta course was served.   This was almost two hours later we had just received our pasta course.  Our waiter appeared to have one or two other tables, so certainly not overwhelmed with tables.  He NEVER checked on us...the only time we saw him was when we were flagging him down to ask a question, inquire about our drinks, food, etc.    In all of my visits to Carbone, the waitstaff has been VERY attentive and ALWAYS available.  This is what always brings me back to this place.  Well, after being there for almost two hours and no main course, we told him to cancel everything.  It was a very disappointing experience at that point.  He made up a million excuses about how he was giving us extra time during courses and he couldn't cancel anything at that time and then said we could speak to the manager.  At which point we said yes, we'd like that, he never brought a manager over to our table until we asked where's the manager that you said we could speak with?  Then all of a sudden, he's bringing out our meals...funny how the simplest courses took two hours but then once we ask to cancel the rest of our order, its ready in less than five minutes.  Then he started spilling out stories about how he wanted us to experience the dinner, for no charge, trying to makeup for his earlier shortcomings.  Something was clearly off with the kitchen or our waiter that evening.  A manager finally did come to the table and we did explain the overall experience and our disappointment overall.  She also tried to get us to accept the meal, on them, but at this point, our evening has already been ruined.    I do appreciate that the manager did her best to resolve the situation, and for that, the next time I'm in LV, I will go to Carbone again.  But in the future, if there is something wrong in the kitchen, please, as a waiter, do not try to cover it up and disappear from your guests.  You should be keeping them in the loop about whatever the situation may be.   And to top it all off, as we were walking out, we realized, we never got our fresh Parmesan cheese.",

Another party walked in without a reservation and were  immediately seated in one of the coveted opera booths.  Us?- we were seated at a table for two, next to a plant, in the corner next to the entry  to the kitchen.  The rest of the restaurant was empty.  But okay.  Clearly this couple knew someone there which became even more evident observing our waiters nonstop conversation with them the entire time we were there which resulted in minimal attention to us. The ceasar salad was excellent.  The rest of the food mediocre.  For $222 spent on veal parmasean and some balsamic chicken dish, we were expecting more.  .  The musiv was way too loud and the place was also way too dark.   Too bad. We visit vegas every year.",

    "text": "If I could make it a half a star I would. It is truly one of the worst restaurants I have ever experienced. The food was passable, barely, and incredibly overpriced.  The best way to describe the food was that it was all just plain bland, as if someone had stole the spice rack right out of the kitchen. There really is no excuse for being charged $85 for dried out eggplant parmigiana, $89 for under seasoned under cooked four tough lamb chops. $38 for water (which came as a complete surprise).  And when we ordered a Caesar salad the waiter doubled up the order without telling us, charging $44 instead of $22.  The pasta, as my Italian father would say, it was \"uninspired and without soul.\"  I've been to Italy several times and believe me this is not it. The waiters and the staff seemed to be uninformed about the dishes and rushed to get our orders, impatient when we asked questions. What does family style truly mean? I believe it is just an excuse to double up your charges.  We came here for my wife's birthday. At the end of the dinner she got sick at the table and threw up filling up three of those nine dollar water glasses. Where was the wait staff?  Not one person came over to us and asked if we needed any help.  The dinner was truly a disappointment (to put it mildly).  If you're into being overcharged and underserved this is definitely a place for you.",

Upon entering, the service was great. We were seated quickly (we went early) and we received service immediately. While waiting for our drinks (which was not long at all) I surveyed the room. Every single employee was dressed beautifully. The restaurant itself was elegant. With our drinks, the waiter brought us a bread basket with assorted breads, spicy salami , marinated cauliflower and a freshly cut wedge of Parmesan cheese from which he sliced from a HUGE round wheel of cheese. Just the appetizers alone were filling and delicious!! For our entrees, we decided to try:   Sizzling Pancetta Spicy Rigatoni Vodka Bone-in New York Strip Grilled Asparagus   Each selection was served one at a time with the exception of the NY Strip & asparagus. So delicious and so filling! We weren't sure we had enough room for dessert but, hey, we were there to indulge. So, we ordered the Chocolate Cake with Nutella Ice Cream. Delicious!  Just when we thought we would need to literally \"roll out of there\" the waiter then brought us some almond cookies with Limoncello!! The food was never ending!! Everything was excellent!   The service was SUPERB!! They didn't miss a beat. They were always on it! Very friendly, very professional.   We have recommended this place to all of our friends and family and we will no doubt return!",

    "text": "Located in the Aria Resort, it was fairly easy to find. So that's a plus if you have been walking around or gaming all day and need to relax with a fancy meal. And before I get into depth about the food that we ate, I will start with this. The restaurant is gorgeous. An artsy canvas of Christopher Walken invites you at the lobby and you are taken into a luxurious blue dining area area and past that, lo and behold, the lush red room with twinkling chandeliers comes into view as you pass full carts of desserts, liquors, and cheese. It's beautiful. Now, sitting at the table, Sinatra blaring from the speakers, you are given quick pickles (delicious!) and a basket of bread. The bread basket is probably my favorite part of the restaurant. It has garlic bread, focaccia and one other kind (that I don't remember ) with a small chunk of parmesan cheese. It's yum.  The menu is brought to you, and there's very little written on them but dang, those are some large menus.   Anyway. We were planning on eating something later in the night so we decided to skip a large meal and we decided on lighter dishes. We decided to go with the Octopus Pizzaiolo - an aged grilled Octopus. It was really soft and not at all chewy which was an interesting texture. It was alright. Next, we split an order of the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka, their most suggested menu for their pasta. Ours were slightly undercooked for my taste and the sauce was very zesty salty. It was good. Not great, but it was alright. But were both dishes worth +$25, um... no. The ambience was ok but the tables for smaller parties were all stuck together and it wasn't the most spectacular experience. Lastly, with the check comes a few slices of the marzipan rainbow cookies.   The price is unavoidable because it is Vegas but it's a shame that it was such a lackluster dining experience. Because -  the restaurant was so beautiful. I just wish it had been a more memorable experience. The cliche music kind of kills the authentic vibe and the cuisine.",

    "text": "I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:  Double order of Caesar salad Assorted baked clams Foie gras Fettuccini con funghi Spicy rigatoni vodka Spaghetti Julien Meatballs Veal parmesan  Chicken Scarpariello Lasagna verde Bananas flambee Carrot cake  We were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.    After ordering, it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad, the foie gras, the spaghetti Julien, and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However, there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.  The poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish, however, was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said, \"This doesn't taste good.\"  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones, however.  The room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.    From the 45 minute wait, one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.  Two of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.    Having spent $100 including tip, I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!",

    "text": "Firstly, forgive me -- I am but an In-N-Out connoisseur. Carbone & its offerings are a tad outside my usual price range.  That said: THIS PLACE IS FIVE-STAR  From the dark, brooding ambience of the 'red room', to the impeccable service & the food-- my god, the food...Carbone was an A-level experience.  Listen, I'm keeping this simple. I had the white fish special ($86) - I call it 'white fish' because I can't remember the name. A+ Yelper right here, y'all.   I began my meal with some 'mini- Scottish Lobster' scampi. Once again: don't remember the actual name. It was $64 though & delectable. There were three. That averages out to about $21.50 for each mini lobster.  I could've bought, like, three halibut steaks at whole foods for that price. But I won at blackjack earlier in the night, so I ordered the Scottish mini-lobsters. Don't regret it.  In all seriousness, Carbone has everything I look for in an upscale establishment:  stellar, unique food, outstanding service & character/ambiance.   The ridiculous bread basket & parmigiano wheel were a personal highlight.",

    "text": "Phenomenal culinary experience!  Italian food can be hard to break any barriers because the nature of it values old school tradition. However, Carbone has managed to bring Italian dining into the 21st century without disrespecting the integrity of it. Its a hybrid dining experience. The serving vessels themselves remind you of Grandma Nonnas but the food is reinvented and served with the most high quality wait staff you could ever dream of, some even being prepared table side that almost conjures a hibachi type dining experience.  I've eaten here three times now and Deon (Dion?) was the most talented waiter I have ever had in my life. His passion for the food, the branding, his colleagues was obvious and translated to his talent of executing a very memorable dining experience .  Order the spicy rigatoni paired with the meatballs (off menu item), if you want to kick it up a notch, ask for the chili oil to make the rigatoni THAT MUCH BETTER IF THATS EVEN POSSIBLE!!   The wine list is thoroughly divine as well, pricy, but fantastic selection.",

We had 3 meals at the table.  Veal parm, lobster ravioli, and chicken dish.  Veal parm was to die for and real must be ordered.  Lobster ravioli was also very tasty and portion was perfect.  The bread, parmesean reggiano as an open was also a nice touch.  Complimentary lemoncello followed dinner....really wish they didnt forget appetizer but the food portions made up for it.

Last night decided to take my dad for the first time after all the raving I had done and it was pure disappointing. After waiting over two hours, when we were told one hour and half even being in the system, I was the one calling to check if the tables ready...I called around 945 finally she's like oh okay it's been ready...I said well  no one called. This was probably because it was close to closing they weren't even going to call me realistically but that's not an excuse. So second off, Our waiter was so unwelcoming and didn't explain anything, mid convo he would walk away and didn't show up until the end for us to pay. He rudely gave us a bill which you're paying an arm and leg for you should be nice about. He didn't want to explain any dish my dad was asking about, he would give him a dumb rude stare...it was just not okay. Paid $110 for a small fish and well I got my usual spicy rigatoni which was not even hot but couldn't find the waiter to let him know. Overall, I'm sad to say they lost my consistent business after many years of bringing new people. Oh, on the receipt the cashier name is \"Joe\" which sounds about right. You can thank him.",

    "text": "First experience: My fiance and I are huge foodies and are originally from New York. In New York, you have to book at least a month in advance to get a reservation. We were ecstatic to hear that we could easily make a reservation at the Las Vegas location. We couldn't wait to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, we didn't have the best service. It took over 45 minutes for us to get our baked clams. Kindly, they provided us with a complimentary dessert to make up for our poor experience.  Second experience: Last weekend, my family came into town and were eager to try Carbone. Previously being a server, I understand that restaurants sometimes have off nights - so we figured we'd give it a second chance. We made the reservation and were hoping to have a wonderful Italian experience!  The service was much better this time but the food was far from anything special. My fiance ordered the New York strip, which was highly recommended by our server. He insisted that it was \"pure perfection.\" For $135 (no sides included), it was far from perfection. We ordered a wide selection of entrees and everyone was less than impressed. The only part we truly enjoyed was the bread. Overall, it was overpriced and overrated.",

    "text": "Vegas has a lot of great italian restaurants, but when you're in Carbone, it takes you away to somewhere you've never been before.  It takes you to back in the day- rat pack era. I honestly felt like I was in New York (especially after a few rounds of drinks). Elegant captains dressed in red/burgundy tuxedos with bow ties, they do a tremendous job at making everyone feel like a VIP.  The restaurant has two different dining rooms: the first is a more casual theme with blue and white tile and surrounds the bar area. Further inside is the \"Red room\" with a gorgeous chandelier and romantic, cozy booths- the absolute perfect place for a date night with loud classics playing over the speakers.  Some highlights of the meal were: Caesar Salad (The croutons were incredible) Spicy Rigatoni Vodka Veal Parmesan  Tortellini with Black Truffle shaved by the Executive Chef himself- Quite the unforgettable experience Banana Foster (Cooked in front of you)  It's not just a dinner- it's an experience. Allow yourself a good amount of time to really relax and enjoy. The service is impeccable and trust in your Captain and the staff, from the hostesses to the management and complete wait staff, these people will take care of you like their own.  And yes, when people say its pricey, they're not lying. But if you're willing to spend the money for delicious food and a memorable experience, it's worth every penny.",

The pork chop peppers was cooked to perfection, red in the middle tender crispy on the outside.  We ordered two pastas, loobster and spicy rigatoni.  Both came out al dente and perfect.  the lobster raviolis isn't something I enjoy as much but you have to appreciate the way it's cooked here.  I'd say Go for entree first as thats really the thing to go for and the portions are big and add the sides, pastas if you need fillers.  We ended up being full on the fillers and when the delicious pork came out we were already full!    the comp bread they give you and salami and cheese is pretty good too.   Best memorable birthday ever and all thanks to my wonderful wife who I'm just in love with.   Thank you.",

Essentially it was vegetable broth they poured over elbow noodles and garbanzo beans. I sent it back, I can make that at home myself (though I never would because no flavor) asked for the Caesar salad instead. They brought that out made tableside, and meh it was alright. I think the best part was the croutons. Next for the tortellini ragu, same thing everything needs umpf. Ask for the scampi alla scampi typically made with langostines but they were out so had two Madagascar shrimp which were huge and cooked well. But needed maybe more garlic or something in the sauce.

    "text": "Everything is quite delicious. Looking for a nice Italian dinner? Come here! I'm not the ultimate fan of Italian, but I def enjoyed this meal.  The complimentary bread basket was delightful, with some Semolina, garlic bread, focaccia. The pickled cauliflower and salami were also fab. Usually not a parmesan person either (wow what's wrong with me, huh?) but this parmesan was outta this world. Loved it.   To start off after our complimentary goodies, we gave the caesar salad and chopped salad a shot. Both salads were delicious, caesar salad was probably top 5 of all the caesar salads I've had. In-house-made croutons & the dressing though, top notch. The chopped salad was tasty, but caesar salad if you have to choose one!  Of course we tried the Spicy Rigatoni which was everybody's favorite. Perfect spice kick (don't expect extreme spice, merely for flavor) and the overall flavor was en pointe, apparently everyone tries this and it's highly recommended. I also enjoyed the Lobster Ravioli in squid ink pasta, generous chunks of lobster.   As for dessert, we had the table side Banana Fosters which was delicious for a non-dessert person, everything about it was enjoyable from the table-side-prep to the heavily infused liquer, maybe a bit too strong. Also tried the Tiramisu, not too bad, texture or flavor a bit different than the usual Tiramisu I am used to, can't pinpoint it. We also got rainbow cookie/cake which was uber sweet but flavorful.   Finished off with some strong arse limoncello. Every sip was a struggle because I was so full. You definitely get what you pay for in quality, not quantity. Enjoy!",

The entire decor and ambiance drools retro chic while the food stays True to its roots in flavor but gets dressed up  Meatballs (4.5/5) - off menu but some of the best I've had at a restaurant. I'd argue they were better than Rao's by far  Caesar salad (4/5) - one of the best Caesars I've had. It's also done table side  Lobster ravioli (4.5/5) - delicious and an abundance of lobster pieces   Veal parmigiana (4/5) - tender and elegant. This is where Rao's has an edge.  The free nibbles at the beginning and the end help out this place over the top though. Service is great and wine selection was nice too. I'd be happy to go back.",

Carbone is in Aria and we were fortunate to sit in the cutest little booth. It looked out to a gorgeous chandelier and the rest of the floor.  What we ordered: Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and Gnocchi.  The meal came with bread, cheese, and salami. A nice starter, but don't eat too much or you'll ruin your meal!  The Rigatoni was delicious and lightly spicy. I really enjoyed it. It wasn't too heavy and was a nice portion. I split this with my coworkers Gnocchi. Holy cow, the Gnocchi was amazing. Like perfect little pillows. It came with perfectly cooked asparagus. If the Gnocchi is on the menu, definitely order it. If it's not, go for the rigatoni. You can't lose.  I know you're supposed to go through the entire meal, but honestly that was enough for me. We did order dessert, but we barely touched it. It was the Nutella tiramisu and honestly...pass on it. You can find much better desserts elsewhere. They also provided us with limoncello which was a nice touch.  Overall I really liked the food, but the service was meh. Once a table of six came in we were basically on our own. There were plenty of times when I didn't have my water refilled and it took forever to get the bill.  I'd recommend it from a food perspective, but not so much because of the service.",

I felt like i was in a scene from Goodfellas.  I called ahead to request one of the red booths for my party of 3 and they were able to accomodate.  For starters they bring out a really good bread basket and some salami.  We also ordered the chopped salad which was ok.  Next we got 3 pasta dishes.  The lobster ravioli, tortellini ragu, and spicy rigatoni vodka.  All were amazing.  Next we got the chicken massimo and potatoes louie, which was the best side dish I've ever had.  The portions appear to be small, but they definitely filled us up.  The server was also excellent, our waiter gave good and honest reccomendations.  I would definitely reccommend carbone for an amazing all around experience",

And it was an incredibly small portion. two salads was smaller than a typical one person serving for a dinner salad. And each serving of the salad was $28! Absolutely not worth it.",

I think that Carbone is a must but not somewhere you have to eat every time in Vegas. The service is impeccable and the food is amazing. The only reason that I didn't give this place 5 stars is due to the server. We had the same woman both times (diff year) and each time we encouraged her to just bring whatever she thought was best! Obviously we weren't on a budget yet I felt she was looking out more to up our tab rather than cater to our palates. I would go back for sure as the experience is amazing.",

Let me try to make this experience helpful but brief: I was with a group of 4 gals and the options below were more than enough, keeping in mind that 2 of us were starving and 2 were not hungry at all. Total was in the high $300s. We received the complimentary basket of various breads along with a small plate of thin meat slices, and one of pickled cauliflower. The cart with a deli-sized parmesan (or gouda?) cheese comes around to add to the breads.  ANTIPASTI - Octopus Pizzaiolo: The octopus was fully cooked and very tender. Mixed with bell peppers and onions, it was a perfect fist entree INSALATE - Caesar alla zz: The ingredients are rolled and mixed on the cart by your server. I love Caesar dressing when made from real anchovies... but this became my favorite! The croutons were huge but immediately melted in my mouth. Perfect amount of cheese dressing MACARONI - Spicy rigatoni vodka: This pasta is made from scratch, and this dish did not dissatisfy. We ended up scrapping any leftover sauce with the bread  PESCI - Whole branzino: The fish was fresh and tasted great, although surprised by the serving size (I thought a whole branzino was bigger). Came with 3 dipping sauces although a squeeze of lemon was sufficient and did not mask the flavor. Note no sides and market prize CARNI - Meatballs: Note not on the menu but was highly recommended by a friend. Boy was it for a reason. The tomato sauce and 3 large meatballs were just perfect. CONTORNI - Potatoes Louie: Can't go wrong with potatoes as they were delicious and portion larger than expected. Went well with the branzino. - Asparagus: Note not on the menu but recommended by the server.  WINE - The book for bottles and half bottles is huge. Categorized by wine type and region, it was a little overwhelming. Luckily, we had someone from the bar come over and help us narrow down our options (per the notes, acidity, and price range). From what I could see, prices ranged from $100-1600.  SERVICE - Between the 1) server, 2) the gentleman who helped us pick our wine and 3) the gentleman who rolled in the cheese, provided recommendations, and rolled in the dessert cart... service could not have been any better! Towards the end of our dinner it got a bit busier (our reservations were for 5 pm) and they were still checking in on us (not obnoxiously) and were so accommodating! Ended our dinner with complimentary cake and freshly-made limoncello! Came back 2 days later and can't wait to do the same next time I visit Vegas.",

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.   They bring bread to the table. There's 3 different kinds of bread in the basket. Then they come over w/ a cheese block and shaving off as much as you like. We listened to our captain like we were watching a movie of food goodness.   We settled on OCTOPUS PIZZAIOLO. We love getting octopus anywhere we go. Octopus is always hit or miss. Carbone was a hit. Nice and tender.  LOBSTER RAVIOLI is what I had for dinner. A-MAZING! Every bite of these fluffy little pillows was like heaven. Sometimes the sauce is can be too much after so many bites. Not here, I devoured my food as if I hadn't eaten in days.   The food is solid. However the plates they come on may be chipped. I'm guessing this is by design of the restaurant, but nobody wants that little extra in your food. Right?",

    "text": "I was looking for a good Italian restaurant nearby and stumbled upon Carbone on yelp. It looked good enough so I  decided to give it a try. Once I arrived though I knew this was not going to be just a regular dinner.   From the moment you step into the restaurant you can tell that everyone cares tremendously about the restaurant and the experience. We first sat at the bar waiting for our table. The bartender was nice and helped us lol over the menu. The barback chatted with us for a while and helped us look over the food menu as well. When she noticed we had been waiting for a while she took it upon herself to check with the hostess about our table. Apparently the hostess said she didn't have our contact info. The barback didn't even need to do that but it was so sweet and thoughtful of her, without her we might not ever have gotten to our meal!   Ok so now we are seated in a cozy little booth inside the main dining area. Now when I picture fine dining this restaurant is exactly what I envision. From the giant chandelier to the red velvet booths this place was beyond beautiful. Our server, Dion, truly made the experience one of a kind! The way he described each item on the menu, it was hard not to want to order every single thing on the menu! They started us out with bread, salami, and pickled cauliflower all of which were super delicious. Please if you come to this restaurant do yourself a favor and order the spicy rigatoni, it is to die for! And the lamb chops? Honestly I would never ever dream of ordering lamb chops but they were seriously delicious. Zero hint of that lamby flavor that you get when eating your ordinary lamb. They cut and plate your double lamb chop table side which it a nice touch as well.   Overall you do not want to miss a chance to experience this restaurant. Please do yourself a favor and visit Carbone ASAP!",

The menu is huge ( just the size of the menu, unfortunately when you open this giant menu, there's only 20 menu items listed).   I ordered the linguini and clams. There was so much pepper in the dish that you couldn't really taste it. That was too distracting.   The others in my party got the lobster ravioli. The dish seems small (4 ravioli's) but I guess you're paying for the lobster. It was inside and outside of the ravioli's. It was good but nothing to write home about.   We did order the banana bread which is done flambe table side which was cool but the server didn't cook down the liquor enough so that was hard to eat without feeling that you'd be drunk from eating it.   Overall for $320 for 4 people, I wouldn't go back.",

The food portions are large so  don't be afraid to ask if you could split a meal.  My husband and I both ordered the Veal Parmesan.  Our waiter told us one order would be good enough for the two of us.   He  also told us to do the same with the Spicy Vodka Rigatoni.  He had the kitchen plate our pasta for us. When our Veal came out he cut it into four pieces and served us each a piece on to our plate with the pasta.. There're so many little extras that they do and give to you  at this restaurant.  You have to go try it yourself to understand and get the full experience.. By the way both of those dishes were fantastic!",

    "text": "Excellent food but seriously overpriced, in my opinion. They say that eating at Carbone's is like eating at your Grandmas house, but I don't remember Grandma hitting me up for $300 after dinner.  LOL.   We came to Carbone's while staying at the Aria for New Years. After rejecting the first two crappy tables we were offered, we were seated in a really cool booth that reminded me of the Vegas rat-pack days. A quick review of the menu let me know that the evening was not going to be cheap or even reasonable, so I sucked it up and just figured I'd enjoy the meal regardless of the cost, but I'd save the steak eating for another night (because the bone in ribeye for 2 was over $200). After ordering a glass of wine we decided to share a salad and a the mozzarella appetizer. We both ordered the rigatoni for the main course.   The watercress / blue cheese salad came first and was truly interesting in flavor, texture, and appearance but at almost $20 for a small salad, not a great value.   The mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer was next, and it was truly excellent. Fresh mozzarella and prosciutto made for magnificent flavors and was enough for 2. I don't recall the price but it was really worth having.   Next was the rigatoni. Although the flavor was excellent (spicy!!), it was served on a small plate with almost no presentation and for $27 seemed a little underwhelming. It did taste amazing but for that price, it should have been a bit more impressive. Along with the rigatoni we ordered 3 meatballs which were truly excellent.    Look Yelpers the food here is truly very good, but I just feel like there are much better values for the money in Vegas and at the Aria (try fifty 5 for some pizza!!). The service was also top notch, but I would be insistent about getting a good table as they will cram you into a two seater by the kitchen if you let them.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, the food, and the service but I thought the meal should have been about $100 cheaper. If money is no object, I think you'll have a great time here but for $250-$300, I was left feeling a little jaded.   Food      -  5 Stars Service  -  5 Stars Price      -  2 Stars  Overall 4 Stars.

    "text": "We dined at Carbone for my husband's birthday, on a quick weekend trip to Vegas. There were 5 of us total, and we had made a reservation about a week in advance, although I think you could get away with making one a day or two before (There we're still plenty of time slots when I had to make a quick change to the reservation the day before). Dress code seemed to range from suits to a couple people in jeans and t-shirts. We all dressed in business casual and felt appropriately dressed.  The Service: We had an overall pleasant dining experience, but we thought the service was lacking and the ordering process was a bit hard to understand. They recommend that you order in courses and share the food, which we found challenging to gauge how much food we needed (this was our first visit), and exactly how to split courses between 5 people. Everyone at my table was only able to order 1 drink or glass of wine, because we barely saw our waiter after our initial order. This was disappointing since it was our last night in Vegas, and we all intended to really celebrate. Although we were too full for dessert we were never offered the dessert cart, which again was disappointing as I would have liked to take something to go for later!  The Food: Initially they bring out bread, cheese, salami and pickled cauliflower. All of this was wonderful and more food than I was expecting from a \"pre-appetizer\". Make a grab for the tomato focaccia, it tastes like pizza and was our favorite.  We started with the octopus, which was a really great tasting dish, nice and crispy with peppers and potatoes. The portion was a bit smaller than I was expecting for $26, and is definitely not an appetizer to be shared by more than 2 people. Next we moved on to the \"pasta\" dish, and ordered the spicy vodka rigatoni, which was absolutely perfect and amazing, and frankly the only reason I am rating this restaurant so highly. A friend got the lobster ravioli, which was okay, no complaints. Finally we had the ribeye Diana, which was cooked closer to rare than the medium rare we requested. It was good, but not as good as some of the steak we've had in the Midwest. Others at the table had pork chops (fatty), veal Parmesan (could feed at least 3 people), and a really amazing chicken dish.  My biggest complaint was we ordered way too much food for the table, and we didn't have a great way to take it back and enjoy it later. They ended the night with the cookies and the limoncello, which was nice but since we hadn't seen our waiter in ages we were just anxious for the bill and to leave.  If you specifically want pasta then I'd recommend Carbone for the spicy rigatoni alone, but if you are looking for service and atmosphere, I would probably take my money somewhere else.",

For people concerned about portion size and price trust me you are not getting Olive Garden quality for an inflated price. This is upscale amazing Italian food and you it's so good that you want more!  Bread basket. You know your off to a good start when the bread basket is so good you would be fine eating just the bread basket. Tomato bread, garlic bread, flat bread and then a side of salami, mozzarella, and cauliflower. The garlic bread is sooo good perfect flavor crispiness and we had to order more because there was a battle for it.   Spicy rigatoni vodka was so good. Spicy layered tomato flavor with a little sweetness from the onions was so good and had just the right bite to the rigatoni and perfect sauce to pasta ratio.   Veal Parmesan so crispy, light, and perfectly tender. They put the tomato sauce and cheese on top but didn't drown the veal so it was still the star. Not overly greasy.   Tortellini al ragu so good little pillows of pasta stuffed with cheese and in light cheese tomato sauce was perfectly cooked. Want to eat this everyday.  Meatballs so tender, perfectly flavored, and so good with that garlic bread. Be sure to order more bread to pick up all of that sauce. Dense in flavor, but tender and light in texture. Makes you want to use all other meatballs as doorstops or paper weights from now on.  Banana fosters and tiramisu were only ok you can skip it. Everything else was so good you don't even need it.",

No doubt a splashy space, the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red, Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional \"red sauce\" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original, a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.  Clearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015, entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms, the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.  Championing the slogan \"every table deserves a captain,\" a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic, it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken, and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting, the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious, the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.  Breaking the menu down into four-courses, though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered, round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned, all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's, a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.  Taking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others, course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs, only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy,' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.  Onward to entrees, the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird, those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution, the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.  Enjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed, each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.  ** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please, Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip, yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe.",

But the clams casino were cold and mushy, and the meatballs were of a raw consistency in the middle. I mentioned this to the waiter, and he explained that they are cooked to the right temperature and I can feel comfortable eating them. Maybe, but they tasted and felt raw so we didn't eat them and the waiter did take them off the check without our asking, after he saw that they went untouched. Service was super slow and not that friendly. The grilled octopus was the standout of the meal, I'd go back for that and sit at the bar. Bar seemed fun and friendly.",

The food, of course, is overpriced, but you are paying to eat inside Aria - fine dining.  I had the angel hair AOP which I make at home all of the time.  It was $21.  Mine was a lot better.  I didn't care for it and it was a little spicy.  Odd.   The lobster cocktail was very good.  The bread they bring you and parmesan cheese was amazing.  The rigatoni was 'ok'.  I've had better for half the price.  It was $26.  But again amazing service, presentation, dessert was great.  I really like how they treat you there, and the process they have.  I'm just a girl of simple taste, and know that Pasta Mia West right down the street is better for half the price :)",

After he took our orders he came back once to briefly ask how the appetizer was and we never saw him again. He did give his undivided attention to every other table except ours. It was just my sister and I so it wasn't like we were a difficult table to take care of.   It was extremely frustrating when we asked for the check because we had a show to catch and were made to wait 30 minutes for it! He saw us multiple times waiting at our empty table but instead he preferred to strike casual conversation and jokes with everyone else. To make matters worse we saw him give the receipt to two other tables before we got ours by a completely different server.  I expected outstanding service but left extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with how we were treated.",

The spicy rigatoni was delish, the  langostines where out of this  world and  full delish flavors and tasty, along with the baked clams  was also delish.  However , the veal was very disappointing! The flavor was ok but, the meat was very fatty and it was like grizzle in our mouths. My boyfriend  really hated it. I had the Bronzino and it was very good!!!  Followed by a nice desert and expresso/sambuca. I love veal and had it in nyc Carbones and other restaurants that are just neighborhood Italian restaurants in nyc. Please review the veal!!!! It was gross!!! Sorry ;(",

My server Dion, was extremely helpful and made great recommendations. They start you off with complimentary salami and pickled cauliflower along with  fresh chunks of parmesan cheese.   Next we order the fresh mozzarella and OMFG it legit melts in your mouth. No joke, prob my fave part of the meal. Next the vodka rigatoni with a side of meatballs was prob the best meatball of my life added with a great rigatoni that was cooked perfect al dente and soaked up the sauce nicely.   At the end they give complimentary limoncello and cookies as you're sitting there thinking to yourself what you're getting next time you're here.   BEST MEAL OF MY FUCKING LIFE. CHECK IT OUT",

Pasta portions are quite small, and you do need to order quite a few menu items to adequately feed a party of 4. That being said, the food quality and flavors are excellent. I'm not sure that anything I had at Carbone is the best I have ever tasted, but everything I had was very good and satisfying. Service was very good, and the restaurant has a very nice dark and upscale atmosphere.  The shrimp cocktail was fresh and tasty, as was the lobster cocktail. The bread basket contained a variety of delicious breads, and they paired well with the chunks of Parmesan brought to the table. The fettuccini with mushrooms was delicious, as was the tortellini. Both pasta dishes were tiny, and I would have liked to have more.  Veal Parmesan was done very nicely, as was the bass prepared with fava beans. For dessert, we ordered bananas foster, which was prepared tableside. We also had a piece of tiramisu. Both were very good. Our wait staff also brought us limoncello and rainbow cookies on the house. Very nice!",

We sat in the first available seats at the bar and shortly after the bartender told us the seats were reserved and to move to the end of the bar. So we did and we were approached by a female bartender with drink menus. My sister ordered the \"stinger\" a drink made with Hennessy according to the menu, but while watching it be prepared the drink was poured with Remy Martin. She didn't want to make a big deal the bartender seemed pretty new so she accepted the drink. We then ordered our meals and the salad. She brought us cheese and bread. The salad came out and was prepared in front of us. The bartender begins mixing the salad together, she was attempting to add in croutons and a couple fell off onto the bar area where the drain is . She picked them up and was about to put it onto our salad. My sister quickly said it's ok and stopped her from adding them. We ate our salad which was very good. The dressing was yummy. As we waited for our food not once were we asked by neither bartender how the salad was or if we enjoyed our drinks or even if we needed a refill. So our food finally comes and it was phenomenal the spicy rigatoni has such a good flavor. But after our food arrived we were never asked how the food tasted, if we liked it, or if we needed anything. It was like they forgot about us. We noticed them conversing and paying a lot more attention to other people at the bar which is why we gave Carbone 3 stars. Not only that but there were multiple times we saw them eating behind the bar. It just wasn't the experience we expected for such a renowned restaurant. I would go back for the food but I would order it to go.",

The bar had a couple of open seats that had reserved labeled across them which was annoying since we would have had a drink while we waited but oh well. We had the chopped salad, veal parmigiana and spicy rigatoni. The food was out of the world. Dessert was the carrot cake which was outstanding. Highly recommend this place.",

We took our two small children and they were so accommodating and welcoming!!! The food is worth the pricey ticket!! Baked clams were terrific and the lobster ravioli to die for. My husband got the ribs which he didn't love but they looked good to be and the portion was pretty large. My favorite the sea urchin baked clams and the pickle cauliflower that came with the bread and homemade salami... Love Love Love this place!",

The dinning experience  is set in multiple delicious course after delicious course. I will offer a few stand outs. Not to be missed starts with an item off the cocktail list, The Old Fashioned. It's made with rum and it's delicious. I'd say my favorite portion of the meal and the True stand outs are the pastas, in particular, the incredible sauces they are draped in. Try the spicy rigatoni in pink saucewas not a big fan of our steak. It was a bit gamey tasting for me. I'd recommend an appetizer and pasta for each person. If your incredibly hungry share a meat dish on top of that and if not go right to dessert. I'm not sure why it took me so long to find this place but now that I know of it I'll be here at every Vegas visit!",

It has a really good feel to it--upscale, but comfortable.  I started with a glass of red while my friend had cranberry and vodka.  We asked about dessert.  This is one of those places that rolls up the dessert cart that always looked decadent.  We were compelled to get the chocolate cake--that was absolutely great, with great creamy layers.  We followed that up with some port that was really good--great choice be bartender.  It was so good, we had a second glass.  The food looked really good also--I definitely want to come back and hope it is just as good as the cake.",

The second time, I ate alone at the bar, which was a very experience (and pretty much your only option if you are going on the fly, even on a random weeknight at 9pm).  The standards are spectacular: the rigatoni, the caesar (made tableside), the meatballs. Cocktails & wine selection are both also fantastic.  It's a fun environment that feels actually authentic - very refreshing vs. the rest of the Vegas vibe. I like how old school and traditional it is. Looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Decided to eat here on our last night in Vegas. We came in a bit early at 6pm due to a red eye flight and was immediately seated in one of their intimate red curtained booths towards the back of the restaurant. Carbone provided an impressive amount of food before we even ordered our meal, including a slice of Parmesan cheese, pickled cauliflower, spicy salami and a bread basket with 3 different types of bread. I only tried the focaccia (which was a bit too salty) and the garlic bread which was pretty yummy! For our meal, we ordered a lot of things based on our waiter's recommendations. We ordered the baked clams as our app which was soooo good! Definitely recommend! It offered the clams baked in 3 different ways and the middle three with breadcrumbs was my fave! It comes with 9 clams so it was a generous serving. We then ordered the spicy vodka rigatoni along with the tortellini alla ragu with 2 meatballs on the side. Although the rigatoni is what the restaurant is famous for, I definitely enjoyed the tortellini more! The pasta was cooked to perfection and it just melts in your mouth. I would definitely order that pasta again! Lastly, a dessert cart is brought to your table and a selection of the desserts are on display for your choosing. We whittled our choices down to the lemon cheesecake and the Nutella tiramisu and once again, chose the cheesecake as per our waiter's recommendation. Along with the delicious cheesecake, two rainbow cookies as well as some limoncello was delivered complimentary with the bill.   All in all, Carbone definitely delivered a great dining experience with great service. Will try the NYC one soon!",

I was about half hour late on my reservation, due to my own fault and my driver was running behind as well, anyhoo, I called.....and my table was saved. My husband and I had the best table reserved, and they held it! Atmosphere is unbelievable...... A vibrant, but yet romantic, Hollywood kinda feel, totally up our alley. Service was on point, we had about 3 to 4 people wait on us, and every single one was beyond perfect! I had had so much to drink prior to my meal, that I really wasn't all that hungry. We started out with a chunk of the Parmiggiano cheese, complimentary, with some hot salami and pickled coluflower. Their bread is sooo good, I can't even explain it. We ordered the seafood salad to start off, the lobster was tender and cooked to perfection. I ordered lobster ravioli of course, and they were delicious. My husband ordered a new York strip, and that was ridiculous..... I only had a few bites, and he still couldn't finish it. We also ordered a side of mushrooms, and kid you not, they were fantastic. I had to pass on dessert, I was so full and had to catch a show later on, so we left fast. Overall experience was truly wonderful. I usually do not eat out Italian because, once again, I'm Italian and cook authentic ..but this one was a real nice treat! Hats off to Chef Mario Carbone, looking forward to dine at your New York eatery!!! Cheers to a fabulous dinner and a pretty great life!",

The small booths along the wall are very uncomfortable to sit in due to the huge table  base underneath. There is no place to put your foot and the height of the table leaves no room to cross your legs. The menus are beautiful but ridiculously large! 2 people cannot sit next to each other in the booth and have them open without moving apart. There is not enough on the menu to support this oversized menu.  The service was ok. But, I had to track down a busser for an additional glass of wine and the check.  The steak was fatty and not flavorful, the potatoes were greasy and the vegetables were spicy. The meatballs were undercooked and didn't have much flavor. The bring you cheese, meat and bread with an odd cabbage before your meal. Everything but the cabbage was good. The end your meal with lemon hello and a small desert. Didn't care for either. It was $14 for a beer and $64 for a fatty steak.",

    "text": "One can have great food, but nothing can kill a great experience more than to pair it with such horrendous service. Several good friends highly recommended Carbone including some of the discriminating friends that we went with that evening. We chose this restaurant to celebrate two birthdays and had a well-placed table of 11 (mostly foodies). Ordered amazing wines, Quintarelli and Biondi Santi, lots of starters and sides and of course, their tableside-filleted Dover sole, among their highly recommended homemade pastas.  Food, great. Wine, what little we had, amazing. Let me explain how to ruin an evening with great food and wine.  NO SERVICE...had to beg.  After opening and pouring the first pours, they left the wine bottles on the table and never came back to refill glasses or offer additional selections. Never came back to refill water, ask for cocktails, we had to get up twice to ask if someone could bring more water to the table.  Three of our guests, left the table discreetly to ask what was going on and why no one was coming to service our table while the 4-top table next to us was being well-attended to.  They forgot to bring out three different side dishes we had ordered (total of 6 dishes). Completely forgot. They offered to put the orders in after bringing out the main courses.  Of course, our table was a mess. Empty cocktail, wine and water glasses, empty wine bottles left on table, no one came by to take empty dishes away or sweep debris before dessert.  I have to admit the dishes were great, however, there are a lot of extraordinary restaurants in Vegas. Carbone lost our faith and our referrals. Each of us traveled in from all over to attend this birthday gathering which made it all the more disappointing. Even if they were shorthanded that evening, they could have explained it to us and at least make sure we weren't parched by the end of the evening. Bummed.",

    "text": "There's already a billion Italian restaurants within walking distance of this one, serving basically the same food at price points of varying exorbitance, so why would you choose this one? Ambiance!   The shtick here is over-the-top retro Dago chic: checkered linoleum floor, obnoxious doo-wop blaring, tacky gilt accents and a massive fountain of crystal jizz doubling as a chandelier, aggressively spooging an unimpeachably Hi-Class aesthetic over everything. Basically, it's like being on the set of Goodfellas. Fabulous!  Lest you think I'm being overly snarky, their advertising confirms that ambiance is their focus -- \"Every meal deserves a captain,\" as in, this goombah lunk in a burgundy velour suit who schmoozes you, takes your order, takes your photo, tells you the specials and answers your questions about the menu. A separate \"front waiter\" actually brings you the food, and a back waiter (i.e. busser) comes around to crumb your table and refill your water glass and whatnot. Meanwhile there's also a sommelier and a cheese guy who comes around spearing chunks off a giant wheel of parmigiano reggiano...because that's how they used to do/still do in hi-class places. Even, apparently, places with linoleum floors and ear-splitting doo-wop.  Even tho food isn't the priority here, and even tho I'm not a fan of Italian, what I had was REALLY good: truffle beef carpaccio, Caesar salad, antipasti, assorted baked clams, penne alla vodka, veal parmigiana, cheesecake. Even the freaking bread basket was exceptional (thanks to the guy with the cheese wheel). Drinks were also above standard -- I had a negroni and my friend had an old-fashioned, and both were fantastic. The sommelier paired wines for us with each dish, and those were all great, too. (No wonder I feel like shit today....I just realized how much I ate and drank last night. Ugh!)  I should note that I wasn't paying for any of this, so that probably made everything taste a LOT better...as the only dago joint on the Strip MY budget allows for is the Sbarro at Ballys. I didn't even look at the prices of anything, but I'm assuming because it's at the Aria they are probably exorbitant...so be warned.   Anyway, I would definitely come here again, if only to sit in the fabulous bar area and sip a Campari -- but next time, I would wear some kind of chiffon frock, with my hair sprayed black and teased into a beehive. Hit me up if you want to go -- I've got a zoot suit and xtra-large jug of Dippity Do you can borrow; bonus points if there are blood spatters on your shoes. We can pretend it's 1962, and that you just got out of jail and I'm about to embark on an uninterrupted 20-year span of pregnancies. The ambiance here is so legit, it'll really feel like we fell thru some kind of wormhole.   Until one of us has to hit the head -- the fun stops jarringly and abruptly once you enter the bathroom, which has zero charm. I've seen better guinea shtick in the pissoir at Bucca di Beppo's; step up your pishadu game, Carbone!",

The fish was $110. Portion wasn't very big. Outrageous prices for mediocre food and snobby service. Will dispute the charge!  They should warn people about the prices. We went to SW steakhouse at the Wynn and got the same tomahawk steak for $130. Don't waste your money!!! UPDATE: WON THE DISPUTE! Carbone couldn't provide proof of the price for the $485 steak! Maybe they will warn people of the price next time!  HORRIBLE PLACE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

We wanted to go a little later and my son found a reservation at 6:15, so I canceled my reservation. We walked in and found out he had accidentally made the reservation for Sunday! It was after midnight and he searched for \"tomorrow\" on open table. We were so disappointed but the hostess was so nice and managed to get us a table in the bar and let us know we couldn't linger which was fine with us. The food and service were both awesome. The caesar salad is great and the croutons are delicious. We loved the spicy pasta! The bread is to die for.",

The fish was heavy and greasy with an over browned butter sauce that  I found to to be almost stomach turning. Hoping to salvage the meal, tiramisu was ordered thinking it should be in the strike zone for an Italian restaurant. Nope. I found the dessert dry and inedible.  The lady finger, which to me is an integral element to any tiramisu was just placed on top almost as an afterthought. The coffee was good though.",

We shared the veal Parmesan and spicy vodka rigatoni and both were good.   We had a glass of Leviathan and the Barolo. Both were good.   We finished with espresso and complimentary lemoncello.   We did not care for the music - the 50s/60s music seemed out of place with the ambience. A little too loud and upbeat.   Overall a great experience, although a bit expensive.",

    "text": "As locals living in Vegas, we rarely dine on the strip. Carbone is a fine example of why we stay away. It was so loud we could hardly hear our waiter, who was just creepy to begin with. He told us about his favorite dishes while ignoring our questions. The menus are also so large in size, it just just obnoxious. There are not that many options, why make the menu so huge? It literally blocked you from seeing/hearing the people sitting just next to you.   I ordered a vodka soda before my dinner, and the metal straw it was served with has some one else's lipstick on it. I do understand mistakes are made, but gross. It also took so long to bring this attention to a waiter that the drink was entirely melted by the time it was taken away.  As a vegetarian, I understand I am not the target guest for restaurants like this but we had reservations with friends so this is where we ate. I ordered the minestrone soup which was green for some reason but absolutely flavorless. A bit of salt would have helped a lot but there was none on the table and getting attention of our waiter was nearly impossible. I also had the chopped salad which was just so weird. It had radicchio, beans, tomato and some other things. It was spicy and weird, not tasty at all. For my meal, it was as if no one had tried these things they were serving to me. The friends we ate with, liked what they had which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars. But this place was just too overpriced for that they serve and how they serve it.",

When every other party sat down, the Captain came over right away and introduced himself. This never happened for us. We would have loved to have a Captain so they could explain the menu that offered little description of the food.",

Had several pasta dishes but the two that really stood out is the vodka and clam one, both were delicious!  Even the complimentary bread is really good... but the best part for me was the pork chop.  I never order pork chop because it is usually dry and hard, but the pork chop at Carbone is simply the best pork chop I have ever had in my life.  Incredibly tender, despite its thickness, and very flavorful.  I would definitely come back to this place.",

They bring bread ,Parmesan , pickled cauliflower which was the best part of the food . I told the waiter to \"please bring everything as it's ready ,we are really hungry \" . He brought our salad and about 30 min later I reminded him about our food . Another 15 min while there was still salad left because my friend wanted to save some salad to have with her meal . I asked if it was going to take much longer . He said we don't serve entrees while there is salad still .!! Really ??!!! The disgusting food finally comes out but too gross to eat. And they charge for fountain drinks refills . Cute place , super over priced horrible food , dumb servers . Not sure how they have some five star reviews ?  Won't be back !",

Who talks to someone like that when your paying for good quality dinner and service. Overall the food was good but the service was pathetic.

The pasta (hand made) is actually pretty good, but the sauce was not.  I love spicy food but my pasta was over the top.  The tuna was very fresh - very nice cut - but completely devoid of flavor.  Fail.  All that said - these guys are new, and they are likely working out some kinks so it is possible I will return in the distant future, but for now I would avoid.

We had a multi course experience of food & drinks for two people and we spent under $300. Very satisfied and so full. They gave us a cozy curtained booth that was very charming, perfect for date night. From the start we felt so well taken care of, stewards & waiters were friendly & thoughtful. Tableside is the name of the game: specialty rum drinks, Caesar salad, flambe dessert, it felt like dinner with a show! We really enjoyed it, plus all the complimentary extras like antipasto of cheese salami cauliflower and bread; limoncello & cookies; nuts & tangerine. Our entree was shared ribeye Diane & potatoes Louie. Terrific presentation. Also had a meatball, and loved the rare cook on beef. Would call this upscale old-school, with Frank Sinatra cool.

Service was not great, a little slow in fact. Felt like they were understaffed or maybe that's just the pace of American Italian restaurants. Decor and ambience was very Goodfellas  but a little too noisy for conversation.

    "text": "Holy flipping goodness! This place was an absolute treat, but as Yelp clearly states, bring your checkbook as it is not cheap in the least. With that said you know going in this is a special occasion and one with some spectacular Italian cuisine. The ambiance inside was dark, yet beautiful at the same time. As for the service, top notch, the staff no when to dip in and can easily suggest something that fits your preference. I was unfortunately here for business, so phones usually go on silent and hidden away for meals, but will break down the apps and mains we ordered.   Beet Salad - 8/10  Various breads with butter and oil - 9/10 Caesar Salad - 10+/10 - Do not miss out on this show and dish. Rib Eye - 10/10 - Wow...just wow.. Chicken - 10+/10 - Some of the most moist and delish chicken I have had in some time. Tiramisu & Cheesecake - 8/10 - Not a huge Cheesecake guy, but it was good. Tiramisu was phenomenal though!  So with all of that said, people were not kidding about the caesar salad. They pull out a cart and hand craft the whole thing for you (Dressing and all), right in front of you. I still dream about those croutons to this day, I wish I could get a bag of them to go. As for the ribeye and chicken, I have only been wowed a few times in my life, and this was one when it comes to those dishes. Cooked to perfection, moist, marinated just enough, but not too much to take over. I was just in a state of bliss while munching away, not going to lie. As for the desserts, I am usually a gelato/ice cream guy, but they were fantastic and I am sure the others with me would have the same comments as me. As mentioned in the very beginning this is an experience you would not want to miss if you are staying at the ARIA or just nearby and really want to splurge on a meal and or experience.",

My only complaint is that these people try to pressure you into buying more food than you want to.   I saw numerous people comment on yelp that if you didn't order a ton of dishes per person they get mad. There's a lot of truth to this, our waiter seemed offended that we didn't want a ton of appetizers. When ordering entrees most of us ordered spicy rigatoni vodka, a dish they're famous for. Our waiter kept making comments like we weren't going to be full and we needed to order an actual entree. When we refused he kept saying \"OK WHATEVER, I'm just trying to help you\" which was complete BS, It was so obvious that this guy wanted us to stack up the bill with food that we didn't want or need. He did this to every person at our table. He was literally trying to shame people into spending more money, it was weird and unprofessional.   The crazy thing is the cost of our meal was still well over $500 (he got a huge tip) yet this waiter made us feel as if we were peasants because we didn't want three dishes per person. We left the place plenty full despite our waiter saying otherwise. I'm sure these waiters/waitresses are accustomed to $1000 + tables with people that come to Vegas on company money, but they really need to be brought down to reality. Not everyone is going to buy an expensive bottle of wine and a bunch of $36 appetizers. I will absolutely come back here, I loved the food and despite the shaming, the service was completely on point.",

Italian is expensive as it is, let alone an Italian strip location. We came here on a whim to be spontaneous and I didn't review the yelpers opinion prior to coming (I usually always do) and it's a spontaneous decision that didn't turn out 100% how id like it to!

The margarita and the White Lady (it has egg white!) were solid, well-balanced, and are like cocktails of old yore. We only had room for the Caesar salad, and they brought out the full gamut of welcome dishes for us...lovely chunks of parm, picked cauliflower, a full bread basket of 3 different types of fresh bread, and salami. If I wasn't so full from the last two stops, I could easily polish off more than 3 pieces of parm. The salami came to room temperature and had a lovely barnyard-y funk that I adore. The salad was easily the best Caesar salad I've ever had...garlicky, creamy, cheesy, and super well-dressed without being overdressed. Going to have to eat this every time we stay here. We even got the lovely rainbow cookies, too. Service was exceptional at the bar.",

The meal starts with a nice assortment of warm bread. All the different breads tasted amazing, especially the pizza flavored one!    For appetizers we had the Caprese salad. It was some of the best Caprese Ive ever had and was the highlight of dinner for me. They come out with fresh warm mozzarella, and cut it on top of the salad at the table, which adds a nice visual touch. The heirloom tomatoes were perfect and the cherry tomatoes tasted like candy.  Incredible.   For main course we both had the Spicy Rigatoni.  The pasta was cooked perfect and sauce was decent.  It was just a little bit plain tasting it, I think it could use some more seasoning or herbs on it.  It was also a very small portion size so I wouldn't recommend sharing!   For a side we did the Truffle corn, which was recommended by our waiter. It was pretty good. Very sweet and not too much truffle.   We will definitely be back to Carbone to try some more of the menu!",

The ambiance is unique -- it is intimate, yet feels like what one would imagine an old school, authentic Italian restaurant to be. Our server was very knowledgeable and exuded a sense of confidence that made talking about the items on the menu very conversational instead of leaving one to feel like they are being schooled.  He made some excellent recommendations and we indulged in some great food. The portions are generous and food rich so I definitely ended up with left overs. We started off with a generous portion of baked clams and a very delicious gin based cocktail. We also indulged in the very hearty yet delicious Octopus Pizzaiolo. My husband deviated from pasta based dish and ordered double lamb chops. They were perfectly cooked, extremely filing but oh so delicious. Lamb is one of those proteins where you know your stomach will pay for it later, yet you feel it is so worth it. After such rich appetizers I opted for lobster ravioli which was great, but thankfully not as heavy as the other dishes we tried. Everything was enjoyable, and per our usual we topped off the meal with a cappuccino. At the conclusion of our dinner we were presented with complimentary spumoni and house made limoncello which ended the meal on a very sweet note. I would recommend this restaurant for those looking to splurge on great Italian food and unique ambiance.",

It was one of those occasions where every one tries each other's food and then is jealous of each other's  food.  Not because what you got wasn't to die for but because everything was so good.    The service was unbeatable.  The manager gave me her card and personal cell phone number and told me to call her anytime I returned to the strip.    Funny story.  I received an important emergency call and rushed out of the restaurant to take it.  In my haste, I ran straight into a wall.  I looked up and that wall was actually Alistair Overeem.  He was actually quite cool about it.  But my voice must have raised 10 octaves for my \"excuse me, I'm so sorry.\"      All in all Carbone added to/enhanced an already amazing night.   (And I see people saying how expensive Carbone is.  And yes, it is quite pricy.  However, a reasonable person wouldn't go to Carbone hoping for Olive Garden pricing. )",

Holy crap did Carbone exceed all of my wildest dreams and then some.   The Caesar salad was to die for- and the amount or garlic will have you questioning how strong your relationship is- can I kiss my date after this? The server asks if you'd like anchovies in the salad or on the side which I appreciate since not everyone is a fan. I just ate them all which was perfect. The octopus is top three, the best I've had in Vegas. So freaking tender and cooked to perfection.   As a non-pasta fan I wasn't convinced I'd be excited over the spicy rigatoni, but it was nothing short of amazing. However, I wouldn't order the lobster ravioli again, but would be tempted to try another pasta along with the rigatoni again. The stars of the show in my opinion were the meatballs and the potatoes Louis. So flavorful, so tender, I don't even like meatballs!!!!! HOW?! The potatoes are so tender and cooked in duck fat, and even as left overs are still fantastic.   The service is just as amazing as the food, and nothing short of perfection. Al behind the bar is a True professional as well as everyone who dropped off the food. Kevin the managers made sure my friend & I had a great time and were enjoying everything that we were eating.

The table setup was super cute with little painted plates and wine glasses.  Our server Chad was very attentive and gave us the heads up on all the good food and drink suggestions. Especially on the Caprese salad. He said they will run out sometimes so we HAD to try it. Omg, so good. They use fresh mozzarella that the server cuts in front of you and heirloom tomatoes.  My favorite entree was the ravioli and the meatballs.",

    "text": "A classic Italian Steakhouse and Italian Restaurant, beautiful layout, dark, dining lights, velvet curtains, cute booth. Intimate and inviting, perfect for date night. Except when we need to look at the menu/wine list we need our iphone light ;)   The booth is so cute that made you want to make out! HA  Other private rooms, good for big group and corporate events.  The large bar and lounge you can hit with big group before shows.  We really enjoyed the cute booth for 2. We had an awesome server Dion. He's as good as it gets. He was attentive, accommodating and wonderful.  Some of the entree can get pricier such as steak, lamb or fish.  Love the complimentary salami/fresh bread, yummy!   We had the special langoustines 3 for $68. The baked clam of 9 for only $25 is a steal!  Lamb chop was delicious, but a tiny bit fatty. The lobster ravioli was good. The Vodka pasta was a winner! Octopus too! The basic Angel Hair hits the spot as a side dish. The back server/bus boy forgot to pack the left over to go for us :-(  Wines list was IMPRESSIVE, all things ITALIAN please!  Overall is a great place! But for those who price sensitive, stick to the small plate & pasta. You still have a great time here!  Carbone is definitely a great addition at the Aria hotel, a MLife Group, so you can wine and dine and rack up your points!!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Carbone and it didn't disappoint. We had a hard time picking just a few to try but settled on the carpaccio, spicy rigatoni vodka with meatballs (latter not on the menu but a house specialty), and the whole branzino. I loved everything except the fish.  First off, the bread basket, to me, was just average (too bland and the garlic one was too oily) but the real star was the pickled cauliflower. A little tart and a little spicy! The salami on the side was a nice surprise too. The carpaccio appetizer might be my favorite one ever, and I've had a lot. Great flavor, great texture, and I think the quality speaks for itself. I could eat this all by myself.   I can see why the rigatoni is a classic because it really is perfectly done. Al dente with an exceptional sauce. The meatball is solid but I think I still prefer Rao's.   The brazino was where the meal went slightly downhill. We had some fish scales and bones which didn't make for a great experience. I also thought that for $95 a whole branzino needed something more than just a fish with three sauces. Luckily, the \"captain\" provided great service and comped the fish. I don't think we would order again even if it was prepared properly. It's just not worth the $.  We'd love to return but will stick with the starters and pastas. Also, I have to mention that service is really slowwwww, so prepared for the long meal!",

    "text": "Normally we aren't fans of Italian restaurants, but this one was recommended to us during our recent visit to Las Vegas.  We checked in around 8PM and were asked if we had reservations.  It didn't occur to me that the place might have been one of those \"popular restaurants\" requiring a reservation.  Lucky for us, it wasn't but there were quite a bit of people so that was a good sign.  We weren't very hungry so I decided to split a salad and an entree with my daughter.  The captain seemed a little surprised, but went above and beyond to accommodate our dinner order.  He didn't recommend Spaghetti Puttanesca because he said kids don't usually like it.  Instead he said he would put in an order for Spaghetti with a \"meat sauce\", which is not on the menu.   We also went with the sizzling pancetta as an appetizer since we were eating so light.  What I did not account for was the different kinds of bread, the fresh off the block slices of parmesan cheese, and the crispy salami (all gratis).  Just that alone was filling.  Everything was excellent, it was really unexpected how good it all was.  There were different kinds of bread and normally at Italian restaurants, it feels like the bread is there for filler.  Not so at Carbone, the bread really starts the eating the experience.  We were trying to pace ourselves because the bread, cheese, and salami were so good.  My daughter who is usually picky requested more cheese and fought over who got the last salami.  Then the pancetta came out.  I would have been satisfied eating the just that alone.  Nicely prepared with nice pieces of meat, it did not feel like you were eating pork fat.   The salad was excellent as well, we ordered a Caesar salad so I expected a run of the mill salad but it tasted extremely fresh.  The parmesan cheese was grated fresh off the block, the dressing was not the bottled tasting variety, and the anchovies were served on the side.  It was a level of detail I had not expected from a restaurant where we could just walk in.  The Spaghetti was excellent as well.  My daughter and I pretty much licked all the plates clean and felt very satisfied with our \"light meals\".  Afterwards, we were asked if we wanted dessert and politely declined.  I had a quick look at the dessert cart and was cursing myself for eating so much and not saving room for dessert.  Since we declined, the captain offered us cookies instead and lemoncito.  I never had lemoncito before, so I had to look up what it was and was surprised find that it's an after dinner drink (again gratis).  I definitely will add Carbone to the must dine at list when we are in Vegas.  5 star service and 5 star food.",

I would not return due to the snobby, petty & unprofessional maitre d's and waitstaff. We had a 9:45 reservation, being pregnant and STARVING we got there at 9:15 and saw at least 10 open tables for two. We were advised that we would not be able to be sat until our reservation time. The ten open tables remainded empty until we ended up getting sat at one of them when the clock struck exactly 9:45. Frankly I think we would've been sat sooner had we not had a reservation. However, if the maitre'd was less snobby and were more pleasant it would've changed the entire experience. We often frequent the New York location so it made it that much more shocking.",

In our view were the adorable two diner booths cloaked in red, draped velvet,  that make the diners look like they are eating while perched on a theater balcony.  It's a very striking effect.  The wine list was extensive and the food, well, nothing short of amazing.  As an Italian, I'm pretty picky about my red sauces but theirs did not disappoint.  The freshness of the ingredients was apparent, simply delicious.  The Caesar salad was prepared tableside with great flair. We all enjoyed our pasta and fish then topped it off with delicious desserts.  If you enjoy lemon, DO order the lemon cheesecake.  It is the best I've had.  Special thanks to the manager, Andy, who stopped by our table to chat. He certainly knows how to give extraordinary service.  It was a great night.  I recommend highly!",

Though pricey, this place is worth it because of all the freebies that come with a meal! Limoncello, cauliflower, bread, and dessert just to name a few!   The service here can be slow, but it is always knowledgeable and courteous. The reason I've only given 4 stars instead of 5 is because although MOST of their food is delicious (I recommend the beef carpaccio, seafood stew, and any fish dish they offer) the pasta here is not very good. I highly recommend if you have a craving for pasta you get it somewhere else.   Overall, I'll be returning because this place is so delicious and I love the atmosphere(especially the background music from the 50s!) I'll just not be ordering the pasta.",

For entrees we got the spicy rigatoni and lobster ravioli. We're not heavy eaters and found this to be enough food. If you like to pig out then I recommend one more appetizer. We did have an issue with one of our entrees and they took care of it immediately.  I would highly remommend this even if you remotely like Italian food. It's worth the price you pay.

What makes Carbone stand out?  The restaurant is nice and cozy. We were served a small chunk of Parmigiano Reggiano and a warm and delicious basket of bread including garlic bread, sesame and pizza.  Chicken Massimo: Tender and juicy half of a chicken. The skin is nice, crisp and full of flavor. 4/5  Tortellini al Ragu: Soft pillows of pasta filled with ricotta on a bed of creamy tomato sauce. The flavors were delicate. 4/5  Cherry Pepper Ribs: I'm not crazy over ribs. But these are glorious. The first bite, you taste sweetness...then, things get really hot. Kind of like the beginning of a relationship...or porn if you're single. 5/5  Lobster Ravioli: These were ok. I've had better lobster ravioli else where to be quite honest. The lobster was chopped into tiny pieces - I don't like that. 3/5  Nutella Tiramisu: I was very disappointed. If you name something by the ingredient used, you should be able to taste it, right? All I tasted was lemon and maybe a hint of coffee. Where's the Nutella??? 1/5  Bananas Foster: Bananas, ice cream, amaretto cookies with freshly made caramel sauce. It's a show as your server flambes your bananas. Hot + cold, soft + crunchy = delicious fun times! 4/5  At the end of the meal, you get limoncello and rainbow cookies. They're good rainbow cookies!",

    "text": "We were really looking forward to coming here on our annual trip to Las Vegas. My husband researched many restaurants and ultimately chose this one due to the menu and positive reviews, and in the weeks leading up to our trip he mentioned many times how excited he was to go to Carbone. Unfortunately, what we experienced was not quite what we had hoped for and we believe the primary reason for that is that we were younger than most of the crowd there and it was assumed we would not spend as much money.  We were seated at a small, two-person booth that gave us a view of our section and the restaurant's fun decor that paid homage to old Italian restaurants. Keith came over right away and provided us with fresh parmesan cheese, and explained a bit to us about the menu and then shared that our server would be right over. After a few minutes and no appearance from our waiter, Keith took our drink order and then reassured us that again, our server would be right over. Forty-five minutes after being sat, the server had still not come to our table and instead spent his time schmoozing with every other table in our section, including those that had been sat after us.  In that time, Keith came back to us and we ordered our food through him and also asked to speak to the manager. It took the manager another 20 minutes to come talk to us, and by then our server had stopped by to make us a caesar salad and finally introduce himself. The manager wasn't much help and instead thanked us for the kind words about Keith (who we talked up because at that point, he was the only reason we were still there) and told us he'd take care of us when it was time for dessert.  Overall, the food was everything we hoped for but we were very disappointed by our experience. Unfortunately for the restaurant, we were prepared to spend much more on our dinner had we received reasonable service and actually been treated with respect like everyone else in our section. The two stars on this review is solely for the delicious food and the excellent service that Keith provided, but I couldn't give more than that based on how negative we felt throughout our time at Carbone.",

    "text": "This place is way overpriced for the food you get. We ordered the caprese salad which was quite large. The pros: mozzarella was fresh and light, tomatoes are in season and a few different varieties were available. Cons: way too much olive oil, so much it tasted like the tomatoes were drowned in it. Pastas: gluten free in pomodoro sauce-- the sauce was bitter most likely from over acidity of the tomatoes. The gluten free pasta was chewy. My husband ordered spicy rigatoni which was \"spicy\" but not prevalent on many other flavors. Lastly, we ordered the corn side. It has truffle on it which is a plus. However, the black pepper washed all the flavor out. All of this came close to $100 for sub par food. I didn't read the other reviews till now-- if you are vegetarian, avoid this place. You just feel like you paid too much.",

Over several visits I've had the Rigatoni with spicy Vodka Sauce, Tortellini al Ragu, and Fettuccine with Mushrooms from the pasta side. Their pasta is so well prepared it is worth the extra money. The Caesar Salad is a show and delight. The Caprese has the best tomatoes and homemade mozzarella available. Dover Sole is server table side and surgically precise removal of every bone.  Cocktails fantastic with exceptional bartenders in Robert, Bernie and Kirk. Can't wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas.",

Our captain came and gave us their special for the day and explained the entire menu and gave us his recommendations. We were then served complimentary spicy salami, bread basket(which was phenomenal with three types of breads) and a pickled cauliflower also. We started with a tuna appetizer ($20) which he loved. For the entree we got the spicy ragitoni vodka($28) and lobster ravioli ($39)! It was my boyfriends birthday and our chef friend brought us out a veal entree and side of potatoes. For desert they bring around a cart and we chose the lemon cheesecake which was a treat, it had so many flavors like nothing I've tasted before. Lastly they served us lemonchello with house cookies!   The experience was awesome, loved the decor and service! The only downside was the entree were small but the taste was worth the try!",

They wouldn't seat us until our entire party was there, so we sat in the bar waiting for our table. We were totally late for our reservation but they didn't even blink an eye.  The service was amazing and the food was very good.   They kept pushing us to order family style, and said we would have way too much food if we didn't. The pasta and salad orders were not large so this didn't make sense at all. They also were pushing us to order a bunch of entrees to share, on top of the pasta orders we were sharing. This didn't make sense to me since we had some vegetarians at the table, and the entrees were all meat. We ended up ordered one of the steaks to share since some of the girls wanted a protein. I get why he was pushing the entrees so badly. This was the most expensive steaks I've ever seen. I've been to many steak houses but was surprised to see on the bill the steak for $135! I was expecting it to be closer to $80. We didn't ask what MP was for the steak when we ordered and they didn't offer up the information.  I think this place is great for a nice meal in Vegas but make sure you ask what MP is before you order so you know what you are paying. They will push family style but if all you want is pasta then there is no need. Also, they charge for refills on soda, which is a bit messed up. I recommend this place but I think the prices on the entrees are over priced and they don't offer up the pricing info before you order.",

Best spicy rigatoni dish ever! Their meatballs were soft and tender with the perfect amount of marinara sauce. They give you a good portion of cheesy bread and butter and fermented veggies in the beginning and a cookie for dessert. Portions are definitely small but worth every penny! The servers are very attentive and super friendly.",

We had the beet salad, ribeye, and lobster ravioli and all were excellent.  The lobster ravioli definitely didn't skimp on the lobster.

I'm not even at main course yet and I was blown away!!! Then we got to the appetizer, the carpaccio and the grilled squid is amazing!!! perfect taste and texture on both. Then we had zuppa and also lobster ravioli for main course. The zuppa tasted so fresh, so good, so perfect. Lobster ravioli had great texture and taste. This place is probably the best Italian restaurant I've ever had in the USA. I would definitely come back heer again. The service was great as well. The lady took care of all 10 of us and recommended all the right dishes. They even gave us free dessert and lemoncello(sp?) for our wedding celebration. Very satisfied with this place!

    "text": "This place just opened Monday.  Considering it just opened it was amazing.  Sevice was a little slow but there were 8 of us and they were crowded. The meal is family style old school Vegas meets old school italian \"Justa lika Mama make A\"  Menu has old school classic coctails like Rusty Nail, Manhattan,  etc. The waiter was really looking out for us. I told him that the bartender forgot my limes with my drinks and he offered to break his legs. The waiter is definitely customer oriented. LOL.    I was disappointed that they didn't have Malbec or Red Zinfandel on the wine menu. Really the only disappointment at Carbone.  I like Red Zin especially with red mest and red sauce. Seemed limited in that aspect.  We did order a bottle of Failla Pinot which was excellent based on the sommelier recommendation.   Baked clams with 3 different types are what you'd find in an  NY style italian joint. Crabcake was placed on top of artichike heart. Lemon zest inside and was the best eva.  I had a classic tableside caesar with \"medium rare\" croutons. Fresh & flavorful.   I wouldn't go to this place without ordering the Lobster Ravioli. DARK Green pasta stuffed with fresh chunky lobster on a cream sauce. But wait...They topped the plate off with tons of fresh lobster on top of the lobster ravioli. Unbelievable.  Imagine the best ravioli you've ever had. This is about 4 steps better. Really. Big green soft pillows of heaven. I could probably eat that ravioli everyday.  We also had ribeye, veal and ribs.  Cooked to perfection. We had the scallops too. Very good soft scallops in a lite sauce with herbs. I thought we ordered veal marsala but it was in a demiglaze. It may have beeen ordered that way because there were several veal dishes. All very good but the Ravioli should make everyone's bucket list. The waiter gave us a hard sell on the acorn squash. I'm not a fan but the acorn squash was like wow. I wouldn't go there without ordering the acorn. It was truly amazing. Topped with a cream sauce and pumkin seeds.   Ended with a shared piece of carrotcake with ginger frosting. Very good. It seemed to resemble a bunt cake in the form. It was topped with dehydrated carrot strands. Very good with a unique texture.   The meal wasn't cheap luckily one of my company's partners paid the bill. It is pricey but I'd spend my own money going there.   Ps. They had regular garlic bread (crunchy and dripping with butter) and focaccia garlic bread (very soft and pillowy).  If the food  or the bill doesn't give you a heart attack then you'll really like the place. Overall it was a memorable meal. I just wouldn't expect to do.much after eating there outside of loosening my belt and passing out. You'll waddle out of there and back to do your Vegas thing.",

The bar and restaurant's ambience is gorgeous and the feel to the bar is upscale, yet very very social and down to earth. I easily made several conversations with folks around me and vice versa. The bar chairs were very comfortable and set up to maximize your comfort if you choose to eat at the bar.  This was the 2nd time I've eaten at this restaurant, but first time at the bar.   Started off with a beet salad and the carpaccio.  Both were very good.  Bernie recommended a white wine that was spot and paired extremely well with my apps.   For dinner me and my friend split the cherry pepper ribs, pork chop and spicy rigatoni.  The ribs, well we were told that they were from a pig.  No way. These ribs were from an elephant or a dinosaur.  I've never ever seen ribs this big in my life.  The size in and of itself had my eyes bulging out.  They tasted even better.  Cooked perfectly, very tender and the dry and wet rub combo had a perfect balance of sweet and slightly spicy.   The pork chop was cooked medium plus and came out perfectly. It was very tender and had a great moist flavor.  Combining pieces of the chop with the pickled peppers it came with gave an intense flavor.  The rigatoni was cooked perfectly and had great flavor with a light spicy-heat finish.  For dinner Bernie also recommended a red wine that has possibly changed my life (ok too dramatic, but seriously, what an amazing wine I discovered). It was Brunello Di Montacino 2010.  I've already called my local liquor store and reserved a bottle of it.  For dessert the carrot cake was like everything else, great.  Very moist, with great flavors of ginger, carrots and cream cheese. I can't wait to come back. In a town with insane competition, Great job Carbone.",

I wouldn't even call the dessert that I was served a tiramisu. It was basically just a layered cake with a Nutella topping. It tasted nothing like an actual tiramisu, and it wasn't even that good (the desserts st Jean Philippe down stairs are better, frankly). More so,  that this restaurant claims to be \"old school traditional Italian food\" as their brand, yet their tiramisu doesn't resemble the traditional Italian dessert whatsoever. Lame.  To summarize:  -1 star for not actually being tiramisu -1 star for not being True to the restaurant's brand -1 for the ridiculous price of $15 for a disappointing slice of generic layered cake",

    "text": "Absoluely agree with Feisty from Chicago. We found the place mediocre at best. Service was pleasant, but slow. If you are happy payiing $64 for Veal Parmigianna -- which comes with absolutely NOTHING else -- then this may be your place. And the Veal arrived \"barely\" luke warm, with the cheese on top unmelted. Really? Is the kitchen serious with this presentation? Our group found the food lacklustre, compared to MANY other Itlaian Restaurants we have visited in both Las Vegas & other communities. $28 for an appetizer portion of Linguine Vongole, which had precisely 6 SMALL clams on top. $17 for a chopped salad that was ONLY lettuce, radicchio, endive etc. They do provide a VERY TINY piece of Parmigiana cheese at the start of your meal --- perhaps, literally, 1 inch square ---- along with some excellent bread. At the end of the meal each guest gets a single 1 inch square piece of Italian wedding cake, & a shot of Limoncella. Big deal.  You will also have to do a LONG search on the wine list to find bottles under $100 --- lots in the $200-$400 & $1,000+ range. So glad we did not waste money on a higher priced wine, on the food we received. Will keep it to drinks at the bar, & never eat there again. Especially since the speakers in the dining room were turned up sooooooooooooo LOUD that it made conversation unpleasant. If high prices, mediocre food, & a loud environment are not objectionable, then I hope you enjoy.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying the food was VERY good and the service was very good as well. However, I am genuinely disappointed by the lack of communication from Management. When I booked online in the comment section I informed that the night we were dining was my wife's birthday and our 21st Wedding Anniversary (yes we got married on her birthday). I called a few days later to reconfirm the time of the reservation and asked the hostess if she say my note to which she replied yes. On the day of our reservation I received a call later afternoon asking if we still planned to dine there that night. My response was \"absolutely and we're very excited\". I again asked if they saw a note about birthday and anniversary to which once again the hostess replied \"Yup, I see it there\". So the long of the short-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING was done. No greeting-NOTHING. Let me be clear that I was not looking for something for nothing. It's my pleasure to buy my wife a $12 piece of cake I simply wanted an acknowledgement and at most a candle on the piece of cake. I was not looking for complimentary beverages or anything. Needless to say this was truly disappointing. I called the following day and spoke to a manger and expressed the embarrassment and disappointment. The Manager apologized and offered us a free dessert if we were to come in again. The obvious answer is I am not going to come spend upwards of $200 for a free piece of cake. I'm sorry Carbone but this was a one strike and you're out. I know I am a tiny fish to the multitudes that you are serving but you should know that as a local I will not be returning.",

Our dining captain started the evening by describing the menu and style of preparation and service. He made recommendations so we could dine family style and try all of the items we wanted. This was definitely a good way to go. Bread basket included a very well buttered garlic bread, crusty sesame Italian, and a soft tomato topped delight. Bread paired with pickled cauliflower and spicy salami. Cocktails were classically prepared - we enjoyed the Gibson, Manhattan, and White Lady. The wine list was impressive as well. Caesar salad table-side followed by the pasta course - Lasagna Verde served table-side and the Spicy Rigatoni. For the main course we chose the Veal Parmesan which seems to be a popular choice and did not disappoint. Our second entree was the Bass Alison, a lighter dish, baked which kept it juicy and flaky. All of this was shared four ways. We continued into desert, opting for the airy cheesecake topped with lemon curd. Now that we had been impressed and well fed, the gentleman who had been assisting our captain rolled the rum cart over. The two rum drinkers at our table chatted about the different rums and enjoyed their selections.",

The cheesy waiter \"Dave\" was making lame attempts at trying to impress us with his Italian pronunciation of the overpriced menu. He hung on the side of the booth, creepily crowding us while trying to up sell the already overpriced menu with split plates and other nonsense. We ordered some twisted pasta with spinach and some chicken dish (named after a shoe maker per Dave the waiter...wtf?!? A shoe maker famous for is chicken dish?) The small bowl of mush I received (think shallow cereal bowl overly priced at $27) was so overpowering with sherry wine and garlic it was inedible. About 12 minutes after the mush arrived, Manager Jaime walked by. We spoke about the creepy obese waiter \"Dave\" and how I was waiting over 15 minutes, at that point, without my chicken dish. Manager Jaime said she would not charge for the inedible food, or my meal which never arrived...now 20 minutes. Waiter \"Dave\" came out of the back of the restaurant (still without my food) and became slightly confrontational when he saw my GF, daughter and I leaving. I will never go back. Manager Jaime was great, that's why two stars, not one.  A restaurant having wait staff who act like cheesy obese used car salesmen have no place in a hotel that books their cheapest rooms for $400 per night.",

    "text": "Food and service were outstanding.  This is some of the best Italian food I've had in Las Vegas, BUT it comes at a very hefty price.  Only the value proposition and insanely loud music caused me to give this a 3 Star rating versus something higher.  Aria is a large convention casino/hotel with tons of people on expense accounts.  I get it that restaurants on the strip can charge up and get away with it, but some of the pricing at Carbone is frankly outrageous.    My only other criticism is that  with the music being so loud it was extremely difficult to carry on a conversation with our party of 5.  I like a lively, fun atmosphere and really dig the music selection, but I would equally like to be able to carry-on a conversation with my wife when we're spending over $150/per person for dinner.  While the food was memorable, I'm not sure I can highly recommend this place.  In my opinion, if you're willing to spend this kind of money go to Carnevino at The Venetian.  It's super expensive as well, but, in my opinion, a much better overall experience.  One last thing - skip the desserts.  They are underwhelming.",

Two waiters per table and the main waiter recommended we share plates, which I would NOT recommend. We shared baked clams, salad and the entree. The baked clams and salad came in timely manner, then only after my husband and I lost track of time, we realized that three tables seated AFTER us had received their entrees (one table had 8 people!) -- never once did our waiter refill our waters, they were actually avoiding us. He stopped by the table beside us twice and told them their entree was on the way out and then to serve their entree -- each time we tried to get his attention and he would run off. When he finally brought our entree (scallops...which is usually the quickest item to prepare), my husband asked him why it was delayed -- he gave a total BS answer and set the plate down, offered us a free drink and filled my wine glass  (my husband was drinking iced tea) and ran off...again. I understand delays happen in the kitchen, but all they needed to do was tell us there were delays, don't ignore the customers. I would not recommend this place at all. Save your money, better places in Vegas to eat or go NY and eat at the original location (where all old school Italian restaurants pride themselves on their service).",

    "text": "I was anxious to try this restaurant, so I made reservations one month in advance. I read other reviews online and I knew that the worst place to be seated would be the three (maybe four) tables for two on your way to the kitchen. To prevent this from happening, I called the restaurant right after I made the reservation to ask for the \"booths\" or the semi-private tables. I was told by the person on the phone that this would be \"noted\". My wife and arrived a little early to the restaurant and we asked if it was possible to be seated early. We were told that nothing was available until our time (which was 45 minutes away). My wife and I came back to the restaurant at our scheduled reservation time. Once we were brought to our seats I noticed that their were many vacant tables. The hostess seated us (guess where?) next to kitchen. When our waiter arrived we asked to be moved to one of several vacant booths. He told us that we had to make earlier arrangements to have one of the booths. I told him that we did and he said he would talk to \"someone\" about it. When he returned he proceeded to tell us their was nothing that anyone could do about it. We ordered our food. I really enjoyed the house salad. Also, they had a person cut chunks of cheese from a wheel. I thought that this was a great touch. We ordered the vodka pasta and the almond pesto pasta.  As I mentioned earlier there were several vacant tables (including the booths and semi-private tables) so I was a little surprised at their 35 minute ticket time for pasta. Once the pasta did arrive, I was shocked at over cooked and bland each of pasta dishes were. So, with the bad customer service and bad pasta, why would anyone want to waste their time with this restaurant? With all the wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas spend your time and money somewhere else. You'll be happy you did. Also, no one ever sat down in the vacant tables. Like I said before- bad customer service.",

Was looking around as we gave our order....never bothered to give us the specials (we heard that there were specials when he presented them to the table next to us) and he never came to check on us and ask about our food.  The food was ok, at best.  The prices were way too high for what we received.  And, trust me, we don't mind paying for good food (Gordon Ramsey at Paris the night before was over the top good).

The menu looks simple, but it's anything but that, and the wait staff are pros at directing you on what to order and how to order for your table. They're incredibly well trained and polite.  Make no mistake...we over-ordered and over-ate! It was amazing. Don't underestimate the garlic bread. Baked clams, scampi, caesar, spicy rigatoni and, oh, those chops!  Those chops!!  Also, best carrot cake I've ever had.  And, they bring you these little tri-colored cookies as a palate cleanser after the meal that look like the Italian flag and taste like love.  Also, although we ordered the scampi we were still bummed because we also wanted the shrimp su'modo...the waitress surprised us with a sampling!  Fantastic experience...I'd call it a can't miss if you're anywhere near Vegas.",

    "text": "Don't look at my review and the stars I gave as a result of the food that we ate. My wife and I live in Ohio and we visit Vegas 2-3 times a year. We love the nightlife and the food scene in Las Vegas.  When we visit, our favorite thing to do is eat at nice restaurants. My wife's good friend is a gm at a restaurant in the bellagio and she said carbone was highly recommended. Our night started by us sitting down and waiting 10 mins for a table touchdown from our server. We ended up ordering drinks right after we got the menus and those took 20 mins to get. That might be understandable for a fancy mixed drink, but not for a bourbon and a glass of wine. After we saw our server again when he brought our drinks, we ordered salads and our entrees. We also ordered meatballs for an appetizer that never showed up. The salads showed up after 30 minutes and the Caesar was unbelievable. It just shouldn't have taken that long. About 15 minutes after our salads were finished our waiter came over to let us know that we couldn't have the tortellini because it wasn't good that night. We had to change one of our entree orders, so that made it take another 30 mins for our food to come out. Once the entrees were delivered we were still missing our meatballs. When our waiter finally came back over and we asked, he said he would get them out to us as soon as he could. We told him to forget it and he said \"that's good, because I think we are out of them.\" Our dinner experience ended up turning into a 3 hour nightmare. The food was great, the service was just terrible. We talked to the manager when we were on our way out and she could have cared less. We would love to give carbone one more chance because the food was so good but I don't even know if it would be worth the time or money.",

Every detail about this place is nostalgic perfection from the glassware to the music playing. I'm Italian from east coast originally and I though this place brought back beautiful memories of flavor AND traditions. The food, the plates, the bread, the wine, all high quality and tastes super clean... The service was impeccable and we felt very special being there. Also I saw people complain about PRICE?! If you can't afford to be in one of the nicest hotels in Las Vegas then please go home or get drive thru. Carbone is epic! Ciao!",

We put ourselves in the hands of our captain for our first dining experience here and couldn't have been happier. Every course was on point from the caprese to the meatballs to the spicy rigatoni. The biggest winners were the sizzling pancetta (hard to not order a second course of this), the dover piccata (even the one person in the group who doesn't really eat fish had a second helping of this) and the corn tartufato (seriously, who puts truffle on corn - brilliant!). The sommelier picked a great wine as well, and the whole experience really could not have been improved upon.",

The bread basket is soooo good and as stuffed as we were we had to order a couple things because it smelled amazing.

    "text": "Where do we start? Decided to give this newest addition to Aria a try. We were not familiar with the place in New York so we had no particular expectations. Word on the street was it was excellent. Once we arrived and seated we were promptly greater by the service team. The head waiter walked us through the menu options and ordering concept. Once we discussed our culinary strategy, we decided to each start with chop salad for me and minestrone for my husband. Both were fabulous, the salad particularly delicious...I know...salad delicious...crazy.We moved them to the macaroni and choose the rigatoni to share. Be carful...it has a kick! Then we shared the lobster, my husband more than me because I was already feeling my limit. Wanted to save room for dessert and I am so glad I did. All the options were brought table side and described but it was the chocolate cake that won us over. Wow wee! It was so good. But hold on, that's not all. You also have the option to choose a rare rum or aperitif from the bar trolley and we were also treated to their house made limoncello.  I can't forget to mention the delicious varieties of breads served with antipasto assortment before our soup and salads. Again, ALL delicious. Ok so now you have something to nosh on regarding the good, I did not even touch on the restaurant and decor. I won't (but it had a vintage chic vibe) however I will suggest if you like to be where the action is, like the flurry of active coming and going from the kitchen, watching the bartenders mix up something wonderful, and the variety of guests (what's their story?) then sit in the front dining as we did . Lots of great \"entertainment\"",

Our waiter was pompous and unaccommodating, as dietary restrictions are a big deal, and they were unwilling to help with that.  And for all of this bad service, I had to pay an exorbitant tab, as a small drink, medium wine and fish split between two people added up to $360.  This kind of price is comparable to La Cirque or Picasso, but the food and service does not even come close to warranting the cost.",

However, we had six people and we ordered family style which reduced the number of dishes we ordered.   First they give you salami, bread, marinated cauliflower, and hunks of hard cheese to start.   For six I suggest two orders of the spicy rigatoni and two orders of meatballs for Apps, then we had three entrees.  The Ribs were unbelievable. The food was tremendous and to top it off they give you rainbow cookies and lemonchello to finish your experience.",

I also here that a lot of the native New Yorkers come to Vegas to eat at Carbone because they can't at home.  So I was pretty impressed with the food. Must haves are the baked clams, meatballs, lobster ravioli. to name a few. The wine list was impressive, Great list of italian wines. The service was also great. Issue that stopped me from going to 5 stars. I got stuck at a table with a fake plant drooping over me. Did not like that much. I also found out after our dinner that there is a much nicer dinning room in the back. You have to ask to be sat there when you make your reservation. As far as italian restaurants go in Vegas this is a must visit. Just don't forget to ask for the dining room. I will be back.",

I loved everything about this place, the ambiance, the uniforms, food, and even the table I was sitting at. I went with one other person and was seated at an intimate booth, and it was perfect (a little small for all the food we ordered). They anticipated my every need, and I got exactly what I paid for. Carbone is a pricey place which is expected on the strip, but well worth the money I would say. I love Italian food, and I've traveled to Italy just for Italian food, but I must say their pasta is the closest to perfect I've had in Vegas. Let me begin with the caesars salad; it was the best salad I have ever had (I understand I am saying this a lot, but I am not exaggerating). The server came and made the salad table side with fresh parmesan and fresh ingredients, that's just the beginning. Next came our main course, I am not going to mention anything other than the pasta that we had because it was pure perfection (Please don't waste your experience by ordering a steak here, go to Jean George for that). All of their pasta dishes, which we ordered, was authentic and delicious. I am impressed as ever and couldn't help but rave about this place. I was too full for dessert, but I am sure that it would be just as perfect as the main course. Try the cream corn with truffle too, that was to die for.  I hope this review helps and encourages everyone to give this place a try.",

Apparently, this order goes way back to the Carbone in New York City and you can just order the #1 and the waiters will know exactly what you want.  The complimentary bread was delicious, particularly the tomato foccacia, as was the spicy salami.  We were too stuff for dessert but did enjoy the post-dinner house made Limoncello along with a 3-color cookie.  The total bill, including tip, was around $150-$175 for two people so it's not cheap but is worth the price.  The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing and added a nice touch by asking if we had any plans for the evening so the pacing of the meal would be ideal.  I'd recommend Carbone for special occasions.  Also, make sure to grab some of the Italian candies on the way out.  They're delicious.",

I've been to places with a smaller variety of vegetarian foods so the lower rating isn't for the lack of variety. But for the lack of flavors.  I love beets and I know my beets. The perfect beet salad actually doesn't need a whole lot of dressing if the produce is high quality. Their beet salad was doused in oil, and the flavors just didn't sing. Also the beets lacked the wholesome earthiness... I kept searching for flavor without much luck.  For my main, I had the spicy rigatoni vodka. It was good but I've had better. The pasta was cooked inconsistently and the sauce was just ok.  For the price of the meal, I expected to walk away more in awe of the food. Even though I am a vegetarian. That shouldn't be a cop out. My husband loved it - and I'm sure the seafood and meats were delicious. I was disappointed.",

Recommended the Caesar salad and probably the best caprese salad I have ever had. Meatball were great. New York strip steak was only okay.  Would recommend to anyone staying at the aria.",

    "text": "O. M. G. our neighbors said we had to try it and raved about the limoncello - they didn't mention the amazing food! I had my heart set on the veal parm since every picture I saw about this place had that but the waiter suggested we go another route, he suggested we share starters and have our own entress - we love to course meals so this worked perfect. FIRST, they bring you some items to snack on before you even order. Fresh parm, pickled veggies, salumi...all yum... BUT the carpaccio, the CARPACCIO - truly to die for. Best I've ever had, it's a bit different but fantastic nonetheless. Next, at the waiters suggestion, we had the spicy rigatoni vodka - perfectly al dente, great flavor-a simple dish yet so delightful! My Mrs had the lobster ravioli and raved, I opt'd for the veal marsala (GREAT suggestion from our amazing waiter), it's the most unique version I've ever had-chargrilled amazing-ness. While this is not an inexpensive restaurant it doesn't break the bank. It's definitely a phenomenal experience as a whole and the food lived past our expectations. Lastly, the cookies and housemade limoncello arrives.... what a fantastic way to end the meal, pouring as you want from the bottle they leave on the table and leisurely finishing your meal. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!",

    "text": "Carbone is a full on dining experience. The layout of the restaurant is quite unique with booths that surround the edges of the dining room and are also beautifully intertwined in the middle so it's intimate. The music is clearly hand picked and it brings a great energy to the restaurant.  The service is 5 stars all the way and your \"captain\" will ensure you have a great experience, not just a great meal.  They have a very extensive wine and cocktail list and I'd highly recommend the Manhattan which has a hint of cinnamon. Their Mai Tai comes with a chilled metal straw. Just another added detail that puts things over the top.  The carpaccio is the best I've ever had. Ever. The shaved truffles put it into a whole new category but just a warning, those shavings aren't cheap!  The ribeye also the best I've ever had. Although it's grilled on charcoal, it's like it was seared in a cast iron pan that was infused with flavor from over a hundred years of cooking. It was that good! You might not think to order steak at an Italian restaurant but if you are a steak lover, it's a must.  The lemon cheesecake is quite unique. It's not super dense like most cheesecakes. It's light and creamy with a velvety texture which is melt in your mouth delicious!   Can't wait to go back! Highly recommend.",

I asked for the wine list to chose a bottle to get decanted to have with dinner. After a few moments the sommelier (Juan) came over and we had a delightful conversation and chose our wine and I was decanted in front of me and we chatted about both of our recent trips to Italy. We had a beautiful table and our server was A+ as well. The caprice salad with the fresh pulled mozzarella was over the top. The rigatoni and meatball was perfect. Loved the langoustine too was tasty.  The pork chop...wow! I recommend this gem, it's not inexpensive but you do get what you pay for.",

    "text": "So good. So good. So good. Best Italian I've had yet. I went with three friends and they each agreed that every course was just amazing.   I was a bit nervous trying a place with no reviews, but I am so glad I did. We went to Mon Ami Gabi last night at Paris, which was extremely underwhelming so as a first timer in Vegas I was beginning to think Vegas was all hype. I am so glad I was wrong.  We arrived early for our reservation and were promptly take to a lounge area where we were able to order drinks. We were sat at a table shortly after. The bread basket comes with a traditional loaf, \"pizza\" bread, and garlic bread, each very good with the garlic bread taking home gold. We ordered 3 Caesar salads and one chopped.  The Caesars were prepared table-side dressing and all; we all agreed the croutons were the best we'd ever had. I think it's the best Caesar I've ever had. At this point we were all full - and we still had meatballs and pasta coming. The Spicy Rigatoni Vodka was just amazing. The pasta portions are smaller than you would expect but with all of the bread and the salad it was just right. I was able to try the Tortellini Ragu as well, which was very good but had nothing on the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. The two others also enjoyed theirs dishes.  I will for sure be back at Carbone if I am ever back in Vegas.   Oh, the drinks we tried were on point too! My amaretto sour was made using egg whites with gives it that lovely foam on top, and the men enjoyed their traditional Old Fashioneds.   Go here! No more discussions!",

The handmade pasta is awesome. The sauces were good, nothing worth raving about, but the pasta itself was great. The bread is also sooo goood! Cool bar Inside Aria   Cons: We were a party of 7 and waited 20 mins with reservations. Not a huge con but didnt exactly make us happy.  The food overall is not up to Las Vegas or New York standards, especially for Italian food. Well its actually American Italian food. I will never eat at Carbone again for this reason: Vegas has so many great Italian restaurants and this one doesnt come close.  Expensive!!! Especially for what you get.",

They were very agressive when i claimed my fendi shopping bag which i had put it under my table and they didnt want to accept to view the cameras and made a stupid excuse like the cameras dont take all the angles of the restaurant and even the head of security didnt care and didnt help!!!! they just said we didnt see it.  what an awful experience!! wouldnt recommend anyone to go there cause you ate not safe while eating there.",

    "text": "This Italian place was highly recommended by a friend who knows food and we came here full of excitement! We were sited at a huge booth, that would sit at min 6 and possibly 8 people.  Forgot to mention, I called the restaurant before we came and asked if they had langoustines, after I was placed on a brief hold I was told that I am in luck and they have them. When we got to our table and a very energetic waiter came to greet us I asked about langoustines and was told that they don't have any.... We ordered drinking and appetizers.... the aged cheese and bread were provided by the restaurant, and w lovely Caesar Salad ( made at the table), really tasty octopus ( highly recommend)  and baked clams ( tasty) we had began our celebration. When you read comments of people who say that portions are huge and there is some to take home, please keep in mind they are referring to the least expansive pasta dishes... I have seen them being served to other table and they were huge. The best dish for main course was ordered by the birthday girl ( thankfully) and it was lobster ravioli. They were delicious and we all enjoyed a little taste of it. My husband orders seafood stew.... the red sauce was overwhelming and killed the taste of all the seafood. The rest of us ( 2) ordered shrimp scampi and side of cream of corn w truffles. The shrimps were gigantic and that is all I can say about them.... there was barely any sauce and they would have been way better served chilled w cocktail sauce. Years ago I had shrimp scampi at Cheesecake Factory and I have to say, they were way better... There was no panacota  ( Italian desert that was on the menu, but not available), so we left after the main course. I was not impressed w most of the food and the bill was over $500.00 One could say, you knew it was a $$$$ restaurant. I agree and would have never mention the money, if the food would worse it. Here at Carbone, Aria, it did not worse it.... Check out Scarpetta and my review of it :)",

    "text": "I went into my dinner reservation, excited and happy to be celebrating my birthday there. However, it was quickly short lived. Our waiter was horrible. He was short, rude and not attentive at all. I can't rember his full name but I know it started with a D. The second waiter was great and quick. But not our main one in the burgundy coat. When he came over for our order he was short and did not even ask if we were going to have any drinks (let's not forget it's was a birthday dinner) We had to call him back for drinks. At one point my boyfriend went over to let him know it was my birthday and he turned to him and said \"I know\" and that was it. Didn't bother to ask him if we would want a specific dessert or anything, so we assumed the slice of cake (it was chocolate, which I'm not a big fan of) we got was not charged. However, to our surprise it was on the bill. Would have been great to pick what we would have liked since we paid for it. He also never asked if we would have liked coffee with our dessert, which we did want. When the bill came it had already been a while since we had not seen him. When he did come back to pick up the signed bill the first thing he did was open it in front of us, as if to look for his tip. So rude! I left the dinner sad and upset about the service I received, so I decided to write to the management since I go to Vegas a lot and thought maybe they would make it up since the place isn't cheap... BUT to my surprise it was worse! They wrote back to me and apologized then asked me what they could do to make it up to me. REALLY? DO I really need to tell you how to do a service recovery? I mean at the minimum let me know that the next time I come in my dessert would be comped. Very disappointed with the entire experience.",

    "text": "\"Last table left in Carbone\" -Drake   So maybe we didn't get the last table, but we did get a nice semi-circle booth with the plush red velvet cushions :) Deion (sp?) was our waiter and he was exceptional. I think the wait staff has the ability to make or break your dining experience and he made sure ours was soaring into the clouds. The way he described all of the food made you feel like if you didn't order exactly what he recommended you were missing out on the meal of a lifetime. So I will say that I am glad we took him up on all of his suggestions and enjoyed just that - a truly exquisite meal that I won't soon forget.  We ordered the beef carpaccio with arugula, sliced mushrooms and truffle oil as an appetizer. Then we had the spicy rigatoni vodka with a housemade meatball* (pro-tip: not on the menu!) For the entree we had the special, which was fresh sole flown in from Holland, de-boned and filleted at the table with a lemon butter caper sauce. As a side we had truffle creamed corn with parmesan. For dessert we indulged in the bananas foster which was flambeed table-side (because why wouldn't it be?) but somehow the overwhelming flavor was still drenched in 151. Even with that minor mishap, I can't take off a star because I truly felt the rest of the food was THAT good.  Was it pricey? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Would I go again? For a special occasion :)",

    "text": "We went to Carbone for my husband's birthday.  We were very surprised by the treatment we received.  We were served water but and offered wine.  We turned down the wine as I was in pain medication but neither of us were offered anything else to drink.  My husband had a Manhattan earlier and was hoping for a second one. We were never asked again.  As soon as we waved off the wine,  the staff weren't interested in serving us and were very rude.   At first, we actually wondered if they were specifically trained for the sheer rudeness.    The busboy made a point to explain why the wine is 600% more because of the $7 millions dining room renovation.  Wow.  When you are a sommelier,  you didn't need the extra knowledge on wine costs at a restaurant,  but you definitely got the hint that alcohol was where their money was.  When the waiter finally came to our table,  he asked what we wanted. He did not offer other drinks, specials,  or explain the menu options or descriptions that all other restaurants do.  It was like being served by Lurch from the Adam's family.  Ordered minestrone and Caesar salad.  Lovely table side presentation of the salad but when placed down,  declined additional anchovies,  yet he left them to sit in front of me even after he removed my salad plate.  I got to see the fish all the way through and after dinner.  No seasonings of salt or pepper were to be found on table.  Still,  our waiter could not be flagged down by us.  Very few words were spoken to us.  We were never asked anything other than what we wanted in the menu.  Meanwhile,  Lurch was having a good ole time laughing it up at the crowded table of guests behind us as he spent all his time there serving wine and later after dinner drinks.  The music was so loud that the Busboy got right up in my ear and yelled  \"everything ok?\" when our dinner was served.    I ordered lobster ravioli.  I was surprised to see that the Lobster was on outside of ravioli.  Squid black in color for the ravioli.  It was tough as if undercooked and aldenti.  We could not get a hold of our waiter at all to tell him. The Lobster Fra Diavlo my husband orders was tasty,  but no spice whatsoever.  The description of the name of the dish implies spice.  No heat as all. Still couldn't find someone to ask for some pepper.    When the bill arrived,  we had three drinks added on our menu that were not ours.  Once fixed,  round 2 the bill reflected a $16 double rye plus $3 for a manhattan bump.  The house Manhattan that was ordered was $17.  After asking that,  he went back again to correct the receipt.    The Lobster Fra Diavlo was $95.  My dinner $39.   Not worth it.   Our table was cleared except for the anchovies still and we were done after the lack of service.  They brought us two cookies,  one broken, as a token and we left.     It's a shame that we were treated so terribly.  We spent close over $1500 on a family dinner at the Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse the night before and had the best time.  We were there for our four hours.  We were expecting a similar experience.  Instead,  we felt insulted.  We asked for the manager but he was too busy to come by.  After waiting awhile, we left.  Sad.",

    "text": "First trip to Vegas in about 14 years. I am a big foodie but am absolutely overwhelmed by how many choices for fine dining in Vegas. Even with reading reviews or speaking to people you can't seem to get a solid consensus of which are the can't miss places being there are so many choices. We had originally made a reservation at B&B Ristorante but after being totally jet lagged from flying in we decided on Carbone since we are staying at Aria.  The Atmosphere is really nice, very classy design as well as good sound insulation. Service was great as well. They start off by bringing you some sharp provolone and bread which was fresh and cheese was great tasting. We shared the chopped salad which was excellent. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli $39.00 entree and I had Penne Vodka $28. 00. My wife's lobster ravioli was very fishy but she enjoyed the flavor of the sauce it was Cooked in. My penne alla  vodka was well penne alla vodka. Nothing special. We are prob a little tainted because we are from NY and have so many good choices for Italian but overall the food was good not great but not worth the price. 1 Chopped salad, penne vodka, lobster ravioli, 4 glasses of wine came to $195.00  One note I might add. They have a very extensive wine list. That being said they really have almost no options in the 80 to 150 a bottle price range. There is 300 to 400 percent mark up on almost all wines.",

The server also brought out a whole complimentary bottle of lemon liqueur after our dessert. I'm pretty sure I could have gotten drunk from it, but I decided to have only one glass.

    "text": "Carbone is like a set piece stuck in the Goodfellas universe and I'm not mad about it.    My fiance and I had reservations for 9pm on a Friday, we got there early and sat at the bar. They have a great bar space with an amazing cocktail menu and great selection of wines and whiskies. After ordering drinks and a snack-a-tizer, we were informed that our table was ready early, nice!   Just a heads up, before you order an appetizer wait until the pepperoni and bread plates arrive and then decide if more snacking foods will be in your future, because these plates of meats and cheeses are so delicious will take every ounce of your \"goomba\" willpower not to eat it all. We didn't know this and ordered an appetizer at the bar which, when placed on the table along with the pepperoni and breads, makes it look like a commercial to hype up foodie tourism to Sicily or South Jersey.    We went with the \"Prosciutto and Mozz\" to start and it was incredible, the mozzarella comes out hot and is cut with scissors right in front front of you, truly old school. You get three types of prosciutto, and they are all great. Salty, spicy, paper thin and not too greasy.   After the orgy of spiced cured meats, breads, and cheese came to an end it was finally time to eat dinner. My fiance and I split our meals, first up was the Tortellini Ragu, handmade pasta stuffed with ricotta and swimming in a rich Bolognese sauce. I personally loved the tortellini, but my fiance wasn't a fan, it was cooked perfect just past the point of being under so the pasta was still firm with small snap and the Bolognese \"fugget about it\" If could, I would have asked for a glass of the stuff to sip on afterwards.   Next up was the Veal Marsala, which we also shared; they brought it fully carved tongs in tow, so we could just serve ourselves. This was like butta, tender, juicy and with only a slim hint of guilt as I indulged in this tasty meal. The mushrooms, fantastic, the marsala sauce, again it was drinkable.   Throughout the entire night, the service was on point and the timing between meals was almost mechanical, it was just that good. No egg noodles and ketchup here, just pure New York Italian food.",

The service was incredible - our server guided us through the menu, recommended splitting a bunch of dishes (and even split the bowls of pasta into equal portions for us all to try at no extra charge), and tended to our needs without being overbearing. The food, as always, was incredible. We ordered the tableside caesar salad (so garlicky and delicious - the croutons are insane!), then split 4 portions of the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka between the 8 of us, and the Chicken Massimo (which was chicken in a balsamic glaze) with a side of grilled asparagus. They bring out complimentary meats, cheese, and an amazing bread basket in the beginning of the meal, and traditional italian rainbow cookies and Limoncello at the end of the meal - also complimentary. I love Carbone and can't wait to go back.",

The food was delicious, the service from the busser was impeccable, our server was our biggest issue. He was very pushy on selling us the nights specials, as well as getting our drink orders right when we got there. We told him we needed a minute to look over the menu, and by the time he came back to order he took the cocktail menu from us.   Personally, I pair my drinks with what I am going to eat to compliment each other (how strange). I think he had in his mind we weren't going to buy drinks so he just stopped checking on us all together. Literally! We were constantly checking with other servers for assistance. After over two hours of being there, we waited..and waited... for the check that never came. To the point where we were walking to the front of the doors to pay there, and they were telling us have a good night.. No... we are trying to pay for our bill, and we have waited almost forty minutes.. we just wanted us to pay to leave and they insisted on us sitting back at our table..  The manager I believe stopped by? She apologized, and a different server came and gave us a drink from the bar on the house.. It was like a lemon vodka, that was too strong.. and I am not sure if he meant to but he left the whole bottle on the table with us. Not my idea of fixing the issue, but that's just me, since we just wanted the check to leave. We didn't even finish the drinks that were poured or the bottle. It was just a strange experience, that I didn't expect especially based off of everyone's reviews. I was let down mostly because it was our date night and and we don't always get to spend time together and this is where we chose to spend it.",

The octopus was delicious and the caprese was some of the best I had. The rigatoni was stunning it was so good. As we went on to are entree's I was already amazed by the food. Even though being in an Italian restaurant I decided to order the Prime Porterhouse which I shared with a friend. It was great the filet Migmin was extremely flavorful and the NY strip was even better. I tried some lobster which was seasoned. I was not a fan but the rest of my table disagreed.

    "text": "Restaurants and tastes and service are subjective but I must say I was really looking forward to eating at Carbone and I had an exceptional experience here.  The NYC West Village location has been on my radar for a bit and I've missed it the last two times I was in NYC. I was on a solo work trip to Vegas and figured hey, why not? I walked in just after 5 and asked if they had room for 1 with no reservation and they sat me two minutes later.  The dining room is pretty swanky. Huge chandelier, low lighting, burgundy velvet covered booths, waiters walking around in burgundy tuxedos, some private dimly lit booths, tall gold banquettes for privacy, crisp white tablecloths, etc. I'm not sure if it's old New York or old Las Vegas but it works! They brought the bread service while I was looking over the menu.  A plate of salami, a dish of pickled cauliflower with red onions, and the bread which was plain bread, a slice of tomato focaccia, and a slice of cheese garlic bread.  Best bites here were the acidic red onions in the cauliflower, the garlic bread which I could have eaten a whole loaf of and the tomato focaccia.  The focaccia tasted like it had been finished with fleur de sel and the little touch of salt with the fresh bread and tomato was perfection.  I started with the Insalata di mare.  This was a very delicately dressed seafood salad inside red leaf lettuce.  There was shrimp, scallops, calamari, etc.  This was light and excellent.  My one complaint of the evening was I believe the scallops should have been washed more thoroughly.  There was the slightest bit of grit.  For dinner I chose the Spicy Rigatoni, which is what Carbone is known for.  If you read my reviews regularly you know I'm always game for Vodka sauce! This was really delicious. Perfectly cooked pasta and a tangy creamy sauce.  For me it could have been spicier but it was really nicely done.  The waiter brought over the dessert cart which I would have loved to order from but I was too full.  The complimentary rainbow cookies after the meal were the perfect little treat though.  The service was impeccable and, for me, Carbone hit it out of the park.  One of the best meals I've had in 2019.",

In addition, he made me a great Manhatten, probably one of the best I've ever had.   The food was simply amazing. I really love Italian food because with simple quality ingredients you can really make the dish taste absolutely to die for.

It was like he was avoiding us for some reason and not sure why. The garlic bread. Omg the garlic bread. I could probably eat a whole basket of just that.   I came here looking forward to the pasta with vodka sauce. It was alright. I think I had way high expectations.  Clams - yummmmm!   Scallops - I'm not a fan of scallops and my husband thought they were okay and nothing special.  We had the banana ice cream flambe thing. I really just got it for the experience. Lol.  Nice ambience. Expensive food for what it is. We'd probably go to other places instead the next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Carbone is absolutely perfect. Everyone that works there is the utmost professional--friendly, appropriately attentive, hospital, and most of all NOT judgmental (I look really young for my age and tend to not get the best service at fine dining). I don't often tip more than 20% but it felt necessary here.  The food is exactly my type too. \"Fine dining\" in the sense that the ingredients are of the highest quality and the composition is sophisticated, but warm and comforting in presentation (feels more like a family dinner). The best example of this is the Caesar salad--a dish that you cant possibly imagine as special but somehow, someway they make it special and unforgettable.  The spicy rigatoni is also to die for--their specialty pasta is just delectable. Really can't go wrong with anything here!  Would love to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow. What a fantastic meal. We sat down and were in a rush for a flight and the staff could not have been more accommodating.   Part 1: the bread...fantastic. The garlic bread is not overly garlic and perfectly crunchy. The tomato bread is also fantastic. The wine was also reasonably priced and very solid.   Part 2: for a starter we ordered the prosciutto with mozzarella and the Caesar salad. The prosciutto dish was solid. Above average but not spectacular. The Caesar on the other hand was out of this world. Whole lettuce leaves perfectly dressed with dressing and homemade croutons that are somehow soft and crunchy at the same time. Truly a work of art.   Part 3: for the main course we split the veal parmigiana, spicy rigatoni and the meatballs. Everything was fantastic, but the star of the show was definitely the spicy rigatoni. It was creamy but not too creamy. Spicy but not too spicy. A perfect dish anyway you slice it!  Would definitely recommend making Carbone at the Aria a part of any trip to Las Vegas. Better than the one in New York I dare say...",

Hard to recreate the nyc location in Vegas, but this was still great in a different way. Felt more commercialized but food was definitely still great  Went with a bottle of an antinori badia a passignano, which isn't always easy to find on a restaurant menu. My group split a Caesar salad and tuna carpaccio special to start. Caesar was made table side and the tuna was phenomenal with a eggplant mousse. Next course was a meatball each with spicy rigatoni. Spicy rigatoni is an absolute must and the meatball complemented it well! For an entree, we split the pork chop (no bone) with roasted peppers and duck fat potatoes.....both were just WOW! Fantastic meal and great service. Couldn't have asked for more!",

We also had the FETTUCCINE CON FUNGHI (a little bland compared to the rigatoni) and the special fish of the night which was served with 3 sauces for you to choice.   The reason for the 3 stars was the service. The service started out excellent but when a larger party came in our server left us waiting over 30 minutes before he even came over to start our  desert table side and never once apologized for keeping us waiting. We ended up not getting the desert and leaving. For a place like this I expect a little more when it come to service.",

The place echos so it was louder than I expected. The service was very good, our waiter helped us pick a good wine. He also encouraged us to order several courses and wasn't too disappointed when we only ordered 2 (plus a dessert later on).   The tomatoes and mozzarella was very good but not exceptional.  The spicy rigatoni was awesome but rich (I was glad I didn't have another course coming). The tiramisu was also very good but not exceptional.",

    "text": "From the complimentary bread to the entrees, I was fully satisfied with every dish. There were 3 kinds of bread and I disliked the sesame crunchy bread(not sure why it's crunchy). It's great to be given complimentary garlic bread and tomato/pizza like bread. Those were good. They also give you chunks of cheese(if they don't give it to you, ask for it. Do it). They also give you complimentary salami(love) and the pickled cauliflower which I also love.   I would say their CARPACCIO PIEMONTESE* was definitely one of the best I've had. It's seasoned so well and although it's super thinly sliced(capraccio style), the little mushroom and truffle would gives you that punch of flavor + it's really good beef. Definitely recommend everybody to get this.  Spicy Rigatoni Vodka - it sounds so plain and there's not even any proteins so why listen to your waiter when they say that this is one of their dishes they're known for. Get it and find out because although it's just sauce, pasta, and cheese, it's SUPER delicious. Honestly, even the presentation looks super simply and meh but when you taste it, it's just so damn good. Idk how they do it but there's enough sauce and cheese for each rigatoni. You know how you usually order a pasta and even if you mix it, some part of it just doesn't seem to have the right amount of sauce and cheese but yea it's portion perfectly well. Really idk how I can describe it to you to make you get this dish but it's damn delicious.  Lobster Ravioli - Even though , if I had to switch up a dish it would be this lobster ravioli but it was still very good. The sauce is amazing and what's not to love about having lobster chunks outside the ravioli AND INSIDE of  the ravioli. The aroma coming from this dish makes you drool.   Veal Marsala - if you're not a veal fan, you should consider giving it a try here. Their marsala sauce is a litter more sweeter and richer than your typical marsala sauce. I've come up with theory that they prob use better wine for this sauce but that's just my opinion. This is one of the things theyre known for and rightfully so. The meat was tender and the sauce is a great pairing. I usually don't go devour a bone like that but I admit, there was no trace of meat left after.  POTATOES LOUIE - Like damn, duck fat with potato. The duck fat oil's aroma is so drooling, it drives me crazy. For a side dish to pair with your entrees, it seriously was surprising by how much potatoes there were. I would say it's the weakest dish, but I never had any potato style dish like this. It's the weakest dish but it's just a side and I thought it was kinda bang for the buck. It helped me get full and i've heard of mash potatoes, potato puree, potato scallop but never have I ever had this. By weakest dish and so, I've loved every single dish in their own way.  Service was great. I would definitely come back. A perfect combination of having Bardot for brunch and Carbone for dinner is probably one of the best thing you can imagine.",

All the servers and hosts are dressed sharply and very attentive.  Started off with a bottle of wine. They have an array of wine options by the glass, half bottle, or bottle. They start you off with some cheese and a basket of bread. There are three different types of bread that are amazingly delicious. The they offer you complimentary slant and pickled cauliflower.  For dinner, we got a chopped salad which was so yummy and light. We also got the rigatoni which is a must!!! For my main dish I got the cauliflower steak which was okay. I probably wouldn't order it again.  All in all it was a great experience and fantastic food. Looking forward to coming here again.",

    "text": "New favorite restaurant in Vegas! I had the pleasure of dining at Carbone last night and was blown away by the service, atmosphere, food and wine list. I was lucky enough to be dining with a Carbone veteran so he did the ordering for the table.   Started with the complimentary Parmesan, salami and bread basket with pizza bread and garlic bread. Worth every carb and calorie. The waitress also brought out the huge nuggets of white truffle for us to view, which I will be dreaming about. We started with the delicious beet salad and grilled octopus. Not the best I've ever had or the stars of the show, but very good. Then we had the baked clams, wow! Such great flavors, not too much panko, big meaty clams, a bit of lemon.  Second course was my favorite, the pasta. We each had the legendary spicy rigatoni vodka and split the lobster ravioli for the table. That spicy rigatoni might be my favorite pasta dish ever. The pasta is so perfectly cooked but also melts in your mouth. The sauce clings to the pasta like you wouldn't believe. It's magical. Lobster ravioli was also 5/5, huge pieces of lobster with great flavors.  Then we had the grilled prawns, sirloin, veal Parmesan and potatoes in duck fat. Ah! Everything was out of this world. Standouts in that course were veal Parmesan and the potatoes. Last but not least, we finished with bananas foster, the best cheesecake I've had outside of New York and excellent carrot cake. Needless to say, I'm still full from this dinner.  The atmosphere and service deserve 5 stars as well, because it was one of those moments where you look around and say this is how dining out should be. Thank you Carbone, I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The food was good, but ... the experience was loathsome ... and kind of sad. I think this place was designed for men in their 20s who just don't know any better. I mean, it's supposed to recreate 1958, but we were seated under a speaker blaring mid-1960s pop music. That was our first clue that something's just ... off about this place.   Here are some other highlights:  The \"captain\" said he'd tell us the price of the specials, but only if we were interested in ordering them. Very classy.   He repeatedly described small portions as \"designed for sharing\". (And why would a plate of rigatoni be a signature dish? Everybody's nonna brings a tray of rigatoni to pot lucks and picnics. Nothing special about Carbone's rigatoni that would differentiate it from nonna's. Except the price, obviously.)  The wines were priced a little higher higher than any other Vegas restaurant.   The restaurant drops a lot of complimentary snacks on the table while you wait. It's not a ... bad thing, but everything is heavy and spicy, while some of the main courses are delicately flavored and are overpowered by the pizza bread and salami and chunks of cheese and pickled cauliflower.   The \"captain\" didn't offer us any limoncello, either, but he probably figured we wanted to get out of there and would stiff him on the tip. We did NOT, as this mess of a place is not entirely his fault.   The food was way overpriced. Similar dishes at other high-end Italian restaurants -- with less-muddled concepts -- are less expensive, and the experiences have never made me want to get up and leave.",

I asked for a second bread basket and it was brought out quickly. We shared the ribeye Diana and the spicy rigatoni vodka. It was so good!!!!! The ribeye was very flavorful and very italian-y in spices. The pasta was so good. My husband and I are not very big people so I do believe we ordered too much food. It broke my heart to leave half the ribeye on the plate as we had 1. No more room in our stomachs and 2. Had to leave to catch the show on time. Next time, we will probably order 2 appetizers and 2 pastas. That would be the perfect amount of food. Danny and Eric were great waiters!",

    "text": "Captain.... What Captain??  I went to Carbone on a Saturday night around 830. We had a reservation. It was busy but not too crazy. Waited about 15 minutes then our party of 11 was sat.  Then we waited for another 10 minutes and a server assistant came by for the drink order. We all order cocktails as we we're celebrating a birthday. The drinks took about 15 minutes to come to the table. We have been there 30 minutes and NO CAPTAIN yet. Finally here he comes... He starts telling us the specials and most of the 11 could not understand / hear him. Then he starts taking orders. After several questions and people ordering he is gone.  I ordered veal Parmesan and my wife ordered branzino. The captain says he's not sure if they have it and has to go ask. He disappeared for 5 minutes and returned. No problem we can order branzino. One of our guests never got to order his meal. Then we wait. We all were ready for more drinks... Nothing... Waited some more. We asked for bread several times. No bread. About 20 min later the apps arrive. Our guest that didn't order placed his order at this time. Food was delicious. And we could order our second cocktails. STILL NO BREAD.  Then captain returns to tell one of the guests they DID NOT HAVE LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE.  So he orders something else. About 20 more minutes go by and we still have NO BREAD. The captain returns to tell my wife they have NO BRANZINO.  At this point we are very upset. We asked to talk to the manager. She came by apologized and said she would bring bread right out. We have now been there for about an hour and a half. I noticed another table of 5 that sat down right as we did is paying the check. They already had dessert. By now the restaurant is clearing out. It is after 10:20. We did not get entrees for another 20 minutes and they FORGOT ALL OF THE SIDES WE HAD ORDERED. This review is getting long so I'll wrap it up. DINNER TOOK OVER 3 HOURS. Service was the worst we've had EVER!!  CHECK WAS $955 after they comped off a bunch of drinks , free desserts , and comped some food.  STILL FELT LIKE IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. I WILL NOT RETURN. NONE OF IS WILL. THIS WAS A TABLE FULL OF BUSINESS REPS WHO WILL NOT RETURN. Who would subject their clientele to this. One star because zero is not an option.",

The atmosphere and presentations were warm and cozy. The food was average and my review is largely based on the conceited service that Carbone apparently upholds. The cherry pepper ribs have a wonderful flavor though the ribs themselves are incredibly tough.  I ordered a pasta dish for my parents and requested it to be well done rather than al dente as they have difficulty chewing and was told by the server that he will not offend the chef by making such a request.  We have spent countless months traveling the villages and cities of Italy and always requested softer well done pasta for my parents to be able to enjoy. Clearly Carbone is well off enough to refuse to serve patrons in an accommodating fashion. The tourists may keep this place going.  As a local, I will not dine here again. Shameful.",

First the food took over an hour to show up at our table, the restaurant was not even 3/4 full so how could it take so long for the food to come out! We wanted to order wine so my brother was talking to the Sommelier and they just kept steering him towards the most expensive wine on the menu. Come on people just because we are not wine experts does not mean we do not know about wine! when the food arrived the waiter served one serving of lasagna  and walked away. what about the rest of us we want lasagna as well? I don't mind paying for a good meal but if the service sucks it just ruins the rest of the experience.",

    "text": "Overpriced and under delivered.    Where to start?  Perhaps with the fact that the question \"flat or sparkling\" doesn't include a tap water offering.  Instead, flat water is bottles and bottles of Fiji water straight out of the unscrewed Fiji plastic bottles. . Forget whether the price is worth it, how about not trucking water halfway across the planet in plastic bottles?  Fiji is about as far from Italy as Las Vegas, so it is just pure pretension.  Serving it directly from the plastic bottles is kind of the perfect metaphor for this place.  yeah, I get that you want us to be impressed that you are pouring Fiji water. Just like we can buy at the gas station.  The bread basket is impressive looking but about one notch above Olive Garden.  The minestrone soup (at $20/bowl) is artfully presented but lukewarm and utterly flavorless.  Every single person in our group tried - and panned -  the soup. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said he never recommends the soup.  Thanks for not steering us away from it.    The wine list is impressive, but with the least expensive bottle being in the mid $80 range for wines that retail at mid $30s the markup on the bottles is ridiculous bordering on insulting. No, i take that back. It IS insulting.  Standard markup at restaurant is 200% guys.  Not 300% or more. The cheapest by-the-glass wine is $16 a glass for a bottle that retails for less than $30. Wines are not 300% better just because they are poured here. If you come expecting to order a bottle of wine with dinner plan on spending at least $100 and that doesn't get you many options.       Octopus appetizer is mediocre. The rigatoni was delicious, but I would expect delicious rigatoni at a high-end Italian place. Porterhouse steak was great, but nothing a high-end steakhouse wouldn't serve. The unbelivablly large shrimp were impressive to see, but basically just a grilled shimp. The chicken was probably the most impressive meat - very juicy and tender.  Service was not up to the level of the price.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but not the hover-over-you attentive that I would expect for these prices. A weird mix of 1950s and 1960s music plays a bit too loudly in the background.  Nothing says intimate Italian like \"Stand By Me\" played about 15 decibels louder than it should have been.   Lemon cello at the end seemed rushed and an afterthought. It was OK, although the alcohol overpowered the lemon.   Wast it bad?  Other than the minestrone soup, no, it was not bad.  It even had elements of great (the rigatoni). Would I go back?  No way.  There are too many other (better) options at this price point.  I'm giving 3 stars simply because it failed to deliver in just about every way. Not in food, not in ambiance, not in services.  We left very disappointed.",

They bring you lots of little goodies to start (Parmesan, soppressata salami, a variety of breads, marinated cauliflower).     Ordered a glass of nice, rich Barolo wine.  I started with a Gorgonzola Aceto salad - so delicious I kept it to enjoy throughout the meal.    For my entree went with Veal Marsala - unlike any I'd had before...it consisted of a large veal chop with grilled portobello mushrooms and a sauce that was sublime!  Finished off with coffee as I could not imagine eating more - but once again they came with a little finishing treat - 2 little cake-like cookies - I couldn't resist!  I will definitely make this a \"must go\" meal for all trips to Vegas!",

    "text": "Its surprising Carbone has so many 5-star reviews because it is just average. The portions are small and just okay, the service is on the slower side because it tends to be crowded (probably due to the misleading reviews), and its very pricey for the quality and quantity.   The only good thing I would say about this restaurant is the bottle of limoncello at the end. There are far too many superior restaurants in Vegas, find one of those.",

    "text": "Came here with a party of 5. Cool atmosphere good service and good food. I will say however, we were duped a bit when ordering, the waitress made the impression that the dishes were really small and had us order a few too many dishes. Due to this we initially ordered the veal parmesan which is the only dish we really wanted to try and ended up having to cancel it after our pastas since there was way too much food.   ANTIPASTIs - Octopus Pizzaiolo (5 stars) smokey you can really taste that BBQ charcoal flavor. Delicious  Zuppa E Insalate - House Chopped (4 stars): it's chopped salad how great can it be. Still that being said great salad.   - Caprese (5 stars): very fresh mozzarella. Probably one of the best I've had. Also they cut it up in front of you. Tomoatoes very fresh   Macaroni - Tortellini al Ragu (4 stars): nothing that really blew me away, but good dish. - lobster ravioli (4 stars): pretty good dish but I have had better.  - Spicy Rigatoni Vodka (4.5 stars): very solid spicy rigatoni vodka sauce. Creamy and quite delicious. I would probably order this pasta over any of the others.   Pesci - Pork Chop & peppers (4 stars): good dish but did not wow me. Pork was tender and moist. If I had to do it again probably would not get this dish and substitute it for the veal parmesan we were unable to try. - white fish (fish of the day) (4.5 stars): This was surprisingly a fairly good dish. very light fish.    Contorni - Funghi Trifolati- Good dish. Interesting with all the variety of different mushrooms.  - Truffle corn - You can see all the shavings of truffle on the top of the corn. Good but very overpowering with the abundant truffle shavings.   Overall good place to eat. Atmosphere was great. Oh forgot to mention they give you free limoncello and italian wedding cake. I would probably dine here again for a special occassion.",

Main dishes took longer to be served than usual and some dishes like the pastas were overly salty. Ribeye, octopus, raw tuna, meatball, fish, and caprese were excellent. Drinks were pretty and well made, but nothing special.   Service started out great then he ignored us halfway into our dinner and never even came by again. Pretty rude since they didn't seem that busy, but at least there was help to bring us our check.   They seem to try to motivate you to order more than you need, but don't. The plates, though fairly sized, are filling. So just choose what floats your boat.   Don't think I'd go back again, unless the bar area offers the bread basket, which really was the highlight of the dinner for me!",

    "text": "I had a wonderful experience at Carbone the first time I dined there, so I decided to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at this fine Italian restaurant on our recent trip to Vegas. What I thought would be one of the highlights of our trip ended up being a stain on our vacation. The food was very good - although not as good as my first visit - and the service and ambiance were excellent. It's what happened after our meal that has moved me to write this review.   I paid my bill with my Capital One credit card, and received a notification of the charge on my phone a few minutes after the waiter took my card.  After dinner, we took a tram back to our hotel and about 10 minutes later I received another notification that Carbone had charged me a second time for a slightly higher amount.  I immediately called the restaurant, and after being put on hold to connect to the restaurant, and then again to find a manager, I explained what had happened and the manager (Kevin) I spoke with put me on hold again to look into the matter. Several minutes later, he came back on the line to explain our waiter had 'accidentally' used my card for another bill, but he realized he had made an error and he corrected it. Kevin assured me the second charge - that was wrongly billed to my credit card - would be reversed.  I thanked him and figured mistakes happen, and although my follow up call took close to half an hour of my vacation to sort things out, that would be the end of it. I figured wrong.   A few days later, after I returned home, I received an email from Capital One (kudos to them for their great follow-up) asking me if I meant to leave a tip of $133.20, which was a 73% tip, on a recent visit to Carbone restaurant.  Of course, this tip was charged on top of the bill I was erroneously charged for, which I had been assured would be reversed (the incorrect charge for the wrong bill and large tip came to $316!). I called Capital One and they told me that the second charge had NOT been reversed, but told me that they would investigate and that I would not be charged unless the investigation showed there had been two charges I authorized, which they were confident did not happen (if course, it didn't).   I then called the Aria hotel (where the restaurant is located) and the operator tried to transfer me to the restaurant, but no one answered. It was around noon, and the receptionist explained the restaurant didn't open until 5, but I've worked in that industry and know that just because the restaurant wasn't open didn't mean there wasn't staff working at that time. I explained my situation to the receptionist, who was very empathetic and suggested the hotel's AP dept. might be able to help me. After waiting on hold for a good five minutes I was finally transferred to an AP rep who asked me to hold while he investigated my complaint after I explained what transpired. After several more minutes of hold time he came  back on the line and told me he found the two charges to my Visa, and that he would be looking into the issue, promising a return call within the next 24 hours.  That was several days ago and I have yet to receive that promised call. Fortunately, I have faith in Capital One to sort things out - confidence I surely do not have for Carbone restaurant or the Aria AP dept. I don't think I'll be dining at any of Aria's restaurants again after this experience.   What started out as a nice birthday dinner turned into a series of frustrating experiences, including over an hour wasted on sorting things out through phone calls to Carbone's, Capital One and the Aria hotel.  Mistakes can happen, but this (not comedic) series of errors from a highly regarded restaurant and hotel is unacceptable. If you do choose to dine at Carbone's, make sure you check your credit card bill after you've paid.",

    "text": "Wow, this was an amazing experience!  The ambiance inside is classy, warm, and comfortable.  We were seated right away at our reservation time.  It did take a little time before anyone came and offered to take drink orders, and it was somewhat confusing since they seemed to have different staff with different roles attending to each table.  Complimentary Reggiano cheese is provided at the table along with a generous and delicious bread basket with three types of bread.  They also provided what appeared to be pepperoni (the staff didn't explain what it was) delicately arranged into cones.    I tried the Mai Tai - they definitely do not skimp on the alcohol with this.  Very good!  We then tried the shrimp cocktail and Caesar salad.  The shrimp were large, fresh, and delicious.  The salad was prepared the \"old-fashioned way\" tableside in a wooden bowl.  What a nice touch!  We haven't had that even at high-end steak houses on the strip.  I went for the ribeye diana.  It was quite good with fairly tender meat in a flavorful sauce.  Side dishes are a la carte as is typical in a place like this.  The potatoes louie were excellent (crispy roasted potatoes) as was the brocollini with spicy pepper flakes.  Save room for dessert!  I tried the bananas foster served flaming tableside.  Excellent!  A perfect ending to the meal.  Not too sweet and just delicious.    Lastly, they brought out some small complimentary and delicious Italian cookies as well as limoncello.  They left the limoncello bottle... I'm not sure if that's always the case here, but it seemed we were free to have as many servings as we wanted.  It was good - light and lemony though lacked a bit of the creamy consistency I was used to from a limoncello.  Service was generally good though as mentioned above there are so many different staff coming to the table with different functions.  I think we only saw our \"table captain\" two times during the meal.    Overall, though, this was a wonderful dining experience well worth the price and definitely warrants a return visit.",

    "text": "Carbone in Aria has got to be one of the sexiest, warmest, and most intimate restaurants on the strip. The price tag is not for the faint-hearted, but you'll walk away dazzled if you find value in a beautiful overall experience.  The bar is casual yet glamorous. Beautiful plants and accents of brass, turquoise, and green. The rest of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, adorned with high-backed red booths in curtained spaces and floor-to-ceiling chandeliers that luminate with just the right amount of warmth and romance.  For starters, a bread basket with a few options like sundried tomato  foccacia, salami, and cheese. These were a really nice touch to round out an experience since people like to feel special and not nickel-and-dimed.  First, let's just get it out there that a meal for two here is not cheap. You could move this food quality over to a dodgy space downtown and end up paying less than half of Carbone's price, easily. So I'd say you'd have to be in it for the entire experience, especially if you are trying to celebrate a special occasion or do some romancing.  The tartare was super thin and seasoned so beautifully. Very rich in flavor. Take your time to enjoy it as it goes quickly!   We got a pasta and also the veal shank. I'd probably recommend something else besides the shank because it was so rich, and you couldn't eat much of it. We shared it and still took half of it home.  Dessert.... carrot cake was excellent! We wanted the tiramisu until we found out it was Nutella tiramisu. Probably the one thing that could crush your emotional high at Carbone... wanting to end with a classic, PERFECT tiramisu, and being told you can have Nutella tiramisu. (Please, higher powers at Carbone, if you are reading this... REGULAR tiramisu, and I'll come back!)  Bonus freebie... nice limoncello shots with some Italian almond cookies.   I'd describe Carbone as a special occasion type of place, but if you're looking for value for dollar in terms of food, maybe check somewhere else out. If you're looking for that overall vibe, save your quarters dutifully for a rainy day at Carbone.",

The whole staff was attentive. Kevin, the manager was also great!  The meal started with bread, sliced meat and cheese brought to the table. My friend tried some wine and ended up loving the glass she ordered. We ordered lobster ravioli, eggplant parmigiana, spicy rigatoni and a mozzarella/tomato appetizer. The mozzarella is house made and delicious!! They only have this option for a couple months when tomatoes are in season and perfect. I can't even explain how amazing their mozzarella is!  They only make a certain amount of eggplant parmigiana each day and we were lucky enough to get the last one. Bonnie mentioned that you can order chicken parmigiana two days in advance. Next time I will be sure to mention that when I make a reservation. I love chicken parmigiana and really wanted to try it!  We didn't get a chance to try dessert because we had a show to catch but the dessert tray looked delicious as we rushed by.   They have different rooms in the restaurant. We were in the main dining area that had a lot of red and gold, which gave it a vintage Vegas feel. My favorite!",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to see there was a Carbone in Vegas since I'd sort of had my heart set on trying them in New York but that opportunity ended up not happening, so... ended up saying f it! While in Vegas, right?  With that being said, I know how things go in Vegas - you open a spot that's from elsewhere and it never ever ever taste like the original. In this case, I guess it's a damn good thing I've never been to the original so I have nothing to compare this to.  I was several, I mean several cocktails deep upon my arrival for dinner so ordering wine or even a cocktail was a no go for me. I really just needed carbs for some absorption and that's what I got.  I knew I was going to order the spicy rigatoni and told myself how much different could this possibly be from the original location other than the water they are boiling the noodles in but you know, I don't know. It was quite tasty and hit the spot.  Great experience here, although on the pricier side I can see myself spending this for a meal at their original location but not completely certain I'd return to spend it for another experience here. Don't mark my words though, it was really quite yummy. The meatballs were also good, but I make some seriously insane great meatballs and I could make probably 3 dozen for the price of 3 here so where they were worth trying I probably don't need them again.  All in all great spot, to heal my heart just a little bit from not visiting their original location but still making it possible for me to try them nonetheless, just in a different city.",

We were seated right away and the waiter gave us a few recommendations. We ended up ordering all of his recs.   + Bread Basket - the garlic bread was my favorite. This was so good and the pizza focaccia was so good.   + Caprese Salad - 10/10 - they only serve this for about 9 weeks during the summer. They get tomatoes from Napa and serve it then. It was fresh, seasoned well and everything you'd want it to be.   + Spicy Vodka Rigatoni - 10/10 - the pasta is cooked perfectly al dente and has the perfect amount of spice. So good.   + Veal Parmesan - 10/10 - another dish done perfectly. I've never had veal parm before and I don't think I can have it anymore after having it here.   My only complaint is that they don't have one in LA. Our server was amazing and so nice. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas... which should hopefully be soon because it's only been a day and I already want to go back.",

One day we were at a random wine bar and this gentleman next to us told us we HAD to try Carbone as it's his favorite. He also told us to sit with Bernie, the best bartender around. Well, we did exactly that! Waited 45 mins to sit at the bar with Bernie and it was the best decision we made all summer!  We ordered: x Beef carpaccio - Wow, this was the best beef carpaccio I've ever had in my life. It was so soft, flavorful and rich. The portion is HUGE enough to share w/ 3-4 people as an appetizer. x Spicy Rigatoni - Bernie suggested we order a side of meatballs w/ this and it was the perfect recommendation. Pasta was perfectly cooked. Meatball was one of the best I ever had! x Caesar Salad - TABLE SIDE YA'LL!! With real anchovies. The best ever!!!   Every table gets pieces of parmesan cheese, a bread basket, and pickled cauliflower as well. All of which, were amazing. I can't wait to come back!! SOOO GOOOD. If you aren't feeling like pasta, just order everything else :)",

    "text": "WOOOOOW!!! I am seriously blown away by this place! I loved everything. From the ambiance/vibe, to the old school music, which turns into gangster rap at 11pm, but most importantly the quality of the ingredients. Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had on the strip.   I loved that they give complimentary Parmesan cheese as soon as we are sat. The bread basket comes out piping hot. Huge points for that! If you're a fatty like me you'll take a piece of bread, butter it, stick some cheese and salami on it and it's magic in your mouth. The pickled cauliflower was surprisingly very yummy and the perfect relief before starting on our appetizers.   We ordered the Caesar salad (because they make it table side and it's just a must), the chopped salad, and caprese to start. Caesar salad was  AH-MAZING! But I have to say the chopped salad was 10x better and super refreshing. The caprese was probably the best caprese I've ever had. The tomatoes were so sweet, they tasted like they were picked right at their peak and cut then served to us.   For our main dishes we got the Spicy Rigatoni, Dover Sole, Steak, and Veal. It was all phenomenal!   As far as desserts go, we got the lemon cheesecake and that first bite I took I felt like I died and went to heaven.   Carbone you seriously hit it straight out of the ballpark. The best service, experience, and food ever!",

We ordered the spicy rigatoni and meatballs and a salad it is overpriced but delicious. This is my third time here and probably won't come back because of the stuffy staff (except for Jason)  If you're at Aria stick to Javier's or Catch much friendlier employees",

We came in with a party of 12 for my 30th birthday 10 minutes before our reservation and were sat 45 minutes later. During dinner we were checked in on only 1 time. During our ordering process we were being completely rushed. We felt like we weren't important even with dropping a $1,500 bill. I guess that's what happens when you have customers like Tiesto and Steph Curry eating at the same time as you.   All I wanted for my birthday was the SPICY RIGATONI. I was waiting for something outstanding for the 4 +$60 full orders we ordered.. What we got was subpar. The pasta was dry with minimal sauce. The flavor was ok, it seemed like it has been sitting a while. We also ordered the branzino, which we never got. The chef took it upon himself to switch out the branzino for two smaller fish, one of which had a super sour taste. It would have been nice if they asked us what we wanted instead of taking it upon themselves to serve us another fish entirely.  On a positive note, the Madagascar shrimp, prosciutto, and Caesar salad were phenomenal.  I could have overlooked some of the negatives had out experience been better.  If you want that amazing dinning and food experience I would go somewhere else. I was disappointed and this place is definitely not worth the hype.",

    "text": "Damn. It's honestly a 3.5 star experience.  I'm rounding up because the service really was that damn good. I have so many thoughts about this place, so if this review gets all over the place my apologies.   Backstory : Wife and I in Vegas for a 2 nighter no kids. Been wanting to try this spot. Had about 250 dollars worth of mlife points from my mlife credit card that I converted to express comps to use here. So yes it was going to be a free or almost free meal. I know Carbone is expensive and this is Vegas so I didn't think I was able to be surprised by prices. I was wrong.  Atmosphere: Carbone is absolutely stunning. It just looks so crisp and impressive.  We had a great booth in the main dining room.  My wife and I ordered a bunch of stuff and shared it family style. I think it's the best way to do Carbone. Here's what we got.  Shrimp Cocktail: Honestly not impressed.  The cocktail sauce was not good. And  it was 34 dollars! For a shrimp cocktail! Crazy and not good.  Caesar alla Zz: Salad was made tableside.  They split it for us. It was good not great. I love tableside Caesar. If any restaurant has it I'll automatically order it. It just didn't blow mind. Note :Salad is huge. Don't order one salad per person. $24   Spicy Rigatoni: Excellent.  The signature dish. My wife has celiac and they split this for us giving her gluten free pasta and me regular. Good job Carbone. Way to be on it.  Ribeye Diana: Really good. Perfectly cooked as requested  at medium rare.  Sides:  Roasted Potato : Meh.  Corn: Wow! So good.  Drinks:  Lemon Drop: 24 dollars. Geez come on  This is where Vegas just gets stupid to me   24 bucks for just a standard  Lemon Drop? Old Fashioned: A bargain compared to my wifes Lemon Drop at an 18 dollar price tag. This drink was really good. I was taken aback when I read on the drink menu that Carbone's signature Old Fashioned is made with Rum. I had never heard of that. I tried to order with Whiskey but our Captain Assistant talked me in to trying it the way make it. His service was top knotch all night. He told me he's an old fashioned guy and he totally digs the rum Carbone version.  Glad I trusted him. He was on the money. Drink was amazing.  Service: First class all the way. We had our main captain and then the assistant helping us. They know how to take care of you here.  Gluten: My wife can't have it. The captain was super knowledgeable about which items were gluten free, which could be modified, and which ones were a no go. Almost the whole menu is gluten free or can be modified to be gluten free.  FinalThoughts: Glad I tried it but I don't think I'll be back. Service was great and the food overall was good but for what you would pay here I feel like there's better options.",

    "text": "CARBONE. Just the name takes me back to one of the most memorable dinners I've had in recent history. Although the one in NY has been on my bucket list for ages, was thrilled to check out the one in Vegas, conveniently timed with my birthday. Couldn't have been a more perfect choice for my dinner. I knew I wanted Italian, but with all the great food on the Strip it was tough to land on a choice, though I knew deep down Carbone had always been it. And I was not disappointed.  It's borderline indescribable what makes the ambiance so spot-on and enticing. You walk in and see a photo of Christopher Walken flanking the wall behind the host stand. You're immediately engulfed in something that exudes a masculine vibe with touches of mafioso glamour, but elegant enough for us ladies to be dressed to the 9's and feel on top of the world. But not so elegant that it feels stuffy.  The servers are friendly/accessible, not snooty at all. The menu is tight but you really don't need to overthink at all. We opted for the Caesar salad (\"Caesar alla ZZ\" to be exact) we had heard so much about + 2 pastas and it was the perfect amount. The presentation element on the Caesar salad was something else (a show in and of itself). I'd also say that it was probably the best rendition I have had in my life.  But before the dishes even came out, we had a delicious bread basket brought to the table (who would have thought a bread basket could be this exciting?). After the salad, we moved on to the pasta, and here's where my mouth starts watering even now. The Spicy Rigatoni Vodka is well worth the hype. It's perfectly cooked, and clearly one of their signature dishes. Our other dish of Fettuccine Con Funghi was a fragrant, wonderful complement.  For dessert, of course I wanted the flair that came with the Bananas Foster and that it did deliver, along with an oh so delicious version of something I have always loved. This was paired with complimentary limoncello, such a nice touch.  The entire staff is cooperative with supporting each table and like I mentioned, not stuffy at all. I expected an air of attitude at some point given this place truly is $$$$, but not once did I pick up on it. I did notice the dichotomy of truly delicious wine in perfectly-polished glasses with plates that came with chips on the edges. We began wondering if this was intentional only after several plates came in that way. Guess we'll chalk it up to the 'charm' that's part of the establishment?  Overall excellent experience though. Would recommend for die hard Italian-lovers.",

As for dinner options, There are menu options that may throw you off, however it is family style. The Carpaccio is absolutely delish. I suggest ordering a app, share pasta plate with an entre. If you over order you may not have room for dessert. As an end to a fantastic dinner, you will finish off with home made lemonchello.",

It is super unprofessional of the servers to approach customers this way. Not sure if management is pushing them to have a higher check average.

    "text": "There are some meals you want to forget, some meals you do forget, and some meals you cannot forget.  This was one we will never forget.  For our 10th anniversary, we wanted to go some place special and Carbone's came highly recommended.  The ambiance of the restaurant alone was worth going.  It gave us that classic-Vegas feel.  The music was perfect for the restaurant.  They played many classic tunes and it set the mood perfectly.    Our waiter, Dion, was one of the best waiters we've ever had.  He was professional, courteous, and personable.  But mostly, he didn't come off as a snooty waiter that you sometimes get at restaurants of this caliber.  He was relatable and treated us with respect and courtesy.  Helping Dion was Richard, who also treated us like royalty and made us feel valued as customers.    The food was some of the best I've ever had.  The bread service was top notch and I cannot get over how good the fresh Parmesan was.  For our appetizers, we had the sizzling pancetta (phenomenal) and the beef carpaccio (yum!)The meal itself is almost indescribably good.  We shared a spicy rigatoni and porterhouse with a side of potatoes Louie.  We also had two of the meatballs.  Best potatoes I have ever had in my life.  They were so delicious that I literally (and I hate using that word because so many people use it incorrectly) was at a loss for words.  It was an absolutely remarkable side.  Unless you don't like potatoes, get these at all costs.  The steak was also delicious and one of the best I've had.  The rigatoni was  good and definitely spicy!  For dessert we ordered the carrot cake and it became the best carrot cake we've ever had.    I've read some reviews on here regarding the size of the portions.  It is True, they are smaller than other places, but here is the thing:  This isn't the Olive Garden or Fazoli's.  You don't get your meal served with a shovel or in a trough.  This is fine dining with exquisite cooking, and is meant to be served in a certain way.  We followed Dion's advice and ordered the multi-course meal and had more than enough food.  We even ended up taking some with us.  You also won't find Olive Garden's prices here, so be prepared.   But it was worth every single penny we spent.    Good memories have no price tag, and this was one of those good memories.  When we are old and gray, we are going to remember the night we went to Carbone's.",

    "text": "Probably still a 4 star but just having such high expectation and everything was just not that life changing like everyone else raved about.  As Carbone NY is just impossible go make reservation, decided to try the one in LV and call it a day.   Prosciutto & Mozzarella - good but so does everywhere else.  Baked Clam - it's fine, when there's too many layers it's hard to know what you are eating.  Caesar Salad - I thought they said it's homemade dressing but really couldn't tell the difference. It's a good Caesar Salad, but not a unique one you have to have at $25,  anchovy was also way too salty to eat.  Meatball - secret menu, not bad but also nothing special, tomato sauce was good though.  Rigatoni Vodka - so excited to have my first bite and then I didn't bother to maybe have the third one. Over-sauced, etc..  Dover Sole - it's a okay fish but not worth $125...  Squash with Ricotta or Mascarpone side - very fatty dish but love it the flavor was great.   Not to be the only person not loving Carbone here, everything was done \"fine\" here, but just no excitement and lack of satisfaction after having the meal. I know LV is expensive but Carbone also it's super on the top of the LV expensive side.   Also our reservation was 8pm, and we got there around 7:40pm. Host goes: if your reservation is at 8pm means you will get seated at 8pm, not earlier. He suggest we go grab a drink at the bar, we were at the bar until 8:15pm and no one ever come take us to our table until we go back to the entry and remind them, not very hospitality.",

We had a group of 20 people and split in to two 10-person tables, which was fine - we were happy to work with the restaurant to accomodate their space. We also committed to a minimum spend of nearly $3,000 - again, fine...we were happy to work with Carbone as long as they accomodated us. However, the service was the worst I've ever experienced. We might as well have been at McDonalds. What a slap in the face for us to spend so much money and get treated as if we didn't even exist. We had to ask numerous times for food, to get our waters refilled, asking the bus boys to bring the waiter over, etc. It was truly one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had, which is amazingly sad because it was awful one of the most expensive dinners I've ever had. I would literally never go back and I hope no one else does.",

BY FAR THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD...EVER!  First off, the bread basket is soo fresh and every single item is good.  I rarely touch the bread basket, and if I do, its usually for 1 piece.  Here, I had 4-5 pieces and had to restrain myself from taking more.  Service was fantastic as well!  Water was ALWAYS filled.  Items ordered:  Beef Carpaccio (BEST I have ever ever ever had) Caesars salad (Pretty good) Spicy Vodka Rigatoni (Overrated, but good) Minestrone (dont order, not worth $20) Oysters (Delish) Octopus (Delish)  One thing to note, this place is expense AF.  There should be 5 dollar signs for places like this.  That being said, I highly recommend going.",

    "text": "I have to say that the service was excellent.  The coffee was really tasty and the fresh Caesar Salad was to die for.  My husband ordered the Veal Marsala and it came out as a bone in veal chop.  If he had wanted a chop, he would have ordered one.  I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and they didn't mention that it would be in squids ink pasta.  The flavor was so strong it was practically inedible.  We tried to split dessert but even that was horrible.  I can't remember what they called it but it was supposed to be some twist on bananas foster.  I didn't realize that the base would be a rock hard chocolate brownie.  We scrapped everything off of the brownie and tried to eat what we could that was edible.  We knew that we were eating a pricey restaurant but paying over $200, for the two of us to both have horrible meals was awful.  The manager kept lingering saying isn't that wonderful, and when we would complain she kept saying, well you must not go to New York because this is the way it is done in New York.  I have never had Veal marsala, in New York or anywhere else that used a bone in veal chop.  Sorry, it was definitely NOT what he was looking for in a meal that night.  The Marsala sauce was typical of any you would find a  decent restaurant.  Also, be aware that if you are going to eat anywhere on the strip, valet parking is now anywhere from $10-$20 for less than 4 hours.  We paid $14 to valet our car so we could have the horrible $200 meal.  It was a nightmare dinner and we will never return there again.  Their menu does not do a very good job of describing the various dishes.  So, I was being generous with two stars and that was only because the Caesar Salad and coffee were so good. PG",

He was pushy with what we ordered. For example, he told us we did not order enough clams, but there were more than enough.  The last straw was when he rolled his eyes at us (twice) because he did not like our questions about how the different dishes were prepared. There are no descriptions on the menu so you have to ask if you want to know what you are getting. The music was so loud (ridiculously loud) and he had an accent so we had to ask him to repeat himself and he got frustrated with us. It was extremely offensive and a kick in the teeth when you spend over a $1K on a dinner. We frequent Vegas (at least 4 times a year) and we go back to the places we enjoy. We will certainly not be going back to Carbone.",

    "text": "Carbone was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas. When entering the room it took me back to our dining experiences in NYC and maybe due to the chandelier, the Rainbow Room initially came to mind (not the view however). They did create the environment they advertise. But the best part was the food, which was some of the best traditional Italian the 5 of us have had. The sauces were expertly prepared and complimented the pasta dishes exactly. The main entrees were perfection and all were made to certain requests a couple of us made.  The service was excellent and very attentive but not intrusive. And finally our desserts were also high quality with some extras also provided by the very friendly and enjoyable staff. Our only negative was the hefty priced wine list which needs attention. Overall this restaurant deserves 5 stars.   Our dining experience was a couple of days before Christmas so the restaurant was quiet except for the 50/60s music. But that did add to the experience which even our middle aged children agreed went with the decor. Yes, it did add to the dining experience listening to songs sung by the \"rat pack\" that made you want to get up and dance like we did back then. So some reviewers may be turned off by the environ but the designers and management were right on with the restaurant theme.",

A plate arrived with a chunk of veal sliced off the bone into 1\" hunks.  There was very little edible meat, grizzle and fat were served.  The grilled asparagus was okay.  The pasta dish with rigatoni and vodka sauce was tasty.  The bread was tasty too.  I have dined many times in Italy.  This restaurant is way overpriced for the quality.",

It is very expensive which is ok if the service and food quality it good. Our server was horrible. He avoided us most of the night. He would walk by and avoid making eye contact with us. When the servers brought out our food they just dropped it on the table in front of us and walked away. Once again I expect a premium fine dining restaurant to have great service and provide good food presentation and not just drop plates on the table and walk off. The support staff had no problem refilling our glasses of wine but it was never our main server. My wife and I were not very happy with our food as it did not have much flavor. The baked clams had no flavor, pasta was ok and the Branzino fish plate was good but by then we could not enjoy it because we were upset with our experience. We were very disappointed to spend our anniversary dinner here.",

At this point we asked about our meatballs we never got. Our waiter told us \" he would try and get them to us. \" After being  annoyed and tired we told him to never mind and his response was \" OH GOOD I THINK WE ARE OUT ANYWAY \" WAIT WHAT ?!?!?? ok, so you were just not going to serve us what we ordered and just think we were going to forget about it.  Our waiter then was no where to be found was asked one of the assistants for our check in which he brought it. He never asked us if we were interested in dessert, I never got asked if I wanted another glass of wine ? We had plans of eating and drinking all night but over 2 hours at a dinner and we didn't even get appetizers. Also, someone told me everyone gets free cookies .. Never got them never saw them. I've eaten at so many places in Vegas and never had crappier customer service. They told us they were \" busy \" well, it's Vegas on a Friday night ... I would assume you would be used to busy.  For being a fine dining establishment they were unprofessional. We told the manager on the way out and she basically said they were busy and \" what could she do for us? \" For a 300$ dinner I rather spend the 300$ at Jean George's across the hallway or Olives at the Bellagio. I have several friends in the restaurant industry in Vegas, I told them about our experience and they were flabbergasted. Was the food good ? Yes. But I don't want to wait 30 Minutes for salads. Also, there were four of us. It's not like we were a table of 12. I would expect a 2-2.5 hour dinner when you are drinking, eating appetizers, salads, entrees and dessert. If the customer service would have been better I can assure you 3 more alcoholic beverages minimum would have been ordered, and we would have each gotten a dessert. But dessert at 11:30 pm didn't sound appetizing since I was falling asleep at the table Practically. So so so disappointed after we had heard so many good things. We checked out of our hotel this morning and I was sure to tell all four of the people Standing there about our experience. They felt bad and all said they wish there was something they could do.",

    "text": "It was my birthday last week and I usually go to Il Mulino.  I decided to mix it up and try Carbone.  All though it was good, I don't think Il Mulino has anything to worry about.  Basically a red sauce joint that was way too expensive for the quality of their food. Was a beautiful room wih very good service.  The main reason i did not go back to Il Mulino is that they \"house u\" on the wine list and there is no corkage fee allowed.  At Carbone they allow you to bring a bottle at $50, Magnum $75 The wine that i brought, 2005 Leoville Las Cases was actually on their wine wine list for $825.00!  Generally when a restaurant has the same wine and vintage, they will not allow you to open up your own  bottle.  The som. was real cool because of it being my birthday.  Ok     However, the food was just good and outrageously expensive.  For 65 bucks u get a Veal Chop Parm that was kind of small and a little soggy.  Whatever the fish was (supposed to be like Branzino) for 60 bucks it was good but tiny.  At Il Mulino, there Branxino is roasted in salt and filated  (spelling not right and a little risque) and is big enough for 2 people.  Plus 100 times more flavorful.  Incidently, best Veal Park is at Buddy V^s in the Venetian.  42 bucks WITH spaghetti.  Every otber place charges like?15 just for a side of pasta. Next year I am going to suck it up and pay the 20 bucks for the house wine at I'm Mulino, the one and only Italian high end place that is actually worth the price.",

I came here twice and the first time i came for my business dinner was a solid 5 star. this time i returned with my family and baby (And i appreciate the staff for being accommodating). food was still excellent, but the big let down was actually our waiter. he just gave us a menu and asked what we wanted. no explanation of special of the day nor any explanation of any other menu. i had to hunt down our waiter throughout the dinner to ask for stuff even though it wasn't busy. i think it was a problem with our waiter since i saw other tables were taken care of better. also we ordered dessert. no cleaning of table except taking our plates away. i was waiting for the limoncello and the cookie i had last time but didn't come this time. perhaps this is not given all the time so i didn't bother asking. it would've been a solid 5 star experience again but the service was a major let down. this is not a hole in the wall store. if i pay more than 100 dollars per person, i expect a great service from it. i would have to venture out for other italian restaurants as i probably would not return anymore",

I couldn't eat much of it and had to take it home - it was admittedly better the 2nd day once the flavors calmed down.

The maitre d is so helpful, accommodating and friendly! Along with the entire staff from bus boy to waiter to bartender! Top of the line service. The complimentary goodies in the beginning are delish! Salami and breads..mmm the menu itself is a bit overpriced. I wanted the famous veal but wasn't paying $70 when eating alone only if sharing. Opted for the famous penne with vodka sauce and one meatball. The penne was too rich for me. Looked beautiful! But very intense and overrated sadly. The meatball was okay. Next time I would try the veal parm and tortellini ragu instead. I think best to only come here if sharing and having a couple bites of each dish to avoid a tummy ache from how decadent it truly is.",

Their breads amazing tasted like pizzza! Nom nom nom. Very nice dim lights big round table and romantic. Good wine. Ordered shrimp cocktail w horseradish that packed a punch but was so yummy. Grilled octopus with peppers so delicious. Then italian wedding soup they pour it in front of you and the meatballs were phenomenal they were moist and full of flavor everything was to share so it makes for a perfect date ! For the main we ordered the spicy rigatoni and veal parmigiana. Unfortunately i dont remember our servers name but he was awesome. When we peeked at the menu i told the boyfriend what i had my eye on and he suggested all the exact things so i ended up winning on the menu selections! I wish i could take a big bowl of the rigatoni home with me on the airplane so i could eat the pasta forever ! Soo to finish up we had the tiramisu that had this delectable chocolate bottom that was perfect. I loved this place no disappointments here! Id definitely recommend this as a nice date spot",

Had prosciutto d mozz which was awesome, baked clams were good, meatball app was excellent. For pasta course the spicy rigatoni was great, lobster ravioli were good. The entrees however were way overpriced and thus 4 stars not 5. A $200 porterhouse umm no. Just no. Been to plenty of steakhouse in town, don't care how big it is there shouldn't be a $200 porterhouse on the menu. $64 veal parm didn't meet expectations for the price either. Desserts were good. Carrot cake was really good. Tiramisu was just ok, should keep it more traditional. Didn't like their spin on it. All in all a good solid dining spot in aria!",

I thought they gave us the Italian cookies and lemoncello to make up for the bad service but it seems that they do this nice gesture for many which is actually very sweet.

You get complimentary parmesan cheese bites at the bar while waiting, which is a nice touch in this town.

This Italian classic fell short for me because of it poor service and lackluster food. I ordered the steak Diane and the spicy rigatoni alla vodka. Both dishes were brought out cold and platted poorly. The past over cooked and cold. The steak was chewy and cold. The one saving grace was the potatoes al gratin cooked in duck fat. It turned out  to be my main dish. In addition the porterhouse ordered at market price was billed at $200. Never was the ounces requested by the diners or explained by the servers. It was an epic failure of a dinner and would not recommend it for a True Italian fare with all the other restaurants to choose from in Vegas. Try Sinatra for upscale Italian or any other chain Italian restaurant on the strip and forgo this one.",

My favorite dish was the octopus appetizer dish. I have never tried octopus that fresh with that much flavor. We also tried the spicy rigatoni, lobster ravioli, and steak. Steak was delish.

    "text": "Another fantastic restaurant in Las Vegas. New at the Aria hotel, there is much buzz about this place as this NYC restaurant has seen much success since its conception. This place reminds you of old school NY - elegant, cozy, and inviting. Excellent wait staff that really knows the food and will let you know if you are ordering the right amount of food for the table. The wine list is extensive and the cocktail menu is old fashion in a good way (think Manhattan and Old Fashioned). You really can judge any restaurant by the quality of its bread basket and this place offered some delicious variety of bread such as the YUMMY focaccia bread, garlic bread, and just simple sour dough bread. Also they shaved some complimentary parmigiano reggiano and bought pickled cauliflower to the table.   FRESH OYSTERS / SPICY RIGATONI: We ordered fresh oysters to start - the oysters were fresh from Long Island, which at first I was like \"Oh, really...hoping for a mix of some from the west coast given that we were in Vegas\" but it absolutely did not disappoint...it was sweet and had a nice kick to it from the pepper condiment atop....and plus I'm a bigger fan of the East Coast oysters anyways. We also shared the Spicy Rigatoni pasta which they conveniently split the order for the table and this was some of the best pasta I've ever had...perfectly al dente, simple, creamy, and delicious. I was in heaven.  GRILLED SCALLOPS / CHERRY PEPPER RIBS: For the entree I ordered the Scallops. At this point, I was super full (must be all that bread). The scallops were cooked perfectly and had nice grill marks so you really taste the light char but still have the inherit sweetness and saltiness from the scallops. The dish was accompanied with shaved zucchini which I don't think did much for the dish (perhaps shaved picked cucumber would've been a better choice). Think what really threw me off was the cilantro, mint, and basil all together in a dish. Definitely had better scallop dishes in other restaurants, but nonetheless, still great and no real complaints...although don't think I would order it again next time. Perhaps will go for the dover sole. My boyfriend ordered the Cherry Pepper Ribs as recommended by our waiter which looked absolutely mouth-watering delish. He was only able to eat two of the three ribs since they were massive.  NUTELLA TIRAMISU: OMG. This was like so good on every level. So after you're done with your meal. They bring over the dessert cart of all their special desserts and I really can't fit any more food in my body but once they said TIRAMISU and NUTELLA all in one sentence, we had to order one and IT WAS AMAZING. LIKE SO AMAZING that I'd have to order this every single time.  Upon receiving your bill, you get some complimentary rainbow cookies and limoncello. Wasn't a fan of either. The rainbow cookies were very disappointing (maybe because I just had the nutella tiramisu...or maybe because I'm from Brooklyn) and the limoncello was too sweet. All in all, very happy to have tried this place and definitely will be visiting the NY location soon.",

    "text": "The restaurant had a nice ambiance but overall, it was a huge disappointment.  I was there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and invited one other friend to come along with us.  Although I notified the restaurant that we were there for a special occasion when I made the reservation as well as informing the girl that seated us at our table to remind the waiter, no mention was made of his birthday.   Unless you are psychic, you won't know what the dishes on the menu consist of because there are no descriptions (except for a few standards like Veal Marsala).  Our waiter acted like he was doing us a favor by describing the dishes.  The Caesar salad ($21 each!) was prepared table side and the dressing was good, but the lettuce pieces and croutons were very large.  No cracked black pepper was offered at the table.  My friend's pasta dish was very average and barely had enough Vodka sauce to coat the too-chewy al dente rigatoni.  My boyfriend's Rib Eye Diane was not \"Diane\" style at all.  It was very fatty and greasy even for a rib eye steak and had a few sliced mushrooms on top for $54.  I didn't even order an entree because I couldn't find one menu item that seemed appealing enough to me and the waiter didn't seem interested in explaining any of the dishes or was he aware of the price of the \"specials.\"  He \"thought\" the two fish Market Price items were around $90 and I wasn't about to be surprised when I received the bill, so I passed on those two offerings.  The parmesan cheese, pickled cauliflower, bread basket and Limoncello were nice touches.  There are too many other good fine dining establishments in Vegas for this restaurant to be so impressed with itself.  After reading some of the other reviews posted, I realized that I was not alone in my opinions.",

Chopped salad also good, I heard.  Pasta's:  Angel Hair AOP (too spicy!!), Spaghetti Vongole (clams were rubbery, a bit greasy).  Entrees ordered:  Dover sole (delicious and waiter filleted the fish table side), Veal Parm (pretty good).  Desserts:  grapefruit w/sorbet (refreshing), lemon cheesecake (nice), chocolate cherry something cake (lacking a bit of intensity).   When we got the check the nasty surprise was $100 for the sole!  Thought it was tacky tacky tacky that they didn't tell us that when they described the dish and we ordered it.  Most expensive meal yet in Vegas!  And, not the best one we had either.  Nice touch was the limoncello and rainbow cookies for the finale.",

    "text": "I have to say that this was the only downside to what was otherwise a stellar weekend in Vegas with my older brother and stay at the beautiful Aria (which I highly recommended in another yelp review). The average score was because Carbone did some wonderful things out of the gates with being met by a waiter, a sommelier and floor Captain all of which were very accommodating at the beginning. They made recommendations which typically I will lean towards as I believe they are in the know and also began by bringing us some fresh made salami and parmesan cheese which were complimentary and delicious. As it was my brothers treat (I had night two at Prime at Bellagio) he chose an excellent bottle of Italian red which must have been incredible as we split two (don't judge!). Well we started with Captain's recommendation which was to have their caesar salad which is made table side and per his words, the best in Vegas. From my experience I concur, it was delicious. Next course, also a recommendation from the Captain was a rigatoni with meatballs which, again my brother and I shared equally. And again delicious. This is where unfortunately for myself and later both of us, our experience turned. It seemed as though they may have lost our entree order in a busy shuffle of many big tables or rush of new orders or what have you and truthfully, we may not have noticed except for the fact that the Captain came by not once but three times over a 30 minute span to tell us our entrees were coming right up.  They eventually arrived with my brother having Veal Parmesan and myself opting for the Captain's recommendation of their unbelievable Short Ribs entree special. I must say that I am a short rib aholic (don't judge) and will try them pretty much anywhere and anytime they are recommended. Call it a sort of pavlovian response to hearing the words spoken; short rib and I'm ordering it. Well I took my first bite and immediately knew something was not right. But I thought maybe the mealy chewy nature of the first bite may have been a bad cut? Then the second bite and the consistency of the mealy nature did not go away. And the flavor? Well I had my brother taste them after I did and without telling him what I thought it tasted like, he said pastrami? Insane right? My brother was paying over $50 bucks (don't know exact cost as my brother paid) for pastrami. And not good pastrami mind you this was in bulk. Had they shaved it over a toasted rye with mustard I may have eaten it but after two bites I was quickly feeling my appetite go away and was not able to enjoy. Well about 10 minutes in the Captain comes by to check how we are doing and my brother has almost finished his veal parmesan and I had a full plate of \"short ribs\". And yes I know folks I should have spoken up and said, dog food but after waiting for the meal with such anticipation, I didn't want to wait further. Captain did not ask if there was anything wrong with my meal which I was always taught is service etiquette 101, rather went about his business.   A few minutes later they come and clear our plates, not asking if I wanted my full plate of \"short ribs\" packaged for my room (I believe they all must had tasted them at the pre-service meeting!). They follow up quickly with dessert menus. I order a tiramisu to share with my brother and we both order a cappuccino. The dessert and cappuccinos arrive with the check put on the table immediately with us being told they will take that for us whenever we were ready. We thought that odd that they dropped a check as A: we did not ask for it and B: We were not in a TGI Fridays or Applebee's, we were in a $$$$ Italian restaurant.  In any event while my brother and I acknowledged that it was odd, he placed the check by himself, signaling that he was indeed paying. Within 15 seconds of doing that, the Captain came by again asking if he could take the check. We were one bite in on a dessert with full cappuccino's! My brother looked at me and said the the Captain; \"you want us to pay now don't you?\". Must have another table waiting was my comment (they easily had 6 random tables open within view). Captain was caught off guard from this, apologized and ran off. My brother took out his credit card, we paid and left after finishing our cappuccinos.   So to wrap it up, I am giving a three because I am hopeful the issues with long time tickets and frequent reminders of same as well as being given a check rather than the institution waiting for a guest to request same, were one off deals, never to be done again. I hope. The issue of the short ribs should not have happened. They were awful in both flavor and consistency and I believe all of the staff should have an opportunity to try every meal being offered that evening at pre service and their opinions be readily received without fear of repercussions from a chef. My brother gave a lower score but he also paid the $750 plus bill and had every right to. You can and should do better.",

    "text": "Went there only three weeks opened. Just a few touches need to be smoothed out (had reservation - still waited appr 30 min. couple of things on menu not available) I chalked this up to the newness and still ironing some kinks out. No penalty here, more on that in a minute.  We had: - Lobster Ravioli - perfect - elegantly served but not over the top - with delicate perfectly sized pieces of lobster in a cream sauce, with light pieces of fresh ravioli - superb dish - The proscuitto appetizer with pieces of mozzarella cut while you watch - excellent - bountiful bread dish and a waiter trolling the restaurant with an enormous block of reggiano of the best quality. and finally...  the reason for the five star rating is the Dover Sole - $100 portion (whole fish) absolutely for two or more, was the finest I have ever eaten and the presentation tableside by Michael was flawless. A show in itself that left your mouth watering for the taste and absolutely didn't dissapoint.  The cocktails were excellent, wine pairing well done, desert was very good although not up to the dinner in my opinion but still good..  Dinner was a feast, the service was excellent, (the staff being well informed, experienced, and enthuiastic) and the ambiance of the main dining room (the red room) was perfect. Clearly there was much experience and thought put into this place.  I gave this 5 stars because 4 was just not enough to describe our evening so I gave it the five in the anticipation that the couple of corrections needed will be improved soon  I would jump on a plane just to eat there again and the original is in my city ! NYC !",

I'm taking a star off because while the pasta and fish entrees are priced \"reasonably\" for Vegas, the meat dishes are--to me, even though I haven't tried them--unreasonable.  I'd also like to see a description of the dish on the menu, not just the name. All in all, it's a great place for a cocktail and dinner with a really cool old-school Italian atmosphere.",

    "text": "I spent 9 days in Italy recently and this restaurant screams AMERICAN food posing as ITALIAN.  It's like when you want authentic Chinese food you don't go to PF Chang's you go to the hole in the wall in Chinatown that turns out generational recipes where the food makes you go uh huh yea this hits the spot.  So if you don't want the full review - I have a quick overview right below:  POSITIVES: -Start you off with a Parmesan chunk from the wheel -Variety of table bread, pickled cauliflower and salami -Meatballs -Tableside service for multiple dishes including Caesar Salad -Lemon Cheesecake -Complimentary Limoncello (digestif post dinner) (vodka, lemon, sugar) they leave the bottle at your table along with Italian rainbow cookies  NEGATIVES: -Service was awful -Taste like BOX pasta  -Menu is super small so very little variety -Wine prices are absurd -Sommelier only directs you to expensive wines and doesn't bother asking questions to pair food properly, what's the point?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  APPETIZER: *Foie Gras Veneziana $45 Two pieces of foie gras that were seared to melt in your mouth.  The foie gras was silky, buttery, umami and I was pleasantly surprised that the accompanying sauteed onions didn't overwhelm the foie gras but definitely complemented it.  ENTREES: *Spicy Rigatoni Vodka Pasta: So I asked the hostess that walked us to the table, the busser and the server which of the pastas do they like most and all three said this one.  Okay, ordered it and almost spit it out.  WTF.  The pasta was way too al dente, definitely did not taste homemade, was really dry and plain and the sauce - where was the spice?  So I know you're probably thinking my idea of spice is really spicy and it's not.  I can't handle much spice and what I tasted was some super bland onion powder tasting pasta.  Gross.  Took 2 morsels and left it on the side of the table.   *Gemelli di Rabe: fusilli pasta with a pesto sauce with tomatoes and broccoli rabe.  The pasta was not too al dente this time but it's helpful the pasta was a lot smaller and the rabe was bitter but not too bitter.  It could use some additional seasoning - salt, pepper, cheese, pepper flakes, something.    *Pro tip: Order the meatballs.  You get 3 large ones to an order for $18 and they are super tasty.  I would also ask them to make sure they come out PIPING HOT because ours were definitely room temperature.  My friend and I were saying that if they were hot, they might be the best meatballs we've ever had.    WINE/SOMMELIER: We wanted to get a bottle of red wine, preferably a Cabernet and he asked me what the most recent wine I've liked is and I said Worthy Cab 2012 (about $30 retail).  So he pointed me to a dozen Napa Valley bottles that were $250-$1,000 a bottle!  I mean I'm not trying to spend that much and there were no descriptions or additional questions on tasting notes, what we are ordering to pair it properly or anything else.  So after some discussion of what we were planning on having for dinner I opted for a Brunello in our price range which was under $150.  I asked the sommelier for his opinion on 4 Brunello bottles ranging from $100-$150 and he picked the $150 - I'm seeing a pattern here.  DESSERT: $15 each *Lemon Cheesecake: It's pretty lemony but not in a bad way, it sort of cuts through the richness.  It also has a nice thick graham cracker crust which I appreciate. *Tiramisu: It isn't your traditional tiramisu and it's a fairly dense cake and it has layers of nutella instead of the espresso soaked lady fingers.  I was recently in Venice, this is not tiramisu.  SERVICE: Our server Santiago was meh.  I struggled to tip 20% but I did only because the team he worked with made up for his terrible service.  He was barely attentive and after my replacement pasta order he didn't even come check on it until I waved him down from our booth and I was already halfway done.  I need grated cheese and pepper because again, food is so bland here.    VERDICT: I would skip this place simply because the food was not that good.  We spent $500 on two people and I really hated our whole dining experience, mostly because of the lack of service we received from Santiago.  My friend isn't as picky as I am and he even thought it was a pretty low level of service.",

When we sat at our table our waiter was extremely helpful in navigating the menu. I think his name was James. I normally don't order Caesar salad but I just wanted to watch him do it at the table and it was great. Then we were able to have the chef prepare an appetizer of gluten-free rigatoni. There's no way you could tell it was gluten-free. After that we shared a Dover sole for two. The fish was outstanding. The portion was quite large. I actually thought we were going to split one and I was a little shocked when the Bill came and I saw the price. \" Wow did I break a window \" lol  But hey it's Vegas. Finished up with a shared cheesecake which was also very decadent. I won't report the price but it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.",

I think they were trying to make the place look full.   A drunk and a waiter both bumped into the table. Not something that should happen during a 300 dollar meal for two without wine.  We would have ordered wine, but they seemed very expensive for relatively mediocre bottles of wine, even for Las Vegas.    We sat there for 10 minutes before they brought us menus.  We sat for long times with no food between courses.  The waiters were just out of central casting.  Appropriately italian, but without the love of the people.   We had the porter house steak for two.  It was market price, but they didn't know the price.  Took a few minutes of discussion with some other people to decide.  I am sure we were ripped off.    The steak and fish were very good. Not perfect, but good, but the service was terrible.  Not worth going.  It embarrassing that I picked the restaurant.",

We were in a rush to get to the Gwen concert and asked if we could get food to go. Unfortunately they don't do that. We were seated immediately and my sister (who works in fine dining) took over. She let our server know that we were in a hurry and handed him her credit card. She ordered the table side Cesar salad, the vodka rigatoni, spaghetti puttanesca and 4 meatballs (which are not on the menu). She also asked that they bring over the dessert table . I picked out carrot cake and that they were able to put into a take out box. The food was as amazing as the first time we tried Carbone. The portions are fairly small and other than the carrot cake the other desserts aren't traditional flavored. They start your meal with a bread basket, pickled vegetables and a block of Parmesan cheese. At the end of the meal they bring cake slices and a bottle of limoncello. I see many people commenting on pricing. I would definitely fly in for that vodka rigatoni and fly home on the same day.  It's that worth it to me. I see many complaints on prices and service time. One should remember that prices are relative and it's a take your time kind of meal.",

    "text": "We've been really good at choosing restaurants lately, because once again we had an absolutely amazing experience at Carbone!  I am not one to just go to the Strip and am just as happy at local hidden gems, but I am certainly glad we decided to eat at Carbone. This was our first date night after baby was born and my Mom was nice enough to babysit so we could enjoy a few hours out of the house. We were also celebrating my birthday and I was excited to be able to enjoy a glass or 2 of wine with dinner.  We both love Italian food and were excited to try out this restaurant. We made our reservations via OpenTable and notated that we were celebrating 3 special occasions - the birth of our little one, our recent nuptials, and my birthday. I guess we like to cram all of our celebrations into 1 dinner!  Carbone is located on the 2nd level promenade of the Aria Hotel and Casino, adjacent to the buffet. If you are staying on the Strip, I suggest walking or taking a cab, because Aria does now charge for parking and the restaurants do not offer validation, even if you are a local resident. This restaurant is an import from New York City, where they've had a popular location in Greenwich Village.   This is New York inspired Italian food and not what you would find in Italy. But don't let that scare you off, this food is AMAZING! When booking our reservation, I specifically requested a quiet table in the \"red room,\" which is located in the back of the restaurant. This is a more romantic area and it didn't disappoint. We were seated in a small booth and felt tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the casino.   We decided to start with a bottle of wine and chose a reasonably priced red. I think the Sommelier was silently judging us, but isn't that what Sommelier's do?! The servers are called \"Captains\" and ours was fantastic. He suggested quite a few of his favorite dishes and explained what their signature items were.  The server's assistant brought out a small bowl with various pickled vegetables and also a selection of breads, along with oil and vinegar. This was a great start to the meal and a strong indicator of what was to come.   We decided to share everything, starting with the Caesar Alla ZZ salad, which is something they are known for and is prepared table side. Let me tell you that this salad did not disappoint! Both my Hubby and I agreed that this was by far the best Caesar salad we'd ever had. I am fairly positive they put crack in that dressing - it was so delicious!! It was fun to see it prepared right at our table as well.  Next, we went with a pasta course - the spicy rigatoni vodka. This was a tough sell for Hubs because he is not typically a fan of vodka sauce. Well, Carbone hit it out of the park and earned a fan! The sauce was creamy with just a touch of spice and perfectly distributed through the rigatoni. It was a small portion, and perfect to share, but we still found ourselves wanting more. Luckily, we had another course on it's way.   Our final course was a meat dish. Another signature dish, we chose to try the veal parmesan and added a side of mushrooms. This veal cutlet was HUGE! By now, we were starting to feel pretty full and we knew it wasn't likely that we would finish this behemoth! As great as everything else was so far, this was definitely the highlight of the meal. I am not normally a huge fan of veal, but Carbone may have changed my mind. The cutlet was perfectly breaded and cooked and the sauce was delicious. We could only manage to eat about half and took the rest home.  As if it couldn't get much better, the restaurant decided to surprise us with complimentary dessert! One was a lemon cheesecake and the other was a carrot cake with ginger ice cream. Both were phenomenal and more than half of both also came home with us. I believe my guy enjoyed the rest of the lemon cheesecake for breakfast the next day.  I've had dreams about this meal since then. I'd heard a lot of things about Carbone - the food isn't that great, the prices are too high, etc. Neither of those things are True at all. Not only was the food fantastic, our meal was less than $200. Yes, that is a lot of money, especially for new parents, but it was well worth it and included a $90 bottle of wine. This isn't the kind of meal that you eat every week or maybe even every month, but it was the perfect night for our special occasions and a wonderful 1st night out without baby. It's not often that we'll get to experience something like this and I am really happy that we splurged. It was a very intimate and romantic dinner, we both shut off our phones and neither of us took any pictures of the meal (this is a small miracle)!   There are a lot of great dining options in Las Vegas, but Carbone gets \"it.\" All of their attention to small details really set them apart from other restaurants - from just acknowledging our special night out, to a shot of limoncello at the end of the meal, this was a phenomenal experience.",

I have been here twice and absolutely loved each visit-- I would come more often if it wasn't on the strip (as a local I only come on the strip when necessary.)  I just have to start off with my favorite dish which is the Spicy Rigatoni. This pasta is sooo good I literally left craving more so when I came the 2nd time I knew I had to have it again! I've tried a bunch of other different options on their menu from the bread, salami, tossed salad (that is prepared in front of you), the pork chops, the chicken marinara, etc and not 1 thing disappointed me.  I recommend to save room for dessert (preferably the banana flambe) because not only is it delicious but it's also a great show to top off your meal. They also serve the rainbow cookies with limoncello and that limoncello is way too strong for me but the cookies/bread is good.  This place is great for a date night or even a group of friends. Chad was our server and he was amazing!!",

Andy St. John is the General Manager and not only professional, but gracious and an awesome storyteller....he told us the history of Carbone and explained the story behind having high backed booths and the \"Chipped\" dishes etc. You have to go to Carbone to hear the story! It was simply fabulous.  We were celebrating our sister's reunion and a combined birthday (5 of us meeting from around the country). He exceeded our expectations to make this a special evening, it will be embedded in our memories forever.  The family style of sharing foods was incredibly. Large portions, so be sure to share and try the various salads, pasta bowls and we had the Dover Sole which was to die for...Love dessert??? You will absolutely love their wide selection of choices...  This will be our go to restaurant whenever we are in Las Vegas.   Thank you everyone for making our evening so SPECIAL!",

The bar service was top notch! Do I say that only because I received free Parmesan cheese right away? Perhaps. Just kidding! The bartender was really friendly and answered all of our questions about the menu and made wonderful suggestions. We indulged on bread and cheese and then ordered a beet salad. We also split the rigatoni a la vodka. That was more than enough food. But we couldn't pass up the dessert cart so we shared a carrot cake with ginger ice cream and a lemon cheesecake (another recommendation by another member of the bar staff). Why did I eat so much? Because it was divine! Also, a group of women who were starting their bachelorette party showed up while we were there. Eventually another group left and the bartender had them move down so they wouldn't crowd us. I thought that was service that went above and beyond. I really appreciated that because it did get rowdy. Overall, this was a wonderful experience. I recommend going if you're in or near the Aria.",

Here's what we ordered:  Baked clams. Spicy Rigatoni Vodka. Meatballs. Veal Parmesan. Cheesecake.  Everything cooked to perfection. So delicious...   We shall return!!",

    "text": "There are a lot of things to love about Las Vegas, but perhaps my favorite is its in-your-face artifice.  Carbone is a perfect example of this.  It's only been open for 8 months or so, but it proudly flaunts a totally phony sense of history.  Sorry, Carbone, but I see through your act.  Even with antique chandeliers and Noo-Yawk-accented staff, you're still in a trendy hotel-casino on the Strip.  Artifice aside, Carbone is actually quite lovely.  I dropped by on a Saturday night for dinner at the bar -- which is a good option if you're can't score a reservation.  (The dining room was packed solid, but the bar wasn't busy at all.)  The bartender wasted no time taking my drink order (Pinot Grigio -- my happy wine) and bringing me a whole array of complimentary goodies to nosh on, including an enormous breadbasket (with traditional, pizza, and garlic breads), pickled cauliflower, salami plate, and parmesan pieces freshly chipped off a giant slab.  It was all very over-the-top, and it put a smile on my face.  Next, I had the beets siciliana -- a simple but delicious dish of red and yellow beets.  This is also a nice, healthful alternative to the richer, more gluttonous items on the menu.  For my entree, I had the spicy rigatoni vodka, which I enjoyed, but not as much as the beets.  I was actually taken aback at just how aggressively spicy the sauce was, and the pasta itself was a bit overcooked.    For me, even okay pasta is still enjoyable, but the main reason I was annoyed by the pasta dish is that Carbone's prices are completely out of control.  I completely understand that the Strip is a high-rent district, but charging close to $30 for a small handful of simply prepared pasta seems ridiculous to me.  I guess that phony sense of history costs mad money to maintain.    Despite my cynicism, Carbone is still a fun and tasty place for a night out.  As I was leaving, the bartender brought out some complimentary marzipan-like cookies, which were a nice touch and made me want to go back.  Maybe it's not all artifice around here.",

Being seated by one the hostesses and she managed while sliding in the table to crush my wife's toes.   My wife, in pain, was offered ice by the hostess. It was an accident; however, the damage was literally done. We asked for a moment for my wife to compose herself.  That moment was not given as mere seconds later a waiter arrived to greet us.   I not so kindly suggested that he leave.   I asked my wife if she want to stay and she said no.   We got up and left. We were not approached by a manger or by any member of staff to offer additional apologies or to render any additional service. My wife was literally limping.   Needless to say we will not be returning to this restaurant. Unfortunately this reflects poorly on not only the restaurant but the whole MGM family who hosts the restaurant within Aria  This is a shame given how much my wife was looking forward to celebrating our anniversary.",

Then you meet your captain, we had the honor of being served by Dion Bennet the man is perfect. Simply perfect. So with the service being impeccable, we ordered some dishes:  The beef carpaccio, Caesar salad, lobster ravioli, veal Marsala, tiramisu...  Each dish was excellent, a little too salty on the beef carpaccio but otherwise felt like you were eating tuna sushi, that good.   The croutons in the Caesar salad were amazing as well as the whole salad was perfectly prepared table side.   The lobster ravioli was excellent and fresh. Another fabulous dish.   Finally the best course of them all...the veal Marsala!! This was the best preparation of veal Marsala I've ever had the pleasure of having.  OMG. Worth the visit right there.   Finally the tiramisu was good not amazing but not bad either. Wish they had fresh Italian cheesecake or a strawberry cassata cake like the Grotto at the Golden Nugget downtown.  The coffee was excellent and easy to drink straight black without cream or sugar. Very aromatic and tasty.   In any case what an amazing meal topped with Italian rainbow cookies and limoncello to finish.   Couldn't be happier and can't wait to go back.   Do yourself a favor and go here. You'll thank me.",

I will first say I have never made a reservation to dine here, I always sit at the bar. With that being said, the bartenders, Kirk and Robert have made every meal here memorable and enjoyable. They also make amazing cocktails so that is a plus. There is a lounge area where you can order drinks while waiting for the bar as well.   When you sit down you are immediately served with a plate of salami, cheese picked from the cheese wheel, pickled cauliflower and garlic bread. My two favorite, must order dishes are the Caesar Salad and the Spicy Vodka Rigatoni. The salad is brought out and tossed fresh in front of you and topped with a Parm and the best garlic croutons (white anchovies can be added or served on the side). The Spicy Vodka Rigatoni is always fresh, perfectly cooked and the sauce is makes every bite better than the last. Add a meatball if you think you'll still be hungry. As for appetizers, I have had the Octopus Pizzaiolo (sous vide and then grilled) and the baked clams (served 3 ways). Both are great starters. Dessert! Everything you could wish for to satisfy your sweet tooth comes on a dessert cart for your choosing. The banana foster is really great and they made it tableside for your viewing! You also get tri colored Italian cookie at the end of every meal.   Can't wait to go back!",

I have had many of the best Veal Parms out there including the legendary \"Chef Vola\" as well as \"Sinatra\" in the Wynn and Carbone ranks at the top!!!!  The atmosphere will remind you of a classic NY Italian restaurant run by some of the Boys and the service was over the top on both occasions. Everyone in our party of 10 raved about the food!!!!  The limoncello they serve at the end of your meal adds a great finishing touch. Can't wait to return to Vegas for another trip to Carbone!!!!",

Duh! To our surprise it was mostly meat and fish.. which is fine. I ordered the only pasta.. total of 4 on menu that didn't gave any meat in it being that I'm a vegetarian.... we asked the waiter if there was like a Tomato sauce pasta my bf can order. This man after kissing our ass all night... excuse my language I'm pissed! Became very rude and dusgusting... he asked if we wanted anything else with our food and when we said no thanks because we had a show to catch he left our table never to come back... we we're in the middle of two other couples... he went to there table 7 other times and avoided us as if we had the flu. When Ian... another employee saw his disgusting behavior he stepped up and took care of us... he was amazing!!! Only good thing about this trash place!! I am sorry we aren't big eaters... I am sorry we didn't order a huge bottle of champs... I'm sorry... but that does not give that... trash waiter any right to judge us!!! He has forever ruined my experience here and I will never come back... I will tell everyone how awful he is! To end the night... out total was 60$ we have him 100 dollars tip on purpose so he can eat sh*it and he stared to kiss our behind again. U are garbage!",

It was the day before Halloween when we went so a lot of guests were taking advantage of that and wearing sneakers and jeans.    Service was top notch.  Authentic Italian dinner vibe.  They let you chat to your party after they seat the group.  I love it that they cater around the group.  They don't interrupt you while you're eating or having a conversation.  If you're looking for a quick bite, this isn't the place for you.    Every dish we ordered was delicious!  We did family style dinner.  We ordered beets siciliana, lobster ravioli, shrimp scampi, spicy rigatoni vodka, veal parmesan, angel hair AOP and a couple other dishes I can't remember the name.

Expected more for how much we were paying and was disappointed for something I thought was going to be amazing cuisine. Pretty empty for dinner time so may not be popular and tables were close together.   The lobster ravioli and the veal Parmesan were the best and really tasty. Took 30 minutes for our food to come out and it was probably because of the four orders and the veal. Lobster ravioli not filling but interesting and the veal was very Tender and perfectly \"sauced\". We didn't get to try the rib that came with it because we wanted to save it for later but it was tossed instead of boxed along with a quarter of the veal Parmesan. It was depressing how they can throw food like that. They didn't waive anything though I asked. There was no urgency to solving our issue and no sympathy. That left a bitter taste. And we will never know how that rib tasted.",

We sat and was immediately greeted by a gentleman in a purple suit who asked about drinks. We brought our own wine ($35 corkage), and he opened it up for us. No offer for a decanter (it was a great Cab), but then again we didn't ask for it either.   After that, nothing for a solid 10 minutes. It was strange. The gentleman was pouring drinks for other tables so we figured him to be the sommelier. I flagged down someone and said no one had been at our table for 10 minutes, just the somm.   Turns out, the \"somm\" was actually our waiter. He came back over and took our order. He was a very friendly Frenchman, with an accent and did a good job of the service overall.   We ordered the Caesar salad, the lobster ravioli, the steak and potato side.   Food quality was excellent. Turns out there was a \"problem\" with our steak, so they brought a spicy rigatoni vodka dish as a tweener for us complimentary. That was fantastic.   Steak finally came (took an extra 20-30 minutes) and it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked. Same with the potatoes. Found out later the steak was $120, so glad it was done correctly!   They provided a comp dessert as well for the hassle. We went with the lemon cheesecake, fantastic. It all got rounded out with some almond cookies and limoncello.   Overall, this was a very good restaurant with high quality food. The service was a bit spotty in areas, which was kind of a drag for a $350 dinner, but they did try and make amends with some complimentary dishes when the steak took a while to bring out.   Not sure if we would go again, but will probably skip the steak next time!",

Although the space is large, the booths and seating is done so well that you feel like you are in an intimate space. Request a booth with curtain as it really does make the experience quite special.  One doesn't see restaurants with table captains anymore but this accentuates the service level at Carbone. The staff was friendly, attentive without being invasive.  Our party of four had everything as family style. The tasty snacks you receive upon sitting are so good that I had to stop myself from overeating. Salami, pickled cauliflower and a wheel of Parmesan that gets a piece taken off for each person. Perfect  For the meal we had: Caesar Salad Clams three ways (bakes with uni, clams casino and a spicy pepper)  Spicy rigatoni alla vodka  Tagliatelle with mushrooms  Meatballs (off the menu) Dover sole   The Caesar salad prepared table side was one of the best I've ever had in my life. The rigatoni  alla vodka is just so good, I was tempted to lick the plate clean. The tagliatelle was an excellent accompanying side to the Dover sole. The sole was deboned and finished table side. It comes with a lemon butter caper and was perfect in texture and taste. Amazingly perfect.  I wish I had room for dessert. I did however, have room for the Italian almond cookies and lemoncello (complimentary).   The music was also a highlight. Classics but not one Frank Sinatra (it wouldve been just too hokey). Who doesn't like Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye at dinner? I look forward to engorging myself again at Carbone.",

    "text": "HOW THE MIGHTY Have Fallen... If you look at my previous review you will see it was Top Shelf and 6 months later as we return for our second foray we come hungry and excited... The excitement didn't ask to long as from start to finish this is an absolute unmitigated disaster.   We are seated and the complimentary really top shelf bread and cheese and salami is put on the table.  15 Minutes go by were 1st ones in the place at 6PM before someone comes to take our drink orders....  Wine sommelier comes and we settle on wine... 15 MORE MINUTES wine arrives we are 1/2 hour still waiting for our 'PRE DINNER COCKTAILS\" ...  FINALLY arrive as we tell the wine steward to open and let the wine breath.    I drink a particular high end whiskey neat while another at my table has a cognac.   They mix drinks up as we both take our sip we both gag as this is not what we were expecting and I don't drink Cognac.   When we notify our waiter.. What does he do.. walks over grabs the glass from my buddy grabs my glass and SWITCHES THEM... ARE YOU SERIOUS... I'm Upalled.   STRIKE 1 and a big one..  No Apology NOTHING just incompetence   Order our meal and as we are told previously its ... Appetizers / Salad / Pasta / Entree just like it's on the menu.    OK... Well here comes the Salad guy... and I ask our waiter why are you making our ceasar salad 1st.. His short abrupt nasty answer is Well thats they way the food comes out.. Pardon we just discussed a few minutes ago the order and how it will be spaced and timely.    He says \"If you don't like it you can talk to the manager\" I'm about to lose my cool until my buddy calms me down.      Salad bar is now vacant as our appetizers arrive.. and GUESS WHAT not 10 seconds after appetizers are put on the table he makes the salad which is to be shared and actually has the audacity to hand it to me to start passing it around the table..   NEVER IN MY LIFE have I seen this and now I'm on Tilt.   I ask for the Manger and now \"SANTIAGO\" our useless waiter is missing in action rest of the night we never see him again.    Manager comes over didn't get her name pleasant Asian women states \"WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU\". Sorry for everything so far.    rest of the meal passes in real active peace aside from the fact the Chicken Scarpieloo was 35.00 worth of Blah and \"Santiago\" talks us into too much food that will go to waste..  And it took 25 minutes to get more garlic bread.. \"THE KITCHEN LOST THE TICKET\"\" ... Yea ok.....   So now it's time for the check and the We took care of you...  Bill is 100% exactly what we ordered... when I find he Manager an ask what did you do for us... her answer is I you can't make this stuff up.. Well the rest of the meal was peaceful wasn't it... Honestly at this point I'm so dam angry that I simply tell her We will never be back, not that she cares but honestly the price points are so HIGH the service has to be on par with what they have the nerve to charge for very little food.     And aside from excellent clams, and very good not great veal Parm this time, the balance of food was mediocre at best and the Spicy Rigatoni which I raved about last time was in short a major disappointment.   Would not be surprised to see this place fail in the near future as IT SHOULD. I have never ever in my life been treated so rudely with no apologies whatsoever from anyone up and down the line... Medicore food, Horrible service and a 0 STAR rating....  BY ALL ACCOUNTS FOLKS STAY AWAY....SAVE YOUR MONEY.... ... An absolute rip off.",

Located inside Aria, it looks identical to the original, with a very classy decor and an Intimate feel.   Now for the food. Unfortunately, it was average at best and did not live up to expectations. I split the tortellini ragu and spicy rigatoni vodka. Both were good but not that flavorful. For main I had the bass oreganata. It was cooked well but a little salty for my liking.   Overall I would've given this place a 4, however, the waiter was a complete prick. Considering the price and location, I expect excellent service. Several times he was very rude and gave a laugh regarding menu questions. No reason to be pompous, you're serving me. Towards the end of the meal, he mustve pulled out whatever was up his a** because he became a lot friendlier. Or maybe he realized he was about to get screwed on his tip.",

We could NOT refuse dessert and tried all of them including Bananas Flambe Foster that is legit!! The General Manager, Andy St. John was so gracious.

    "text": "Excellent Italian restaurant in Vegas (heard it was based on the one in NYC). Has the old school east coast Italian restaurant feel, merged with a cool trendy restaurant in terms of feel and decor.   Did some yelp searching before going, and some frequent items many people were suggesting were the Caesar salad, meatballs, and the Vodka rigatoni pasta. Opted for these 3, and it was more than enough food, especially along with all the extras they provide there (although the waiter did seem to be pushing to add an extra meat entree). That would have just put it overboard imho (although if you come hungry, many people seem to suggest getting the veal parmesan).   Off the bat, they provide a huge basket of bread (which is quite good, particularly the marinara bread and garlic bread), along with complimentary Salami or something like that. One could get kind of full off that alone.   Caesar salad: Maybe the best ever. They make it table side, and add a little anchovie it seems like to provide some extra flavor.   Meatballs: Off the menu, but the house special. They are very good. Not sure about best ever, but definitely good.   Vodka pasta: Excellent. Not too heavy or overwhelming. Dish was almost kind of simplistic, but very good.   Didn't opt for dessert, but also complimentary, at the end, they bring you some small pieces of cake, as well as an 80 proof free bottle of Limoncello. It was quite sweet, but has a very strong kick to it. Only had a couple small glasses, but I can't even imagine how wasted you could get (and how much sugar you'd drink) pounding the whole thing.   Drinks: Told the waiter I wanted something whiskey based but not too sweet and he said he'd have something. Ended up being a rye old fashioned, which was very good.   Also: Decor is awesome. Very cool vibe to the restaurant.   Overall highly recommended! Especially if you have a 100 dollar food voucher from staying at Aria (pretty much the only thing I liked about the hotel, but that's a separate issue and review).",

The waiter replied with \"that's all your ordering!\" Wth!\" It's none of his business how much I eat! On top of that they added the dressing and the salad was super salty..... it was only lettuce! My husbands Lobster ravioli was extremely fishy! Never coming here again!!! The only thing that was ok is the bread! Overall bad choice and I wouldn't recommend!",

Away from the craziness of the casino you'll forget you're in Vegas. Beautiful restaurant space with a massive chandelier. The bar is phenomenally well stocked, especially with whiskey and Bourbon.   If you're a fan of pappy van winkle, you're in luck. They have them all.   But the food. So much to say about the food.   Yes it's expensive, but the portions are massive. The flavors are incredible, the plating is spot on.   My go to is meatballs and Angel hair. So much leftovers that I eat it for lunch and sometimes dinner the next day.   In addition to what you order, you'll get an awesome assortment of snacks. Most places you're lucky to get mediocre bread.   Here you get a plethora of bread options, pickled cauliflower, and spicy salami that will knock your socks off.   Don't forget the cookies and lemon Celo at the end of the meal.",

    "text": "Carbone was the last dinner we had in Vegas since we were feeling Italian. The decision was between Carbone and Carmine's. Carbone won because it was the closest in distance. However, despite it being in less walking distance, it was so difficult to get a reservation and it might be because the restaurant is new-ish having opened in Oct 2015. After pulling some strings, we were able to get an 8:30pm reservation instead of the the 9:45pm time slot that shows up on OpenTable.  Decor: It's dark, kind of an old-school feel especially with the music on the particular night we were there. The Temptations were on a loop and the walls looked like a dark turquoise to me in the main dining room where the bar is located. There's a bit of a diner feel to it with the black/white tile floors. The music really throws me off because of the dark decor which I don't really care for.   What we ate family-style...  Octopus appetizer: The more we eat octopus, the more we realize that most restaurants MUST be using a sous vide to cook this before finishing it off on a grill. This was still pretty delicious the way it's cooked to be tender. I definitely appreciated the thicker parts of the tentacle more than the thin parts.  Oyster appetizer: This was a special of the day not on the menu. The oysters come with a bit of a calabrian chili sauce that has a really nice kick to it.  Complimentary sides: pepperoni, pickled cauliflower, block of parm and bread. These items really did what they were supposed to: I was getting hungry while still deciding on what to order.  Rigatoni in Vodka Sauce: Ok, so I know this sounds like something pretty regular, but our waiter sold us on this and he delivered. I've never had a decent vodka or even arrabiata sauce spicy like this. It's kind of like a spicy cheesy sauce, but you really taste more heat than the cheese, almost like a fancy mac and cheese. The pasta is made in-house and is more elbow-shaped than the rigatoni I'm used to, but the shape was perfect for the pasta.   Meatballs: This pairs really well with the rigatoni. There's something about the tomato sauce. It's a little sweet, but so good that the guys at the table were sopping up the sauce with bread.  Veal Parmesan: One of the more tame dishes, I suppose, but it's good but now \"wow-amazing\" good.   Pork Chop: Probably one of the favorite meat courses of the night. Even though it's pork, it reminded me so much of steak so it's not too overcooked.   Service was terrific. We got a lot of great recommendations from our server. At the end of the meal, they served us complimentary limoncello and almond cookies. It's been a few weeks since I went and I still dream about their spicy rigatoni. Nearly worth going back to if I'm back in Vegas, but depending on if i I can get a good reservation time.",

You can really tell they pour their passion into the food. I am not going to go into the food choices but from what I had, yes all the way to dessert (Italian desserts usually suck), the food was air tight. It is the best meatball I have every had. I just marveled in amazement at it wondering where it had been all my life.   I wonder why there aren't more Italian restaurants like Carbone. It is a shame but I am fortunate to have found it as it will be my go to place for Italian from now on in Las Vegas.",

Maroon jacket clad \"table captains\", table side preparations, Sinatra playing overhead, and a stunning dining room to match.  Unfortunately, the journey to yesteryear is gonna cost you.  Prices are out of line surpassing its NYC location.  Incorrect preconception that I-talian is unpretentious and fun perhaps but $6 golf ball size meatball, $27 handful of pasta with tomato sauce, $65 veal parm, $200 porterhouse steak for two?  You draw your own conclusions.  Tip:  if you want to eat family style, ask the table captain to make recommendations.  Certain dishes are large and can be shared.    About the food, the meatball is just OK. Tender and juicy braised in a flavorful sauce but lacking seasoning.  It relies on the sauce to flavor it.   Prosciutto and Mozz solid.  Mild, thinly sliced prosciutto and hand pulled, mildly seasoned mozzarella with torn basil, EVOO and fresh cracked pepper, a pleasing finger starter.  The carpaccio, acceptable.  Thin slice of chilled beef topped with a EVOO and marinated mushrooms.  While pleasing, both dishes lacked intensity and a wow factor.  Even the EVOO lacks any kind of intensity (black pepper notes, bitterness, acidic grip).  Veal dishes are well made.  The marsala and parmesan both nice cuts, perfectly cooked, tender and milky.  The marsala properly cooked off and imparting a great woody flavor, the acidic tomato sauce on the veal parm, improving the natural sweetness of the veal.  The standout dish was the surprisingly simple spicy rigatoni.  Perfectly cooked, giant rigatoni enveloped in a tomato vodka sauce.  It's spicy but the flavor of the chili shows through and is well balanced by the gently acidic tomato sauce.  Austere and a joy to eat.  Service borders on slow even by European standards.  Good wine list focusing on Italy.  High Vegas resort markup.  In the end, OK but other options exist hailing from NYC.",

Complimentary antipasto with assorted bread was brought to the table.  We shared the baked clams appetizer, a good start.  I ordered the bass, two beautiful pieces of fish served over a cassoulet of beans and and vegetables.  My daughter ordered the Veal Marsala.  A large veal shank sat in a thick Marsala sauce.   No mushrooms and nothing accompanied the entree.  While the veal was succulent, it bore no resemblance to traditional Veal Marsala and was somewhat of a disappointment.  For dessert, we shared a Nutella tiramisu topped with a delightfully light lady finger cookie.  Complimentary limoncello and Italian rainbow cookies followed.  I managed only a few sips of the limoncello as it was a terrible vintage.  Service went from attentive to slow as the evening progressed.",

    "text": "The food is pretty good, but it's not the best option on the Strip for Italian or fine dining.   I generally enjoy the restaurants at Aria so I was expecting to love this restaurants. For locals this is one of the easier casinos to access. The parking garage is easy to access and the walk to the restaurants isn't a long one. Aria does charge for parking though.   With a reservation we were promptly seated. Without delay someone came by to take our drink orders and thus began what I'd call interesting service. Our waiter was nice, professional, and clearly had plenty of knowledge of the menu. We primarily were helped by what I assume was the assistant waiter who was very casual. His casual nature ranged from awkward to funny. Overall, the service wasn't bad, but it wasn't the excellent service I'm accustomed to receiving at similar restaurants on the Strip.  The best part of the restaurant was all of the complimentary items that are part of the dining experience. Before the meal we were served a bread basket with a nice variety of breads, fresh parmesan-reggiano, salami, and a marinated cauliflower. All of this was very tasty. At the end of the meal we were served rainbow cookies and Limoncello. The rainbow cookies had amazing flavor, but were very dry. The Limoncello was deliciously sweet and dangerously strong. I thought that all of this was a very nice touch and helped balance out the prices.  My husband and I shared a House Chopped Salad before our meals. It was plenty to share between the two of us and was from a basic salad. The salad included a lot of interesting ingredients and was pretty good. Next time I'd get the Caesar Salad since it's prepared tableside. For our entrees we ordered Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and Pork Chop & Peppers. The rigatoni was perfectly prepared and the sauce on top was delicious with the perfect amount of spiciness. The pork chop and peppers came pre-sliced and had a nice flavor with both the meat and the peppers on top. It was a fattier cut of meat which seems to be Carbone's style and I didn't care for that.  Dessert was the highlight of the entire meal. My friend and I shared the NY Style Cheesecake. The cheesecake was creamy and had the perfect flavor. On the bottom was a thin layer of lemon for some added flavor. I don't usually care for cheesecake, but I would never order anything else for dessert at Carbone after eating this cheesecake.",

Tried the foie gras Venezia which was grilled, rich and tasty; the gemelli di Rabe which is similar to fusilli with pesto sauce (without pine nuts)- so fresh and refreshing!  Thankfully Mario's meatballs are available at dinner time- and are chunky and delicious!  Capped off the meal with the light New York style lemon cheesecake for dessert  The Major Food Group does a great job in creating the atmosphere and delivering a consistently fun and outstanding experience. Service is always a priority too. I loved everything about Carbone Las Vegas (inside the Aria hotel on the strip) and a private room is available for larger, private functions.",

Walking in, I liked the plush vs opulent atmosphere and decor. I felt already that the service would be great. Ordered an old fashioned while I studied the menu. Luckily, it wasn't a novel. There weren't many pasta choices - a bit disappointing. With the help of both the waiter and sommelier, I was convinced to try the house specialty - spicy rigotoni vodka. I also ordered the carpaccio piemontese as a starter and a half bottle of 2013 tommasi amarone. The sommelier offered to decant the amarone which was nice and opened up the wine. The carpaccio was really nice and was offered a chunk of  parmesan cheese. I asked and got some aged balsamic to go along. The pasta was well prepared. But there was only so much you can do with a vodka sauce. Overall, a great experience. Would recommend coming here with at least two others to fully sample the menu.",

The bus boys were sooo nice, they offered to take pictures, they made the experience great!  So I ordered the table side ceasar salad, which the waiter didn't think was good choice, but i wanted it anyways, besides the unenthusiastic table side \"show\" I loved the flavor, extra cheese and croutons that melt in your mouth   The spicy rigatoni, yes it's True the portion is small but it's rich and so delicious, leaves you satisfied   Also can't forget the bread basket and pickled cali flower, I could sit and eat that all night with some wine, so fresh so good!!!  Love the playlist of music Aplus plus  Love the little private booths that outline the restaurant, not sure I would have loved the experience as much sitting in a regular table in middle of room.

The portions are very small and definitely not\"family style\" as they suggest. We could literally count the amount of pasta they placed on the dish. Basically you're paying $39 for an appetizer. It's Vegas and it's in the Aria so you're paying more anyways but I just couldn't get over the how average the food was and the portion size was laughable.

The dishes are really good for sharing, giving you an option to try more things on the menu. We started with a caprese salad and the server cuts their house made mozarella cheese right in front of you and oh my God; the flavor is beyond. Service is exceptional, they really enhanced our lovely stay. The ambiance of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, red and gold velvet booths, chandelier lighting and a luxurious feeling. Sorry I missed the pictures but my husband and I were having and exceptional time that I didn't even care about taking my cellphone out so you can get an idea of how good it was. Each penny is worth it so please come here if you have the opportunity.",

He was great! The rest of the wait staff  was also very attentive. Our water was always full. This is a nice fancy restaurant. Non-fussy children above the age of 6 should be okay.

A plate with Parmesan cheese cut from a large block behind the counter, it was soooo good. Several types of delicious bread, salami and pickled cauliflower were also presented. All was so good, I had to hold myself from eating it so I wouldn't be too full for the actual order.  We had the spicy rigatoni vodka which was delicious and not too spicy but just a perfect kick. Then we had lobster fra diavolo. It was sooo good!   The whole experience was wonderful and food was amazing. No flaws. Just waw. The way they prepare plates in front of tables: our dish, but I also saw the flambe bananas somewhere, and the Caesar salad ...  Would come here anytime. I loved it!",

    "text": "We had such a great experience here at Carbone. We had a group of 10 people and the service was pretty impressive. We ordered family style off the menu and each got half a serving of their famous spicy rigatoni vodka pasta. This pasta was one of the best and perfectly cooked pastas I've ever had in my life. I would go back specifically just for this dish. Perfectly al dented and the right amount of spice and flavor. I'm drooling just thinking of it. All our other dishes were great. The Carpaccio was another amazing must try dish. The prawn scampi was a bit heavy to have (we got 1 prawn per person) I think we could have gotten away with sharing one prawn per 2-3 people since they're so huge! Service couldn't have been better all around from every single staff member we dealt with. I do have to agree with some of the reviews on here that say that the waiters pressure you to buy more food. Our waiter suggested we order way more food than we needed. Also threw in sides that we never asked for.",

We split the spicy rigatoni a la vodka which was divine.  My friend had the veal and I had the steak, both cooked to perfection.  We didn't even think to take pictures, we just pounced on each plate as it was served to us, the food was so good.  The meal ended with limoncello and Italian cookies.     The service was excellent.  Our waiter was great at helping us to select the perfect wine to compliment our meal.    For the budget conscience, the food is a bit pricey, but worth every penny.

    "text": "For starters, the hostess are so snobbish it's actually comical. Other than self appointed owners/ hostess, the ambiance is very nice and welcoming. It's dimly lit with Frank Sinatra songs entertaining you in the background. I had the ever so popular Rigatoni in a spicy vodka sauce. It was pleasant and the pasta tasted fresh but it honestly wasn't all that I expected it to be.   The Tiramisu came for dessert and while it was nice to try a new version of the delicious classic, I felt the hints of orange from the Grand Mariner were too over powering and the dessert itself was more of a drier cake than the traditional creamy goodness you would expect. It was a Nutella Tiramisu but I didn't taste much at all, not enough to redo the original recipe.   Service was on the fair to good side, I was left alone a little too much for my liking and would have preferred not to have to wait endlessly till their return before I was able to ask for something.   A little glass of Limoncello was offered at the end as well as a bite of a rainbow cookie. Both lacking the right flavors in my opinion. For a total bill of $86 for one person it felt a little much for the food I received as well as the lack of attention and amateur behavior from the hostess.  Would I return? Possibly, but it wasn't memorable enough to recommend it to anyone I know.",

Our server was clearly disappointed that our group was not particularly hungry; his reaction was unfortunate, as it cast a pall over the evening. It's not as though we didn't order dishes for everyone and bottles of wine. Two of our party commented that the experience wasn't as pleasurable as it had been on their last visit.  I didn't enjoy my beet salad as the taste was off. The pasta dishes were fine, but again, not great. The selections in the bread basket were delicious and plentiful.  After the meal they brought complimentary desserts for the birthday celebrants and limoncello. These were the highlights of the meal.  A lot of pomp and pageantry layered over good but not exceptional food. Vegas strip prices.",

    "text": "My aunt and my mom were in town for the New Year and wanted me to pick out a nice restaurant to eat on NYE. I heard good things about this place, so we decided to come here. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.  For appetizers, we ordered the baked clams, beets, and foie grais. The baked clams were nine pieces cooked in three different ways. They weren't described to us when they brought the dish, but the one without the breading was the only flavor that was good. The other two ways with the breading had strange tastes to it, and the texture was weird because the breading was soggy. The beets were alright, but it needed more flavor to it. It was literally all beets. They could've at least thrown in more fruit or something else to make it more unique. The foie gras was decent... The sauteed onions paired well with the foie gras, but it was nothing special.  For my entree, I ordered the lobster ravioli. When it came out, I was happy to see a good amount of lobster meat with a nice creamy sauce. I took one bite and cringed. I almost spat it back out. I don't know if the lobster was old or there was some type of herb in the sauce, but it made my stomach really upset. I immediately lost my appetite. It tasted really off and gross. What was worse? The server never came back to check on us. And when the busser came up to pick up the dish, he didn't even ask why it looked like I only took one bite. He didn't even ask me how it was. Horrible service. I wanted to send the dish back (which I never do at restaurants) but I was so upset how something with a $40 price tag could taste so bad. I wanted to swap it out for another dish, but they didn't even give me a chance. My mom ordered the Rib eye Diana, which she said was decent. I tried it, and agreed. It wasn't anything special. My aunt got the Bass Oreganata, which she said was just okay. They both agreed that we should've picked somewhere else.  Overall, I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. We could've possibly ordered the wrong things, but why wasn't one thing GOOD? Their menu isn't that big, so how could six items all be misses? My stomach still felt weird from the sauce of the ravioli for a whole hour after we left the restaurant.   The only reason why I gave this place two stars instead of one was because the host was very nice and helpful. Our friend was actually supposed to join us, but couldn't bypass strict security to enter the parking lot because it was NYE. The host really tried to help us out with that. We really appreciated that.",

Even during the week I would recommend making reservations as it was pretty busy during our dining experience.  Since our friends made the reservations, we were seated without hesitation.  Our main waiter for the evening was very courteous and professional.  His counterpart, who assisted table duties, was a little off color for this dining establishment.  It almost became comical by the end of the night to see what he would say next.   A lovely variety of bread, fresh parmesan, italian meat and cauliflower are all brought to each table compliments of the restaurant.  It was actually surprising how much is bought out before placing any food orders. With all of these goodies I decided to skip the salad and order the Veal Parmesan.  This entree is huge with plenty to take home for leftovers.  The sauce could have used a bit more flavor to brighten the dish.  The veal was good but not the best of quality I was expecting.    Since I was dining with the dessert queen, we decided to split the NY Cheesecake.  It was very creamy with a hint of lemon to create a delicious flavor.  I would absolutely order this again.  The complimentary tricolored cakes brought out were pretty but dry.  I did however appreciate all of the generosity.  But they just keep on giving... a complimentary bottle of limoncello is also presented to the table.  Now since I was driving I decided to pass.  From our friends at the table it was pretty strong so drink slowly!  I enjoyed my evening here but I hope the quality improves.",

    "text": "So was in vegas for a trip and was going to see a cirque du soleil show later in the evening. I was hoping to grab some food prior to the show and after a bit of searching I saw this joint pop within a reasonable walking distance to the show. I also recognized the name from its chefs and figured it was worth a shot given I had not had the opportunity to partake in their food before. This joint is located in Aria and it is quite the \"old school\" traditional feel with the red accents in the room making me feel I was walking into a mafia den and waiting for someone to kick down the door to use their tommy gun.... Maybe ive been watching too many movies. But I digress, the service is on point and quite friendly throughout the entire meal and we were seated promptly for our dinner reservation.  As part of their opening plates, they provide a basket of bread, a small plate of salami, and some pickled vegetables which was a nice touch. The bread basket was delicious with the focaccia being quite delicious and my favorite. The drinks are plentiful here with a fully stocked bar so they kept coming throughout the meal. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the famous meatballs, the famous rigatoni, and the veal Parmesan dish. The meatballs were out first and they were juicy and packed with flavor. Really solid meatballs and a great way to start the meal. The rigatoni was cooked great and perfectly al dente with the sauce being made really well making you yearn for more bites of it. You can choose to add a protein to it with a charge of course. The veal Parmesan was massive and came out with good presentation with the bone on the side. The veal was cooked well although I wish the meat was a bit more tender but I really appreciated the fact that the breading was not too overpowering. We were stuffed with the  meal after these dishes so were unable to try the dessert but it looked solid as well.  All in all, this is a solid spot for dinner and definitely hits the mark for just good solid traditional Italian food. This is definitely worth a visit if you are searching for this criteria and a spot worthy of its location in aria.",

I'm not sure if our particular waitress (Team 4) was having an off-night but she was pretty rude to us. Her facial expressions alone were comical as she was supremely upset that she couldn't force us into ordering anything.   We simply wanted a quick meal, and I get that maybe our table might have not been as profitable as her other tables, but get it together or ask for someone else to serve us. We had a gluten-free diner with us and it took quite a bit of questioning to figure out what to order. We each ended up ordering the spicy rigatoni which is the sole reason I am giving them 3 stars. This dish is out of this world! I ordered the meatballs and that was pretty filling as a whole meal.   The decor is nice, and while the rest of the staff seemed professional there there seems to be something I can't quite put my finger on about why the overall experience was lacking. I hope my next experience is better as I'd love to eat that rigatoni dish again!",

We didn't do a traditional ordering that they suggest - we did the octopus appetizer, tableside Ceasar salad, and three of us did a small pasta dish (rigatoni with vodka sauce and lobster ravioli) while one of us did veal parmesean. After eating they give you complimentary limoncello for your table. We all liked our food but nothing really blew us out of the water. I would 100% recommend ordering the tableside Ceasar though because that was great.  The Carbone experience/service was amzing but I think we all expected to be a little more impressed when it came to the food. I'd still recommend but probably don't need to come back if I'm ever visiting again.",

We had a Vegan with us and he went above and beyond to make her feel comfortable at every course right along with us, the carnivores.   The food was delicious. We did a family style sharing. The caesar said was crazy good. Made right at the table. We also had a beet salad, the beef carpaccio with the caesar salad.  . All were delicious and flawless.   We shared the roasted chicken, the rib eye and a spicy penne. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and so was the chicken. There were no dry spots or burnt ends.   Dessert was the lady finger cake and the carrot cake. The carrot cake was great! They also dropped a bottle of limoncello at the table for us. On the way out we met Joseph the manager. He was so nice to take the time to speak to me. He was incredibly gracious.   Overall I cannot wait to go back and i have been telling people about it since we went.

My mom and I were both forcing pieces down and they were fatty and chewy and gross. My mom and I decided it was time to leave bc the food was so bad. We did not complain bc we figured it was pointless (I had my baby with me and we didn't have time to deal with speaking to a manager.)  I do not recommend this restaurant for anything but pasta and drinks. Save your $64, skip the veal, in fact, save $200, skip the restaurant and go somewhere else altogether.

I got lucky and was able to sit down and I proceeded to have the most lovely meal and wonderful service. Kirk was very knowledgeable and kind and he answered any questions I had in detail. I had the prosciutto & mozzarella, just trust me and GET IT. There are three kinds of prosciutto and the mozzarella is hand cut over the top in front of you. I got the Angel Hair AOP this time which was very good, but I do prefer the spicy rigatoni vodka. I ate all of the cheese, salami, bread and pickled cauliflower they gave me - what is in that cauliflower?! It's so good. They also gave me some rainbow cookies for dessert which was perfect. I enjoyed it so much that I came right back for dinner the following night and Kirk remembered my name, what I ordered and my preferences!",

    "text": "BRAVO so excited to report on what a great restaurant this is. It includes everything as far as what defines an amazing restaurant experience. We arrived at about 9:45 PM on Thursday evening. It was our last night in Vegas. I was there on a work trip and my fiance came to meet me. We were looking to celebrate a night out in Vegas together. We had wine across the way at Bardot,  which is another great restaurant. We headed over to our reservation and had to wait a few minutes before walking in. The staff was lovely and had great customer service. The restaurant is much bigger than I expected. We walked through three different rooms, each carrying a ambience but with the overtone of old-fashioned, Italian style. We headed to the back where there are separate booths. It was so cool. My fiance and I immediately looked at each other and knew we were going to have a fantastic experience. The aromas of garlic, Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce hit you right away. As soon as we sat down we grew increasingly more and more hungry. They serve you water and put a big chunk of Parmesan cheese in front of you. Old-school, Italian. The place was coming down from being busy earlier. You could tell that everyone was running around. Our waiter told us that we just missed a party of 40. There were a few menu items that were off the table so I'll server told us this right after that. There was no specials, but he recommended a few dishes. He then, got busy so Eric came over, assuming he is a manager to take our orders. He recommended the rigatoni vodka penne because that is the most popular item on the menu. I try to avoid heavier sauces so we went with the pesto, sausage, and broccoli dish. Forgive my Italian. We also got the caprese salad. I was surprised at how big the portions were. The caprese salad is amazing and I definitely recommend getting those two dishes together. They bring over amazing garlic bread as well as a pizza bread. Everything tasted so amazing together. When we were done, they brought over the dessert cart - but we were pretty stuffed. Although, we did not order dessert - the servers brought us over an Italian flag made out of chocolate anyways complimented with some limoncello. One of the servers came over and accidentally knocked limoncello on my fiance's lap. He felt so bad. Other than that, this was a perfect experience. Everything that we got was $100. We also got red and white wine. The prices are so reasonable for how delicious it is and how fancy a restaurant it is. I highly recommend that no matter where your staying in Vegas, you dine here. Manja! Manja!",

We heard amazing things about this restaurant and were blown away by the food, atmosphere and service. We had one of the best experiences at Carbone.  The food was fresh, quality ingredients and very tasty. High quality food at a great price point.  The pasta and meatballs were delicious. The house chopped salad was unique and used high quality ingredients.  The desserts and house limoncello were mouth watering. The atmosphere is upscale and trendy.  The service provided by Jessica, Richard, and Dion was superb! Jessica made arrangements at Jewel nightclub for our group. Richard and Dion were attentive, professional and fun to be around. Thank you all for the amazing memories that we have!  My group and I would definitely recommend that you make reservations at Carbone.",

We had the Carpaccio, Caesar salad, penne with vodka and then the chicken parmesan. It was all fantastic. We ended the night with a cheesecake which was light and delicious. The ambience was perfect and service was on point. There was a couple of reviews saying that the plates were chipped... and yes some of the plates are chipped because they are actually imported from Italy. It adds to the charm! This was one of the best meals I have had in many many years. Will absolutely be returning.  Of all the places we ate in Las Vegas this was by far the best .   My only suggestion is that allow yourself plenty of time to park and get to the restaurant because it takes a good 20 minutes to do so.",

I had the chopped salad and then the wife ordered the pene a la vodka which is her absolute favorite. I had the special for the night which was ravioli with ragu. WOW it was unreal. We will stay in the Aria next time (again) just so we have easier access to Carbone.   I referred this place to my neighbor and he went two nights in a row he loved it so much!

The prices are definitely high so started expecting a lot. It started off right with the servers bringing fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese, bread, spicy salami, and pickled cauliflower.   My friend and I were deciding between a number of dishes and they recommended the spicy rigatoni vodka... It was amazing. Perfectly al dente, delicious sauce, full flavors even without any meat. We then shared the dover, which was well cooked - although maybe a tad high on the butter and capers.   We ended the night with tiramisu and (complimentary) Limon cello.   Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I will begin with I understand that most fine dining restaurants on the strip are very expensive, but with that high cost usually comes with a very unique and amazing dining experience.  Unfortunately, with Carbone this was not the case. I will start with some positive marks the service was good and so was the carpacio. Now, the not so nice. We order a 50 ounce steak for $450.00. For what was supposed to be an American Wagyu. When the steak came out it had about 24 ounces of meat. The rest was fat and convective tissue which was not edible. We mentioned our concerns and issues with the steak. Thinking the restaurant was gonna make good for the issue they brought out a smaller steak which was better than the first steak. While we were waiting they brought out a bottle of wine and poured 2 glasses and left the bottle which at first we thought was a nice gesture until another waiter came and poured it into the other glasses wine which was a different and very expensive wine which got ruined. Finally, THE BILL. The bill not only had both steaks on it and the restaurant was not going to originally make good for their bad $450.00 steak. But also charged for the bottle wine that no one ordered that ruined 3 glasses of wine. We had to request a manager to make things right and the bill was only then adjusted. I will conclude with after having many wonderful dinners on the strip over the last 15 years I would say this goes down as one of the worst meals.",

The fact that they consider this place fine dining ($$$$) (well that part is correct because of their prices), a \"romantic\" intimate italian restaurant it is not.  The music playing was 40-50's style doo-wap and blaring way too loud, lighting was way too bright, and considering it was supposed to be \"fine dining\" (did I miss something on the dress code?), people were dressed in everything from dressy to skullcaps and shorts.  Not exactly what we had in mind.   Another thing...the menu is set up to share and the way it was explained to us was that from each category (like apps, salads, entrees, etc.) you were to pick one that you would share with someone else.  Between the four of us, we had so much food that ended up being left and wasted because we couldn't take it with us.  In reality we could all have just ordered one item from each category to feed all four of us.  Also, don't ask for a glass of wine without knowing the price per glass either.  We felt overcharged on that one.  All my husband wanted was a glass of red house wine.  The server should have indicated that he was pouring some fine vintage because that 2-inch amount of wine in the wine glass was $38.  Oh well.  We won't be back but if ever we are, I would not recommend this restaurant for what we had in mind for a romantic setting and intimate atmosphere.",

Had 9:30pm dinner reservations for a party of 10. Coincidentally, and unbeknown to us and to our dismay, Drake was having dinner at 9:30 too! Staff was inattentive, very disorganized and only concerned with Drake. Once seated, we ordered drinks, then entrees. We were served our drinks and then waited and waited and waited.... Our food took forever to come out. Waitstaff was soo visibly busy catering to Drake and his entourage that we were left unattended and waiting for well over an hour! When I questioned the waiter, he said, the \"pork chop takes a really long time to cook\". Meanwhile, half of our party ordered pasta, some of which never even made it to the table. By the time most of the food came out, we were all disgusted with the service and ready to leave. We requested the check, expressed our dissatisfaction, left the food sitting on the table, paid for our drinks and left. Carbone should value all their customers. In a city that is so heavily service dependent, and at their price point, Carbone completely drops the ball! When I reiterated to the manager how disappointing the experience was, the manager offered up nothing more than an empty apology and stated that \"they haven't been doing well lately.\" For all their grandeur, Carbone lacks the hospitality and the decorum expected of an upscale, classy restaurant. Fortunately, Vegas like NYC has a plethora of really good restaurants. Why settle for poor service? If you want upscale Italian with good service and good food, do yourself a favor, skip this spot and head over to Lago, The Giada or Lavo. Won't be returning to Carbone in Vegas or NYC!!",

We walked into a smelly traditional Italian restaurant at a different hotel famous for good food, and ultimately walked out after drinking their water. We needed good good and atmosphere both.   On to the Aria / close to our hotel / to cash in a few stray vouchers before exiting the Hot and Windy City.  Surprise!  With no reservation the wait was supposed to be a half hour. But the hostess with the mostess found us outside pretty quickly and informed us of an open table. Thanks!  Walking back into the Chandelier Room I was excited as I had seen it online and its gorgeous! Our pretty gold round booth was right under it. Nice!    Ok. Then we had to decide on the food. Seemed difficult at first but then out pops Eric and Joe (our wait team!) to make recommendations and be super friendly. And the really cool thing?  They were right in their recommendations. Everything was excellent.   Now as if the pasta was not delicious enough, out comes this Lemon Cheesecake - I mean out of this Lemon World.  Add a little Limoncello - made in house - and you are in Lemon heaven.   Ok. Now meet the GM. Gotta tell him how impressed we were - and he is super cool. A Vegas guy himself - but gives New York credit for the wonderful people in the kitchen.   Say hi to him while your there - his name is Joseph and he's destined to make this the best restaurant in Vegas / if it's not already.",

    "text": "Carbone has become a must visit each and every time I am in Las Vegas.  This update deals with visits 5 and 6.  Visit 5 was a special trip to celebrate my sisters 50th birthday.  I found the General Managers (Andy) contact information on Yelp and decided to reach out to see what he thought about making my sisters evening special.  Andy replied immediately and provided 3 great additions to our evening.  The shocking part was that Andy was adding these items to our dinner complimentary which was not at all expected.  On the evening it was obvious that Andy had briefed his staff as each and every one of them made sure to make my sisters evening special.  It was by far the highlight of the trip.  My 6th visit was New Years Eve.  I had made a critical mistake of leaving our booking to late and Carbone was fully booked.  I contacted Andy and without hesitation he fit us in to his already booked restaurant. He even went so far as to put us in a private booth in the Red room.  The food as always was spectacular and I had mentioned in my first review that it was pricey.  in hindsight that was my fault as we ordered way to much food.  As each visit has pasted I have refined our order to where frankly is has become very affordable for the great food and fantastic experience.  What has made it our go to is Andy and the treatment we receive.  I suspect he provides that level of service to all his guest...but I know it certainly makes us feel special.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Very good service and good food. All the pasta was fresh and the sauces were very good. The server (sorry forgot his name) was very helpful and made ordering stress free. With his thick Italian accent it made the evening that more fun.  His description of the food, the vass amount of rums and the tasty desserts really helped us along for our choices.  Though this place is a bit pricey it sure was a good experience. Try it, so you can see for yourself",
