    "text": "My first time, and probably my last time coming here. I did enjoy the rice to fish ratio and it felt like I was really getting my money's worth. Service wasn't bad, but the blaring of \"happy birthday\" to the point where our server couldn't hear us was a bit obnoxious. However, our bill is what caused me to actually write a review on here for the first time.  Walked in with a party of five. The menu we got stated that AYCE required gratuity only for parties of 6 or more. When we got our bill, we were charged gratuity and when we asked why, they stated they changed their policy a few months ago and brought out a different menu with the six whited out and replaced with five. The hostess then took our menu away - which still stated AYCE gratuity is required for parties of 6 or more - to seemingly \"fix\" their error. Very disappointed that we had to pay that especially since the notice was obviously not fixed on every menu and the website was not updated to notify customers of this change.  You can also clearly see that it states gratuity for parties of six or more people in a picture from another reviewer here, and that review was only 17 days old.",

    "text": "I ate here for lunch on a Saturday with a group of 9. We were seated quickly after they arranged tables for us. We were given a slip to order from but the lunch and dinner options were confusing to figure out. Food did take a while for certain items! Food we ordered at the beginning never showed up and when we went to cancel, it was finally ready and we couldn't cancel anymore.  The service was terrible! There was literally one or two servers for this whole place. We were thirsty so many times and kept asking for our cups to be refilled. A busboy finally came by to fill our cups, but one pitcher wasn't enough. He came by with 2 pitchers at one point!  We paid and waited to order our ice cream. We waited 15-20mins for them to pick up the check and take our dessert order before we just got up and left. We were there a total of 2+ hours.  The food itself actually wasn't too bad. The ratio of rice to fish for the nigiri was good! Normally most places give you too much rice or equal amounts of both. Most dishes were too saucy. After a while, you get sick of eating this food.  Remember that you shouldn't order more than you can handle! Order as you go or you'll get too much food. Sometimes you won't even remember what you ordered or what an item is.  Maybe I'll give it another try.. if I ever come back!",

It either comes with sauce (which tastes really really good) or without sauce. I prefer the ones with sauce! What stood out to me the most was the ocean trout and albacore! Those were my favorites! They have great appetizers to start with or to have during your dinner too. Spicy garlic edamame was very spicy and garlicy! It was soooo yummy! Baked green mussels were so delicious. Everything we ordered was very tasty and good quality for ayce. What made this first time experience a little disappointing was the service. Our server kept forgetting our orders and she looked confused most of the time. At first, when she forgot our orders the first few times, we kinda let it go but then she kept forgetting. We ordered the one time order of oysters and we never got them. We didn't feel like asking for them again so we let it go. The service just needs some improvement, other than that the meal was very good",

A lot to choose from. -Free Dessert is included per person who are doing AYCE. -Service is quick and the staff is very attentive. -Ambience is upbeat with Kpop music videos playing continuously. -There is an option to sit at the Sushi Bar.  FYI: -Like most Sushi restaurants, there is a time limit for AYCE's Lunch & Dinner. -Sharing is NOT Allowed among NON-AYCE diners.",

Open a restaurant in Norcal please !!  $20.95 for lunch Open - 4pm $25.95 for dinner 4pm - closing   First thing when you walk in you will notice their amazing interior ! So modern and artistic !! Even their bathrooms look cute. Their extensive menus are colorful and organized into sections. Plenty to choose from. They have some very silly names for their dishes. I really like that you can ask for half orders on sushi rolls so you can try more selections. I went for all the sushi and nigiri. Also you DO NOT have to do ayce.   The fish to rice portion is on point  ! Perfect! Most ayce try to pack as much rice as they could in your sushi/nigiri. But not this place !! Yall the MVP!! Also the fish is fresh too!!   If you go for dinner try all their specials on the menu - usually one order per person only. There are also specials on the hanging chalkboard. They are all pretty good ! Gotta eat your money's worth.   Free dessert included! Try their mini honey toast. Basically a hawaiian sweet roll drizzled with honey and topped with ice cream.   The service was good. Always came to check up on us. Kept food coming constantly and took away empty plates. When you order make sure to double check the order with them at the end! Wouldn't want to be missing any yummy dish!   Overall fresh fish & ayce that is well worth the price !! Left with a very happy and full stomach. Felt like I could barely walk out of the restaurant haha Definitely will be back each time I'm in Vegas !",

I highly recommend getting dinner pricing because they have so many goodies on there that you can't get with lunch pricing.  Atmsosphere is date night worthy and great value for the money.   You can do half rolls on most of their rolls! Which is awesome for trying new things out. Of course the nigiri is my favorite and really puts this place above the rest!",

    "text": "So, this is my first review so u kno it's bad. I like going out to eat & tryin new things. I'm sorry I went here. So was going to give it a 1 star but I had a great interaction with a female server.  I'm gonna break it down to ya..  My homegirl & I got there & 11:15pm. The guy was like last call is at 11:20pm. At that point I didn't even want to eat there no more, but after all the driving around lookin for something to eat & seeing they had curry katsu chicken I decided to place my order. He lowkey told us that at this time u got to get take out. We ordered curry katsu chicken, shrimp fried rice, yaki udon noodles, & a lobster roll. While he was taking our order I just felt those bad vibes.  Anyways, he told us it will be 15min... At this time my friend & I chopped it up with one of the servers & she was super chill. When our order was ready we left. When we got home about 5min later. I was disappointed when I looked at my food. My curry katsu looked weak af & nothing like the picture. The proportion was off. It was good; the curry chicken & the rice. Yes, I ate it all.  Now, the shrimp fried rice smh again nothing like the picture + the proportion was off. The \"shrimp\" in my fried rice looked like chopped off breaded fried shrimp legs. Yes, I ate it all bc I was hungry. For the yaki udon noodles aka yucki.... no only did he not tell us that they were spicy ( he could even describe it to my friend when she asked what comes mixed with it ) but it was more of a soup than stir fried. No, I didn't eat it all bc I'm trying to save my booty.  Oh & the lobster roll looked like a lobster ball of idk what.  My total came out to $34 I gave him $40 With service in all it was definitely worth $15 not $40",

    "text": "This is the second Japanese restaurant we've discovered has AYCE.  And we meant to eat at Tokyo Station but they're temporarily closed.  Luckily this plaza is full of delish looking grub joints.  Even though all the flashy bright happy restaurant signs seem to compete with each other, we decided on this one Sushi Neko tucked in the corner.  But walk inside and it's a plethora of mixed art and objects!  Which one catches your eye?  I like the girl dressed in traditional with her hair up, looking like she just beat you in a breakdance competition.  But the art in this restaurant made me wanna take my time eating to gaze at everything.  So I've been upstairs to a18 karaoke bar.  Their menu design is exactly the same as Sushi Neko's but different menu items.  Sushi Neko's cool menu items - some even funny... Who's Your Daddy sushi roll... Did NOT try that one; nor the I Love My Ass, Wet Dream, or Playboy rolls. OMGarsh only in Vegas - almost hilarious.  My other brain thinks ummm this is food guys keep it decent.  Sushi Neko has gained themselves some new fans though!  Not just cuz of AYCE but especially for the allowance of half orders.  Yep... advantage!!!  Try more selections.  I've never known ANY place to do this.  Got our attention!  I prefer nigiri, since they're simple and easier to eat.  But their rolls look fun and appetizing!  We enjoyed the popcorn lobster roll and chanel roll.    Our servers were super pleasant.  Filled our waters, and checked on our orders, cleared off empty dishes.  The wait from ordering to table delivery was pretty quick.  Then again we had a late dinner on Sunday evening and it wasn't crazy busy.    For desserts, Ness tried the green tea panna cotta and mini honey toast.  I tasted the panna cotta but for whatever reason my taste buds were not picking up the flavor of green tea.  I may have been sushi'd out.  It was very light so my suggestion is to have dessert first!  ;)  And the mini honey toast is a sweet roll with honey, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  That can be made at home; but here it can be ordered with AYCE.  Overall a nice dining experience at Sushi Neko. Ate really well yesterday.  Healthy protein choice of fish.  And we shall return :)",

    "text": "There are so many sushi AYCE places out here in Vegas.  As a result, I just chose one of the new places - Sushi Neko.  One of the cool things about this place is that they don't limit the number of rounds that you can order, which obviously is awesome because you can better gauge how much more you can handle/want to eat.  I don't know if there was a time limit or not, but it was nice that the food came out pretty quickly.  One of my biggest sushi AYCE peeves is that subsequent rounds take forever to come out, but I was glad that this was not the case here.  Well, I guess that the restaurant had maybe 3-4 other tables occupied, so that could be a reason why food came out super fast.  But, overall, the service was very good.  The waiters were very friendly, took dirty plates away quickly, and also got all of my orders correctly.  The menu is very, very big so it was definitely difficult to pick which things to eat.  There was everything from nigiri to BBQ skewers to mini udon bowls.  Big mistake on my part was I went to eat by myself, therefore, I didn't get to try as many things as I would have wanted.  Be sure to bring friends when you go so that you can try everything!  On to the food - the nigiri was overall very good.  Salmon belly and unagi are my favorites and they absolutely did not disappoint.  The fish to rice ratio was amazing, which is the one thing about a sushi restaurant that can either make or break my experience.  Unfortunately, the yellowtail was a little icy (frozen fish, perhaps).  I was not a fan of that one and would not get it again for that reason.  The appetizers were average - I had miso soup, salad, and calamri.  The miso was a little on the salty side.  Salad was nothing special, but was refreshing.  The calamari was served with a generic sweet chili sauce, which was mediocre.  Unfortunately, what was most disappointing for me was the actual rolls.  They were drenched in sauces and mayonnaise; it was so excessive that it ruined the experience of eating the fish.  If I were to come back, I'd either stick to just nigiri or pick rolls that didn't come with some sort of sauce.  A big perk is that there are a handful of desserts that you can choose from at the end of your meal.  I got the mango mochi and the tempura ice cream, which both were very delicious!  An AYCE meal here costs $21 at lunch and $26 at dinner, which is pretty typical for any AYCE sushi place.  I'm not sure if Vegas has better AYCE sushi places out here, but this place is pretty good and I'd definitely come back and get a ton of nigiri.",

    "text": "Located in Chinatown, Sushi Neko is the sister restaurant of Sakana. It's a convenient location for those who visit Chinatown. The restaurant is big and since it's still new, there is no long waits to get a table. I was happy to see the amazing  hispanic waiter from Sakana is now working at Neko.   The food here is just as great as Sakana. I was glad to see the consistency of their recipes. The ratio of rice to fish is always what keeps me coming back to this restaurant. The fish is very fresh and sliced in large pieces. They give you little rice so you can enjoy and eat as much as you want without getting full on rice.  Some recommendations:  Nigiri- Salmon Belly (w/ Fresh Wasabi), salmon, unagi, yellowtail, ocean trout, super white tuna  Appetizers- Creamy shrimp, spicy edamame, miso soup, house salad, the shit  Rolls- Salmon skin handroll, japanese lasagna",

Talking with our server he told us its the same owners as Sakana. Def more fish to rice ratio! Good! and best of all NO WAIT! Their service is pretty good too but I mean it was pretty empty.  I'm thinking because they're fairly new its not super busy just yet.   They have a very beautiful mural painted on the walls and spirited away themed it looks like with some of the artwork and they're playing it on the tv as well.  Loving the ambience here and the food is pretty good too. I really like the variety here. I believe the menu is basically the same as Sakana.  Salmon belly was so yummy! I also enjoyed that yuzu yellowtail too. I'll def come back to get my sushi fix!",

    "text": "My husband and I stumbled upon Sushi Neko on accident. We were across the street and saw a sign for this place saying they had moved. It also said the sushi to rice ratio was ON POINT! So we decided to check it out. Plus, its off the street so it isn't as busy or overpriced.   Three words that describe the experience: Decadent. Fresh. Proportionate.   Ambiance: The decor of the restaurant is really cool. There's a lot of Anime and random Japanese decor that really makes the experience great. There's cat stuff everywhere because Neko means cat in Japanese. The location is easy to get to. It's in the SF Market plaza on Spring Mountain next to Yosi Vape Shop.   Service: The people do not speak english very well here, which is a good and a bad thing. It's good because you know the food is authentic. It's bad because you can't communicate very well with these people. If you try to ask them a question beyond what's on the menu or ordering they will either ignore you or smile and walk away. But, the food is so good I didn't care too much. The Chef even presented a special to us which was his own creation. The rolls and nigiri came out in a timely manner. We did not wait very long for any of our dishes, which is a plus.   Price: Average AYCE price that's standard in the Las Vegas area. For Lunch its 23.95 and for dinner its 25.95.    Food: The quality of the food was excellent. If I could give this place a rating purely based on the food, I would give it five stars. Everything was fresh. The rice to fish ratio was spot on. We left feeling comfortable instead of overly full from rice. There wasn't a fishy taste to any of it. The salmon belly and yellowtail belly was a game changer. I recommend getting the eel, super white tuna, trout, and paprika smoked salmon nigiri. It's the best I've ever had in Las Vegas! There's specials on the wall as well that you can order. It's random every time so take a look at that as well.    Drinks: There's alcohol there, but we didn't have any. From the prices it looks reasonable and it's normal brands like Sapporo, Asahi, and Kirin Ichiban. There's sake as well.   My husband and I would definitely come back again. :-)",

    "text": "After hearing good things about this place I finally managed to find a time to check out Sushi Neko , located where Shuseki used to be in Chinatown.   Walked In with a group of 7 for dinner which is $25 per person. We were immediately greeted and seated as soon as we walk in, after we were seated our waiter then proceeded to give us a overview of the Premium specials that they offered for filling out or checking in(?) on yelp and explained to us how the ordering system worked. We were given 1 Paper menu and on the menu we were supposed to fill in on the side how many orders we wanted next to the name, one huge frustrating problem with this is that everything on the regular menu is NOT on the paper menu so this led to some confusion but we eventually just delt with it by writing everything we wanted that wasn't on the menu, on the back page.  (If they don't tell you the specials, or if you want something specific that's not on the menu be sure to ask them right away as there are many things available that they don't put on either menu)   (Note: I'll mostly be reviewing the things that I tried, as for what my friends ordered I did not try their rolls so i shall not review it)   Appetizers -   KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) - 2 Pieces per order of small chicken with a light amount of sauce topped on it. The KFC is really well made here compared to other places. The chicken was really juicy and it was not over-fried nor was the sauce overwhelming, Most importantly the fried chicken was not soggy at all.   Pork Belly- 4 small pieces of pork belly covered it what seems to be teriyaki sauce(?) Not many complaints here. The Pork belly wasn't too fatty nor was it bland, the sauce that they used gave it a nice touch. 100/10 Best Appetizer here   Salmon Carpaccio - (Premium/Compliments from the Chef) Really great and flavorful, can't really go wrong with this selection. Amount of sauce used for the slice that they give you is perfect.   Bulgogi - 0 Pieces, idk never came out 0/10.    All in all their selection of appetizers on the regular and premium menu are worth checking out! They're really good if you... you know... get them...   Salmon, Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Cajun Tuna Nigiri - Salmon was just OK, nothing really great about it .In all the sushi places that I've been to I have never been disappointed in any variation of Tuna be it Garlic/Cajun/Regular, but Sushi Neko managed to do the impossible. . The regular tuna was just bland, soggy, it was pretty hard to finish. Cajun and Garlic Tuna (or should I say Cajun Tuna and Garlic Ponzu Tuna) were equally as bad, not only was the fish really chewy but it was DRENCHED in sauce which made it even more unenjoyable.   Salmon Belly - (Limited to 2 orders per person) This is pretty much the best thing at Sushi Neko IF they have it. Very fatty, juicy, and flavorful just how Salmon Belly should be, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Fish to Rice ratio here is very good.  Other than the food being mediocre, the service was some of the worst I have experienced as well. One of the guys that started serving us was great(Carlos) , knew everything on the menu, was very friendly and helpful. Halfway into our dinner he was replaced with a Lady who had a very bad attitude and not helpful in any way, strangely enough it was around that time that our orders stopped showing up fast or stopped showing up at all, In total we were missing about 7 orders. Had Carlos stayed with us I'd give Sushi Neko 4 stars. Very unlikely that I'll be coming back anytime soon, Sushi Neko still is new so I'll give them some time to overcome their growing pains before I try it again.",

Great decorations, good sushi considering that it's only $27 per person and you get 80 minutes to eat.   The service is slow--so slow it dampened my hunger :/ But since the place was empty they let us stay past 80 min. Love the generous fish to rice ratio! Highly recommend the salmon belly, no. 1 chef makes, best of the best, sashimi roll and double dragon.  Important note: you can get sushi by the roll here but don't do that! They'll just serve you the same rolls as what is served to AYCE crowd. I made that mistake and had to convert to AYCE after the first roll came out--too small!   Note, I can eat raw fish and am not one to hate on sushi/sashimi for being Americanized and having lots of sauce--I like sauce. My one complaint is that some fish pieces came out icy like they hadn't been thawed all the way through. I would just dock a half star but Yelp won't let me do that.",

Alright  No 1 chef makes roll. Just okay.  Popcorn lobster. Just okay as well.   Yes. You do get good fish to rice ratio for the nigiri. But the best nigiri was the Ocean Trout!

    "text": "I really like Sushi Neko, since it's usually not crowded. I've probably been a dozen times, but last two have been not great.   First was on a Friday evening around 7pm.  Party of 3 we walk in door and about a quarter of the tables are empty.  Hostess says they don't have enough waitstaff so need to wait about 30 minutes.  We leave and go upstairs to Veggie House.  Next time, went back for lunch on a Thursday and they were out of Salmon and Tuna.   There seems to be some management/organizational issues.  Price is right and folks that are there are friendly.  Hope they work through whatever issues they are having..",

Large portions of fish to rice ratio. The fish just melted in our mouths. We ordered just about everything on the sushi menu. 2 orders of each.  We only ordered 2 rolls, one of them being the lobster popcorn roll. YUMMY!!! After we ate I realized I hadnt taken a single pic. Sorry .  It was so good! The service was really great too. A lot of places make you feel rushed. You feel like you have to order everything right away because they won't be back.  Not this place. They came over a lot, asking if we wanted to order, refilling our drinks, and clearing our dishes. Can not wait to go back!!!!",

The delicious selection of rolls for all you can eat made up for any possible hiccup. Really good experience, will come back for sure",

There is so much competition out there, but Neko has made it way to the top in my book.  Our waiter was very nice and knowledgable. All of their sushi were made fresh, and every single order we liked. There wasn't that many people there so we were seated right away.   Only thing that I didn't like was that they charge per can when it comes to soda, and I love a nice cold Coke when I go eat sushi. Everything else was so amazing that they made up for that.   Overall, I recommend this place. It's a good place to eat sushi with friends, and they have just as good of an atmosphere and customer service. I've been to many sushi areas around the area of LV, but I definitely see myself coming back to eat Neko.",

Large selection of appetizers, including some of the same ones you'll see at kbbq places up the street. Dinner is $26 and includes uni (but not for lunch). Great atmosphere! Reminds me of being in Japan, with beautiful murals on the walls and good lighting. Very conducive to having a nice conversation with a friend or with family.",

We've been three times now and I feel confident in leaving this post that without a doubt it's 5 stars.   Love the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri. So many options and they're all really tasty. Quality is great. Love the creativeness of some of the rolls or even some of the simplicity of them. It's all about what you are in the mood for. Sauce? No sauce? Fresh? Fried? No rice? They really do have something for everyone. Screaming O roll is one of my favorites. No rice. I also enjoy, crunch roll, spicy tuna, rock and roll, tiger roll and sashimi roll.   Wait time to get in can sometimes be long but I feel it's worth it. Longest I've waited was 70 minutes. Least was 5 minutes. As soon as you order your foods to your table ASAP. The bus boy is quick at taking plates off your table which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. I hate staking plates on my table and it looking messy.  Not a huge fan of the creamy shrimp but the oysters and mussels make up for that miss. Delicious! I could have mussels all night. I actually ordered them three times.   Pork belly is scrumptious! Straight from my lips to my hips. I have to get a few in every time.   Skip the bacon wrapped scallops, they're too tiny for my liking, but taste good. Trying these won't take away from your appetite.   I only got a few pictures in as I remembered to take pictures half way through our meal.",

I had the AYCE lunch with several appetizers, sushi, and dessert. Everything was as awesome and colorful as my experience!

    "text": "I have been to other all you can eat sushi joints around the Vegas reaction and I think this location has the best quality for your bucks. First off, this review is mainly for those who enjoy the nigiri rather than the sushi rolls.   Other locations give you an equal portion of fish ratio to the rice ratio but this place... man they give you the fish with a dollop of rice. Our party was super excited when we figures this out. One tip though... it seems like there may be only one sushi chef who seems to work on the nigiri portion so I think we over loaded the poor guy.  Another thing we highly recommend was the pang appetizer. It was like a sushi version of a biscotti. Also the hand rolls had tons of raw fish and little rice which we enjoy but others may not.  Dessert was also good but I think the tempura ice cream was excellent!",

Seaweed salad is okay, spicy. Bugogi should be taken off the menu, it is a terrible cut of meat, basically just a small plate of onions, and sesame seeds all over it.  Classic roll spicy tuna roll is okay, but the cut on it was seriously inconsistent. One piece was huge and the next skinny.  Salmon sushi was okay, but the cut was again sloppy.

Our table was sat between two walls covered in art: one with the Japanese legend Okami, in the same art style as the video game, and the other with a Spirited Away mural. They put some effort into this place.  We got the Lisa Lisa, the Bam Bam, the Baked Lobster, and the coffee mochi - but it was hard to choose with such a vast selection. The Lisa Lisa was out of this world. A bit sweet, salty, with some nice tempura crunch. I scooped up the sauce with my finger when we were done. The other two were also good, both having a bit of a kick to them, but subtle enough that a wimp like me could handle it. A coffee mochi to share topped it off.  Honestly, this place just makes me happy. The food is good, the AYCE selection would be good for a hungrier day - but the vibe is good enough by itself to go back again. Definitely recommend.",

If more fish isn't you're thing, this isn't your place! I am only giving four stars because after the two years I have been eating at this place, I had a slight altercation with one of the employees that resulted in inconsistencies. Sakana is their sister store located near UNLV. Same exact menu, so no stress there.  But the nigiri, to me is always fresh. The seared lemon salmon is my gf's favorite, I love their salmon, and of course the oysters, which is one time only & for dinner price, & the best thing on the menu is the ocean trout which is one time only for either lunch or dinner. Salmon belly is delicious as well, but one time only for dinner.   Half rolls are allowed as long as they don't normally contain soy paper. The no name roll has soy (but you can request seaweed), and it's honestly the only roll that i get full sized because wow it's damn good. The wet dream is warm and cream cheesy and melts in your mouth. Which is the only baked roll I get. Burning your ass roll is probably the spiciest on the menu, but only because it contains a green chili on top of the roll.",

The mussels tasted and smelt weird. Which is a bummer because that's one of my favorite things they offer.  We ordered soup and they brought it out with a cheep plastic spoon. Which wasn't a big Deal, but when everybody around us ordered the same thing and got real spoons it makes you think. Same thing happened with the cups. They gave us disposable plastic cups like you have at a party or something. We ordered more miso soup and right away it smelt like chemicals. Like dish washing soap. And there was also soap on my spoon...  Besides all that... their kitchen was filthy. They had food all over the ground and I finally saw someone clean it before we left.  At that point I couldn't trust anything they brought out anymore and we all lost our appetite. I'm so disappointed in Sushi Neko for this. Kind of ruined sushi for me. This is the stuff you see on the news! What the heck. I think you guys are getting bigger than you can handle and need to expand. I don't think all of this would have happened if you had enough employees or a bigger location. Just a thought..  Sadly, I don't think we'll be coming back.",

The tiramisu is too cakey and the mini honey toast is just a toasted Hawaiian roll covered in cinnamon sugar topped with vanilla ice cream.They cut you off after 2 desserts. Before they used to offer unlimited ice cream but apparently they changed it but they didn't change it on the menus. My friends and I paid for AYCE which should include AYCE dessert.   If you want to get AYCE dessert...STAY AWAY! Go to Goyemon instead!",

    "text": "I've found a favorite AYCE sushi place! Praise the lord, hallelujah! Thank you sushi gods for blessing me with a sushi restaurant where I actually feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for! Trust me, when you see the menu.. you'll know what I'm talking about. It's as big as a PLACEMAT, filled with items front to back, corner to corner.  I wouldn't say it's a hidden gem, but it's tucked in the SF Greenland strip mall on Spring Mtn, just past Decatur. You'll see it when you're about the enter the underground parking, it's right in the corner. Interior is like hip/Japanese, more trendy and wooden seating areas. We came in as a large group, and as we were there I noticed that although the dining area wasn't very large, the space was used efficiently and I didn't see people wait very long compared to other joints where you literally have to wait 30 mins to an HOUR to sit and eat.  Here's the breakdown: 1 order (2pcs) Garlic Tuna Nigiri (5/5) - WOW. Just wow. Very delicious, packed with flavor. And that fish-rice ratio though.. how do you say it? Yaaaaaas.  1 order Cajun Albacore Nigiri (5/5)-  *Please refer to Garlic Tuna* And add another \"yaaaaas.\"  1 order (2pcs) Gyoza (5/5) - Crispy on the outside, steaming on the inside. And the sauce was very flavorful where as other places literally give you soy sauce, this one had other flavor/seasonings added.  1 order (3pcs) Fried Calamari (4/5) - Hot and crispy, but nothing out of the ordinary. And it was served with sweet chili sauce, which I wasn't used to. And personal preference, I like the calamari rings compared to sticks.  Golden California Roll (5/5) - Basically a California Roll that's deep fried. My husband really enjoyed it!  Something Wrong Roll (5/5) - OMG. If you must get something, please get this roll. Topped with an assortment of fish and a deep fried something inside, there was a lot of flavor! It was so good.. I didn't want to share.  Chanel Roll (4/5) - Saw this on the \"Chef Recommends\" blackboard and had to give it a try. It was pretty good, I just would have preferred if it wasn't drenched in the white sauce. I feel like it really overpowered everything else.  Affogato Dessert (5/5) - Coffee and vanilla ice cream and they topped it with Frosted Flakes. If you love coffee and ice cream, this dessert is perfect for you. So simple, but yummy!  Coffee Mochi Ice Cream (5/5) - Nothing you cant get at an Asian market, but points because I love coffee and it helped me get the fishy taste out of my mouth.  We also sampled other dishes, but they will not affect the overall review:  Yellowtail Nigiri (0/5) - I did not like this. Plain and simple.  Seared Salmon and Lemon Nigiri (2/5) - If this we're prepared differently or there was like soy sauce or SOMETHING ELSE.. it was literally straight lemon. And I would rather have cooked salmon or raw salmon, not in between.  Pang Appetizer (4/5) - It's bread with something and cheese. It was different, not my favorite. Just not a fan of cheese with sushi! *Personal preference  The Sh!t Appetizer (5/5): I wouldn't say it's the *poop*, it it was pretty darn good. Hot and fresh from the fryer, it's crispy and delicious!  Also, if it's your birthday, as it was for someone in our party, they cut the lights, play a song & pretty much have the whole restaurant sing happy birthday to you! Super awesome! If you hate things like that when you're eating, don't be a grump.  Overall, great place! I can't wait to come back again. Definitely worth the price we paid & cant wait to try the other items that they have.",

I'm not sure when this change occurred, but the cuts of fish are very strange and the rolls are Korean style rolls (large and skinny pieces).  Also, the service changed a bit.  Only the one guy that clears the table is awesome.  So here's what I experienced on February 3rd:  Nigiri is fine but their sarada lobster, which I LOVE is somewhat different and the pieces are small.  Also, the nori was torn and a few pieces arrived not even completely finished.    Rolls are what I know to be Korean style, where they roll is large, as in 2\" or more in diameter, and cut them thin.  I really do not like the size because it's more difficult to eat.  The rice itself is weird now, too.  No flavor.  Service was okay. They did check up on us but we had 3 people taking care of us, so the orders were a bit mixed up.  Overall, it's gone downhill, and AYCE sushi isn't amazing quality, either.  Time to find a new spot.",

Once you walk in, the vibe... the atmosphere.. the service!!!!!! Are you freaken kidding me? Why isn't this place a full 5 star yet? Everything we ate was so good! We got the all you can eat dinner package and literally tried all the things you can only order once. They didn't have Uni though since they said it didn't smell too good so they wouldn't serve it. I love that! Some places will just serve it and you will have a fun time later when you get home lmao. Anyways! MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE WAS THE SUPER WHITE TUNA!!!!! I literally freaken cried when I first ate it. It literally topped it off to such a great meal. If you're on a low carb diet and high protein diet... haha you'll love this place!!! The rice serving is so tiny and the protein is so fresh and it's literally can wrap around the rice. I mean... WOW!!! For the price? Hell yeaaaaah I'll be here all the time now!!! Our servers were so nice and on it. They really came around to cater to you. Taking the plates off the table, refilling your drinks like ninjas and seriously always smiling because we are so happy! Guess what!!! Buy 1 get 1 on beers and some soju!! That's right!!!! I said it hahaha BOGO!!!! You literally have to try this place in order to understand my excitement. I never used so many !!!!!!!!!!! In a post before. The desserts in the end.. please try the affrogato for all you coffee lovers. Mini honey toast with ice cream! Omg you get ice cream with each side lol. Yes I love this place!! Help me get it to 5 stars! Cheeeers my fellow foodies!!!",

Lunch is $20.99 and dinner is $25.99 (dinner includes uni, oyster and more stuff) you just gotta order a nice amount right away though cos if you take time you'll get your first order then you have to wait for your next one. Unless you're chit chatting and not too hungry it's okay. Nonetheless this place is good!",

They also have a  variety of appetizers and sushi choices with the AYCE option. We've been saying it was Vegas' best kept secret for years but recently they've gotten so much busier than before. The wait times are usually pretty quick.  One tip I would say is not going on a Friday or Saturday night, they are super busy and sometimes they mess up orders with tables near each other. They have a huge staff but I think that needs a little work and organization. But it's happened several times. We usually avoid coming those nights.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner after finding out A18 was closed recently. My friend and I really wanted some Korean chicken and beer. XD dang those Korean dramas !   This is what we ended up going to since myself and her didn't feel like going to Yunnan Tasty Garden. I totally didn't feel like eating spicy food that day. Nor that amount of oil included. Or salt.... anyways I digressed.   My friends were seated already when I had arrived and ordered. They had ordered a variety of stuff and I just sat and waited for the food.  Sushi Neko is popular as it is a sister restaurant to Sakana, who also owns Hwaro KBBQ. They are known to have the same style of serving sushi as a lot of restaurants in California. By that, I mean large fish portion to small rice portion ratios. Fish is long enough to wrap about the rice, if not overlap. LOL I do like to have a bit more rice though (than what was served) as too much fish can be a bit.... tiring after a while XD   I think the restaurant had renovated a little bit as it looks a bit different since my last visit. Apparently according to some uh Q&A/Tips on yelp, it was under construction/renovation a month or so ago.   Overall. Service was decent. The fish was pretty good quality this time. Forgot to opt out of all the toppings and sauces they put but it was still decent overall. Salmon belly, limited 1 order per person, was pretty fatty but thin and skinny (in comparison to everything else). Salmon (normal) was plated really nicely on a round plate, making it look like a flower. Some pieces were pretty fatty. some were pretty lean. Super white tuna and yellowtail was pretty decent as well. They had forgotten my salmon skin handroll and ikura orders but after a while, I was quite full to care anyway. Lol.   My fear of returning to this place was that the fish would be frozen like my previous visit a year ago. But luckily, it was much better this time around.   Lots of random Korean Pop music videos playing but it was great when Taeyeon came up at the end of the meal. What a finish... XD ! haha ahah..ha..?",

My sister and I came last before 7pm didnt leave until almost 9. When we first got there there were maybe 5 other tables and 3 servers. I'm thinking one of the servers shift ended and its down to 2 servers and within 10 minutes a lot of people come in to eat. At first all the nigiri comes very fast, but we waited super long for our rolls. They forget some of our apps and 2 of the rolls we ordered. At this point were too full and annoyed to care.  Our server never came back to check on us and I had to tell the busser. Ask for the check and dessert and they only bring my dessert and forget my sisters. Idk if I should feel bad that they were understaffed and my server had almost 10 tables, but they should at least have the bussers start taking orders.  I felt sorry for the table next to us. They were done with all their food by time we entered and they waited 20 minutes for their check and dessert. Overall, come here for lunch. Dinner price and wait isnt worth it. Everything was good, except salmon nigiri which tasted flavorless.",

Our server took our order (got everything wrong, fried rolls took an hour and a half to come out I wish I was kidding) my friends next to me never received 2 of their rolls. We were pressured to leave at 11:50 when my fiance had barely received his food 10 minutes prior when we were sat at 10:00. Our first server left abruptly our 2nd never went to the whole table she was very rude last call came at 11:20 when it is at 11:30 yet how was I supposed to order if she never came to my end of the table? The only reason we didn't walk out was because Sushi Kaya had a 2 hour wait and we were starving. Icing on the cake they overcharged me when everything was ate. Did I mention they added items to the check that no one ordered they took about 5 items off reluctantly. I paid my tab even if my fried rolls tasted as if they were sitting out for awhile when our 2nd server swore up and down the 5 times I asked about them that they take longer (shouldn't  be 90 min longer) honestly I wish I would have waited the 2 hours for sushi Kaya . Never coming back and I advise you to never come here do yourself a favor and go to Kaya or Yama .",

    "text": "It irritates me how much of a 180 Sushi Neko had on my second visit.   My first visit was an acceptable experience, the food was unique enough to set itself apart from the saturation of AYCE sushi places we have in Las Vegas plus there was no wait time. There is an array of hot items and menu variety to satisfy my parents who are not by any means hardcore sushi connoisseurs. Almost all nigiri had some type of sauce or dressing as did most of the their other dishes, not my preferred choice, but acceptable. The service was really lacking, as the servers were a bit quiet, but efficient enough.   This second visit, holey moley, am I even in the same restaurant? Sushi Neko hit 3 strikes really quick and made it a point that I may get food poisoning. Fish is delicate and requires more than a sharp knife to handle, we all know that and we also know that fish isn't supposed to be chewy. With the uncertain origins of super white tuna of whether its authentic or even just escolar, its scary to take a bite and the fish is chewy. It scares me that it had the same consistency of squid or octopus. Consistently having scales on multiple different fishes, or orders that are so drenched in sauce that both the rice and fish fall apart. Second, a lot of things ordered, did not show up, or were confused ie seaweed salad and seafood salad. If you don't have something, let the customer know, rather than have them just sit and wait for it. Third, the service was pretty bad, its not hard to satisfy me, tell me what you're bringing, and refill water. The restaurant wasn't pack or serving any big parties so I can't imagine its hard for 2 servers and 1 busser to let me know what you're serving me.  I know Sushi Neko is part of the same group that owns Sakana, with 99% of the same menu, so how can an apple fall from the tree so far? I would be embarrassed if any of my friends came here through my recommendation and experienced what I did, so for the foreseeable year I'll stay away.",

My favorites rolls are the no rice rolls which are only available for dinner, unfortunately, so we did not get to order those. The fish is fresh here. I'm a regular at Sakana on maryland, but since sushi neko is closer, i sometimes go here. The menu is the same at both locations. I just like how it is a lot less busier at sushi neko. I never had to wait for a table and never waited more than 5 minutes for my order to come. The service is great and the food is awesome. I definitely recommend this place :)",

    "text": "This place came so hyped up by two of my friends so I was ready to be blown away- however I wasn't. Definitely my fault for coming here already practically full, and still deciding to eat AYCE. The garlic tuna is solid, but all of the rolls that my girlfriends ordered were way too sweet and covered in some kind of sauce or red and green looking tempura. Kind of strange. Another fault of mine is letting my friends order all of the rolls, when I know what I like. The Chanel roll picked by me, was the best my far.   The desserts unfortunately are only one per order and that counts for ALL of them not just the mochi which is really disappointing and kind of unusual.  Definitely willing to come back again and give them another chance when I'm in the mood for all you can eat and actually hungry.",

We normally order the nigiri and the rice to fish ratio is great. You get more fish and it isn't stuffed with rice like most other places. They don't do reservations so make sure to come early and sign in. The wait isn't too bad but expect to wait on the weekend nights. The Oyster is great but it is spicy( you can ask to make it not spicy). Some of my personal favorites are the Chanel roll, lemon salmon roll, super white, and the Dragon roll. The service is fast and nice. The restrooms are always clean. Best all you can eat sushi",

Had a great assortment of Sushi, tempura shrimp & Veggies & then it was over for me because I got a fried sweet shrimp leg caught in my throat. I drank water ate some sushi but it never dislodged from my throat. I was even thinking of going to the ER it was that bad. Went home & drank some soda thinking it would melt it or some crazy thing like that. As I type it's still stuck in my throat. Hopefully it will unstuck itself. I'll eat sweet shrimp but never again will I eat the fried head. All in all it was a very good meal. We will come again for sure.",

Walking in.. you cant help but just look around and seeing all their interesting decorations and beautiful artwork throughout the whole restaurant.  The music playing was a little to loud for me but it was bearable... (Top40s, EDM)  We came in during lunchtime on a weekday.. it was not packed at all. Got seated and they do have a high chair for the little one - yay!  AYCE lunch is $20.95 and dinner is at $25.95 (not bad)  Started ordering and within a few minutes our orders started coming out. Fish to rice ratio is awesome.. if you like more fish to rice that is... (not so awesome if you like rice more than fish though). Fish tasted fresh.. rice is done perfectly.. water was cold.. and service was great!  -quick note- we tried going on a weekend during lunch time and this place was packed! i cant imagine how long they can get backed up during dinner times..   Plenty of parking and they also got a covered garage parking..   Can't wait to go back!  ENJOY!",

Which I loved so much to be honest. Moreover they have a lunch menu which you pay 20$ to get how much sushi you want which is incredible that's what my friends and I got it's a great deal. It was my first time trying different kind of sushi and I wasn't disappointed at all mostly everything my friends made me try was good especially \"The Shit\" that's how it's called lol. It was fried and had shrimp inside which I love. There was a dip on the side of the dish I think is was spicy mayonnaise and it gave it a delicious flavor with \"The Shit\". Totally recommend getting that sushi. Furthermore the sushi's that sounded good to me were the ones I got which were Superman and Mexican Roll. The Superman has shrimp, rice, and mayo on top with some spicy powder it was tasty. The Mexican Roll has shrimp, rice, and something sweet crunchy on top which was delicious. Additionally I recommend coming to this sushi place it was great y'all won't regret it.",

I don't think I'll be going back to any other sushi restaurant for quite some time because the offerings here are just far too good to want to pass up.  Their Nigiri is BY FAR the largest pieces of fish I have been served. Their special dishes are absolutely INCREDIBLE. Their flavors are spot on, freshness and quality are stellar, and the restaurant is well kept.  If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out and doing a disservice to your Sushi craving taste buds.",

What happened to serving the customers and not being in it for the money? I guess it doesn't happen in this sushi restaurant  P.S. The service is great, but I wish the owner was as nice as the employees were.",

The super white, smoked paprika salmon, seared lemon salmon, salmon belly, hamachi, and garlic tuna are all delicious. The sides are worth ordering as well; the shit, pa dak, shrimp tempura, crispy rice, stuffed tomato, etc. the atmosphere is very upbeat and loud, but in a good way. The tv stations play K-pop videos and the decor is very eclectic, complete with a wooden tree structure coming out of one wall. There's always ample parking in the garage adjacent to the restaurant. I've been here when it's busy and when it's slow and the service is consistently top notch. This is where I take out of town guests that want great sushi and plenty of it.",

Why did I wait so long? How did I live without Sushi Neko? Yes, it's that amazing! It has changed my life forever lol  Everything about this place was amazing. Service, food, ambience.....EVERYTHING! I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. It was PERFECT!  We tried a good amount of the menu. Got half rolls of all rolls we tried to ensure we had room for more.   Appetizers:  you MUST have the seafood salad and the PANG! OMG  The seafood salad and is a one-time order but honestly it was a big portion. There was 4 of us who decided to share it and we couldn't even finish it. The pang is a baked yummy goodness of seafood on top of a crispy toasted toast. It was so good we ordered a second round! I also got the pork belly, the tofu, \"the shit\", baked mussels and I know more but honestly can't remember. Just try them all....you won't be disappointed, I promise!  Sushi: must have any and all nigiri's  the rice to fish ratio is crazy! Fish is fresh and delicious with a small amount of rice! We ordered quite a few rolls but to name a couple we Ordered the I love my ass and popcorn lobster I don't recall the rest.   Dessert: mini honey toast and Affogato are must haves! Omg, I wish we could order more than one.   This definitely is my new sushi joint. I'm still at awe with the experience I had from start to finish. I don't think I've had an experience like this in a very long time. Usually there is something that goes wrong even if it was minor but not tonight and not at Sushi Neko!",

The ambience is pretty cozy. They play good music.  Price is fair for $25.95 for dinner (AYCE)  Cons:  Wait time is super long. we have to wait 25 min on a Saturday at 330 pm to be seated. The place wasn't busy. there were plenty of sits available. There were only 1 server, 3 bussers. We got our order down as soon as we sat down. Then he didn't come back at all. By this time we were waiting for 30 min. Now 3 more tables are complaining. Ok by this time one of the busser took all the orders of everyone that was waiting. So yea waiting isn't cool.   So be prepared when you're here. If you don't mind waiting feel free to enjoy your time.",

You can only order 1 each of the 3 $1.95 skewers and only ONE, no repeats.  Everything else on the menu you can order again.  Also apparently you can only order certain foods from certain waiters.

For the sushi nigri, they give you a big cut of the fish with very little rice. For AYCE, you have to eat the rice along with the fish, but rice portions are small. :). Green tea ice cream and mocha ice cream was tasty! FAST service as well. The only downside is that they were slow and forgetting (forgot to bring out second order) in being out the cooked dynamite roll. Other than that, I would HIGHLY recommend this place for any Las Vegas tourists for sushi. Would Definitely come back!",

Everything was delicious~ loved the pork belly, pang, KFC, bulgogi nachos, etc. The second time I went was for dinner. We ordered all nigiri and were really impressed with the fish quality and rice to fish ratio  We loved all the dinner-only nigiri, it made dinner more than worth it. Big recommend.",

We were looking for a sushi place around past noon and most good sushi places don't open until dinner. I found this at yelp. While there are not much reviews yet, most of the reviews are pretty good. When we arrived, there were only 3 people inside. But we're so glad we found this place and definitely going back. We tried some of theirs appetizers and they are OK. We ordered mostly nigiri and a roll. The nigiri are amazingly fresh, big slices and underneath small mound of rice. The roll we got was full of crab inside. I only took one picture one of the nigiri but good enough to show you how they look like. We can't wait to go back to this place soon!",

After we ordered our first round of sushi, we literally were sitting at our table for 40 minutes straight without any of our rolls being delivered.  We finally got our appetizers after that 40 minute period but probably waited another 10 extra minutes to get our rolls.

AYCE sushi at $25, which is normal for AYCE sushi except EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. My brother and I were thoroughly impressed with the freshness of the fish, and especially, the rice-to-fish ratio. We were able to enjoy several options.  Normally, I hate fried or baked rolls, but I enjoyed every single one. My mom, who hates eating raw anything, enjoyed all the raw or at least, seared fish items.  Order anything with yuzu or friend onions seriously.   I would honestly say that it reminded me of Bay Area Amami San quality at an AYCE sushi spot, which the exception of the Ebi Shrimp (which was still delicious!). Forget Kenzo's or Fuji's or places like that. This was DELICIOUS.",

In Vegas, we've been to Goyemon, Sushi Mon, Sushi Kaya, Jjanga Sushi, Sushi Koma, Hikari Sushi, and nearly EVERYWHERE ELSE in Vegas, especially the ones that are all you can eat. And let me tell you, this place ranks above and beyond ANY of them!   We ordered... so much... because it was all SO GOOD!!! From the Appetizers to the Sushi(Nigiri), every single item we ordered tasted like heaven on Earth. The fish to rice ratio was A+. Twice the fish with half the rice. Presentation was flawless, A+. Different plates for different orders of sushi adds an elegant flare.   We are definitely new regulars to Sushi Neko. I can't wait to go back! For 25.95 dinner price, only one place compares to this AYCE sushi place... and it's in SoCal.   I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND EVERY ONE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT. A+. 5 stars.",

(because there are so many to choose from!!!) what he gave us were definitely awesome!!! I will post one of them here. Everything was soooooo great and I will definitely come back again.  If you are looking for new AYCE sushi restaurant, I highly recommend this place!!!!\r\rI don't normally make yelp reviews, but this restaurant definitely deserved it! 5 stars.\r\rPs.

I probably should not be sharing this with you because I don't want it to get too popular, but that is selfish. The fish is excellent and fresh, but I don't like the limits of salmon belly, it's kind of odd because not every one likes it. I like that a lot of the baked dishes are small and you can order a large variety of them. If you are not really into raw fish then there might be some better places. I was very satisfied with the meal and it didn't leave me too full as many other places would have. We finished with the ice cream and coffee dessert and we were pleasantly surprised that the coffee was strong enough to leave a good taste, we were expecting disappointment and we were, instead pleasantly surprised around every corner.",

We tried the green tea panna cotta and tempura ice cream. Both very tasty. I'll be trying the Mini Honey Toast on my next visit. Service was pretty quick! Granted we were one of the only 4 tables occupied but my food came out within 5 mins every time I ordered. The servers were very attentive.

Very sneaky of them which is not necessarily a bad thing though they could have just gone with one name unless of course one is ripping off the recipe from the other, lol. Their nigiri is probably the best in terms of fish to rice ratio with good dessert choices. One thing that bothers me is that I'm use to writing my orders on a sushi  checklist rather than having multiple waitresses take the order which can be confusing.  Other than that, it's a typical AYCE sushi experience which I've had better since moving here from the OC.",

I am usually hard on my reviews soo here we go.... Been to over 20 different places and this by far is the best bang for the buck. Service is great. Not snobs. Fish to rice ratio is great. No \"slimy\" after taste.  Place extremely clean. Hell..the ice tea was even tastey. No complaints here. Great job guys. Great job. Don't listen to the one below (K). Read past reviews and you'll see only looking for that free meal.",

I wanted to have an amazing last supper before my surgery Friday and knew sushi was what I wanted. I came across another sushi spot but read reviews and somehow someone mentioned Sushi Neko in their review. My husband and I ended up at Sushi Neko Thursday night and it was amazing! I normally don't go out of my way to tip way beyond the normal recommended tips to the waiter and chefs or write a review but Sushi Neko deserves it! This is my new and only sushi spot I will go to now. The ambiance, staff, and food was amazing! The price isn't ridiculous. From the moment you walk in the art and not your typical sushi spot decor is extraordinary! The sushi was fresh and presented with such art. You can taste how fresh the vegetables and sushi were. I never had a sushi roll with such a crisp yummy cucumber in between. I'm sorry for the long review and I'm sure I can go on but you get the picture...Sushi Neko is by far amazing!",

Our server was really nice and attentive.   We had an all-you-can-eat sushi lunch and the price was decent for all the dishes you could order.  The fish pieces on the nigiri were huge and fresh.  All the rolls we had were really good, and so were the special appetizers that were recommended.  I love that you can get half-rolls so you can try more.  The salmon kama was super good.  We definitely recommend you try it!  We will definitely be back the next time we're in the area.  The only downside to this place (and it's so minor) would be a song or 2 that was kind of inappropriate with the language.",

Unfortunately they must have either been understaffed or they didn't expect to be busy on a Tuesday night so  the wait staff was extremely busy and food was extremely slow coming out. In an hour and 15 minutes of being there we had only eaten 2 sushi rolls and several appetizers. Having to make a reservation at the laundry room in downtown Vegas, I politely asked if we could just pay for our sushi rolls and apps instead of paying the AYCE price of $25 per person. The wait staff was extremely accommodating, apologized, and even waved the apps. So not the best night but the service definitely made up for it. I tipped well and will come back soon.",

Our wait was only about 2-30 mins for 3 people on a Friday night, which I thought wasn't too bad. It's located in the corner of a small strip mall with close parking.  The inside decor is super fun and they play upbeat club type music which gives off a high energy vibe. They have about 2 servers that only take orders while the rest run out the completed orders once ready. The concept works too because our food came out so quickly! Some of my favorites from the night were the Cajun Tuna, Towering Sashimi, Bam Bam Roll and the Honey Toast. I really can't complain about any of the items we had though, they were all great.  I will most certainly be back again and again. Thanks for a great experience!",

    "text": "I went here for lunch after getting turned down from Sakana because they didn't let me upgrade to their dinner option for lunch. Sushi Neko is the same AYCE concept and has the same exact menu as Sakana since they are brother/sister restaurants. The only difference is that Sushi Neko offers their dinner option all day which I highly recommend because you'll be paying a difference of $5 more for more expensive choices of nigiri and rolls without rice. Some items was a miss but it's a good AYCE option if you like endless amounts of sushi.   Pros  Service: You order from their menu and everything is made as you order so it's a fresher option than getting your food under heat lamps. The service was fast and friendly and not once did we felt rushed.   Nigiri: For the most part, all the sashimi were good and there was very little rice per order. Some items were a total miss but that's mainly items that needed to be cooked.   Dinner: If you're here during lunch hours, the dinner option is worth upgrading to since they have a section of \"no rice\" rolls which I enjoyed for AYCE. One of the options was a poke salad which had little amounts of salad but plenty pieces of assorted cube sashimi. The dinner options also gives you 2 pieces of uni nigiri, ocean trout nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, and oysters per person.   Options: It's not limited to just nigiri or sushi rolls, there are a lot of cooked items in their appetizers section and they even offer hot skewers with shrimp or scallops wrapped in bacon.   Seating: It turned out to be a good thing going here instead of Sakana. While the menu and the pricing are the same, the seating here is a lot more spacious which is great for big groups and a lot cleaner. As a crazy cat lady, I enjoyed the cat themed aesthetics which made it more kid friendly.",

The rolls were nice and tight not falling apart and the amount of rice was just right not too much like other places. They don't have many no rice rolls but they do have a lot of fresh rolls and deep fried ones. I'm not a fan of tempura so I never get them anywhere I go. But the fresh rolls were so delicious, I wanted to keep eating more but didn't have the space to fit it in.  The service here is really great as well, they come asking for refills where your about half way into you cup which mean they really to pay attention to you. Desert is also great a must try is the Korean coffee, it was amazing.",

    "text": "Sushi Neko is a sister restaurant to Sakana. There's a lot to love, but I still prefer the original location.  Neko is located off of Decatur and Spring Mountain and is fairly new. The majority of the restaurant is super cute and fun, although the bathrooms leave a lot to be desired. Nothing terrible just kind of an eye sore.   The staff is noticeably young IMO but they are very efficient. I never feel like I have to track them down and they usually don't miss any items I've ordered.  Neko is all about the nigiri in my opinion. They serve large slices of protein for their nigiri. I feel like none of their rolls really stand out. I come here when I'm craving some appetizers and some nigiri.  If you ever catch them at dinner time try their tako wasabi! It is so good! It's octopus marinated in wasabi. A couple of my favorites are ocean trout and the amori scallop nigiri as well.  I can't say much more about Neko. It's a very solid AYCE in Vegas's crowded market. My one huge complaint is that it's always warm in here when I go. It's just not the best feeling when you have to rush to eat your raw fish.   Definitely check this place out and with any other AYCE spot just try things until you find what you like.  Their dinner price is totally worth it to get uni, sweet shrimp, and oysters!",

First the fish to rice ratio is amazing. You will get the bang for the buck you pay here.  Second the quality of the fish is top notch. You can easily taste the freshness of the fish. Third the flavor is amazing, they even marinate their own mackerel which is pretty impressive. Some people think the mackerel decides the quality of a sushi restaurant and their mackerel is one of the best. Fourth the choices of sushi and fish were plentiful. They also have appetizers, skewer items and desserts.  Overall this place is amazing and it can easily be my top 3 sushi place.",

It tasted fresh and prepared just the way I like it, with a small amount of sushi rice in relation to the fish not like some places where there's more rice than fish. The fish tasted fresh and they had most of the stuff I liked. I will give it five stars today because it deserves it. I will come back and see if it changes...",

They really put their creativity & love of sushi into their menu. Great fish to rice ratio & melts in your mouth! The food, atmosphere & staff were all amazing & equally contributed to my 5 star experience. The best part? It's a casual setting & an affordable price. AYCE Lunch cost $20.95",

The baked mussels were unlimited and fabulously made, just the way I like them with the right amount of mayo and not overcooked. There was a nice selection of daily specials as well.

    "text": "We come here a lot... this is our go to for sushi. Mainly because they have an AYCE option and I personally like the quality of their fish. If you do a la carte, your check will easily add up (recommend AYCE). We first went to Sakanashi Sushi on Maryland pkwy (same owner). But this restaurant opened up and it's closer to our house. We like to order their nigiri, mostly. But I recommend the Chanel roll (tempura roll). The sauce on the Chanel roll is a little spicy, but it tastes really good. If you don't feel like eating a whole roll, you can order a half roll. I'm glad this place doesn't limit you on the ikura. I can order that for days. I've been to other restaurants where their ikura has a chemical taste... but I like the one at Neko. Dinner AYCE is $25.95 and Lunch AYCE is $20.95. Most of their appetizers are included with the AYCE. There are some items on the menu where it's one order per guest (example: salmon belly and uni). I like coming during dinner because dessert is included. You can have as much ice cream as you want, but the specialty desserts are one item per person. I usually order either mochi ice cream, affogato, or mini honey toast.  Usually their staff is really quick with bringing out orders and cleaning plates, which is great. But today when we ordered the salmon Kama.. it wasn't really Kama. When we ordered 4 orders of ikura, only 2 orders came out. But since it's AYCE, we can always order more. So we ordered 3 more, and again only 2 came out. Then when we ordered dessert, my husband ordered mango mochi ice cream and I ordered a strawberry mochi.. we ended up with two mango mochi.  In the end, I do like this restaurant and I will go back.",

Their fish and sashimi can be more fresh. Was a little disappointed because we were really wanting to try some great sushi and sashimi.  They do use a lot of sauce to hide the freshness of the fish. We ordered a roll and couldn't really eat it, even friends who are not so picky.  It was trenched with a lot of mayo and sauce.  The sauce was so thick that it was really hard for us to inhale that piece of roll down. We see a lot of young folks there, so the crowd maybe catered to the younger ones.  For us, we will like to enjoy  nice decent fresh food without using too much ingredients but just the simple ingredients to taste the fish.",

The uni surprised me as well and was probably the best uni I've had here in Vegas (for all you can eat). Everything else was good, above average.

Love the fact that the rice to fish ratio is proper enough to not get filled up with only rice (as most sushi buffets are)  The fish was pretty fresh for buffet standards and the service was excellent! They cleared plates and brought what we ordered almost instantly.   Be sure to ask them what daily specials are available as they are not on the normal menu. Portions are quite abundant for some of the special dishes so maybe order one and share and if you like it order again.  Will definitely be back here again soon! :)",

Knowing that the unlimited sushi in Chicagos pretty bad, I was really excited to come here after seeing the reviews and photos.   First things first, the fish to rice ratio is amazing. A struggle everyone face at AYCE is that they usually put in a lot of rice to get you full faster. Sushi Neko does a really good job at putting a little bit of rice so you can definitely taste the different type of fish.   If youre planning to visit, recommend arriving around 30 minutes before since theres a wait!   The only reason why I'm giving it a four star is because the fish wasn't as fresh as I expected but thats okay because its AYCE. Haha.",

At the end, my sister wanted to order desert, but our waiter didn't stop by our table for over twenty minutes, and after we asked someone else, he only stopped by long enough to drop off the check. My sister still tried to order, but he didn't check in after that, so we left.  The second time, my party and I had to constantly ask where our ordered items were. Thankfully, the staff was much better this time, but I'd guess that at least 1/4 orders took so long we had to reorder them.  This being said, their food is amazing. I love everything on their menu, and the AYCE is definitely worth it. I never struggle to finish anything!",

Their pricing for AYCE is fair and pretty similar to a majority of the AYCE sushi places here in Vegas. Their rolls were delicious, and their nigiri had a good fish-to-rice ratio.   My main issue was with their customer service. Their staff is very friendly, but I had to ask multiple times just to get my water refilled even once. I didn't receive 2 of my orders, even after I asked my waitress about them.   Also, their mini honey toast dessert was very displeasing. I was expecting honey toast, and I was served a Hawaiian roll that was drenched in honey and topped with some ice cream.   All in all, I would definitely come back for the sushi.",

    "text": "Just like its sister restaurant, Sakana... I don't really get this place. Here they do some things really well. But other times it's like WTF... I'll go further into detail (BTW this review can be copied-and-pasted to Sakana as well).  Came here one day after hearing all the hot buzz going on with this spot. Like I mentioned before, Neko is the follow up restaurant to the uber-popular sushi restaurant Sakana on the East side of town. Neko is centrally located in Chinatown on Spring Mountain Rd in a strip mall with other popular eateries nearby. The interior is nicely appointed, and has a very chill vibe. I sat at the sushi bar this time, and was able to watch the sushi chef at work. He was a cool dude and friendly.   Ordered some food and it arrived in an appropriate amount of time. I can't remember exactly which was really good, or which one was so-so because it was months ago, but I'll give you a general idea on why this is a 3-star review, and it is based on the food. About 33% of the sushi was really good. The other 33% was just OK. And as for the final 33%, the fish should have been thrown out the previous day. Inconsistency would be the best word to describe Neko. Sakana and Neko are known for having large, long cuts of fish relative to the small amount of rice, which I think is the reason for the majority of the 5 star reviews for both restaurants. My argument is, \"If the fish and rice quality aren't good to begin with, does it matter if the fish cuts are large, and the rice is small?\" I dunno. The first half of my sushi experience, the rice was somewhat on the hard and cold side. The second half (they must have made a new rice) was too warm and soft. Inconsistency.  I doubt I would be coming back here, there is a glutton of AYCE sushi restaurants in the Valley, and I don't want to take a chance on a roller coaster experience. But I'm glad I was able to try it and see for myself what the story is. Morning glory.",

Also, the menu is horrid for the colorblind or those who don't have 20/20 vision.  Neon writing on neon background is not easy on the eyes--but that has nothing to do with the two stars.    Note: I do not use soy sauce or wasabi on rolls--usually the taste will stand up on its own:  Garlic tuna was on par.  Son of a Beach and Coco Shrimp were excellent.   The Be Sexy tonight was OK, so was Be Happy. Burn your ass was so bland even I could eat it, and jalapenos send me into tears. Chanel was like eating a rainbow roll which was like eating a california roll which was less than thrilling. And the Full Moon roll was just downright cardboard.  If you really like putting wasabi or soy sauce on the rolls, then the bland rolls are probably passable, but they do not stand on their own.  Service was good, but there was only one other table in the restaurant.  Decor is awesome--very Banksy-esque.",

    "text": "I have not written any yelp review in a long time but I absolutely cannot stop talking about this restaurant since I came back to New York. Next year I will definitely be back!  Its the first All You Can Eat I have throughly and fully enjoy. Compare with the All You Can Eat japanese restaurants I have ate at in NYC, this is still better by a huge range!   The price for lunch was $20,95 and I think dinner was $25.95? The price compare to NYC price is the same. I only tried it for lunch, didn't get to try it for dinner yet due to other plans but next time I will definitely do it for dinner. The dinner menu and the lunch menu were only a few selections more but those few more makes it worth it because it includes no rice rolls too!   The quality of the nigiri were out of the world amazing! Rice to fish ratio was perfect! The rice was very small and the fish can literally wrap around it. My sister ordered the udon and she can't get enough of it, she ordered 3 bowls! We also tried a few appetizer, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the cucumber crab salad. It was boring but flavor wise it was fine. We didn't really order much rolls since I was in love with the nigiri but it was still pretty good. For the eel cucumber roll they gave us the eel sauce to dip in ourselves instead of pouring onto the roll which was new. The plum ice cream was nothing special, didn't really taste like plum but still good and different. Service was also amazing. Very attentive, we were almost the only one there for lunch, which was shocking to me. This place is amazing! The decor was also very cute. The name neko means cat so everything and everywhere were cats!  I will definitely be back next year!",

Restaurants try to maximum their profit by feeding their customers with cheaper ingredients. However, at Neko's, the quality doesn't change and the menu doesn't get limited. (They do limit the time frame, when you start eating. 3 hours max)  They have a huge selection on their menu, so it is worth paying the $25.95 for the all you can eat. Their sashimi are fresh and flavorful. Their rolls are plentiful and carter to every sushi lover (raw, cooked, Americanize, traditional, etc.)  The restaurant's decor are so cute, too. Customer service was friendly and speedy.   Would totally recommend this place.",

    "text": "My classmates go crazy for this place, and after finally checking it out for myself, I can definitely see why. The fish to rice ratio is INSANE. I've gone to three other AYCE sushi places in the valley, and this place takes the cake.   For starters, my friend and I chose all of the \"one time only\" dishes. The salmon belly was so perfectly fatty. I also really enjoyed the oyster which had a spicy soy sauce (?) spooned over it and was topped with masago and green onion. I would probably not order the sashimi tower again because it was just a mix of fish in a sweet mayo over a fried wonton. It was a little too heavy for me. The salmon nigiri was awesome. I just can't get over how much fish was given for each portion.   For desserts, we just got a coffee mochi and affogato. The mochi was just one of those premade ones that you can get in a pack of 6. Affogato was topped with cornflakes and almonds (I want to say it was honey bunches of oats, but I'm not sure). They were nothing to write home about, but they were good palate cleansers.  Taste wise, everything was fresh. Portions were great. I actually didn't get to try many rolls because I wanted to get my money's worth in fish LOL but I can definitely see myself coming back.",

Once we sat down, we ordered right away because we were hungry and they looked pretty busy.   We ordered a beer which came out at room temperature and when we tried to return it, we got another one at room temperature again. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out and we were constantly receiving items we didn't order. The servers were all over the place and seemed so unorganized like they didn't know the table numbers. We had to keep asking them to check on our food & lastly, they ran out of items that we had ordered but didn't even bother telling us until we asked where our food was.  The food is good. The fish to rice ratio was perfect. The portions are small but I guess it helps save room for more food. The time that we waited to receive our food just seemed ridiculous to the point where we didn't even wanna order any more and wait 30 minutes every time. Hire more workers! This place could easily be 5 stars.",

There is great staff here, great quality of fish, and a great ambiance. The staff is always quick and attentive to my needs for such a busy restaurant. The fish to rice ratio is just what I'm looking for. If you're a person like me who likes more fish than rice on their nigiri, this is the place to go.   Their menu offers a great variety of choices from appetizers, from specialty rolls, to desserts and the alcohol. They have highlighted items in red on their menu for \"must try's\" and my personal favorite is the appetizer called \"The Shit\".   The Shit - a (2 pcs) order of spicy siracha imitation crab meat wrapped around seaweed and fried in tempura batter.   Pang - a (2 pcs) order of salmon and imitation crab covered in cream cheese and sweet soy glaze on top of briochette bread.   KFC - Korean fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce   Pa Duk - Korean honey mustard fired chicken  Birthday Mini Cake - dessert specialty for birthday person only   If you are coming to eat with a big party or for a celebration, they do have a great deal on their sake! It is only $1 from 10pm-closing.   You must try and please tell me about your experience!",

We ordered and had our sushi in minutes. Very fast!  The specialty rolls were good, we tried crunchy roll, Captain America Roll, Be Happy Roll and others. Nothing bad, but we didn't find one that shone through.   The real winners though, was the Nigiri we ordered. Very little rice and large pieces of fish. Each with its own flavor profile.   The iced green tea was also a winner. Our server was great, but I forgot her name. Kirin maybe?",

The cost is the same compared to all the places in Reno, but you get so much more here in way of choices and the amount of fish on the nigiri pieces. Reno, has big rice balls and  thin see thru almost slices of fish. This place has little rice balls and big, I mean giant slices of fish and great quality as well.  We got totally stuffed and did have one roll at all! The selection of appetizers was amazing and we had many things I never had before. Just look at the menu and see all the things! I've never had nigiri fish slices this big before ... I like it! The tempura shrimp and calamari were hot and crisp without being oily.   There is no sushi bar seating here, it's all tables and booths. We arrived around 2pm and found a nice booth. I can see this place filling up fast. The parking is tight, but try the underground garage and stay out of the heat on hot days, or better is the second floor parking accessed from the side street. Service here was super on point and each server puts in your order via a tablet linked to the kitchen, so it's real efficient in their operation. The sushi came out fast and well made.  All the sushi we had was great except for the salmon eggs, Ikura. They were a little on the dried (aged) side. I guess not too many people order that, so it can get old. We had so many things, I can remember them all, but we did try almost all the fish offered.  I'll come back here again for sure. I gotta get our local places up north to cut fish like this!",

The servers, food runners and sushi chefs are always very sweet and attentive. Now about their sushi.. the rice to fish ratio when you order nigiri is GREAT! The rice ball is small so you don't get filled up on rice and the fish size is huge!! Like 3 times the length of the rice! And the fish quality is just fantastic. So buttery and melt in your mouth, fresh, goodness. I always order the salmon belly, salmon and yellow tail ponzu. They have great roll options as well and you can do half orders. Sakana sushi was my favorite all you can eat destination but it's too far from where I live. I was not surprised to find out Neko is their sister property because their sushi is just the same. They have yummy dessert options as well. My only complaint is they don't have coffee. At one point they carried a BTS cold brew that was SO GOOD but they have not carried it since in all the times Iv been back. Iv had to order their affogato dessert and slurp the coffee that's in it",

    "text": "You know the joke about sex and pizza? That even when it's bad it's still pretty good? I guess I'm that way with my sushi. This place came recommended to me as Sakana's sister restaurant and 3 stars was a gift...here's what went wrong:  1. I like sitting at the bar. The bar here is dark and you are looking straight ahead at the kitchen with hobart equipment staring you in the face, so the atmosphere is severely lacking.  2. The tray that you mix your soy sauce and wasabi isn't too deep a dish so it creates a problem.  3. There were no specials, like zero. I was told to come back on the weekend where there is more of a crowd and they have specials written on the board.  4. I love tobiko nigiri. The tobiko was very thin on top, like a thin layer of tobiko icing, half the amounts I'm used to elsewhere (maybe the pics don't show it, but it was thin).  5. There was a 6 inch black hair on my salmon nigiri and it ended up in my mouth...completely grossed me out...it was one of those hairs that was hard to grab from my tongue...and when I took it out I could immediately see who's hair it belonged to from the kitchen who must have done prep that day. I didn't want to be one of those yelpers that would take a picture and put it on the internet and remove business from potential customers who would see that on yelp and run for the hills. Shit happens. I guess I was in a good mood.  6. I ordered the honey toast and it didn't come for 15 minutes...and when it finally did come it was made with a completely stale toasted piece of bread, the bread just crumbled it was so old...and I had this dessert a dozen times at Sakana so I know how it's supposed to be...just totally capped off a disappointing experience.   SO WHAT WENT RIGHT?  1. I like the Sakana/Neko menu. The rolls are excellent and the nigiri is always fresh and has a nice fish/rice ratio (minus the tobiko situation). +1 for the all the no rice options...I run down the no rice list offered at dinner time and get them all.  2. Salmon belly with fresh wasabi is a winner.  3. Although the mishap over the 15 minute wait on the stale honey toast was a miss, the service with drinks never emptied and friendliness of the wait staff was on point.  OVERALL  If given the choice, I think it's worth the extra drive and even a short wait to go to Sakana until this place pulls it together.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service. The only reason I'm giving it a star is because it was decent rolls.  I was hoping this would be great, I tried to stay positive during the entire experience but my cousin found a long a** hair in one roll!   We were nice about it and they didn't care. A server kept bringing us orders that weren't ours.  They would deny that we ordered certain rolls and continually bringing us the same roll we didn't order.  The lady serving us the rolls didn't even know the name of them and would just drop off plates without saying anything. Even if we would tell them it's not our roll!   I am a sushi lover and go to many sushi restaurants and this is one of the most unwelcoming, with worst customer service at an All you can Eat Restaurant.   The part that was so rude, was that they would just continually drop off random plates that we didn't order. Expecting us to eat it! We want what we ordered, not some random stuff you can charge us for later.   They only asked us once if we were doing okay, and we had to ask to get our water refilled.  You know a restaurant has bad service when they can't even keep your water filled.  If you want good sushi and a good experience go down the road to Umiya Sushi. This service and sushi is not worth it.",

I just couldn't eat too much so the \"all you can eat\" thing doesn't apply to me. The place is highly decorated in a stylish Korean traditional ambiance. I went to the restroom to inspect the decoration. Usually if the outside looks good, the inside looks nice as well. It's True enough, my assessment is correct.

Waiting for like 5 more rolls still..  Last edit!! They fucking slapped a huge ass turbo and tuned on e85 700hp on the chefs.. it's been over an hour.. they're bring this shit out fast now. I bet the sushi was frozen or some shit and didn't tell us. Longest I've ever been at a sushi spot ever. Going on 2 hours now. K I'm done.

    "text": "3.5 stars at best from me.  Came here with zee boyfriend one night to give this place a try since there were many good reviews and what not. Plus, it's a new restaurant! We love to try out new places to see if they're any good or worth going to!   Sushi Neko is a sister restaurant to Sakana, therefore, same owners. I personally have never dined at Sakana so I can't compare nor do I know what to expect when coming to Neko. According to one of my friends though, from his experience at Neko, the service was severely lacking and the server that helped him was the worst.   We came here on a Thursday night and it was practically empty. There was only maybe one table occupied. AYCE sushi dinner is $25.95 while the premium is at $28.95. Premium dinner includes the specials on the blackboard that is in the middle of the room and from what one of the servers told it, it was only available for the weekends. (Or maybe not .. I wasn't really listening.)  We tried their: Salmon Carpaccio: Chef special. Meh. Doused in sauce with tasteless ikura. Pass.  Tuna Carpaccio: Chef special. Also meh. Not even sure what I was eating. Pass. Salmon: Tasteless pretty much. Second round was better. Salmon Belly: Had some fresh wasabi on top. Delicious. (One order per.) Anything Albacore: No thank you.  Hamachi: Decent. Yuzu Hamachi: Decent. If it was tasteless, I wouldn't know cause the sauce covers that. Super White Tuna: Decent. Uni: Decent. (One order per.) 300 Handroll: Three types of raw fish with a sweet-spicy sauce and rice. The sweet-spicy sauce was pretty much sriracha sauce mixed with some sugary syrup. No good.  Oysters: On half shell with some sauces on top that includes a salsa so it does have a little kick to it. The oysters weren't great but the sauces were good. (One order per.) The Shit*: Crab meat and other stuff wrapped in seaweed and deep fried. Comes with a spicy mayo sauce. Decent.  The Pang: Garlic toast topped with fish and sauce and other stuff. Delicious.  Green Tea Panna Cotta: Needs less matcha powder in its recipe.  Blanc Coffee Manger: Same type of dessert as the green tea panna cotta. Same texture, different flavor. This one was actually decent.   Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy a good portion of the things I tried at Neko. The only things that I enjoyed were \"The Pang\" but it was heavy so I can't eat too much of it and the salmon belly. However, the salmon belly was restricted to one order per person and salmon belly is my favorite nigiri ... soo definitely a minus for Neko. There was a roll that I wanted to try but I only wanted to do half a roll and Neko wasn't able to accommodate on that either. Another negative. Fresh wasabi was an extra charge of $3.00 when we asked for it...A lot of other places give it for free :(  The first server that helped us was brand new apparently. She couldn't answer 95% of our questions and also lost half of our orders so that definitely did not sit well with me. She constantly asked another server to answer our questions ...   Eventually, that other server just started taking over. He was wonderful. He was good with giving suggestions and answering everything that we wanted to know. He gave us enough time with our meal, offered to get us more dishes if we were to want them. He pretty much offered to bring us every dessert they had if we wanted it. He was an absolute pleasure to deal with. His name is Carlos. Request him if you can. He is definitely Neko's saving grace. If he were not present that night to serve us, this review would have ended up a 2 star review -- possibly 1 star.  Another plus to Neko is their fish to rice ratio. You get a huge chunk of fish and a little bit of rice so for the fish go-ers, it is heaven. However, on the flip side, if your fish quality doesn't resonate that well then fish to rice ratio isn't even something I would put into consideration.   End point. I probably wouldn't want to go again as it doesn't particularly hold up to the hype. It is a little disappointing after reading all those great reviews. But, no time limit. Eat as much as you want for as long as you want, I suppose. They also have an offer going on? Write a review and you get a free upgrade to your AYCE from regular dinner to premium dinner or get a cup.",

    "text": "NEVER AGAIN!!!   I saw mixed reviews on this place. I decided to try it out myself. One review that really got me interested was the one that said this place is better than Goyemon. And I do like Goyemon. So, let's give it a try.   My take on that review: BULL! The food here is no where near Goyemon's quality.   You know those fast food items never looked as good as their pictures? Well, this place reminded me of that. I don't know if the owners or friends of this place posted a bunch pics or maybe some previous visitors got lucky. My food did not look like any of them. For example, the Agedashi Tofu looked and tasted like it was soaked in sauce since yesterday. The shrimps on the skewers looked like earthworm. It was pathetic. There were sands in my Miso Soup. I kid you not. The seaweeds looked like they've already gone bad. I wanted to order the specials on the board, but the waiter said they're for dinner only. But they didn't write that on the board.   Bottom line, I'm disappointed and will not eat there again. I could have given this place a 2-star, but seeing all those 4/5 star reviews, I felt the need to correct the curve.   I usually don't write reviews. And even when I do, it's never this long. But this time I really felt the urge to share my experience. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": "I was so excited about this place because of the high rating on yelp.. I must say that this is the worst sushi place I've ever been to in vegas. This makes me believe that the reviews are highly inflated because they are doing a promotion where if you leave them a good yelp review, they give you a mug cup or upgrade the all you can eat to premium all you can eat.   We came here as a party of 4 and we all got all you can eat and ordered a bunch of food. I must say that the nigiri are decent and has a good fish to rice proportion like they advertise. That's the only good thing I can say about this place..   There's so many bad things about this place that I don't know where to start. The biggest thing about this place is that the food takes indefinite amount of time to come. It literally takes anywhere from 10-20min for each item to come. We asked the server repeatedly where our food is and he had to retake our same order. This happened 4 times. The wait was so long that we brought card games from my car so that we could play while waiting for the food.   Next is the service. When we had to repeat our order multiple times, we got zero apology. No sorry no nothing. He told us that he'll put us in a \"priority list\" to get our food quick to us but then the food had only come out at \"regular\"speed (we had time to go through a few rounds of Uno while waiting). The salmon belly was the first thing we ordered and it was the last thing we received 3 hours later and asking for it 5 times. And yes we stayed 3 hours and didn't even leave full because of how long the wait was for each item. We couldn't wait anymore and promptly decided to end our meal. However, they were quick to serve our desserts and give us our checks.   I must say the food here is very overrated. Yes the nigiri has a good fish to rice proportion but after waiting for too long, the taste diminishes significantly.  The rolls are on par with other sushi joints. The appetizer however is pretty bad. The kalbi steak was chewy and cold. The salmon and yellowtail kama were both overcooked and dry. The kfc appetizer had some kind of weird bbq sauce that didn't work with the chicken. The pork belly was pretty good and probably the best thing at this restaurant. The oysters wasn't cleaned properly and I almost threw up eating them.   Overall this establishment needs a major work in its customer service : ensuring that all orders come out, no orders that are lost are Falsely claimed to be on their way,  and to apologize for any inconveniences.",

The sushi at Neko is good, and as many yelpers have commented the nigiri is one of the better in town. Highlights for me were the garlic & cajun tuna as well as the paprika salmon.   Beyond that there's nothing much that stands out about this place as far as food. I think that's a common theme nowadays in Vegas, the lack of distinction with the AYCE genre of sushi establishments.",

Came in around 7pm on Friday evening, the whole restaurant was packed. We were seated within minutes of arrival. One thing I have to first point out is that the staff's productivity deserves an A+!!!!! Everyone that worked here was busy working!! We did AYCE for two ($25.95). We ordered off of every part of the menu (Appetizers, nigiri, soup, hand rolls, and tempura rolls). They only do half rolls for 8pc rolls and dessert is one item only. Would definitely come back because there's so many more things I want to try. Based on my bf's opinion their rice to sushi ratio is more sushi than rice! Definitely cute place for date night",

    "text": "For those of you that actually live in Las Vegas,  I.Envy.You  All you can eat sushi places in NY do not hold a candle to Sushi Neko. Instead of staring at impossible large mounds of white rice, Sushi Neko truly provides an excellent fish to rice ratio, better than some of the A la Carte restaurants you can find in NY. Being able to truly give your customers a high quality product alongside the quantity desired is a recipe that many places dont get right. Neko has nailed it.  Not only is the fish to rice ratio amazing, but the quality of the fish itself far exceeds that of any other AYCE sushi place I have been to. Never have I experienced such quality in both freshness and abundance in a buffet before. Truly truly amazing.  The cooked food is no slouch either. The pork belly simply melts in your mouth and the bulgogi is tender and rich. I also absolutely love their salmon kama!! Their entire menu could fetch for astronomical prices in NY, and yet the deal is AYCE. Mind-boggling.  The price sums up this wonderful gem. 20.95 for lunch and 26.95 for dinner. Most AYCE restaurants in NY charge around 25 for weekday lunch and upwards of 27 for weekend lunch, with dinner always being a few dollars extra.  Sushi Neko took up 3 of our 7 dinners during our stay in Las Vegas. It was all I could think about after the first visit. It is the only restaurant I can think about even after coming back to NY.  Truly truly a gem. I have not been to a more perfect place.",

The quality, cleanliness, and presentation of this establishment speaks for itself.  Their All You Can Eat menu has a really good selection. You're able to do half order on almost all the rolls and their fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is awesome! (See photo) Like all AYCE restaurants, they charge for any leftovers, including rice. This can make you full faster, but it helps when the rice portions are much smaller.  If you do decide to do AYCE, one dessert per person is included. I highly recommend getting the tempura ice-cream. It's not overly sweet and the portion is just right. Their mochi ice-cream and honey toast are pretty good as well.  If you feel like you want the sushi to just keep on coming and you're not in a big party, the restaurant does have a bar. But no matter where you sit, the service is always great and the staff will keep coming back to see if you would like to order anything else.  Don't hesitate to try this place out! If you love sushi just as much as I do, you won't be disappointed. ;]  Pro-Tips: -There is a time limit for AYCE -They DO NOT accept American Express",

We visited for lunch one day and found the standard of Sushi way below what we were used to.   The rolls were loose and not uniformed. At one point the roll was almost three inches wide. The salmon was cut along the grain and the rice was too compacted. I even had to return a soda because it was flat when I opened it.

The 3 of us came in for AYCE on a busy Friday night around 6PM and waited 15 minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated we looked at the menu while our server got us our drinks. First round, we ordered a variety of appetizers like shrimp tempura, gyoza, calamari, miso, etc. which were all good and arrived at our table in a timely matter.   We also ordered nigiri such as tuna, garlic tuna, tako (octopus), scallop, squid, salmon, and yellowtail. I am so impressed by the quality of fish and portion size our nigiri was given to us. The tuna was a fresh red and melted in our mouths as were the other fishes. The fish to rice ratio is 3:1 and is one of the reasons why Sushi Neko earns the top spot on my go to AYCE sushi.   The service was excellent. Servers were very attentive and always checked on us once in a while if we were okay and if we wanted to order more. Food runners were quick and also attentive, consistently checking on us, picking up our empty plates, and refilling our waters. Everyone was very polite as well.   Throughout the rest of the evening we reordered apps and nigiri and a few rolls. The Dragon, Tiger, Shrimp Tempura, and Spicy Crab Rolls were yummy. They were nicely presented and not overdone with crumbs or sauce.  Lastly, we topped off our meal with dessert. Multiple orders of Green Tea and Red Bean ice cream. The Green Tea Panna Cotta was delicious and the honey toast was good and not too sweet.   I am always throughly satisfied with every experience I have here. I highly recommend trying this place, you won't be disappointed.",

Coming from a city that is about AYCE sushi, this one completely blew my mind. It wasn't just sushi I could order, but handrolls, hot food, desserts and other random things I never seen or heard. I was highly impressed with the variety and the quality of the food. Yes, the plates are small but it was perfect because that meant more room to try other things!   I ate so much I kind of forgot what exactly I ordered but the green tea panacotta at the end was a great note to conclude the meal. I do remember how the cajun tuna nigiri was so silky and fresh...mmm...I can do for some right now. Oh yes...and the sushi roll with peanut butter in it! That was quite an interesting but flavorful taste that reminded me of a Thai dish. It actually tasted good!   I came in hungry and I left with a food baby and ready to go into a coma. When I come back to Vegas, I am def coming back here.",

I noticed our server, Son, had multiple tables but was still was still kind and very attentive.   My only complaint about this place was the blaring K-pop music that made it difficult to converse.",

We did have regular water refills though which prevents this for being a 2.  Appetizers:  We always get the bacon and scallops no matter where we go if it's an option. Good as usual   The shit - honestly overrated (sadly using this word right now). My friend Anna and I didn't really understand the hype.  What you should try is the pang which was overwhelming in flavor and deliciousness. No pics since we inhaled them.  Rolls/ things we recommend:   The Chanel roll - a perfect blend of fresh sashimi on top to compliment the fried tempura shrimp  Paprika salmon - their version of smoke salmon sashimi and wow that was a game changer - never thought paprika could elicit such feelings of happiness. I'd almost say it trumps the salmon belly.  Salmon belly - do recommend but honestly the paprika salmon won actually.  Honestly anything with salmon here was phenomenal! We had the stuffed tomato riceless roll which was almost all salmon and that tasted delicious! Trust me it's nothing with tomatoes!  Any of the rice less rolls ( they change from day to day depending on fish availability and chef) we got the stuffed tomato?   Popcorn lobster was meh - too much yum yum sauce and we had the same problem with the coconut shrimp roll. You could not taste anything but yum yum or whatever that sauce was. They were both drowned in it.  Lobster special was the same sauce like the pang except with seafood which was awesome  Don't recommend the coco shrimp as there was hardly any coconut and it was drowning in yum yum sauce.  Things to note as you're browsing Yelp - they no longer have the Kalbi  and don't be afraid to pull up Yelp to ask!",

Portions and prices are extremely fair especially for the quantity and quality of the food you get.   My fiance and I have been to this restaurant easily 60 + times and have enjoyed our time here every visit. The beautiful Decor the Ghibli inspired artwork really adds to the wonderful atmosphere.   My major complaint, is that all 60+ visits have been to the bar, every time I've sat here with my fiance we visit the bar to enjoy the company and solidarity of the bar area. Staff have informed us on our most recent visit that the bar was removed, a huge portion of our sushi experience has been ruined and sitting at the tables feels incredibly isolation from our traditional Neko experience. I implore this \"new management\" to allow reseating at the bar. Bar sushi is a part of almost all sushi restaurants. Terrible decision to take this away from your experience.   Please take into consideration that the actual restaurant is phenomenal and the food is out of this world, but sitting at a table scribbling on paper feels like I've lost a lot of what made Neko truly special.",

Pretty good value considering it includes a variety of appetizers and choice of dessert.   APPETIZERS Fried rice - nothing special.  Shrimp tempura - yummy! Hard to mess up.  Pang - crab mix on top a crunchy, buttery toast. Egg rolls - Super oily. Did not care for the filling.  SUSHI Nigiri is pretty good here with great fish to rice ratio. It is True that the garlic ponzu sauce is awesome. They have sushi burritos listed on the menu. I ordered the hulk burrito (soy paper) and I got a regular cut roll with seaweed paper. Umm...lol. I'm not big on rolls, but they offer 1/2 rolls! I tried the lemon roll and the Chanel roll. I've had a better lemon roll, but I would get the Chanel roll again.   DESSERT  Sounds good on paper, but it was just okay for me. The desserts are on the small side and nothing really stood out. The green tea panna cotta is probably the best choice, but not mind blowing. The mini honey toast is definitely \"mini.\" It's basically the size of a Hawaiian roll. Sad that the toast was burnt and the vanilla ice cream was more icy than creamy.   I loved the interior and the service was great!  *****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge***** 9/100",

I had like a 3:1 ratio of fish to rice!! Crazy!!  ***ORDER THE PANG APPETIZER!!!!!****  We ordered salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, yellowtail, albacore and red snapper nigiri. The Albacore was so good!!! Everything else was good too, but the albacore stayed on my taste buds for a hot minute. MMM-MMM! The garlic tuna and tuna nigiri really didn't have much of a difference, other than a bit of garlic on the tuna.  We then ordered a few rolls and good thing we decided on half rolls, because those portions were HUGE! We ordered the No. 1 Chef Makes, Hawaiian, Be Sexy Tonight and Be Happy. Out of these 4, I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend the Be Sexy Tonight! It was sooooo good!  Downside is their dessert isn't that great; but I came for sushi not dessert. I got the green tea ice cream and it was hard as a rock and didn't taste like green tea. It had a weird taste to it.... I also got the tiramisu. Flavor was lacking as well; and like the pictures showed, it's tiny.",

Then, on the table, there was a sign that said \"check-in on yelp and get a free soda\", which we did, but when we showed the waitress she said no you HAVE to write a review.. it's like we were forced to make a review to get a free soda... it just was a little misleading. I mean overall it is a decent sushi spot and the price is ok for AYCE, food was good and it came out kind of fast, it's just today it felt like our table was being ignored in the beginning of us arriving, and it took a while for them to come back to us when we wanted to order more.

Good rice to fish ratio, check.   ....so far so good. Then my server dropped a bomb: \"oh we are out of salmon belly\"  what? I live and breathe for salmon belly I almost had an heart attack but no worries. This was something that never happened at Sakana so it was a bit of shock to me.   I do have to mention that green tea pannacotta is made differently here. It was not as creamy as I remembered it to be from Sakana. Texture was chalky and the color was similar to unripe avocado. I was really disappointed.   Something interesting they do here is that you write a review and you either get their special mug or their premium menu (usually ~$28) for just $25.95.  CONCLUSION I will visit again for their amazing service and sushi!",

    "text": "I've seen AYCE sushi places start out so well then fizzle out after a few years...or even months. Knife cuts get sloppy, rice to fish ratio becomes carb-centric, the service turns from a budding female to a woman with hot flashes. Before any of that happens, it's good to try Sushi Neko before it turns into a crazy kitty. Kind of like how I was when I called a friend for a food emergency and ended up here.   The first thing I noticed was the very anime-themed interior. Slam Dunk on one wall, Hayao Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\" on loop, and the colorful menu. It's bright and spacious which is a nice change.  We tried quite several apps, rolls, nigiri, and desserts. Salmon, garlic tuna, tomato roll, salmon paprika, tower of sashimi, Sashimj roll, Be Happy roll, lemon salmon, The Shit, skewers, green tea Panna cotta, and coffee Blanc manger.  Overall, the fish was fresh with a good rice ratio. We left satisfied. We probably overstayed our welcome - I saw \"Spirited Away\" from start to finish twice!",

It's soooo delicious. The service is amazing. Atmosphere is quite delightful. And the sushi is phenomenal. I really hope that that doesn't die down after all the \"hype\" follows.   Their fish is super fresh. The chef gave us a specialty sashimi type of appetizer and it was really yummy. Their fish to rice ratio is awesome. There is no place in Vegas that's like that. I've only been to one in Cali, and this one outshines that sushi place.   I was actually quite surprised at how big the place is, especially because sakana is so tiny. After I had it, I told all my friends about it. Definitely going to be the hot sushi spot...for now. :) Don't mess up, Sushi Neko!",

I like this place so much I decided to hang out and wait until 12... at 12 they said that the kitchen still wasn't ready and they would open at 12:30... I was so hungry and irritated at that point that I went elsewhere. Another time I can for dinner service and the staff was very inattentive... I had to flag down servers in order to Place an order. I don't know if hot appetizers were slow or not but I ordered a deep fried item which took forever to get delivered to my table",

    "text": "I'm here to put this place on the map!   If you told me that I could get amazing fish to rice ratio at an All You Can Eat Sushi spot, without the long wait, you can count your pretty nigiri I'll be there! They're conveniently situated in the prime of China Town, on Spring Mountain - right next door to Yosi Vapor Boutique and under Hue Thai & Cafe Teaze. Unfortunately, the signage blends in and is somewhat hidden in the corner of the Asian strip mall, so easily missed if you're not looking for it. The restaurant is decorated beautifully with plenty of comfortable seating, plus there's ample parking; I won't be surprised if it picks up real soon!   Neko is the sister restaurant of the tried and True, wildly successful Sakana on Maryland! I'll be the first to admit, we're biased. We absolutely love Sakana and try to eat there every meal we can, but they are a lot further from home plus it can get pretty busy during prime dining hours. Neko is offering the same delicious AYCE sushi, nigiri & appetizer menu and since not many people figured it out yet, they aren't busy! The fish to rice ratio here is great, better than any of their competitors; we've been to them all!   These are what AYCE dreams are made of: (I love that you can also get half sized rolls so that you can try more!)  - Salmon Belly Nigiri  - Ocean Trout Nigiri - Albacore 300 Nigiri  - Yuzu Yellowtail Nigiri - Uni Nigiri - Ama Ebi Nigiri  - Unagi Nigiri - Super White Tuna Nigiri  - Garlic Tuna Nigiri  - Albacore Garlic Ponzu Nigiri - House made Tamago! Omg sooo perfect!  - Baked Green Mussels  - Poke Nachos - Pang - Jalapeno Poppers - D's Guy Roll - Lemon Salmon Roll - \"The best of the best\" (rice-less) - \"Stuffed Tomato\" (rice-less) - it's not really a tomato, it's actually surimi crab rolled inside salmon and topped with avocado, tropical salsa and ponzu! Super tasty! - Their house sauces: 300 & garlic ponzu are spectacular. I love them! Pairs great with all of their nigiri - Mini honey toast & Mochi for dessert - the perfect ending!   I can go on forever, there's so much more! Even the pickiest eater can find something they'll enjoy! The have cooked items that are great as well, but I come for the raw fish and appetizers. Service always exceeds expectations and the food comes out quick. Chef Dragon really cares about his customer's and his food is made with love - you are in good hands! Also, Carlos our server is on top of his game - Don't even trip, he's got you! They consistently offer quality cuts of fish and explosive flavors that we expect, which keeps us coming back for more!",

I die. I'm also obsessed with the smoked paprika salmon. It is so good!! I would've taken a photo of that but literally inhaled it in 10 seconds. It is also BOGO alcohol all day, errrday. That's crazy but ok, come thru. Also, not sure if this also happens to anyone else, but I always look at the dessert section of AYCE sushi menus and it is STACKED. I was with 3 other friends and we all ordered ice cream and another dessert for ourselves. No judgment, but so good. The atmosphere is so cute and so aesthetic so you can take great photos for the gram and Yelp. Lit. This is definitely my new favorite place to come for AYCE, I loved it!!",

They are one of the very few AYCE sushi restaurants in town that uses whole soft shell crab in their rolls. Most of them use some chopped up mysterious mix.

However, I was again left in disappointment because it had a ton of  mayo on it and the crab itself actually had no flavor.

I just didn't like how the girls bathroom was locked and the guys bathroom bowl was dirty sorry... you guys need a little clean. Here and there.

I've never seen a sushi restaurant serve nigiri with this kind of rice to fish ratio - but it's a GOOD thing because I try not to each so much carbs in the first place!!   We ordered a bunch of nigiri and tried almost everything I think, and also the Burning Your Ass Roll. This place does half rolls which is GREAT because I can barely finish a whole roll by myself in the first place. Fish was really good and tasted fresh. We didn't dive too hard into their appetizers but I really liked their gyoza!  Service was a little ehh, because it took a long time to flag down a server for our next round of orders and ended up having huge breaks in between eating. I also asked for water FOUR TIMES!!! from THREE DIFFERENT SERVERS!!! before I ever got my water refilled. I can understand that it was starting to get busy - but dang, what's a girl gotta do around here for some water though! Considering I'm not from Vegas, I think I would still give it a shot next time I'm here. Sometimes quality of food trumps one day of bad service.",

We came on a Tuesday and the restaurant was pretty full, however it was apparent that it was understaffed. We waited long to order, for our order, and our water cups were never filled.   Anything fried tasted burnt. They either needed to change their oil or overcooked it all. They also made everything spicier than most places. The amoebi and oysters literally burned my throat. With all of the sushi options in Vegas, I doubt I'll give this place a go again.",

I will be back soon    First off, the decor: the restaurant is super cool and unique, they play kpop and have multiple TVs all over to watch the music videos.   Second off, the menu: it was very big and had a lot of items to choose from, mostly sushi rolls. All the appetizers I had were tasty, ESPECIALLY the baked mussels. The rolls we tried were also very flavorful. But my favorite was the nigiri. Covered in toppings and sauces and flavors I've never seen before! I could fill up just on just the nigiri. A great selection for dessert as well :)  Lastly, the service: Everyone we talked to was super nice, we went in 1.5 hours before closing and despite this everyone was great.    My new favorite sushi spot :)",

The menu cracks me up! Some of the names of the rolls got me rolling on the floor. Not to mention the menu is HUGE and EVERYTHING, I repeat, Everything is available for the AYCE pricing! Certain items are limited (like my favorite, uni) but the fact that you can still get it blows my mind!  As we were waiting for our entire party to arrive, someone was celebrating their birthday. They play this epic, high intensity birthday extravaganza song and strobe the lights and make it a huge ordeal. It was so cool! Happy Birthday to whoever you are!  After your meal, you also get to order dessert! Which was also included in the pricing. Unfortunately, you only get one dessert lol  I never would've thought to try AYCE sushi in Vegas, but this place is pretty cool! If I'm ever in Chinatown, I will probably hit up this place.  Thanks for reading my reviews! Let me know what I should try next!!",

    "text": "Sushi Neko is my go to AYCE sushi spot for Vegas. The freshness and quality of the cuts of fish is great, especially with the all you can eat component. I love their Salmon, Salmon Belly, Eel, Super White Tuna, Ocean Trout, and Tamago nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is impressive. We ordered the uni once, and it didn't seem super fresh at the time, so I would make sure to ask if it's fresh before ordering. For the rolls, I really suggest the Monkey Brain since it comes with a tempura banana as the base, which adds a sweeter component to the spicy crab and eel sauce toppings. Some other rolls I've liked are the Lisa Lisa Roll, Chanel Roll, Snow in Vegas Roll, and Playboy Baked Roll.   The menu is so vast, and they offer a large selection of warm/cold appetizers and side dishes. Apart from the sushi, I really enjoy the mini udon, the Neko style fried rice, and the Tempura Ice Cream for dessert. I am also impressed with their really quick service and how fast dishes come out. This place is great for large groups and also smaller parties.",

To start: the interior is cute, cozy, and welcoming, and the food is quite good. Some reviews claim their entrees are doused in sauce; I haven't experienced this. The service, on the other hand, has had some strange quirks and wrinkles to it lately. I tried their AYCE menu for the first time not too long ago with friends on a moderately busy Saturday and service was slow and spotty. Our orders were forgotten about on several occasions, to the point that we felt like we were being seen as burdensome for all opting for AYCE.  Something else concerning: they don't answer their phone much anymore, which sucks since Sushi Neko is the kind of restaurant that's grown so popular that calling ahead is essential. I really hope the hiccups aren't a sign of things to come and they aren't falling victim to their own success, because they've been phenomenal to me up to the last few visits.",

    "text": "Third time will not be a charm. Here's the thing, fish to rice ratio is crazy!  Big cuts of fish with basically 12 grains of rice, seriously. Hubs and I were in awe. Your excitement might actually deflect from reality. I mean, I easily got excited myself until I started eating my nigiris. Chewy cuts, and not the greatest quality of fish. I mean, at AYCES...one shouldn't expect top grade fish, but all I'm saying is...please don't feed us the chewy ones. Just our dang luck I tell you.  Service was suppppper slow, however friendly. I did my usual order of salmon skin and spicy tuna because it's so basic it helps me gauge the place...and it was disgusting. Salmon skin tasted like it was cooked the day before. Matter of fact, seemed like there was barely any salmon skin. The rice on the rolls were too wet. Eek. I had a lousy experience with the same two selections at another sushi spot, and it reignited old feelings. My spicy tuna has the right spicy but just lacked in flavor. I ordered a few other things non sushi related and was just meh.   Also, they failed to bring out 1 of my husband's order, forgot the name...but that was quite all right because by then...the husband had to spit out a few of his nigiris, yet, was full from his other orders anyway.   Honestly, the best thing about my experiences were the edamame and mochi ice cream...nothing about their sushi and nigiri had me wanting to return a 3rd time. If friends wanted to come here to eat, of course I'd come...not that much of a party pooper and wasn't thaaaat disgusted. Just know there's other solid sushi spots for us to go to.   Decor and layout is certainly cute! That was my favorite thing about the place. I wanted to love it considering the rice to fish ratio. It was a disappointment for me/us. My husband who is a sucker for sashimi/nigiris and pretty easy to please...was disappointed himself. So if the garbage disposal spits food back out...just saying.  The ayce is actually a pretty good price, that's probably where I can see why people rave about it. But I wonder how many times do I need to come back to warrant the same 4 or 5 stars? Hmmm....  People gave reviewed about how busy they are. Fortunately, the times we've come it wasn't and we didn't have a wait. For this, I'd  say they're kid friendly and you could manage to safely have a stroller in there IF they aren't busy.   Still, it's worth a try. The price for AYCE, rice-to-fish ratio...it really is a good deal. Again, to each experience is their own. Maybe you'll have a better one.  Enjoy!",

It looked tiny, but the restaurant was accommodating a lot of people without it being crowded. Service was very fast, too. Less than two minutes after ordering, our plates came in already. And their servings were surprisingly huge. The fish to rice ratio of their Nigiri was impressive. Their rolls are good as well. But I recommend the ocean trout nigiri and the something wrong roll. The only problem I had though were their desserts, which I would recommend that you pass. Other than that, I would definitely be back for the sushi and the ambiance.",

The sushi was really fresh too, and the appetizer was better than most izakaya that I have been to. The atmosphere of the place was also modern and it had good japanese vibe which I really liked. In addition, there is another location called Sakana and both are great. Every time I come to Vegas I always bring my friends to  this restaurant or Sakana, and they really love this place too. So Thank you sushi Neko! Will definitely come back again, and",

This place attracts a young crowd with a good feel vibe for social meetings. All the items were available unlike at Goyemon where they seem to always say Uni was not available on many visits. This place is good in what they do and they deliver along with turning the tables as soon as one becomes available. If you want a positive energy experience for an excellent variety of sushi and tapas like dishes, then this is it.  My favorites were the one order limit sushi items, belly pork and pang pang.  Great venue, great food, excellent service for the young and young at heart.",

I saw at least five open tables. He walked around looking confused and argued with several severs, then came back saying they don't have any tables for one person and it'll be a half hour wait for one to come available. I was like, what about all of those other tables? It wasn't like they were busy, it was lunch time. But then he immediately sat a party for two. It felt pretty insulting tbh so I just left and went to another place up the street. So I don't think I'm ever coming back with my friends. There are so many other great sushi places, and it felt so insulting they wouldn't seat me. I eat lunch alone all the time, and I seriously have never had that happen to me.",

Not like any Japanese or Asian restaurant in general where I feel like were packed in a sardine can, this place is very spacious.  We were a party of 12. The place is not really made for more than party of 6. So our table had to split. But we were still right next to each other. Which is not bad. We came at the wrong time. It was kinda busy and it seems like they are short of staff. We did had to wait several minutes before we finally got our rolls. But it's probably because they are short staff and their were other tables as well. I did order the pang (which is supposedly the highly requested one) but I never got it. I told them several times. But just never got it. Which is okay because we are already stuffed. But I did wanted to try it.   Even though we had to wait for our food for several minutes. I love the employees. Specially our server. I'm not sure if his name is sunny. But that's what it says in the receipt. They were so patient with us 12 even though we were confusing. They never showed that they were annoyed or anything. 5 star customer service. Great job you guys!",

The menu is still in progress since, of course, they're Hot and New.  I find it more convenient to come here since it is closer to most of my friends. But, PARKING may become difficult to secure.   Kevin was our server this time and he was awesomely interactive. The others were kind and accomodating as well. If you plan to become a server of some sort, perhaps come here because they're practically role models.",

    "text": "Great AYCE sushi. They have really good rice to fish ratio. The nigiri barely has any rice with huge fish pieces. The time limit is one hour and it's enough time because they make everything super fast, even though we came at an awkward time with not too many people I was still amazed by their speed because we ordered a lot of food. There was only one waitress serving multiple tables each time we went and they were both super fast and never got our orders wrong. I feel like I should stop trying other AYCE sushi places now because Sushi Neko is hard to beat. However, we suspected that it's owned by the same people that own Hwaro KBBQ since some appetizers have the same unique names, and another review just confirmed it. We had a bad experience at Hwaro due to their horrible service and they should really learn from Sushi Neko because they are doing it right.",

The fish used was NOT fresh,  sashimi cuts were too big and uneven; thus, chewy and hard to eat. Sushi rolls were ok, the ratio between rice and fish was highly unproportional and some of flavor combinations did not make sense. Would not recommend for authentic or even close to original Japanese cuisine.",

    "text": "WOW. I can't believe what happened today at this restaurant. We have been here multiple times and always enjoy coming here when we crave for sushi. But today, I came here with a friend and we asked for split checks. The girl brought back the checks as separated and on mine check it did not have a copy for me to sign. I thought they had run my card but just forgot to give me a copy for me to leave gratuity. As we are leaving, the server asked us if we split our check, we said yes and the copies are on the table. We then continue walking to our car and the next thing that happened is the server ran out from the restaurant and stopped us, wanting us to pay because the girl at the register did not charge my card. Okay seriously, what the hell? You gonna chase people down the parking lot for your mistake for not charging my card? Unbelievable! And, why didn't you said anything as we were leaving the restaurant? WOW. Honestly, we love the food here but because of this experience, I'll never come back here again. Along with this, on a Saturday there should be more staffing. We were sitting for about 10 minutes until someone can get our order or let us re-order again. So disappointed because the food is delicious. Maybe you guys should coach your employees on this....",

Their dinner is AYCE for $25.95pp and there are a lot of options to choose from. We wanted to try everything! We followed the rules they have on their menu and ordered little by little and were full after these dishes:  3 Miso soups - 5/5 so tasty and perfect with the sushi  The Shit appetizer - 5/5 very unique dish, it was bursting with flavor and had a nice crunch... I did ask the waiter what it was but I totally forgot!    Pork Belly - 5/5 cooked perfectly w/ a nice meat to fat ratio  Call 911 Roll - 5/5 not too spicy but definitely had a kick, all the flavors worked very well together   No. 1 Chef Makes Roll - 5/5 just plain amazing, was recommended to us by our waiter  Bam Bam Roll - 4/5 they used a good amount of fish and it tasted so fresh, it was lovely but this roll didn't have a huge burst of flavor like the others  Burning Your Ass Roll - 2/5 this had a kind of sour taste that I wasn't too fond of  Affogato - 5/5 was to die for!! Korean coffee, vanilla ice cream, crunchy flakes... what could go wrong?!  Tempura Ice Cream - 4/5 the tempura was nice and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, I liked it but the tempura got a little too soggy on the inside.  Our waiter was very attentive, we never had to wait around to make another order. Our food came out very quickly. We were always equipped with everything we needed.   The interior is SO CUTE! I couldn't stop saying how cute everything was! The decorations, tables, menus... absolutely everything in this place is just adorable!!  We will definitely return!!",

Very fun to look at while you enjoy your sushi!  My boyfriend and I came for the all-you-can-eat dinner, which was about $25/dinner on a weekend night. Score!  They offered appetizers, sushi, hand rolls, dishes like curry katsu, and dessert.  When we first got there (around 6pm on a weekend night), we saw a wait outside and were prepared for a long wait.  Nope, we got seated immediately!  The larger groups had to wait awhile but the smaller the better for a place like this.  Service is quick but still friendly.  You can tell all the workers are working very hard.  We ordered a few nigiri, rolls, and appetizers to start and it all came out in lightening speed, maybe a little more than 5 minutes.  I was so impressed.  We wound up ordering probably 4 times, and each time we were served very quick!  All the food was fresh and so yummy.  My favorite was the salmon belly (only 1 order per person unfortunately), and the shrimp tempura roll.  My boyfriend and I ordered 4 of these between the 2 of us..hehe.  I got the mini honey toast for dessert which comes with a scoop of ice cream and that was all my stomach could handle.  SO good and left feeling so full!  I can't wait to go here again whenever I'm back in Vegas!",

There's almost too much flavor. You should also try the cajun tuna. Don't forget the appetizers. I had the Korean Fried Chicken and \"the s***\" which is deep fried seaweed and salmon. Dessert is part of the AYCE too, so unlike other times don't skip dessert.  The setting of the restaurant is quite interesting. There's like three different places to sit. You got a well lit area with high tables or booths. A dim lit area, but has sort of a glow, with standard tables. Then there's a small area that's really confined. Can be a great spot for couples. They also play K Pop music so if you're into that then that's a plus.",

I think what i liked most about this place was that sushi was really fresh to me AND their nigiri's fish to rice ratio was on point! I think you guys know what im talking about.. Some sushi joints have way too much rice for a small piece of fish so you get fuller faster. But theirs was 70% fish to 30% rice and i was crying, so good!   I loved their variety of appetizers and desserts. The menu even had suggestions of what to try so I listened to them and i was not disappointed. Their mussels omg!! Ive tried a lot of sushi places with some weak dessert game but i got a little honey toast here which i thought was pretty original. I have loved going to oyshi for too long and i needed a new sushi restaurant and i definitely found it!! I will be back, i wanna go back tomorrow LOL meow af.",

What makes this spot above the others is the food . The fish to rice ratio is great (probably a little too much fish ) . They have a large amount of appetizers which I've had most and cannot complain . The specials on the boards also do not Disappoint. Overall it's a A+++ spot that we will be going to instead of the others in town.    Update : have been back many times and can still say that it's just as good and the service I had today was outstanding !",

    "text": "MEOW! Heard about this place from a friend, who boasted this was her new go-to because of their amazing rice to fish ratio. Had to check it out for myself! $20.95 for AYCE lunch (until 4:00pm), $25.95 for AYCE dinner. Was a little put off that we had to be put on a wait list despite there being many tables available (they said it was due to the kitchen being backed up with orders). Never heard of this before, but I tried to keep an open mind -- as the space as well as decor was very appealing. Incase you didn't know, NEKO means cat in Japanese -- so the recurring theme throughout was obviously feline, which is so cute! We took the wait time to look over the menu, as it is surprisingly extensive with so many options.  I don't think I can say this about anywhere else, but I enjoyed EVERYTHING we ordered off the menu. This included:  - the shit (x3) - pang (x2) - baked green mussels (x6) - oysters (x2) - shrimp skewer - bacon scallop skewer - salmon nigiri - spider roll  - wet dream - baked lobster - grand canyon roll  - king of the lobster roll  - lisa lisa roll  - crab cucumber salad - mini honey toast  It's True, the fish to sushi ratio is unlike any other... the salmon easily wrapped AROUND the rice! We left full and satisfied -- and we will definitely be back to try more off the menu soon!  PRO TIP: They also offer buy one get one free every day on all their alcohol (beer, draft beer, wine, house sake, soju, flavored sake, yaegaki, nigori)!",

On my last visit they had added a few dinner specials you can also order as part of AYCE which included salmon canapes, I ordered and the waitress apologized for not having cream cheese and said they were replacing it with guacamole instead...um no apologies needed for that substitution! :D    The only thing I'm not too happy about is that they don't have the buy one get one free beer special they used to have when I first started eating here. Other than that I have no complaints. The fish is always fresh and the fish to rice ratio is unbelievable, definitely come hungry and wear your thanksgiving pants.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time last night and I was impressed. The restaurant was nice and clean, they have smaller tables toward the front and bigger tables toward the back.   The price for dinner is $26 plus buy one drink get one free all day every day! The menu is pretty big, they have oysters and sea urchin, nice variety of desserts including green tea pana cotta, mini honey toast and of course mochi and ice cream. They have a lot of different rolls, including a few with lobster (haven't seen any other place with rolls that have lobster meat!!), also have a good variety of nigiri too.   Stand out items: white tuna was superb!! so soft, sweet and melts in your mouth. The uni was also amazing, very sweet, very decadent, served cold and was delicious! Wish we could have gotten more!! Their spicy garlic edamame was actually  spicy (unlike other places where it is pretty mild) and had tons of garlic which was delicious! Their rolls were very good, nice variety, nice sauce and decent portion.   Pros: The rice here is very small and the slice of fish is big...which was awesome! We actually got to eat more fish since the rice was small. They have a good selection of rolls that are half order so you can try more without being too full.   Cons: Each person gets 1 order of oyster, but 1 order is only 1 piece whereas other places gives you 2 pieces per order. The miso soup did not have tofu which was strange (I thought tofu in miso soup was a must!!).   Service was pretty good, very attentive, drinks were constantly refilled and dirty plates were immediately picked up. Although our server did forget a few of our items and we had to remind him a few times, not a big deal. Food also came out quickly.  Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place out and I will definitely return.",

I really like that.  Strategy for all you can eat places.  There are some items you can only order once which you should order it at the beginning.  This way rest of items you can order as much as you can.  However, order only what you can consume.  Enjoy!",

Also they give you more fish than rice which is unlike most AYCE spots out here. I highly recommend the Cajun tuna nigiri! Also they let you order half rolls.   The servers were very sweet and attentive but I think what impressed me the most about this place (minus the food) was the decor! There are cool looking trees throughout the restaurant with cool vintage looking lanterns. Also there's a ton of cat themed pictures especially in the bathrooms. So cute! I also notice their music is kinda j-poppy. I guess I like that this place is more quirky and modern than many sushi spots that all look the same.   This is definitely my new AYCE spot!",

There's select items only for non AYCE or dinner one time orders only.  The fish was decent and they didn't give you a large amount of rice with each piece like other AYCE places.  Staff was pretty good and fast.  You also get dessert with the AYCE, including unlimited ice cream!  Overall, clean and good restaurant.",

After several minutes trying to decide what to eat we placed our orders.  It didn't take long before the orders started to be placed on our table.   No complaints about any of the orders.  We ordered so many types of sushi and one by one it was gone. Yum. The service is second to none.  Compared to all the other All You Can Eat Sushi places we tried this one was the best.  We now have a NEW favorite sushi place to eat!  We'll definitely be back!!!",

Very rustic, almost felt like we were in Japan with the cherry blossoms and trees (they were fake) and pictures of beautiful Geisha's painted on the wall. We ordered almost everything on the menu and they have a huge variety of different sushi on their menu. You wouldn't even know what to order. I was very pleased. Everything I ate was so good. I recommend trying everything, might as well right? Some of my favorites were the Pang, Baked Mussel, Crab Dynamite and the Golden Tiger. Sadly whatever you dont finish, they would charge you Ala Carte. so make sure you have a very big appetite or try not to order too much at one time. I'll be back when I'm in Vegas again.",

We got the kids order after we finished the 4 rolls and took another 30 mins of a wait to order more rolls. The server never came to check on us. He was going around all other table except ours. We got up after waiting for a long time and wanted to talk to the manager he still wanted to charge us at least 2 rolls even though it's upon there fault of lack of service of a wait. We always come here and sadly it's the last Time  The server geovanni still had the nerve to ask if we ready to pay...overall don't come here unless you wanna wait a long time to be served. Manager on duty seem he didn't care for the complaint on there service and his server geovanni. Go else where!!! I'll rate this zero stars if I have to.",

But there are boba places all over this area, so that's convenient.   Whatever nigiri you order, you will always get small amount of rice and a long, thick piece of fish. It's cold and fresh. You'll never get their type of portion elsewhere. I've tried different sushi places (some out of state) and none are like Neko! One thing I dislike is how limited their desserts are. You can only choose ONE out of the choices :( It used to not be like that, but they recently changed it. Hoping it will change back!   The service here is mediocre. It really depends who you get, but the majority of them are very kind and patient. There was only one horrible server, but I think she got fired. Most of the days I come, they aren't busy at all so the food comes out fairly quick.   This is my go to sushi place!",

OLD:  Service was GREAT. Everyone was friendly. They dealt with our shinanegans of 40 orders of yellowtail right off the bat. In all honesty, great service.  Food was great as well. Flavors were on point, freshness was on point. While the fish was good, the temperature of the rice was a little closer to the fish for my taste. Don't let that stop you though. The size of the dwarfs the rice. This is excellent for any fish lovers.  My only gripe, which prevented the me from putting 4 stars, was there was a bone in my yellowtail. While everything else was great, removing bones is an essential skill to have. Will update when I go again.  Overall: great stuff guys. Eat here.",

They have tons of HD TV's and has a multi level seating area! Like I said very very cool place to be! Very Hip!  The prices for AYCE is similar to the rest and they have a great house menu if your not into AYCE!  The staff is super nice! They are always around checking up on you to make sure your drinks are filled and your orders are in!  The AYCE menu to amazing! There were rolls that I have never had before! My all time favorite is the King of Lobster roll! Make sure you try that! Also try the bacon wrapped scallop skewers! Those were a delight.  The sushi chefs are quick! So you don't have to wait long to get your food! This I extremely liked!  They have drinks specials so definitely ask what they are if your looking to have a fun time with friends!",

I've never NEVER had AYCE sushi like this place before. The wifey and I had went on a Saturday, around 4pm, and we were instantly welcomed by the employees. The environment was clean, cozy, and the set up was pretty nice! The server was constantly checking up on us and one lady was always checking if our water needed refilling.  The quality of the sushi was so perfect. Everything tasted so great. My seafood salad was chunks of fish, and even had shrimp tempura pieces in it (which was a nice touch for texture as well).  We finished with coffee mochi (hers), and tempura (vanilla) ice cream! You get one choice for dessert and there were plenty to choose from.  Upon exiting, every server said their thank you's and goodbye's.  We'll definitely continue going here, we love Sushi Neko!",

My friend's beer wasn't cold, and we had to keep asking for water refills. I guess this place is a hit or miss.",

Its in the previous location of shuseki. Once I walked up to the door, the server/host opened the door for me. I was the only table there.  The server was friendly and attentive but not overly so that it was annoying. He was knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations.  The food came out fresh and in a timely manor. None of our orders were forgotten and needed no reminders.  For the nigiri, they didn't give you a lot of rice which is great! I hate places that try to fill you up with rice and give you no fish. The rolls were tasty and nicely portioned and had a good balance of flavors.  The sushi chef was awesome! He's very energetic and friendly and so adorable. He came up to talk to us and was very interested in our opinions. There wasn't a screaming orgasm on the menu but the chef specially made one for us.  It has been one of the better if not best service I have received at a AYCE restaurant thus far. Of course I was the only table so the real challenge comes when there is a full house. I'm expecting great things though! Good luck NEKO!",

We sat there for 8 minutes waiting to be acknowledged. Then we moved to the sushi bar. Somehow they managed to ignore us there as well. After another 8 minutes of trying to get a menu I gave up.

    "text": "Sushi Neko has a rather generous 4.5 star review on Yelp at the moment but after trying it out, I didn't felt like I received service worth even 4 stars.   I went with a small group of friends out to all you can eat sushi dinner here after seeing its advertisement in the plaza with Kung Fu Tea and Raku so we decided to give it a try. I'll admit the best thing about Sushi Neko is the indeed the liberal ratio of fish to rice. Reminds me of Sake 2 Me Sushi in Tustin, CA, and it did taste rather fresh. Some nigiri such as the paprika salmon were good, and a lot of dishes looked like they tried to make the food presentation for the rolls somewhat unique and not completely standard cookie cutter fare I always see at sushi restaurants.  The first 6 or so dishes we ordered came out impressively fast. However, for some reason after that our dishes suddenly stopped coming. We told our waiter (even different waiters, to be honest) countless times we still had more than half of our order that hadn't came in yet and all they said was that they'd check again or something along the lines, but nothing improved. I think we even saw a couple that came in later than us, had all their plates arrive and they left way before we did. At one point, we gave up and tried to reorder all the missing items again, only to not have any of them out after more than 30 to 40 minutes of waiting. I've had sushi places misplace an order when we had a huge table but this... was kind of ridiculous even for a small party. When a place offers all you can eat sushi, they kind of need to be prepared to dish out their fish in a timely manner not just for certain tables, but for everyone, or they're going to get hungry AND angry patrons. And that's a bad combination.   Giving this place 2 stars because I do think it has potential (and because I've honestly had worse before at other places). But service can be terrible and is not consistently good. Hire more sushi chefs or figure out a more efficient system to make food so customers like us aren't sitting ducks waiting for all our items for almost 3 hours.",

The only thing reminiscent of Shuseki was the seating arrangement. Their menu was simple enough. The vibe was modern. Nothing bad to say about this place, but nothing exceptional either. Their staff was attentive though.",

    "text": "Decided to try this new sushi place in town after seeing few 4.5 star reviews on Yelp. There were only 3 tables occupied when we walked in but since this place has only been opened for roughly a month, I decided to try it out anyway. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. After being a sushi-lover for years, I usually rank a restaurant's fish freshness by ordering salmon nigiri's; the texture of the salmon sushi was rough, it tasted like it was refrigerated for a while, and the color was just off. The rest of the sushi nigiri were okay but they all tasted like they have been refrigerated for a while.   However, I do have to give them props for their cooked appetizers --- they tasted really delicious. Service was okay --- had to get the waitress' attention to refill our cups every single time but she was polite; probably just inexperienced in waiting tables.   Overall, I don't think I will be returning to this place. There are a lot more sushi places in town that offers fresh sushi. Even though their cooked appetizers are a lot tastier than the place I frequent, it is not strong enough of a reason to return just for that purpose.",

They are sister spots though so you can expect almost the same menus from either. Sit at the bar if possible, it's always the best way to go. I recommend the salmon belly, the hulk burrito, and definitely grab their iced green tea. This was my second visit but I'll definitely be back for more.",

Neko had been on my mind for awhile and after seeing how consistent reviews were on an annual basis, it was time to stop all their teasing with me.  As my friends and I entered Neko's lair, we were greeted by this upbeat vibe known as Kpop music. At that moment, we knew we were in the right place.  Thankfully, I made dinner arrangements in advance, because the place was crawling with feasting humans.  Our host was so eager to seat us and take our order, but we had other plans in mind... like drinks for example. A couple shots of Sprite did the trick, thus leading us to the next step, our dinner selection.  They provide you with a piece of paper listing all their entrees and sides available which is very convenient for the consumers and chefs backstage.  Some selections were haste, some were pondered on, but somehow we got through it without a sweat. We began to don our AYCE game faces, and before we knew it, the trays started to flow... fast! Garlic Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Super White, you name the Nigiri, we (most likely) tried it.  Vegas Roll, Snow White Roll, Lobster Roll, we ourselves!... were on a roll. Shrimp Tempura, Calamari, Stuffed Tomatoes, Pork Belly, also known as... perfection. Though, there was one lone surviving plate left on the table... twas named Cajun Tuna.  No one seemed to enjoy Cajun Tuna due to its rubbery cartilage texture. After coming to an understanding with our server, all we could do was watch as they took Cajun away... Fortunately, we were still able to top off with some Mochi Ice Cream. With our toothpicks raised, we proposed a toast to a mercury'full evening.",

The appetizers, nigiri, rolls and dessert were all amazing. It was a little hard to find, as it's tucked in the corner of the plaza, but now that I know where it is, I will definitely be back.",

The everyday 2-for-1 beer special is a winning feature too! That makes this place a great to wind down after work, or the ultimate hangout spot for some young adults.

The waiter was cool and super attentive always answering our question promptly and our glasses were always full.

We kinda order a lot of things, everything came pretty fast and the fish was fresh and the quality outstanding for an ayce place.

This went on for the rest of the night. We did the AUCE and ordered uni and ama ebi in our first order and then notified near the end of our 3rd order that it was \"sold out?\" I literally saw uni and ama ebi going into other tables that ordered way later than us.......this ticked me off, leading me into writing this review.

The sushi was excellent and the service was superb. The only downsides to the whole thing was the dance/House music playing so loud. It was hard to hear when you're talking to someone across the table from you. I love it if it was a club but not so much in a restaurant setting. The other downside was the amount of time it took to get your food when it started getting busy. I can understand but 30-45 minutes for a sushi roll and 2 oysters? That's just way too slow. Overall we had a good time and it was enjoyable.",

I was recommended this place by one of my coworkers because of their fish ratio & he wasn't wrong. The nigiri, along with the other specialty rolls, surpassed all my expectations. Baked rolls are only four pieces, which is good since they're typically pretty heavy. They also offer a peanut butter roll (called the Butterfly) for those who love peanut butter hahah. Sounds weird but it's actually really good.   Not only is the food great, but so is the customer service. My boyfriend & I came in on a Tuesday afternoon & service was extremely prompt. Erving, our server, constantly checked up on us, as well as brought us fresh cups of tea without us asking. It's workers like him that make the experience much more enjoyable.   I would definitely consider this place to be one of my favorites.",

I felt the quality was decent, nothing tasted or smelled off, and the nigiri was yummy!    They have a fairly extensive appetizer list that was NOT fish/seafood related (similar to Jjanga) complete with bulgogi nachos which were THE BOMB (in case you have a person in your group that ain't tryin to eat dead, raw fish)!    If I'm honest, I would say I didn't notice a *huge* difference between this place and Jjanga, with the exception of some specialty rolls (one of them has peanut butter in it...I was not a fan but it was not disgusting..just super..eh..peanut buttery(?), so therefore it provided what it advertised..haha)  Another great thing is they have a 2-for-1 drink special (beer, saki)!    I would certainly go again, especially if I'm not feeling like gorging myself since the price point makes it easier to not feel \"obligated\" to \"get my moneys worth\".",

All-you-can-eat sushi at a great price ($20-25) with an amazing selection of sushi and other dishes (Japanese and Korean/American/Fusion style take on Japanese), great service, and pleasant decor. What's weird is that they give you more fish and less rice than \"normal\" sushi places which charge per piece, kind of the opposite of what I was expecting.  They do have a lot of fried/baked options, which tend to be more filling, but there's sashimi, traditional nigiri and maki, and lots of other great stuff.  I didn't feel obligated to totally maximize value by eating more than I wanted to, but I got about 10 dishes of various types, all excellent, and was completely satisfied.  Probably the third best sushi I've had in Las Vegas, and the two better places (across the street) are 4-10x the price.    I'll definitely go back, and encourage others to try Sushi Neko.",

I love their nigiri because they serve it with very little rice. Rolls were amazing too, my favorite is the Shrimp Lovers roll and the Lobster King. Try their pork belly, it is so good!   Price is average for a Las Vegas AYCE place.   The staff was friendly and the dinner service is great, always fast and attentive. My girlfriend and I were very impressed by the quality of service that we received at Neko.   I will say, their dinner celebrations can be a bit loud and annoying. When we went, I think there were 5 birthdays that the staff had to sing to. They turn off the lights and play incredibly loud birthday music. It kinda forces everyone to watch. It might be a good place to embarrass your friend when it's their birthday lol",

The service was great; not overly attentive but made sure our drinks were full and orders were taken when we were ready to try something else The food was made quickly and tasted fresh and yummy. They have a huge assortment of rolls and appetizers to choose from so everyone is sure to find something they like. The sushi had a large amount of fish on it so we really felt like we were getting our money's worth.  Another bonus to this place is, all beer and wine is buy one get one free all day!

Um, can you be more specific? Why is it the best?   \"It just is.\"  We were greeted by a super sweet server who was clearly working solo. The restaurant was full, and she seemed slightly overwhelmed. I say this, not because she was frazzled, but because she walked up to us after she has seated us with water and told us she would seat us in a moment. We smiled, she giggled, apologized, and then took our order.   I wasn't too hungry, so the all you can eat option didn't pull me in. I went rogue and ordered a few salmon and scallop nigiri. My dining buddy went for it and ate more salmon nigiri than I have ever seen consumed in one sitting. He was very methodical in his ordering, making sure to get his money's worth. I threw a roll onto my order for good measure, something with fried shrimp, and salmon belly for dessert.   Next time, I'd avoid the scallop nigiri. It came rolled, which I wasn't used to, and it was quite chewy. Not a fan. The rest of my order was very pleasant and left me feeling very satisfied.   As a skeptic of all you can eat sushi spots, I loved Neko. I'd hang out there for the decor alone. My next trip will include a photo shoot under the wooden tree. Who's in?",

    "text": "Heard so many good things about this restaurant, but I'm so disappointed. I still don't understand why so many people rave about this place.   After knowing that this is the sister restaurant of SAKANA (one of my fav place to get all you can eat sushi), I had high hope for it. Their service was good, and the fish potion is decent on the sushi. However, the reason I gave it a 2 stars was because all of their sushi rice had a overpowering sweet flavor (sauce) to it. All I can taste was the sweetness from the rice. I won't say this was the worst sushi I've ever tried, but overall, I tasted nothing but sweet rice. No Thanks.  I'm so shocked to find out that most of my friends love the sushi here. Maybe it's just my problem? But it's obvious that sushi neko isn't my cup of tea.",

The food came out so fast that it questions me how they prep their food.. I can tell it is not freshly cut every time it is ordered. I spent $40 to eat here (including Sake and tip). Not too bad for sushi right? But if I have to spend $30 for doctors check up and another $30 for my medications.. with a total of $100 spent, I would rather go to Kabuto and spend $100 for a great meal and a great health. It ruined my trip to Texas few days after for a family reunion.  The service was okay too. My server.. he forgot couple of my orders and I had to remind him of my orders. I'm a server myself who work at a sushi restaurant. (Not AYCE) and I completely understand few mistakes but the restaurant wasn't even busy..  Overall, I am NEVER coming back to this place.",

I had the all you can eat lunch special and man it hit the spot. I could not stop ordering it was so good. The ladies that were serving us didn't give us a hard time about ordering a lot of food. They would just check up on us here and there. Very nice waitresses and very helpful with suggesting their popular items on the menu. The dessert was also delicious. We ordered the fried icecream, a popular item, to finish off our meal. This is a clean restaurant on the bottom floor right next to yosi vapes. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you.",

It has been a couple months since i've returned and when I did, the service was not up to par... but the MOST important part about my experience was the quality of the fish i ordered. I have ordered masago with quail egg, the types of salmon and tuna they offer. The first round was alright, but when we ordered the second and third round of fish it became discolored and tasted a little sour which ended up giving me a stomach ache. I just dont understand how the consistency disappeared after the first round?! I honestly use to call this one of my favorite AYCE sushi places and sadly I will never return again. Especially after the last round of masago with quail egg, it literally tasted disgustingly sour. How disappointing, thanks for nothing this time around :/",

Amazing service, super fast, DELICIOUS food. All six of us got the all you can eat so we ordered a ton of different rolls and random stuff from the menu and being someone who wants to try everyone's food, trust me when I say every single thing I tried was AMAZING. I highly recommend the nigiri, it was super fresh and melted in your mouth. The Vegas roll and baked lobster roll was really good too for peeps who aren't down with nigiri too much. Their pork belly was yummy too. Also had soju for the first time and loved it!! Plus they have a buy one get one free alcohol deal all day every day so that was pretty awesome and we took advantage of that. I wish I could remember the names of our servers and hostesses because they all deserve a raise because their customer service was so on point!! Plus they sang happy birthday to my coworker and all of our dessert was super good. Love this place, it's about to be my new fave too!!",

The ratio of rice to fish is really good too unlike most places who like to give more rice. I believe it was around for $27 which is normal for AYCE sushi in the city.

Had a calming atmosphere plus some cute decorations around the restaurant itself and the music that was playing. The waitress was friendly and handled everything we needed. I recently went to the place to celebrate my birthday, and it did not disappoint my eating experience at all, even with the candle they put on the tempura ice cream as a cake, haha (if you wanted their real birthday cake, you have to have your ID)! I'd definitely go here again when I get the chance!",

    "text": "You know you go to a place pretty often when you know the servers' names and you get greeted with a \"welcome back\" every time you come in lol. Before I moved to Vegas, one of my friends told me I HAD to try Sushi Neko. I don't know why it took me almost a month before I tried it, but I literally haven't gone to any other sushi joint since Sushi Neko blessed my life. Sushi Neko is the BEST all you can eat sushi place in Vegas, hands down. All the AYCE sushi places here have pretty similar menus, but the fish to rice ratio here is UNPARALLELED. Don't waste your stomach space on sushi rolls that just taste like eel sauce and mayonnaise or deep fried gyoza like an uncultured swine. Maximize your $$$ and GET. THAT. NIGIRI. The way they prepare nigiri is basically a slab of fish + 10 grains of rice. The quality of the fish is PHENOMENAL. Obviously, you don't go to an AYCE place expecting omakase-quality fish, but for AYCE, it's pretty damn near perfect at Neko. At other sushi places, ordering uni is hit or miss because one day it could be the umami of your dreams and another day it could taste like Poseidon's farts, but the uni at Neko has always been fresh. Pro tip: invite a bunch of people to go with you who aren't keen on uni and eat all their uni.   Their appetizers are really good too. Favorite apps: pang (bread + salmon + mayo sauce + cheesy goodness baked to perfection), agedashi tofu, pork belly (smokey and melt-in-your-mouth delicious). For you egg-lovers, you can ask them to put a quail egg on your ikura/tobiko/masago pieces. If you just order quail egg it's literally just rice, seaweed, and a quail egg lol. For dessert, the green tea panna cotta is actually really tasty despite looking kind of weird. We've had their honey toast and fried banana as well, but green tea panna cotta is #1.  As far as service is concerned, they do their best. They get slammed and sometimes the food takes a while, but it's always worth it. Try going on a weekday to avoid the weekend rush and if you're coming in with a party, they won't give you a table until everyone is there. This review is all over the place because I just can't say enough good things about Sushi Neko. It's seriously the best.",

    "text": "MY FAVORITE AYCE SUSHI SPOT!!!  And yours too if you prioritize: -Fresh fish on nigiri -4:1 fish to rice ratio on nigiri -Salmon belly availability  -flaky and light tempura consistency -wide variety of appetizers and sushi options  If you're looking for a place that serves the best ROLLS specifically, I would try Jjanga or Yama Sushi. They put too much rice on the rolls at Sushi Neko so it ends up not being that great. But at other places, the rolls all have different flavors and they're smaller (sometimes you can get half rolls!!!) so you can try a lot of different ones.  But I'm definitely a nigiri person, so I love it here. All of the nigiri I tried was great! With the exception of the scallop... I love raw hotate (scallop) but the one here comes out cooked and with this weird Cajun powder on it. Bummer.  Standouts? Salmon belly, salmon, escolar, yuzu yellowtail nigiri. Baked lobster roll.  Biggest surprise? Bulgogi Nachos. Pleasantly delicious.  Oh btw, they have deep fried eel.  You won't regret it if you come here as long as you don't order like 6 rolls to start. Haha.   I forgot to take pictures because the food was so good!!! That's saying something.",

If you're a salmon lover like me, I would suggest getting the salmon belly. They only do one order per person, but it's worth!   I would also try their appetizers like: pork belly, bacon and scallop skewer, or KFC (Korean fried chicken)! It's not for everyone, but they're worth a try since their included for the AYCE.   When it comes to dessert, I always order their affogato (coffee with ice cream)! The coffee and ice cream just work so well together. It's a perfect way to end the meal!  The restaurant has its busy moments where there's possibly a point where you'll be waiting to be seated, especially if you have a big party, or if you come on a Saturday night. Other than that, the service is all around pretty good, and the food is great!",

I am usually patient but when it was already 55 minutes and I went to check on my name, the host had skipped my party when I had already checked on my name and told the guy who I was. Yet I have no idea how my name got skipped when I was waiting right in front of him. Anyways, that was the worst part. When seated at the table, the same server from last visit came to my table. Not a simple smile or hello. First thing she says was \"what do you want?\" Then when I was ordering my food she stopped me and said \"that's enough!\" And just left. RUDE!!!!!! She has no personality and when talking to her she kept looking around as well. Why are you a server when you have no customer service skills! You guys really need to reconsider or retrain these employees! I brought my friend here for the first time, in hopes they would have a good experience. Even they told me they would NEVER come back due to the horrible service.",

Their fish to rice ratio is great!!  The Ayce value is also great because of the variety of sides/appetizers/sushi. Compared to other Vegas AYCE spots, Sushi Neko has unique sides other than your typical edamame or shrimp tempura found anywhere else.  NOT RECOMMENDED: their uni (sour & not fresh), pork belly, tobiko (over wasabi'd)  At my most recent visit, there was a 45 minute wait. They do take reservations apparently. So recommended if you have a larger party than 5.   Will continue to go back whenever I'm in town for an Ayce sushi fix.",

They were busy, but still had a few empty tables. We ordered our first round of food with the waitress and everything look like it was going great. Sushi tasted great, but we were missing our roll, which was the only roll we ordered. It took 3x of telling the waitress to finally get a simple salmon skin roll. We waited to make a 2nd order, but we didn't seem to be able to flag down anyone. When we finally got to the make another order, we were missing a few items on this order as well. After a while, we just got tired of waiting for orders that seemed like it was never going to come. We ordered our dessert and again, only one of our desserts came. I was just done at this point and got up to pay.  If only the service was good, I would of given them 5 stars since the sushi was delicious, but sushi joints are dime a dozen here in Vegas. I can find other sushi places equally as delicious with better service.",

If you're looking for a sushi spot that puts a LOT of meat on their rolls and nigiri, this is the one! Their fish is always fresh tasting, and if you need minor alterations they'll do it. I like that when I eat here vs Kaya, I'm not just sitting there waiting for someone to come by and take my order. They have fast service here.   Atmosphere is good, there's big tv screens all around playing K-pop videos. Restaurant is always as clean as it can be given how busy it is.

If you go try to make it before 4pm it's only around $20 Per person for lunch time! Which is the best deal because unless you love uni (Sea urchin) dinner is not much difference on menu for almost $10more. Most all you can eat places are becoming trash in Las Vegas. But I still think sushi neko is decent if you want a cheap decent sushi meal. Try the Chanel roll if you like rolls!",

    "text": "Great sushi option in Las Vegas. They have AYCE, but also have a la carte. For a family like mine where one kid doesn't like sushi it helps to have a la carte options that he can choose from instead of AYCE sushi.  Their sushi options are wide and varied. You place your order and they bring the food to you; It's not a buffet.  The best part is that their nigiri doesn't come with a big chunk of rice to fill you up. The fish is fresh each time we've been here. Their Korean chicken is really flavorful, but on the small side so order a few to share at the table.  I also love that if you come around 11 to noon, there is no wait. I highly recommend this place.",

This location is amazing due to the fact there is never a wait.   Definitely get the yuzu yellowtail, lemon salmon, garlic tuna, and snapper (nigiri wise). The rolls tend to mostly be fried or baked with the exception of the hand rolls (Hulk and Batman are the best, crunchy and fresh!!!!!).   Alsooooo the fact they have an affogaro topped with Frosted Flakes is literally too good for this world.",

No time limit and no slowing down of service or people making you feel like you should leave. It's amazing!   DRINKS: are all refillable. They extra but so reasonable. Soda is $1.50 but unlimited. It comes in a can so you always know it's fresh and bubbly! The hot tea is also very good.  FOOD: Such an extensive menu. Well over 100 items maybe even 200! I've never seen so many types of rolls. They have something for everyone. For raw fish lovers, to roll lovers, to only cooked seafood lovers to, non seafood eaters. They have a ton of unique and tasty appetizers like Korean fried chicken, sweet toast with baked salmon and cheese, and pork belly.  They are generous with their raw fish portions.   SERVICE: excellent!!! Wow the service here may just be one of the best I've experienced and I've been to a lot of places. Quick, friendly, bring out food fast, always replenishing drinks and clearing plates. They always come by it's really amazing I have never seen staff (both waitresses and other staff) work so hard. They really make the experience lovely.  2 hr wait on weekends!",

Their $29.99 for their AYCE is mostly True, but a few items they do limit one order per customer.  Although they're not shy about their portion, the problem is their fish quality are so-so. Their Uni was borderline fresh/trash and almost all their sushi are drowned in some type of red or white sauce or drenched in mayonnaise. In fact, one of the dish it had so much thick sauce that we was able to flip the plate over and the sushi was stuck on the plate like Spider-man. Once you scrape off the sauce you get the True taste of the fish and it wasn't to our liking.   Sushi Neko caters to a certain type of customers, those who like their food drowned in sauces but if you're wanting clean fresh sushi taste, this place may not suit your taste buds.",

Out of all the AYCE sushi spots I've tried so far, Sushi Neko is my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas.   Every time I have family/friends who visit, I either bring them here or recommend this restaurant to them to try it out. Reason being: of course it's AYCE sushi including appetizers, dessert, etc. The nigiri is the best part about the sushi because they cut large, fresh slices of fish with little rice (which I definitely prefer). I absolutely love their cut of salmon, yellowtail, white tuna and mackerel. If you can handle a huge amount of sushi in different varieties then this is the place to be! Their service is also very attentive as well and I always leave his place with a happy tummy :)",

    "text": "Goyemon has long been the go-to, fave AYCE sushi for a hot minute. I thought to check out a different place for a change. I originally thought it was Japanese-owned, until I arrived, I soon realized it was Korean-owned. Now I know it's the same owners of Hwaro.  Though I had my prejudices, this meal turned out way beyond my expectations. Well, not really, cuz I saw the photos of the huge pieces of fish to rice ratio. hehehhehehhe.   Salmon and yellowtail were fresh. Nice large fish pieces in comparison to rice ratio. Unagi was really good, way better than Goyemon IMHO. Other appetizer items like \"The shit,\" \"KFC chicken,\" baked mussels, and the rice-less sushi rolls were all delicious. My conclusion is that this place hands down has legit appetizers, and their nigiri's are legit as well for an AYCE. IT's a definite bang for your buck.   The only two things that I'd say were a bummer are:   1) No refills on soda. You buy and pay by the can.  2) No fried shrimp heads (amaebi) available on menu. I also don't think they had any rolls using spam, but I might be wrong.   There was no wait on a weekday around 6:00p.m. and hardly any customers. Hence, service was quick and efficient. If it gets crowded, service might be compromised.   A definite must-try in town, and I hope they continue to keep their standard and quality as is for a long time. PLEASE don't start skimping on the size of the fish pieces after a year so that I can keep coming back! :)  Overall food to ambiance to service for the value combined, I give 5 stars in the AYCE sushi department.",

    "text": "Maybe I just came on the wrong day but all of the 5 star reviews have me confused! We were a party of 4 and did AYCE. We ordered a good amount of nigiri, sashimi and a couple rolls upfront and I kid you not, we maybe got ONE thing from our order every 10+ minutes. So we'd all get one piece and then the waiting game continued.  An entire hour passed and we still hadn't gotten any of the nigiri from our FIRST ORDER. They brought us two things we had already received and at the end they charged us for 5 people instead of 4.   lol.  I didn't know whether to be infuriated or laugh because our experience was THAT bad. Sure, the sushi was alright, but there are better places to go that actually bring you the things you order in a timely manner (aka what you would want if you're paying for AYCE). Don't recommend and won't be back.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite goto sushi spot, but after numerous visits that resulted in a \"hit or miss\",  it's sad to say I do not think I will be back to try my luck. I've suggested this sushi spot to many of my friends, in addition to bringing in a party of 12 people for a birthday at one point, because I highly recommended this place. However, within a span of a year, I have seen a decline in service and food quality.  Last night, my boyfriend and I went in to take our chances and hopefully leave satisfied. Sad to say, the experience was subpar and left us with the ultimate decision on not planning to return. Ordered the seafood salad, and the cuts of fish was so sloppy, I was almost mistaken that it wasn't the dish I had ordered. I've had this dish in the past, but this time it was the most unappealing and questionable. Next, we ordered our usual of garlic tuna nigiri..they were thinly sliced, and soft, which was nice, but tell me why the chef decided to throw an \"extra scrap\" of meat on top of one of the nigiris? Even if this was a mistake, not sure why the server would still decide to serve it to us that way...Strange, but okay. Overall, through our numerous attempts at visiting Neko, we noticed that the sushi quality has gone downhill..we will mainly eat nigiri, and will immediately be able to tell the difference of how the chef cuts the fish. sometimes the nigiri is extremely soft and thin cut, with little rice, then you have other times the fish is cut so thick, or with hard parts of the fish, with a larger amount of rice, which make it mediocre. The food just seems to be very inconsistent, and is not worth taking the chance for anymore. Sorry Neko, it was nice gambling with you!",

My friend and I decided to try this place out on Christmas night and I dont know if this place is just the best in vegas, but I can go to much better places w better service and quality and taste somewhere else.   The sushi quality was alright. There was also many diversities which I think is a plus, but the amount of rice balls in each sushi differed for each sushi and the shape and thickness of fish for sushi was never consistent.   Service, it wasnt as bad to be offensive, but I think they could do better. They seemed like they were hating their job and wasnt wanting to be there. Also, the way they take order, I felt that they could find much better way to take the order because it was so confusing for both servers and customers. Also, they never stated what order I was getting when they were serving food, so I think they could do better job on that.   Taste wise, I thought was alright, but there are other ayce sushi places that could do better. I liked the small portionof appetizer they served w, bc I was able to try different things out.   Overall, I would not go back just because there's better places w similar pricings. Was very dissappointed.",

    "text": "It's been ages since I've tried a new all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. Even though it's the younger sister of Sakana, I'm sure this counts.  I've gone without my favorite type of indulgence for a few months, so I eagerly made my way to Sushi Neko. It's at the inner corner of the first floor of the small two-story mall on Spring Mountain that's also home to SF Supermarket, Bazic, and Swish. The parking lot is rather cramped, but I lucked out by finding a spot before having to resort to the garage.  Although I arrived shortly before 4pm, I requested the dinner AYCE anyway at the price of $25.95 (lunch is $20.95). The table seating in what I'm told is the former location of Shuseki is fairly spacious, but as as a solo diner (for perhaps the first time in my Vegas AYCE sushi dining career), I opted for a bar seat for easy ordering.  Appetizer orders actually go through the server, which is a common practice as far as I've seen. I usually order my fair share of apps, and this time didn't differ:  - Pork belly: two huge pieces of meaty (not so much fatty) pork in a sweet sauce. It's among the better AYCE sushi orders, but I'd recommend sharing.  - Baked mussels: with four mussels, it's another app that should be shared. I couldn't resist though, and they were definitely nice. The creamy sauce isn't overpowering.  - Salmon kama (instead of the unavailable hamachi kama): a relatively modest portion, at last. Tender and moist throughout, but a little underseasoned. I'm glad that soy sauce was within reach.  - Pang: some sort of mixture of salmon, surimi, and cheese baked top of tiny garlic bread crostini. I've not seen an appetizer with bread before on an AYCE sushi menu, so it was a nice change of pace.  - Dynamite: with mushroom and I believe shellfish under the creamy sauce, and red onion strings, this is a lighter-than-average version of this appetizer that I loved. It's served on a large shell that you can just pick up by hand (after it cools down anyway).  The real heart of the meal was the nigiri, of course. It began when I requested the blackboard specials of the sushi chef and he presented a nice plate of goodies. The salmon belly was garnished with fresh wasabi and as delicious as any salmon belly nigiri that I've had. The aji (horse mackerel), kanpachi (garnished with shoyu nori), and striped bass (with a cajun-like garnish) were as good as any that I've had in an AYCE setting.  The sushi chef followed that up with a small plate of his own choosing, after inquiring as to whether I'd had mackerel (of course yes). The mackerel was definitely among the better mackerel nigiri that I've tried, although it doesn't match the salty lusciousness of a now-defunct AYCE sashimi menu that I once enjoyed. The smoked paprika salmon was an interesting variant that didn't quite satisfy as much as the salmon belly. The yuzu yellowtail belly was a very nice closer that wasn't too citrus-y.  I proceeded afterward with several nigiri orders of my own volition. The ocean trout (one-per-person) was fantastic, but troubles ensued afterward. The oyster (also 1pp, and one piece at that) was actually not nigiri, and it was decent. The ama ebi (1pp, 1 pc.) wasn't nigiri either, and while the deep-fried head was fine, the body and tail were a little too mushy. The uni was a letdown, with one piece reeking somewhat of dirty seawater and the other one just boring.  And then the biggest issue was the seemingly not-fresh salmon. It lacked flavor and was a little mushy. This was compounded by the oversized fish-to-rice presentation, which is counterproductive if you're actually struggling to swallow the fish. I'm sure it's a fluke, but I wasn't happy.  The super white (with screaming orgasm sauce) wasn't that impressive either. The scallop was fine though (and not of the deplorable bay scallop variety), and the unagi was a high note to end the meal.  Also ordered and eaten around the conclusion was my only foray into the \"rolls\" side of their menu. It was actually a riceless Towering Sashimi that could very well be called mini-tostadas, and the combination of unusually thin crunchy wonton squares, various raw fish, red onion, and sweet and spicy sauces dazzled my palate even though the fullness factor was dulling my taste buds.  Finally, dessert time. I was saddened to see that I only was able to pick one dessert (aside from ice cream scoops), a deplorable policy which Yelpers report that Sakana has also now implemented. I settled on the coffee blanc mange, which had reasonable coffee flavor and a decent smooth texture aside from an unusual top skin that should not be there. Thankfully, the plum ice cream lived up to my memories of the fragrant, smooth dessert of Sakana.  I've heard of other similar places on Spring Mountain, but Sushi Neko is really laying claim to the niche. Their peaks were memorable, but it's not going to be a frequent revisit for me due to various flaws and issues. But do try it once if you're a Sakana or AYCE fan.",

Orders came out fairly quickly, and staff always came by to see if we're doing okay or needed to order more. I would say coming here for nigiri is great! The rolls are okay to me, many of which have quite a bit of yumyum sauce or rice, then again I'm not too crazy about rolls themselves. The appetizers they have are delicious, the skewers and pork belly are a must in my opinion. Last but not least, the decor! As if the Internet world didn't already love cats! Cat or neko decorations and pictures have graced the walls everywhere in here. Very cute and tasteful, but if cats aren't your thing that's okay  the other elements of Japanese assortments and of course sushi is well worth a visit.",

It's a hidden nook downstairs from Cafe Teaze, cozy with cat decor and art everywhere- trinkets on shelves on the walls, photos at the bar, and even drawn on the menu!  Menu has a huge selection of apps, nigiri, and rolls, broken down into specialty, baked, fried, hand, and riceless rolls. Their selection of riceless rolls is on par with Jjanga (~5 choices), and they are well executed. As others have said, nigiri is fresh and generously cut, and rice is proportionate. They also have a selection of grilled skewers (haven't tried 'em), and desserts are limited to 1/person- but many are made in house and higher quality than elsewhere.  I was so pleased with my first meal here that I literally came back within a week. Same great product and experience.  Both visits, I sat at the bar- sushi chefs are friendly and engaging instead of silent and stoic, as elsewhere. Dinner price ($28?) is reasonable considering the selection and quality. Definitely a place I am happy to be a regular.",

    "text": "So we actually went to a different sushi place down the street first, but after the first roll came out a huge power outage happened for the whole block meaning they had to close the doors for the day.   After looking at reviews online, we decided to try this place out. I wasn't expecting much this time around since I consider the other place my favorite in town and was still disappointed about it closing, but I was so shocked!!!   All you can eat for 20 during lunch and 25 for dinner. Standard price. We got sat immediately so that was nice. It's a bigger sushi place in the plaza directly across from monta ramen. It's pretty spacious. I'm used to bumping into every table to get to the bathroom! The parking lot has a lot of open space so it's easy to find parking. Neko means cat in Japanese, so it's obvious that the menu and designs have cats all over the restaurant.   They do serve beer here. $6 for two sapporos? That's pretty awesome! We got about 12 different rolls between the 4 of us. It's safe to say that I found my new favorite sushi spot. There was not one roll that was \"just okay.\" Every single one was so delicious! I'm used to only a few being this flavorful but this place seems to have it all. My favorite was their Japanese lasagna and their be sexy tonight one!! We liked them so much we had to order them twice! I love my Ass and captain America are also very delicious. We also got The Who's your daddy roll and I can't remember the rest on the top of my head.   Great service, amazing food. You can't miss! I really can't wait to come back soon!",

The waiters also since and dance if you ask them and the chefs can imitate things like fish and octopus that live in the sea if you ask nicely too.  I drive 45 minutes each time too eat here it's so good. Very consistent taste on the food no matter when you eat here.",

The spicy garlic edamame is delicious! As well as the salmon belly nigiri. It was first time trying it and I loved it! They also have your regular classic rolls like caterpillar and Philadelphia. Overall it was a good first experience. I'll definitely be back to eat here with my friends and family!",

The fish to rice ratio unbeatable (unless you prefer small cuts of sushi and tons of rice, who could ever complain about the cuts of fish being to big and not enough rice unless your a few French fries short of a happy meal)... They have salmon belly on the AYCE, like butter, only thing I tasted that might have just had an off day was the super white tuna, a little on the mushy side, but ill overlook that as the rest of the food was just incredible again as far as AYCE sushi places go in Vegas... A little on the noisy side with the music is the only thing I would gripe about....Great Job guys, also very friendly comes out fast, do not hassle you on time limits just a great overall meal, coming from someone that pretty critical of food.. I sure hope I go back again and its the same experience again, so hard to find places that are consistent these days, if not ill be back to tell you guys... :)",

Their white tuna with light sauce is freakin amazing. It melts in your mouth. The lobster roll is bomb. Their bacon and scallop skewers are delicious. Their shrimp tempura is hot and crunchy. So many choices, u might get a little overwhelmed. Lol their oysters have this really good sauce to it on top that makes it amazing. Plus they have specials everyday on the board that you can ask for when u do AYCE. I tried their tako wasabi. Interestingly good. I wouldn't suggest getting any of the fried rolls. Their too filling. And you cant freakin beat buy one sake bottle get one free! They have a lychee one that's bomb. For dessert, I always go for the typical green tea cause you can't go wrong with that. But they do have like a tiramisu and mini toast as options I believe. The staff is really nice too.",

At that moment i really like experience how the restaurant do that to b-day costumer, in my head thinking that i will come back here for dinner and celebrate b-day. Today we came back here and is my girl b-day, almost at the end servers come and ask us for desert, so we pick a mini cake b-day it only give out to b-day person only!! Server ask to see ID to make sure is really my girl b-day, so we all excited and waiting for mini cake with candle to sing a happy b-day song. Server walk to our table with mini cake and said \" here is your desert \" with out a candle and walk away immediately. What is the point of asking for ID??? What server bring us look like ice cream with whip cream on top, it that what they call a mini cake????  So i walk to cashier ask do you do anything for b-day?? He said yes we bring out mini cake with candle and sing happy b-day. Server listen to what ask the cashier and bring out a candle and ask \" do we want her to light the candle\" ?? And walk away. Today is really bad b-day experience for us. Thank you..",

Just a lot of miscommunication, I suppose or something happened to cause us not to everything we order. We felt bad for the servers because they wouldn't know what happened to our orders. I mean we were missing a lot of orders. But it's okay. It was a interesting experience. This guy gave us some cup for all the missing orders which was sweet.

Service is top notch. We even met a guy that had transfered over from sakana. Overall food was top notch as well. The sashimi is fresh. The rolls we didn't order that many as we were there for nigri more.  Most def a place to check out.",

    "text": "I wanted sushi today with a friend and my boyfriend on this lovely day. I went into sushi Neko due to the fact that it was close by. I went in and we all ordered all you can eat. We each ordered water, the water was not only dirty but two glasses were evidently not washed. When the sushi came the sushi was majority fish with minimal rice, making it hard to use chopsticks because the rolls would just fall apart because the nori couldn't seal closed. The deserts were so-so, my honey toast was amazing but my Italian boyfriend who has grown up eating tiramisu said that it was very dry and seemed as if it had been left out for a day or two, my friend had the green tea ice cream which came complete with a piece of blueish plastic in the ice cream.  Our bill was $68. I paid $45 in cash, leaving my friend with a $23 bill which was to be charged to her card. When we received our receipts she had been charged $42 and I was told that I had only put $26 in cash with the check. Originally the busser picked up our check, I do not know if he had stolen the $20 bill before he gave it to the waitress or what happened but somehow my $20 bill disappeared into thin air and my friend was over charged by $20. The host was also rude when seating us, making a comment about us being impatient when I had told my friend that I was so hungry, I was not only not speaking to the host but my comment was meant to portray my excitement about trying this new sushi restaurant to my friend and boyfriend. My boyfriend has also worked as a busser, food runner, server, bartender, and restaurant manager for 6 years, he was very upset with the experience as a whole. The treatment we recieved from the staff was far from acceptable, the food was sub-par, much of if tasting somewhat fishy and not very fresh, the rolls were falling apart, and we waited over ten minutes to receive our water after only two of us were asked what we would have liked. My boyfriend would have preferred a sprite but was never given the opportunity to order and tried twice to get the waitresses attention for long enough to ask but she did not seem concerned with anything other than getting to her next table. Do not come here, go anywhere else in the Las Vegas valley and I guarantee you won't regret not trying this place, you aren't missing out, if anything you are just saving yourself grief and heartache",

There are a couple items on the menu that is dinner only and just one order per person. Everything on the menu is very good.  The only downside to this place is that sometimes the service can be hit or miss. There was one time me and my husband wasn't sat down in order of who came in first and how small our party was. There was a big party that came in after us and got greeted right away and sat down right away. That kind of got us mad. I didn't feel like I was welcomed to this place after we've been coming here for so many times. Once we got sat down, my husband wanted to tell the manager that we weren't expecting top of the line service but just to let them know that some of their servers has been playing favorites with the customers and getting special treatments because the customers are friends with the server. To be honest, I heard the customer/server speaking in Korean.  I was so tempted to speak in Korean so that they knew that understood everything and that I knew what was going on. But I didn't want to cause a scene. So being nice and polite, my husband talked to the manager and told him what had happened. He said he was really sorry that this had to happened to us and that he greatly appreciates our business. The next time we went in to have our dinner, we noticed that that the service was a lot more <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbetter.my&s=645024f3495f50e0e1c05a8073bf2e06cee3fbe9be0f444fc28ce991c3f6dbd3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">better.my</a> husband and I are never the type to complain about anything. If we have to bring something up to a manager we would just politely ask to speak to them and not yell at our server.",

The servers are having a very very hard time getting the orders from chef to table.  Last time i was there food was everywhere.  So many lost orders.  So many of other peoples orders to our table.    If you get to read this mr owner at sushi neko.  Use a table numbering system.  Number the tables.  Whenever someone orders put that number on the order form so when the chef makes it you know which table the food goes to.  Love the business.  The cashier girl is very very beautiful.  Lucky man married her.  Anyways.  Great food.  If this place had better orginization it will easily be the best in las vegas.",

The rolls come out quick and the flavor of the sauces on the sushi is awesome. The nigiri sushi is delicious. I love to order salmon belly or salmon and the white albacore is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>, it's great cause you can wrap the sushi around the rice, it's not like other places where there's barely any fish. The taste of the rice is good in the sushi too. The rolls are always neat and the waiters or waitresses we get always upbeat. I love the decor and the little Japanese movies/anime they have on. My only complaint is that I wish they would open later!!",

Sat in the small room to right as you enter which was a little weird as it seems like there was a wall there before that they just took down the dry wall. Hard to maneuver chairs for those sitting in them that were against some of the 2x4's. I would recommend taking them down if they can. All the food was great. Never got any photos since we scarfed it down as soon as it hit the table. I've been to Sakana a few times & I believe that Sushi Neko is better.",

We came in as a party of four and were immediately seated. The first thing that I noticed about the restaurant was how clean and vibrant it looked. The decor on the walls reflects a Japanese theme (as sushi restaurants generally), but with a pop culture twist.   Our servers Carlos and Hana were very knowledgeable about the menu and explained everything well. They offered great suggestions and followed thru on several of them. We had a smattering of rolls, ranging from the mundane tiger roll to the succulent Chanel roll. My personal favorite was the shit however. I'll let you figure that out on your own.   For 25.95 for dinner, I would definitely come back. Probably even tomorrow. Found a new good place that is excellent.",

However during my last visit, I brought some out-of-town relatives here for dinner and was left embarrassed for talking this place up so much.   Normally, as many other reviewers have mentioned, the rice to fish ratio is great. However, during this visit, I received sushi with double (or more) the regular amount of rice. I'm unsure if this is due to a new chef or new procedures. I guess we'll see?  While it's not noted on the menu, our server told us (rather rudely btw) that each table is limited to 2 orders of kama (collar). Doesn't matter if your table is 2 people or 20. Only 2 per table. So we ordered 2. 30 minutes later, we were informed there was no Kama left. Come to think of it, I don't think they've ever had it in stock when I dined there.   To add some variety, we also wanted to order the tonkatsu on their special menu. Then we were told that they do not make that item anymore. A little disappointing. Anyway, if this is the direction Sushi Neko and all of their sister restaurants are going, then I may need to consider finding a new favorite.",

    "text": "Tell me why this place isn't rated 5 stars!?!   For years, I used to see this super pixilated photo of Sushi Neko and it's location, right in front of Hwaro. Then, while on a search for a new GO-TO sushi spot, this came about!   I love the sushi to rice ratio when it comes to their nigiri. I always rave to my friends and people I don't even know that if you're going to have AYCE sushi, go to Sushi Neko. You get more than your money's worth, the food is fast, the waiters are nice, the fish to rice ratio is almost unbeatable, and everything is also instagram worthy.   I'll know if I'll like any sushi place by their salmon nigiri. Salmon nigiri is such a staple and basic, I believe it's equivalent to judging any boba shop by their milk tea. It's the standard. The salmon is so delicious! No only that, i usually don't order tuna nigiri, but this place offers \"Garlic Tuna Nigiri\" and it has made me fall in love with tuna!   You won't regret coming here, this place just keeps getting more and more popular!",

Our drinks came out quick & we weren't rushed to put in our food orders. We did the All You Can Eat so wanted to make sure we had our order ready to go.  We ordered, among other things, the red snapper, albacore 300, garlic tuna, topiko, lemon salmon roll, Mexican roll, bulgogi nachos & sashimi platter. These were all so good we ordered them multiple times! The highlight was undoubtedly the albacore 300! It came with a jalapeno & hot sauce on top.... Was delicious! Their topiko was amazing as well!   For dessert we had the tempura ice cream, honey toast & mochi... They were all good & we will definitely come back again VERY soon!",

But I liked that they give you a decent piece of fish on a small amount of rice. It was nice cause we were apart of a huge group so they broke up us up into sections rather than trying to take order from the whole group. It made ordering a lot easier.   There were certain items that they limited you to, I highly recommend that you order them. All of those items were so delicious! And they also have a few options that don't have rice. All of those options were good too. They also have other items other than sushi and rolls, like yakitori. We tried some of those items too and they were good.   I would have to say that some of their desserts were not good. The brick toast was very disappointing. It's basically just a Hawaiian roll that they put some honey on and toasted with an ice cream scoop on top. I would say any of the other desserts are better.",

The interior is super cute, artsy and hipster! While all that is good - the food is simply basic...A-OK!  The spicy garlic edamame had a super spicy sauce on top, which wasn't good, it was too spicy with an uncomfortable after taste. We couldn't even finish these.  The green mussels were probably the only thing good here. Juicy, cheesy and very flavorful! I would totally recommend these and order them again.  The KFC, Korean fried chicken was okay. The crispy exterior with a juicy interior these chickens were good.   The baked lobster roll was interesting, while everything g looked good, the weird fishy after taste did not leave a good taste in my mouth. Pass.   I enjoyed the orange salmon, which consisted of sashimi, lemon wedge, and fresh ingredients.   The service was mediocre. At times we waited for someone to take our order and other times we felt rushed when they were finally assisting us. It was a weird vibe.   Would I return?? Probably not. There are other places that offer AYCE... here the cost is $20.99 for AYCE..",

Sushi Neko is kind of hidden in a typical china town plaza off of Spring Mnt road, but pretty spacious on the inside so wait time isn't too bad.    The menu:  extensive than the usual AYCE menu, but what caught our attention is the additional \"off the wall\" apps and dishes.  Make sure to ask the waitress for their recommendations and for their signature dishes... you won't be disappointed.    Finally, the wall art.  Being a long time \"Slam Dunk\" Shojo manga and anime fan, their wall art took me home to my younger nostalgic days of Sakuragi Hanamich and Sendoh basketball days.",

Sushi Neko is also the sister restaurant to Sakana so if that's closer to you they are identical. We usually do the all you can eat and that usually runs us $26 dollars a person for dinner price. The lunch price is cheaper but we usually don't make it for lunch time. If you order sake or beer it'll be more expensive.   The restaurant decor is very casual laidback with music playing. If you're looking for an experience along with a dinner this isn't quite it. They walk up ask if you're ready and they start taking your order. The servers check up on you often and are kind but they move quick so they don't ask too many questions. You don't really get a name or a welcome. It's a fast turnover restaurant so conversing slows the servers down. If you're looking for great quality food bottom line then this is for you! It's lit bright inside and the service is so quick. Seriously a must try if you love seafood.",

Located in a busy mall, it's hard to find and not clearly visible from street.  Have been here multiple times and still could not try everything on the menu.  Being AYCE, they will ask that you eat all that you order including the rice. Among the standouts were yellowtail neck grilled, most of the sushi pieces, grilled skewers (garlic, mushroom were better) and desert (ice cream).  Didn't get the rolls, it's not our thing. Lunch or dinner prices were reasonable, and if you are drinking then prices will go up depending on how much you drink.  Some of what we found to be good about sushi Neko were:  -fresh ingredients, we didn't find anything stale -high quality, even rice that they use is of good quality -interesting food ideas, inventive items abound in the menu -good service, owner and staff keep busy ordering and clearing tables -attractive interior and clean layout  We'll be back.",

In fact, everything is identical to Sakana. The menu and rolls are the same.   There are plenty of parking. The outside parking can get packed but you can utilize the parking garage. It is also bigger than Sakana so there are plenty of seats and better for large groups. Wait times can be a bit long depending what time you come. We came with a group of 4 and waited about 30 mins.   Everything is delicious here. Rolls can me ordered in half, that way u can try a bit of everything. The rice to fish ratio for nigiri is superb. The slices of fish they give u are huge.   We always get yellowtail Hamachi. It's so good! However, they did limit us on how much we can order. We never had that issue at Sakana. Always go for the dinner only (1 per person) such as oysters, uni, salmon belly, etc.   Overall, I would come here again. Service was great. You also get a free drink wither soda or Hite beer of you check in through yelp.",

From the time we walked in the door to getting seated right away (on a Saturday night) to getting stuffed off all the sushi, this place is legit. It was a busy Saturday night, when me and my boyfriend walked in I was prepared to sign my name on the clipboard for the waiting list as I see a couple parties waiting to get seated. But one of the workers immediately sat us down at the table before I was able to sign my name, so awesome!  The interior design is super cute, you almost forget you're in Vegas. We had multiple servers, which was great because we knew we weren't being forgotten about among all the huge parties inside.   The fish here is really fresh and you can really tell the difference from other AYCE sushi places in town. The fish to rice ratio is 2:1 since the fish is literally double the size of the rice. The rice is also really fresh and was always warm so I knew it was fresh and not left in the fridge overnight. Everything we ordered tasted amazinggggg. My favorites are the nigiri pieces, the fish was fresh and left me wanting more.   The service here was excellent, our waters were always being refilled and tables cleared of empty plates. Yes I recommend this place for AYCE sushi && yes I will definitely be back!",

But, I had high expectations and it did really exceed those expectations. I believe the amount of food you order and the quality of what you are getting at Sushi Neko is worth it. .. First, the ambiance of the restaurant was quite nice, and the decor is very artistic and creative. Also, you can hear KPOP music playing in the background with their huge screens around the restaurant.  Second, the service is perfect! The server was generous. He came by the table to check on us; from making sure if we wanted more food to pouring our empty water cups.  Lastly, I wasn't really into eating the fried sushi/rolls, but the fish quality was fresh and delicious. I liked [preference] they didn't not put much rice with the [nigiri sushi] fish. But, I will definitely come back again! This is the perfect to-go sushi place in Vegas that I would recommend.",

Once seated, we received impeccable service and prompt food delivery. They allow half rolls. You may order more than one dessert.    A couple of times we received food that we had not ordered. But it was quickly rectified each time.  Sushi Neko is a must try for visitors and natives alike !    Prices:5/5 Service:5/5 Ambience: 5/5",

    "text": "Wow!  Went to Vegas on a recent trip and had all you can eat sushi at this restaurant.  Incredibly good and had such a huge selection. Almost 80 different items you can choose from. I was really impressed with the appetizers and the selection of desserts.   The sushi was really delicious and not a lot of rice.  Nigiri was cut beautifully and tasty!  I loved the Korean affogato as an apres meal dessert.  We went at lunch time and the line was not bad, but if you go in the evening, it will be a long wait since this is a popular sushi spot in Vegas and for good reason.",

One thing that I have to say is that the server seemed irritated when taking our order. Maybe it was because it was busy, but that kind of discouraged us to order. She took our order twice in the time that we were there.   Keep in mind that some of the rolls are pre-made (per our server) and if you have an allergy they will not make you another one; you'll have to order something that doesn't contain what you are allergic too.   We would probably come back, just because the food is great!!",

We ordered a lot of the no rice rolls and plenty of appetizers. My favorite was the sashimi roll and the sushi tower. I love all the skewers you can get and Ofcourse we had to have 5 orders of the baked mussels. We ate so much and everything was tasty and service was friendly! I will continue to return to this sushi place over and over. We had to finish with the AFFOGATO! So yummy,espresso,ice cream and topped with Frosted Flakes. The inside of this restaurant is very colorful and pretty you will definitely love eating here.",

I would give it a chance once you come in.  First of, it's a buffet.  Choose wisely because the food comes in generous sizes not very small at all.  Don't over order unless you have been lost in the desert and failed at doing some Man VS Wild survivalist tricks.  This place will fulfill all your sushi dreams with their huge menu.  The price is very cheap as well considering all your options.  Only some stuff do not come with AYCE but everything else is fair game.  I would consider doing apps first and then work your way into the rolls.  There are so much to choose from and unless you are really hangry and have no respect for your stomach ORDER THEM ALL.  I love the menu and it truly breaks it down for you.  This place will also blow you away with their JPOP/KPOP decor.  The place has beautiful waitresses who will cater to you and explain everything.  I suggest giving it a try and get to bop your head to some B2K.  The parking lot is not bad during weekday but be warned this place fills up very quicky.  So come one - come all!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

It is tucked away in the first floor in the corner.  There are all you can eat lunch and dinner options. Both include appetizers, sushi rolls, sashimi, and dessert. They do sell sake but it is an additional charge.  The sushi was amazing, like melt in your mouth amazing. I do have to say this is the best sushi I've had to date in Las Vegas.  The staff was friendly and came by often to check on us.",

This place is fitting for a party (group of 18), but cannot reserve on the weekends. They can accomendate all your needs for the perfect sushi experience. Also, it's great for a group of friends or dates if you want to eat good for the night. Anything you want or need, Sushi Neko will provide!!  I love the sushi here.

The fish to rice  ratio is unheard of for AYCE and the price is comparable. The fishb portion is more apparent in nigiri. My personal fave is the super white tuna. Great selection of appetizers too. My only complaint is that the food servers sometimes don't get all of your order out if you ordered a good number of items at one time and we've had a dish or 2 placed on our table that wasn't outs. Still, easy to overlook because the food is just so good.",

    "text": "I went to a Sushi Neko for the second time today:  A hostess whose name tag read \"Panda\" seated us.   Immediately, the two small soy sauce dipping plates were very dirty. As soon as our waitress came by (a young girl with long red hair), to take our order, we asked for clean ones. She apologetically took them and came back with new ones, and we placed our order (California Roll, Yellowtail nigiri, Lobster Baked Roll, and Salmon Lover Roll). I also ordered two waters.  We got our Cali Roll right away. No waters. Gradually, we got the rest of our order. Good timing. One of them was spicy, so we had to order our waters from a male busser. He said, \"Oh, you didn't get your waters?\" We said no and he came back with two waters.   We already had about six rolls left of our order at this point. As I was sipping my water, I noticed black marks on the cup and tried to scratch them out from the outside. They didn't come off. I took my straw and scratched the inside of it. Sure enough, the stains were inside the cup.   That was definitely strike three, so I immediately approached the hostess and asked for a manager. She told me there wasn't one available, so I asked for a supervisor, or anyone in charge. She attempted to dissolve the situation, but at this point, I was adamant about letting \"upper\" management know.   A chef by the name of Sai (?) came out to speak to me and I let him know of everything I was not happy with. He definitely hesitated, but I wasn't looking for anything but to be validated. I just told him it was not okay and he agreed. I also let him know that I did not mind paying for what I had already ate (keeping in mind that the dirty cups came WAY after the order was placed). He finally offered to cover half the bill and I was okay with that. I thanked him. As I was walking out, the entire staff said sorry and I just thanked them.  I hope they get to this because we know how hard it is to work for tips or how much products cost. So if it's of any importance to them, they will try to improve it for their other customers because I will not be going back.  The food seems of good quality (4/5) The service is too unorganized (2/5) Atmosphere is okay (3.5/5) Cleanliness needs major improvement (2/5)",

The miso soup was the best I've had anywhere and the fish on the nigiri pieces was very generous as everyone describes in other reviews. One piece of advice is to make sure and order 1/2 rolls on the 8 piece styles.  The rolls are large and very filling, but we didn't think to ask until afterwards if they did 1/2 rolls. The last thought is that the music is loud and annoying as they play weird Asian pop videos, but will definitely be heading back.",

For about $26, you can eat all the sushi you can fit into your stomach for dinner! The fish to rice ratio is really good and pretty much every fish I had was good (none of that super fishy taste except for things like mackerel which I don't know how people could eat that). I recommend trying the gyoza, lemon salmon, orange blossom, Chanel, and lobster roll. The waitress recommended trying \"The Shit\" which is one of the 2 highly recommended items, but I personally did not like it. I'm not sure what taste they were going for, but I can only remember a fried outer shell with mushy imitation crab (?) on the inside. The dipping sauce did make it taste a bit better, but I'm still not convinced as to why it is highly recommended. They also have a bunch of one time order only items like salmon belly, so needless to say, order those for sure! The skewers were really good to. I got the sausage one and the bacon and scallop (highly recommended and a nice break from just eating sushi).  Note: Dessert is also included on the menu! You can pick one ice cream flavor in addition to one of their other items (i.e. mini honey brick toast, mochi, tempura ice cream, etc.)  Overall, if you are looking for a good sushi place, definitely check this place out. They also play lots of Korean music videos if that is what you're into as well xD. The cat design is pretty neat so cat lovers be sure to go here! I'd recommend going here on a Friday or Saturday night because it has such a lively atmosphere and it gives you something fun to do! Only thing is there might be a wait. I went with a friend around 7:30 on a Friday night and we just had to wait about 15-20 min.",

I definitely think they're good with sushi to rice ratio. It's also nice that they have half roll options. There were so many rolls I liked that I couldn't say there really was a bad one. And the nigiri was on point, too.  It's pretty good for groups.  I visited twice and both times there were several large groups.  My only gripes: they don't have a set waiter it seems and we kept getting asked for drinks and food when someone had just come around. And then by the end there was no one who was coming around. And then also the issue with the regulation of ordering. I guess though, when you order a lot",

I'm giving them 3 stars because almost every time I come here they forget half of my order, which results in my table having to re order and even then we don't get everything. Also the customer service is semi okay dependent upon who you get. Some are super sweet, the others are pushy and kinda snappy.",

The ambiance is very relaxed and hip, with cool murals on the walls and this really unique wooden tree installation.  The service was so speedy and polite, and the servers stopped by often to make sure we were doing okay!   Now as for the food...all the dishes I ordered were amazing!! The fish to rice ratio was very generous with the fish and it was very fresh tasting. Though I only ordered a few rolls, the menu had a lot of variety, and everything that I ordered was exceptionally flavorful and saucy!   I'm already missing Sushi Neko, and I'll definitely come back here for my next sushi fix!!",

We read all the reviews on YELP and I made the choice, choosing Sushi Neko. BAD CHOICE!!!  The nigiri sushi was ok but everything else we ate was subpar. The hamachi collar was overcooked and oily, the yakitori sticks were very small with tiny shrimps or dried out sausages, the seafood salad were scraps of salmon throw on lettuce, the agedashi tofu was dry and small as your fingernail and their dessert of tiramisu was dry and tasteless.  And to top it off the men's restroom was filthy with overflowing trash and sticky urine floor, DISGUSTING!!!  Can't understand the 4 star rating.",

    "text": "First time coming with a few of Co-workers after a hike & I can honestly say it was alright. I had high expectations due to some reviews & word of mouth but it wasn't what I expected for the price of ACE. Once we got seated we had a waitress who was nice & tried her best, but when she came to ask for our drinks a few asked for water & assumed thats what everyone wanted & walked away. It probably took me 15-20 min just to be able to ask for a sprite. As she came to my section of the table to get the rest of our orders she walked away again & forgot to ask what the 2 others seated in front of us wanted. Order a few appetizers - got them right away- & order 3 signature rolls. I received 1 roll which was the \"burning my Ass roll\" (was really good & would come back just for that), but didn't receive my 2 other rolls for about 30 minutes (basically had to reorder) once I got it I didn't like it at all & I was full already so I had to force myself to eat it.   **My biggest problem though was with a certain waiter. He didn't know any of the names of the rolls so we had to attempt to figure out which rolls were what & who ordered them. I felt disrespected & felt a lack of common curtesy from him. We would all be eating & he'd be looking over our shoulders searching for empty dishes. I get it your trying to clear out our table but he wouldn't say anything & reach his arm right in between our faces mid eating & his armpit is literally 2 inches from my face. The funny thing was he wouldn't ask if we were done with empty dishes in the middle of our table but when we decided to put them at the end of the table to avoid armpit in our face he asked if we were finished with them???***   I'd would give them another chance..maybe there other stuff is really good. I'll just have to find out whenever I came back.",

    "text": "Tucked into a little dark corner in Chinatown is one of the best places for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas... Seriously.  I try to stay away from AYCE places because many of them a) make their rolls too small in order to make more money off of the customer, b) have less than ideal quality sushi sometimes, or c) cost too much for the minimal amount of time you are given for AYCE (i.e. some places it is 30 or less minutes).   HOWEVER, when I came to Sushi Neko with a colleague, I was pleasantly surprised! Their lunch portion of AYCE is almost $21.00 (which is AWESOME!), and dinner is about $25.00. For lunch you are given 60 minutes, and 80 minutes for dinner. If you order AYCE, the full menu is available to you (excluding 4-5 items which are for dinner customers only). I ate quite a bit of sushi in that time, and all of it was DELICIOUS!  My personal recommendations: The Butter Fly! It has peanut butter, but I swear it is amazing! The Popcorn Lobster The Honey! Screaming O! The Wet Dream Appetizer - \"The Shit\" - You seriously will not be disappointed if you like spicy crab The Baked Lobster The Philadelphia And pretty much anything else on the menu.  Here you can also order 1/2 rolls to try new things and not have to eat something you hate. The staff is helpful and friendly and the service is quick.  5 stars all around!!!",

The sashimi roll, wrapped in cucumber, was a good mix of flavors with generous cuts of tuna, salmon, white fish, and crab. Both the Hawaiian roll and red dragon rolls were good as well with ample fresh ingredients and minimal rice.  Nigiri is good too. The cuts of fish are large and the rice is well seasoned. Their menu has plenty of small bites available like pork belly -- two thing slices of fatty and meaty pork. I loved the subtle sweetness of the sauce.  Desserts were decent. They have mini versions of honey toast using Hawaiian roles toasted, covered in honey and topped with vanilla ice cream. With the tempura ice cream, I thought the dough was too thick and slightly undercooked.  The service was great and the interior is beautiful, modern and kitschy with anime and super hero items found throughout. The most impressive element is the large wooden tree towards the back of the dining room.  4.5 Stars",

I don't know why, but I had fallen off and hadn't eaten here in a while.  Last month my boyfriend was craving sushi so we came in, and we've been back at least once a week since! The fish to rice portions on the nigiri are absolutely ridiculous (in the best way possible). The fish tastes soooo fresh. My favorites are lemon salmon, white tuna, and the albacore! My boyfriend only gets rolls and his favorites are the Lobster King and the Popcorn Lobster.   The variety of desserts are what really makes them unique! The mini honey toast is the perfect size and tastes great. I've also tried the green tea ice cream, tiramisu, mochi, affogato, and the birthday cake! :) All were great.   Servers are friendly and check on you often. Food also comes out insanely fast. Would definitely recommend.",

We ordered a bunch of stuff right away including my favorite white tuna, uni and sweet shrimp. We also ordered a bunch of different worries including the salmon, tuna, albacore, yellowtail. The fish to rice ratio is pretty good.  The service was also very nice, our drinks were filled without asking. The restaurant is kind of small and intimate, which is better than a lot of the larger more warehouselike feel sushi joints in town. They also had some nice dessert options that we really enjoyed.

    "text": "\" The Best Sushi Restaurant in Las Vegas\" quote My self   Got the recommendation from a close friend and wow. Pulled up and thought , not sure, not to amazing from the out side, as soon as you walk in slap to the face it's awesome. Full of neat art work , cool music, and nice people.  We were seated right away , our waitress went over the menu and suggested a few things. The wife and I did all you can eat ( very affordable $25 a person ). I started with a few of the suggestions and some nigiri.  The nigiri,  each pice was perfect,  great size , great taste and quick( literally about 3 min and my full plate of nigiri was at the table) . All the types of fish I ordered were delicious. The tuna quality was top notch amazing texture and taste.   THE ROLLS, incredible the wife ordered them and I have no idea what the names were but they were all amazing , they offered 1/2 orders so we could try different combinations, and they were all pretty amazing.   So all in all this place kicks ass , it will be my new spot. I now feel I need to reevaluate some older reviews at different places cause no where is this good!!   Can't wait to go back !!!!!!!!",

Sodas are not refillable probably because they come out in soda cans. Went for a birthday hoping to get them to dim the lights play the birthday song and sing along, was told it had to be the actual birthday even though it was 2 days later no biggie understandable a lot of people want things for free. Any how everything was fresh and served fast. There was no rush for you to eat and leave. I would recommend this place. 4 stars due to no refills on sodas",

There are so many rolls to choose from there is something for everyone. The nigiri is amazing because the amount of fish to rice you get can't be beat. The service is usually great and to top it all off is the AYCE price making it all worth it with out breaking the bank.",

The sashimi that they have has very large cuts of fish.  I wasn't too big of a fan of the spicy garlic edamame, they had a bit too much sauce on it however everything else was great!  The bathrooms were well kept, the servers seemed to all be working together as a team, and my water glass was never left empty!  The ambiance is neat as well.  The only negative was that at the end we asked to split the check three ways and the girl said they couldn't do that.  I explained to her how to do it and of course they were able to.  Besides that, everything was amazing and we left with full bellys!  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Saw a poster of Sushi Neko outside of Hwaro. Since Hwaro is my go-to KBBQ, I figured I could give Sushi Neko a shot since they are owned by the same management company! Sushi Neko is located in the Chinatown Plaza that is directly across the KFT/Curry Zen Plaza. It's a bit hidden so park in the back, and you'll see the sushi house as you drive by.  We walked in just to see that it is completely empty. We were a tad bit hesitant since it was weird to find a restaurant empty for lunch but we gave it a chance anyway. Overall, their menu is very similar to Sakana's but once the rolls came out, we learned that they make it differently. So if you enjoy the types of rolls at Sakana, you can try this place for a different twist of your favorites.   Their fish to rice ratio is pretty good! They have a wide range of options for rolls and appetizers. The only thing about Sushi Neko was that they overload their rolls with sauce. If you enjoy that, then this is the place for you. But personally, I prefer to have light sauce because I like to taste the fish!   Overall, it was OKAY. As most AYCE sushi places in Vegas are typically crowded with long wait lines, I would suggest coming by for a quick sushi fix.  PRO TIP: ORDER PAPRIKA SALMON AND OCEAN TROUT!",

When those huge beautiful pieces of nigiri landed in front of me, my friend and I could only reply with \"wow\". The fish to rice ratio is the best I've found probably ever! It was so amazing. I can't rave enough about it. It was easily two to one at least. The squid was great. They have half rolls so you can try everything. The surf clam and octopus are among the best I've had! The atmosphere is fantastic. I'm definitely bringing more people here. The service was great. The chef were pros putting out our order at lightening speeds. I'm in love with this place.  Update: Make sure to try \"The Shit\" and say hi to the great service provided by Elaine and Edison.",

It's located in the SF Supermarket plaza in Chinatown just past Decatur on Spring Mountain Road.  The restaurant had tons of seating and no wait time, which is another big plus over Goyemon. The sushi here was also top notch - the rice to fish ratio was very favorable. For dinner, you can order special items like uni and salmon toro nigiri. They had a nice selection of rolls - stand outs include Salmon Holic, What the heck Roll, and the 300 hand roll. Service was really quick too. I'd highly recommend Sushi Neko if you are in the mood for a high quality sushi buffet.",

    "text": "I have been a long-time customer and have eaten with Neko for years since the opening of their sister restaurant, Sakana. I've brought many family and friends here for AYCE sushi fix since the food is good. Lately, I have noticed that the service has gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's a change in management or what... Today I encountered a server named Hallie who was very stubborn. I was ordering dessert and normally the ice cream is unlimited and you get to choose one dessert from below (I have a picture as proof). Hallie was saying that if I got the ice cream I wouldn't be able to select an additional dessert.  The menu clearly states otherwise. Even if they decided to change their policy, they should update their menu to reflect those changes.  Next time, I will pick to come to Sushi Neko on a day where Joy is working because we always receive excellent service from her.",

    "text": "\"Wow\" was definitely the word that was uttered most of the night, along with the catchphrase, \"service so fast you get whiplash!\". It's beautiful inside, but that's more of the cherry on top to a fantastic restaurant like this. My party and I were seated on a busy Saturday night within 10 minutes, and the sushi was amazing! As other reviews have stated, the nigiri had a fish to rice ratio of 2:1 which is SO rare to see, with fish that had quality taste. We were extremely hungry so we'd quickly clean a plate and perhaps it was coincidence but the staff would immediately remove our plate the moment we took the last piece of sushi off, and it would happen every time! When we ordered dessert, it had felt like we just put the order in and turned our heads away before they came back with our ice creams and cute mini honey toasts. So basically what you need to know is: great food, great service, typical AYCE price, nice ambiance!",

I don't know if there was a change in management or what, but the food wasn't good. The fish to rice ratio was terrible! I couldn't believe they had such big cuts of fish with a tiny amount of rice. Also, they forgot to bring out some of the things we ordered which I'm used to. The servers were also rude to us. Bad service isn't that big of a deal to me normally but the food wasn't good either so it was overall not a good experience. How are you going to play a Jiro Ono documentary but have your own sushi so lackluster :/  Update: all three of us who ate there got sick afterwards",

I get to the car to check my food and notice that my food was cold and incorrect. Instead of the California rolls they gave me Philadelphia rolls not deep fried. I go back to the restaurant which is 10:02pm and they decided to make the order over. I'm not understanding how the second order took 30 minutes as well when it was supposed to be expedited because of their mistake. If I knew that it was going to take almost 1 hour and a half I could have just sat down to eat. For this I will not be returning as a customer",

We look forwarded on eating Hamachi Kama and they were all out, even the Salmon Kama. I ordered the tamago sushi and wasn't served it. They apologize for the wait cause they had to bake it and it will take awhile. We were there for a hour --- WOW! still didn't eat it.. We ordered the tempura ice cream. It tasted very doughy like it was pre-cooked not made to ordered. Also got a tiramisu, it must have been sitting in the fridge for awhile, it was a very DRY small bite size cake with lots and lots of whipped cream. It was a busy restaurant so with all that attention they need to keep up and maintain the demand and quality.",

We go to Lotus for Thai and have been to Nobu and Morimoto, but frankly at this price and quality we'll be adding this to the roster of restaurants we visit.  The rolls were WOW! I had the Lisa Lisa and California plus some others I can't remember. Really great. My dining companions had the fish on top of the rice and said that this was good too. I asked because I thought  maybe the rolls were drenched in sauce because the fish wasn't good quality but they said the pieces without any sauce were fresh and excellent.   Service was polite and fast.  The only \"dings\" and I didn't deduct a star are as follows (you're welcome):  1. The tofu cubes in broth. Yuck. I can't remember the name but I've had  this in other place and it was crispy tofu. This was like a wet paper towel in broth.  2. The tempura. Extraordinarily blah. No flavor. The tempura was white. They need to fry hotter and longer so it's crispy and flavorful. The shrimp tasted almost raw.  3. Dessert. Yuck. I had the fried banana. And it was practically raw dough on a banana. Really guys, this is not hard to make. Hot oil, good batter ...  My dining companion ordered the honey toast or whatever it was called and it was equally bad. It was like a wet roll with some honey or syrup on it.  If they correct the three areas, it would truly be a superb place that you daydream about!!!  None the less, I loved it.",

They made sure we liked every food we ordered & asked us for our opinion. The fish was fresh specially the tuna & their appetizer choices are better than other sushi places we've been to. Their appetizer portions are small enough so you can taste everything on the menu.   The only bad thing was after paying the check and we left the tip, we were still eating and this guy who didn't serve us AT ALL picked it up. At least wait for us to finish or have the servers who were actually taking care of us get it. So we can show how appreciative we are to those who took care of us.  Other than that, everything was delicious & service was wonderful! Definitely our favorite sushi place now :D",

My friends mostly complained that the fish (literally everything I guess) tasted super cold. And it's not suppose to be served that cold.   Other than that, and the somewhat slow service in terms of some foods coming out, I enjoyed myself. It's probably cus I'm not going to be eating 50% fish and 50% rice. I had more fish than rice so that always makes me happy. I would definitely come back.   You can request fresh wasabi. The wasabi they provided us were very minimal so you'll probably have to request for more like my friend had to.   They do charge for hot tea, FYI. Try their trout nigiri. I believe that was one order per person. No limit on mochi ice cream :0D.   The staff is definitely friendly and they seem very attentive, too. My hot tea was practically always full and in other places I have to struggle to get it refilled.",

I went in with a group of friends at around 7:30 pm and they told us it would be about an hour an a half wait- which was fine because they were busy but upon returning they told us we had to wait an additional 10-20 minutes. Those 10-20 minutes turned into 55 minutes!! During the whole ordeal we were waiting outside in the cold as there was no space for us inside. They continued to seat people who arrived AFTER us. I would not recommend this establishment and will personally not be returning.",

Nice art work on the walls, modern K-Pop music, and wait staff is professional and attentive.  Staff easily handled a group of eleven without a problem.  Kept food coming, cleared empty plates, refilled teas and water.... All with a smile.  Plenty of Nigiri choices with a high fish to rice ratio.  All the fish that we had was fresh at lunch on a Sunday.  One order of Sea Trout per AYCE diner...you need to remember to order this one.  Unagi was nicely baked and a large piece.    Large volume of cooked dishes:  Shrimp Tempura, Udon Noodles, Bacon Wrapped Scallops, ..who doesn't like bacon!?!  Remember to order dessert.  Green Tea Ice Cream, Mochi Ice Cream, Panna Cotta...  A definite place to go for AYCE Japanese food when in Vegas.",

Even over the phone I knew I would enjoy my time there as they were friendly and more than helpful hearing I was 1. visiting and 2. celebrating a birthday. They arranged everything nicely for us.  When we got there our table was ready and the staff was great. They immediately broke down the menu for us and explained the \"all you can eat\" to us. They also explained what was allowed and what was not and gave us ample time to learn the menu. Once our server came back he helped us choose our first round and gave us a sheet for our second.  The quality was great and being from Hawaii we understand quality seafood. It was fresh and the \"restaurant favorites\" we're definitely worth trying.   When it came to drinks I tried the yogurt soju drink and it was great. I even bought one for my sister for her birthday. They talked us through the dessert menu and even brought my sister a complimentary birthday dinner, as well as a song with the whole restaurant.   Thank you, Sushi Neko!",

    "text": "When Shuseki closed it doors, I've waited to see what will pop up next to take its place. I was pleasantly surprised that another AYCE sushi joint finally emerged! The staff surprisingly reported it's the same owner of Sakana and Hwaro. Woot! Woot!  I like the way the menu is set up. It's organized and the font size is easy to read. They truly revived the interior decor, but kept the dining areas the same set up as the previous restaurant. It's in the same plaza as Kaba Curry, Cafe Teaze, and Swish.   This place gets a BIG PLUS for offering half rolls, allowing you to expand your options. The dinner price of $25.95 and lunch price of $20.95 are comparable to other AYCE sushi. There is a time limit. 80 min for dinner and 60 min for lunch.   I am not going to bore anyone how the appetizers, skewers, and sushi tasted like ;) I think that each sushi restaurant has its own distinctive taste and with their own signature sauces. It's whatever floats your boat! You decide! LOL! The fish to rice ratio gets another great applause! I would definitely come back since I barely tasted the items on the menu.",

Everyone was obviously hungry and our guests had never been there before.  Our waiter (young guy) seated us with 2 menus for 14 people.  We asked for additional menus but were told there were no more.  As we have visited many times before, my family just notifies the waiter/waitress what we would like, never been a problem before.  This round, the 14 of us were given two sheets of paper to self order nigiri and rolls.  Some of the party members were older and couldn't read the menu well.  We asked why we just couldn't order through him and he said it was the policy for large parties.  Obviously with 10 new people (first time to Sushi Neko and ayce) and 2 menus and 2 sheets, it took forever just to place a sushi order.  Additionally, the roll names are different or missing from the paper sheet...  To top it off, none of our premium fish arrived.  It was a disappointing trip and the party advised to try another location next time.",

Some of the old favorites from sakana like \"the shit,\" a spicy crab/deep fried..well shit looking roll that you dip in spicy mayo and eel sauce makes a return here along as some new ones I've never seen before like \"the pong.\"  Imagine a bruschetta and volcano roll meet and do the dirty, and have a delicious appetizer child, and thus, there you have it.. \"the pong.\"  If you haven't tried sakana yet and aren't sure what to expect from neko, a good portion of their sushi rolls and nigiri utilize a lot of ponzu and citrus flavors.  (Some honorable mentions to try: sushi burrito, the pong, 911, and trout nigiri)  Other items like oysters and Shashimi are 1 order per person while nigiri is unlimited in the ayce option. Dessert is also 1 order per person while Ice cream is unlimited.  Alcohol is not yet present but will be coming soon.  The service is pretty good, I tried the ayce option on my first visit and then ordered the salmon entree at my second time coming.   The owner can be a little chatty but is very nice and explained the sushi dishes as well as a little history along with it if you like learning a thing or two (I know I do)..and when my entree came out, he even added a few pieces of shrimp tempura and some paprika salmon nigiri to \"brighten up\" my entree because he felt it \"looked a little weak.\"  It's a must try if you haven been yet, and you're looking to check out a new sushi place.",

I came here because of the reviews and even though I was nervous (because AYCE and good sushi do not usually go together) this was a very good experience.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The AYCE sushi menu was fairly extensive and had good offerings.  The nigiri was very good; fish was fresh, placed on a small piece of rice vs most AYCE places where they try to stuff you with rice.  Very tasty and well prepared.  This AYCE can give a lot of traditional sushi restaurants a run for their money.  So, why no 5 stars? Because when it came time to settle the bill, I whipped out my AMEX and they told me \"we do not take AMEX\". There was absolutely no sign anywhere warning customers \"we do not take AMEX\" so that is also a violation.  Thankfully, I did not have any other cars with me so it was either AMEX or I was getting a free lunch. Actually, after a 10' standstill where they were going back and forth with the manager (it felt like I was buying a used car!) and then telling me \"oh, it's going to cost us a $30 additional charge because we are not set up for Amex\" to the waitress claiming \"it will come out of my pay\" (ridiculous) I offered for me to go to my place of work (2 miles away) and retrieve another credit card. They did not want to do that even though I was promising them that I would not vanish...  All of a sudden, they said they would process my card but \"only for this time\"...whatever!  It really left a bad taste in my mouth where this would have been a stellar experience and a solid 5-star review...  Loved the food, service was very good (until the bill game) but the end was just horrible. Won't be back (unless they start taking A",

But everything else was just not worth 25.95 a person . Fish was all warm and swimming in ponzu ... yuzu and other sauces. The rice was over cooked and rolls fell apart. The Japanese lasagna was just.... smooches!  And the appetizers.... was a 2 star at best. Order got lost even though they had an iPad to take down orders. Had to ask many time for the food and reorder for missing ones. Over all app got a 2 food got a 1 flavor was a 2 at best and interior feel got a 3 just overly decorated for no real good reason.",

So this was a nice substitute and we love AYCE sushi.     The atmosphere was really fun, we were seated right away and they were pretty busy. We, of course, ordered the AYCE and definitely had our fill. The rolls and appetizers came quick and our waitress was on it. She was awesome and kept checking on us to see if we needed more which is always great for an AYCE because sometimes a restaurant will seemingly avoid you when asking for more! But no issues here!     The rolls and appetizers were fresh and delicious. What I did notice was that the rolls were not overloaded with rice, so we didn't fill up on rice and actually got to enjoy the roll itself! I'll definitely be back and suggest this location to friends, they are great!",

The service this trip was waaaaaay slower than last time especially relating to the amount of time it took to get the food we ordered and there were a few times we needed something and staff wasn't available. It's an AYCE place so I don't expect more than what we received. They did have a few cool items in the AYCE menu that I hadnt seen before so that gave them back the missed points for service.",

    "text": "The nice thing about Sushi Neko is that the ratio of fish to rice is large enough to the point where you can wrap the piece of fish completely around the small ball of rice. The actual fish quality is average. While other places like Goyemon will give you unlimited salmon belly, the orders are limited per person here. I did like the other one order per person nigiri pieces of ocean trout, uni, and ama ebi, which comes as pretty standard at many of the AYCE sushi places.   Many of the appetizers were hot messes such as the shrimp tempura (very soggy), calamari tempura (rubbery and chewy), and the agedashi tofu, which was lackluster. There is a portion of the menu that is strictly dedicated to no rice sashimi, which includes the seafood salad, towering sashimi, and sashimi roll. I highly discourage ordering these as the seafood salad is just a hodgepodge of the shittiest cuts of fish that were discarded and thrown together haphazardly.   My last gripe was on the dessert, which they were mostly out of due to a late delivery. I did enjoy the affogato with Korean style coffee and cornflakes, but all in all, I've had better AYCE sushi and ice cream options.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner last night with the bf. Like with all new places and highly rated yelp reviews, I was hopeful. The decor was urban and trendy. Appealing to the hipster crowd with some current hip hop music in the background. On a Sunday night, there was only one other table of patrons.  Currently they don't have any alcohol available. Our server said it would be another two weeks or so before it comes through, but he said once they do, house sake is BOGO all day every day.  Service was prompt and friendly. Our guy kept our water topped and dishes cleared. Good guy.  Now as far as the food goes, it leaves little to be desired. It was average quality like most AYCE spots. Wasn't good. Wasn't bad. Pricing is as expected; $25.95 for dinner. I was happy to see trout on the nigiri menu. That and the salmon belly were the only things I wanted more of. I ordered the ama ebi but was confused since it didn't come with rice and most AYCE places give you two per order but it was just one. I think our server said the same thing with the trout & salmon belly. The unagi tasted good but had a mushy texture I wasn't used to, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way. The Best of the Best was under the no rice menu but had rice in the center of all the fish. The server said the chef probably forgot how to make it and will remake another--which never arrived. The chef also sent out some specials which would've been fine except it was a way to fill us up and it wasn't that great. One was a super white tuna with a whole bunch of sauce and chili overpowering it and another was a seafood salad. The salad had shrimp with its tail still on and salmon with skin attached. Both ruined the experience instantly. Everything else was edible but average.  Would I give it a second shot? Mmmm... Not likely. If majority of the food was at least decent, maybe. But at the moment, no but thank you.",

This place is decorated with lots of Japanese decor but I dont think the background music is Japanese at all. First, I was welcomed warmly by the servers which I was pleased. We were seated on a table and yerin? An asian girl took my order right away. (I guess I looked like I was starving! I really was...) Our food came out REALLY fast and I was really happy with that. Also, the food is REALLY good, the portion of rice and fish was ideal. I only ordered sushi and it was well put together.  We were also served by Son (why not daughter?) and he gave me good recommendations about some appetizers, which I REALLY enjoyed.  Overall, this place is definitely a hidden gem in Vegas, especially because there are many other sushi places. Service and food were above expectations, i only wish this place could be easier to find. Will be back definitely!",

Nice atmosphere (except for the loud, weird music) and the service for AYCE was very quick and friendly -- didn't make us feel bad for ordering a lot of rolls like some places do.  I also liked that quite a few of their rolls were actually only half rolls, or even smaller (2 pieces).  It gave us the chance to try lots of different things.  We'll definitely be going back so we can try more!",

I was intending to go to one of the others and when we arrived, they had a 40 minute wait. When I'm in Vegas, I don't like to waste 40 minutes that I could be doing something fun, so I did a quick Yelp search and found Sushi Neko was a block up the road. Taking an educated risk (Yelp rarely steers me wrong) we jumped into the car a found Sushi Neko. There wasn't a wait and we were immediately seated. After looking at the extensive menu when decided to attack it hard with a variety of rolls and appetizers. At first, we thought the service was going to be slow, we were there on Saturday night, but it turned out to be perfectly paced. Instead of everything arriving at once, it was just a steady flow of our orders. I can tell you we got our money's worth and then some. The appetizers were delicious, I highly recommend the pork belly and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), and the specialty rolls rocked! I'm glad my usual spot was busy as I've found another solid spot that may have snuck into my #1 slot!",

    "text": "I am ready to give this place a mediocre 2 stars. Come here for the environment, but don't come here for amazing sushi.   Some people claim to be very experienced when it comes to food. I may not be the best critic in the Yelp Industry, but when it comes to AYCE sushi, I've been to almost every establishment in the business that I think I have some sort of idea what I'm talking about.   It's the rice. I absolutely hated the sticky rice. Sushi rice should never be hard; it should never feel like little tiny grains splitting apart so that you taste it crumbling in your mouth. It should be as the name says: sticky, chewy, a compliment deserving to the fish.  I thought that perhaps it might just be an off-day with the sushi chef, but I saw several other reviews having the exact same problem as me with their rice. I am also salmon-lover, but the salmon in this joint looked very... discolored.   I tried Tobiko for the first time. I know it's my fault for ordering it, but that thing is disgusting. On the bright side, I also tried salmon belly for the first time and theirs is spot-on! In fact, try any of their special nigiri and you'll forget about the rice mishap. They're all very good.   I was very disappointed with some of the side dishes on the menu. The chicken karage and KFC tasted exactly like the same dish, fried the same way. The salmon carpaccio was mediocre. In my opinion, the sauce overpowered the taste of the salmon.   If you like cheese, I suggest trying the Pang.   One that that I do love about this place, as I mentioned in the beginning of this review, is the interior decor! So creative, so artistic; it felt like I was in Japan or Korea for a moment.   -------------------  My boyfriend got a horrible, lasting stomach ache immediately after we came back from Sushi Neko. He couldn't function that well for several days after, having to eat very light meals to soothe his aching stomach. Had horrible constipation. He talked to some of his coworkers at work, and they said that they also had friends who had similar stomach aches after coming here. Food poisoning, maybe?",

Screaming \"O\" Roll Ocean Trout Nigiri Surf Clam Nigiri Vegas Roll \"Just Try It\" Roll  The Fish to Rice ratio was really amazing as it provided more fish than the rice to ensure that you can eat more and more. The quality of the fish tastes fresh and generously sliced. The waiter service is phenomenal as they would patiently take your order with efficient accuracy. Drangon, one of the sushi chefs there would provide us with chef specials with enthusiasm! The sushi was served quickly after I have ordered and the time spent waiting was even more enjoyable as they had Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\" playing on the television. Their Lunch Ayce starts at 11:30am-4pm and their dinner starts at 4pm-11pm. I'm not exactly sure what the difference between the lunch and dinner items would be, but I am excited to try! I've decided to come here Tuesday night for another amazing ayce experience!",

Although I had bad service the first few times I went,  their chefs and servers now are super friendly!  They offer buy one get one free for their alcohol all day, which is a great deal. I just wish they had more refreshing choices of rolls instead of having shrimp tempura in half of them.",

The Uni was extremely fresh, and they were nice enough to even accommodate my request to get it with quail egg on top. I also recommend trying the Hawaiian kalbi steak that one of the servers recommended me trying, cooked to perfection not over seasoned but had a combination of sweet and a little kick of heat, and extremely tender that I had to get another order of it. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful,along with the owner.",

I love the renovations and I'm so happy for them that the business is growing. Great prices for rolls!! Best option is when you can order half. Pieces are bitesized which gives you an opportunity to try more. But I feel that the customer service went from outstanding to terrible. We've come as a group and they've brought numerous wrong dishes to our tables or totally forgot part of our orders and since they're so busy with more customers, it's hard to flag someone down who's willing to help out without telling us to wait for our assigned waited. It's such a shame. Old servers used to remember us, offer us recommendations, and now I feel like most of them are robots.",

My good friend wanted to go to lunch and suggested this place and of course I said OK! because I had been eyeing this place. She was excited because they had ocean trout for AYCE. I am writing this review now after coming here like 5-6 times. First, let me tell you - the rice to sushi ratio? UH MAY ZING, This fish can literally wrap around the sushi like 1.5 times. I was super impressed by this. The food comes out really fast after ordering as well. The food is just good. They even have mini udons and mini honey toasts! I just really like this place alot and come here at least once a week know haha The fish to rice ratio is what makes me keep coming back to this place. Oh - they also play alot of kpop videos haha",

    "text": "I come to Sushi Neko fairly often as it is by far one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to. Ever since I had started coming to the restauarant, there has always been a clear separation between the morning staff and the night staff. The night staff is always on top of it or quick to right any wrongs. The morning staff is always a little bit unprofessional.  Today has hit the limit for me. When refilling our waters, one server had us bring our cups to one side for easy reach-understandable and much more efficient. What wasn't efficient was how she forgot to fill up our waters after that. She also brought our desserts to the table and, instead of asking us who had gotten what, she instead put the tray and told us to grab ours/pass them out. On the date of making this review (02/22/2019) the menu states that gratuity is added automatically if the party is 6 or more people-as it always has been. When we asked for the check, gratuity was added for a party of 5. They informed us they had changed it last week (02/10-02/16). There was a policy paper on the door,but nowhere had it said that gratuity had been included for parties of 5+ now. Picture included of policy paper, taken (02/22/2019 @ 1:30pm)  Review written 02/22/2019 @ 1:45pm  Visit 02/22/2019 @ 12:12pm-1:30pm",

    "text": "On the last day of Xmas my infant daughter gave to me...  2 hours of naptime so a couple of weary parents could gorge ourselves on surprisingly good sushi (after surviving a week of extended family) :P Fed my daughter, got her to nap on the drive over, put the cover on the stroller and rolled her next to our table. While she dozed, we went to town on Sushi Neko's hilariously named sushi rolls.    Interior: Plenty of space. Clean seating area, brightly lit. Trendy, artsy decor, with music videos on full blast. I haven't heard that much K-pop since I taught high school.   Food:  Most of it was really good, and much of it had the most ridiculous names (\"Burning your ass roll\", \"Wet Dream,\" you get the picture).   Standouts: Baked Lobster Roll -- my favorite, topped with small lobster pieces grilled. We had to have this one twice.  Something Wrong Roll -- the waitress's recommendation and it really was very good, especially since a lot of the other items were heavier and mayo based (this one uses a light citrus sauce). This one was fried shrimp and spicy soft shell crab on the inside, with tuna and salmon and whitefish alternating on the outside and a tangy ponzu sauce.  Double Dragon Roll -- fried shrimp and spicy tuna on the inside, eel, shrimp, avocado and eel sauce on the outside. This one was really good but a little spicy for me -- husband loved it Skewers -- Bacon and Scallop...  be still my heart, lol No Name Roll -- Eel and fried shrimp wrapped in soy paper, outside salmon, spicy mayo, eel sauce and crunchies. This one was really good.  Be Sexy Tonight -- shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese -- topped with salmon, unagi and crunchies and spicy mayo and eel. This one was heavy but still really good.  Monkey Brain -- Fried tempura banana with crab salad topping...  this one was ok, it was a little too sweet for me.  Only thing I was meh about was dessert -- while I had the ice cream mochi (you get 1), the \"tiramisu\" which really was anything but. It was more like a coffee flavored layered sponge cake with a dollop of whipped cream on the side.   Notes:  The pricing can be a la carte or using the all-you-can-eat rules ($30ish for adult, not sure if this is every evening but we came on Xmas day dinnertime). Part of rules -- they will charge if you leave food, or at least service does slow down. We came early, around 5PM. Service was ultra fast and they were taking our next orders by the last few bites of the previous order. Efficient and food comes out quick. Things started to slow down closer to 6.  Some items on the menu are limited if you do AYCE -- no-rice rolls are limited to just 1 per person, along with most dessert items.  You're able to get half rolls if the original order is a full roll (i.e. if it already says the order is 4-5 pieces, then you can't halve the order), which is great for sampling more items without getting as full.   Thanks Sushi Neko for being the ultimate reward / best way to top off our road trip :)",

    "text": "I loved Sushi Neko. They had amazing value for the nigiri, unique and flavorful rolls, and a really fun atmosphere.   However, today was my last visit at Sushi Neko. My family and I, a party of 8, (which is a pretty big sum of cash for Sushi Neko) were rudely greeted by a woman who seemed like she was already irritated by us. My uncle asked her how her day was, to be nice, and she said, \"Good. But I asked you how many people were in your group.\" Well, excuse him for being polite, a skill she's clearly not capable of.   Our would-be waitress tried to shove us all into two small tables at a booth, which would typically fit four. We asked her if we could move two of the two-seater tables together, since maybe she misheard us. She said something about how they were \"going to be too busy for us\" to move the tables to accommodate us, and then she stormed off. No management came to talk or intervene. We were all dumbfounded and kinda (really) angry.   I was a bit sad since my family had been customers at Neko before, and we loved the food. I'd always ask to go to Neko for special celebrations, and my whole fam would come in for graduations, birthdays, and get-togethers. No matter how good the food is, though, we're not chumps who take being disrespected lightly.   I'm giving Sushi Neko two stars for my previous experiences with them. Really great food, fun ambiance, and *once* friendly waitresses. It sucked cause my family (three dads included) was excited for some ayce sushi on Father's Day.   We went to Sushi Kaya instead, where we were seated comfortably and served by very attentive and kind people.   Sushi Neko-- please re-evaluate the values you have for customers who are not only fans but people. Your service treated us with a complete lack of respect today.",

    "text": "Normally I Love this sushi joint... only bad thing was the wait all the time. I wish they had a bigger indoor waiting room to accommodate for when it's cold outside. Reason I decided to update my review to a one star is because of a few things. 1) the mussels we ordered smelled spoiled and tasted bad. Unfortunately, I had already ate one,  I realized this after my second one that I tried and spit it out in my napkin. 2) we ordered a miso soup and the spoons and bowls were still dirty. Not only this, but when they brought it out they smelt like chemicals (like dish washing chemicals. I own a restaurant and I smell it everyday that's why this smell smelt familiar. Take the time to actually wash dishes after people and not just dunk, swish and serve. 3) they gave us plastic cups for water, and plastic spoons for our soup. I'm sorry but why do we have plastic? Not that big of a deal but when people around us ordering the same thing get legit cups, spoons , etc makes you wonder why. This restaurant is always slammed busy. Hire more people to make things run more efficiently and clean.",

My boyfriend and I can't resist their chef specials or the salmon belly. It's a can't miss. The salon practically melts in your mouth. The nigiri is really on point as well as the appetizers. My bf really enjoys the power up. The desert is great too. I've heard good things about the honey toast but I can never pass up a simple green tea ice cream. Worth it to come here. Hope they are done with renovations soon! We miss it! When This place reopened up it is better than ever. Everything is so amazing and I'm so impressed with the quality of food. I've gotten multiple friends addicted now. Totally worth it to try! Salmon Belly for life.   We have recently tried some new appetizers. The Pang really is amazing. It's fish with the same type of sauce as the baked green mussels on a delicious buttery piece of garlic toast. And we tried the KFC (not our favorite, Pa Dak is way better if you want to go with chicken at sushi)",

    "text": "*BEWARE* STAY AWAY! Seeming that I have never actually written a review for amazing service let alone subpar, I felt compelled to write a review about my recent experience at Neko Sushi. My big brother recommended this place to me last year and the first 3x we came here everything was great. We sat at the sushi bar (when they still sat the bar) and service was impeccable all the way around, however MUCH has changed...  Fast forward to today. My wife, newborn son and I sat at a table and ordered all you-you-can-eat, along with a bottle of Nigori sake and tall Asahi w/ 2 cold glasses. We also ordered our first round and asked for 4 orders of Hamachi. The server said, \"were all out\"..I said, \"your out of Hamachi??\" He said, \"yes\". I said, no Yellowtail?\"..Ohhh Yellowtail, yes no problem. Seriously?? Know your product and know your menu. Management is lacking big time here with training and customer service...I am a native to LV and worked in service industry for 15+ years from bistro to fine dining, but end of the day, this guy was clueless...Moving fwd. Our beer arrives and we received two large Asahi's when we only ordered the one. (not a big deal)  Our first order arrived and everything was correct, although we didn't receive the Yellowtail or our Sake. I waited a minute thinking that it would be on its way, but low and behold nothing. I then asked the server is the Hamachi and Sake coming and the guy looked like a dear in headlights and I basically had to reorder again and explain in full detail exactly what I wanted for now the 2nd time in my first 10 minutes of arrival. Really??  Round 2: My wife ordered a golden cali roll, which they do have 4 different kinds. Philly, Cali etc. and the server came back with the wrong roll. He did apologize and it was an honest mistake, but literally every time we ordered something upon every trip to our table the order was either input incorrectly or missed entirely. Space cadet  Round 3: Shift change. Our amazing server that we started with literally disappeared and a young women asked how we were doing while my wife was in the restroom and I simply requested the check since we were still eating, but ultimately wrapping up. She asked if we wanted dessert and I declined. Then she came at me and said, \"we will charge you for what you don't eat and to reference the menu\". Are you kidding me?? First off, I wasn't done eating and typically request the check prior so that we don't have to wait and can leave when we are ready, but that is the policy as she clearly outlined on the menu. I'm sorry, am I a paying customer that ordered 2 dinner menu items, along with 2 bottles of booze or am I a passer by asking to use the restroom?? Classless and rude..Period. I didn't say anything but was a little taken back when our new server said she would charge me for rice. Yes, that's right, rice!! \"read the menu sir\". Unbelievable.   So at this point, we have maybe 4 different items on our table and maybe 1 piece on each plate (if that) and we are full and done. It's time to go when the server (who previously took my credit card) is gazing over my table racking up additional charges in her head which we could clearly identify what she was doing and refused to charge until we finished our dinner!!! What are we 5 years old?? I paid for ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT and already received my bill and technically tried to pay and she was holding my card hostage until I cleared my plate?? Is this a joke?? Now I'm irritated and frankly getting angry. I told her close me out or give me my card NOW, regardless we are leaving. There are 2 options. You charge me for what I had and we leave, or we just leave..your call...The hovering over my table session finally ended and I walked up to the counter, paid my bill and left. My wife and I were absolutely baffled by the way we were treated like 3rd class citizens.   #1 This place wont last very long if they treat others how we were treated, and remember this was my 4th time here. There surely wont be a 5th!!!  #2 You're company policy is a joke. If you are trying to enforce this lame policy then maybe have your personnel explain that upfront prior to ordering so customers aren't blindsided when trying to close out and have a hovering server making up fictitious costs that even they cant calculate and topping off what was already a forgettable experience if that's what we want to call it.  #3 If you are going to charge for overage, maybe have somewhat of an idea of how to articulate what that entails. How much does rice cost?? How much per order of overage?? In our case, my wife actually asked, okay so how much does one piece of a roll cost? 1/6 of the menu cost?? 6 pieces total?? Then the server said we are only responsible for the Salmon belly which is a premium item. AND?? Where's the consistency?? Is this policy or let's make it up as we go??  ALL IN ALL - We will NEVER come back to this place!! Owner/Management figure it out! Your food is awesome!! What a shame!",

    "text": "Is a decent place if you only like eating one order.   The restaurant is a fine all you can eat sushi place, however most of it's problems lie in it's wait times. I've been to this location three times, all of which spanning around two to three hours since the sushi just never comes out. While the servers and chefs were all kind and attentive, most of the problem stems from the lack of them. The restaurant is quite large for an AYCE setting, yet in a full house there's really only two servers who double up as hostesses. Three chefs are located in front of a bar. With 30 - 40 guests on busy nights, expect a wait time of around 20 minutes per dish, if it is even the right one. The dishes have a tendency on going to the wrong table. I've been here on three different occasions with different waiters, yet I still have these problems regardless.  The sushi itself depends on the time and day. I highly suggest avoiding any time when the location is busy as quality heavily deteriorates. While the fish to rice ratio is the saving grace of the restaurant, if you really cared about the rice, just head to an AYCE Sashimi restaurant instead. The large portions are sloppily cut at times, leaving unwanted portions of the fish being served. While the menu has a lot to offer, many of them lack taste. (The Ebi is pretty much paper).  Don't go here yet, the place can get a lot better, but for now just stick with Jjanga or Goyemon.",

    "text": "First of all, spelling mistakes are already a turn off. The specials board stated \"salmon cappacio\" and \"stripped bess.\" When we entered, there was no greeting. We sat down and got one menu. I mean, it was not busy so there were no reason as to why we could not get two menus automatically, but we had to ask. First time here and the waiter did not explain anything just threw the menu on the table and walked away. There are two menus, one clearly says AYCE but the other did not. Was that their regular menu? We had no idea. So when another waitress came by we told her it is our first time and she said \"ok.\" Thanks for the welcome and the explanation of the AYCE. We had to ask and found out everything on the other menu is included too, but it was weird because it had curry plates and alcohol so I don't think it was all included. She just said it is all included. Not True because regular drinks like tea was not even included. Within a few minutes of sitting down I heard the people behind us ask where all their items were and the waitress sounded clueless as to them even ordering those items and said she would put it in. They said they already waited a long time and they just wanted to get out and they stood up and left. Another turn off was our original waiter coughed in his hand two times and then went to pick up plates and serve food. I had to ask him to wash his hands. Could have been why the rest of the night was downhill, but have we not heard of cough in the forearm or wash your hands since you are serving food?  From there we had the waitress who had no personality and did not get half our orders in and we had to follow up many times and when we reminded her she did not apologize or even seem like she was aware she made a mistake. Maybe it was her twin sister we ordered from.   My friend asked me what my Yelp review would be since she knew after a few dishes. I actually felt it was 3 stars and said let me tell you after we get more dishes. Well by the end it was down to 0 stars for me.   Out of all the items we ordered, it was so slow that at times we had to recap with each other what we had ordered and what was missing. Most fish came one at a time on a plate. Would make more sense if they put a bunch of nigiri on a plate, maybe they could keep track of what they had sent out or some other system since the one they have does not work.   Quite a few of the raw fish pieces looked like throw away pieces. I took one for the team and put it in my mouth and it was tough and had large slices in it, looked like it had been through a garbage disposal. Uni was off color and my friend said the taste was bad. Some fish would come on a plate and all were different colors, but it was the same fish. It was not consistent. Ocean trout was soaked in sauce and rice fell apart as you pick up the fish. We asked for majority of the items without sauce except yellowtail yuzu since I like yuzu. When we got the yellowtail it was plain with no jalapeno and no sauce but we wanted the sauce on the yellowtail. We told them and they seemed to get angry but we did order it regular because I like yuzu. We never got our \"salmon cappacio\" and many other orders. We had to ask and it was clear that it was never put in or somehow lost, because the waitress would write it down again.   About the sashimi salad- it was different both times I ordered it. One time it was good with very light ponzu sauce and it had tempura. The second order had a heavier overpowering dressing which was too strong and the tempura was gone.   Waiters were really odd here, no customer service skills at all. There is one tall guy who never spoke a word, a waitress who was a perfect candidate for \"Clueless\" and a waiter who wreaked of cigarette smoke and would throw the food slide the plate on the table and whisk away quickly. We did encounter one friendly and \"all together\" rare waiter there but it was not until the end. He was the best of all of them and wish we had him the whole time. It was only his second day.   I can go on and on, but in summary is the food was not good at all and the service was terrible.    The only part of the whole meal I liked was the salmon belly and salmon. The super white tuna was also different than what I have had but I liked it. I hope they can hire some better staff and work on bringing out all of the orders as well as their timeliness otherwise I don't see them lasting.  We were there over 3 hours and I enjoyed my time with my friend, but it should not take 3 hours to bring the things we ordered on a week night.",

To start this off, this review is a few weeks late so I can't give a better description on the food.. so bear with me. Haha. But some of their fish just didn't sit well. I think their tuna in one of their salads tasted really funky and the texture of it was nothing I was used to.. and i eat a lot of sushi, so with that, I was sketched out and barely wanted to eat anything else. The quality of their food was disappointing for the amount of 5 star reviews they off.  The only good thing was their nigiri. They had a lot of fish for the amount of rice they had.. and they had cute decor.. and that's about it. The customer service was eh, but that's expected from an Asian restaurant.   Overall, I wouldn't come back. I'll stick to jjanga or any where else other than here.",

Waitresses were great and attentive even when people started showing up. 4 stars because I asked how many pieces were in the Coco Shrimp roll and was told 4-5, but it came out as a full roll with like 8 pieces. Not a big deal, but that meant I had less room in my stomach to try other dishes!",

Everytime I try a new place (because I enjoy trying new places and that is how I discovered this hidden gem), I ask myself how these people stay in business when Sushi Neko is so close by and clearly the best sushi in town.

    "text": "Oh damn, made to order all you can eat sushi! Apparently there are quite a few of these in Vegas, but alas, we only had time for one...This one was fantastic! I'm glad that we ended up coming here. We came early on a Wednesday afternoon, so we had no problem getting a table (in fact, when we arrived there just before 5 PM, we were the only people there).  The service is a bit odd. Despite us being the only people there and there being 2 servers, they seemed to be preoccupied. There also seemed to be not so much a language barrier as a speaking barrier. It was difficult to understand our servers because they either weren't very clear in their explanations or they mumbled and spoke so softly that that we could barely hear them. At first, we were confused as to what was included in the AYCE deal -- turns out it's EVERYTHING on their menu! There are some items where they limit the table to ordering one or one per person. They also had a BOGO on their alcohol. We took advantage of that and ordered sake. It was ok, but at $10 for 2 bottles, I'm not complaining.  We ordered a ton of rolls!! It's good to come here with a group of people so you can order a bunch of things and get to try everything. As others have mentioned, they do a good job with the fish to rice ratio, so you actually get to enjoy the fish, instead of just stuffing yourself with rice. Additionally, their rolls come in smaller portions, which makes it ideal for trying a bunch of things. For example, some of their baked rolls only had 4 pieces. We weren't really sure what was what since the servers would bring out the dishes and then whisper/mumble the names of the rolls. Regardless, nearly everything we had was fantastic.  The few standout ones, with names that I actually heard were:  - The SHIT (appetizer): I have no idea what's in this (as this was mumbled/whispered to me), but it really is THE SHIT - The lemon shrimp roll: Adding lemon to sushi is brilliant! It makes it refreshing and actually felt like an aperitif, so we could stuff ourselves with more sushi - The lobster baked roll: this is some seriously oooey gooey delicious stuff.  - Fried rolls: it's fried, need I say more?  But seriously, the Shit was SO good!",

We ordered a total of 6 different sushi rolls. The owner took our order of 4 rolls, then another server took our sexond order (where we told her we're still missing our 4th roll and added 2 more rolls), and then a THIRD server brought us a roll that we didn't even order!  Over an hour later, we angrily got up and told one of the servers that we're not paying the AYCE dinner price and that we're only paying for 3 rolls. The owner apologized but the damage was already done. We liked this place when it was originally Shuseki.",

I decided to try this place after reading the glowing reviews from Elites.  From beginning to end, I had a terrible experience here.  This will go down as one of the worst service experiences I've had in recent memory.  We ordered drinks a few minutes after being seated.  10 minutes later, they were still not at our table.  Once we were ready to order, we tried to order food on 3 different occasions.  Each time, about 1/3 of what we ordered would show up.  After being out of food for a while, the server would stop by and ask if we wanted anything else, then look really confused when we asked about the additional items we ordered but did not receive.  It did look like there was one server to 20 tables, so I am hoping that is the explanation.  But it was Friday night.  Surely, it occurred to the manager that one server may not be sufficient.    I could have overlooked the terrible service had the food been good.  The food was average to below.  Nothing I tried was memorable and I would not return for the food, even if the service were acceptable, and it was not.  If you are looking for a great AYCE with great service, check out Sushi Koma.  It's worth the few extra bucks.",

Cherry blossom tree, artwork, teddy bear, etc. it had a \"japan\" feel to it and I like it. No one was there to greet us so we signed in. It looked like there was only two servers taking orders that's why it took a while for us to be seated even if there were many open tables. The food? We all enjoyed it! The rice to fish ratio for their nigiris and rolls is perfect (smaller rice portion)! It's comparable to Sakana which is great! Besides their flavorful nigiris, the pang is a must! They also have a variety of desserts that comes with the AYCE including honey toast, ice creams, and affogato.",

If only they had some type of rewards program like a punch card for getting a free ayce when you purchase a certain amount. I'd have like a whole bunch of free for all the times eating there lol. Service the past few times I've been going were not that great. We just went last week Sunday for my brother's birthday and they'd always forget something we ordered, and our waiter/waitress would never come to check up on us too see if we wanted to order more we always had to ask a busser or another employee. Which would still take forever. They left a bottle of water for us but never came to ask if we needed more and we did. On our bill we were charged 2x for soda and I was the only one who ordered a soda dr pepper. They charged us a coke too, I told them and they just gave me another dr pepper in a styrofoam to go cup. Other than that the food is a hit, but service could so better. It's always busy, but worth the wait. Fish to rice portions are perfect fish is bigger than rice. We always just get the load of nigiri lol and some of the specialty rolls from time to time. Only junk thing too us that it's only one dessert per person, which it should all be included in the ayce price it's like a tease. Must try if you love sushi.",

I also love the fact that they have so many different kind of nigiri, with ponzu, jalapeno, pepper etc, when you put it in your mouth, it's full of flavours! Miss the taste so much right now.  Last but not least, you can't beat the price! 26+tax/person for ayce sushi sounds much better than the 80+tax/person buffet on strip for me.

    "text": "Sushi was better than a few other sushi restaurants I've tried in Chinatown. That was of course until I got food poisoning from this place. My friends and I decided to get sushi after work one night. We all were eating everything just fine and most of us were trying each other's rolls or nigiri. I was the ONLY person who ordered AND ate the hamachi(yellow tail) and almost immediately got disgustingly sick. I needed to excuse myself from the table because I felt like I was about to throw up. Walked to the back of the restaurant and threw up everything I had just paid for. Needed my stepdad to come pick me up from dinner because I literally felt so sick. Threw up on the side of the road two more times before finally making it home. WORST sushi experience I have EVER had, and I've eaten a lot of raw fish coming from hawaii.   At first I thought it was just a one time thing. Until today, which is why I'm writing this review. I got a call from my mom asking what the name of the restaurant was that I got sick from, so I told her it was this. She told me that her friend ate here and immediately got food poising also. She asked me what I had and I told her that the hamachi was the only thing that I ate that my friends didn't even touch. So she texted her friend and asked if that's what he had and sure enough that's exactly what he ate also.  If you eat here please come prepared with a plastic bag in your car door just in case you gotta pull over to throw up. Highly highly highly suggest staying away from the hamachi with everything you do!!",

The first round we ordered everything cause we knew we'd be able to eat it all without a hitch. It came timely and we ate everything and it was pretty good. They have a lot of options which was cool but after the first round... That's when everything went downhill. We sat for more than half an hour without any more of our food coming to the table and servers nowhere to be found. Once we did get some food, we noticed that rolls were missing and servers couldn't even identify what fish they were giving us.    The place is decorated beautifully but that was about the only cool thing. We left still hungry cause we were just tired of waiting for so long. Not worth it :(",

The radish string suppose to be a long string, instead looks like a shredded cheese. Dip sauce for tempura has no taste and size of serving is smaller and than a shot glass. All the cut rolls were drawing in all kind of sauces. There is no way to taste the fish.. oh should I say what fish? If not one thing over power the other, or just hd no flavors what-so-ever. Tamago egg is not even house made. It is store brought redo to make it looked good.. no taste. There is no uniform serving dishes.. there were at lease 7 different styles of serving dishes.. from typical American dive plastic white plate to paper cup. The red bean ice cream taste like Ume red bean of some oddly unpleasant taste. The last but the lease was server who brought the ice cream hd his finger inside of ice cream cup when serving to the guests. I requested to hv it replace due to god for sake he hand clap and hand shakes with the guest next table over and serving us the dirty ice cream cup with his fingers within the cup... there was zero Japanese within the sushi restaurant!!    This restaurant has zero respect to the art of Japanese Sushi nor hv a clues how to do safety food serving practice.",

    "text": "Sushi Neko is our go-to spot for AYCE sushi. I believe that the pricing for lunch and dinner are slightly different. We usually opt for the dinner menu even if its lunch because they allow you to get certain items on the menu that are only available at the dinner menu price. Pricing for dinner AYCE is around $27 which makes it worth it if you usually eat a lot of rolls or nigiri sushi pieces. My husband and I order yellowtail nigiri, seaweed salad, towering sushi (can only order once per dinner price), pork belly, baked mussels, and salmon belly. The proportions of rice to fish is great! You won't get overly full from all the rice. Which is partly the main reason we like it so much here. If you don't eat the rice and just eat the fish sashimi style they may charge you for wasting. But this has never been an issue since rice portions are small.   Usually when we come here the wait is not too long. I've been here quite a few times and have not waited more than 30 minutes for a table. The service here is always good and their team always come by to check if you need anything to order ,or refill drinks and tea. Be mindful that ordering little by little may take the sushi chefs a while to prepare, so ordering different items at one time might be a good idea so you wont have to wait as long for each item to come out. The restaurant is quite large and there are a lot of seating for smaller groups, not too many tables available for large groups. Overall best AYCE sushi that ive been to with great ratio of rice to fish and great service as well.",

Was seated, and when we were about to order, the server tells us that tuna is not available due to not being prepared yet. I live for their garlic tuna nigiri and their cajun tuna nigiri! So being told that the tuna is not available at all was seriously disappointing. I asked how long it will take for the tuna to be available to order, and was told approximately 45 mins to 1 hr. Honestly, I don't understand how a sushi place can open its doors without being fully prepared and ready with an ingredient thats half of their menu? ESPECIALLY for a sushi restaurant! On top of that, things I ordered were not coming out. I had to reorder the items multiple times because the order either never went in or went to a different table. Service was also slow. There was only 2 servers to the whole restaurant. Within 20-30 mins it was a full house. It's not their fault for slow service. The restaurant was full and they're busy, so I understand.   All in all, this visit was a complete disappointment. Probably won't come here for a while.",

But now I recommend you steer away and find a different favorite. On several occasions (3 to be exact) my boyfriend and I have been treated like shit. After the first time I figured the girl was having a bad day, when the same waitress helped us the second time I tried to not think too much on her service, but the 3rd visit was the last straw. If you get a water or soda, expect that to be your only drink the whole time you're there. No refills. Every waiter including Amy which was ours avoids eye contact with us. When you ask for rolls they give you attitude and come out with shit you didn't even order. The employees laughed at us (like literally on us she couldn't hold it in and had to grab my shoulder for support), gave us extreme amounts of attitude, and even forgot our orders. I've never been so upset to hate a place till now. Not to mention we waited 15 minutes (yes I counted) for the check. I started to notice there were no employees while we waited for our check to leave and come to find out they're all in the corner eating sushi a whole hour and a half before they close. Are you serious??? Sushi Neko has gone down hill tbh. Do your research and find another place.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas...definitely my Nigiri #1..  Neko Service: Service was great with checking back if we wanted to order more during our AYCE dinner.  The sushi chefs were fantastic with getting our orders to the table quickly. Plates were cleared immediately and drinks were fresh all night, well done during an 80% capacity night.  Neko Sushi+: Neko is unique and popular for their rice to fish ratio of about 2:1 in terms of size with their Nigiri.  The Nigiri is good quality which makes this such a win.   Nigiri Champ: Salmon Belly, there's a reason why this order is limited per person.  They have a great variety of rolls which I limit here because I don't want to get too full for the awesome Nigiri.   My current sushi roll champ: #27 Golden Tiger = Inside: Shrimp tempura, avocado, Cream Cheese + Top: Spicy Crab with spicy mayo, yum yum & eel sauce + 3 kinds of tempura crumbs to give this roll even more gaainz.  The mini honey toast is the perfect size for me because it allows me to order another dessert to fatty up even more.  Neko ambiance:  Since my last visit 1 year+ ago, there has definitely been an upgrade!  Above is Industrial lighting, you're surrounded by Japanese pop murals, dark wood, brick walls and the plywood 'tree' makes for a fun and attractive dining area.    Service, attractive dining area and the Nigiri makes me love this Sushi Neko!  If you don't like your fish to rice ratio of 2:1 on your Nigiri, this is not a sushi house for you or you can just stick to their awesome rolls.  Freedom of choice in life and sushi is great to have, choose wisely!See you at Sushi Neko...=)",

Price: The price for sushi rolls is inexpensive and their all you can eat is a bang for your bucks!   Service and staff: The service and staff was phenomenal. They was not a time where we had to wait. The servers were very attentive and would come up to the table if they saw anyone who needed assistance. Our server Elaine was amazing and was very kind and helpful.   Atmosphere: The ambience of Sushi Neko was very modern contemporary and the music in the background was great! There was a Birthday celebration and it felt like someone hacked into the place and converted the place into a club and played happy birthday song which was cool and unique.   This will most definitely be a place where I will be going back to in future!",

    "text": "This used to be one of my \"must visit\" restaurant when I'm in town.  Not anymore.....  Came in at 10:30pm with restaurant 40% full.  Waitress told us they will do last-call at 11:20pm.  My wife and I agreed and sat down to make our AYCE order.    In the beginning orders and sides came promptly.  The presentation is a bit missing....  I joke to my wife that the \"Sushi Salad\" looked like a trash can.  It had different fish pieces raw and fried thrown on the plate.  Raw fish slices are some in rectangular slices, while others are triangular chunks.  I wasn't expecting the finest cuts for this dish, but I wish they will at least \"try\" not to make it look like the ends and sides of the unwanted parts of the fillet.  When sushi came, the fish slices look a little awkward.... when I look closer, I realize the problem..... the sashimi knifes they are using are not sharp enough.  I can't imagine this can be an actual problem at a sushi place.  Not one person know how to sharpen a knife???  This doesn't occur overnight.  We're looking at maybe at least a week of neglect with the most important tool in a sushi place.  The mackerel are not fresh looking.  The salmon are the leanest I have ever had in my life.  Now...its not easy to get this type of low quality salmon and somehow they had succeeded.  They we order the yakitori skewers.  Bacon and scallops; sausage; mushroom; garlic; and shrimps.  Last time we came, they were over salty by 300%.  This time its even more interesting..... Bacon and scallops skewers..... scallops are missing entirely.... its Bacon only skewers.  Yakitori is supposed to be skewers cooked over charcoal fire.  To save time...the kitchen threw all skewers and fried them.  Obviously, this is a complete different experience.  And really if they were too lazy, Neko could just flat out eliminated the skewers from the menu instead of creating this half-axx creation.   Finally, 11:15pm came, we were told this is the last-call.  We placed an order of tempura shrimps and mini udons.  I asked if we can order dessert later and the waitress said no, it must be done now.  Ok, fine... I ordered ice cream for dessert.  Five minutes later, waiter brought our ice creams to the table.  They sat there another 10 minutes until our last order came.  By the time we are ready for dessert, needless to say, we were almost drinking it with a straw....  Sushi Neko has a semi open kitchen.  I sat with my back facing the kitchen on this trip.  It is 11:35pm now.  The restaurant closes officially at 12am.  There are 3 tables of customers left.  All of a sudden I start hearing siesta fiesta music cranked louder.  I turned around and saw an entire hispanic kitchen crew including sushi man.  I like siesta fiesta music in the afternoon only with my tacos....but not with sushi.   Couldn't the management make sure this doesn't happen until all the customer were out?     On the way out, my wife suggested to the waitress to not bring ice cream so early.  Waitress blame it on the \"serving frig\" not cold enough to house the ice cream.  But the point is, how about, not bring it to the \"serving frig\" and leave it in the \"storing frig\" first???!  The waiter/ busboy who brought the ice creams early was just doing his job.  He sees the order entered and just fulfills it.  Its the waitress fault, who were too lazy to enter the dessert order one more time after the food order was placed.  Well, this overall experience made this the very last time we will visit Sushi Neko.  They weren't perfect before...but was good enough to come back again.  But this time, they gave us enough reason to find better sushi places elsewhere.",

Customer service sucked one particular server, Yeonjoo is very persistent about having you \"check-in\" on Yelp to redeem for a $1.50 soda. She will need to check that you posted a review before she discount your drink from check she doesn't read if the review is good or bad just as long as you post one. It's funny they will take the time to make sure you post a review before you leave but can provide exceptional service during your stay. Smh.

We visited Sushi Neko during the middle of the week for dinner.  There weren't that many people there yet so we were seated right away.  We were there for the all-you-can-eat sushi and were taken our drink orders right away.  We were starving so we also placed our food order.    The menu was extensive and there were daily specials for nigiri and hot dishes.  Our food was on our table minutes after we placed the order, which was fantastic! The fish to rice ratio, as other reviews have mentioned, was great.  They give you a big chunk of fish that can basically wrap the bottom of the rice, which is unheard of for me in Vegas.  The fish was fresh as well.    The most notable thing about Sushi Neko is the service.  Located in Chinatown, the stigma of bad and slow service is hard to ignore, but Sushi Neko's staff was attentive and quick.  Our drinks were never empty, and the server checked on us regularly.  Empty plates were taken away quickly; it was awesome.   I am definitely a fan of Sushi Neko for AYCE sushi in Chinatown.",

I had gotten hot tea and asked for sugar.  Few minutes pass, no sugar. I ask again, same thing, few minutes pass and no sugar. I asked a total of 5 times for sugar.  Finally, I stopped a completely different waitress named Jackie and I told her that I asked for sugar 5 times and no one has brought me sugar.  Jackie brought me sugar within 15 seconds of me asking her.  Thank you Jackie! You're the real MVP of Neko Sushi!",

Its about 50/50 on whether or not you get great service for that day. Either way, the sushi is worth it though! One of my favorites!",

    "text": "Best AYCE Sushi in town! First time here this evening and everything was on point. Let me get to the details...  Nice and little restaurant with cute decor and upbeat music. Clean place, and I believe it just got done being renovated few months ago. Great place for groups as their seating tables are booth/bench style. I do not really recommend strollers as they kinda get in the way as its a bit narrow between tables. High chair would be very useful here.  If you love Nigiri, this is the place for them! Great slices of fish atop a small round of rice. Portion of rice to fish ratio is perfect here. They do not cheat like other sushi joints. The best Nigiri my group enjoyed were...  Smoked paprika salmon Cajun tuna Super white tuna Salmon belly (Dinner AYCE only and by far best!) Seared lemon salmon  Appetizers were great too.. will mention my faves...  Highly recommended Pang. Its a bruschetta toast topped with scallops, crab, cheese, eel sauce, and mayo.  They have a shrimp tempura filled with cream cheese and oooh that was a hit!   When ordering sushi, don't forget that you can ask them 1/2 order so you'll have room to try other sushi. Must order sushi..  Towering sashimi (riceless) Superman (eel lovers) Orange blossom Butterfly  (peanut butter and coconut, don't let this fool you it was good) Popcorn lobster (4pcs) Lobster special (4pcs) Double dragon roll Vegas (5pcs)  Staff were awesome with service. Super great quality with the taste and plating of sushi. Been here twice within a week shows how good this place is. Definitely will make Sushi Neko my regular AYCE SUSHI restaurant!",

Knowing that this was the sister restaurant of Sakana, my expectations weren't high. This was decided by someone in our party. The atmosphere was pretty cool and all, but our overall experience was kinda sketchy.  seems like they've fooled ALOT of people with their sushi to rice ratio, but you seriously need more rice when it comes to nigiri, otherwise, JUST SERVE SASHIMI!!! Another fail is saucing anything and everything here. That's very common in Korean run AYCE sushi joints, at least in my experiences. Nigiri was a terrible mess, already not having enough rice on top of awkwardly long slices of fish...not a fan of this style at all. Some of their side dishes were pretty good though.  Cheat sheets were given to us WITH OUR TABLE NUMBERS to make ordering easier for us as well as the waitstaff, but did it help? NOPE...Plates were being delivered at the wrong tables and you would constantly hear \"Oh, we didn't order that\" throughout the evening. Take advantage of their 2 for 1 alcohol offer, you're gonna need it if you end up having a similar experience like we did.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uu  2.5",

I have been coming here atleast once or twice bi-weekly since! I've also recommended this place to so many friend, and they've fallen in love too! So good that when I went to a different sushi place, I just thought it was horrible and does not compare to Sushi Neko. At Sushi Neko, AYCE is affordable. The amount of fish over rice is so much better than many other sushi place. Their menu has great items that are part of the AYCE, such as 4 options that does not have rice! The stuffed tomato, Spicy tuna tower, oysters, pork belly, baked lobster roll, baked mussels, miso soup are just some of my favorites! This place have the best miso soup I have ever had, I always end my meal with a miso soup to push everything down. On your birthday here, they give you a free special dessert with a special presentation! It's so cool and really makes your day special! They do check your I.D. so make sure you go on your actual birthday. MUST GO TO SUSHI PLACE!!!",

Their menu had a wide variety of items so I'll just post a picture of their menu. I'd recommend trying \"The Shit\" and \"Pang\" appetizers. They have a buy 1 get 1 free/all day for alcohol. I'm a baked fan so I liked the \"wet dream\" and \"playboy\". My friend from Vegas likes this spot so we came here to catch up. I really liked this spot, can't really complain.",

    "text": "I would love to give them 5 stars but every time I've come here they have forgotten one of my rolls. Do I need the extra roll...probably not, lol but the fact that I ordered something and didn't receive it is not okay. Some people complain about the music or videos playing but if you're there to enjoy your time with someone then it really shouldn't bother you. I've only noticed the videos when a friend points out something funny that's being played. If you don't like the decor/music/videos open your own sushi spot! SOOO, the food. Man, I really appreciate their fish to rice ratio. They're by far the most generous portions I have ever had and I've tried quite a few sushi places around Vegas. The fish is really fresh and their menu is organized well. I recommend the salmon and shrimp lemon rolls. The lemon gives your mouth a refreshing feel and flavor. Definitely try \"the shit\"...no idea what's in it but it's tasty! They have this lobster roll that is to die for. Essentially, any roll with tempura (the middle row on the back of the menu) is a winner. lol. You MUST try their salmon belly. It's easily one of my favorite things to order. Their coffee mochi is surprisingly good too. It taste like coffee (obvi) but it's not over powering. It's like a cream and sugar kind of coffee taste versus a black coffee taste. I definitely recommend Sushi Neko.",

We thought we would try sushi since that's our Mom's favorite and we are so glad we found Sushi Neko. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The sushi came out fast and was really fresh. We love the all you can eat lunch special and the 2 for 1 drink specials. We were kind of skeptical getting sushi at all you can eat, but the other places nearby were closed for lunch. Turns out it was a blessing in disguise because this place was awesome!",

They don't stuff the rice like other places I've been to. 2) The fish ALWAYS tastes fresh and delicious. 3) They have a large variety of nigiri, appetizers, and rolls. For AYCE sushi, Sushi Neko is definitely the place to go!",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Decor - From the manga on the wall, to the tree made of wood planks, to the panting of the tatted geisha this place has a modern Japanese / Anime vibe        - Sakana - This place has the same owners as Sakana. You can see it in their menu items and their unique and fresh sushi.        - AYCE Premium - With most of the premium items being sashimi, this is a nice way to get more variety and give that omakase feel at an AYCE place.        - Fresh - Freshest you'll get in the desert.        - Rice - Just like Sakana, this place has a very good fish to rice ratio that won't leave you full of carbs. **Options**        - $20.95 Lunch        - $25.95 Dinner        - $28.95 Premium Dinner (Dinner + What's on the black board) **Highlights** (Rest of the things ordered are in my pictures)        - Dynamite - The presentation on the sea shell is a nice twist to a AYCE favorite.        - Power Up - Deep fried eel. Doesn't look as great, but is delicious!        - Pink Scallop - Some of the freshest and clean tasting scallops I've had.        - Premium Sashimi - The fresh wasabi on the Kampachi and the Okoda Nori on the Super White stepped up this sushi game to Iron Chef level.        - Salmon Tar Tar - Salmon sashimi with masago & some kind of cream sauce. Yes please!        - Monkey Brain - Spicy crab mix on top of a deep fried banana. The wife's favorite.        - Mini Honey Toast - Who can say no to this at the end of a meal? **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a great sushi place that has both unique rolls and fresh nigiri.",

And needless to say best quality for the price , lunch is only 20.95!!!! I am so happy we found it , same owner as Hwaro Korean BBQ across the street which is amazing too !!

Prices are as expected: 20.95$ for lunch and 25.95$ for dinner. The food was really good ! Rice to fish ratio was perfect. I enjoyed all of their appetizers , nigiri (especially unagi and housemade tamago) and agedashi tofu. However , the service can be improved. Our first server (Carlos) was fantastic and paid attention to all of our needs even for a large party. Shortly after , a different server (a woman , she never introduced herself) replaced him and service went downhill from there. She never had a nice attitude. We politely informed her that we were missing many of our orders and she got irritated at us. It was a bit nerve racking since when it was last call for orders she still forgot a lot of our orders plus we also wanted to order dessert for later. I'll stick to Sakana or Goyemon as my go-to , but the food was great here so I'll probably give Sushi Neko another try in future whenever I'm in this area.",

    "text": "Being a HUGE fan of Sakana, trying this place out was a must. What draws me back to Sakana every time is their nigiri. Unlike other sushi places, the amount of rice given is minimal in their nigiri meaning more room to eat since you're not being filled by rice. Although they do not serve sashimi here, I am not at all disappointed considering rice amounts are small. Fish was fresh..it was so good that I barely ordered any rolls and just wanted fish.   As I devoured each plate, I couldn't help but compare everything I ate to Sakana. For the most part, I would say that everything is similar. There are small differences in some, but does not significantly change the taste (still very yummy).  Also, LOVE their decor. Even their restroom was beautifully designed. Shows you how much they care about their restaurant. I will definitely be back!",

They said it was take about 30 mins to seat our party of 6, and after almost an hour later they tell us 20 more mins. They left out our last orders, guess they forgot or they really don't give a shit about their customers. My boyfriend's brother ended up getting sick after eating here.  Second time was the worst and our absolute last time. Our server literally came to our table just ONCE, and never checked up on us after that. All the girl employees suck, they never smiled so they gave bad impressions and I disliked their attitudes. We had to ask another server for our check and she had finally brought it 20 mins later. And then our original server comes back and had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert. I had started to get a really bad stomach ache halfway thru eating which is why we decided to cut our meals short. I mean no one was helping us anyways, we always had to call someone to our table. my bf even found some scales in his food like do y'all not clean your shit thoroughly?? HERE IS THE WORST PART- the first time my boyfriend's brother had gotten sick after eating here. THIS TIME, my boyfriend got sick. We put the pieces together and now we very much believe it's food poisoning from this place. He hasn't worked in almost a week because he hasn't been feeling too well after eating at Sushi Neko. I've read other reviews claiming they've gotten food poisoning here so I'm not surprised. Customer service is trash and the place and and food overall is disgusting. We eat sushi all the time at various places but this was the most traumatizing experience. Do not waste your time and money or risk your health eating here. I'd recommend Island Sushi or Oyshi.",

The shit, i ordered it 3 times it was so delicious, and coco shrimp is a new favorite! Agedashi tofu and the tempura sauces need work, not too much flavour. The atmosphere was fun and had some cute pop culture references and art painted up in the walls. For dessert I had the green tea panna cotta, light and aromatic, while my bf had some strong coffee delight. Overall, absolutely wonderful little hidden gem and will be back to try the rest of the menu!",

They were quick with orders and food. (That time, there were only two tables and four people in the restaurant).  So... I came back, again. This time, with my boyfriend. There were seven tables with a total of nineteen customers seated. They had four servers and it looks like three sushi chefs. I would have to say, it was a very disappointing experience. It was my boyfriend's first time in this place and he'll never be back again (within an hour time frame he was only able to eat two sushi rolls).   Their nigiris, particularly the salmon, tasted good. Their appetizer selections weren't as extensive as other all you can eat sushi places I've eaten in like Jjanga or Goyemon. I want to comment on the taste of their rolls but sadly, we weren't able to eat more than two because they were extremely slow with making the rolls. They are also very skimpy with the tissues and ginger slices.   Customer service wise... I think they were very friendly people. I just feel bad for the front line employees because they are the ones who have to experience the customers' anger and dissappointment in regards to their sushi and other orders being made very slowly.   I think this place shouldn't be an all you can eat place. Their sushi chefs can't handle the influx of people and orders (that's just with nineteen customers and you can already heavily feel the slowness in making the orders). Apparently, they know about the slowness in making the rolls but haven't found a way to remedy it. I hope they will find a solution. They aren't a bad restaurant just very ill prepared for the type of restaurant they chose to be.  Thus... if you ever do decide to try Sushi Neko... I would suggest that you come during a time when they are completely not busy. Furthermore, just order nigiri sushis. Don't order the rolls. If you do order the rolls... do expect a very long wait.",

All you can eat is best price we have found and their food quality is amazing. The guys making the sushi really care about their plates and made us an extra appetizer of their \"favorite\" just to let us try something different. This place is BADASS! If you go, you will have a life changing experience. If you choose not to go, well, your life will just plain suck. Don't be a chump, come to Neko and enjoy buy one get one free alcohol all open hours and the best DAMN SUSHI OF YOUR ENTIRE PUNY EXISTANCE. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!",

Their pieces are exceptionally large compared to other locations. Service was quick and they also gave us an extra cake for dessert for the birthday boy.

They definitely upgraded though because they had some cool decorations and artwork! The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice.   The service was excellent as they were attentive (or because we were seated right by the kitchen) but overall they checked up on us and the bussers kept refilling our hot tea and water ( a total plus for me)   Do me a favor and order the oysters, white tuna, fresh water eel, and seared paprika salmon nigiri.",

If you're looking for food, this is definitely not the place to be; almost inedible.  The service was \"decent\" in the beginning until the incident with my \"Salmon Nigiri\". The nigiri still had a bone in it which slit a small cut in my gums when I bit into it. I told the waitress as it was a safety hazard and she said \"I'll ask the chef.\" As I watched her walk up to the kitchen counter as it is an open kitchen where everyone can see, she goes up and does the fastest 180 turn I've ever seen and walked away from the kitchen as if I never asked. After that she never walked up to our table again.   Will NEVER be coming back.",

It's worth it because the world needs to know about great sushi when you find it especially in Las Vegas where there are so many bad sushi places!

If you're going to eat a lot, it would be wise to get the All you can eat price.   Like Korean BBQ, the price depends on the day and time. So, make sure you research the price if you are on a budget or you want the cheaper option.  The place use to be a Japanese restaurant, but it's a Sushi place.  The decorations are really nice and aesthetically pleasing to look and enjoy.  From the times I've been there, they would play Korean music~  They also have TVs around the place.  The last time I was there, they were playing the anime movie, Millennium Actress. I haven't seen that movie in years. I recommend watching it. They also played videos from Youtube about food or Japanese culture.  Along with other sushi places in Las Vegas, they have interesting names for some of their sushi.  They have names based of Super Heroes like Wonder Woman and the Hulk.  They also had sushi name after K-pop groups.  While they were playing Blackpink's music, I notice they actually had a roll named Blackpink.  The staff were all nice and efficient with taking our orders and serving them promptly.  Lately, I really been into Salmon, So I ordered a lot of rolls that had Salmon.  My friends ordered other sushi like Tuna, Yellowtail, and White Tuna.  All the food was delicious and it's a nice place to visit for some good sushi.",

Edit #1:  They forgot my orders :(  Edit #2:   They can't refill the water and it's 110 degrees.. there's no AC, the food is good and spicy but we're still dying in this heat.  Where's the AC? :( someone working really should turn it on. When we did get our food they just put it on the table and didn't tell us what was what.    Edit #3:  No one is checking up on us now :( #forgotten.  We don't have anyone even walking to us anymore  Edit #4:  When you have to raise your hand to get the attention of your waitress but ended up raising your hand for 5 minutes. #awkward  Edit #5 After waiting for 15 mins our waitress didn't come back for our check so we had to walk to the front to pay.  At the end of our meal we didn't get our deserts that we ordered and we asked to see a manager but the cashier said that she didn't want us to talk to the manager because they would get busted.",

All sushi we ordered was delicious, my fave were the lemon salmon and lemon shrimp rolls they were exquisite, mouth watering!   We had some appetizers, my fave was \"THE SHIT\" I have no idea what it was, but it was really the shit lol.    It's hard for me to do this, but I'm knocking it down .5 stars due to the poor service.  The worst thing is that it is not the waiters fault, they really try their best with what they have.  There were 3 workers, Saturday night, AYCE serving as both waiters/host.  Hope the owners ease on their workers a bit and hire addtl staff.  You'll love the decoration!",

When I needed something and my server was busy , other servers where right there to take care of every need . These guys own this place and Wharo Korean bbq. Wharo is my favorite AYCE Korean in town . Must try spot. If you're the picky sushi customer that does not do AYCE because of quality, this place will change your outlook on AYCE .",

    "text": "This is my favorite sushi spot in Vegas hands down, and let me tell you why!!  I always go here but a few days ago, I took my family to go eat here for my Mom's birthday and I have to say, everything was on point that night.  Back story, we were trying to find a Hibachi place to eat at and drove all over town in search of one but there was either a long wait or something just didn't strike us to commit to one so I decided let's go to a place we trust. Sure enough, we ended up at Sushi Neko lol As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted and I guess I've been here so many times, the server recognized me and said, \" Hey, how are you?!\" That was awesome. And got seated immediately. Not to mention, this place was already pretty busy to begin with. We ordered a ton of food for AYCE between the 3 of us: 4 orders of Salmon Nigiri and 3 orders of Eel Nigiri along with 3 Miso Soups, 2 orders of Shrimp Tempura and 2 orders of \"The Shit\" (highly recommend) just to start off. We added a few rolls and more Nigiri along the way but not once did we wait more than 3 minutes for our food. Like I said, they were ON POINT  If you like Nigiri, this place is NUMBER ONE. Huge fish portions and tastes so fresh, especially their Salmon mmmm. It just melts in your mouth.  Customer service was so attentive and friendly. Our server always checked up on us during a comfortable amount of time, refills frequently, and empty plates were taken.  They also did a nice surprise celebration for my Mom with a very delicious and decorative dessert that contained Deep Fried Ice Cream and a couple halves of Mochi Ice Cream with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle.  If I could give this place 6 stars for that night, I would. We all walked out of there completely satisfied.",

I understand when it's busy, but at one point we were sitting there for 30 minutes, waiting for our food and no one came by to check-up on us or refill our waters.  They also missed some orders. This didn't only happen to us, but the table next to us was also missing some of their orders.   In the end, they forgot some of our desserts but we were all getting tired of waiting so we just paid and left.  The food was ok, nothing that really stood out to me.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",

    "text": "We recently moved to Vegas and have been trying different sushi places around town, and THIS is by far our favorite. The AYCE menu is reasonably priced and so worth it. It includes almost their entire menu, except for rice less rolls, and a few nigiri options, none of which I normally eat anyway. We came for lunch on a Friday around 2, and arrived just as the lunch rush was ending. If you show up during rush, there's usually about a 40 minute plus wait the waitress said. For the appetizers we got gyoza, shrimp tempura, and pork belly (my husbands fave). Then salmon, yellowtail, albacore, shrimp, and crab nigiri, all delicious. And there's more meat than rice! I had two of their hand rolls, both were delicious, and we had several half orders of the rolls on their menu. I love that they give you the option of only doing a half roll (4 pieces).  I can't say enough great things about this place, the service was also great. We will definitely be back! Most likely, within the week!",

Very relaxing and not so rush feeling. I would let other friends come here to see this place if they come to visit LAS VEGAS. Must check out this place.",
