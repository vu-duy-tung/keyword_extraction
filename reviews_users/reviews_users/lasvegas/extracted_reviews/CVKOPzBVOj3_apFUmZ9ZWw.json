    "text": "I want to be fair about my experience here, I would give the food 5 stars but my dining experience a 1... maybe 2. I wish I had taken time to research the place before taking my family and visiting father-in-law for lunch after a go-round on the high roller. I checked the yelp score, saw it said good for kids: yes... away we went. Upon arrival I realized this was not a restaurant but more of a fast food joint, I hesitated but my FIL loves seafood and my husband gave me his nod of approval so we went ahead and ordered. The food was amazing, probably among the best fried fish I've ever had. I had a fish combo with Dirty chips #2 (truffle, chives &parmesan.) Husband had shrimp and dirty chips #1 (chipotle, chorizo and jalapeno.) Kids and Pops had fish and plain fries. What was not great, there is almost no seating. 3-4 tables total and the rest is a small area of bar counters inside and out. It was cold and windy out, so we ended up sitting outside with our 2 kids (2 & 5) scarfing down our $65 of fish and cold fries. Napkins and plastic flatware blowing away in the wind. Also, they don't have trays, so try getting drinks and cartons of food for 5 people without trays ... it was a challenge. There's only one digital (Ie: very complicated) drink machine, extremely impractical with people lining up behind you while you're trying to get drinks for multiple people. So, to be fair - I feel like it's partly my fault for not properly vetting this place. Had the weather been nice, I don't think we'd have minded as much. But if the weather sucks, or if you're with a group and have small kids - this is basically a glorified food stand. Be advised.",

Mine was edible but I left probably a third of it chewed up on my plate. To tough, grisly or both to fully chew up. What a disappointment because we were looking forward to eating there. No one ever came by and asked how our food was or anything else after the food was delivered. I'm thinking Ramsey maybe should make sure this place is purchasing a good grade of beef. Pretty crappy presentation for a $50 steak. Most definitely not worth it. We won't be back.",

Didn't realize it was fast food-not a sit down restaurant and the facility was filthy, filthy, filthy.  $16 for three little 2oz pieces of soggy fried fish and soggy fries. I ordered the shrimp and fries and once again, the batter very soggy.  When the guy poured the beer, it was about 3\" shy of the top of the plastic cup which, didn't sit well with us from the git-go. Unless ole Gordo thinks he can get by forever on his name, I would suggest he change his business model, clean the place and get kids in that know how to fry cook.  Like I said, very disappointing.  Would not recommend...",

I thought Gordon Ramsay's fish was excellent, nice and flaky, but the batter had no flavor and it was horribly greasy. I think the oil wasn't quite hot enough because our fish was almost dripping with grease. I'm not a health nut: I liked fried food but I don't like excessive grease. In Long Beach, CA we have a much better fish & chip place called, Roe. Also, Oceanside, CA has a much better place called Harbor Fish & Chips.",

They also offer wine and beer at this restaurant, which is a nice touch although might be a little expensive. If you're a Ramsay fan like me, they also have merchandise available so you can rep!",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas my friend said she had a taste for some fish.  We were waking around the Linq Promenade and saw Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips.  We decided to give it a try.   The food was just OK, I think people expect this fish to be like made out of gold or something because it has his name on it.  It was fish and it was fairly good.  I somehow can't give a piece of fried cod a five star review.  It's hard to find a place to sit.  My friend waited for someone to leave to grab two seats while I ordered my food and then we switched once she secured two seats.  The counter area where we sat was not kept up.  It was sticky and very wet from either spilled drinks or being wiped and not dried off.  The floor was sticky when walking on it.  The garbage can was overflowing.  I was not impressed.  I get that maybe you should grab your food and eat outside somewhere but it's not like there is outdoor seating either.  I think they need to hire someone just to keep up with keeping the area where people eat clean enough so you don't mind sitting there.  When my shoes stick to the floor because of sticky spills it makes for an unpleasant dining experience.  I think Mr. Ramsay would have a screaming fit if he saw how this place was kept up.  Yes, I know the turnover in people walking In and out of there all day makes it tough, but a designated upkeep person is mandatory!   I was turned off by that whole scenario.  Come on Mr. Ramsay, get your establishments together to make eating at your restaurant a nicer experience.",

I would have it again in a heartbeat. My husband had the shrimp. The shrimp were very large and had a flavorful batter. He really enjoyed them   We both ordered our fries \"dirty\" - I tried the bacon-bacon cheddar and my husband tried the chipotle/jalapeno/chorizo toppings. When we got our food at first, the staff made a mistake and our fries were not covered as requested. When we got them back, there were some toppings at the bottom of each of our trays and there wasn't enough to cover the fries. If I could give any advice, I wouldn't waste money on the dirty fries.   Sauces were good and the food was fresh. We would come back.",

There is very little seating inside and outside, where everyone in Vegas is walking by smoking cigarettes, though we lucked out getting a couple of stools that my husband sat at while I stood in line waiting to order. While waiting in line, which moved at a steady pace, you can see fish and fries being cooked constantly, to keep up with the constant orders. Our order of fish and chips came with two of the five offered sauces. We chose the Southwest, being from Albuquerque,  and Gordon Ramsays Tarter. It was less than a five minute wait after ordering, paying, and getting our number.  The fish was hot, fresh, crisp, perfectly battered and cooked atop crispy, hot, salted french fries. The southwest sauce was good, though I couldn't tell you what was in it. I'm sorry Gordon but I've had better tarter, actually at an Irish Pub in ABQ,  called Two Fools.  When we were there, the line was to the door and people were annoyingly crossing back and forth through the line to get to the drink station and condiments.",

The cod just melts and is soo juicy.  I cannot empathize how ON-POINT everything is. The amount of \"chips\" or fries was plentiful and way more than what you need. Excellent pub food. My friend ordered the chicken, but they gave her fish, (she doesn't eat fish) they comped us the fish, because they were going to throw it away anyway. They made it right and gave us the proper order. OH MY GOD.. the chicken was seasoned and soo juicy ! I've never had fried chicken that was this good!   We Tried the sticky toffee shake .. jeeez ! It was soo good! But don't 'order one by yourself unless you want diabetes. ITs really sweet and over the top. I still love it though! I am totally a fan!!!",

    "text": "Another Gordon Ramsay project. After being heavily disappointed with BurGR, I thought 10 times before giving into the Fish and Chips...  Appearance: Pretty stereotypical \"British\" decor. A 12 year old could of designed it after watching an episode of Eastenders. A sure tourist magnet.  The service softly spoke \"I'm currently applying to other jobs\" but it got it done.   Fish: Not bad. When compared to the last spot where I had fish and chips...Codmothers in SF, I would give this the edge...you can actually taste the fish. It was not heavily battered (+)   and  Chips: They were warm, lightly seasoned and tasty to dip in your fish sauce.   So Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips is not exactly going for an award, but they appeal to the masses and serve up a decent portion of fish and chips. If you want to brag about trying a Gordon Ramsay spot then I would get it over with here. There are way better steaks and burgers without his name stamped on them in Vegas.",

OVERALL: recommend if you're looking for a quick bite!  Pros: -fish was very fresh (however it wasn't MIND BLOWING which is why its not a 5 star review) -sauces were delicious -fell apart every time i tried to eat with a fork  Cons: -very limited seating",

But the details finishing up the genuinely flaky and juicy fish and excellently-fried-texture chips were fantastic to see. The Ramsay Fish & Chips logo is even on the lemon skewer. And they cut out the center pith so the lemon squeezes its juice better. (Of course--we went for the malt vinegar instead.)   I give it 4.5 stars for what it is, with half a star deduction because the fish needs to be seasoned a little better under the batter so the fish flavor is a bit more pronounced. It was a touch bland even though juicy and flaky with an excellent fried batter.",

I lived in England for a little bit over a year, so I've had my fair share of this iconic dish. So trust me when I say Gordon Ramsay fucking slayed it with this restaurant. Star of the show--the glorious battered cod--crisped to perfection with a tender, moist texture. Don't forget the fish's sidekick, the chips, which might actually outshine its counterpart. It's all about the seasoning, so get your chips with garlic or a bit of spice...you name it. But I die for the seemingly endless selection of sauces, which elevates this dish to the next level.",

Got the most famous item, the fish and chips. Comes with two sauces. The fries were normal tasting fries. No complaints there. The fish was great. Very soft and lots of flavor. It was very crispy. Didn't need the sauce as it had plenty of taste. Two people can share this item; for one person it would be too much.   Eat outside while facing the linq promenade crowd. Perfect for people watching. Great food and good view; can't get better than that.",

Impressed the chefs knew the type of fry oil was canola! (And not \"vegetable oil\", that's actually soybean oil.)   It was really odd that the \"out\" door was locked, making the flow of traffic, while holding food, uncomfortable.   The only sauce that remotely sounded good to me was the curry mango, which unfortunately looked like mustard and had a slight scent of vinegar, which I don't like for anything other than cleaning windows. It was very bland, I actually didn't think the curry mango sauce tasted like much of anything and my favorite meal is curry! I have very sensitive taste buds, so I expected the sauce to be excellent, which is why I'm knocking off a star. No good sauces for the fish and chips. Hell, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce would have been better than any of the choices. Or even maple syrup would have been better. LOL   Portion size was perfect.",

This restaurant was the least expensive, so this was the one we tried. My boyfriend and I shared a fish and chip meal, was perfect amount as a snack for us to share, and we were pleasantly surprised. It was really good, from the fish to the tarter sauce. Didn't like that they had a Pepsi machine, although it was one of the ones that lets you pick from a bunch of flavors. Coke machine would have been bomb with the meal. Anyway, seems clean, staff was nice and the food was delivered fairly quickly. Will return and will try another restaurant next time we're in Vegas.",

I was hoping the fish and chips worse the money I spent.   The fish was well cooked that it was not dry at all. The outer layer was very crispy! It came with 2 dressings. I chose tar tar sauce, and curry mango (took the risk of curry mango). The curry mango was surprisingly refreshing with a little bit of spicy flavor!   The chips were toward the crispy side, which was what I like! Love my meal here.  Sittings are limited (both indoor and outdoor). Line could be long during lunch time.",

Who would have thought that simple fish and chips can impress so much. The fish had a thin super crispy coating and it was soft and perfectly cooked from inside. But those chips/fries was what took away the show.  We have had some great fries and I never thought that someone can make them better and this place did it. They were the best fries we have ever had period. The fries had this amazing crunch that I have never experienced before. We got the truffle fries and as soon as we got our order I could smell the truffle. The fries had fresh permesian, parsley and I still find hard to believe but it looked like actual bits of preserved truffle. Now when ever I come to Vegas it will always be on top of my list.",

Box comes with just 2 sauces, if you're a dunker you'll definitely require more than two.

The fries were some of the better I have had.  Some of the sauces were good, some just so-so. Gordon's tarter sauce was pretty good, curry and mango was very nice, southwest ranch was so-so, and Sriracha aioli was nice but not outstanding.  Like so much of Vegas anymore the prices are high for what you get. But I will admit that compared to other places this is a little less than average for a meal.

If this food was cooked by someone on one of his contestant shows, he'd be freaking out, throwing one of his temper tantrums, cussing up a storm & screaming at whoever cooked it.  The fish was almost entirely breading, which was completely bland.  It wasn't even cooked all the way through... the breading was soft & mushy.  The fries were cold... & not cold like they just weren't piping hot, but they were actually cold... like they'd been sitting there for 20/25 minutes before being served.  Last, & the most egregious, the beer was warm... the fries were colder than the beer, so you can't even wash this crap down after you eat it.  My wife & I took about 3-4 bites before tossing it in the trash... our 12 year old & his friend made it thru around 6 bites before tossing it.  Usually I make my kid finish his food, but I couldn't inflict this on him anymore after we tossed ours.  Save yourself the money & seek out a Long John Silver's if there's any left.",

This is the second best fish n chips I've had, coming in right behind a legendary place in Victoria, Canada. Anyhow this place is another one of Gordon's non-reservation eat ins.   About a 15-20 minute wait . The wait isn't too bad but seating is pretty cramped! Ideally you'd be able to sit comfortably in a nice air conditioned spot to enjoy Gordon's fresh-out-the-fryer fish . But you'll most likely stuff your face with fish in a cramped corner or outside in the blistering Vegas heat (if in summer). None of that takes from the deliciousness though. Perfectly cooked, flaky fish with great dipping options   Avoid the lemonade. It looks really good on the menu but I had to return mine cause it was way too sweet. Other reviews seem to agree. Just get the fish and maybe a brew!",

So we stroll across this restaurant Had no idea it was there. And after a big dinner with his parents, we decide to go in anyway. (I mean its Gordon F-ing Ramsay we HAVE to try his food) So we go in full as ever and order the chicken and fries. I swear my husband had a drunk epiphany He is half mexican and white and the fact that the fries had burnt chorizo on them to enhance their flavor seriously blew his mind. It was a great experience. The service is great! the people who work there probably see drunk people stumbling in all the time so they know how to take care of us. I'm sure it is a fun people watching job.. very clean restaurant and I seriously cannot wait to go back.",

Points for light crispy batter and flaky fish but otherwise the taste isn't going to blow you away. And I spent $20 for my lunch which is not something I do everyday. Maybe if I'm in the area again (I'm a local) I'll try again and be more adventurous. For now, not a must stop for you tourists.",

There was a lot of them though.   Hubby had a fish combo and I tried a piece of his fish, outstanding.  Really tasty.   Reason for 3 stars is it wasn't as great as I was expecting and it cost $30 for a fish combo, a portion of chips and a Miller lite.  I didn't think the $$ matched the experience.   I may grab a portion of chips if we're up the strip and bar hopping but I would make a special trip to go here.",

The staff, particularly the guy who took our order, Alex, oozed friendliness and was so upbeat - taking our order with a smile on his face. In addition, the food was very quick and was out shortly after I grabbed my soda.  The plain fish & chips dipped in the southwest ranch sauce was FABULOUS!!! The batter was crispy, the fish was absolutely stunning, and the fries were so tasty!  Also, the decor and style of the restaurant was flawless and gave it a comfortable fun vibe. I will undoubtedly come back here again and again.",

Line was almost to the door, moving slowly w/1 terminal open, when a call from manager prompted \"extra\" employee to work the line noting orders to speed things up. Otherwise seemed like a well-oiled machine, as most were getting fish & chips. Watched them preparing hand battered fish, & fries; placing in ~15 prepared individual baskets so all they had to do was add your two choices of sauces. Once I paid for my order it was ready in about 2 minutes. Speeding up the order taking by making patrons decide before they get to the register really helped the line. I upgraded the included soft drink to a Coors Light for $5-really hit the spot! 3-piece Cod & regular chips, quite good, not excessively oily. Chips had a proper texture. A variety of sauces to choose from, but as a purist, I got two tartar. Found a seat outside so could do some people-watching while I enjoyed a leisurely dinner.",

The Southwest tartar has just enough kick to be my fave. I squeezed the lemon wedge over my fish and I was in fried food heaven, where there is no cholesterol and no high blood pressure.

Went for Father's Day because husband been bugging about this fish and chips about 4months now; so I though okay it's Father's Day let's take him there! And he's a huge fans of fish and chips. Me on the other hand. I can deal with it but I probably won't enjoy it as much! But here is the thing! They have shrimp and chips!!!! Which is WAY WAY DELICIOUS!!!! It's exceptional!! And just perfect! And I would go back for the shrimp and chips!!!   Additional note on the dipping sauce; I tried the mango curry and I thought it was just ok! I couldn't really taste the contrast taste it's supposed to have, or the way it meant to be! But their cocktail sauce was pretty delicious! You just have to ask for it because it's not on the menu.",

This is a not a sit down restaurant but as we passed by, the line was long. If people are willing to wait for food when there are hundreds and hundreds of dining options, well we had to try it.   The line is long because food is cooked to order. We met some fun people in line and the framed video maker on the wall was entertaining. When it was our turn to order we got the standard fish and chips box but chose the truffle Parmesan chips.   Seating is very limited but I was able to snag some stools outside so we can people watch. There is some great people watching outside of this place.   As for the food, probably one of the best fish and chips I've ever had. The batter was a perfect golden brown, flaky fresh white fish and the box we ordered was enough for two to enjoy.    Very happy with our dining choice that evening. Wish there were more seating options but in that area, I could see why it isn't possible.",

I think it could have used just a touch more salt is my only negative comment, just slightly though. The fries were a special treat as they too were hot and cooked to a golden crispy finish. Gordon's tartar sauce was delicious. It almost tasted like a creamy malt vinegar with dill. One of the best tartar sauces I have had. I will also add that service was fast, I expected it to take a while, it didn't! They are very friendly and quick. Enjoyed the entire experience and $15 which included a soda drink vs $30 at Caesar's! Good find highly recommended! Enjoy!",

The fish combo came with 3 pieces of fish, seasoned chips, dipping sauce, and a fountain drink for around $15. Don't let the long line discourage you because it moves fast with great service. My DH said it was the best fish and chips he has ever eaten and I agree. We left stuffed for about $35 for lunch. This is a definite stop for some good comfort fries fish and chips.",

The mango curry dipping sauce was not favorable, and the Sticky Toffee milkshake almost undrinkable. There was no British beer on the menu--only domestic. Hubby enjoys food but left most of it.

The line did move along quickly as I waited in line to get my food longer than I did to actually order.   The menu is very practical and to the point. Husband and I both did their classic famous menu item, the fish and chips with a side of plan fries. You can upgrade your fries to several kind on the menu, we did not. Your dish automatically comes with tarter sauce and an extra sauce. If you wish to add any others, it's an extra 50 cents. Also included in the cost is your drink which is great! Huge soda fountain so you can add flavors like cherry or vanilla and mix things up.  The fish was so crispy and light it had to be the best fish I've had in a very long time.. we both couldn't get over how great the fries were, something about them were just absolute perfection! I could have these fries everyday for a snack if I was in heaven! Plus I got the aioli sauce which made them even better for dipping!  Everything was great here including their very british decor both inside and out! Only negative thing is I wish they had more seating!",

    "text": "Well, no surprise that I had to visit a second restaurant bearing the Gordon Ramsay name in Las Vegas. The nice thing is this place is more of a cheaper fast food restaurant that his other ventures. So you don't have to shell out more than 20 per person. For perspective, my appetizer alone at Hell's Kitchen was more than my entire Fish and Chips with a drink and taxes.   I ended up ordering the namesake of the Restaurant, Fish and Chips. I went at 8 PM, which could have been during the rush and impacting the quality on why it got a 3 star.  Let's start with the pros. The restaurant is designed well and has the flair I would expect from GR himself. This is probably your best bet to try his food without breaking the bank. In addition, the cod was both flaky and the batter shatter crispy, while staying light at the same time.   What knocked them down to 3 stars was purely on taste. I did an upgrade to the truffle fries, although perfumed with it...it was missing salt. I would also say that the fish lacked salt. As GR would say, \"Oh my God, it's bland...WHERE's the SALT!?!\" Having said that, everything was always made to order and they were SLAMMED at 8 PM when I went, so maybe that could have caused the issue with seasoning. Regardless, I don't think they were to GR's standards.  Overall, it's a great concept, but would recommend catching a few salt packets before you leave the joint in case you have the same experience.",

    "text": "Bloody good fish and chips! Usually I'm hesitant on \"chef branded\" establishments because price goes up, quality goes down, excuse is because of the \"name\" - but glad to have been proven wrong! This place is LEGIT.  Strolled in on a Saturday afternoon, managed to get a table for all 6 of our group. Seating is a little tight on the inside for big groups like ours, but if you're 2-4 people it shouldn't be a problem. They also have bar-style seating outside for small groups as well.   The line and ordering is very straight forward. Bonus! While wait, you can see the chefs cook your fish and chips from the initial breading to the deep frying. I love to see an open kitchen concept. You also get two selections of sauces. Between all 6 of us, we managed to get one of every sauce to try. Top picks: Curry, Dijon Mayo, and Gordon's Tartar sauce. I personally got the Dijon Mayo (think mustard plus mayo!) and the tartar sauce, of course. Curry was a nice flavor without being overpowering. The others were meh in my book (in comparison to the top choices) - but don't get me wrong, all the sauces were all really tasty.  Fish & Chips - 5/5. So damn good. Good fish and chips in my book need to be flakey, but hold it's shape when you bite & dip into the sauces. The batter should be light, but not over power the taste of the mild fish. Gordon Ramsey manages to accomplish both these things. Bite after bite, the fish flaked apart but didn't fall apart into the sauce. The batter was crisp and had so much flavor. Natural fries were a great compliment tossed simply with salt. Definitely grab a beer to go with this!  Shrimp & Chips - 4/5. Slightly too much batter, but still damn good. My partner got the shrimp, which were HUGE. This combo came with 5 pieces of rather large shrimp battered the same as the fish. However, my partner thought the batter was a little much for the shrimp. Maybe a less thick batter would do better? I had no complaints though as the shrimp was plump, tasty, and the batter tastes amazing.  Fried food is done best when you bite into it and the insides don't just fall from the coating. Both the fish and shrimp held shape but remained so tender - a good sign of fried food done very well. I would come back here in a heartbeat. Very simple and well made food.",

Located in the LINQ Promenade, it's a great addition to the Strip.   The restaurant is a bit small, so there was a bit of a wait. If you have a larger party, definitely need to scout of some seats if you are planning on eating it there.   My girlfriend and I shared the Fish & Chip Combo w/ Gordon's Tartar Sauce and Dijon Mayonnaise. There were a few other sauce options, but they seemed a bit out of the park for us.   FYI: Water cup is $0.50, really...?  The presentation looks great, comes in a little box. We were starving so we went right into it. The fish was amazing, super crispy outside, soft and flaky inside, fries are great. I think one combo to share with two people is perfect, otherwise, it does get a bit heavy. Definitely worth a try!",

There's just the right amount of batter and frying. I was starving, so I also ordered three pieces of fish, which the lady totally upsold me like nobody's business. She did a great job. Don't expect a pristine dining experience as this is, after all, fast food. Enjoy!",

I made the fried dirty (added truffle parmesan) the cashier didn't inform us that it will be $2 (I expected the charge anyway, so no surprise) but when I asked for 2 water cups, I was charged $0.48 each. I also get the beer with the meal for $4 extra. The total comes out to be around $24 for 1 serving. The food tho... one of the fish was undercooked, the fried was soggy and the seasoning was very bland. Overall, food was extremely greasy. luckily we only ordered 1 meal for me to share with my husband. My friends tho, they threw away the rest of their food (half portion). If you want to try it, go ahead. This place is pretty much a tourist trap. Sorry Gordon, but I still love you.",

Tip alert: if you're choosing between the fish and chips and the fish sandwich, get the fish and chips. It comes with one more piece of cod and the only difference is that it's not wrapped in pita bread with some tomatoes for I believe the same price. The fish is nevertheless so good and hot and makes you happy. You get to choose from two dipping sauces and I tried the sriracha mayo, the mango curry, and the regular tartar sauce. The best one of the three was the sriracha so I would recommend that one. Excellent choice for a quick lunch at the Linq - would not hesitate to return!",

However, GR Fish & Chips is the real deal!  Located on the Linq promenade is the small British looking pub facade that has a small outdoor seating area. Inside is simply a walk up counter to order your fish & chips and take it with you.  My experience with the product was spot on!  The fish was fabulous and well proportioned, the fries were sea salt and crispy enough on the exterior!  The accompanying tartar sauce and spicier sauce was extraordinary and made the meal just extraordinary!   GR has this restaurant of his doing exactly what you'd see the celebrity chef expecting on one of his many shows.  Producing a excellent quality fish & chips served in a great \"people watching\" location just off the strip!",

My favorite is the sausage because of the seasoning. I also highly recommend their \"Dirty Fries\", the truffle parm are my favorite but the jalapeno and chorizo is a close second.   You also have to try the fresh brewed lemonades. So refreshing on those hot summer days when everything feels like it's melting.   The one bad thing about this place is the lack of seating.

I mean, you see Gordon Ramsay yelling on TV like he's some hot sh*t and it turns out... he totally is.  The batter on the fish was so evenly crispy on the outside, and slightly soft on the inside. The fish was so fluffy and juicy that it actually started to fall apart (the way tender meat falls off bone) as I was eating it. The fish tasted great with no sauce, but I did enjoy experimenting with the different dipping options. I'd say 2 orders split between 3 people would be the perfect amount of food. Definitely come here if you're in Vegas and in the mood for a cheap (by Vegas standards), delicious meal.",

It's located on the Linq promenade, which offers a good variety of bars and restaurants if you're having trouble deciding on where to eat. It was a rather chilly evening when I came with a few of my friends, so even though they had heaters outside on the patio we opted to sit inside. The place was packed and we had to hover around to wait for someone to leave to find a place to sit. I did enjoy the food though, $15.99 for a fish and chip combo and your choice of two sauces. Great for if you're with a group, everyone can just go to the counter and order separately. I was pretty happy with the quality of food, and they offer malt vinegar by the drink fountain if you're not content with the sauce choices.",

The fish was lightly battered, that crisped up perfectly, flaky, and delicious. With the combo you get 3 good-sized pieces of fish. The chips were crispy, salty tastiness. Malt vinegar and European style mayonnaise enhanced the meal. The Guinness was good, but poured with no head. Seating is limited, but that's to be expected at a take away. As I ate, the line to get in grew, but moved fairly quickly. In all I was thoroughly pleased and would definitely come back.",

After eating at burgr at planet Hollywood and Gordon Ramsey Steak at the Paris hotel which both of these experiences were excellent, this was not anywhere near Gordon's standards. I ordered the fish and chips. Fair price for the food you get. The batter tasted good but the fish itself had no flavor!! Very bland. The \"chips\" were your average French fry, i expected a more authentic \"chip\". I also got sick from the fish, not sure why but I had a stomach ache and bloating for a day after eating here and that was not pleasant to be sick while on vacation.   I always eat fish and I'm not allergic to it so I'm not sure if it was a fluke or I actually got food poisoning from the fish. They also forgot my order. I was number 371 and all of a sudden they are calling 372...373... etc. finally I went to ask the seemingly annoyed order filler and he tried to tell me to wait but I had to speak up and say you missed my order. The cashier was nice and helpful. The people filling the orders and cooking, they all looked pissed off. Yeah they were busy but them all looking mad didn't help the ambience and the guy handing out the orders seemed annoyed to say the least.  This place is not up to Gordon Ramsey's standards or has he just finally sold out? I will never go back here I am sad to say. Sorry Gordon but I am sending you to your room because this place should not have your name on it,  bloody hell man it's more the level of a Long John Silvers.",

We each got a piece of fish and upgraded our fries to the dirty number 1 which includes chorizo, jalapenos, aioli and some other delicious things. That's the good news...the bad news is the main dish... the entree, unfortunately this was a major let down as I was really looking forward to trying this and I love fish but this again was a major disappointment.  The fish was extremely bland no seasoning and flavorless if the fries, a side dish, are better than the main course something's wrong.  While this place gets many stars and the place was definitely packed I'm unsure as to what all the hype is.  Best sellers include the upgraded fries, their in house lemonade with ginger and their different dipping sauces, one visit is enough for me.",

A must try is the Sriracha aioli, curry mango and tartar sauce. The European style mayo was ok but I wouldn't get it again. Fish was a little soft inside so it was hard to dip it. I used a knife to spread the sauce on the fish instead. Fairly small restaurant with limited seating inside and some outside. Nice looking restaurant inside and out.",

Forget about the fish and chips at Ramsay Pub inside Caesars for $30; this $15 combo puts it to shame. Lemonade and shakes are also pretty good. A long line goes fast and the staff here works hard. They should be allowed to have a tip jar out.   It's part of Total Rewards as well so you can get tier credits or pay with points. I eat here minimum once a week sometimes more and its the same every time. Smaller pieces of fish but its enough food for sure.   A little greasy but it's fish and chips so we know that going in. Everything is still really crispy and they are using quality fish and ingredients. If you need something quick and under $20 on the strip GRFC is an easy pick.  Would get full 5 stars if they didn't have jam packed overflowing full trash cans all the time but I recognize the place is very busy. Also curious what kind of cooking oils they are using. Maybe I don't want to know!",

Dying to try the one at Paris but it's too expensive so maybe one day when I'm celebrating something really special.   So we decided to stop here because my dad's a ramsay fan too as well as a huge lover of a good plate of fish & chips. Service was friendly & quick while my dad asked about the types of sauces & what you can order. He settled on 2 pieces & just the tartar sauce & ketchup. When he ate it he kept raving about how it was perfect! Crispy on the outside & how fish should be on the inside. Now normally I don't eat a lot of fish, I'm not a fan, but the way he kept talking about it I had to try it. He wasn't lying! I liked it & I think I might even get myself a plate one time. Fries were really tasty too ! Not too salty & very flavorful ! Gordon ramsay doesn't disappoint! Now I really can't wait to try his other restaurants.",

We'd already been to GR Steak which was amazing, so there was no reason to expect subpar anything on our food tour.   Unfortunately, the Fish and Chips restaurant is a total rip off. It's a tiny space with minimal seating, so we had to sit outside and get crapped on my pigeons. The interior also smelled like sour milk because of all the tartar sauce in the trash. Food-wise, it pains me to say this, but the little fish and chips place by my house makes better fish AND chips. The batter was flavorless and only mildly crispy, the 4 sauces we tried were bland, and the fries were 75% soggy.   So, in summary, the food would have been passable if it cost $20; however, it cost $40, and did not deserve having his name attached to it. The restaurant itself was tiny and smelly too. Sorry Gordon!",

As I said earlier its pretty teensy, so I wouldn't come with large group. There was several people waiting for us to get up. I liked the decor tried they kept it simple and clean, with an English pub vibe.  The menu was minimalistic, but I like that they had plenty of sauce selections. I had the Siracha Aioli and the European Style Mayo. The breading on the fish was wonderful. Super crispy. The beer batter really came through. The Siracha Aioli added just the right amount of kick to the dish, and the fries were home cut and salty. I'm docking a star because they did not offer malt vinegar. Which was a little shocking at an F&C joint. Yes it is a little pricey, but expect a 2x inflation rate for anything you eat or drink on the strip.",

The batter was crisped perfectly, but flavor-wise, this place was pretty disappointing. And way overpriced (as is everything in Vegas.   The set up of the place is kinda awkward. Difficult to get to the utensils and ketchup, salt, pepper stand because the pickup area and soda machine are right next to it. There's only room for one person to stand there at a time.   Lastly, I found the decorations a bit hokey.",

This is definitely not the place to go to if you want something light and healthy.  The whole menu consists of fried goods.  The type of foods to hopefully get rid of that hangover.  Got the fish and chips and the peach, ginger lemonade.  The peach, ginger lemonade was way too sweet, so that wasn't too enjoyable.  The fish was just as I had hoped, crisp on the outside and meaty on the inside--really tasty.  The fries were alright to me, I just picked at them.  I definitely had some food coma afterwards but it did its' job and refueled me for more vegas shenanigans.  Seating is limited inside but there is also a small seating area storefront.  Next time you walk by, try it out.",

You get two sauces so I choose Gordan's Tarter Sauce and the Mango Curry. Both perfect compliments for either the fish or chips.  While you pay about $15 for simple fish and chips, let's remember that this is pretty normal for Vegas prices and the quality of the fish is totally worth it.  The 0.5* off was because there is very limited seating and the location is tiny!",

The food service area is open to view and it was nice to see the food being prepared fresh and not being poured out of a frozen bag.  My boyfriend and I both ordered fish and chips combos and for Vegas I thought it was very affordable at $15 for 3 huge pieces of fish, hot crispy chips and a fountain drink with refills. You also get to choose 2 sauces with your meal and they had a self service area with ketchup and vinegar.  I opted for the sriracha aioli and southwestern ranch. The aioli was my favorite. I liked the ranch but, to me, it would've paired better with chicken instead of fish. My boyfriend got the tartar sauce and said it was good.  The fish was delicious--perfectly fried in a crunchy batter and soft and flaky in the inside.  There's not a ton of space inside for dining but there were a few tables for outdoor seating. The restaurant is fast casual so tables turned over quickly.  Definitely would reccomend!",

AMBIANCE Decked out in Union Jack colors, you feel as though you're entering a London telephone booth. Once inside, it's a straight forward queue to place your order. We came on a weekday and were the 3rd party in the queue. One criticism is that the music playing should be advertisement-free. No need to hear an Arby's commercial here.  FOOD We ordered the Fish and Chips. The host at the register did a good job at up-selling Dirty#2 which included truffle-flavored topping on the chips (fries). Can't see genuine truffle for $2. Order includes 3 conservative pieces of freshly battered large flaked white fish. The flavored chips were okay; perhaps worth the upgrade. Fish was cooked to order, but I noticed precooked fries sitting out. All sauces we tried were a good compliment.  Good experience. We will return.",

He had a bistro at Caesar's where we stayed, Hell's Kitchen, some other joint and finally this place which was at the LINQ promenade.   We had the fish and chips, shrimp and chips as well as the lobster and chips. Fish was well cooked, tender inside and crisp outside. Beer batter was one of the best I've had. Shrimp was of high quality and portion sizes were generous. The star of the show was the lobster. You get a full split tail with some shrimp for $17.99. The sauces were pretty good, I preferred the tartar and aioli. Prepacked malt vinegar was available too.  You can get the fries \"dirty\" which is with different toppings. Fries were just ok, even with the sublime bacon topping. Other options were pulled pork and finally (the best IMHO) truffle.   Not much seating and due to how busy the place was we got a bit of pressure from other patrons to hurry up and finish eating. There were some outside tables as well.  Pretty good overall and a better deal than other overpriced joints around the strip.",

One bite into the fish and you can instantly tell there is lots of love in the food. The fish is very fresh and you can definitely tell.   When we arrived the line was medium length but moved very fast! He also has a little screen for customers to play around with funny filters on their faces while they wait in line. The staff is very helpful and ready to answer all questions. As you go through the line, you can see them making fresh fish and chips and putting your meal together. There are other items on the menu that I can't wait to try! Another great Gordan Ramsay restaurant under my belt. Of course, we will be back its GORDON!",

    "text": "Walking through the LINQ entertainment district, I have always seen this restaurant.  You know, the one with the neon lights and the painted up fire hydrant out front?  Well, after walking by many times, I finally decided to dive in.  You have this small restaurant with the themes of an English/deep-fried seafood/fast food restaurant.  Smells of oil, fish, and vinegar.  TVs with soccer matches.  Windows lined with neon lights.  A Pepsi Freestyle machine.  Very limited seating.  And an overflowing garbage can right outside the front entrance, full of baskets of half-eaten cod, baking in the Vegas heat?  A lot of flies buzzing around the inside of the restaurant also.  I figured, damn, the food better be awesome for people to wait in a line that's almost out the door for a $20 basket of deep fried fish.  I waited in the line.  I bought the deep fried lobster tail and shrimp combo.  The lobster tail was delicious but was about 2 bites worth of food.  The 3 shrimp were alright.  The batter was thicker than I would have liked but hey, what can you do?  Said seafood items came served in a cardboard box over a bed of fresh cut fries.  You do get a ton of fries.  You also have the choice of 2 dipping sauces.  I went with the traditional cocktail sauce and some sort of mango dip for my other choice.  Nothing special about the sauce.  It was a hell of a battle to get a seat inside, with customers diving for tables the second they became unoccupied.  People were so desperate for seating.  People were sitting at unbussed tables covered with the garbage of the last customer's meal.  I guess that still beats sitting in the also limited, 100 degree, outside seating.  I figure, tourists come here so they can say they ate at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Maybe they were walking the strip and hankering for some fast casual, fried fish?  I would say it's not worth the novelty though.  I should have kept walking by.",

I went for the shrimp one and my husband chose the fish and chips. Every bite is so crispy and trust me you will not see the flour coating coming off the fish as and when you take the bite. Even the fries serve were so appetizing. I would recommend the mango curry with the fish and chips because this sauce is so flavorful and so different haven't seen it anywhere and goes perfectly with the fish!

    "text": "We stopped by to check out the hype and crowd. And it was indeed very crowded but the line moved fairly quickly. The issue with the small space is that the line to order the food overlapped with the line waiting for the food. In addition, there was another line for the only ONE drink machine that serves one drink at a time. One trick for seating is that if you have multiple people, definitely have someone scout for seating while one person is waiting in line.   As for the food, I enjoyed the fish quite a lot. You get 3 pieces per order. It was fresh and I loved the different sauces you can choose from (Gordon's Tartar Sauce is definitely the way to go). There were also plenty of \"chips\" (fries), so the meal combo was filling. If you are craving something different while in Vegas and enjoy fish and chips, this is the place to go!",

Some of my friends who have been to England said this is by far, the best fish n chips they've had that tastes almost identical to the real thing. The fried fish is so perfectly moist and juicy on the inside and deliciously crispy on the outside. I couldn't get enough of this. My tastebuds were happy and satisfied and I just couldn't get enough of it. The fries were great too, especially paired with the mango curry sauce, tartar sauce, sriracha aioli. Those truffle fries were amazing. Upgrade worth every penny.   The fishwich was delicious, as well. That green sauce incorporated in was what made this special. However, I think I'm good with just a simple order of fish & chips. I'm definitely coming back here every time I come to Vegas. And I will need to try the fried shrimp next time.",

    "text": "Neat little restaurant on the linq promenade.  We came on Friday evening around 5:30pm, we tried to beat the rush as it's a pretty small shop with limited seating.  There's some seats on the patio, but with the sun down, it was getting chilly, and nobody was out on the patio.  Inside there's about 14-20 seats in total?  So definitely not a place for a big party!  The menu is pretty simple, there's combos, then there's dirty fries (fries with various toppings).  I don't see on the menu where you could just order fish by itself, but if you asked, I'm sure they probably have an option.  There's always a secret menu where they give you once piece of each protein.  We elected to try the fish and chips, and the lobster and shrimp with chips.  Both comes with your choice of 2 dipping sauce.  We went to try the 2 tartar sauce, southwest ranch and sriracha aioli.  The sriracha aioli is like your spicy mayo in Japanese restaurants, the tartar sauce is night and light, with a presence of dill, and the southwest ranch was tangy and smokey.   When our order came, they gave us 3 tartar sauces, so I showed them the receipt which states sriracha aioli.  The person at the counter just gave me cut eye, then went to grab the c correct sauce, I said thank you, and she didn't really give a crap about being there.  No apology, just seemed very bothered she had to do an extra step.  Is Gordon not paying them enough to be happy to work there!??? Lol  The fish was very fluffy, the batter was out of this world.  You could taste the beer on the batter, it was light and crispy, not overly oily.  The fish was flakey and if you used a knife and fork to break it apart, it would just break up in your box.  It was such a delicate fish.   The fries were okay, fresh cut fries, nicely seasoned and not too salty. The lobster was a small lobster tail that was fried.  Not too big, and 3 big shrimps that were marinated in some pesto sauce.  It was very big and juicy!  Really yummy!! Just wish they had seafood sauce on the menu!   It didn't really go well with southwest ranch or tartar sauce.  We both upgraded for an extra $1.00 for their lemonade.  It was interesting, the orange one does taste like a creamsicle popsicle, whereas the ginger one was just lemon and tangy.  Both were actually pretty tangy.  I drank half a cup, then went to the soda machine and added sierra mist to the rest of the cup to make it tangy lemonade, and it tasted pretty good! Overall a pretty good place with good fish and chips.  Very small, so avoid the rush if you want a spot to eat.  And if you're a total rewards member, you could pay with your points :)",

Maybe it was an off night or the cooks weren't great but the fish was just way too greasy to enjoy. Was really looking forward to it being really good fish and chips.",

    "text": "Been there twice, Line is usually long. So be prepared to wait in line for quite awhile, and then another 10 minutes for food. Not enough tables to sit at either. You can walk over to In and Out and sit at the outdoor tables. Other than that, I think it is sooo worth the wait. Best fish and chips ever. Melt in your mouth, light, crispy batter. They use rice flour along with the regular flour in the mixture to get it that light and airy. Not heavy or over battered like some places. And the price isn't bad. I think it was $14.99 came with the fries and a drink. Two choices of the 6 flavors of dipping sauces but I prefer tarter or just malt vinegar and lemon. I was in the mood for fish and chips one day but didn't want to drive down to the strip to Gordon Ramsay, find parking, walk and wait, etc. I ended up finding that Red Robin has Fish and Chips on their menu and it's just a mile from my house. It was $14.59 and not even close in taste in comparison. I have tried other places but nothing compares to the perfection of this perfectly battered fish.",

I got the fish & chips dirty #2 which was truffle, Parmesan, and chives. I also got a root beer, can't go wrong with root beer. The fish was 3 large pieces, i had it with the tartar sauce, I have no complaints. The dirty #2 chips were.... okay. I was a little disappointed, it just tasted like normal fries, but I added more Parmesan and I was happy enough.  My husband got shrimp & dirty #1 chips with the vanilla orange lemonade. Lemonade was good but tangy, he loved his shrimp, and his fries were soooo good! He got it with Siracha aioli & mango something sauce?  Overall it was good, ill probably come here again when I'm craving fish & chips ^_^",

    "text": "My buddy Keith once went here 3 times in 2 days.  Said it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I knew I had to at least try it out.  We went here around 7pm on Sunday, June 10th.  Line wasn't too long, placed our order for a Fish N Chips and a Chicken N Chips.  $31.00 or so.  Not bad, especially for Vegas.   Here is what I liked and didn't like about my dining experience...................  Liked -  Fish and Chips.  Bomb!  Some of the best fish and chips I have ever had.  The fish was hot, moist, flaky and tasted fantastic.  The chips were awesome, also.  Double fried, crispy on the outside, still soft in the middle.  Really good combo! -  Price.  Around $16.00 and that comes with a fountain drink. -  Service.  Lady at the register was very friendly and nice.  Didn't Like -  The restaurant itself.  Small and cramped!  We grabbed a bar stool facing the wall, and I felt uncomfortable and rushed the whole time eating.  It was rather warm in the place, too.  Cramped, and hot combined are never good.  Meh! -  The sauces.  I tried 3 of the sauces and didn't like any of them.  I am not a mayo based sauce fan, so right away, I knew I was in trouble.  I went with ranch and curry mango for my sauces.  The ranch tasted like a hot smelly armpit that had b/o, and the curry mango was all curry, and minimal mango.  I tried a little of my friends tartar sauce and this was the best of the 3, but even then, mayo based, I can't enjoy it.  I wound up just going with plain malt vinegar for my fish and it turned out well.   -  The chicken.  It was a little overcooked, and the breading they use, doesn't work well with chicken.  It wasn't nasty or anything like that, my wife just didn't like it, and I had a few bites and it was just ok.  Skip the chicken and go with what they are known for, the fish. -  Freestyle Pepsi Machine.  Never saw one of these before, they have always been Coke.  The Pepsi machine had way less choices and was a bit more confusing to use.  There were constant lines for soda while people tried to figure out what they wanted.  Meh.  Fish and Chips= 5 stars.  Other factors =3 stars.  As long as you focus on how good the fish and chips are, you can deal with the other stuff.  They DO make a mean basket of perfectly fried fish and chips.  I would definitely come back....and eat outside or somewhere other than in the cramped ass restaurant.",

    "text": "Found a new go to spot that's very good with reasonable price in the strip. Oh man, this is a spot to hit to get a quick bite yet filling to sustain you for the rest of the night of partying or Vegas chilling whatever suits you Of course I had to try their fish and chips/fries The flavor and crunchiness of the batter is just perfect and the fish itself is surprisingly fresh. The fries were on point and for a little addition you can flavor it up with some truffle cheese. With the combo you get a fountain drink and 2 different sauces to choose from. I really like their curry and the other mayo based. Forgot the name. However with the added truffle cheese, it's just packed with so much flavor. Overall I say it's a must try for at least one meal while your in the strip. Plus I think this meal can easily be shared by 2 people. (Maybe 2 girls) haha",

However, there were 3 pieces of shrimp, one piece that was suppose to be shrimp but was only breading, 2 lobster SHELLS, and one piece of lobster.  The sauces were very good.

We had eaten a huge brunch that morning and weren't really in the mood for a big meal so this was perfect. We decided to get a box to share which was about 15 bucks and came with a drink. The box consisted to three pieces of fish and fries which were really delicious.  I wasn't expecting much going in, but this totally exceeded my expectations. The fish was flaky on the inside and crispy on the outside. I totally recommend putting lemon on it for more flavor. The fries were delicious and crispy as well. Our curry and ranch sauce complemented everything well.  There aren't many places to sit on the inside so I wouldn't come in expecting a sit down restaurant. Check it out if you're craving a quick bite on the strip!",

    "text": "If you're walking around the Link Promenade and get hungry, just look for big red doors resembling a British telephone booth and you can find yourself a quick bite at Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips.   It's a casual eatery with just a handful of tables inside and a few more out front.  The star dish here is obviously the fish and chips, but they also serve fried shrimp, chicken and sausage.  You can also just order fries that are offered in three \"dirty\" seasoning options.   I shared the Fish and Chips Combo ($14.99) which comes with 3 pieces of fish, fries, choice of 2 sauces and a drink.  For beverages, they have one of those fancy soda machines where you can add flavors to your soda and they also have fresh lemonade that I didn't have a chance to try.  For a few more dollars you can also upgrade your drink to a nice cold beer.    The fish was served hot out of the fryer.  The fresh cod fish was moist and the batter was light and crispy.  It was on the greasy side, but not to the point of being gross.  I chose tartar sauce and Sriracha aioli as dipping sauces and both went well with the fish.  Their tartar sauce has a strong dill taste and the Sriracha aioli wasn't spicy if you're wondering.  I can't complain about the fries, they were cooked well and cut a good size.  I would come back in a heartbeat for a tasty and reasonably priced meal on The Strip.  I'm not a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, but I might just have to check out his other restaurants now.",

This fish & chip style is English style which is I never had before, however as I keep eating, the more I eat the more I hate the food. Fish batter very crispy and very to break however is soak up a lot grease. Even I try dip in their special sauce I still didn't like it. Their French fried is normal, nothing especially than other place. My fried was little salty in general . I saw a lot people throw away their fried, just like me.  generally is very disappointed..

First of all the fish was a tiny sliver of fish with loads of batter , I split is open and it measured 1/4 inch of fish. It tasted of nasty old oil that had not been changed . Three little pieces of fish, strip the batter and about 3 oz of food, the chips were ok but I think anyplace can pour frozen chips/fries into a cooker... Place was confusing and employees more interested in chatting than moving customers through, ridiculous drink machine to dispense juices and kids playing on it to make one drink with 5 different choices, tables filthy no one cleaning them up, expensive crap I threw mine away and left hungry",

Here my fish was semi-warm, and the chips were nothing like the real chips you get back in UK. No sogginess for crispiness just dried out hunks of potato here. It feels like the fries are frozen and then deep fried. In a proper fish and chips place the company cut the potatoes there on the premises, blanch them then fry them. So don't be fooled America, this is not the real thing",

I'm here for a conference and I was telling everyone as I'm doing on here!  It was so delicious and melt in your mouth good.  The sauces offered were so good too!

We however decided to be daring and ordered the chipotle jalapeno fries for one combo and the bacon cheddar fries instead of regular fries. The fish was good, no complaints there. The tartar sauce was delicious, not sure if it was homemade. Pretty good start right? The fries is what made it a disappointment. Not only were my fries half hard they were also burnt. I actually had thought about asking for them to redo the fries for a fresher batch but didn't end up gaining enough courage to do so lol. I didn't wanna be that person I guess. Another disappointment is the toppings on the fries were non existent. I imagined melted cheese and bits of bacon everywhere... instead I got a dash of these condiments. The jalapeno fries was the same thing, barely anything on them. Some of you would say \"well it's about the fish not the fries.\" I disagree if you are going to have specialty fries with your menu you better do them right! Lol",

The upside is that this is probably one of the more affordable meals on the Strip at around $15.  A few friends and I tried the fried sausage, fish and chips, and jumbo shrimp. Each meal is paired with fries, which you have an option of upgrading to a more decadent version for $2. The fried sausage is more or less a corndog. The fish was in my opinion under-seasoned. And the highlight was the jumbo shrimp, which is my recommendation if you stumble into the restaurant. Also was very excited to try their curry mango sauce, but it tastes like all curry and no mango.",

Three fillets come to an order; these are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist/flaky on the inside.  So good.  You get your choice of two sauces - I tried Gordon's tartar and the sriracha mayo - some might ask why not malt vinegar but I have watched chef Ramsay cook fish and chips and he said he prefers tartar sauce.  The chips (fries) come in a variety of ways - I had truffle/Parmesan style - these were decent but could have used more truffle/Parmesan.  For those who march to a different drummer, there's also shrimp, sausage and chicken, and something called a fishwich.  A few desserts and some beer choices round out the menu.  The place is usually pretty crowded so be prepared to get in line!  The operation is pretty efficient so the line moves fairly quickly.",

Staff was accommodating, but the 1st time we had to wait extra long for the chicken. Seemed a bit strange, but no biggie the chef was applogetic and professional.  The fish was battered Light and crispy and very delicately flaked away as you bit into it. The fish itself was bland, but I didn't mind that as the dipping sauces added so much flavor to everything. Always opt for their \"Dirty\" seasoned fries. I tried dirty #1 and #3 which were both delicious.  The venue is small and packed with very limited seating. The place also had a quirky aroma to it. Maybe better ventilation is due.  We will likely return.  Edit: Grammer and typo",

But, it gave me a chance to try out both the chicken and fish, as well as a few of the different fry and sauce options, because there were plenty.  Service was quick and all of the food was delicious. I recommend the fish with chorizo jalapeno dirty fries, coupled with the sriracha mayo and southwest ranch. Top it all off with an orange vanilla lemonade.   The only downside is that the place is pretty cramped and seating is very limited. I stood outside at the raised bar for a few minutes before seats were brought out to accommodate. The Assistant Manager, Bronwyn, even stopped by our table to say hello and make sure everything was good with our meal and ask if we needed anything else, which says a lot for a restaurant as fast foodish as this one, especially when the restaurant was really crowded. But, if you're looking for a place to sit, I'd recommend taking your order to go. Keep in mind the combo prices all include a drink. So, if you don't get a drink, or opt for tap water, you can save a few bucks on the $13-16 meat + chip + drink combos.",

So the location is right in the center of the Linq promenade. You can also come out of the flamingo and exit to the promenade and it's to the left.  From the time you first see the outside it's very cute and represents Gordon's roots very well. The fire hydrant, huge sign, red doors, you can't miss it. It's very small , and would probably be extremely busy on the weekend.  We came on a Wednesday and there were already no tables , so plan to have someone scoping out a spot to sit while someone else orders.  They have a simple menu while also offering a variety . The sauce choices here are amazing. I am not a fan of tartar sauce yet the \"Gordon Ramsey tartar sauce\" was absolutely amazing.  The fish and chips is 5 stars and I've had fish and chips from Maine.   Love the presentation as well. The newspaper box lining, sauce containers, very nice. Prices are very reasonable as well. Very nice to be able to eat at a Gordon Ramsey place at a reasonable price and still get the 5 star tasting food.  Would definitely recommend and  will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Huge Gordon Ramsay fan. I don't have a palette for fine food so I don't know why I'm such a huge fan; I guess I just appreciate the artistry in the way the man prepares food. I also like to watch him go nuclear on people.  I've been to a couple of his restaurants in London but both of these were way above my dining expertise. Found this place by accident on the way to the High Roller ferris wheel and it sounded like it was right up my alley. Which, by the way, is located in an alley.  Fish & chips. You can't get more simplistic than this although there are other things on the menu such as chicken and sausages.This is a stand up and order restaurant which I don't usually like but I endured it anyway because of the man's food.  The wife and I decided to tag team our meals so she ordered the chicken and I had the fish and chips. Every meal includes two sauces so I chose the mango-curry and the sriracha Aioli and the wife chose the Southwest ranch and Gordon's Tartar sauce.  Bloody Hell! The food was awesome. I've had fish and chips everywhere in England but never none as good as these. The whitefish alone was nice and flakey with the best breading I've ever had. Got to dip the fish in all the sauces, which, were all delicious, but tasted the best with the sriracha aioli......but that's just my opinion.  Tried a piece of the wife's chicken and the breading on that was amazing too. Oddly, the chicken tasted best with the tartar sauce. Never tried that before but I did now.  I saw some other things on the menu such as the Dirty Chips (Chorizo and Jalapenos) that I will definitely try next time I'm in Vegas.  OK. Pros and cons.  Cons:  Long line, stand and order, limited seating.  Pros: Awesome food.   So quit bitchin' about the long line and seating. Get your food, find a spot on a curb or the fountain, and enjoy the best fish and chips as you people watch.",

If you throw some fresh cod, some steak fries, very bold and proud English decor, limited seats, a Pepsi machine with some beer taps (of course it would be Innis & Gunn) then you'll have GR Fish & Chips. Behind it's crispy brown outer shell was a smaller piece of fresh flakey fish ready for you to dip into your various classic sauces or more trendier sauces (I'm talking to you Sriracha whatever). Mango curry was an interesting flavor and would recommend with a side of their malt vinegar. Wash down your non alcoholic thirst with their midnight fog (Vanilla Pepsi + raspberry flavoring).   Although every corner of the restaurant is fully decorated or wrapped in some design, it is very compact in here. I would estimate around 20 available seats and terrible for groups. The service however is very quick and friendly that if you do decide to just grab it and go it looks like you'll be fine.   The restaurant may have hooked this little fish with their namesake (and probably everyone who dines here) but I won't be visiting often. The classic fish and chip combo is $14.99 with a dollar upgrade to the ginger lemonade (too sweet) ended up costing $17. Seems a little costly when you aren't even guaranteed a seat.",

Maybe that's a British thing, not sure.  Had basic fish and chips. Surprisingly affordable at $11.99 sans drink. Was expecting to pay more like $22 to $30 for the privilege of eating there so that was a nice surprise.   Food was good, fish better than most places, but fries had several chunks of rock-like texture. Side sauces were good.  Worst part of the experience was the space. There was none!   Eating IN is a dicey proposition, and who wants to take fish 'n chips OUT?  Would have given 2.5 stars if available but the fish was tasty and cooked superbly.",

The quality is there and that's all that matters. Inside of the restaurant is small, but it's meant to order, eat, and go. Their specialty drinks were amazing and fish and chips were a bit oily (in my opinion), but delicious!  The menu is simple and I like how it's in the center of Link. I'm torn because In & Out is nearby, but thank goodness my husband was with me, so we shared so I could get In & Out as well.",

Admittedly I am from England so I may be considered a bit of a snob with regards to fish and chips but pleeeease please tell me Gordon, where have you eaten crispy fried chips in England ? Please tell me ! I have never in my life had such an opposite experience of somewhere claiming to be authentic fish and chips !   Honestly ridiculous !  You may like it of course but English it is not ! And that is stupidly disappointing for someone that has high hopes from a well known English cook.   What a waste of time !  Fish was ok but not battered in traditional English style either and three small pieces instead of one decent size is also typically un English, so representative of real fish and chips this is not and again I invite mr Ramsey to point to where he has had over cooked crispy fried chips from an English chippy ?  Those things had barely seen a potato let alone come from one !  Just awful !",

I loved the light and crispy batter for the fish. They were not oily and you can taste the flavor of the fish, not what it's fried with. The fish is placed on a bed of fries to which they have different options for. They offer a variety of dipping sauces for all you saucey connoisseurs out there!

The second problem we encountered was the fact that sell their wearables from the same area you order your food and indecisive lady trying to buy shirts and aprons completely shut one of the registers down and brought ordering counter to a halt.  On the plus side once we placed the order, and cleaned the area we chose to eat at, the fish and chips were very well made and the fish you could tell was high quality and fresh!

The french fries were also excellent.  The many dipping sauces to choose from is what differentiates this place from others.  I chose the CurryMango dipping sauce and it was great with both the fries and the fish.  The only negatives are that the place is super small with only about 4 tables to sit.  So that is a problem since there is a good chance it will be either too cold or too hot to eat outside. In my case,  it was about 40 degrees and windy outside, so i had to eat standing up inside, lol...the other negative would be the high price for fish and chips, but i don't mind paying for quality....",

I was somewhat disappoint in this place as I had higher expectations after my good experience at the other.  I arrived not too long after opening and the place already had a line.  I got the Fish and Chips choosing the curry mango & tarter sauce while upgrading to one of the specialty lemonades and truffle parmesan fries.  The total came to $19 and some change.  The cod was light and flakey with a crispy batter.  It wasn't bad but it did amaze me.  If you would have told me it was from your local seafood place I would have believed you.  I could have made better fries and tarter sauce at home.  The curry mango sauce didn't taste like much.  Just mildly sweet with a hint of curry.  I had to do a double take just to make sure I was dipping into a sauce!  In the end I did give it 4 stars because it's somewhat of a \"must try\".  I can say hey I ate at GR's Fish and Chips.  At around $20 for what I got it wasn't an outrageously bad deal.  Just paying for the GR name and the Vegas strip price.",

    "text": "Best Fish & Chips in Vegas!  We were looking for something quick to eat for lunch and stumbled across this great fish and chip shop. This was my first time experiencing a Gordon Ramsay establishment and I came away impressed. There was some confusion when we first entered because it was so packed. Everyone was huddled around the delivery station at the end of the assembly line. We finally made our way through the crowd to get into the line to order. The cashiers were clearly pretty frazzled with the sheer chaos that was going on around them. Because of this they weren't very friendly but just trying to get people taken care of. Next came the long confusing wait to get the food. Everyone was just standing around the entrance to the building. There were a lot of people that were angry that they had to stand around so long waiting for their food. A lot of orders were thrown away because people were complaining about cold fries. Once one person complained then four other people would do the same. A bit ridiculous.   On to the food! We finally received our order, everything was hot and looked amazing. We found a place to sit (not an easy feat) and settled in. We had already sipped half of the lemonades we ordered. They were delicious! My favorite was the peach ginger. My brother preferred the orange vanilla. We dove into the fish right away. I ordered the tartar sauce and the \"English Style Mayonnaise.\" The tartar sauce was awesome but the mayo didn't taste unique in any way. I wish I would have tried a different sauce. The fish was so tender it was falling apart. It was piping hot and tasted perfect. I have tried many a fish and chip around the world. This totally holds its own as maybe the best I have ever had. The fries were ordinary until I added the Dirty #2 for an extra $2. The cheese and truffles with chives made the fries awesome. Try them. You won't regret it.  Overall, I will be back to Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips. I hope next time I can come at a less busy time and have a friendlier experience. The quality of the food is what will bring me back.",

This is probably the best fish and chips that I've had in the US (gotta give my top to London).  Right when you get in door, you instantly smell fried goodness.  The line was long but moved relatively fast. This is a fast food type restaurant where you order at the cashier and pick up at the counter, but totally gourmet food.  There are different combos that you can get, and you can upgrade the fries and drink.   Fish and chips: Very crispy battered fish, straight out of the fryer and piping hot. Tastes great with the tartar sauce or the curry sauce, and there's malt vinegar too if you'd like. The fish wasn't as moist as I would like, but still very fresh. Must try  Fried shrimp: not your average fried shrimp. Huge shrimp with perfect seasoning and deep fried. Very expensive and not too filling, but worth the splurge  Fry combo #1: Seasoned well and not too spicy unless you eat all the jalapenos. We upgraded our meal and it was soo good   P.s. Regular ketchup is available on the side, so don't feel obligated to get the \"artisanal ketchup\"",

I split a three piece with my friend on a Tuesday night. The chips were good, but unfortunately that's where the praise ends.  The fish tasted like nothing but butter. The breading was insanely thick and was way too salty. It was extremely greasy and bland. I might as well have just fried a stick of butter and eaten that. I ate one bite and let my friend eat the rest. Completely inedible. It's been several days and I still get mildly sick to my stomach recalling the the food here.",

The best fish n chips I have eaten were in Tauranga (a sea side city in New Zealand), Gordon Ramsay, outlet at the LinQ, is as good if not better.   A clean, well planned outlet with all things in the right place and working well.  I ordered the standard Fish n Chips - there are many options on the menu, but I will recommend the original. The quality of fish was what surprises me the most - very tender soft - most importantly fresh. It was not oily, as compared to other fish n chips around the world. This one is just right, which means they use high-quality oil for frying. The chips were like hand cut medium size chips sprinkles with light salt - nice crispy chips - along with your order you can order two sides mayo/ tartar / hot / mango curry sauces. I opted for the Tartar and Mayo (European) both very good - thick and loaded with flavor.   When at the LinQ, I would recommend you stop by to get some good quality food, at an affordable price.",

So it was a little crazy.   If you saw Gordon FB Live the grand opening he was right: this is NOT a sit down restaurant. It's a take away fish shop. Very limited seating. The line to order was out the door at 7pm but it went quickly and I ordered in no time. Beers on offer are written on a greased board at the register. They serve Pepsi products only and two lemonade flavors. I chose Orange Vanilla. It was light & refreshing but after awhile it was just too sweet for me. My order arrived quickly. It's a very simple menu so wait times are short.   Fish was good & flakey. Breading was just right. A bit bland but that is where the dipping sauces come in. You get two. Fries are fresh and good. No complaints. But with any fried food it gets heavy fast.   4 stars because people are lazy & left there trash about & no one came around to clear it or wipe tables down.",

    "text": "The wait is over everyone! Gordon Ramsey's Fish and Chips is now open!  SETTING: Located at the Linq Promenade, Gordon Ramsey has opened another restaurant in Vegas. This place is a small shack next to the Flamingo Casino entrance. The restaurant only has about 15 seats so don't expect to have a seat if you eat here. It's more of a grab and go restaurant. I love the decor of this place. The British theme fire hydrant, the telephone door entrance/exit, and the red and blue everything! The staff is super funny and friendly. Best part is they are super organized. No matter how busy and long the line is, you get your order in less than 10 minutes.  FOOD: Yes, their chips are fries;) Their fish n' chips combo is their most popular. It comes with fish, chips, and a drink. For fries, you have three options of dirty fries if you don't want them plain. You can chose between two pieces or three pieces of fish if you chose to get fish. One of favorites from this restaurant is the fried shrimp. The shrimp is really big and great in texture. They also offer the Fishwich. The Fishwich is a pida bead with arugula, tomatoes, and a fried fish. Lastly, your order comes with your choice of two sauces. All sauces are made to perfection, but my favorites are the Ramsey Tartar Sauce and the Sriracha Mayo.  DRINK: Get one of their lemonades! It's worth it! You can choose between the Orange n' Vanilla Lemonade or the Peach n' Ginger Lemonade. Both are great.  OVERALL: This place is a great grab and go restaurant. I don't recommend coming with a large group because you won't have seating. Food is simple, nothing too special. Love the atmosphere, the boxes of food, and the organized staff. Great place to have a quick meal.",

Original fish and chips: 5/5 The fish is perfectly cooked and flaky with a very light crispy batter. You get 3 pieces. The chips are thicker than your average fry and also crispy and not overly salted.  They fry the food in small batches, so it's hot and crispy when you get it. You can pick 2 sauces, and they also have self-serve ketchup and malt vinegar. I liked the mango curry sauce. We were charged $11.99 for just fish and chips (no soda), but were charged $0.46/cup for water.  The 2 negatives are the very limited inside and outdoor seating and charging for a cup for water.",

Definitely unique and one of the best sauces I have ever tasted to compliment with the fish and chips. Their fries were extremely delicious! i would definitely want more of their fries since they are seasoned heavily and crispy. Their fish was average. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor in their fish. The batter of the fish tasted like any other fish and chips batter and there actual fish inside had no flavor. Either way, nothing like their awesome sauce couldn't fix.  Sadly, I expected more from this place, but I have to say that I've had better fish and chips elsewhere. However, I would definitely come here again for their fries and sauce.",

Fortunately, by then, the crowds had died down and we only had to wait a few minutes to get in and to snag a table. The lines move quickly and the cashiers and cooks seem like they're used to dealing with large crowds.  We went with the fried shrimp and chips, and from the dipping sauces available, we chose the sriracha aioli, curried mango, and somehow ended up with the tartar sauce, too. All of them were delicious! The sriracha was more flavorful than spicy, and we finished all 3 of the sauces in no time. The shrimp were very well-seasoned and and the light batter made them hot, juicy, and perfectly crispy. It was enough food for both of us, easily. I really wanted to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding shake, but couldn't justify spending $9 on it. But they do have the most amazing, high-tech soda machine I've ever seen.... like those Coca-Cola machines that let you add your own flavors, but to the next level, with any drink combination being possible.   I'm so glad we came here and got to try the food, and I look forward to going back! Awesome location on the up-and-coming Linq promenade.",

Live large they say that is what I did go bold or go home. I tried two new dipping sauces which were amazing. the fish it's self was to die for breaded to perfection it was like cutting butter when you took a bite... I stopped being polite and stopped eating with my fork and knife and went straight in for the kill \"LOL\" using my fingers. Hands down this is the best Fish and chips I have eaten in a long time. I couldn't get over how tender and moist it was. I seriously was waiting for something to go wrong.   My Chips/Fries were done to perfection not to crispy but just right we all know me I love crispy fries. Not to sure what the seasoning was on them or how they we're made, but they we're dam good.   I also ordered some kind of dessert that was like peanut brittle, but it was chocolate with I think hazzle nut's not really sure what it was but I can tell you this I didn't share it.... for it was pure heaven.   I also had a really good lemonade while there to drink.  Now my only dilemma is I'm dreaming of the best fish and chip place and dessert and I live in Fargo, ND.... I want one here now... I will be stopping in when I am in the area again.",

They have ketchup and malt vinegar for free so don't know why someone would pick ketchup as one of their two sauces... The fish was AWESOME! Really high quality, steaming hot and stayed crunchy.

The fish, batter, and fries were not seasoned. I had to put salt on my fries. Also, the price was high. An order of fish and chips with the two drinks were over $27 with tax.

The curry is unique and has a nice kick to it. It's one of my favorites. As for the tartar sauce, it's practically flawless. Way better than what you'd get off the shelf. The fried fish is one of the best, if not THE BEST, fish I've had in my entire eating career. It's crisp and crunchy on the outside while soft and juicy on the inside. You get 3 big, chunky pieces, so enjoy every bite. Just be careful when you bite into it because it will be piping HOT.   The fries are delicious as well. They have a nice crispiness and crunchiness to it, just like the fish. They go well with the flavorful sauces. If you opt to get one of the dirty fries, know that you are able to select 2 sauces to go with. I've gotten Dirty #1 before and it's really good. However, it's just not as crisp after being tossed with other ingredients.  Also, when you order any of the combos, you can upgrade to get one of the dirty fries option for an additional $2. You also have the option of upgrading your drink to a beer for $5.   Overall, this place is a MUST.",

All the fried fish is inspected after they are finished in the fryer, and any broken pieces are taken out. All the fish have the same amount of batter, consistency in size, and flavor. They are perfectly fried everytime. Every box pretty much looks the same.   With the fish and chips combo, you also get 2 sauces! Curry mango is a nice subtle kick - the curry is the forefront of flavor with the mango adding much subtle lightness. The ranch is a bit too heavy. The tartar sauce is immaculate.  Their flavored fries are also really worth - especially the dirty fries #1!  Whenever I come to Vegas, this place is the #1 restaurant I will suggest when we think about food.  You get your food crazy fast too - they mass produce their items and have an efficient assembly line. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Well blimey Gordon, you've quite done it! *  I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey (watching his foul mouth on the various shows he's on as well as his cooking videos). My bf and I were in Vegas and tried out the fish & chips here and it was absolutely delicious!  We both opted for the fish & chip combo, which comes with a drink and 2 sauces of your choice. We decided to go with curry & mango, sriracha aioli, Gordon's Tartar sauce, Dijon mayo, and Southwest Ranch (they only had 4 types of dips available lol so we were able to try everything). Our favorite dips were the sriracha aioli, southwest ranch, and tartar sauce. I highly recommend them!  The fish & chips were so delicious. The fish was perfectly breaded and we opted for the 2 \"dirty\" chips option: truffle/parmesan/cheese and bacon/cheddar. I really liked the truffle parmesan fries and they do give you a big handful of them! The bacon/cheddar was just as good but I felt it to be a bit too heavy for my taste because you got savory dips all around with the chips as well.  Overall, quality of the food is great! Be sure to come before the rush because tables are so hard to come by because the restaurant itself is super small.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay and fish & chips! Two things that I was quite excited for in this quick-service restaurant. The space is nicely themed, with British influences inside and the storefront. Their menu has fish and chips, and some other options in case you're interested in something else.  The last time I was here, my friend and I shared two combos, which include fries and a drink. +FISH & CHIPS: The fish is so soft and flakey, with a perfectly crisp outside.  *SHRIMP & CHIPS: The shrimp was not overcooked so it was a nice contrast to the fried batter. There's also herbs in this which is a nice addition. (I personally preferred the fish & chips but my friend said she liked this one better.)  The chips were crispy and goes well with the sauces you can choose. Each combo comes with two, and my preferences are the tartar sauce and the southwest ranch. The curry one seems popular but wasn't for me. Honestly, the combo is quite a lot of fried food and can feel heavy, but it definitely is delicious. For the drinks that come with the combo, they give you a cup and you can refill it with one of their soda machines (where you can choose varying flavors of sodas or teas).   The space itself is a little weirdly designed. To order, you have to go all the way into the back of the restaurant, which seems to be designed more for takeaway. There is very little seating (which is at the front), and it gets crowded really quickly. People also tend to scout for seats so it can be awkward, especially since the spacing between the seating isn't great. While it's meant for takeout, there isn't much space to sit and eat outside the restaurant where it's located.  All in all, as a fish & chips fan, the food is crispy and tasty but the layout is not ideal.",

What's more, they're put on top of the fries allowing all the greasy to soak the fries underneath, leading to the dreaded soggy fries!  Overall, not worth the money.  For a little bit more, you can grab a half decent buffet nearby.  For 1/3 the price, you can get an equally filling but infinitely tastier In N Out meal just steps away.  Hard pass on this one.",

Sitting atop truffle fries makes it a perfect meal.  I only used the tartar sauce  but the selection is designed for a broad spectrum of tastes... Dijon mayo, southwestern ranch to name some.   See my photo.  Peach ginger lemonade:  It was OK.  Not as good as I thought.   Price: $15  Not bad.   Parking:  I have to mention this because it's the Strip.  We parked at Linq and it was free because it was under an hour I believe.   It was midday so it wasn't difficult  but night time may be different.  So your experience may differ.   Seating: Not that big inside so it may get cramped or you may not get a seat at all depending on the crowd.  Go fish.....",

I got the original fish and chips but the got garlic parmesan chips. The fish was cooked perfectly and with the malt vinegar and gordon's tartar sauce, delicious!   The chips were pretty good also, it was overwhelming with the garlic , but smelled amazing and taste just as good.  I paid $18 overall for my meal, but honestly worth it to me and  I highly recommend this for anybody looking for their fish and chips fix here in Vegas . Ramsey did it again!",

This place drew my wife in by the fact that Fish & Chips is one of her favorite snack/finger food.  The place was PACKED.  Usually a good sign.  The line moved very quickly, and prices seemed pretty reasonable, as this is considered \"strip food.\" The wait for the food wasnt terrible considering every seat was taken in the place, like i said-- packed!  I like Gordon Ramsey recipes, they are different, in a good way.  I love the way he fries his food as well.  The Fish & Chips were great, (my wife had them) and they seemed crispy but delicate and nice.  I had the chicken fingers and they were great.  The fries for each of us were amazing.  This was a lot of food, and i felt gross after because i ate too much, but for anyone saying this is too greasy, #1, i didnt think it was TOO greasy, and #2 this is finger food, not sure why you would think you are getting a salad?

The fish is fried in golden color, crispy, with lots of flavors and the actual fish inside is thick, still not crushed at all and really good fish quality. The fries are also really good too, thick cut with great seasoning. You can choose dipping sauce like curry mango, tartar sauce, etc. The sauce is creamy yet not overly done, unique and just brings the whole fish and chips to another level. Also, the portions are HUGE. It's worth every penny.  Gordon earns my respect and he has the qualities and abilities to yell whatever he wants to, to his contestants because the man makes quality food at his restaurants. From this basic fish and chips, I can definitely see how he is with his other signatures. He should open more of this fish and chips restaurants in the states.",

    "text": "Fish & Chips? More like grease and a stomach ache!  As a Brit now living in Las Vegas, nostalgia of my beloved food staples (and yes, fish and chips is a staple in my eyes!) sets in and I love to try different takes on the British classic around the city.   Of course, we have all heard of Gordon Ramsay and with such a reputable name attached to this fish and chips, I was excited and reassured to try this best of British dish under an immensely popular British name.  The restaurant/cafe itself is a good size to accommodate and is clean and colourful. The decor itself from the doors to the seating and the fire hydrant outside is a cheesy cliche, but it's fun and I understand that it appeals to the typical tourist.  For food, I went for the classic fish and chips, I also tried the battered sausage (a much loved side for us Brits) with some curry and mango sauce and tartare sauce on the side.  When it finally arrived despite the quieter hour, the fish and chips was a let down. It was so greasy that my hands were wet with grease throughout. As much as fish is deep-fried, it should not be to that extent. The chips were regular run-of-the-mill chips, not the British-style chips that I'd hoped would come with the meal.  The fish was also so soft, it totally fell apart and I was left a few times just holding a battered casing.  The battered sausage was an insult. Why come to a British cuisine establishment to serve Italian sausage in batter?! It was spiced and gritty, not at all a British-style sausage.  The sauces were a little better. The curry sauce, although different from the British style, was very good and the added mango flavour lifted a heavier curry taste quite nicely. The tartare was very buttery, but also good.  Are you getting BRITISH fish and chips or anything remotely similar at this dramatically-decorated British themed restaurant? No, you're not. Not even close. With the American grease, the Italian sausage and the typical French frie, it's hard to understand what is actually British about the food served here.  We unfortunately left our food, unfinished and held our heavy, grease-filled stomachs for the following few hours.   Not again I'm afraid!",

The fish tasted like frozen, grocery store fish out of a box. I was VERY surprised. Chips and slaw were good but my goodness the fish awful. You'd bite into a corner of it and it would just be batter with no fish. It's The Strip so the portions are tiny for the price.",

    "text": "After walking quite a way, from the Paris hotel to get here, I'd have to say that it was worth the trek. I had the fish and chips w/truffle fries --of course. It was SOOOO GOODD and piping fresh!! The fish literally falls apart when you pick it up--so flaky! The house made tarter sauce was also really yummy. The only complaint I do have is, there's not a lot of seating to accommodate the line of patrons that literally goes out the door. So don't be surprised if u walk in and there's no where to sit. It is a order at the register and wait in them to call your number, to pick up your food-type of place. The line does move kind of fast, but if you're starving, probably not fast enough. We lucked up on some seats along the wall, as we were waiting for our numbers. If it's a packed house, I'd say to be mindful of the other patron coming in--eat your food and go!",

I love a good fish n chips and couldn't resist grabbing some for the group to share as we decided on plan B for lunch.   The ordering process was quick. They offer upgrades on their fries- truffle, Parmesan, chives, etc... The fish is made and cooked to order in  a fully-visible kitchen area. My order was ready in less than 10 minutes and came out piping hot and fresh.   The fish was so flaky covered with a well-seasoned batter. The homemade tartar sauce was the perfect complement for the fish and fries.   Good fish n chips is generally hard to come by. Even in the south bay just a couple of spots come to mind so I never pass up an opportunity for good fish.",

The service is fast and easy. The fish and chips is good, but nothing like in England, but we are in America so you can not get the same taste all around the world!

You can park at the Venetian self-parking and walk to the Linq, as the parking is still free (+ you can walk around the shops there too).   I got the fish and chips combo with Gordon's tartar sauce and southwest ranch, and was fully satisfied! The fresh Alaskan Cod was so tender, fresh, and I could definitely taste the two distinct profiles between the fish and batter. The two sauces complimented the whole meal perfectly, along with the lemon slice they give you.  The only thing would be having the option to purchase the fish and chips without the combo drink, but overall, I would definitely come back to get more!",

Talk about perfection. I love when a restaurant only serves a specialty because then you know it's good. Can't mess up when there's only a few options to pick from.   Try and come during off times. 10:30, after lunch and before dinner. The lines can be extremely Long.  Sometimes worth waiting and sometimes it's not.   Pros - affordable ($14) -great sizes. Both of us couldn't finish all the fish and French fries  -Love that there's so many different dipping options.  - fast and fresh. We got our food in five minutes after ordering. Quick and efficient.   Cons -not enough seating.  -no wheel chair ramp.  The pros far outweighs the cons. Especially for the busy expensive strip. This place is a gem .",

We had other fish & chips as we drove from LA to Vegas and my friends agree this was the best during our trip.   The fours stars is really due to the price of $14.99 and the long wait it took (15-20 mins) to get the food after ordering.     My friend love the mango & curry sauce and said his special tartar sauce was tasty as well.  The fish was fried on the spot and was hot & fresh with a good thickness.  We ordered 1 combo in the afternoon to sample as we had another 7 pm appointment at Gordon's steak house that evening.  One of my friend was impressed they had Wechat paid there too and used his Wechat to purchase the combo.",

Once we finally did place our order there was no place to sit and eat. The food? It was okay. Not great but not bad either. And definitely not worth standing in that line to order. Even the one drink station they had made you stand in line. The fish was tasty and I appreciated the fact there wasn't a lot of batter. The fish was good quality and we up charged to get the truffle French fries. They were really good too. But again - not worth the wait. Save your time and make a reservation at Hell's Kitchen where the food is so much better and you won't have to wait in line! We did!",

The fish comes fresh from the fryer so you can always ensure that piping hot! I highly suggest squeezing the fresh lemon that they give you on top of the fish, it gives it an added flavor and cuts some of the grease. The fries were a little dry this time and not soft and fluffy like they should be . The dipping sauces are fabulous!! I highly suggest the curry sauce, the southwestern ranch, and the tarter sauce. I couldn't stop dipping my lame fries in the southwestern ranch because it was just that good! And come on, fish and chips without tartar sauce is a sin. Seriously people!   I have never been disappointed with the service here but I have never been impressed either. The staff is perfectly fine and they are there just doing their job. Make sure to set aside some time to come to this restaurant because the wait can be pretty long. Also, not super kid friendly. The seating is very limited and no high chairs.   I gave this restaurant three stars because it has been good at times and not so good at times. I also usually leave with a little bit of a stomach ache because the quantity of fried food I just consumed but it is worth it. This restaurant wouldn't be on my top 10 (or 20) places eat in Las Vegas just because I am not a fish and chips fanatic but if you are this is your place!  Oh if you are looking to save a few bucks, you can always get your meal without the drink and you can buy menu items a la carte.",

The tartar sauce and sriracha aioli were amazing. I love the truffle fries too. Everything was perfect. Although we waited ~10 minutes to get our food, it was totally worth it since it was freshly fried. The whole meal was yummy. Will definitely come back in the future!!",

The lighting makes for a gentle, but well illuminated eating space, and the space is embellished with finely crafted furniture. We thought this place was very quiant, but lacked the True spirit of Gordon Ramsay. The sauces were pretty good, especially the sriracha aioli, but our conversation and our company were better. With that, I'd like to personally thank the staff at this fine dining establishment for making our first experience together memorable, and the palatable experience mild.   We also found the quality of the fish impressive; flaky, perfectly cooked. We expected nothing less for an establishment marked with the Ramsay name. Although our experience and the food here was more than decent we don't see ourselves going out of our way to eat here again. We don't frequent the Linq much as it can be a very difficult place to find space to park but on those drunken nights we find our way here from the strip we would be more thank happy to feast on the delectable fish and chips served here.",

The sausage was quite good. I tried the fries cooked in truffle oil, which was a bit overpowering. This was average price (for Vegas) - a bit under $35 for 2",

We ordered the three piece fish and chips with a side of artisanal ketchup, curry mango, and sriracha aioli.   The fish...spectacular! Amazing batter, thin and crispy, golden brown perfectly fried! The fish was flaky, light, and not fishy at all! The chips..oh man those chips! The crispiest, crunchiest fries I have had! Lightly salted, and amazing with the ketchup   The sauces were fantastic too! not too spicy with the sriracha, and the curry mango was not too sweet, both thick, flavorful, and perfectly paired with the fish!

The exterior of the location has the red telephone booths as the in and the out doors. There is a cutely painted fire hydrant, as well. The inside does not have much space for customers. There is just a few tables and countertops with stools. You can see the employees making food, and the whole place is fairly new, so it feels super clean in there.  Anyway, this location was a MUST visit for me. I absolutely love good fish and chips, and I got more than that here. I got excellent fish and chips! They were so, incredibly light and crispy. We ordered just the fish and chips, and it comes with two sauce sides. We ordered the ranch and the tartar. Without a drink, it came to $12.79, which is a reasonable price. It came with three good-sized pieces of fish and a lot of fries and lemon slices. One order was enough for my husband and me.",

I would like to have more options than chips, maybe something green.  But the overall value of the meal with drink included makes it OK.  The dipping sauces are unique, and we liked the Ranch and the Curry Mango better than the Sriracha Aioli and the Tartar Sauce.  The fish itself is perfectly cooked, tender on the inside with the lightest batter I have ever eaten.  I usually pull this stuff off, but it was crisp and brown and complimented the texture of the fish.  The chips are so-so. Do not expect a large and comfortable place:  it is tiny and crowded, but definitely convenient and fast.  We sat outside and enjoyed watching the  people passing by.  All around fun experience!",

Not good. Over priced and just kinda ordinary and nothing to ever try again. The batter of the fish was pretty much flavorless and seemed light. The chips (fries) were just ok. Pretty much like burning $40 in the street. And was hungry like an hour later. That always sucks.   Now The Auld Dubliner at Lake Las Vegas has fish and chips make by the gods. If you like crunchy and delicious batter on big chunks of cod fish this is the place. The only downside it's far far away at Lake Las Vegas.",

The chips or fries were seasoned nice too. I loved the sauces. I'm a sauce dipper person though. I got the curry mango sauce & tarter. I loved the curry mango! It was surprisingly sweet & smooth. The prices were kind of high ($~18) for the fish & chips combo with the lemonade & a cup of water. Also, I knocked off a star for the tight space to sit & not much seating. There is seating outside though. It was across from our hotel the Mirage so it was convenient to walk to.",

My three hungry boys and I are vacationing on the strip and decided ( after a delicious visit to Gordon Ramsey's burger place the week before - were we had the most delicious truffle fries on earth ) ; to try out his fish and chips place . My crew was in the mood for fish but I wanted the sausage . I am not a fan of battered food so I asked the cashier to ask the chef to make my protein without the batter. She came back and said that the chef was happy to make mine with just a light coating of flour. Being an English \"fish and chip\" shop , I was expecting that I would be getting some kind of English banger / sausage thingy and I was excited . I went to school in the UK , and know what to expect from a chippie. After all it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant right ??? Well , I am going to show you the pictures of what I got and let you come to your own conclusions. I am expecting to see this restaurant on the next episode of kitchen nightmare's \"burnt sausage edition\". I want a do-over , or my money back. The truffle and Parmesan fries we paid extra for were disappointing as well . Not sure if we just went in on a bad day but for fifteen bucks for a box of food, I was hoping for better .",

If you can find the High Roller, a towering observation wheel, you can find the Linq.  Toward the entrance of the Linq is Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips restaurant.  It's a tiny place with a handful of tables, and counter stools.  Considering the place is in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, the prices aren't bad.   For $14.99, I got the signature Fish and Chips basket, which came with 2 dipping sauces a drink. For $5 more, you can upgrade your soda for an imported beer.  Stephen chose to upgrade to the Innis & Gunn beer, which he gave a thumbs up.  The fish wasn't greasy, and we received 3 generous pieces that was mostly fish, not batter.  The fries were just ok.  I would have preferred them to be a little more crisp, and I think I got the leftover little pieces.  Overall, a good meal that wasn't too expensive.",

I ordered the truffle, Parmesan, and chives fries, which comes with your choice of 2 dipping sauces. I went with the sriracha aioli and curry mango. The sauces are exotic for sure and may not be for everyone, but they grew on me. The fries were crispy but they didn't have much else going for them. They lacked flavor and the toppings were not evenly distributed (e.g., there was a huge chunk of chives in one corner of the box and most of the fries were left more or less bare). I felt like they definitely could've executed better, considering it was almost $8 for a small serving of fries, and this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, but hey.   I did enjoy the British vibe all around; it almost reminded me of being back in Europe. I don't think I would go back just for the fries again but they were definitely better than the fries I had at in n out the night before.  It's located between the Linq and the Flamingo, next to a frozen daiquiri bar. There are lots of other restaurants nearby as well.",

We passed out immediately after our meal; when we woke up, we all ate our leftovers. That's how GOOD it was. We all couldn't stop raving about it.   Most of my friends thought that the fish tasted better than the chicken; either way, you can't get go wrong with either of them.

I don't care for seafood much but I love good fish and chips and surprisingly it's hard to find somewhere that makes it perfectly.    We arrived shortly after opening and proceeded to order.  I opted for the fish and chips with tartar and ranch.  The food was done rather quickly and we went and grabbed our food.  I couldn't wait to dig into my food.  The fish and chips were pipping hot but that didn't stop me.  I dug in and the first thing I noticed was the crispness of the fish.  It was unlike any other fish and chips I've had.  The fish was cooked perfectly, it was moist and flavorful.  The tartar paired perfectly with the fish.  The chips were very good however I have had them better at one other place.  They still ranked 2nd for me.  My sister tried the curry mango sauce with her fish and chips and it was something completely different and unexpected.  I'm not a fan of mango but that was one sauce I'd definitely order next time.   Now, the only problem I have is that it is a 5 hour drive to get another order when I want more.  I need a location to open closer to me!",

    "text": "As an ex-pat living in Colorado I am constantly on the lookout for some decent fish and chips. They are extremely rare in the US. Sadly, Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips is no different from any other poseur fish and chip restaurant, with the exception of being rather expensive and over-priced. The chips were average, but needed that something extra that True British fish and chips provides. I think it is that GR's restaurant, like most other places in the US use inferior potatoes, potatoes that do not fry well. To date the only place that has come close to real British chips is The Codmother in San Francisco and they use Kennebec potatoes, maybe you should use those too, Gordon? Unlike most people who have frequented GR's fish and chip shop I did not have the fish but instead plumped for the sausage, hoping for a British style sausage. Again, sadly disappointed. First, the sausage was battered, which personally I cannot abide and think it totally unnecessary, secondly, the sausage supplied was not, to me anyway, a British style sausage, but some hybrid with the texture of a British sausage, but the flavour of some poncy high-fallutin' lump of sausage meat, which had been messed about with and no doubt someone, somewhere, thought that their recipe had improved the sausage but in fact had made it sweetly flavoured, which as anyone in the know of British sausages knows, is not right. And also, just to add insult to injury, the two sausages were about two inches long and served impaled on wooden sticks. Although this is twee, it is not how a proper sausage should be served. To sum up then, not British fish and chips, not British sausages, hugely overpriced, not worth it, generally. Would not bother going there again. Thank you.",

What is not understandable is why it takes so long to receive your order. You would think with a limited menu the time to cook and box the fish and chips would be quicker then it was. Perhaps the place just opened and the staff had not yet figured out the process.  Hopefully, Gordon will step in and correct the situation.

Probably the best tartar sauce because you can feel the freshness and shrimp are jumbo shrimp not easy to put everything in one go. The batter for shrimp was very different maybe they mixed some spices in that it tasted really good. A quick grab and go place combos are ranging from 12.99-15.99+ taxes. They serve only beer.",

Oh a plus was they had quite a few beer selections, including a personal favorite, Firestone.",

    "text": "I was beyond excited to try this place because I have had nothing but great experiences at his other local restaurants. So I took my family who was visiting from out of town to try it out. I raved about his other places even though they were skeptical, we still gave it a go because it was so cute and I couldn't pass it up.   The menu is a little confusing and when I stepped up to order, the counter worker did not walk us through the menu.  Located in a tourist spot I'm sure a lot of the people walking in are first timers so it would have been helpful for a quick run through of what the combos are.  We ordered fish and chips not knowing any of the other items .  The counter worker seemed frustrated with our order, but we didn't realize that they were about to close, so that makes sense. When we got our food, I am sad to say it was mediocre at best. The fish was bland and the fries were dried out. No salt, no seasoning, just literally fish and fries. We probably should have opted for one of the more \"fancy\" fry options, but with no recommendations we didn't really know. The look on our faces said it all. Blah. For $16 and Gordon's name on the door, I would expect something worth while, or at least something I could eat rather then throwing our dinner in the trash.  The place is beyond cute! The open kitchen gives you the fresh food feeling. The service was ok. People came in while we were eating and the restaurant was closing and the line cooks just said \" oh we're closed.\"  I think most people now a days have worked in some line of service and could agree that a warm welcoming or inviting guests to come back when they're open  literally can make a difference.  To sum it up: The restaurant has an awesome fresh feel. The service needs some work. The food was blah. I don't think this is what Gordon Had in mind. Needless to say we won't be back, and I will recommend his other restaurants instead.",

For an extra $2, we can make the regular fries into a dirty fry. The whole package came with 3 pieces of fried battered fish and a buttload of fries. The total came out to be around $17.   We opted for the Dirty Fries #2 which was fries with truffle, parmesan, and chives. And got to choose 2 sauces for our fish and chips. We got the dijon Mayo, and the gordan ramsey tartar sauce.   My bf and I shared this and were so full after eating 1 of the fish. Everything was so filling and felt very heavy. We barely even finished our fries. We were not blown away by the meal but the meal didn't suck either. Everything just seemed mediocre. The tartar sauce was lacking something so it didn't tie the whole dish together. Wished it was better.",

I went with the classic, the fish and chips.   The interior is fairly small with only a few tables and some bar seating. There are also a few tables outside, but the seating is seriously lacking considering how much traffic this place gets. Definitely not made for bigger groups.  The wait for the food wasn't bad; they were fairly busy and we only waited 10/15 minutes for the food. The fish: delicious! The breading is light, crispy, and fried to perfection. The French fries were also good and you got a good portion size with your basket. The fountain drink machine is nice because there is such a large selection and you can mix drinks.   Another good point is the selection of sauces. My favorite was the Southwest Ranch! However, I'm a traditionalist when it comes to the fish and chips and loved the fish with Gordon's Tartar Sauce.  Overall, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips really lives up to the hype. I will be back for sure on my next visit :)",

We were pleasantly surprised how flaky and crispy the fish was. Their mango curry sauce was so good with the fish. We also had the tartar sauce.. it was good.. just not as good as the mango curry sauce. We would definitely try again when we stay at The Linq hotel. I deducted 1 star due to small seating area. We were able to find a seat after squeezing through a huge party that took up half the seating in there. Other than that, love the food and fast service!",

Whats impressive is even though this is a fast casual restaurant, the presentation and customer service is definitely instilled. For as many orders as is coming out of here, that's impressive!  The fish was probably the best I've had, I got the fish n chips and added a 5 pieces side of shrimp. I was offered 2 sauces with each so I ordered southwest ranch, sriracha aioli, curry and mango, and the tartar sauce. We were a party of 5, so each had a shrimp, the shrimp was perfect! I wish their was a combo choice because it was too much food with 3 pieces of fish, fries and even 1 shrimp. The shrimp and the sriracha aioli was an amazing combo! While all the sauces were delish, I prefer the fish with good ol fashion malt vinegar (available on a counter with ketchup and salt and pepper) the drink machine had a nice variety of options including Tropicana orange soda which goes great with fish n chips ;) The reason for the star loss was the fries. Upon seeing them I had high Hope's, but, they were a bit too cooked for me. I found them definately more like chips than what us Americans are used to, so maybe that's how they are in Brittain, but I prefer mine a little more fluffy on the inside.  Still an awesome place with great staff and amazing food!",

Actually, best fried fish I've had, but the fries can be a bit bland and isn't really worth an additional $2 to make them special, such as parmesan and truffle, etc.   Simple concept, and definitely the cheaper Gordon Ramsay establishments in Vegas. You go in, get in line, order, and pick up your food after they call your number. Their fish n chips combo comes with a few pieces of awesome battered, lightly fried fish, and the fries, and it comes with a drink. That'll cost around $15 before tax. For extras such as alcoholic drinks or upgrade your fries (add flavor), it'll cost extra. The fish n chips come with 2 sauces- can choose between tartar, curry, ranch, sriracha aioli, etc.   The fish has such a perfect crunch to it, though if it's not eaten right away, the batter falls off easily and the part not facing up can get a bit soggy. The fries/chips are a bit plain, but they are still good. I suppose its to be customized in regards to seasoning, such as their sauces or ketchup.   Their soda machine is one of those Pepsi remix kinda. Vanilla flavored cola = yum!",

There isn't much seating, but this is typical to most traditional chippies in the UK. The menu has been kept simple and there isn't a choice of fish, there are no \"sides\" to pick from either, no mushy peas?!!! They have them at the GR pub, so surely  it wouldn't be anything but good business to have them here as an upsell with the fish n chips?!  The food came out quick and was good, the fries were a little dry  and the fish was in 4 small pieces, rather than traditionally one long piece, but that's just me nit picking.  The dipping sauces were a nice touch, but I'd still rather a hot curry sauce than a curry mayo to dip my chips in. Overall it was good, if a little pricey!",

The fish was buttery smooth and the batter was the perfect crisp to a delicious, flaky shell. I've had lots of fish n chips all over California and nothing comes close to the taste, freshness, and texture of this restaurant. The truffle fries were also so good.   The price is definitely on the higher end ($17-20 for a combo), but for the quality and taste, it's worth it. Trust me",

The line was long (20 minutes) but could have gone faster if everyone was busting their ass like the head chef. She always kept busy and would not rest. Once I placed my order the food was ready fairly fast. I really enjoy my sauces so I tried every single one. The mango curry was not what I was expecting and didn't like it. The other sauces taste like what they sound like. The tartar sauce was really good. The fish and chips were exactly what you would expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Then the sticky toffee pops were unbelievably good.",

Everyone that knows me knows I love British everything. So I knew I definetly needed to try the Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips.   The place is quite small so don't recommend for large groups, its very cool and clean and the customer service was on point. I love the decorations and lively red and blue colors  I ended up ordering the shrimp and lobster combo for 18.99, the shrimp is crispy and not greasy and the lobster was very buttery, the only reason why I didn't give them a five star was because of how small the portion was, the box came with three jumbo shrimp and small lobster.   I regret not upgrading to the dirty chips and they have a good variety of drinks.",

You can actually order the fish and chips without lemonade but it would be helpful to actually show that on the menu. The biggest gripe is there is almost no seating.

I came here twice to have Gordon's Fish & Chips and experienced some difference in the quality of the fish I was served.  Both times I ordered the GR fish combo with peach and ginger lemonade with the sriracha aioli and Gordon's tartar sauce. My beer-battered fish were similar in shape (looks to be cut into a 3/4\" - 1\" cube strips) had a beautiful golden color and the fish was extremely moist. It was truly one of the best beer-battered fish I have ever eaten. The sriracha aioli also paired extremely well with the fish and the ginger lemonade was truly refreshing.  For my second visit I ordered the exact same thing and changed the dipping sauce to southwest ranch and sriracha aioli. To my dismay, Two out of the three pieces of my fish were over-fried and came out a dark brown charred-looking color. One of them was passable but the shape of each fish was also irregular. I almost wanted to send my food back but didn't have enough time to wait for another batch so I was rather disappointed.  I would have given the place a 5-stars had the quality been a bit more consistent.",

They could keep me company while I feast on some fish!  I ordered the standard Fish & Chip meal ($14.99) and a Biscoff shake ($8.99). I chose the Curry& Mango and Gordon's Tartar sauce. The fish was good it didn't taste like Van Decamps (Frozen boxed fish) . My friend asked me would I eat here again because it sounded pricey for Fish & Chips and my answer was, \"Yes\" .  Even though you can get this at other places for a fraction of the cost I like the sauces which were really tasty. It's like (Gordon Ramsay would probably hate that I mentioned his restaurant and Mc Donald's in the same breath ) If I want chicken nuggets I'll only go to Mc Donalds because I like their sauce selection...Popeye's Mardi Gra mustard is also good. I think when you make a sauce it takes the dish to the  next level especially if you can't get it everywhere . The Biscoff shake was really unique and delicious as well.It's about taking something basic and putting your own spin on it. Everything was cooked well and next time I'm in the neighborhood I'm going back for seconds!",

Got there just in time, because the line literally formed out the door.  You can eat indoors our outdoors.  It was not easy getting a table in either spot.  Got the combo meal w/two pieces of fish, fries, two sauces and a drink for $15. You can pick two different sauces, but I in general love tartar sauce so I got two.   When I first bit into the fish, my eyes popped out of my head - it was so delicious.  The coating on the fish is light and airy and yummy.  The food comes out piping hot. I loved the tarter sauce (so, so delicious) and the french fries were very good too.  I thought for the amount of food you got, that it was very reasonable for Vegas.  I would rather go here than Gordan Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen, which I also went to.",

The inside was air as well, so really you're getting nothing but batter and mushy fish. Some sticks were overly salty and the fries weren't any better. Dry and salty. My parents and I could NOT handle eating it all. I tried to eat it all to get my money's worth, but I couldn't hold the food down. Was DEFINITELY NOT worth $14.99 and for 3 people it was around $48. Going Las Vegas, this is not a place I'd reccomend in my opinion. Maybe I just prefer the fish here in Maui, Hawai'i.",

We have also been trying out recipes shared by Gordon Ramsay, so it was a must try restaurant along the strip!  The restaurant was packed, but there wasn't a long line to order food and it was easy to grab seats, since people generally won't take long to finish their meals.  For the two of us, we only ordered a fish and chips combo to share. This turns out perfect for us since we are watching our weight. Haha! The fish and chips combo comes with 3 pieces of fresh & well battered crispy fish and some crispy chips. We chose Gordon Ramsay's tartar sauce and Curry & mango sauce to go along with our fish and for chips, we had dirty #1 which comes with chipotle, jalapenos and crisp chorizo. The fish has won my heart, as it is fresh (doesn't come with fishy taste and fishy smell)! We enjoyed this meal and will definitely come back for the fish and chips again!  Looking for affordable food by Gordon Ramsay along the strip? This is probably the cheapest among the 4 restaurants of Gordon Ramsay!",

I ordered the original fish and chips, but everything on the menu is reasonably priced for Vegas, light and flaky, perfectly fried and not too greasy-definitely a spot to stop by during your next visit to Vegas.  The do serve alcohol here-beer and some mixed drinks on their menu!",

We had the fish and chips and the sausage and chips. Everything was overwhelmingly greasy and over cooked. The fries were very hard also.

On top of that it was really oily, and the batter was pretty terrible too. In fact I would say that it is probably one of the worst fish and chips that I've had to date. Expected more given that the fish and chips in the UK are really good... and this is apparently meant to be a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   Shakes are decent... preferred the shakes at Ramsay's burger place, but these were pretty tasty.   It seems to be more of a takeout place, with a few tables. Its a little cramped... the waiting area, drink area, and area with ketchup/silverware all share the small space, which is a little awkward.",

The chips (fries) could've been a bit more chip-like - thicker and more potato-y. Definitely season up your fries for $2 if you enjoy chili cheese fries. I wasn't too big of a fan of the chipotle seasoning. It tasted too meaty.   Ooooo, the sauces tho! They have a wide selection from which you can choose from. Try the sriracha aoli, tastes like sriracha mayo with a kick of citrus.   For the most part, this joint is decently priced and tasty for a Gordon Ramsay place in Vegas. The employees are also super sweet which makes the experience so much more enjoyable. It's a nice, treat-yourself meal since everything is fried.",

I gravitated for the original fish and chips but they do offer shrimp and chips and chicken and chips for those allergic to shellfish.  I opted for the southwest and tartar sauce which were recommended by the worker. I also paid more for an upgrade to the Parmesan fries  which were delicious! Nicely seasoned and too much to finish in one sitting. The fish tasted fresh and had a nice crunchy thin layer to it. In my opinion these fish and chips beats most of the fish and chips I've had in England!   This place is small and doesn't have an in house bathroom but it is fairly close to the Flamingo and Linq casino. Love the location of this place as it's on the Linq promenade and has lots of shops and bars around it!",

The batter on our fish and shrimp was crispy perfection and the fish and shrimp were fresh and cooked perfectly.  The chips were just okay for me we upgraded to truffle and pork belly chips, but I think  regular fries would have been fine.  I think the 3 piece fish was $14.95 and the 5 piece shrimp was slightly higher at $15.95.     On top of the fantastic fish and shrimp the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake was to die for!  I guess since Gordon Ramsay opened up this fish and chip shop and re-branded Gordon Ramsay Burgr to Gordan Ramsay Burgers you can no longer get pudding shakes at the burger joint.  Needless to say it is worth a trip just to try this super delish shake for $6.95.  I highly recommend this spot, it did not receive five stars because it is way to small and there is not enough seating.",

Ordered the regular Fish & Chips for $14.99 and the special Wellington Surf & Turf $18.99. What a waste of $ !! There were 2 pieces of deep fried beef Wellington on a stick - looked like a corn dog. Barely edible. My husband didn't want it either. No flavor just deep fried batter wrapped around small bite size pieces of beef. We dumped it, it was gross! The 3 pieces fish in the fish and chips were very small pieces about 2-3\" in length. They give a lot of fries - such a rip off. Gordon Ramsey should be ashamed of himself for attaching his name to such poor food quality. Save your $ and walk a few doors down to In-N-Out.

I managed to convince my boyfriend to leave our air-conditioned abode and walk 10 minutes to this fish & chips spot, which is nicely nestled in an alleyway of food and libations. The food is served quickly, though the place would have benefited from more than one cashier. There's a handful of indoor and outdoor seats, but you might need to wait on open seats.  We each got a fish & chips combo, which, non-advertised, is $11.99 without the fountain drink, $14.99 with the fountain drink. Upgrade your fountain drink to one of the lemonades for $1 more, and upgrade the fries from natural to dirty for $2 more. Each combo comes with 3 pieces of lightly battered, unsalted cod atop a handful of thick-cut fries and your choice of 2 sauces. My boyfriend and I got the curry mango sauce, sriracha aioli, and Gordon's tartar sauce between us. The tartar sauce is refreshing, and both the sriracha and curry mango sauces were slightly spicy. I liked all 3! The fish is juicy, and the batter is not too oily. The fried cod is not salty on its own, so the sauces are important. The fries are nothing spectacular. The peach & ginger lemonade is fantastic!  Overall, a fishy meal at un-fishy prices!",

The GR tartar is awesome,  but everything else is meh.  There's also no mushy peas included in the $17 dollar fish and chips order which is a shock, because GR always talks up a storm about mushy peas.  go figure.  Compared to the fish and chips you get in the UK,  fish is about on par but the chips are leaps and bounds worse.  They are dry,  and lack seasoning.  Granted, youre in the middle of a desert,  but its LV.  If youre charging $17+ for fish and chips,  they better be really good.",

    "text": "As our last Vegas lunch approached we made our way to this place...now for starters; I'm not a huge fan of fish and chips and deep fried stuff to begin with, but I do love me some sauces and so I decided to give this place a try as it was close by and we were hauling our luggage with us. My husband got the fishwich, which is basically a fish taco, with tartar sauce. The sandwich was good, and the fish tender and cooked well.  I opted to try the chicken since we already had one fish item, and their dirty fries with the chorizo, jalapeno and onion. Now for the chicken, the outside was super crispy which I imagine is how it should be, my only issue was I felt like all I could taste was the fried batter coating.  I found myself peeling off layers of the fried batter off so that I could get to chicken.  Of note, the food didn't taste bad, but as I'm already not a fan of deep fried food, I was just turned off by the coating.  The curry mango sauce, and sriracha aioli were pretty good, and the fries just tasted very busy.   The fries tasted like chili fries, but a dry version? The tartar sauce was my favorite.  The place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying their food, but if I ever find myself developing an affinity for fish and chips then perhaps I'll give this place another try.",

But maybe I went too early. I went like at 11:05.  Fish was greasy and in the serving size I had, I found about four bones in the fish.  Inside is nice.  Can see it bottle necking though in area to get malt vinegar and ketcup though.  Lemonade was great.  Fries seemed a bit hard.  Fish did seem bland.  Not as flavorful as the ones I had over at the Pub.  Maybe an off day,  Staff was very friendly.  Restaurant needs to work on consistency a bit more.  I might try to revisit one more time.

We went to the restaurant on its 3 Rd day, so I would not expect perfection, plus it's a casual low-key place that is self serve, so really no reason to be overly picky. I wanted the best fish and chips and I will say they were fantastic. Fish was hot, crispy seasoned batter, perfectly cooked fish inside. Chips were equally cooked hot and fresh and salty, exactly want I wanted and all at a great price. I would definitely return again.........But one complaint which I could not ignore, the server taking our order had the dirtiest fingernails, it really turned me off. I know it had nothing to do with the quality of the food (I'm glad she wasn't cooking my meal) but she was the first person to greet us and it really made a mediocre impression after that. If the front of the house staff can get away with that, what's going on in the kitchen side?? It's too bad because I could not find fault anywhere else.........I would have made this 5 stars except the one fault.:-(",

If you read the board in front of the registers you'll see their beer list, etc. as well as \"ask about our secret menu.\" We did and it was a super good deal on shrimp, fish and chicken with fries and a drink all together. I loved the sauces so much, we got the sriracha aioli and English mayo which is basically lemon aioli. Everything was so fresh and absolutely delectable! The staff was really nice and super helpful. They have the cool pop machine where you can make all kinds of crazy pop flavors. The decor is really neat and so fitting of the English/ Gordon Ramsey theme. The reason why I rated it low was because of seating. The limited seating and the crowd was so off. It makes for such a bad combo when you have hangry people who fight over seats, this one couple today is so lucky my boyfriend values his job over the seats they took from us or we'd have had a brawl. It's also annoying that people will save seats while their other person ordered because when the line is this long you shouldn't be allowed to save seats: the people in line ahead of you have time to get their food and eat and leave those seats by the time you order and get your food so saving seats is truly unnecessary and annoying as fuck.. #ihatepeople",

The downside is that the name \"Gordon Ramsay\" is connected with this restaurant so it's way more pricier than it should be.  $14.99 for a fish and chips combo? C'mon man!  We would be better off with going to In-N-Out and feeding 3 people. Without a doubt, you can skip any of the \"dirty fries.\"  I got dirty fries #1 and dirty fries #2 and both were MEH. (Dirty fries are another $2 on top of the $14.99 combo.) Regular fries are satisfactory. Also I recommend skipping the ginger lemonade altogether when ordering a drink. Way too sweet and they charge you another $1 on top of the $14.99 combo and there is no refill.  And you have to be mindful that there are limited seating option.  Simply not enough indoor tables and chairs. Lastly, stick with the following sauces: sriracha aioli, the tartar sauce and mango curry.",

The first bummer was that they got our order wrong and we received two shrimp orders. They did go ahead and fix it right away but it wasn't busy and it wasn't loud, so I'm not sure what went wrong there. While they fixed that we started in on the shrimp order, dirty #3 fries, and lemonade. The orange vanilla lemonade was amazeballs - it tasted like a lemon meringue pie, so delicious. The shrimp was pretty good, good serving, well battered, and hot. The fries were our second bummer - they were cold. Not hot, not luke warm, but rather barely room temperature. That being said, the seasoning was delicious, if the fries had been hot I would have been in heaven. When we got the fish order, the fish was just okay, cooked well, but bland.

    "text": "We had an out of town guest who said she loved fish and chips. As I had just seen Gordon Ramsay on the news at the ribbon cutting ceremony for his latest Las Vegas restaurant (this is #4 I believe) I thought we'd give it a try. As noted by others the wait is long. The menu is short but does offer a few choices even for those who don't care for cod fillets. The three of us shared one fish and chips combination and one shrimp and chops combination. The fish was excellent, crisp on the outside, not too much breading and tender and moist on the inside. I really liked the shrimp but my wife thought they were a little greasy and didn't care for them as much as my friend or I did. The chips were very good and the amount is really generous; the three of us didn't finish the two servings. As a Las Vegas local I can tell you that the prices are very reasonable, cheap in fact, for anything on The Strip. The only real negative is that there are few places to sit or even stand. Some customers ate outside using a trash can as a table, some sat at tables of other restaurants while we ate sitting on the curb. I would give it five stars if not for the inadequate seating. Regardless I think its great food for what it is at fair prices.",

It was the best and most expensive fish and chips I've ever ate. When I saw this opened I had really high expectations and doubts as to whether he can create the same dish that costs significantly less. I was blown away by it. The fish was fresh and the batter was crispy without being greasy. We selected the Dirty #1 chips and it was awesome. We love spicy, so the fried jalapenos provided a great kick with the chorizo. We will Definitely add this to our rotation of regular places to eat when we're in Vegas.",

I was so excited to hear about Gordon Ramsay opening up a Fish and Chips place but I was hoping that it wasn't all hype.  I have eaten at his Pub in Caesar's Palace and had the worst service which wouldn't fly in Hell's Kitchen.    This is an order at the counter place.  Not a huge menu but they do have chicken, sausage, and shrimp if you aren't a fish person.  The 2 piece Fish and Chips is $10.99.  Quite a bargain, if you ask me.  And imagine my surprise when I took the first bite of the fish.  It was the crispiest, freshest, tastiest piece of fish I have ever had.   The fries were good too but omg, the fish!  They also have a variety of sauces to choose from but I prefer malt vinegar for my fish and ketchup for my fries.  Old school style.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "As my brother-in-law was in town visiting, one of the places he did want to visit was the Linq and possibly ride the High Roller. It had been a while since I visited the Promenade and wasn't sure what would be good for lunch. Again, thanks to the Yelpers, I was super stoked to see that Gordon Ramsay recently opened up a Fish & Chips restaurant.   Luckily, it was a Wednesday and we got to Gordon Ramsay at 11:30 am. We took a few pictures in front of the restaurant before heading in. On the outside, the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing with it's UK theme, something I don't remember ever seeing in Vegas.  Pub chairs and counter-like seating is available outside (great for people watching).  Seating inside is limited, about 5-tables that seat four and maybe 12-counter seats.  As you walk in, there are two lines. However, on the day of our visit, only one line was open. Because we got there a little earlier, we were fourth in line.  And unlike Gordon Ramsey's other dining locations in Vegas, this is more a high-end fast food restaurant. So my brother-in-law gave me his order so that I could stay in line to order lunch while he grabbed a table.  The menu options are straight and to the point, fish and chips or at least protein and chips. Combo options included Shrimp, Chicken, Sausage and Fishwich. Protein and chips are between $13 - $15. Combos can include beer, sodas or lemonade for an additional $1 - $5. Chip upgrade options are also available for an additional $2.  My brother-in-law opted for shrimp and chips with Gordon's Tartar sauce and Euro Mayo, while I got the fish combo, upgraded my chips to Truffle/Parmesean/Chives, with Gordon's Tartar and Sriracha Aioli sauce. For my drink, I chose orange and vanilla lemonade.  The shrimp combo came with six very large shrimp while the fish combo comes with 3 strips. The breading was nice and light. Shrimp was good, but the fish, nice and flaky, so so good. Regular chips were good, but we could hardly stop ourselves from eating the \"dirty\" fries. Very addicting. And the chips aren't your soggy french fries, but very crunchy which is my all-time favorite.  Before I forget, once I got up to pick up our order, the lunch line was out the door. So like anywhere, you want to get here before or after the lunch and dinner rush.",

However, they do serve perhaps the best fish and chips I've ever had. When we went, at 3:30 on Tuesday between Christmas and New Years, the restaurant was packed, with little room to even move inside.   We made our way to the counter, ordered, and somehow the fish and chip gods smiled on us and we snatched one of the few tables (I think there were four, plus some seats against the wall) in the place. You might want to get your food to go if you're not as lucky. The drink machine, condiments, and order pick up are all in the same place, and were a solid mass of people. But we persevered and were rewarded.   The fish was perfect - tender, flaky, delicious. The chips were just as good. Nice and crispy and flavorful. David's shrimp were not as good as the fish, tasty but a little soft, but we shared, so he was not left out. Dipping sauces were good, the mango/curry is particularly good with shrimp. Be sure to get your vinegar packets and ketchup with your drinks because you don't want to have to navigate the crowd again. It was a hassle but the food was so good, I would certainly go back. And the people, although besieged, were very nice. Too bad the restaurant isn't 2-3 times as big though.",

The fish and chips are pricey...like $14.99 pricey. If you want to upgrade your fries to gourmet fries it'll cost you another $2. Do I recommend you do that? Why yes I do.   This isn't a standard fish and chips restaurant where they just slapped a famous person's name on it. The fish was great quality and the fries were so delicious (I got the truffle fries). There are also a variety of sauces which are pretty good to choose from. Are the sauces Chick-Fil-A sauce good? Not quite. But still good nonetheless.   My friend had the shrimp which I didn't find as delicious as the fish, but it was still good as it wasn't over battered like other restaurants that I have had.   The Lowdown: If you like fish and chips, give this place a shot. Keep in mind that this place closes at 11PM, which I find to be a travesty considering it is the strip in Las Vegas. The place is located in the Linq alley on the way to the big ferris wheel. It's also expensive...but then again you are in Vegas in the middle of the strip so what did you expect?",

You get what you pay for.. $14.99 for a combo which doesn't fill you up and make you sick to your stomach. The proportions are just right and the aioli sauces are something you've probably never had before. You'll never want to eat at your local Long John Silvers again!",

Light, but crispy batter, and inside perfectly cooked fish, not over done, still flaky and moist.  We had tried his fish and chips at the larger restaurant inside Cesar's Palace and were impressed, so decided to get a quick bite and see if this little place could hold up, and it did.  The choice in different flavored fries adds a nice touch to the variety of fish/chicken/shrimp fries.",

Fish and Chips is one of my top three favorite dishes. I will say that the dirty fry options are good, the fries (chips) were pretty dry and the fish was good, but not great. The thick Gordon's Tartar Sauce was was the highlight of the order. Also, the peach ginger lemonade is great, and the Sriracha Aioli is awesome for dipping the fries.",

The total was 34 dollars for a fish and chips meal included with 2 sauces and ginger lemonade + chicken and chips meal plus two sauces and an angry orchard beer. The chicken is very small for the amount of money paid, but very crispy and fluffy! The fish is a good amount, delicious, light and fluffy, airy, crispiest fish and chips I've tasted. The sauces are very complex and flavorful too! They add a lot of dimension to the meal. I got the mango curry sauce and the tartar sauce. I love the ginger lemonade. My only complaint was that it was so busy that there was not enough seating in the place (maybe because it's so new) so I took this to my hotel. Also, the lemon they gave is very small for 3 pieces of fish. It barely covered them. I mean, I understand that it is not lemon season, but surely, they could have given more lemon. I would come back! Delicious!",

Sauces were good - you can choose two of the same or two different, so we went with four different so we could sample.  My biggest gripe with this spot is that someone wasn't thinking when they decided to build/open this restaurant.  It's a celebrity chef spot for heaven's sake - you're going to need more than 4 tables and half a dozen bar stools. So be prepared to take your food elsewhere if you're going to eat here at the height of lunch time...we attempted one day at 1pm and gave up and came back the next at 3pm and I had to hover to snatch two barstools at the moment they were vacated.  It's nice fish and chips but get some more tables and space!",

Delicious dipping sauce (Curry & Mango for the fish and Southwest Ranch for the chips).  The dirty fries #1 (side order) were perfect.  Cool vibe & good music!  So why just the 3*?  The grease timebomb, that's why.  Finish our meal and we're walking down LINQ promenade when suddenly we're not feeling so hot.  Both of us, within minutes of one another.  Long story short, our first night in Vegas was effectively cut short because the heavily grease-laden fish.  And I'll leave it at that.    Typically this happens when the temperature of the oil isn't hot enough or the fryers are overcrowded.  Or both.  And looking back on it, those fryers were way too loaded and that more or less solves the mystery.  I'd love to recommend this place, but can't totally stamp my name on it because I wouldn't wish that feeling upon anyone.  On one hand the food was delicious - but on the other hand we felt like crap the rest of the night.  Although Vegas is all about taking chances and gambling... and you could do worse than 50/50 odds.",

It's not designed for large parties or even groups of more than 2. Seems like he intends for you to buy and keep moving like you'd do in London. There is a small outdoor seating area though. And when I say small, I mean it. Don't bring a large party here expecting to sit down.   Now, onto the star of the show - THE FOOD. Maaaaan. It was great. Like seriously legit. I ordered the shrimp and truffle chips and hubs ordered the fish and chips. We mixed, matched, and smacked happily because it all tasted so good. Everything was served piping hot and the service was great. I also appreciated the prices too - $17 for each and it came with a drink. It was a welcomed surprise from all of the price gouging we endured for eating on the strip.   This will be added to my 'must eat' list every time I go to Vegas. Run, don't walk.",

Wait was kind of long. When I got here at noon there was only 1 person on the line and 1 person at the register. After about a 15-20 minute wait in line, they had a second register open and more people cooking. Once ordering the wait wasn't long at all!   All in all, it was worth it - just be prepared for a wait!",

They said it was light and flakey. Seasoned perfectly and has a good crunch on the outer layer.   This location is small and ordering is quick. I got the lobster and shrimp combo, mango curry sauce & sriracha aioli or was it sriracha chipotle sauce? Lol The lobster was so good. Seasoned well, not dry. Not overly cool. Still a little moist.  And the shrimp was a good size and just as good.  I highly recommend coming here. It has become a new favorite for me.",

I decided to stop by for lunch and knew that the food would be good once I walked in and see the line and how packed the place was.   My family and I ordered a few fish & chips and fish & lobster. Both were ridiculously delicious. The fish was almost as good as the fish I had in London.   The only negative thing was that the restaurant dining area is very small. It took a while to get a seat for my whole family which was frustrating after walking the strip, waiting in line to order the food, waiting to get the food and waiting to get a seat to eat. Gordon, if you see this, please make a bigger dining area and I'm sure everyone will love this restaurant more.   Other than that, I will definitely recommend!",

Located in The Linq Promenade between The Linq and The Flamingo hotels, this place is small but stands out amongst the different restaurants and bars with its red telephone booth doors. There isn't as much seating as well and the line can go out the door depending on when you come.   FOOD: Don't underestimate the amount of food! It is SUPER filling! Each combo comes with fries and a drink for $14.99 - $17.99 depending on which entree you choose, which is a GREAT deal for being on the strip. I ordered the fish and chips combo, costing $15.99. The fish were perfectly cooked, having a thin and crispy exterior while the fish inside was still flavorful. The fries were also perfectly cooked with the right amount of crisp. We also ordered dirty fries #3, which is bacon cheese fries. I loved that the bacon was thick and was more like ham. All the flavors balanced each other out really well without being too oily.",

Service: the guy that took our order was polite, efficient, and didn't get flustered when we kept upgrading our combos.   Food: Simple, basic menu. Combos of fish, shrimp, lobster, chicken, or sausage. $15-$18. They apparently have a Fishwich, which is more like a fish taco, so we definitely passed on that. The fish was really good. It's 3 pieces of perfectly fried, flaky, tender cod that comes with your choice of 2 sauces. I don't prefer a ton of sauce, so the 2 little servings of sauce were more than enough. The sriracha aioli and cocktail sauce were my picks, the former being my favorite. The shrimp was also really good. 5 large shrimp, again, perfectly seasoned and fried. I only wish there were a few more.   The plain fries were good, but pretty ordinary. They give you a ton, which I'm sure is to make you think you're getting a lot of food. I upgraded mine to the Dirty #3-truffle Parmesan and was glad I did. The hubby upgraded his to the Dirty #1-chorizo, jalapeno, cotija cheese. They were super salty, but had a nice kick. We mixed them up with a few plain fries which was perfect.   We also had the peach ginger lemonade-super tart, ginger forward, and the pomegranate blueberry-also super tart, very floral.   The winner for the kiddo was the Biscoff cookie shake. We could've done without the marshmallow and pretzel sticks, which was just fancy window dressing for the star: that damn shake. It was so yummy. If you like cookie butter, you'll love this dessert. So good.   The joint is small, with minimal seating, all of which was taken. It was too hot to sit outside but there were no open seats anyway.    Prices are high for what you actually get, but are right on par for the Vegas strip.",

I went in not expecting too much but the fish was so fab! The deep frying was light but incredibly crispy and the fish was so soft & tasty, just overall wonderful flavor. The fish came with two dipping sauces - his special tartar sauce and a mango & curry sauce, loved both. The fries were just fine but didn't blow me away as the fish did.  It's not a big shop so you may have to count on taking your fish to go. If you do decide to dine in, they serve alcohol so have at it.

Seating can be rough. We were there on a week day at about 2pm. There is a handful of seats and tables inside, two tables with two chairs each and two bar type tables, one with four or five chairs, the other with two. We lucked out and snagged one of the bars as someone else was leaving. The wait wasn't too terrible to get our food, maybe 15 minutes total.   We love fish and chips. Love them. We've become pretty picky on the type of fish and batter we prefer and we knew going to Vegas that this place was on our must try list, and we were not let down. We got two orders of fish and chips and an order of shrimp and chips. Oh my goodness. It was amazing. I've never had shrimp and chips like that! They were huge, cooked to perfection and so so tasty! The batter wasn't too think and bready like we've found at some other places, it was thinner and had the perfect crunch. We also tried a different kind of specialty fry with each basket. The chorizo was our favorite! But the bacon and the Parmesan were also good! We tried all of the sauces they had to offer as well. The curry, chipotle mayo and the tartar were our favorites!   We could have eaten there for every meal and been happy as can be.",

When you've grown up in a life of luxury with straight out of the ocean goodness, there's no going back.  I figured if anyone knew fish & chips, it'd be Gordon Ramsay. Guys, I dunno if you know this, but he's a British chef! Lol  For ~$16 (+ tax), you get 3 pieces of Alaskan cod, fries and a drink (get lemonade, the citrus really amps up the meal).  The moment of truth! We broke apart the lightly battered fish and dipped into the house made tartar sauce. The fish was juicy and flavourful and the batter was crispy, not greasy at all. Definitely got my boyfriend's stamp of approval!  The combo was enough to feed us both, and being able to enjoy our meal al fresco was an added bonus. Absolutely worth the trip to come here!",

Shrimp & Chips comes with 5 large shrimp/prawns that are battered in a traditional style English batter. I also ordered a 3 piece Fish & Chips. The fish is cod and the portions are on the small size compared to a standard Fish & Chips served in the UK. I spoke with Chef Lisa who was managing the shop and she explained that the batter they use is a combination of Rice flour, All Purpose flour, Pastry Cream and water....the ratios she wouldn't share. Batter is crisp, light and the way a proper Fish & Chips should be. Chips are fresh cut and arrived piping hot like the Shrimp and Fish. There are several choices for sauces that include Gordons Tartar, Sriracha Aioli, Curry Mango and others (ask what's available). They all tasted fresh and complimented the meals.  I would have to say the Fish & Chips here are as good as any I've had anywhere in the US or UK.   We sat next to a couple from Glasgow Scotland and I was curious to see what they thought of the meals. Both gave excellent reviews, especially the of the Shrimp!",

The fries were ok, we ordered the regular ones so there was nothing to be excited about.  If we ordered one of the special fries they might have been better.  The fish was the most disappoint part.  The fish was ok.  I think the batter was what turned me off.  It was quite bland and did not excite me.  I have had fish and chips elsewhere and had good experiences.  One thing to be careful of is that it is a small restaurant with very limited seating.  So be prepared to stand if you go during busy hours.    Hopefully my experience was a once off, but based on what we experienced we won't be going there again.",

Overall: Initially, I had thought this place was over hyped, because it's by a celebrity chef. I am so glad that I was wrong.

    "text": "Ello ello! Looks like it's time for some of the ol' fish and chips. That's about as British as I can get, but at Gordon Ramsay's Las Vegas spot you don't need to be from \"across the pond\" in order to enjoy some wonderfully fried fish. You don't even need to be from England because Ramsay sure isn't (Scottish). All you need is an appetite, and I had that on the final day of my September Vegas family trip.   I wasn't the only one who wanted something aquatically fried as the line of hungry humans almost reached the door. It gave me a little time to check out the mildly British/fish & chip decor as well as deciding exactly what I wanted...not that it's complicated. Fish, chips (fries), a couple of desserts, and drinks make up most of the menu. You can also get sausage, shrimp, or chicken if you can't handle the usual helping. Though honestly, just get the fish. It's good. Really good.  Of course I did just that and went for a fish and chips combo. There are a few chip styles and so I optioned to get the truffle-parmesan-chive variation. Add on a few dipping sauces and a brew and we have a lunch that, though a little pricy, will blow up your tastebuds with flavor.   The cooking and building of each basket of fish and chips is like an assembly line, and you can totally watch as you wait around til your number is shouted out. The place is small so seating can be a dilemma. Luckily, I scored a corner spot outside and was able to enjoy my meal even on an oddly windy Nevada day.   Diving in (semi-pun?), I found the fish to be perfectly flaky and tender with a great breading around it. Sriracha aioli and the essential tartar were superb compliments to the flavor. As for the chips, they were wonderfully fried and had a nice taste to them, but I slowed down towards the end and found myself in a battle of flavor richness. Several fries found a home in the garbage instead of my stomach, but don't get me wrong, I'd order them again.  Overall, Gordon Ramsay knows how to fry up a piece of fish and it shows in each flaky bite. So the place is small and not the cheapest (what is in Vegas?), but it's worthy of curbing your appetite. Swim on in with your best British accent next time you're in Sin City.",

After spending 5 days and nights drinking here not sure if getting fried food was the best option for my stomach but half of our friends were getting In-N-Out and I thought this seemed better. I went in planning on ordering the fish and chips but actually got that with some shrimp. The fish wasn't bad but I think I actually preferred the shrimp. They were a good size and had seasoning inside the breading as well. Their sauce selection is awesome with a good variety of unique flavors and I highly recommend upgrading the fries to the dirty chips with truffle if your a fan of truffle. Those were amazing!! I'm not sure I'll ever come back if I return to Vegas but I am glad I went and enjoyed the meal. Service was also pretty quick considering there was a good amount of people there and the staff was extremely friendly.",

If you are staying at a hotel nearby, just order it and take it back. It comes with quite a lot of food. I ordered one to share between two people.

I got the chicken and chips and my friends go the fish and chips. In the picture they look similar. It is hard to tell them apart. The nice thing about this place is that the portions are considerably big and on top of it, they give you options on your seasoning on fries and your choices of sauces. The most popular sauces is the Gordon's tartar. But personally I thought the sriracha one was pretty good. Definitely recommend checking out this place. The combo deals are wonderful, comes with drinks, 2 special sauces and fries/ chips. The batter for the fish/ chicken made it very light and fluffy. I've never had it made like that before.

Perfect portion size and fast service, the line goes fast.  If you can't get a seat, walk a little further towards the high roller and sit by the fountain.",

    "text": "I've been to other Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Vegas and I've never been overly impressed.  Everything tastes good but service has been so-so and of course all the things were WAY overpriced especially based on portion size.  That is not the case for his fish and chips restaurant in the promenade between the Linq and the Flamingo.  It's tiny so seating can quickly become a problem if it's busy, but they do have multiple counters with stools for extra seating both inside and outside. We got one order of fish and chips to share (only $13.95 which is incredible for strip prices), and it was a great portion! Three pieces of fish and a huge amount of truffle fries. The fries could have used a little more seasoning for me but the fish was FRESH and delicious.  It melted in our mouths and the tartar sauce was just tart enough to add the little extra salty tang the fish needed.  I'm not sure about drink prices since we didn't drink but I would definitely come back!",

Would it truly give me a taste of UK food?  If this is traditional food, then, hmmm...not really in love.  Let me say that the place is clean and nice and tidy.  Busy, but that's more than acceptable.  The cashier staff was very helpful.  The food LOOKED amazing.  The prices weren't bad at all, either.  But, meh...not in love with it.   I had the shrimp.  The shrimp were HUGE, and properly de-veined.  They even add a little extra something where the vein normally is.  And the fries were mostly crisp.  But, the  GREASE...the grease is a lot.  The shrimp were way too greasy, and even though the fries were crisp, I could feel the grease building up in my stomach as I ate, pretty quickly.    So, understand what you're buying.  Yes, the biggest reason I stopped by was because I Masterchef, etc.  And know that this isn't the upscale dining that his other locations offer.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay is one of my favorite chefs, but man, oh, man.  This is how I'd rate his restaurants in Vegas starting from the best to the worse:    1.  Steak 2.  BurGR 3.  Fish & Chips 4.  Pub & Grill  Fish & Chip was honestly not all that impressive.  I don't know if maybe the place is so new that not everything has been straightened out yet?  Fish & Chips is located in the Linq Promenade.  It is not hard to find because the doors are red and look like English phone booths.  There is also a fire hydrant with the British flag painted on it.  Fish & Chips is a super tiny fast food type of joint where you line up, order & pay at the register and wait for your number to be called indicating that your food is ready.  There are tables and seats on the outside as well as the inside, but not enough for the number of customers that this place brings in.  The line was pretty long when we were there, but it moved fairly fast.  There is a large menu behind the registers so as you're waiting, you can see what is available to order so when you get to the front, you already know what you want.  Also, while you are waiting, you can watch the cooks preparing the food in the open kitchen to the right.  The menu is very small and simple which made ordering a little bit easier.  My bf ordered the Fish & Chips Combo which came with chips and 3 pieces of deep fried fish covered in batter for $14.99.  However, we paid extra to upgrade our chips to dirty #1 on the menu which is chips covered with chipotle, jalapeno, and crisp chorizo.  I ordered the Fish & Chips Combo and replaced the fish with sausage and upgraded the fries to dirty #2 which is chips with truffle, parmesan, and chives.  With each combo comes two sauces so we were able to choose 4 sauces altogether.  We chose curry mango, srircha aioli, southwest ranch, and Gordon's tartar sauce.  Not to sound like fatties, but we also decided to try out his Peach & Ginger Lemonade and Orange & Vanilla Lemonade which was $4.99 each.  As we were waiting for our food to be ready, I was looking around on the inside and outside of the eatery for a place to sit down and eat.  All of the tables were occupied!  There were maybe three tables and some counter space on the inside and maybe two tables outside of the whole place.  To be fair, Gordon did say that this place is not meant to be a dine in place, but how inconvenient is that when you're dealing with greasy foods?  I'm not going to take my greasy food and attempt to find a place to eat it elsewhere.  After scanning for tables like a hawk, this couple finally got up and I quickly took over their table.  The table was of course greasy and with crumbs all over the top because it looked like no one was there to wipe down the tables or anything.  It's basically a place where you sit and eat then you clean up after yourself.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the dirty #1 chips with the chorizo.  I thought that was different and it surprisingly went well with the chips.  I'm not a big fries person so that says a lot if I enjoyed it.  As for the fish, the bread was really thin and was falling off of the fish.  I have never had authentic English fish & chips before so I don't know if that is typical for the bread to fall off of the fish?  Anyway, it was kind of annoying trying to dip the fish into the sauce and then only being able to eat the fish since the batter had fallen off into the sauce.  The sausage and the truffle chips were okay as well.  It didn't blow me away.  As for the sauces, my favorite was the sriracha aioli.  The rest of the sauces tasted exactly how you would imagine they would just by their names.  Gordon's tartar sauce honestly tasted just like regular tartar sauce.  I liked the Peach & Ginger Lemonade way more than the Orange & Vanilla Lemonade, but they were both very sweet and I'm not a sweet fan.  Trust me, I'm no cheap skate when it comes to food as you can tell from my Yelp reviews, but I thought this place was overpriced for 3 pieces of fish and 2 sausages.  Out of all of Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas, I would rather go back to Steak and BurGR.",

What a treat for this to open soon after I came back - thank you for feeding my British withdrawals!  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the shrimp more than the fish here.  Like really enjoyed it - I totally recommend the shrimp and chips!!  It's also fried, but it comes with 5 pieces.  The shrimp tastes marinated, and are plump.  The fish was cooked really well, but parts of the batter were a little soggy.  Chips in England are usually more chunky, but these still suffice and tastes especially great with the sauces.  The mango curry tasted amazing on everything, but on the chips - I swear I had a taste of London right there.  My next favorite is the siracha aioli.  It's kind of garlic-y, but it works!  The ranch is a nice complement to the batter and fries as well.  I like the take-out concept, though I think the Linq Promenade might need a few more benches around to accomodate.  Plan ahead about drinks if you think you'll be walking around with food- your hands will be full.",

The fries were AMAZING and tasty (not bland like other places). They let you choose 2 dipping sauces. My wife got tarter sauce and ranch and I got tarter sauce and Dijon mayonnaise. All the sauces were awesome but the tarter sauce was the best. Definity a must go if you like fish and chips. We will be back for sure!",

    "text": "This is located outside in the Linq shopping promenade. It is not inside the hotel casino just FYI. You walk in and get in line, the line was short for us today which was great. There is a video machine on the wall that you can play with while you wait, it was so fun as you can see the video you made and then you click [send] and enter an email and off it goes. That in itself made the trip almost worth it LOL I love that little video machine we made three videos and it was our turn to order. My friend and I both ordered Fish and Chips and that was $16 each. It was fun going down the assembly line watching the guys make the food and the little setup it comes out in is the perfect little box of goodies. The fish is white and light and was tasty. The batter on the outside sort of tasted a tad sweet to me, kind of like a pancake batter. It came with three pieces of fish and fries. They have three kinds of \"dirty\" fries you can choose from, I chose the cacciatore spice w/fresh basil fries. They were tasty. My friend ordered fries with sea salt they were your basic fries. The food was good, one bummer was as busy as they were, they should know they need someone in the diner at all times cleaning up stuff. I am sorry to say the visitors that were leaving while we were there were not cleaning up after themselves. Is there some country where you just get up and leave your garbage on the table and walk out? Because wherever that is, that is where these visitors were from. I was shocked that the guy next to us took the box and threw it away but left his empty drink and napkins on the table - I was like deer in headlights as he just walked out the door. So it was a bummer when we found a spot at a barstool type bar facing the wall that there was trash askew that we had to clean up in order to sit down with our food. That was a bummer. Half way through my meal I had to get up and go let the manager know, the gal behind the register told me the manager was the chef - so he came over and I let him know there was trash on the floor, trash on the tables, trash next to me where I am eating because some I had to push away rather than handle it and worse of all - the trash can itself was over flowing. Ugh right? I was trying to make it through my meal without complaining because the food was good, but I couldn't do it. So I told him and he acted so surprised! \"There is trash on the floor?!!!?!\" I was like .. uh yeah! So he and another gal came out and began wiping down tables, and cleaning up the diner. It lets me down when a place has great food and is dirty, all the hard work put into the food is kind of worthless if the dining room is a mess. I could just imagine Gordon walking into this place with his name on it and the trash visibly over flowing out of the can.  In this case, the great food outweighed the mess and I enjoyed my visit, and I hope those that work there learn, in a busy Vegas establishment you got to have someone working the dining room at all times. Or at least, set a timer for every 15 minutes. Loved the fish xo",

I wasn't expecting too much after I walked in realizing it's a quick bite casual restaurant. I have to say, it was really good. Good quality products. The fish was crunchy and not over breaded. The fish didn't become soggy as time went on. The dipping sauces I tried were - tartar (it was good, nothing special or different about it), southwest ranch (tasted as expected and perfect accompaniment to the fries) and curry and mango (wow, really good with the fish and the fries, never had a sauce flavor like that before). Looking back, I should have given them all a whirl.  Bottom line - The price might be a little high given the portion of fish in a fast and casual atmosphere. However, prices on the Vegas strip are high all over. The fish is good, fries are good and you get a drink included. I was satisfied. If this spot was near me, I would definitely go again and probably...again. Really good fish compared to to some pubs and other places I've been to.",

The English use a very firm fish, whereas here the fish is pretty soft and ketchup as a dipping sauce would be such a no-no.  There was an English family visiting and I was eager to here what they thought about the food, so I sat close to them.  To my surprise they loved it - so go figure.

I ordered fish and chips & wife got the shrimp. Really cool to see the open kitchen and see the guys just whipping it all together. They served it to us in a cool little box with slots for they're dipping sauce. Had the tarter & mayo something i forgot. I killed both of the sauces, they were delicious. The fried food was crispy and flavorful and the fish & shrimp was tender and had good amount of flavor. I love this place, wish this was a bigger chain and had one near home..I would definitely travel for that!",

Then the menu is very easy to read and it has very simple choices. I got the fish and chips with Gordon's Tarter Sauce. The service was excellent. About 2 min after I ordered it was set and ready to go. I was very impressed because everything is cooked to order. The food itself was outstanding. The fish was totally fresh, because you can taste when fish is fresh. Got me that is a big part because I hate when restaurants have frozen fish because it doesn't taste as well. The fries were hand cut as well. After tasting many fries you could tell the freshness of the fries by the taste and the presentation of them. Gordon's tatter sauce was stellar. I normally don't like it but the way that all the flavors mixed was just amazing. It also wasn't to overwhelming where that's all you tasted. I would totally recommend this place to anyone because it has amazing fresh food for a great price.",

This time all I was eating was breading. Very disappointing consistency issues. The line was very very long so I didn't bother waiting in line to complain and then wait even longer to have the food remade. We just threw it away and ate elsewhere.

The fish and batter was not falling apart and everything was intact.  Not much to say about basic fast food, but it is definitely worth trying if you crave fish and chips in Vegas.  The only downfall I would say is that there is little to no room to actually sit and dine.  The idea of the area is to be very compact, so definitely go at a less busy time.  I highly recommend the sriracha aioli sauce.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to the opening for this Gordon Ramsay outlet. Since, Fish & Chips is a staple dish in the UK. Given the fact this place is owned by Gordon Ramsay. The few things I enjoyed about this place was the British ambience and the friendly staff. It would've been nice if there was more space because it felt very cramped and not so much seating. So be prepared to stand or take your order to-go.   The whole concept is counter service with a numbering call system when your order is ready for pick up. I ended up getting their original Fish & Chips combo with an upgraded Sticky Toffee Shake.  Onto the food. I was pleased with everything being served hot and fresh. The actual Fish was tender and soft with a consistent breading. However, it was lacking spices. The 2 sauces that I got were ok. The Chips(fries) was ok with a bland taste to it. My favorite item was the Sticky Toffee Shake, this was really good and balanced with the Toffee flavoring and the texture of the shake was very consistent without being to runy or thick.  Overall, I wouldn't come back here but would stop by for a Sticky Toffee Shake if Im in the immediate area. A good addition to the Linq Promenande for a quick service restaraunt.  2017 Yelp Review #14",

    "text": "First order of business while visiting Vegas this past St. Patties Day was to have lunch at Gordon's Ramsay's Fish & Chips however I ordered no fish. I had shrimp on the mind so Shrimp & Chips is more like it.   The menu is straight forward with your choice of battered fish, shrimp, chicken or sausages. The fries can be ordered plain or can be prepared three types of ways which then they're considered dirty fries. The \"#1\" which included chipotle, jalapeno and chorizo caught my attention so I had my chips prepared that way. In addition to the shrimp & chips, I ordered sausages on the side.  I was given some nice sized shrimp. I enjoyed both the taste of the shrimp and the batter that was perfectly crispy. The flavor of the shrimp is enough to hold it's own without dipping into any sauces but you'll be missing out if you choose not to. I tried four sauces (mango & curry, sriracha aioli, European-style mayo, and Gordon's tartar sauce) and the sriracha aioli was the best adding a lot more flavor to the shrimp.   The sausages were good but the sauce within the sausage takes away from the actual sausage flavor in my opinion. A thin beer cheese sauce is the best way I can describe it. They're good enough to try and possibly order again, however don't think sausage flavor and think of a flavor more along the lines of a cheese stuffed hot dog with the texture of a sausage if that makes any since. Last, the fries were decent. I'm glad I ordered them dirty. I tried a friend's fry which were plain and can say mines tasted a lot better. I couldn't tell what the chorizo was prepared with but it looked like little cheese crumbs. Not sure what it was but it tasted good.   Fish is within it's title so I couldn't go without at least trying a piece of a friends fish. It tasted pretty good but do prefer shrimp. In general, shrimp over fish any day for me. I had a great lunch and it was a nice way to kick of St. Patties Day in Vegas. I'll be stopping in for more shrimp.  Lunch 3/17/2017",

    "text": "I'd love to serve the food that we purchased here to Ramsay himself, and watch him tear it apart; bland fish, excessively creamy house sauces, unremarkable fries. While the food wasn't terrible, I did not find it to be extraordinary whatsoever. Having watched Ramsay's shows, I expected at least some level of speciality in a restaurant endorsed by him. What I received, however, was quite the opposite.   Before I dig in to the food (figuratively speaking of course, as I had felt no urgency to scarf down the actual fish and chips), I will state that the overall atmosphere of the restaurant itself was pleasant. Though not lavishly decorated, the interior did have an informal but homey feel about it and the staff was very courteous, with the hot and fresh food arriving in record time. Everything was neat and clean without a sense of congestion, despite having less space than expected in a Ramsay restaurant. I also appreciated the simplicity of a menu that avoided the necessity to boast a multitiude of options. Overall, the restaurant design nicely reflected the simple nature of fish and chips. The actual food, on the other hand, took the simplicity to a new level of monotony.  The fish did have nicely textured breading, but seemed to lack any sort of salt, let alone seasoning, in the flavor. This method of fish preparation doesn't require a great deal of seasoning, but at least minute amounts of flavor would have made the meal go down easier. Compared to other fish and chips I've consumed at run-of-the-mill seafood establishments, the fish here felt entirely lackluster.  The sauces were also a disappointment; even more so than the fish. All of the five sauces on the menu were much too heavy for my taste, and I honestly preferred to eat the fish and chips without them; my disinclination to consume the overly-rich consistency of the sauce held precedence over the flavorless nature of the fish for me. At the very least, I had expected Gordon's Tartar Sauce (given his name validation and all) to be satisfactory, but it was no better than the other sauces. My favorite sauce overall? The complementary, famous Heinz tomato ketchup! Familiar flavor with no innovation, but I thoroughly enjoyed it due to the much-needed flavor it added to the meal without leaving me feeling sick to my stomach.  I realize that my review is quite harsh and uncompromising for fairly average fish and chips, but this is for good reason. Before dining here, I've always thought of Ramsay as a credible chef, and generally trusted his opinions regarding various restaurants on his various shows without too much question. But, having watched him enthusiastically criticize seemingly conventional food (not terribly remarkable, but not as awful as he made it out to be), I expected better in a restaurant of his. A restaurant is best judged by the staple food on their menu and the fish and chips at Ramsay's restaurant were, in a word, utterly mediocre. More than anything, I am simply disappointed because Ramsay may be a brilliant chef himself, but his association with this restaurant--whatever his personal investment in it actually is--leads me to lose all respect for his opinion on his shows; if the food served here is the kind of food he endorses, either his taste or his own judgement lacks True expertise and authenticity.",

    "text": "I feel a little disloyal for giving a Gordon Ramsay property a 4 star review instead of 5.   But I have to keep it real.  I really do.  Anyone who knows me and reads my reviews knows that I am a HUGE fan of Gordon and his restaurants.  This was not a 5 star experience.   It was close!  Damn close.  But not close enough.   I hope that my comments here make it to management so that the next time we go, i can upgrade the review.   I've been waiting to go to GR Fish and Chips since about a year before it opened, when I first heard about it.  Life being what it is, we weren't able to go until Friday night.    GRFC is located at the far end of the Promenade, almost right across from Chayo, next to the Flamingo.  Its an adorable little chippy, and when I say little, I mean little.  Its small in here.  The idea was for people to get a box of fish and chips, and be able to walk around with it.  this is not a sit down restaurant.  there are seats inside, and there is seating outside, but its sparse.    There's one queue, and two registers.  I can see it being quite crowded when its busy.  It was pretty busy already, being about 6:00pm on a Friday night when we got there, but the line moved pretty quickly, after one HUGE group ordered.    Service was super polite.    Of course, my husband and I had to try the fish and chips combo. We tried 4 different sauces between the two of us, and also ordered an extra piece of fish \"a la carte\" each.  (Pro tip:  Don't do that.  The 3 pieces of fish and the chips are more than enough food.  We ended up not eating most of our chips, we were so full.)  We also ordered a peach ginger lemonade, and a sticky toffee pudding milkshake.   Lets talk about the food:  The fish was delicious.  The fish to breading ratio was perfect.   You know how some fish and chips spots will do a TON of breading for a tiny bit of fish?   Not Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips.  Cooked to absolute perfection, it was piping hot, flaky, glistening...BUT.  It was greasy.  They didn't let the fish rest and drain long enough, probably because it was so busy, but that was disappointing.  The first piece was really really greasy. Some of my fries were too.  Gordon would have been appalled, to be honest.   The chips...well, ok, they were fries.  They aren't traditional British chips, but they were still good.  We did the dirty #1: chipotle, jalapenos, and chorizo:  tasty, but difficult to eat without a fork, and the dirty #2: cacciatore spice and fresh basil:  really good.  Easier to eat without a fork, but in order to get all the yummy basil, I needed a fork.  Next time I'll likely try just the natural sea salt chips.   We also tried out a bunch of awesome sauces (see what I did there? lol) My favorites in order: 1. Gordon's tartar sauce 2. Curry mango 3. Sriracha aioli 4. Southwest ranch  They were good, and honestly, we probably didn't need the 2 extra that we got with our extra fish, but they're included, so why would we not try them?   We had a peach ginger lemonade, which was perfection.  It went really well with the food, as it cut the richness and the grease.  It was a little small.  I'd like a slightly bigger drink.   The piece de resistance was the sticky toffee pudding SHAKE.  I've loved every incarnation of this dessert that I've tried so far, and the shake was absolute perfection.  Sweet.  Thick.  The most amazing toffee sauce on top...I'd go back JUST for one of these.  Seriously.  Amazing.   Pretty close to a 5 star experience, but just not quite there.    The greasy fish, I'm really sorry, is unforgivable.  Gordon Ramsay kicks people out of the kitchen for greasy fish...I know y'all are busy, but let the fish drain and rest.    Also, there REALLY needs to be someone stationed in the dining area to wipe down and clean up as guests leave.  I understand that this is hard to do with such a quick turnaround time, but if a fast food joint can have clean tables and eating areas, so should a Gordon Ramsay property.    There were pieces of fish and fries on the floor at my feet, and I unwittingly stuck my arm in crumbs as I sat down to eat.  Gross.  People should clean up after themselves, sure, but...most people are lazy and inconsiderate.  I made sure to wipe down our area at least with a napkin for the next people, but...an employee really needs to clean up the spots when people leave and as people are waiting for their food.    Correct those two issues, and it will be a 5 star spot, no problem.  Its definitely one of the more affordable GR spots in town, and as much as I hate being on the Strip, I'd head down here again in a heartbeat.",

Over all I thought it was good but it  tasted like any ordinary box of fish and chips. Loved the food and the place but I was expecting a little more from Gordon Ramsay.",

I am going to be brutally honest, I expected so much more & my mother, who has no appetite due to chemotherapy, craved fish 'n chips.  Tides & Tommy Bahama at GVR has way better.    I ordered two Fish 'n Chips, both w/ the Tarter Sauce, one Mango Sauce & SW Ranch.  Truffle Parm Fries & regular Sea Salt.  Two Merlots, a Chardonnay, peach ginger lemonade, regular lemonade, $66.   I am not trying to waste time, money or calories, but I feel I did both for a special occasion.  Also, as we waited for our number to be called, we started to smell something fishy.  The Truffle Parm Fries gave my mouth a bad taste & I wished that I  had a toothbrush to brush it off.  The inside of the fried fish was nice & flaky, but there was zero flavor.  I needed vinegar, hot sauce or seasoning to fix the flavor problem.    I am truly disappointed & rate him as my number ONE chef's because of his outstanding restaurants here.  I love them so that this one experience has no impact on my opinion of him or his other restaurants.  I will not be back to this one.  The 'selfie photo frame' as you wait in line is cool & I like the outside decor.",

The place is quite small with two 2-tops and one 4-top and some counter seats inside.  Additional counter seats are outside the restaurant.    Small menu with five items: fish, shrimp, chicken, sausage, fishwich + chips.  Each combo comes with a drink and two sauces.    There are five sauces to choose from: Gordon's tartar sauce, sriracha aioli, curry and mango, SW ranch and Dijon mayo.     Ordered the fish and shrimp combos and upgraded one of the chips to dirty #2 (Truffle, Parmesan, chives).  I was expecting it to be good given Ramsay's name but didn't expect it to be this good! Freshly fried with crunchy batter and nice moist piping hot fish fillet inside.  Most importantly, it's not RAW! Shrimps were just as good.  Tried four different sauces of the five except the SW ranch.  I liked all of them but my faves were the Gordon's tartar and sriracha aioli.    The only complain I have would be you only get 3 pieces of fish and size varied.  My box actually has about 2.5 pieces because the third piece was half the size of the other two.  I looked at my neighbors  and their three pieces were bigger than mine, bloody unfair!   Now where am I going to find something like this back home?",

The fries was meh, nothing special. The fish was just average. To think that I paid more than what I usually do for an order of fish and chips make me regret coming here. So disappointed",

As you would expect the prices are on par with fast food. You get three pieces of fried cod on top a bed of French fries. Fish has a nice light crispy crust on them, Fish is light, fresh and flakey. The shrimps are also breaded in a light crispy flakey batter. Inside the breading is tarragon herb coating on the shrimp. It's a nice way to get something from the TV personality brand for less which is typically very expensive.",

The food is good, really good, but there is an obvious focus on \"grab and go\" business.  The seating inside is extremely limited, outside is slightly better but not what one would expect for a celebrity chef's place in Vegas.   The menu is extremely limited in options.  You pick a fried protein, you pick toppings for your fries (chips), and you pick dipping sauce.  That's it.  Job done.  Not exactly world class cuisine but definitely comfort food elevated to the level that you'd expect for a place bearing Ramsay's name. The sticky toffee pudding shake was pedestrian, fitting for the location.  Perhaps PH would allow the pushpops from BurGR to make a showing.  All in all, a great addition to the Strip food scene.",

Order the toffee pudding shake and the fish n' chips.  I love sweets, I do. I can demolish a box of Ding Dongs, Zebra Cakes, Cosmic Brownies without batting an eye. My go-to dinner is an ice cream cone followed by a slice of chocolate cake. I'm KNOWN for eating sweets on a daily basis. But this sticky toffee pudding (too long a name) shake was overbearingly sweet. I took a sip and felt my teeth chatter and my insides tightening up. What did you put in this? 2 pounds of sugar?! I highly urge sharing this drink between 3 people. It's too much sweetness for one person.   Fish was dripping oil as were the fries. It was good at first but then the amount of oil began to creep and make me feel nauseous. Ugh  The drinks fountain is touch screen. You are eating fish n'chips with your hands. Hundreds of people are touching that screen to select their drink option. Think about it. Definitely wash your hands before picking up those fries.",

    "text": "Although it's Gordon Ramsey's, it's not a sit-down type of restaurant. They have some seating both inside and outside, but not nearly enough to accommodate everyone coming through any given time.  It's fish and chips, how could it go wrong, right? But here, they prove that it can get better. The batter is different, different varieties of dipping sauce, and house made lemonades.  I had fish and chips with tartar, Sriracha aioli, and orange vanilla lemonade on the side.  Visited there around 5:30pm on Saturday. Seats both indoor and outdoor was fully occupied. Line was long but moving quickly.  We placed order. The wait time wasn't bad ether, probably about 6 or 7 min.  We couldn't find any seating indoor and resorted to sit at outdoor table for an Italian gelato store (?i think) across the street (the table had sign designating the table for that gelato store, but they didn't seem to mind us sitting there as there were no one from their store needing seating at that moment).  They give you plenty of food. 3 good portioned fish and a lot of fries. I couldn't finish all the fries. Batter, which my husband describe as \"like funnel cake\", was very light and fluffy, yet crispy and crunchy outside. Fish inside was cooked perfectly, very juicy and flakey. The highlight of this place, I think, is dipping sauces. Tartar isn't your ordinary tartar. Sriracha aioli is good on fish or fries. My husband had mango curry and European style mayo for sauces. They were good too. My #1 was Tartar, #2 goes to Mango Curry.  Overall very happy with my experience. Type of joint I'd take my out of Vegas visitors to.",

    "text": "I have to preface this review with the fact that I don't like fish or seafood. At all. I was not about to try anything from the sea here, so this review is only for the non-seafood I had.  First of all, the decor is great. It's well-designed. It's a small, fast casual place, but they make good use of the space.   The service is very friendly. They seem to have a good sized staff, so no one gets too frustrated waiting.   I ordered the chicken combo with dirty #1 fries. The chicken originally came out a bit raw, but the expediter caught it before she gave it to me. They refried the chicken, which took longer, but I was appreciative that I didn't bite into raw chicken.   I have never been a big fan of beer batter, but this is really well done. It is so crispy and not at all soggy. The chicken must be brined, which I enjoyed. It does seem to be a combination of white and dark meat. I would prefer straight white meat.  The dirty fries #1 were good. I enjoyed them, but I do wish they had a bit more spice. I was expecting more of a kick, since they have jalapenos. I also did not expect onions, but I just ate around those.  My dining companion had the fish and chips. He really enjoyed the fish, but he felt the fries were too salty (I liked them, but I like salty).  Overall, it's a good place. It's expensive, but you're on the strip and at a restaurant attached to a well known name. I expected the higher price.  Good job, guys.",

You don't ever see a employee let alone a head chef do this. Big props to the team at this location. She gave me her card and sad to say I list it. Hopefully I can get in contact with her someday again.",

The sauces are good, the drinks are good. The vibe is fun. A decent meal, I paid $52 for three of us, so Vegas prices, but not bad.  Gordon is always reliable when it comes to great food!",

Everything is made to order so it's fresh, hot and so tender and crispy!  On the 2nd trip we both had the fish and split a side order of the shrimp.  I tried the dirty fries and that was so delish!  The service was great too, the workers were so friendly and the food came out fast. We've had fish & chips in London but somehow this was just more memorable.  I would highly recommend eating here, I just wish they had more seating.",

Gordon Ramsay is someone I highly admire, so of course this was somewhere I wanted to check out. Let me say the decor here is super cute. I love the front doors resembling telephone booths. Unfortunately, I was very hyped to try the sticky toffee pudding milkshake. The sticky toffee pudding at Steak was one of the most divine pieces of food I've had in my lifetime. I was expecting a milkshake with a big chunk of pudding blended in, but instead received a pre mixed shake straight out of a machine. This was disappointing as it had NO flavor of the dessert I so deeply love. It tasted purely of whipped cream, so that was disappointing. The fish was $15 for three rather small pieces. It WAS very good, but not worth that much. The service was excellent, and the food came out quick. The dipping sauces were also fantastic. Unfortunately this place missed the mark for me and I will not be back.",

Both were really good but not your typical tartar sauce. Prices are good based on Vegas setting and being a GR restaurant. I've paid more for fish and chips in Michigan and not nearly as good.

To have the opportunity to actually try his food was beyond anything I could have dreamed unfortunately, upon trying it I was disappointed. We stopped in for dinner last week. When we walked in we were greeted by a very fishy smelling storefront, which I thought was fine. It's a fish joint. It should smell like fish. The girl at the counter turned out to be a fellow Missourian so we chatted for a bit as all Missourians do, about the weather. So far so good. The food was ready quickly, we both ordered the fish and chips with a few interesting dipping sauces. We sat down outside on the front porch and took our first bite into the infamous Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips. It tasted like nothing. No flavor to the somewhat mushy fish or to the oily and bland batter. The chips were okay. Not great. We didn't end up finishing our food. It was tasteless and greasy. Instead, we went next door and had a hotdog. I feel like this wasn't the best sampling of what Ramsay has to offer. Based off of everything I've seen, this wasn't up to his standards let alone mine. I wouldn't try the fish again but I would venture to one of his other restaurants and see what that's like.",

It's a great deal for the Strip!  +DECOR: It's always clean and the decorations are really slick and have character. There's a photobooth thing that you can use while waiting in line.  +LOCATION: It's right on the strip in the Linq, and there is some seating (not much) inside in case it's super hot. (Side-note: we went this past weekend and I felt like the 'alleyway' the shop is in is cooler than other parts of the strip)  +SERVICE: You don't have too much interaction with the staff, but they are always happy to provide you with more sauce, bags, etc. if needed  +TASTE: I'm a bigger chicken person than a fish person, so I get the chicken chip combo. The breading on the chicken is different than the fish and I personally enjoy it more! The chicken breading has some good seasoning and chives embedded into it, something I hadn't seen before. It made for a great taste!",

The first thing I noticed upon entering was the smell of grease and fries and fish bubbling away in vats of grease. Pretty disgusting, so hubby placed his order and I decided I didn't need to drink grease. I just couldn't muster the ??? needed to order all that grease. Out of curiosity, I did try some of hubby's fish, on the soggy side, soggy with grease... and pretty bland, like flavor drowned out by grease. I'm glad I didn't part with cash for grease here, but if your diet lacks grease or you really have been taking healthiness too far lately, have a go at it.",

It is also not greasy which definitely helps! I highly suggest the truffle fries which is delish! You have the choice of choosing your dips, I selected of course the tartar sauce which is amazing & also chose the sriracha aioli which was yummy. In my opinion I think the price isn't bad esp since you're in Vegas! I definitely didnt mind paying $15 or so for good food! Plus they give a good amount of fries which i was not able to finish. I highly & definitely recommend going  to Gordon Ramsay's  fish & chips restaurant to try it out! I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas! Like other yelpers it is hard to find a spot to sit & enjoy your meal. My family & I got lucky & was able to find a table inside since it was cold the day we arrived. I hope Mr. Ramsay will open a fish n chips joint in LA since he already has a restaurant out here.",

Literally melted in your mouth. Best fish I've tasted. I guess it's a good reason that it smells really fishy inside lol just don't eat inside of the smell bothers you. Fries are good too. On top of that you get to choose 2 sauces out of like 6 options to dip your fish and chips in. I got the mango srriacha and garlic aoili and they were both so tasty. I ran out quick. My boyfriend got the tarter sauce and a mayo ranch sauce and he also enjoyed it. Seating outside is limited but we just ate across at the gelato seating outside. No biggie. It was about $30 for 2 combos.",

The ordering process was simple; you pick if you want fish/sausage/chicken/shrimp and chips, two sides, and if you want a fountain drink (they have the customizable machine) or lemonade for an up-charge. The food was ready by the time we walked from the cashier to the drink machine and filled our cups, very impressive. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and we chose to sit outside.  My boyfriend and I both ordered fish and truffle fries with the tarter sauce; he also got the sriracha aioli and I ordered the southwest ranch. The fish was amazing; good quality and not overly greasy compared to other fish I have had. The best part was the truffle fries...absolutely amazing, especially dipped in the ranch or tarter sauce. The portions initially appeared small, but filled us both up upon finishing. The total for the two of us was $36 with the truffle fry upgrades, which was entirely worth it.   Only downside to the restaurant is it is difficult to find; it states it is in the LINQ but is actually in an ally next to it. But, now that we know where it is, it will be a for sure destination for us the next time we're in Vegas.",

However, with a limited time in Las Vegas, I only managed to try out this place, but I was fully satisfied afterwards!  I got the 3pcs fish and chips, with the Siracha Aioli and Tatar sauce.  The fish was cover in a not too thick batter and deep fried til golden brown and crispy. The size of the fish were not too small, worth the price! Both of the sauce were amazing and go well with the fish and chips! My fav is the Siracha Aioli as it has a nice kick to it!  I love the decor of the place, classic and boldly yell \"England\". Great location, easy to find!

The vibe in restaurant is less formal than other Gordon Ramsay restaurants. Worth to try at least one time. But I will come back for fish n chip for sure.  Highly recommend to come here!",

I asked the guy behind the counter if I could get a replacement because I told him the chips tasted stale. He gave me an attitude and reluctantly gave me a replacement. As I was waiting for the new chips, I was thinking to myself, how much could the chips be for the guy to haggle with me over the replacement? Sadly, the replacement chips were stale as well. The menu does not give you an option to get the fish by itself. So you always have to get the fish AND chips together. Next time if I decide to go back there again, I am going to ask if I could just get the fish by itself only. It is obvious that Chef Ramsey has high standard and pays attention to details. You could tell by the quality in the fish. I am just surprised that he will let his staff serve stale chips to his patrons.",

    "text": "We ate here last night and boy was it good!   Yes, the menu is a bit confusing but long story short you can have fish, shrimp, chicken or sausage and fries aka chips. For an up charge you can upgrade the fries and it comes with 2 sauces (you'll have about 5 options).  Yes, just like the other reviews say, the food is oily but it's FRESH out of the deep fryer. I'm no rocket scientist but I patted it down with a few napkins and it was fine. We ordered fish n chips and shrimp n chips, we upgraded to some spicy fries and had one beer. We had tartar sauce, Siracha Mayo and cocktail sauce even though it's not on the board. Everything was great. The only fish n chips that I've had that are comparable would be (of all places) the Cheesecake Factory.   Dinner was almost $50 including tip. After we paid there was a short wait followed by the struggle to find a place to sit. It's a small place with few tables so we just sat outside on some tall bar stools.   The complaints would have to include: *Portion-MORE SHRIMP PLEASE (at 5'5 130lbs I easily could have eaten twice as much) *The nearly frozen cocktail sauce-tasty but it was thick and literally nearly frozen *The lack of seating-the name Gordon Ramsey alone was going to bring folks in, they could easily fill a large pub with customers and to fit us into such a small space with little seating makes no sense *Ketchup-if you give me fries, give me ketchup, it shouldn't be an option on the menu, it's a given!  If we are in the area we will be returning or if we have family that's visiting (we are locals). It's a fun area near The Link and it's a yummy stop and go kinda place. The food also kept me from being too hungover after date night!",

The staff was friendly and helpful.  The fish was cooked perfectly and delivered hot out of the deep fryer. They provided three (4 inches) pieces along with plenty of chips. You get to choose from a good variety of tasty sauces. The sauces were the magic trick of flavors. It just made the fish fantastic. The fish pieces could have been more like 6 inches. Hey yo, we are big Americans with healthy appetite.   Overall, I would go back to get my fish & chips fix at Gordon Ramsay Fish &a Chips.",

It's worth it to spend a couple of extra dollars to get a lemonade and order your fries \"dirty.\" I went with truffle oil and Parmesan. For some reason, the parm didn't want to stick to the fries, but they were so yummy. The ginger peach drink was out of this world, but super sweet.

You approach the counter, place your order, receive a chit and wait for your number to be called.  It was very crowded and when I got up to get my order a play was made for my seat and smack was talked about me in German when I reclaimed it.  I ordered  the Fish and Chips @ 14.99 and paid the 2$ extra to make my fries Parmesan Truffle fries.  You also get a soda which you fetch yourself from a machine and the aggressive tourist couple trying for my seat made me refrain from getting a refill until I was ready to go.  The Fish consisted of 3 crispy good size pieces.  I don't think the parmesan truffle fries were a good choice with the fish. The fries were very crispy tasting like they were twice fried. You get 2 sauces but I just stuck with the traditional tartar sauce. The service is friendly but it is strictly counter and the seating is problematic.",

    "text": "I may be a fan of Gordon Ramsey; however, the fact that this is his doesn't affect the rating of this review. I'm giving this restaurant a four star because it deserves it.  The fish is cooked well and doesn't taste frozen(lol). The fries are great but not the best fries I had in my life; however, they are less greasy than most fries, which I really like. There's a varieties of sauces; however, none really captivated me. Some were pretty unique, but they weren't outstanding. Keep in mind the place is very busy. When I exited, they were already running out of a sauce and had to make a new batch after only being open for an hour. This could because of the poor management though.  Overall, I think this is a decent restaurant to have some fish and chips. Even if this wasn't by Gordon Ramsey, I would still visit again when I visit Vegas.",

I got the Fish & Chips combo plus import beer for $20 including tax. I tried the Sam Smith Chocolate Stout. It was smooth and had creamy character. The chips (fries) were perfectly crisp and seasoned well. The fish (came with 3) was moist and the batter was hot with a good crunch. It lacked seasoning but I think that's the way they prep them because they do offer 2 kinds of sauces per order. I tried Siracha Aioli and Curry Mango. I prefer the Siracha cause it had just the right amount of kick.  Overall, the food quality was excellent and the service was very polite and professional. They do not have a lot of seating but this place is more of a fast food / to-go concept than a full-service restaurant.",

The fish remained moist and flakey.  The batter was crisp a bit greasy which I enjoyed but paid for it later.    They make dirty chips.  This is not a bad thing. I opted for  DIRTY #1 fries (Brits call me chips but they should not be confused with potato chips) mixed with Chipotle, jalapeno, and chorizo.     Lines are long but it moves quickly.  In case you're bored there's an interactive video postcard machine to play with while you wait.  Seating can be an challenge with only a handful of tables and small bar (sitting not drinking) area.  Outside there are a few more stools and bar counter -- again no booze.    I'd go again but I'd share it with a few people as it's very rich. Plus I'd be packing some antacids for the after burn.",

We got the 3 count fish n chips with dirty fries #3 bacon, bacon, cheddar fries with sour cream and chives and the fishwich. We ordered the fishwich a la carte, just have to ask.   The dirty #3 fries reminded us of a \"deconstructed\" baked potato. The fish is cod and the batter was delish. Tartar sauce is creamy and had a nice sweet pickle finish to it. Also tried the siracha aioli, not too spicy at all and a nice change for your palate. Cassie loved her dijon mayo sauce, balanced between the two flavors.   The fishwich includes the same fish as above, but in a pita-like shell with pico and a guacamole. Totally different experience with the same fish. Both good, but I enjoyed the standard fish n chips as it highlighted the battered fried fish.   Fries were very good. Only complaint was the lack of firmness. \"Bacon bacon\" was what I think to be pork belly. Big chunks, very generous with hunks of cheddar cheese.",

The lobster was absolutely destroyed in her trunk in to the size of a cork inside the batter. I do have to say that the batter was pretty tasty but it was fried food and it was just OK. I have enjoyed his other restaurants much more. Once you place your order you can stand around in a common area waiting for your order to be called. From the time I ordered to the time I got my food was 22 minutes. That is way too long for some french fries too fried shrimp and fried lobster tail. Also if you want to get a drink if the squeeze into a very tight area that again as crowded with people waiting for their food.",

The line moves along really fast and the menu is limited so we got our fish & chips and were able to get seated outside (luckily some folks were leaving so seats open up) on a very windy day.  The fish was really really good and the chips were amazing.  I got the garlic flavored (#3 option, I can't recall the exact name) and managed to finish about all of them, which is amazing because I rarely finish all of my fries in meals like this.    The tartar was really good but the sriracha sauce was even better, heck my wife loved it too and she's not normally a fan of sauces like that.  I'd really recommend this place if you want to eat a really nice meal of fish & chips (you can get shrimp and some other seafood too if you're not a fish lover) for a reasonable $15 or so on the Strip.  Now I want to check out Gordon's burger place!",

I think they went a little crazy on the dipping sauces, which might slow down the line a bit (too many choices). My biggest complaint was the seating: there simply isn't enough of it. My friend and I were there on a weekday, mid-day, and there was nowhere to sit once we got our food. The eating area in the restaurant is kind of small, and there are only a few tables outside designated for their restaurant. I think that's not very smart, and it would deter me from eating there again. I felt like an idiot, wandering around trying to find somewhere to sit while my food got cold.",

I got to watch who I think was a manager because they were having issues with the soda dispenser as the guy was explaining to her the problem she got down right into the machine and was taking care of business and as she got up to leave she started bussing tables and picking up crap on the way to the back, great to see a hands on manager!

    "text": "My wife and I recently visited Las Vegas for our anniversary. As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Saturday night around 9:45pm we decided to give Fish and Chips a try! After visiting both the Pub and Steak I had high expectations when it came to service at anything with the Gordon Ramsay name on it. Upon arriving we were immediately greeted and able to order. I had explained to the guy behind the counter that we were visiting all the restaurants and after having the sticky toffee at both pub and steak, I couldn't wait to try the shake version here. He went on to tell me how great it was and how it is his favorite. I ordered the fish and chips (you can't beat a classic) and told the young lady taking the order that I would like the toffee shake as well. She then proceeds to tell me how they already closed down the shake machine for the night. Its 945pm on a Saturday in Las Vegas and they chose to start packing up shop? I understand the want to begin closing with only an hour left in your day, but to take the only dessert option you have completely off the menu for anyone to order because you decided to close it down early.... REALLY?!?! .... and to do this on a Saturday a prime day on the strip after I walked all the way there from my hotel specifically for that shake was very disappointing.The part that was worse, is after I order it and am informed that shakes are no longer available, there was no sympathy or care. Clearly the leadership at this store needs to take a page out of the service book at the other three GR restaurants, because they do NOT put the customer first.",

My boyfriend and I weren't all the hungry but wanted to try the fish &a chips, so we shared an order. $20.00 for a fish & chips combo, including one drink, and an extra drink. They have a cool Pepsi machine, similar to the Coke Freestyle machines, but unlike the Coke one you are able to add up to three different flavors. I stuck with just abnormal Diet Pepsi, I know boring. Once we got out order I was even more excited, until I took a bite. The fish looked amazing fried to a golden brown, but the bottom side of he fish was soaked in grease! YUCK! I could hear Gordon Ramsay's angered voice and I took a bite. I could barley finish the one piece. It seemed as if they didn't even give the fish time to drip off the excess grease. I stuck to the chips and my soda. Safe to say I left only semi-satisfied and disappointed.",

I don't really like Gordon Ramsay b/c he yells at people on Hell's Kitchen so I docked one star for that. You attract more bees with honey. The restaurant was small. No room to eat inside nor out on a busy evening. We ended up taking our trays up to the hotel room at the Flamingo. So if you don't have a room at The Linq or The Flamingo, there's a good chance you are eating and walking. All in all its a great, efficient restaurant.",

Long line made it very crowded and there isn't nearly enough seating inside.  We just went with the basic fish n chips combo.  Were very pleased!  Generous serving of chips that were topped with herbs and a little cheese.  The fish was fresh, well cooked, flakey, and not greasy.  My hubby is from the UK and said it's better than what you get in England -- they serve it in newspaper because it's greasy.  For Vegas, a very reasonable lunch.  For Ramsay, a downright cheap lunch! lol Certainly wish there was more seating.  They should've expected it to be popular and everyone shouldn't be crammed in shoulder 2 shoulder.   We would've been disappointed if the fish wasn't good but they delivered.  Will definitely return on our next visit and try some of the different sauces.",

Being from England and now living in Seattle I was excited to go here because I miss English fish and chips, plus I was really excited to see a fire hydrant painted in the Union Jack colors!!! We both had fish and chips and it was delicious I ate the lot however I was kind of sad to see fish was in fact goujons and the chips were what I'd class as fries not chip shop chips, of that makes sense!!  Also the addition of mushy peas would've been nice to have as a side, the curry mango sauce was so yummy.  All in all great meal!!",

    "text": "Fresh and delicious. So crispy and fresh. The fish itself was so crispy and fresh its unbelievable. They use fresh Alaskan cod. They have 2 different sizes one with 2 pieces of fish and one with 3. Its like a 2$ difference between them so I suggest getting the 3 piece. You can make it a combo for a few more dollars and for 5$ more you can get a milkshake. I got the sticky toffee pudding shake. It was ok nothing special. I wouldn't get it again.  The fries are fantastic. So crispy and delicious perfectly salted and hot. They are not greasy either. You can upgrade to one of the dirty fries, but the regular ones are great.  The sauces are amazing. You get 2 per order. My 2 favorite ones are the tartar sauce and mango curry. The mango curry is fantastic I would definitely get that one. The ranch and spicy mayo are good too.   Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would definitely be back.",

    "text": "Considering this is Gordon Ramsey's Fish and Chips restaurant, I had very high hopes for it.  In the end, it was just mediocre.  We ordered a fish and chips and a shrimp and chips.  The batter for the shrimp had much more seasoning than the fish.  I couldn't even taste any salt in batter for the fish.  And considering cod used for fish and chips is typically pretty plain taste wise, it definitely could have used some salt.  The size of the shrimp was pretty impressive.  They could have easily gone with smaller shrimp but did not. However, the pieces of cod used for the fish and chips were quite small.  And the chips were fries... not chips.   The organization of where the condiments were compared to where the soda machine was didn't seem very thought out.  For a pretty busy restaurant, there's only enough room for 1 person to sort out all their condiment and utensil needs before the next person can.  So if the person in front of you is trying to pour themselves 2/3 cups of ketchup but you just need a straw, you'll have to wait.  Overall, I would not visit this restaurant again even if I was in the area.  I would save my money for Slap Fish.",

He has cooked fish and chips so much, and made it a challenge on his shows, and it makes you want to reach into the TV and grab a bite.  Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips is located in The Linq Promenade.  It's a quick order, casual restaurant where you order and pick up.  There are various fish types you can order, and you can also order your chips jazzed up as well.  You get a choice of sauce as well.  Combos come with a drink.  There is very limited seating inside and on the outside front patio, so snag a space while someone orders.  The fish and chips were crispy and simple, but they didn't completely blow my socks off.  Overall, it was an experience, especially for a Gordon Ramsay super fan.",

The curry mango was my favorite, due to it's slight heat, while the euro mayo was just too light tasting in general for me. The shrimp was nicely done as well as the chips(fries) I also ordered the Peach & Ginger Lemonade which was very good the only downside to this meal was the price, but I guess because of the novelty of the Gordon Ramsay name and the fact that it's on the Las Vegas strip made it more expensive then it would normally be.

    "text": "Living in Arizona, it's tough to find a good fish & chip meal so I was excited when I finally got a chance to visit Gordon Ramsay's newest restaurant in Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips.  It's located in the Promenade at the Linq somewhat in the middle of the shops. I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be a full on sit down restaurant with waiters? Would it be a little takeaway chippy shop like you would find in England? Turns out to be a combination of both. You can stand in line, place your order then wait for it at the end of the counter and hope you can find a seat at a table or outside on the railing counter.  The prices weren't too bad considering it's Vegas and a Chef Ramsay joint.  A fish combo with a basic drink can be had for $14.99. I obvi decided to upgrade my drink to an import beer (which was a short pour btw) for $5 more.  Eating and drinking anywhere for $20 in Vegas is not a bad deal really. I am used to getting nickel and dimed for the most part so getting a bit of a value put me in a non horrible mood.  I was expecting to get a large piece of fish but instead was served up 3 smaller almost fish stick sized pieces. Also, wasn't sure what to expect for the fries but they came out nice and crispy and very tasty. They reminded me of fries I would get in a Canadian fish and chip shop. Definitely not similar to an authentic fish and chip shops in England but that's fine with me, I'm not in England after all ffs.  All in all I was very satisfied with the whole thing. How can you really screw up a meal where everything is deep fried though? Load that shit up with Malt vinegar and ketchup and we're good to go!  The ordering and picking up is a bit of a clusterfuck and could have been thought out better I think. Would I go back? Maybe. Maybe not. There are so many choices in Vegas I am not sure. I am just glad it was tasty and I have been to all Ramsay places in Vegas as I am a yuge fan.  To make it more English authentic they need to offer gravy and charge 20p for a packet of ketchup. Yes can you believe that shit? Fish and chip shops in England hose you for a bloody ketchup packet!!! UGHHHH!! Also, it was very clean. If you want that True Brit chippy shop feel everything should be coated in grease and dirt.  I give Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips 4 stars.",

    "text": "Best fish and chips I've ever had. Perfectly flaky fish, with a crunchy outer shell. The sriracha aioli was my favorite sauce, among it, the mango curry, and the tartar. Upgraded to truffle fries- NO REGRETS! Thicker cut fries, so they do get a little soggy as time goes on, so eat them fast! Combos come with a drink, and it ended up being around $18. Definitely not cheap, but worth it.  There's also a secret combo, that comes with shrimp, chicken, and fish. If you want a variety, go with that! With an upgrade to truffle fries and a drink, this one came out to about $21.  If you enjoy fish and chips, this is your place!",

Having said that the food here is good, and better than most of the 'fish and chips' I've had in the states. The menu is simple and small and being Vegas it is on the pricey side, but if you're in the mood for fish and chips,  stop by.  I do wish they had some pies on the menu, a good strak and kidney would be awesome! I would give 3.5 if I could, but ill leen to 4.0.",

I liked the idea of a quick stop for fish and chips on the Vegas Strip, but the execution disappointed.   The decor was fun and the counter service was friendly, but the food was the downfall. The fish and the fries were both too greasy for my taste and my fellow diner agreed. Also, the batter needs better seasoning as the fish was bland.",

I decided to join her as were looking for something quicker than a sit down service restaurant.   The name basically says it all, they serve fish and chips! They do offer the fishwhich, which look like two fish tacos. They also serve fried shrimp, and what seemed to be just seasonal, lobster tail. I decided to give the fishwhich a try as it has a cilantro sauce with tomatoes on top. For my taste, it was just ok. Maybe my stomach wasn't up for it after a week in Vegas, if you know what I mean!   My friend got the fish and shrimp but we both really enjoyed the shrimp the most (yes she let me steal one... or two). She got them with dirty chips aka truffle fries, which she loved! I see myself going back, why not, but this time for the shrimp!",

More so the fish than the chips as I prefer my fries a bit more crispy. The fish was cooked to perfection though. It was pretty pricy for what it was, but on the cheaper end of a Vegas meal. You get two sauce options, so I recommend getting tartar sauce + whatever peaks your interest.   There is a line, but it moves fast. There also isn't a ton of seating.   If you're in Vegas, I definitely recommend trying this place!",

Would i return? Heck yes! But WE will not order the house chips... stick to the amazing fish and chips... .....oh yea also the fries could have been fresher/Hotter but our cod was HOT enough that it kept Our FRIES warm.",

    "text": "03/10/2019 Yelp review Fish & Chips  Las Vegas NV  Gordan Ramsay Fish & Chips 3545 Las Vegas Blvd S Las Vegas, NV 89109  (702) 322-0529  During my recent spring break trip to Las Vegas. My date and I stop at Gordan's Fish & Chips because of numerous great experiences that I had from past trips to Las Vegas at this place. As always, our lunch here was delicious. My date especially enjoyed sampling from the numerous selections of special sauces at this place. luckily, we arrived just before their evening peak hours and waited no longer than 10 minutes before we were ordering our food. However, the only downside to everything was the seating and cleanliness of the dining area. When waiting in line we were greeted by the friendly manager who asked if we had been here before. I replied, \"Yes, however, my date has not\". The manager immediately asked if she wanted to sample the sauce that they offered with each entree. This way we could help expedite the process at the register. Before long she was trying three sauces called the Gordons Tartar Sauce, Southwest Ranch, and the Curry & Mango. Overall, the customer service from the beginning was above and beyond.      Once we finally arrived at the register I ordered the usual shrimp combo that I always have   While my date ordered the fishwich combo and an additional two-piece fish entree that we both wanted to try. The price for the combos were $15.99, $14.99, and, 10.99 respectively and we were also given the option to select two of the six sauces that they had listed. We both selected the Mango & curry, and Southwest Ranch because of the tasting experience while waiting in line. For our fries, we asked for naturally sea salted fries which were included in the combo's price. Finally, for our beverages, we upgrade our drinks to two domestic beers for an additional $2 each. The overall price for our evening lunch was reasonably priced at $45.97 plus sales tax.   Once we finally placed our order it was quite difficult to actually find seating and the area that had a seat available was only for one person. We just ended up standing until our food was ready. Unfortunately, once we finally had our food and found a table it was quite a bit messy where we planned on sitting. Out of desperation for seating, we asked one of the cooks if they could have someone clean our area so that we would not lose our seats. Luckily, they immediately had someone clean our table with baby wipes and the rest of the dining area. The music that was playing was quite soothing and matched the tone set by events taking place in the area. The place even seemed child-friendly despite being within casinos, bars, and having alcoholic beverages served in the restaurant. This place truly felt like you could bring your family and kids despite the surroundings.   When we finally received the opportunity to enjoy our lunch the food truly meet the expectations of my date and I. The fishwich tacos were delicious and included a variety of different vegetables, and seasoning to enhance the flavor. Most notably we could take the fresh avocados, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The presentation was clean and clearly showed the ingredients with the entree. The fish entree was a nice brown color, crispy and savory when you ate into each piece. It was also not too hot and tasted like fresh not frozen fish. The presentation was minimal with cilantro and half cut lemon, but the freshness of the fish made up for the presentation. Our last item the Shrimp combo was also minimal in presentation, but you could taste the quality and freshness of the seafood and ingredients used. This best part of the food was truly in the quality of the sauces especially the Mango & Curry. This sauce was both sweet and beautiful colored in the presentation of the dishes. Overall, the quality of the food was above expectation and left a memorable dining experience for my date and I. My overall experience at Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is 4 out of 5 stars.",

They deep fry the shrimp in the same oil they do their fish. So if you have a SHELLFISH ALLERGY like I have, eating at Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is a DANGEROUS game of Russian Roulette.  In my case, I caught it early enough that I was able to take oral medication. However this is something that needs to be addressed.",

    "text": "This is the best fish & chips I've ever had! The line is long but they move fast here. The wait to get food isn't that bad either. It smells very strongly like fish in here, but I don't know what else to expect out of a place that serves predominantly fish!   I really like the whole British theme going on in here. The food comes in a British flag box. All of the music playing over the speakers is British, such as The Beatles and Billy Idol.  I really love this place. I almost want to order more. Would that be weird? You can get chicken here too if fish isn't your thing.  There are a ton of dipping sauces you can get with your combo meal too. Please stop by, this is so good!  One complaint: the seating is terrible! It fills up fast and you have to work hard to get a seat!",

    "text": "This Fish & Chips place was on my list for the next time I would go to Vegas so I was happy to remember that when the opportunity arose. The restaurant is located in the busy alley that leads up to the High Roller and is kind of a refreshing change among your typical burger/pizza joints in the area.  Here are my ratings based on different criteria:  Quality of food: Good. On their menu, they have Fish, Shrimp, Sausage, and Chicken served with Chips (a.k.a fries). When the restaurant is named Fish & Chips, I don't know why you would not get that on your first visit. The Fish was very crispy but also very greasy. At times I had to remove the fried batter to be able to really taste the fish. For the sauces, I got Curry & Mango and Southwest Ranch. The sauces tasted gourmet and paired really well with the fried fish.  Decor: okay. The inside feels a little cramped and I don't think there is sufficient place to sit down. The outside has a cool Union Jack painted fire-hose and the entrance looks like a pub.  Cleanliness: mostly good. I did not see anybody actively cleaning the tables in this high foot traffic restaurant.  Service: okay. Neither the staff nor the kitchen folks smiled or looked very welcoming. They looked a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of crowds that kept coming in and in.   Speed of food preparation: slow. They seem to bring orders out in batches. So, you may have to wait 10 mins for your order # to be called but it's usually a batch of orders.   Price: a wee bit on the higher side. What stinks is that even if you're not a soda drinker, you have to buy a combo which was $16 for me. I wanted just a cup of water but they said that I can't do that.  This is a good option if you're looking for fast food that is something different than burgers or pizza.",

My usual order is the fish and chip combo with truffle/parmesan fries and peach/ginger lemonade. For sauces, I recommend the curry/mango and the tartar sauce. The fish is always fried fresh and so flakey. The fries are also delicious and fresh with plenty of truffle and parmesan topped on them. The peach ginger lemonade is refreshing and citrus-y, and you can get it spiked with grey goose vodka if you wanted that extra kick!",

The chips were terrible, they had a metallic taste to them. I am not sure what type of potatoes they used but it was bad.   I was born in the US with parents from Birmingham England. I do not call myself an expert but have been to England a couple dozen times. Besides Balti my first thing I get is usually doner meat and chips so I do know chips. If Gordon served these chips in England he would be out of business in no time.  I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay expected much more. I will stick with my local chippy in Alhambra CA.  I think it is the best in the states.",

Even fried fish from other fast food places is not this greasy. Also, it was a cool night in January and we planned on eating inside. There are very few options for seating and one counter faces a plain wall away from windows or restaurant. Overall, would not recommend you try this place.",

A plate of fish and chips ranges from $15-$19, a little pricey but I can understand in Vegas. The place was clean and servers were kind. Seating arrangements were difficult to find, as there are 3-4 tables inside and 2 outside. We ended up outside.   I ordered the shrimp and chips, regular flavor chips. And my partner ordered the fish and chips with flavor truffle Parmesan. The shrimp was good and king size, my only suggestion is let it sit on paper or something because it was greasy. Beyond greasy. My partners fish were just as greasy. It was crunchy though! The fries were cooked perfectly.   Don't get me wrong, this place was good but the grease did not sit well on my stomach.",

It was really easy to order since the menu is designed to be simple. The lady who took my order gave me some suggestions and she also checked my ID when I payed which I really liked. not a lot of places do that.   I ordered the fish and chips with the upgrade on the chips called  Dirty#1  for $2 more which means they get cotija cheese, jalapenos, onions, and sausage. And it came with a fountain drink with the option to upgrade for a beer or lemonade.  I also ordered all of his sauces because why not!? Everything is made fresh to order and the wait for me wasn't  too long. I'm sure it depends on how busy it is.   Fish and chips- THE BEST IVE EVER HAD I mean just the quality of the fish was everything!! So so crunchy on the outside and nice and flaky on the inside so moist it was absolute perfection. The batter had some really nice flavor too.  Con: The only thing is I wish the fish would of rested on a paper towel a little longer because it was a bit too greasy. Then again it is fried food just keep that in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.  Chips: I could of done without the Dirty upgrade. It was tasty but Next time I'll keep is simple with the way it comes. I also wish the chips had a thicker cut they looked like regular fries really nothing special to them.   If you are in the area price point and location definitely match quality! This place is a must! I will be back.",

But wish it was little more crisp because it was falling apart! Also great dipping sauces to give it that extra flavor! Can't go wrong with it !",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I was on a mission to try all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Las Vegas.   Ordered: - Fish & Chip combo with Dirty #1 fries (Chipotle, jalapeno, pork chorizo, red onion, chives, parsley, and cotija cheese - Lobster & Shrimp combo with regular fries  - Sticky toffee shake - All dipping sauces (Tartar, curry & mango, sriracha aioli, southwest ranch, dijon mayonaise, and cocktail)  Whoo hoo! We finally got to try Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips! My boyfriend and I enjoyed all the sauces. If I were to choose a favorite sauce, it'd probably be tartar but all were pretty on point. The batter on the seafood was delicious. It gave the perfect crisp without being overly greasy. However, my boyfriend and I didn't really care or the Dirty #1 fries. We just weren't too crazy about the fries and the flavors just didn't mesh well for us. Oh my! The sticky toffee shake was sooooo yummy! We really like his sticky toffee dessert at his steakhouse, so we had to try every sticky toffee dessert at all his restaurants. You won't regret it!  Overall, pretty solid place. Pricing isn't too bad either.  NOTE: DO NOT SIT AT THE OUTSIDE BAR closest to the frozen alcohol spot. I GOT POOPED ON TWICE! TWICE!! WITHIN 5 MINUTES.   Yeah, being pooped on made it a little hard to enjoy my food, but when I come back, I am sitting inside away from all those birds!!",

Fish & Chips: Here at Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips, the fish is served in smaller pieces. Batter is light. You get to pick your 2 dipping sauces. You can upgrade your chips aka fries to their dirty chips for a few bucks extra. 3/5  Dirty #2 Chips: Truffle, Parmesan cheese, and chives. Mine were served a bit cold and weren't crisp. Flavors seemed mild 3/5  Lobster & Shrimp: Now, this, was really good. Good portions of fried battered succulent lobster and shrimps. 5/5  Pomegranate Blueberry Lemonade: Refreshing. Tart and sweet. Get this if you don't want to be bothered by standing in line at the soda machine that nobody seems to know how to operate. 4/5  Sauces: What I've tried were curry & mango, sriracha aioli, southwest ranch, Gordon's tartar sauce, and Dijon mayonnaise. The only thing I didn't try was the cocktail sauce - I mean, why though? The sauces pair well with the seafood and chips. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the curry & mango was - don't knock it til you try it! 4/5  It seems to always be busy here but don't get intimidated by the lack of available tables. By the time you place your order and actually get your food, there's usually a spot that opens up. Remember to clean up after yourself, folks!",

I have seen his Youtube video of him making the fish n chips in his kitchen and it looks so delicious.   After walking around the Linq casino for a couple of hours I was ready to eat some fish n chips! The line was not too long and you can see orders being prepared. This got me more hungry.   The fish was terrific as the fish was season well and  it was fried to perfection. When i dip the fish in the tarter sauce it was  As for the fries they were terrific and it went well with the sriracha aioli sauce.    The inside is pretty small so it might be hard to find seats if you are in a large group. But the good thing is that the tray box they put the food in you can walk around the Linq promenade and eat.",

I recommend the fish. The lobster and shrimp are good, but the fish (cod) is the star. You have your choice of two sauces with each meal, I recommend one tartar and then go crazy with the second sauce. I have enjoyed all I have tried.  The biscoff shake is over-the-top and delicious. I also liked their ginger lemonade. Overall it is pretty straightforward. If you like fish and chips and shakes, this is the place for you.

    "text": "We recently stopped by this fish and chips shop while we were down at the linq promenade. It's a small shop, with a bit of seating inside and outside, and an open kitchen where you can see everything being made. We got there around 11:30 and soon after, the shop FILLED UP. So if you are going during a meal time, keep in mind that it may be very busy, and you may need to take your food and walk down towards the linq fountain if you aren't lucky enough to find a spot indoors or out.  Now to the food: I had the fish and chips (due to that being what the shop is advertising as being their thing) but they do offer fish sandwiches and shrimp, sausage, and lobster. My fish was hot and flaky, I enjoyed the fries with the mango curry, and my choice of the tartar sauce to go with the fish was great, as it was tangy and had a rich flavor.  The combos, which come with your choice of the above listed fish or meat, fries, 2 sauces, and a fountain drink, range from 14.99 to 17.99, which isn't bad for food on the Vegas strip.  I may be biased due to my love of Gordon Ramsay, but I think this fish and chips shop delivers on the good food and is a good price for being down on the strip. If you're looking for a good lunch (especially if it's an off time) I fully recommend this spot.",

You have to pay for parking in back, walk through structures, buildings, hallways and casino, it's crowded, there's construction so if you don't mind that... or if you're on foot walking the strip it would easier I think to get to this spot. I had to work at The Linq on this day so perfect, I thought. I'm going to FINALLY eat fish & chips. I was soo excited!  Location is small & narrow. It was crowded. All seats were taken. Line to order was very long. We waited for awhile before we ordered. The girl who helped us was nice and patient for being so busy.  You get to pick two sauces with your order. You can pay extra for dirty fries and if you can pay extra to spike your drink with alcohol.  Overall:  Fish & chips were good  Nice mild fish taste, light batter.  Shrimp & Lobster were good  Lemonade strong tart taste. I wouldn't order that again. Blueberry lemonade was ok.  Sticky toffee  They probably tasted better warm but I ate them later at home so they were cold.    I would go through the parking, crowds, casinos and traffic to eat here again.",

I've been to a variety of Vegas eateries from high end to low end, but I think this place deserves a special shout out. I ordered the shrimp and dirty truffle fries, and my meal was excellent! I still think about the truffle fries. They had the right balance of oil and crispness and were so well complemented by the dipping sauces (sriracha aioli & tartar sauce). I'm a shrimp lover and so I enjoyed the battered shrimp. It's hard to find a seat bc this place is small, so I would recommend going off hours.",

You walk up to the cashier to order your food and then they will call your number when your order is ready.  I went with the standard fish & chips combo. You get to pick two dipping sauces. I tried the curry mango and European mayo (to dip with fries as they do in Belgium and the Netherlands). I must say, Gordon Ramsay did a great job with this place. The fish was light and flaky, not dense and greasy at all, and I loved the curry mango sauce. Next time I'd probably just get curry mango sauce for both of my sauce choices.  If you're looking for an inexpensive celebrity chef experience in Vegas, make sure you check out this place.",

    "text": "After trying the fish and chips at the Pub & Grill in Caesar's, I was so disappointed. So imagine my excitement when I saw this shop dedicated to ONLY fish and chips pop up in the LINQ promenade. I was ready to give Chef Gordon a second chance.  The decor of the shop awesomely UK-themed. You know how there are some places that are just oozing with American flag decor everywhere? You won't miss this place as you walk down the alley -- just look for the British flag, telephone booths, and British flag-painted fire hydants.   When we walked in, we were greeted nicely and the workers helped guide us through the menu. The fish and chips can be ordered on its own or as a combo (which means it comes with a drink). We decided to get the combo with sriracha aioli and southwestern ranch (recommended by the worker) and a sticky toffee pudding shake (which was an additional $5 -- discounted by a couple of dollars because of the combo).  We got our shake first. Every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas has its own rendition of the classic English dessert, but this was definitely not a winner. (Pub & Grill in Caesar's is still my favorite.) It was a bit too sweet for our liking, but definitely thick like a shake should be.  Then, the glorious fish and chips were ready. We got three hearty pieces of deep-fried fish fillet sitting atop a bed of perfectly fried chips. Each piece of fish was piping hot, crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and absolutely what I imagine the best fish and chips to be. The fries were also crispy and golden. Having a variety of sauces in addition to the traditional tartar sauce also makes this place stand out, especially since I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce.  Totally worth it if you're looking for a quick but filling bite! (And definitely worth it if you're a GR fangirl like me.)",

Compared to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants this is like a fast food restaurant. I got the shrimp and chips combo with fries seasoned w/ Parmesan, truffles and basil. I also got the orange vanilla lemonade and it was very good. There is extremely limited seating. Customers were also rude and continued to sit at tables after they finished their meal so if you ordered food you just had to stand there until they got the hint, or take your food to go. The best part of my meal was the fries. The shrimp has very thick batter, I prefer the batter that is thinner. Anyway, I might return in the future but will try other places before I return here with such a high price tag. My meal was $20.56",

But when you see those big chunks of fish sitting at the top of the cardboard plate (Box) you know you are in for a treat. Fish fried to perfection it just falls apart in your mouth, chips (Fries) made to an excellent crisp. If that wasn't enough you have a choice of two dips to choose from curry mango, Sriracha aioli, southwest ranch (My favorite), Gordons Tartar sauce, European style mayonnaise, and Artisanal Ketchup. All of which are absolutely excellent. But I also cannot end this review without saying thank you to the AMAZING staff. After I ordered they got backed up with customers to all of which received a smile with excellent service on top.Though I was only in Las Vegas on vacation Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips was definitely one of my highlights here and will definitely be coming back again next time.",

Fish was perfectly crisp, but fell away from batter quite a bit. No big deal, though. You get two sauces with your order. The sriracha aioli was the best! Regular tartar was good, but not super special. Mango curry was ok.   Upgraded my chips to dirty fries #2 (parm truffle), which was also very good flavor-wise. Flavor evenly distributed throughout all the chips/fries. A little too crispy for my taste though, but maybe that's how the British have their chips. Total with upgrade & drink was $16.99.   Their peach ginger lemonade was also very yummy. Very tangy though, but that's how I usually like my lemonades.   Service was great! Fast, efficient, polite. Good job =)",

For everyone on the Vegas strip that's craving something fried, this is the place to go.  Food: 4  Fish and Chips: Each order comes with 2 sauces. I chose the curry mango and tartar sauce. They make a great tartar sauce that has just the right amount of acidity, and the curry mango was interesting although not my particular cup of tea. The chips were well fried and seasoned. The fish was perfectly fried. It was flaky and moist on the inside and the crust was thick and crispy. My only complaint is that the fish was a tad oily.  Service: 4  Like every casual eatery, you order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. The staff member that took my order was patient, and food was served very quickly.  Ambiance: 4  I was able to grab seats for my party of 3 by watching the tables like a hawk, but finding a seat can definitely be a problem in this tiny eatery, especially in the Vegas crowds. There aren't many seats, so I wouldn't suggest eating in for a larger party (aka +4 people).",

Also ordered an extra 2 piece of fish and they do offer extra pieces for a cheaper price if you don't want the combo, its just not on the menu board you just gotta ask. Our meal came out super quick and hot. We got the tartar sauce and the sriracha aioli for our dipping sauces. The sriracha aioli was my favorite. The fish was perfectly cooked super moist and flakey. The breading was fried perfectly as well super golden, a little oily but it's fish and chips it's going to be a little oily. The fries were cooked well but the parmesan and chives weren't mixed in too well so there were just chunks in certain spots and some had none and I've had truffle fries before and it seemed like they put way too much truffle oil after eating it for a little it became overpowering. Pretty good fish and chips and super nice cashier.",

The fish is high quality and the fries were delicious!  Comes hot and crispy, but it's quite on the oily side -- you probably know that coming into this anyways.  The fish and chips combo ($15) comes with a drink and two dipping sauces to choose.  Loved the siriacha aioli.  This is a bit on the pricier side, but you're in Vegas and it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, what do you expect? :)  This place is pretty small with limited seating.  His whole concept - takeaway style, so keep note!",

We have tried all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas and to us this one came in last place. Just FYI Gordon Ramsay's Burger was easily the best out of all of his properties in Sin City.",

As a local, it comes across a little tourist but I will go back to try the fish sandwich. Warning... it is a little pricey for what you get and for the overall experience.

Any good chef knows that fries need to be cooked twice. First blanched, then fried hot for a crisp outside and fluffy inside. I'd never had a fry that tough. On top of that, it was difficult to get into the shop. I am handicapped and riding a mobility scooter.  One of the doors was broken but no one put a sign on the door saying that. Difficult to get in with such a small shop, plus the price was high for what we got. Very disappointed, I expected better from Gordon Ramsay. Won't go back.",

    "text": "I went to Fish and Chips and thought it would have more seating . Once inside I found out there are only about 20 seat available for the entire restaurant including the very small patio seating outside making up half the seating. Yes only about 10-15 people can sit inside and eat the rest maybe able to sit outside, maybe. This is really the biggest issue with this location is the amount or lack of seating available. You will have to either wait for people to get up so you can sit or split up the party as I had to with just a party of 4, 2 at one table and 2 across the very small dining area sitting at another. The food was mediocre. I had great fish & chips while my 3 other guest did not. Fish was way over cooked for 3 of the dishes, another had tarter sauce that could have just been called dill sauce. Fries over cooked for 3 of the 4 fish and chips plates we got. So overall I think it is a risky restaurant to go to, cheap food for Vegas but the quality is not what you would think Ramsay would put his name on. With only having my food be good I felt guilty sitting there enjoying my fish and chips while my guest just looked at what they should have got. We could have asked for them to make it again but after the line for lunch and waiting to get our food it had already been close to a half hour and we were all very hungry. So my advice, go here but know that you will be taking a shot at either good food or very bad food. Since I had a great meal it is most likely I will go back just not at a lunch time hour on the weekend.",

You get two big fish chunks per order, chips, and two dipping sauces. Between the two of us, we had the curry, tartar sauce, house mayo, and Sriracha. Favorites were the tartar and curry! Ketchup is an option, but it's also free in packets. Add a beer for a few bucks.   To me, the chips fell flat. They were good, but I've had better fries elsewhere.  Store is a little awkwardly laid out with limited seating. There were people going across the street for a table because there simply weren't any chairs or bar areas for them to eat at.  Service was quick; I think both our orders were out in the 5-minute range but def not more than 10.",

    "text": "As an American servicemen with a British wife and stationed in England for over 13 years of my career, we love a traditional fish-and-chips meal. As residents of Las Vegas for eighteen years, we have tried  fish-and-chips in many establishments throughout  Las Vegas.  We recently celebrated my wife's birthday and the family decided to try Ramsay's fish and chip shop. I must say we felt severely let down.  Upon arrival I must agree with other reviews that the shop was very small and cramped and we had to fight just to get a seat. At the time we were there, all tables were dirty and the garbage cans were overflowing. No one on  staff appeared to be taking any notice of the condition of the restaurant nor made any effort to clean the tables and surrounding areas between numerous guests leaving and new guests seating themselves.  Most of my family ordered fish-and-chips which upon inspection of our boxes had the appearance of stamped out rectangular lumps of mass produced fish. It did not resemble anything that we remembered from your standard fish and chip shop in Britain. When reading the menu my wife was excited to see they had sausage and chips and when she asked about them she was told that the sausage was not British but Italian, most disappointing. Most of our fish was very wet inside the batter which led us to believe that it may have been frozen as they were getting people in-and-out so quickly I thought it may  not have been cooked all the way through.  My daughter had the chicken and chips which was less than stellar and I must say I have never tasted anything like it in Britain so I don't know where  the recipe originated from.  I would imagine the fish-and-chips aren't bad if you've never been to Britain but if you have tasted the delights of Britain you may want to try Ri' Ra's Irish Pub in Mandalay Place. It is by far the best fish-and-chips that I have had in Las Vegas and serves whole pieces of fish.",

So it's funny how a $15 box of fish and chips can have us losing our minds! We got the fish and the upgraded fries with truffle and parm and chose the European Mayo sauce (mayo with lemon and something). It all worked together SO well! The truffle wasn't overwhelming, it was just right. And the fish was so flaky and the batter just amazingly crispy and light, SO good!

    "text": "We stopped by here to finally try it. It finally gave me a reason to actually go to the Strip haha. It's in the Linq so if you're about to go on the High Roller but you're hungry, I recommend coming here. The place is very limited on tables so if you come with someone, have one of you wait for food and the other find a place to sit! It's cool because you can watch your food being made. We were greeted by Taylor. She was the cashier and she was very nice and knew what to recommend. She offered to have us try a sample of the different shakes so we can decide on that as well. No matter which of Ramsay's restaurants you go to, ALWAYS get a shake. They're my absolute favorite.   So you can pick from fish, shrimp, sausage, and chicken here. We both wanted to try fish so we both got the fish meals. For $1 more, you can upgrade your fries from standard fries to ones that have certain seasonings. I got the cacciatore and basil fries while my boyfriend got the chipotle, jalapeno, and chorizo fries. There's a lot of cool dipping sauces to choose from.  You can pick from sriracha aioli to curry and mango. I love that you have multiple options because most of the time you just see ketchup and tartar sauce! Now for the shakes, we tried the biscoff shake and the toffees and brittles shake. It was probably the hardest choice of my life, but we ended up getting the biscoff one. It tasted just like a gingerbread cookie so it was a little hard to resist. The fish was amazing. It's perfectly fried, great flavor, and you can tell that it's actually real fish. The fries I got were great, just had a lot of basil. I honestly preferred the chorizo ones that Chris got. It wasn't spicy at all which was what I was worried about. I can't handle spicy foods at all so the fact that you can actually taste the jalapeno without it being spicy made it better to me. The shake was just amazing. If I was at the Linq and wanted a shake, I'd come here of all places!   For the two meals and one shake was about $42. That includes the upgraded fries as well. It's not too bad but not the cheapest thing ever. Also keep in mind that this place has all Pepsi products, it's okay though because you can just get beer if you don't like it! All bottled beers are about $5-6 so they're fairly prices. Especially for being at the strip! Amazing service, amazing food, great location, great price. All I know is, I can't wait to come back here soon!",

Establishment is fun- phone booth style doors for the entry, fun Union Jack themed fire hydrant out front. Staff were incredibly friendly.  Here's the \"bad\"- For how obviously popular this place is because of the name- there is little to no seating; maybe a dozen or so available \"spaces\" out front and maybe 18-25 MAX inside with elbows rubbing tightly.  The biggest disappointment however was the fish.  But first: THE CHICKEN IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously- I've never had chicken with such flavor and moisture- and it's not moisture you'd think of like \"dripping\" juicy-  it was like a natural tender moisture that was embedded in the meat-  uncanny flavor.  The batter as well was fabulous.  Crunchy, flaky but held together-  just phenomenal. The Orange Vanilla Lemonade and the Peach Ginger Lemonade as well were fantastic. The chips- I had the Parmesan Garlic truffle- very tasty. The standard chips were lacking slightly- a touch of salt would've made them great.  But they were properly cooked through, right color and texture.  Now-  the disappointment-  you go to a world renowned chef from the UK which is famous for Fish and Chips- you'd expect seriously good fish and chips....... While like the chicken, the batter was very tasty, I found the fish itself very VERY lacking.  It was lacking flavor, texture was off slightly, like somewhat dry...........but not \"dry\".   I don't know if I had built up my expectations higher than what they should've been- but I was left wanting.  I will go back however- simply for the CHICKEN and Lemonade!!!!!",

I got the dirty fries with truffle, Parm and chives and they were excellent. They let you try two sauces, I went with the tartar sauce which was great and then the curry mango which I will be dreaming about no doubt, it was absolutely amazing. The place is limited on seating but has a great atmosphere kind of what I envision of a chip shop in the UK. I also tried the fried sticky toffee pudding which was decadent and so good and then the chef kindly brought out a biscoff cookie shake which was also fantastic and super creamy. This is simple food done really well with good technique. A+ and a must visit.",

    "text": "***This review is for 11/14/17  Overall this restaurant was good, not amazing, not the best I've ever had, but definitely good food! Being on the strip in Las Vegas it is not cheap. When my husband and I went recently it was nearly $50 for two entrees, and two beers (both domestic).   Speaking of food, the menu is as expected consisting mostly of fries and fried entrees, which included: fish, shrimp, and chicken. I personally had the fish and it was cooked perfectly with a lovely, crispy breading. My husband had the chicken. The breading for the chicken was also very good, with herbs/seasoning mixed right into the batter. It was certainly tasty! However the chicken itself was only decent. Nothing too special. We both enjoy the plain, natural cut fries which were also very tasty. For each entree you also receive two dipping sauces. We tried the house tarter (which was good), the sriracha aioli (it was meh), and the southwest ranch (this was also good). I really enjoyed having a nice variety, but was disappointed that I only really liked the tarter sauce option.   Also for those of you that do not drink, they had one of those fancy soda machines that allows you to add flavor 'shots' to any drink of your choosing (they offered Pepsi products).   They also had dessert options, though we did not explore these. To wrap it, I would certainly eat here again if I was in the mood for good fish and chips. However, if that's not your cup of tea this really isn't the place for you.",

If it wasn't for the truffles, this would have tasted like nothing. Fish: Bland. The quality of the fish seemed decent. The batter was good. But why is it so bland? It really could have used salt and pepper. I don't think they used any at all. Coming from a restaurant with Gordon Ramsay's name on it, this is disappointing to say the least.

Ordered the Fish and Chips (Dirty #2), will see the amazing chef putting all the details in your order, looks really cool like his programs. Not that many places to seat but found a space and ate there.  Fish was very good and tender, felt fresh. The chips (fries) are cooked to perfection, the texture is impressive. Both items needed a dash of salt just to be perfect (weird because he's always complaining about that).  Price is good for the quality and the service and the line goes by very quick. Cool thing to do if you're near that shopping area and want to have a quick bite. One order is enough to share with two people if you're not super hungry.",

    "text": "Visit: Sunday, April 22, 2018  I came to Vegas this trip determine to have my Gordon Ramsay cherry popped. We didn't end up having time to a sit-down meal, and I didn't feel like burgers, so that left the Fish & Chips joint. It's a tiny place on the Linq Promenade, and it's definitely very popular. We had to wait for a while for a table to open up.   I ordered the fish and chips, with tartar sauce and sriracha aioli. This also comes with a drink, which makes it a pretty good deal. The food was fantastic. The fish was crispy and flaky, while the fries were perfectly seasoned and satisfying to eat. Nothing tasted overly greasy or heavy. The batter also did a good job of clinging onto the fish, and it didn't fall apart when I dunked it into the sauce.   The line moved quickly, and someone was cleaning tables pretty quickly, so it was fairly pleasant to eat here despite the crowded, cramped space. In all, this is probably the best fast food you can get around this part of the Strip, and I might come out of my way to eat here in the future. The fact a celebrity chef put his name on the business is nice, but the food speaks for itself.",

So tender it holds the sauce great and doesn't fall apart. The portion was perfect lots of fries. I can't wait to go back. They also have malt vinegar and lemon so all the traditional items to compliment the fish. With the chose of sauces and different fries the combinations are endless. Was a great experience.

The French fries were like any other French fries though.  The drinks are variable and there are many choices to choose from. The food was greasy after several bites. You can order three different types of fries as well. One with truffle and parmesan, an aoili sauce and one with jalapeno peppers.   You also get a choice of two different types of sauces that are quite interesting. I got the Gordon ramsay tartar and mango with curry although you can choose between four or five others. I just happened to choose my fave.  Overall the  experience was quite worth the wait. The seating outside is nice because you can people watch. But that is entirely up to tou to decide. This fish and chips is better than most other places that I have been too.   In conclusion, the quality of the food here is amazing and of course it is Gordon ramsay, so you are getting a great meal.",

However, the total turn off and the reason for the 3 stars, were the flies. OMG! There were so many flies. Also, not enough seating, but I expected that because it's located in the busy Linq Promenade. The flies though, ugh. People were swatting them. I don't know if you ever seen Gordon on Kitchen Nightmares yelling to people about flies, definitely something should be done here. Also, food is left on counters while it is being prepared and served, which is fine, but I wanted to make sure flies didn't land on our food! Not sure I would come back. Maybe go to another restaurant of his and eat the fish and chips there? We've been to Vegas many times, and this weekend was all about Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants, so to come to this one, first stop, and leave meh?",

This is actually one of the places I wanted to hit up on my 1 day road trip to Las Vegas. We walked here from the Bellagio which wasen't that bad.  Its sort of in an alley way between the Flamingo and Linq casinos.  Theres very minimal seating inside of about 18-20 seats on either tables or counter space and about another 8-10 seats outside. The cashier was nice and patient.  Explaining the different menu options and drink options.  We ended up ordering a shrimp and chips as well as a fish and chips.  Along with a side of \"dirty chips.\" Food came out quickly.  The fish and chips had 3 large pieces of fish ontop of a bed of fries.  The fish was piping hot.  Thick crunchy crust but the fish was glistening and moist.  Fries were good too.  We had the curry mango and tartar sauce for this serving and both sauces were excellent.  The shrimp and chips came with 5 large batter crusted shrimps on a bed of fries.  The shrimp were a bit oily still but were crunchy on the outside but tender on the inside.  And with that one we had the sriracha aioli and euro mayo. The dirty fries had truffle, parmesan, chives on some crunchy hot fluffy fries.  It was a big serving compared to the price.  It tasted great with the ketchup.  The flavors were all there. Their lemonades were so so.  A little too tart.  And for an extra dollar to include it in your combo rather than the normal soda, I don't believe it was worth it. This place is good.  Gordon Ramsey definitely knows how to make fish and chips.  My only issue is in regards to one of the other employee.  Walking up to the cashier there's a rope going down the middle.  With no one in front of us we stood on the inside of the rope closest to the counter rather than the other side closest to the wall.  She had the nerve to say in a very loud and short/rude way that we're suppose to stand on the side closest to the wall.   Hell how were we suppose to know that?!?!  Without a sign saying please form line on this side... you take a 50 50 chance.   She was the same one who called out the order number.  She called my number several times in short succession.  Getting louder and louder and more irritable each time.  Like calm down lady I'm getting there!!!  Sheesh!!! Besides that little blip this place is fantastic.  Would've been a 5 star rating if I didn't encounter her...",

    "text": "I was stoked to finally try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. Because I love fish and chips in general, I was really excited.m to give this place a try.    But oh man, this place was such a huge letdown. Beginning with the pros. All the food was very crispy and cooked right. Fries and sauces were delicious! Fish was fluffy and full, which was appreciated. What else...oh. I think that's it.    Now the bad part. To sum it up, I left with grease-filled stomach that made me sick for the rest of the day. Fish and batter were SUPER greasy and flavorless. Gordon always puts an emphasis on seasonings on his shows, yet I guess he forgot to train his own workers. WHERE IS THE SALT? Again, the food was soooo greasy and flavorless. I couldn't even finish because I felt sick after the first fish.    Without the sauces, I would've had to stop after the first bite.    Do not go here. Two stars because of good fries and sauces.",

    "text": "Exactly what I expected and got. Great fish and chips that were crispy and not oily. The fish was a big filet with a perfect amount of batter. The fries were on the thicker side but still crispy. I happen to prefer thin fries, but hey, as long as they're not soggy or cold. Life will go on. And of course the tartar sauce. Really good. Better than most actually. They do have other sauces like a Sriracha Aioli, Curry & mango, southwest ranch and Dijon mayonnaise. I just wanted the traditional tartar sauce to go with my fish and chips tho.  The restaurant is kinda small. Only a few tables inside with counters along the side and a counter out front to eat and people watch. The menu is pretty straight forward. \"Fish and Chips\" with a few other items like a fish sandwich and shrimp/lobster/chicken/sausage and chips. A couple desserts, beverages and a small selection of beers rounds out the menu.  The service was good. All the employees were having a good time and talking with customers. It wasn't too busy so I guess they were enjoying the \"downtime\".  Overall this place is worth a visit if you're in the area. They do fish and chips very well. I did kinda expect a little bit more since it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  If he was just going for a simple fish and chip spot. Mission accomplished!",

But, the fries are always awesome during the first five minutes then they get hard. ????  The pomegranate drink was amazing. The sauces are so delicious it is worth coming here. The chips are delicious and amazing for the first three minutes after that they SUCK!!!  The fries here are like the In N Out fries; you know what I mean?

It's perfectly fried with just the right amount of flakiness. The curry mango dip is my favourite - don't bother with the ranch it's just meh. We ordered the fish and chip meal with two extra pieces of fish - total was just under $28. We got the choice to pick 4 sauces because we ordered the extra 2 fish pieces. When I'm back in November I'm definitely getting the dirty fries!   Not much seating - I always get my husband to grab a seat while I wait in line.",

    "text": "A fast casual Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Vegas to get those perfect fish n chips at a considerably reasonable price.  As many of you may already know there is no option here to order ahead and skip the line. We were there on a July weekday at around 4 pm. We went inside and there was hardly any room to maneuver our kid stroller. The place is tiny and crowded with people forming the line. To top it off it was hot inside, mostly because people were going in and out thereby leaving the door open most of the time. Limited seating tables inside, which I imagine would be very uncomfortable to seat in such a chaotic ambience. As there was no room to even stand and wait, I got my toddler out and we waited outside while husband did the order. He waited in line for about 20 mins then another 10 mins approximately to get the order. My husband said waiting in line was interesting as he could see and learn about how they make the fish and chips.   As for the food, they dint fail to impress a bit. Fish was crisp outside and nice flaky and moist inside. I read a blog where the chef Marisela Gomez mentioned that they make sure the oil is clean. And sure it is for the fried fish is almost non or less greasy. I loved their fries too (Sorry, not sure what fries we got as I had to be outside and couldn't see the menu). Don't want to be mean but comparisons are human nature and I can't resist but have to give in. I have tried Bobby Flay's fries at Mesa Grill and they were awesome too. For my taste, texture wise fries here at Fish n Chips and at Mesa Grill are neck to neck. For me, Mesa Grill fries wins by an inch for the spice that they use. May not be the best fries but undoubtedly the best fish and chips combo!   If I'm ready to fight the wait time I'd definitely be back for the food. I'd really wish they introduce something in the future to order ahead and skip the line. Then I'd most definitely never give it a miss whenever I'm in Vegas! :)",

Located just off the strip on the Linq Promenade, the very unique storefront draws you in for what you hope will be a great fish and chips (or seafood and chips) meal.  Food wise, I was not disappointed! We ordered a regular fish and chips and a shrimp and chips and upgraded both the fries to the \"Dirty 1 and Dirty 2\". The combos come with 2 of their sauces, I particularly liked the curry sauce!  Now, while I feel this was a 5 star experience, there were definitely some negatives but they are uncontrollable by the restaurant.   Popularity - the restaurant is popular and tends to get quite busy. They did combat this by pumping the food out pretty quickly.  Size - the seating is limited due to the size of the restaurant. That being said they do maximize the space and have a little bit of outdoor seating.",

The choices are pretty basic but awesome and you can go many different ways with the selection. I went with the basic fish and chips and they were very satisfying.   Definitely recommend upgrading your fries (compared the normal the garlic fries and the garlic fries were worth the price) and also to go with at least 2 friends as there are six different types of sauce you can choose from and each meals gets 2; each sauce is good in their own way!  The place seems to be packed every time and tables are limited, but there are areas outside of the restaurant where you can post up. The workers at the restaurant were also very friendly and helpful, that is always a plus!!",

Unlike our favorite Gordon Ramsay restaurant - the Steakhouse - GR's Fish & Chip's caters more to the masses. A quick (depending on the line) and fantastic meal that's surprisingly affordable!  The battered fish is light and airy, with the breading flaky and buttery. The fish itself is pretty hefty, and with the fries (absolutely go with the truffle parmesan!), you are guaranteed to be full! As far as economics go, the upgrades to your meal - like the fries and drinks - are almost inconsequential. The up-charge for the fries was $2 to select one of the \"dirty\" options, and the drink was $1 more for their specialty (I highly recommend the blueberry pomegranate lemonade!)! That's a fantastic deal, no matter which way you look at it.  The venue itself is fast casual, and seating is limited!",

The line here is practically out the door, so be ready to wait a bit, but the staff is working as fast as they can and trust me it's worth the wait. The only bad thing I'd have to say about my visit here is that there is hardly any seating. We got lucky enough to snag a spot outside just as someone was getting up to leave so keep that in mind.  If you're in the mood for something sweet after your delicious fish and chips give the sticky toffee pudding shake a try.

You get your choice of 2 sauces, I would definitely recommend the Chipotle Aoili. I wish I had gotten 2 of those instead of the ranch. The fries were... just fries as I elected not to upgrade them to anything special. I also ordered the sticky toffee pudding shake and that was delicious despite the shake being almost half whipped cream.   The restaurant is definitely a little crazy as it's tiny and there isn't much seating. The wait is also pretty long, but it's kind of to be expected given the area and that the restaurant has \"Gordon Ramsay\" in the name. Overall I was pretty impressed and definitely think this is worth a stop!",

There isn't a lot of seating in there also and the seats they have are hard and uncomfortable. Overall I would say my experience was average.",

    "text": "So, I just checked out GRF&C and it was every bit the British delectation I would come to expect from the likes of the man himself. Unlike SOME places (*coughGRScough*), this short order pickup joint is worthy of the Gordon Ramsay name.  I sampled the lobster and shrimp combo, whilst the wife got the classic fish n' chips. And I can safely say that nothing disappointed, food wise. The fish wasn't too greasy, the shrimp were nice and plump, and the lobster...my Gawd! I thought angels were gonna come floating down from the heavens and start playing harps with each juicy morsel I chewed. Even the fries were perfect!  Only minor complaint I have is when you know you're gonna have a place this popular, you should probably consider revamping your drink station to better accommodate the overwhelming crowds. I mean, they have only one drink station. As in singular. Uno. Un. Yksi. mt. Ett. Ya dig?  This makes no sense to me and it creates a bottle neck effect at the front door. It also doesn't help that it's one of those touch screen selection type machines that not very many customers can even figure out or understand anyway. I think they're giving the average customer way too much credit.  Otherwise, this one's another must visit. Just keep in mind the seating is extremely limited. In light of these qualities, I'm giving Gordon Ramsay Fish n' Chips 4 buttery deep fried morsels of lobster perfection out of 5.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate lunch at this restaurant because he was a big fan... but we left under-whelmed by the hype. While some of the offerings were excellent (the sticky toffee shake really is amazing!), other offerings (like the oddly soft and soggy truffle fries) were surprisingly lackluster. I doubt we'll come back again, especially when you take the high price into account!  We ordered two combinations for lunch -- the normal fish and chips combination (with the truffle fries) and the lobster-and-shrimp-and-chips combination (again, with truffle fries). To accompany our meal, we also ordered the sticky toffee shake and lemonade. Altogether, we paid about $50, including tax and tip. I'll review each of the items below.  First, the fish part of the fish-and-chips was *excellent*! The fish was well-cooked, with a thin, crispy batter on the outside and delicious white flesh on the inside. I just wish the fries lived up to the fish -- they felt somewhat mushy and under-cooked, and I would have preferred them to be far crunchier. I've had better fries at places like Wendy's, sadly.  Second, the lobster-shrimp-and-chips combination was a disappointment. The shrimp was great but the chips were again overly soft and the lobster was a big ol' pile of meh. Although the combination came with two large fried lobster \"tails,\" once you start eating them, you'll find that over half of each piece is overly soggy breading. I ended up stripping most of the breading off, only to find an anemic strip of lobster left over. It's just not worth the high cost.  Third, the sticky toffee shake is delicious -- and bloody enormous! It comes with so many little additions sticking out of it (two pretzel sticks! a large piece of toffee you can't even fit in your mouth! marshmallows! a mountain of whipped cream!) that it's hard to eat. It's also thick as all hell so I needed some water to actually gulp it down. Really good but it's also a hell of a LOT. I suggest sharing it with someone else!  Fourth, the lemonade was surprisingly good -- incredibly tart but authentic. You also get free refills if you get a drink here so that was a nice bonus!  And last, I'd just like to make a quick note about the restaurant. Although the staff was very nice, the location itself is crowded as all hell (expect to wait up to 30+ minutes for food!), and it's *very* hard to get a seat during lunch-hour. Plus, the staff doesn't wipe down the tables very often so even when you get a seat, it won't be the cleanest one around. Also, there's no bathrooms so you'll need to duck into a nearby casino if you need one. Caveat emptor!  Overall, I'd give this restaurant about 3.5 stars. The fish, toffee shake, shrimp, and drinks were good... but the lobster and actual chips were bloody disappointing, especially for $50. Unless you're a fried fish fanatic, I don't think this place is really worth a visit.",

There were 4 of us.  3 ordered the fish and chips and one ordered the shrimp.  It took a long time to get our food (several people who came in after us got their food before we did) and when it did come the fish was cold and greasy and the fries were cold and limp.  The photos the restaurant provides show large pieces of fish, but ours weren't even half that size.  I got my fries \"dirty\" which meant they added truffle oil, herbs and parmesan.  Definitely not worth the upcharge.  The person who ordered the shrimp said theirs was hot and the fries were good, so maybe the fish orders sat under a heat lamp or something while they cooked the shrimp.  Regardless, we will NOT be coming back!",

    "text": "Okay, so upon entering Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips, I was a little turned off by the odor, which was kind of fishy and kind of chemically. It seemed like they were trying to cover up the fish smell with bleach. Yuck. Good quality fish shouldn't smell so bad. However, I stayed because I've heard great things about the fish.   There was not much seating, but once another group stood up, my party of 4 was able to slide into that table. Also, the restaurant looked very clean even considering how busy it was.  We ordered the fish and chips and shrimp and chips. The fries were pretty run of the mill, but both the fish and shrimp were outstanding. They had a wonderfully clean flavor. The shrimp were large. The sauces were all delicious, too. We had the shriracha aioli, tartar, cocktail, and southwestern ranch.  It was also a bit on the expensive side. I guess I'd pay the price to get that great fish and shrimp, but for frozen fries and a blah atmosphere, I'm not sure it was worth the price. If this place was larger and had more of a pub atmosphere it'd be more worth it for me. But I see what they're trying to do here, which is get people in and out quickly.   I debated between giving this place 3 and 4 stars. The fish and shrimp are definitely 5 star worthy, but all the rest drops my review down to a 3.",

The fish is so perfectly cooked to a golden brown crisp, but the actual meat is so fresh and soft. The breading is everything. It's sweet, almost like the outer part of a deep fried oreo... yeah. Beautiful. The truffle fries are a really nice pairing as well, I always upgrade. As for sauce, I personally just prefer tarter since the rest of the food is already really flavorful. I would give this place 5 stars but I always struggle to find seating, so I get nervous to come here for fear of not getting a table right away.",

They had various sauces to choose from--I got the tartar and the sriracha aioli (apparently the dijon mayo was the least popular). The truffle fries were alright, nothing extraordinary with truffle salt. There was a lot of batter on my fish, and not enough fish. It felt like it was triple deep fried and when I bit into it, it was kind of like the texture of an almost burnt mcd's french fry. It was great trying it, but I would not go there again especially for that price.",

They have limited seating inside so I recommend having someone in your group grab your spot while another waits in line to place your order. They also have seating outside. The staff member taking orders was so friendly and explained the menu to each customer. You receive a number with your order and they call it out once it's ready for pick up. Fountain drinks and condiments are self-serve. Besides fish and chips they also have shrimp and chips, chicken and chips, fishwiches, and lobster tail on the weekends. The white cod is flown in daily and incredibly fresh. You receive three large pieces with your order and your choice of 2 dipping sauces. I tried Gordon's tartar sauce and the curry mango and both were quite good. The fish itself isn't seasoned very much but the dipping sauces make up for that. For chips you can get plain with sea salt or one of their three \"dirty\" versions: chipotle, jalapeno and chorizo, truffle parmesan, and bacon cheddar. Like Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant the truffle parmesan chips here do not disappoint. The chip combos include a fountain drink which is reasonable and you can upgrade your chips to one of the dirty versions for $2 extra or a domestic or import beer for $4/$5 extra. My boyfriend tried the chicken and chips with the southwest ranch and srirachi aioli dipping sauces and the chipotle, jalapeno, chorizo chips and said that it was good. We will definitely be back!",

The pieces of fish were rather large and I was already super full after eating the first two. The portion is definitely shareable. I like that you can choose how you'd like your fries to be made and all the sauces complimented the fish/fries well. I must say, Gordon's tartar sauce was A plus.  Tip: GET ONE OF THE LEMONADES! So refreshing. They come in the peach & ginger or vanilla & orange (my favorite of the two).  The space itself was tiny so I do not recommend coming here with a large party. We were a party of two and we barely found seats after walking in circles. Get it to go instead. It comes in nice box which makes it very convenient.",

I ordered the fish and chips and got the tartar sauce and the mango curry sauce. Added some squeezed lemon and malt vinegar and it was perfection. I loved the mango curry sauce to dip my chips. I could have used a second cup of that sauce because there was a great portion of chips. My husband is not a fish fan but ordered the chicken and chips. It was the same batter but the chicken was definitely well seasoned or marinated underneath the batter. That came with southwest ranch which was a tasty sauce as well. Drinks were included in the combos and it was a delicious and refreshing meal. I was super tempted to go through and get another order because it was so good, but I was full. Now I'll just crave it until my next Vegas visit.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is a VERY SMALL Fast Food Restaurant with ONLY three inside tables and some counter with chairs. The menu is VERY LIMITED but there are a few offerings besides Fish & Chips.  We Both went with the Fish & Chips because that is what you get here.  We got three pieces of battered Cod. The batter was done very light and was very crispy. The Cod inside seemed very fresh and was moist and meaty. The Chips was very good too and were moist but not soggy. You can pick up malt vinegar but you also get two dipping sauces with your platter. Between us we tried 4 of the sauces they offer. My favorite dipping sauce was the Gordon Ramsay Tarter Sauce. At the time I thought it was the best tarter sauce I've ever tried... It had a great yummy creaminess to it with great flavors.  I also thought the Mango Curry Sauce was MIGHTY Delicious but too aggressive with the fish and enjoyed some of the chips with it. Sriracha Mayonaise was tasty. Dijon Mayonnaise just tasted like aioli or maybe that gave me the wrong sauce?  This is the least expensive variation of Fish & Chips that Gordon Ramsay offers. (14.99)  At Gordon Ramsay Pub the Fish & Chips are beer battered and are served with mushy pears (around $30.00)  At Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse The Fish & Chips are made with Loup de Mere and cost around $45.00)",

    "text": "Being from the Pacific Northwest, I absolutely love fish & chips and I really, really want to find a spot for it in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, I was not wow'd upon visiting. It's definitely a touristy spot, being located on the strip at the Linq's shopping center. Three of us visited on a Thursday night around dinner time. It looked busy; however, the line moves relatively fast and they have an efficient system for ordering. The menu is simple and composed of different variations of fried items and chips (fries). There's different spices and dipping sauces based on what types of flavors you personally like. I ordered regular fish & chips with fries in addition to the mango & curry sauce and southwest ranch. The fish was very bland. It had light breading but it was very plain. My favorite thing from the meal was the peach ginger lemonade. If you have a big group, I would highly recommend ordering to-go since it's a smaller restaurant and there aren't many seating options, especially when it gets busy. My friend loves it here and I wouldn't oppose go coming back in the future but it wouldn't be on my accord.",

    "text": "Located on the Linq Promenade, you'll want to set the expectation that this is mainly a takeout spot.  But who wants takeout this deep into the Strip?  It's not like you can park out front and walk in and out.  Unless you have somewhere close by to take it, it will be cold by the time you get there.  So that brings up the issue of eating on the spot.  Yes there are tables and counters inside and an outside patio.    Here is where it gets tricky.  Because this place is located in such a pedestrian packed area, there is almost always a line to the door of customers.  Even if it isn't a long line, you'll notice a ritual when you walk in the London phone booth looking front door.  As you walk in, there are tables right there in front of you and to the sides.  There is also a counter to the left with high bar stools.  For the most part all of these will be occupied.  The ritual comes into play where you will notice people hovering like honey bees to a flower over other people as they eat or more so when it seems like someone is close to finishing.  The hovering bees are people who have already ordered and may or may not have picked up their food yet.  They are waiting for a place to open up so they can stake their claim and sit.    The bees from different hives will eye each other and display slight signs of faux dominance over their potential flower while nonverbally communicating \"I claimed this spot first.\"  There's usually a polite exchange between the people leaving and the people claiming to say \"I'm finished you can have this spot\" and \"thanks, now pick up your camera and tourist stuff and get to step'n!\"  So, you were a good worker bee and now you have a place to call your own and enjoy your meal.  The fish & chips are nicely done.  The fish batter is light and crispy. Cod of course has none of that wild fishy taste so it's always a staple for this type of food.  The fries are tasty and they have seasoned fry choices if you like (but it will cost you).  They also have several options for dipping sauce if you like and this comes with the meal.   The fish portion sizes are on the small side and might not be a good value to some for the price you end up paying. Expect your plate with fountain drink to be in the $15-16 range.  They have some flavored lemonades if you want to pay extra. Don't want the fish, you can try the shrimp.   Overall the place is well done and would be a better experience in another less dense location.   About that bee: an industrious worker bee may visit 2,000 flowers per day.",

Located at the end of the LINQ Promenade, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is a small fast-casual joint with an open kitchen concept and just a few tables for seating.  My boyfriend and I split the fish and chips combo, which came with a choice of battered meat (fish, shrimp, chicken or sausage) as well as a chips with the option to upgrade to one of the flavored \"dirty\" options for $2 more. Of course, we went with the battered fish with the Dirty #2 fries (truffle, parmesan, chives) The combo also came with 2 different sauces for dipping and we decided to go with their classic tartar sauce and their curry mango sauce. The fish was battered perfectly, hot and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was a bit oily and heavy so the portion size of 3 pieces is actually great for splitting with another person. The fries were thick-cut but not too thick--perfectly crispy. Loved the truffle parmesan flavor!  While tartar sauce is pretty much a must-have when it comes to fish and chips, I highly recommend the curry mango sauce! It's incredibly refreshing from its creamy yogurt base as well as dynamic and flavorful from its delicious notes of fruity mango and slight heat from the curry.",

You get three pieces with a bunch of fries and a drink for approx $14 USD a box, from a price point it's a great deal but the fish lacked seasoning. You have the option to choose 3 different sauces, I was a little curious to find out how Gordon Ramsey's tartar sauce would Taste and I wasn't really impressed with the tartar since it was bland and I mean zero taste... the mango curried sauce was pretty good (probably because I make the exact same sauce at home) but it pairs better with chicken rather than fish. They need to come up with a better sauce selection for the fried fish, a blackened sauce would be nice or just a zestier tartar sauce could save the day... think outside the box! Make your sauces more interesting and alive.  4 stars for overall quality of ingredients used, the seating area, the store presentation, speed of service, cost and location on the vegas strip.",

    "text": "AMAZING. Gordon Ramsay has done it again.  As I am allergic to seafood, including fish, coming here sounds like a mistake. I can't  consume the fish, but I am okay with eating chicken that is fried in the same fryer as the fish. Because of this, I get the Chicken and Chips. The chicken is cooked to perfection, where it is able to stay moist on the inside and the outside has a loud crunch. The batter around the chicken is not too thick, not overpowering the chicken meat itself. I have tried their Curry & Mango, Southwest Ranch, and Gordon's Tartar sauces. The Curry & Mango, my personal favorite, has a light smokiness to it from the curry flavors; their is also a hint of sweetness in the sauce that is only noticeable when you really pay attention to the sauce. The Southwest Ranch has the flavors of your favorite ranch, but it is up-scaled with a kick of cayenne pepper, giving it a smokey and slightly spicy flavor. Gordon's Tartar sauce is a classic and the acidity from the lemon juice gives it a light flavor that has a good contrast with the chicken.   For the fries, I have tried the regular and the Truffle, Parmesan, Chives fries. They are both delicious in their respective manners. The fries are able to keep their crispiness even at the end of the meal when you have finished your chicken and fish and their are only a few fries left to eat. They go well with the sauces as well but are great on their own; no ketchup needed! For the TPC fries, the slight earthiness from the truffles is evident in each bit of fries. The sharp and nutty flavor of the parmesan flavors the the fries well and offsets the earthiness of the truffle flavor.   Once I even took some Chicken and Chips home (about a 30 minute car ride) and though the food was room temperature at this point, they were both still very crispy! I highly recommend everyone to try this place out if you are at The Linq. Even if you are full but you are with some friends, split a 3 piece box of Fish or Chicken and Chips and taste what real English Pub food should taste like.",

I waited an hour and all of the workers looked stressed and miserable. :( the menu is perfect, it's straight to the point and the upgrades are very inexpensive, especially for eating Gordon Ramsays food! They had no hand sanitizer (it was empty) and the video booth was broken because it didn't get sent to anyone's email :(  The seating is also very small, 3 tables and a bar area that seats 15 people.   I got the fish and chips of course with ranch and tartar. I also tried my friends shrimp and chips and the sausage and chips. The fish was SOOOOOO good but the breading was thin and it kept falling apart. The shrimp was a dream, pink beautiful, and perfect with perfect amount of breading. The sausage was terrible and I don't recommend it. The lemonade is also incredible. I tried the dirty fries and they were amazing but I preferred them plain (THEY ARE THAT GOOD OF FRIES) I will be back for sure! Hopefully they hire more employees, there were only 4.",

The chips are crispy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. The fish had the best batter and was perfectly seasoned! Even the tartar sauce rocked it!

The jalapenos and the chipotle sauce added nice heat to a generally simple dish.  Pairing the fish and chips with a New Castle beer definitely made this comfort food even more satisfying.",

I was pretty excited to find this fish and chips shop right on the Promenade outside the hotel. I don't really care about Gordon Ramsay at all, but I love fish and chips! My boyfriend and I split the combo (fish, chips + drink) which comes with your choice of \"dirty\" chips (three different combinations of spices/toppings) and two sauces. We got the naked chips and the southwest ranch and sriracha aioli for dipping.   The fish and chips were done quickly and we sat on the patio outside for some people-watching. There were three large pieces of fish and a generous amount of chips - both were cooked really well. The fish was a bit greasier than I would've liked, but the chips were perfect. Both were super crispy and delicious! It was definitely enough to share. Overall, not the best fish and chips I've ever had, but certainly a good option!",

Indeed, the fish was quite unique with a light, crispy and crunchy coating that most fried fish doesn't possess.  The fish was smooth and moist.  The fish was very good although not quite what I consider mind-blowing.  I thought the chips/fries were very average and didn't eat many.  I much preferred the traditional tartar sauce over the curry mango sauce.  The line was a little long but moved along okay.  Seating is very limited so hopefully you get lucky once your food arrives and someone gets up and leaves their seat.",

Once again, I thought it would be a gimmicky restaurant with sub par food - nope- it was good and worth the wait. Since I only tried one dish I couldn't give it 5 stars (but I'm sure if I had, it would have bumped it to 5 stars - ugh). Ok, so I got the fish n chips. It was delicious. Seriously, it was. I speak the truth (sadly). The batter was crispy and flavorful while the fish was clean, fresh, and delicious. I upgraded to the truffle Parmesan fries with chives - they were good too (damn it). We picked two sauces, Gordon's tartar sauce and a southwest aioli (I believe) - the tartar sauce was delicious (lemony and dill or something).   Pros: Good fish, fries, and tartar sauce (damn you, Gordon!) Cons: Limited seating, long wait, a bit pricey",

I had hopes Gordon would nail a dish like fish and chips.   I was wrong. So wrong. The fish was crispy and the cod was absolutely fresh. However a heavy hand of salt made my plate of food unpleasant.   To be fair only the fries were oversalted. To the extent each fry was laced with crystals of salt. Way too seasoned for my taste.   I did like the Tartar sauce as I could taste the fresh fennel and it paired well with the fish. The Sriracha Aioli lacked heat and was slightly sweet.   The let down to continues with the Peach and Ginger lemonade. It tasted neither of peach or ginger all my pallate could discern was lemon and sugar.   As I'm sitting here stairing at my oversalted fries I am so disappointed at spending nearly $18 on this meal.",

    "text": "I'm just gonna say this here that Gordan Ramsay might just be the most overrated celebrity chef there is.   Walked in here and was excited to have fish & chips. Their menu is pretty confusing as in that the first part of the menu shows their \"fries/chips\" for 5.99 or something and i was like wow pretty good price for their fish and chips but really it was their $5.99 fries. In the middle of the page, it shows their fish and chips or shrimp/sausage/fishwich/chicken. Their price varies from 13.99 to 15.99 depending on what protein you want.   I got the 14.99 fish and chips + extra $ for changing their regular chips to truffle fries/chips. Really none of it was worth it at all. The fish was way too oily and the fish itself lack a lot of seasoning. I suppose you are suppose to use their sauces but their sauces was pretty underwhelming as well. The Gordon's tartar sauce just taste like any other tartar sauce. The curry mango was okay...I'm not sure if it really match the fish and chips. I kinda end up using ketchup to dip my fish at some point or like I would switch upon the 3 and kinda prefer using the ketchup...  The truffle chips/fries wasn't anything great either. As I mentioned before, the fish was oily and if the fish was layered on top of it, the oil just kinda made the chips/fries soggy. No bueno. this is more of a personal thing but I much rather have the small fries/chips than their med size fries/chips.   At the end of the day, I just thought it was overpriced for how much they gave you but everything about it was just lackluster in terms of taste and quantity. I will not be back.",

This was no different. I came from a Seattle trip to Vegas and ate fish and chips by Pike Market Place. Gordon Ramsay had the better tasting fish and chips hands down. Everything was fried perfectly. The fish was fresher then a Seattle based meal, which is saying a lot. This is pricey as the meal and tip for me came out to around $19. But it was worth the money.

Thankfully that isn't what happened which makes me want to come back. For the price and what it offers it was a pretty cheap price for me considering it's Gordon Ramsay's.

We found it by accident really walking the Promenade of the Linq.  We weren't really planning on eating right then and there but since we saw it we tried it.  We loved it!  The menu is simple.  The place is small.  If you are lucky like us to find one of the table/chairs right in the front you have a good view of the Promenade to just watch people while you enjoy the most flakiest fish and most tastiest chips ever.  When first looking at the menu I thought it may be a little pricey at $14.99 but the combo included a drink and the chips and 2 sauces.  So then I thought...SWEET!  We shared one combo.  We ordered Dirty #2 which is the truffle parmesan fries.  Yum.  The fish was light and flaky...it was easier to just pick it up with your fingers because by the time you dip it, it's so flaky and soft it either ends up in stuck in the sauce or it breaks apart.  We loved it.  We would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Last time to GRFC was over a month ago. That meal of fish and chips had the fish with a very heavy thick batter. It turned into a Kevlar type of outer coating and took a lot of effort to break through. The fish was over cooked and not flaky as on all previous visits. Our current visit on 26 November same situation. Brought the fish back to the counter and were offered a replacement but no guarantee that it would be any better. In any case desire to have their product has disappeared. Was given card of the Caesars manager and have sent an email. This place needs to get back to their original wonderful fish and chips.",

    "text": "Great meal; great value. Ramsey's celebrity aside (or perhaps because of it?), I had a wonderful experience and I'd totally go back. I opted for the fish and chips 'box' which consisted of three ample sized pieces of cod (I think), perfectly crisped in batter. For referencing, each was about the size of a normal Mars bar + a boatload of fries and Gordon's tartar sauce (which contains dill, my preference and comes with more than enough - nice to see no skimping here for profit's sake). Along with a bottle of Guinness, tax, tip, out the door for less than $30, to me it represents pretty amazing quality and value mere steps off the strip. About the only thing I would have thought Ramsay would do differently is the fries - they were single fried rather than twice fried (blanched, rested to cool, then fried again for limp but golden crispy pub style).  Overall really really nice; service was fast and very friendly.",

There are about 20 different sauces to choose from and you get 2 with your order. We chose the tartar sauce and sirracha mayo - both were well made! And they so had ketchup for the \"chips\" that were crispy with just the right amount of salt. As for the fish - it was crispy, fresh, batter was spot on, and reminded us of the ones we ate when we were in London! All orders are cooked when you order so there is a few minutes wait which we did not mind. Seating is limited though as it is meant to be a carry-out place so don't let that deter you as it did for quite a few. Prices are a bit higher but for the quality - it  was worth it.",

    "text": "The fish here was deep fried very well, but the downside is that everything is very bland if you don't use the dipping sauces. In essence, your experience will be of eating something flavored like the dipping sauce that you chose, paired with the light crispiness of the crust and the soft delicate texture of the fish. Because the fish used was cod, there wasn't much flavor. The fish was very delicate and the crust was crispy and light at the same time. The flavors could have been brought out more by seasoning the fish before frying or even incorporating salt into the batter, but I think the way that it is done here is what is done traditionally in the U.K. We chose the sriracha aioli and the tartar sauce, and we definitely prefer the sriracha aioli. It had more flavor than the regular tartar sauce, but it wasn't as fiery as straight up sriracha. The accompanying chips were fine but nothing memorable.",

The tartar sauce was crazy good. Got the dirty fries with truffle oil parmesan and chives. Soooo delicious. Couldn't eat the bottom fries though as they were a little heavy handed with the truffle oil. Definitely something I'll get again but I will ask them to be a little more conservative on next time. The only thing I would truly change was having another fryer up and going. There was only one person in front of me and 2 people that had put in orders and were already waiting yet the food took 35 min. Being it's a walk in quicker food option I was hoping it would have moved faster. All in all a do again for sure.",

My suggestion for all you yelpers: Sit outside and eat. It more fun eating in the fresh air and people watching at the same time! (hehe). The order came with 3 big pieces of fish and chunky fries with sauces set up neatly in a cool looking take out box. So, the million dollar question is is it worth $16 and some change? The answer is YES! The breading of the fish was crispy and light. The chips were nicely seasoned and crispy also. The grease factor was on the low side. The sauces complimented the fish very well. Overall, its the best fish and chips I've tasted in Vegas. I wouldn't say I would eat here all the time because its fried food. A good cheat day resto...",

    "text": "If you were a visitor looking to tell everyone at home you went to a Gordon Ramsay eatery while in Vegas, this would be at the bottom of the four GR restaurants to visit or brag about.  At $16 for the fish and chips combo, which includes 2 dipping sauces and a small drink, I'd rather a \"Farm Burger\" from his Planet Hollywood location.  Throw in the cramped dining area, the condiment section being jammed into a stupidly small section by the soda machine, and eating at Crown & Anchor off the strip while throwing back a few pints from actual glass sounds like a way better plan.    The only highlight was fortunately the fish; three hot, delightfully crispy and lovingly breaded pieces with nice tender meat inside.  The fries were just fries, and I could have easily gone for a double serving of the sauces (tartar and curry mango) that were better portioned for a 4 piece Mcnugget meal.  I wanted all my fish covered in sauce and it was all but gone before the second piece was even finished.  And isn't it weird that the recipe for this same dish at his pub at Caesars Palace is totally different?  It's definitely better here and his pub should just replicate these ones.  As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the chips aren't authentically British, lacking thickness and shape, but who is really in the business of being \"authentic anything\" in a town where fake Paris, fake New York and fake Egypt are right down the street?    Remove the famous name off the sign and call it something like \"Fred's Fried Fish\" and this place probably wouldn't last a year on the Linq promenade.  That being said, it's not a bad spot for a quick bite in what is quickly turning into an alley for uppity junk food.",

    "text": "Staff pretended to be nice and helpful because they are working in \"GORDON RAMSAY\" restaurant, but in fact they didn't know anything. Fish was nice and crispy from outside juicy inside, but was still very oily to the point my hands were super oily and I had to use two tissue papers to clean it properly but I still won't mind that too too much as I know fish and chips are suppose to be a bit on the oily side. Chips on the other hand was a total disaster. I haven't had McDonald's in over 7-8 years because of the bad quality and overall bad rep of the food, but after eating these fries, I'd say McDonald's fried are far better. These chips were horrible, they were literally pipes of potato filled with nothing but oil. The first chip I picked up and broke it into two, there was no potato meat inside but just simple oil coming through. When I addressed the problem to the staff, they just simply handed me another box of same chips topped with may be a very few little better chips and after it was all the same. For the price I was paying for those fish and chips this was a complete disaster and a complete no no to recommend someone. Now I'm not sure it was just us or people do experience the same. I wouldn't recommend to go to a place just because the owner of the place is famous. When you are paying for your food, it gotta be decent enough to put it in your mouth not in garbage.",

The fries are perfect and the sauces are pretty tasty (I got the spicy aioli and tartar sauce) I ordered it without the drink and the meal came out to about $13.   Would definitely come back but bring my own water!",

The line does tend to get a bit lengthy but it moved quite quickly!  The service was friendly and helpful. With the amount of customers seen in any given day, they have their process handled with efficiency.    We had to get original Fish and Chips on mind to try.  The fish had a nice light breading and wonderful flavor.   You have several options as far as dipping sauces to accompany the seafood.  The fries (chips) had several options for toppings.  In the interest of science we wanted to see what they were like plain.  Well...  that was probably a mistake on our part.  They were very very plain and bland.  I wish they could've put some seasoning to say the least.  I would highly recommend upgrading to one of their topping options. It would have definitely saved the fries.  The highlight was their Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake.  Whaaaa?!!  This was a shake that all others will be measured.  Good shake consistency with amazing ingredients. Please don't leave here without getting a shake.  It is another good Gordon Ramsay place in my book.  I for sure will be back.",

Ketchup is free and self serve. My fiance and I split an order of fish n chips which was plenty of food for the both of us. The fish was light and perfectly crispy. The drink machine is one of those cool ones that you can customize (eg, add lemon flavor to your Coke). The fries are cooked well. Seating is limited, so we had to share a table with some strangers.",

We made this our first stop at 11 a.m. knowing that this restaurant gets busy. That was a good idea because we didn't wait long and easily found a spot to sit, but they were very busy when we finished eating.  We ordered Fish & Chips. I loved the fish and liked the breading on the outside. The chips were thick and for me a little bland. Next time I would definitely upgrade to one of the options with toppings. Each order comes with two dipping sauces. The sriracha dipping was really good and helped flavor the fries. The tartar sauce was tasty too. I liked that malt vinegar was available as well.   On our first trip in we were eyeing the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake so we ended the day with shakes. Yum! So much goodness in this thick shake. I opted for whipped cream and think it would have been better without to just enjoy the decadent shake alone.",

    "text": "Pros:  Fish: The Alaskan cod fillets was moist but the batter really made it a good battered fried fish. The batter is slightly seasoned and fried to nice a crisp and it does not overtake the fish. My boyfriend is from Australia and easily gave this place 4 star for taste and so far it's been his favorite spot for fish and chips in the US. But in his hometown of Brisbane, this place was an average 3 stars, so if you're from abroad with a plethora of fish and chips joints, then you're better off eating elsewhere.   Sauces: I was happy that they offered sauces other than tarter since I hate the taste of tarter sauce. I was pleased with the mango curry which has a little bit of heat from the curry spices.   Price: It's more a fast food type of restaurant with cheap pricing IMO considering everything else on the strip is pricey. I got the combo which comes with fries and a drink and upgraded my fries which is well worth an upgrade for extra flavorful fries and upgraded my soft drink to their house made lemonade which I would skip on.  Cons  Lemonade: I upgraded to their peach and ginger lemonade which basically tasted exactly like their lemonade from their soda fountain. They have an option to spike their lemonades with grey goose for double the price but you're better off getting a tastier cocktail elsewhere.",

There was no line when we arrived around 11:30 but keep in mind seating is quite limited with only a couple tables inside and a few stools to eat at a counter.   Ordering is walk up style and the menu is pretty simple. I chose the fish & chips with regular \"chips\" ( or fries for us Americans) and upgraded my drink to the sticky toffee pudding shake. They do have a couple different flavor options for the fries and you are given two sauces for the fish or chips. I had the tartar sauce and \"artisan\" ketchup. Not sure what was artisan about it, it tasted just like the Heinz they had.   The order was ready in about 5 minutes as everything is cooked to order. I was surprised I got 3 pieces of fish as I was only expecting 2. It was a decent amount of food for $15. The shake was a $5 up charge. I thought the fish was excellent, cooked crispy on the outside and very moist and flaky inside. The batter was very good in flavor as well.   The fries were also good, well cooked and crispy. As far as the shake, it was just too sweet for me. Yes, I know its a shake but it was super sweet and just too rich. I much prefer Gordon's actual sticky toffee pudding from Burgr which is outstanding.   It was a little pricey at $22 for lunch for you are center strip at a celebrity named restaurant so I was expecting it. I would definitely return when back at the Linq.",

    "text": "I never thought that I'd be taking a star off of a review for a soda machine, but nonetheless... here we are.  But let's start with the important stuff first: the food.  The fish & chips here are DELICIOUS.  The batter is perfectly light and crispy, and the fish isn't \"fishy\"... it's white and flaky and perfect.  Honestly some of the best fish I've ever had.  With a fish & chips combo, you get a tartar sauce and a choice of one other dipping sauce... which I really appreciate for the chips since I don't like ketchup.  I went with sriracha aioli and it was very good.    The chips/fries are... okay.  Honestly there wasn't anything wrong with them, they just weren't anything to write home about.  I actually wish the menu offered a \"just fish\" option if you weren't feeling like fries (I know, I'm talking crazy...), but it would be nice to have that flexibility.  Okay, the soda machine.  So, during my visit I had an interesting experience with this thing.  It was around 2pm on a Monday, so not the typical \"rush hour\" for food.  The line wasn't particularly long for food but I noticed a crazy long line for the soda machine.  I didn't think much of it at the time... until I ordered a drink.  I ordered a lemonade and was directed to the machine... no problem.  It was a Pepsi version of those Coke machines that allow you to mix-and-match, choose your own, etc.  I just wanted a regular lemonade, but as I'm about to press it the guy behind me says \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"  He explains that it seems to be out of \"soda\" and is just dispensing the syrup.  I pressed it and sure enough, he was right.  At his recommendation, I dispensed a little of the syrup in my cup and filled the rest with sparkling water and mixed.  Still WAY too syrupy and sweet.  Basically the line was full of people trying to fix their drink.    I realize this was probably a one-time experience, but even when it works properly I worry that this machine would still cause issues.  I completely understand that it seems like it would be easier this way... the people behind the counter don't have to worry about spending time getting us drinks, etc... and besides, people like these machines.  But see, this restaurant is small.  And there's just one of these machines.  While I was there, in between people who were \"fixing\" their drinks were people who had never experienced this machine before... and we're taking a lot of time.  Or kids who were struggling or having too much fun with it.  I just feel like these machines are great, but it adds SO much craziness in this small restaurant.   I'll be back for sure... the fish was perfect and the location is ideal... but I may reconsider my drink choices.",

Though every article announcing the opening emphasizes that this is a small grab-and-go style spot, it wasn't too tiny and I was able to snag seating at the outdoor bar area. The repurposed phone booth entrance is a fun touch, and service was friendly.   The fish and chips (3 piece, $12) was a large portion with two dipping sauces- the sriracha aioli was good but GR's Tartar sauce was great, wish I'd tried the curry mango sauce, too. Chips were saltier than I expected but the fish was in large, flaky pieces.   I got my guy the fish-wich, which was surprisingly served in a pita. This didn't really work, with breaded fish wrapped in thick dough, but I guess the flavors were okay if you're into carbs on carbs on carbs. The shishito pepper was unexpected and didn't really work, either. We took a few bites and tossed it.  Despite the restaurant name, there is also shrimp, chicken, and sausage available. I'll be back to try their version of Sticky Toffee Pudding, since the ones at Steak and BurGR were great!",

Was it the best I've ever had? Not quite. That title goes to a little place right on the coast of Oregon. But was it better than most? Definitely.

    "text": "I recently tried this place for the first time and it lived up to the hype. I ordered one of the most basic, standard items on the menu. I tried the fish and chips combo. It costs extra to add toppings to your fries. The unsung hero of the dish for me was the sauces. Each customer is allowed to choose 2 of 5 sauces for their meal. I went with Gordon's tartar sauce and the dijon mayonnaise. They were both very tasty. The fries taste crispy without being too greasy. The fried fish was the best fried fish that I've ever had in my life. It's pretty much the antithesis of the frozen fish fillets that one would find in the supermarket. Really light and fluffy and not greasy. Each bite melts in your mouth. I went early in the morning at 11am.  For some reason, there was a problem with the soda machine while I was there. While I waited for it to be fixed, an employee gave me a free 20 oz soda for the inconvenience. After about 10 minutes, they got the soda fountain working again. Some people have complained about the price, but I would argue that you get what you pay for. It's Las Vegas which means that a meal that costs between $17-$25 is pretty reasonable. I was full for the whole rest of the day so I feel that the price I paid (17 bucks) was fair. I've heard great things about the sticky toffee pudding shake that they sell here. So if you want to try it, you may have difficulty leaving \"room\" for it at the end of the meal. This type of food is filling and delicious. I will definitely check this place out during my next stay at the Linq. It's conveniently located on the Linq promenade.",

    "text": "Stopped in during their soft opening hoping to beat the rush but the word was out.  Wait was about 30 min to order then another 10 or so to get your food.  Not too bad.  Protein is hand dipped and everything is cooked to order.  We ordered fish and chips combo ($14.99) with sticky toffee pudding shake (+$5 w/combo) and an order of shrimp ($12.99 for 5pcs).  Fish and shrimp were battered perfectly, light and not greasy.  The fish was a little salty, probably from the chips.  Our shrimp that didn't come with chips weren't salty and had the same batter.  Sticky toffee pudding shake was rich and delicious.  If you like sticky toffee pudding you have to get it.  For sauces we chose Gordon's Tartar Sauce, European Style Mayonnaise, Curry & Mango and Sriracha Aioli.  I loved the sauces.  They also have a southwest ranch and artisanal ketchup I didn't try.    Seating is very limited.  This is a takeaway spot so if it is busy and you don't want to walk and eat (their packaging is designed for this) just ask and they will bag it up for you.    They have a Pepsi Spire machine (like Coke Freestyle).  Haven't seen many of those.  Other drinks are Peach Ginger Lemonade, Orange Vanilla Lemonade and also a Biscoff Shake.",

    "text": "Best fish and chips! We tried it once and decided to make this a \"Vegas must eat\" for us. Their menu is pretty small, but it's just the fish and chips you'll probabably want anyway. You get 3 pieces of fish with the combo and they're pretty decently sized.  They're fried fresh and perfectly so it's nice and crispy.You get 2 sauces with your order and I highly recommend the curry mango sauce! Neither flavor is overly strong and pairs with the fish well.   The combo comes with plain fries and a drink. You can upgrade the fries for up $2 with 3 different flavors/seasoning.  I like the parmesan, truffle, & chives best.  The meals also come with a drink, but you can upgrade to their lemonade (peach & ginger or orange & vanilla) which are both pretty good.   There's a small seating area indoors and out, so it might be difficult to find a place to sit and eat, esp if you have a large group.  But it hasn't been an issue for us, we usually find seats as people are leaving.",

Centrally located in the LINQ Promenade shops right between the LINQ Hotel and the Flamingo Hotel makes it easy to get to. There was a small line of about a dozen or so people ahead of us when we went on a Friday afternoon about 1:30pm for lunch, total time from when we entered to when we were handed our food was about 10 minutes. The food was great, I ordered the fish and chips with the Dirty #2 fries and it was amazing. They have a few other things on the menu, chicken, a fish sandwich and chowder but I went the traditional fish and chips route. The breading is perfect, nice balance of breading to fish. I also went with the tartar and southwest ranch dipping sauce, both were great, and you can't forget about the malt vinegar!  There are a few dining tables inside and a few walk-up stand-up bars outside in front of the place you can eat at. I am looking forward to my next visit.",

There was one day that they only just tried the business for like a few hours and lucky me I walked pass by so then I went in and ordered 3 pieces of fish and chips. The place was very trendy, and the service was pretty good too. I have never had fish and chips before but I know that this restaurant is based in UK, which should be pretty authentic and delicious. However, the outcome was not expected, the fish was only the a bit of it and most of it was the flour and the fries, seriously I think I could have better fries than this. Overall, I wouldn't come here again, because I'm not a really big fan of fried fish. Probably I expected too much from this restaurant since its from Gordon Ramsay.",

We probably got here about half an hour after it opened and it was already super packed! There aren't really that many seats in the area but we were able to find seats by the time we got our food. I suggest if you want to sit down and you're here with another person have one person order while the other wait for a seat to open and grab it as quickly as you can. Our fish and chips only came with about 3 pieces of fried fish but they were a good size and alot of fries. We got the tartar sauce, sriracha mayo and Dijon mayo. By far my favorite sauce from the 2 was the tartar sauce. Overall it was all really good the only problems was seating and i wish we got atleast 4 pieces of fish instead of only 3. Also make sure to ask for extra lemons",

The sauce that drew my attention was the curry & mango. I thought it was a very interesting combination so I got this one along with the original tartar sauce. Since there were no one waiting, our food were ready in an instant. The lady who handed us our food offered to put them in a bag. She said it was dangerous to walk outside with the food out as she had seen people just run by and steal the food. I thought it was really nice of her to do that.   The 3 pieces of fish were on the smaller side as compared to the ones I had in other restaurants. I personally thought they were too burnt. The actual meat of the fish was better. It was juicy and flaky but there wasn't much flavour. I had to rely on the sauce to add flavour overall. The mango & curry sauce was very tasty though, both elements were present and they worked well together. The tartar sauce was standard, nothing too spectacular I thought. Maybe I should have gone with the sirarcha aioli. Oh well.",

    "text": "This was actually really good! I got the fish and chips combo and upgraded the chips and the drink. The $2 chip upgrade to the truffle, parmasan, and chives flavor was definitely worth it. Same with upgrading my drink to the toffee milkshake for $5 extra.   The fish was flaky and freshly fried. The chips had a great flavor and were crispy on the outside. And the milkshake was a nice medium thickness with great flavor. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  Overall, a solid choice if you're hungry on the strip!",

    "text": "Been here on two different occasions, once with family and once with friends. It was St. Patrick's Day when I came with family, so there was a huge line, but it still moved very fast and we were able to get our food quickly. There are a good number of tables and chairs inside and outside the establishment, but like I said, it was a holiday so everyone was packed in.  Second time with friends, it was much quieter during spring break, and like before it was very fast service through and through.  Both times I got the fish and chips combo, and got the fries with truffle, Parmesan, and chives (dirty #2). All of their sauces are delicious, but my personal favorites were the tartar and curry & mango! The fish are very crunchy with the outside batter, but still soft on the inside. Not dry at all, which was fantastic. Their fries are also pretty amazing (especially if you get the toppings on it). I'll probably come again if I'm in the area and I'm looking for something quick!",

I wanted some fish and shrimp that had great reviews, wasn't too expensive, and was nearby. .  I had no idea Gordon Ramsey had a fish joint!  It's a really quaint English style restaurant.  Not a lot of seating indoors, but it's still worth it.  I had the \"G Spot\" - fish, chicken, shrimp & chips.  Fantastic!  Fantastic!  Fantastic!  The fish was fried to sweet perfection.  The shrimps were delicate on the inside and fried to perfection on the outside. The chicken was also SO tender and juicy!  Skinny fries had the perfect combo of salt & garlic powder.  Just simply amazing!  I can't get that PHENOMENAL, tender fish out of my mind!  The batter/ crust was out of this world!",

    "text": "This is one of five restaurants on the Vegas Strip with Gordon Ramsay's name on it.  It's located at the LINQ Promenade, the area with various shops and restaurants that lead to the giant ferris wheel (aka High Roller).  It's a casual eatery with a pretty simple menu, although it's not just Fish & Chips. You can get chips with sausage, shrimp, chicken, or Fishwich (fish sandwich).  There's a small selection of desserts, decent selection of beer, and some wine & liquor.    You can order just chips (without fish), but didn't see an option to just get fish by itself, which I thought was kind of odd.  Standard chips just come with sea salt, but you can order them \"Dirty\" for $2 more.  Dirty #1 comes with chipotle, jalapeno, and crisp chorizo; Dirty #2 comes with truffle, parmesan, and chives; and Dirty #3 comes with bacon and cheddar.    Combo items come with your choice of two dipping sauces and a fountain drink.  You can upgrade the drink to a beer for $4 or $5 for import beer.  Dipping sauce choices include Curry & Mango, Gordon's Tartar Sauce, Sriracha Aioli, Southwest Ranch, and Dijon Mayonnaise.  My wife and I both thought the fish was excellent, but found the chips to be mediocre.  The fish was crispy on the outside, and very tender and flaky on the inside.  It had no fishy smell or taste.  The chips didn't taste stale but the texture was.  I don't know if that's the classic British style, but it wasn't crisp nor soft.  It was just hard and chewy on the outside.  Perhaps it was overcooked.  My wife wrote her review and said pretty much the same thing.   She asked for a replacement but the server was stingy with the fries, and initially didn't want to replace them.  He eventually did, but the replacement chips weren't any better.   For dipping sauces we went with Curry & Mango and Gordon Ramsay's Tartar Sauce.  Curry & Mango sauce was good without being too sweet.  The tartar sauce was different than other ones I had in the past.  It was more creamy than sour/tart.  I noticed something similar with the malt vinegar too.  It had a rather subdued flavor and was less acidic than other malt vinegar.  In addition to the fountain drink that came with our meal, we also ordered Peach & Ginger Lemonade spiked with Grey Goose Vodka, which was pretty good.  I would've preferred it with a stronger ginger flavor, but it seems like most of the items here have more of a balanced flavor.    If I come back here next time, I will ask if there's an option to get fish without chips.  As I mentioned previously, I didn't see that option on the menu, but maybe it's something I have to ask for.",

The country that I am originally from, we are like to think we fish and chips experts . The restaurant is cute and I loved the vibe. The staff were very helpful and friendly.  I had the toffee pudding pops which were good but the sauce was a little on the sweet side. We ordered fish and chips along with sausage and chips. The sausage which I thought was going to be a banger  was actually a chorizo like rolled up sausage. Seasoning was a little low . The fish which was fried nicely and flakey but was not seasoned enough either . It was also a little on the greasy side. The curry sauce was ok and Being Indian I definitely did not taste any curry . I was a little disappointed to be honest.  I am happy we had the chance to try the place but we will not return.",

My only disappointment is that the bed of fries was the majority of the meal. If they added perhaps one more piece of fish, I would've been satisfied.  Overall, I had a decent experience. I would definitely return when I crave for some fish and chips.",

When you arrive, you'll see two small red doors (in case you miss it, look for the British color fire hydrant).  Don't expect this to be a Michelin star joint; in fact the dining room can use some maintenance and improvement. The table was wobbly and the trash can was over flowing (the plastic forks and knives are on top of the trash area towards the back. The restaurant wasn't that busy.  In terms of the food, hands down it's good. The Cod was nice, juicy and flaky while the batter was light and not too oily. In fact, it's the best I've had. For their meal you do get drink and lots of fries but what's not on the menu is that you can order a la carte.  Their Shrimp meal ($15.99) consist of about five large shrimp (deveined) marinated and with some herbs, fries, a soft drink and your choice of two sauces. Very flavorful and a must try if you're a shrimp lover. Three piece of fish cost $8.99 which is not bad. The fries were a surprise, but reminded me of those from Wing Stop. The sauces were flavorful, but was more on the oily side.  There's minimal inside seating and a few outside but the turnover is pretty quick.   If Fish-N-Chips is your thing it's worth a try but I wouldn't go out of my way just because Gordon Ramsay's name is on the wall.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is a fast-casual place on the LINQ Promenade that serves some distant version of the famous British classic dish. It's one of the newer dining options having just opened last fall.  I was looking for a non super-sized lunch option in Vegas last weekend. It was a toss-up between this and Jaburritos right across the way, but we went with this since I have poke-style food quite a lot and I hardly ever have fish and chips.  I got the fish combo which consisted of cod fish pieces, chips (fries), and a soft drink. The fish was excellent; super flakey, not very greasy, and it had good flavor. The chips meanwhile were good but were definitely not real British-style chips. I would classify these more like steak fries since the peels are still left on them, and chips that I've had in London are thicker.  You get a choice of two dipping sauces with your combo and I went with Gordon Ramsay's Tartar Sauce (basically regular tartar sauce) and Sriracha Aioli. I really liked the latter since it had a smokey flavor and really enhanced the flavor of the food.  The storefront is really cute with a British phone booth motif for the doors. However the place is really small so good luck finding a place to sit inside or on the tiny outdoor patio.  While the food was not supersized the price still was unfortunately: it was just over $16 for my combo.",

This is located on the Vegas strip right next to the LINQ hotel and across the street from Caesars Palace.  The place is cute and has very limited indoor and outdoor seating.  I got the fishwich and chips combo that also included the drink.  There were other side options.  You also get to pick 2 sauces.  I chose the sriracha aioli & the southwest ranch and both were yummy!  The fishwich was so good and flavorful.  They give you so many chips I couldn't finish it all lol  They have a machine to choose you drink of choice.  They have a line but it moves fast.  I will def come back here when I return back to Vegas!  It was that good!",

So for fish 5/5, fries 3/5, and sauces southwest ranch 4/5, and siracha aoli 5/5.   Took two stars off because there really needs a better system in there with ordering and pick-up, filling soft drinks, and the very limited seating. That made it not the best experience at all. It's like packed sardines. Awful!!!   Would come again for fish only at an off meal time!",

So don't expect a varied menu. That said, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, these are good. They are served fresh and piping hot, and the portion is very reasonable/filling. You can choose 2 sauces, and they have standard ketchup available as well. We all enjoyed the tartar sauce and the sriracha aioli, and the Southwest ranch was good with the fries.",

Lovely and very English decorations, that remind you of Dr. Who.   Fast, fresh, amazingness!  Fish and Truffle Fries: 5/5 Out of this world amazing. I've never been a fan of fish and chips, mostly never a fan of fish. But leave it to Gordon Ramsay to make me fall in love with this dish. With the combo you get a drink, 2 pieces of fish, and fries. You can upgrade the fries, there are different kinds to try. The breading on the fish was amazing, crunchy and the inside really tender. Perfection. The truffle fries were of course a perfect compliment. I tried the house tar tar, and the spicy siracha sauce, both were great. I'll try some of the other sauces next time.   It's about $16 per combo. The portion is good enough, it's a good snack to share with another person.",

We got sticky toffee pudding shake, peach and ginger lemonade, fish and chip, and a side of shrimp. Fish and shrimp were fried perfectly and I enjoy the batter. I like my fries on the crispy side and they were not all that crispy. The shake was great but a tad sweet and the lemonade was refreshing with a punch.  Overall, the price at a tourist location and the quality was worth the 30 minute wait. However, the layout of the floor plan and staff could use a bit more work because it wasn't that busy but the line was moving slowly.",

There were only a few options, but that means they can focus on preparing and making their best food.  It turns out to be True. The combo was a bit pricey, I think, especially for just fish and chips.  Those turn out to be really good.  The fried fish was hot and fresh.  The fries were one of the best I have had - favorable.  One can add money to get their special sauce, but I got the standard sauce, and it is just as good. They do not have a lot of tables and chairs, which is a minus.  There weren't a lot of people when I got there, and I had to wait a while for a table.  When I left, there was a long line for ordering food, and people had nowhere to sit down.  This is a minus. When we were there, there were a crew of photographers outside taking pictures of the food.  That is fine except they occupied one of the already few tables at the restaurant.  They should have been more considerate of other customers. All in all, it is a good experience.  It is a bit overpriced I think for just fish and chips, and the quality of food makes up for it.  The restaurant should be able to use some more tables and chairs for its customers.",

It's located at the LINQ shopping area. It will be hard to miss it because of the nice ambiance in and out of the restaurant.   Went here with 5 more people just us excited to try this place but not highly recommended for big groups because they have less than 20 chairs inside the restaurant. Yes, this place is tiny. There were about 6 chairs outside to eat but this place is new and crowded.  Menu is small and kinda confusing at first but Alex was kind and friendly enough to help us and he explained it well to us. Service here was so fast.   So far this place is: small, could get crowded, confusing menu but not only just service that was great also THE FOOD!!!!   I ordered the shrimp and chips combo which includes a drink. It came with 5 jumpo huge deep fried delicious juicy shrimps, \"too thick for me\" well-seasoned fries, 2 great sauces of you choice: the tartar sauce was good, mayo was alright but i tried someone's mango curry sauce and it was to die for, and for my drink i got peach and ginger lemonade which was so refreshing, the other was vanilla orange lemonade which i tried a small taste.. also good but i could only pick one.  I tried their fish also and it was WOW! battered and deep fried perfectly, great taste, fish was fresh and melts in the mouth.  this place is best for quick bites and to go to take to your hotel if the restaurant is already packed.   I don't really have a go to place for fish and chips here in Vegas so yeah, got one now!",

The line was wicked long, but moved with speed as workers pushed out food very fast.  Seating is limited and can be problematic, but once the new shine starts to wear off this place is going to be a great option.   I ordered a fish meal, which included three pieces of fish, fries and drink for 14.99.  Not cheap, but I felt for the location quality and the quantity it wasn't priced bad.  The fish was really good and we actually spilt the meal between the two of us. We found it was more then enough food.    No doubt I'll be back and I think this place will be a hot spot.",

The fact that you can choose two different sauces is a plus as well because I prefer variation! The food was mediocre at best though; the fish had way too much batter and the fries were over cooked.

The batter is perfect, as is the flaky fish inside. The chips are also perfectly cooked and the sauces are remarkable. I was not expecting it, but as I was eating each bite, I thought to myself that this was one of the best meals of any sort that I had experienced. I know, it's a fish and chips place and fast casual at that, but this is how I felt at the time. I realize that our culinary experiences are subjective.",

This place is very clean and while the menu is limited, you will not be disappointed!  The staff is super friendly and, for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, it is surprisingly affordable.  A basket of fish and chips plus a drink is $14.99.  The portions of fish and chips are generous and there are free refills on the drinks.  It is kind of a self-service, casual place; no waitstaff.    This place was so good that we had to make one more visit there before leaving town.  We are going back to Vegas in a few months and will definitely be eating here again at least once!",

    "text": "I am a very huge Gordon Ramsay fan (mentally and physically if you know what I mean). This is the second Gordon Ramsay Restaurant I have been to - the other being the Gordon Ramsay Burger. Anyways, today me and my family decided to go there to get a quick late night appetite fix. Everything about my experience is what I expected, reason being that this is an establishment of a world-famous celebrity chef. The star of the show, the fish and chips, were very filling, a trait that all Gordon Ramsay meals have. I can tell the beer batter was of very high quality because I could taste the bitterness of the beer while experiencing that light crunch. The cod was very juicy but the juices were still retained by the beer batter. The chips that came along (I chose the truffle, parmesan, and chives), were tossed in a very generous coating of the seasoning. So now, you may be wondering why I gave this place a 4- star. I really don't think the service was up to par. The cashier was friendly but the place could have been a little more well-maintained and the people who calls for the orders to be picked up should call in a friendlier manner. It is not known to me if this is part of the experience, but I wasn't the biggest fan of that I'd the case. However, this didn't subtract from the amazing experience I have and I will definitely be stopping by everytime I come to Las Vegas. The food is an obvious 5/5 and the service is a 3/5. I give a well deserved 4-star rating.",

Which was the case when I went this past weekend. I had to eat on a ledge outside another store by the big Flamingo. The food was a bit pricy as I got the fish and chips combo but was well worth it as the fish was really good, fries well done, the tartar sauce was quality and the drink selection was good. You have the option to choose your sauces and can also upgrade your combo to include a milkshake or beer rather than a soda. That's a nice option. All in all good and lives up to the Gordon Ramsay name.",

Outside there is two small counters and one small table. I was waiting near a table for it to open up and when I saw the people starting to clean up, I asked them if they were leaving and if I could have the table, and they were polite, smiled and said of course. As soon as they step away, before I could sit, this old lady comes swooping in and says I was waiting on the table. Whatever old bat. Take the table. I was able to snag the table next to it anyways as that couple was leaving as well.   The fish was good, but adding the lemon on it made it better. The fries were salted and delicious. The tartar sauce was the best I ever had.  Would I return? Maybe. Would I push the old lady out of the way next time? Definitely.",

It was a simple crispy on the outside, soft on the inside fish and just squirt some lemon on there, BOOM tastes amazing.

It is a tad pricey and it's not on the menu but if you're not super hungry ask for a small basket with two fish. I believe it was $11 but I could be mistaken.   They have several dipping sauces to choose from but I chose the original tartar sauce and tried the Sriracha one to mix it up. Both delicious and went well with the fish and chips.  Order comes out pretty quick. Fish is fresh, light, crispy, flakey and not greasy at all. The only thing that sucks is that the seating is very limited.

I love fish and chips being that my mum is from England, I've been eating them my whole life. I thought surely a Brit won't fuck them up (as often happens here in America), they should be good! To my horror and dismay the food was a gross, disgusting, greasy mess! No flavor and my husband picked off all of the thick greasy batter on his fish. We were so disappointed!

The fish was bland and was in a warmer already cooked prior to us ordering and the three pieces were cooked differently one was more burnt then the others. They had a bland taste with no seasoning to them. The chips/fries were even worse, they were cold and some were dark brown and very very greasy and had no salt on them at all. I was excited to try this place as Gordon's other restaurants in town are great every time I go. This was a big disappointment, even as I'm sitting here leaving the review the employees are just joking around and seem to not care about the quality of the food they are putting out.",

Unfortunately one of my friends and myself both ordered the same dish, the sausage combo and shrimp and we both got food poisoning from it. Our other friend who ordered the chicken combo was completely fine. Also one of the people working there told us the sausages may look pink inside but that's just from the paprika seasoning, not from being undercooked. But now I feel like he was just covering because they probably were undercooked which is why my friend and I both got sick from it. I'm more annoyed at the service of the restaurant for trying to cover it up  before we even left the restaurant and when we tried to call them the following two days to let them know they are serving undercooked sausages, they failed to answer their phone everytime. Very unprofessional and they ruined the rest of our night.",

You can tell it's a good piece of fish.  Very juicy, perfect texture.  Best quality fish inside batter I've had.  Gordon's tartar sauce was also delish.  The okay: had the dirty #2 truffle chips.  It was okay.  A bit tough.  Fries were a lot better at Ramsay's Burgr.    The bad part: Fish was way under-seasoned if at all seasoned.  If it weren't for the quality of the fish, I'd have been very mad.  The Curry & Mango sauce just didn't work on its own or with the food for me.  Maybe I went on an off day?  Still a strong no to the Curry Mango tough.",

Also they have Peach and Ginger Lemonade which I loved so much! It goes so well with fish and chips! They have many varieties of beers as well of course, but I am not a beer drinker unfortunately.

After I had placed my order, this girl in a chef's uniform comes in and loudly proclaims that she has an ASAP order for Mr. Ramsay. After a few minutes of waiting for my food, I can see my order is ready but there's no one to hand it to me since everyone is busy working on Mr. Ramsay's order. When someone finally sees that my order is up, they hand it to me. I made the statement, \"I'm really happy you are working on Mr. Ramsay's food while mine gets cold.\" She just replies, \"Well sir, it is Mr. Ramsay's order.\" Okay, here are my questions about what just happened... WHAT KIND OF F@#KING IDIOT DO YOU THINK I AM?!  This guy owns 35 restaurants and it happens that he picks this one. Sure, it's possible that Gordon was really in Las Vegas while I was in his restaurant. But if he really wanted fish and chips, wouldn't he just phone is order in? Would he really send someone to wait in line with the common folk if he is so F@#KING important? Does he really want someone to announce his order to everyone in one of his restaurants and have it take priority over his paying customers? Wouldn't a professional in the industry do this all a little more discretely?  I have my own theories on what when down that night. I believe that the order was for someone at his restaurant across the street or that b@#ch just scammed everyone for some free food.  If it was really for you Mr. Ramsay, you can eat a bag of D@#KS!  Your fish and chips were excellent, but the place was a little dirty. But hey, it's Las Vegas.",

The chips were also just ok... regular and normal.  4. The soda Machine is screwed up... we thought everything tasted funny, so did the two people behind us, so it wasn't just our taste there is something wrong with that soda machine. 5.

I get it's Gordon Ramsay and you are paying for the name, but if you're incredibly hungry there is a chance you would leave hungry. The fish and chips meal comes with 3 smallish pieces of golden fried fish with a small amount of fries. The different types of sauces are incredible, I stuck with the traditional tarter sauce and it was fantastic. The other reviews are True that seats are a hot commodity. Would definitely come again.",

    "text": "The good: the fish & such is battered & fried before your eyes. The fish basically comes fresh out of the fryer and into your hands.   The bad: the chips have been on the line for awhile so they're not as hot and fresh as the fish. Seating is at an absolute premium. If the idea is you're supposed to walk around the Promenade eating your food, that's not well thought out, because you've got a box of fish in one hand and a drink in the other. If the weather is crappy, there are tables inside the Flamingo where the coffee shop used to be.   They have fish & chips, shrimp & chips, chicken & chips, and sausage & chips. You can't necessarily mix your proteins, but there is a \"secret combo\" of fish, shrimp, chicken & chips. It's a good mix. Less successful are the \"dirty chips\" where cayenne & chorizo are mixed with the fries. Maybe if they weren't lukewarm before being tossed they'd be better.   The combo wasn't bad, but since it's Vegas and it has Ramsay's name on the box, a secret combo and a beer will set you back about $24. I'd like what I got better for about $10 less.",

    "text": "I love fish and chips.  As such, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips was conceptually exactly my kind of place.  Located on the Linq Promenade, it was easy to find and doing a brisk lunch business on a Monday afternoon.  Surprisingly, there was little seating both inside and out for diners, which was a bit problematic given how GR F&C serves its fish and chips.  It definitely wasn't hand food like a sandwich or burrito.  The quality of the cod was very good.  It was nicely fried and perfectly crisp on the outside, moist, glistening and flaky on the inside.  For the price ($14.99), though, I would've liked a little bit more fish and a little bit less chips.  Falling prey to the upsell for the chips, I added cacciatore spice and fresh basil to my order, which added a dollar to its price, but added little to the chips except make them messier to eat.  The choice of two condiments that come standard with the fish and chips (I had the curry & mango and Sriracha aioli) were very tasty sauces in and of themselves making the upsell even more unnecessary for the chips.  Given my love for Gordan Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream dessert at GR Steak, I had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake milkshake ($8.99).  Sadly, it, too, was a disappointment.  While brown butter ice cream may have been used in the shake, it tasted like plain vanilla lacking any discernible brown butter notes.  The sticky toffee pudding element of the shake was a very thick sauce possessing a granular sugar quality, which was squeezed into the shake, but never came close to melding its flavors into the shake mixture, which was overly thick by itself, making it a difficult proposition to suck through a straw.  While the milkshake certainly didn't taste bad, it didn't come close to living up to or even approximating Gordon Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding in milkshake form.  Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips was the lone disappointing meal of my trip.  While nothing was bad, nothing was exemplary either.  It seemed a bit overpriced for what I got and it under delivered on what seemed like achievable objectives.  It will hold appeal for Gordon Ramsay fans, but for this fan of Gordon Ramsay and his food, I came, I saw, but I don't see a need to return.",

She is long gone but I can safely say Gordon Ramsey has done it again!!!! I have a Mancrush on this Guy!!!  If your here I highly recommend the fish and chips or anything with the Fish. I ordered the Fish and Chip Combo.   You have your choices of 3 dirty seasonings for the fries. I got Dirty #1 chipotle, jalapeno, crisp chorizo...The fish portions are incredible and served Superhot!!! Fish comes with sauces as well. I got the srirachi aioli. Delish. Fish Right out of the deep fry. The batter is clean and so frickin crisp. That amazing crunch sound while devouring the fish.... AMAZING. DEAFENING!!!!! I recommend ordering a Peach Ginger Lemonade to wash it down.  That stuff could be bottled and sold for $$ So refreshing.  My companion got the Fishwich . Looked good and he enjoyed it tremendously.  Wait time can be a bit long depending on time of day. We waited 20 minutes which I found to be well worth it. Food reasonably priced. Very small space and limited seating.....no problem tho.. plenty of people to watch outside the doors off the strip!!!",

A few limp jalapeno slices, a few crumbles of chorizo on the fries doesn't justify the upcharge. SUPER tangy lemonade, but probably necessary to go with quite bland and greasy fish batter. The fish inside was definitely fresh and flaky. We went for the experience and felt confident because this place is owned by someone who regularly critiques food at other restaurants. I get it, of course it's takeout style, but that doesn't mean it has to be meh. It's touristy and people try it for the same reason we did, but it's not worth it.",

They have 4 types of sauces you can choose from, I tried the curry mango (I think) and the tartar, both were very good.

The fish batter was light,  didn't fall off when I took a bite, and crunchy. The fries were at the right texture of crispy outside and soft potato goodness on the inside.  Now with the sauces... As soon as I had the Mango and Curry sauce I was in Love. If Curry ain't your thing then the house tarter sauce was the perfect balance of mayo and acidity.  Second time, I ordered the Dirty #3 on the chips side. The chorizo, jalapenos, and red onions are a plentiful. Flavors of the Chipotle sauce are noted through the entire box/dish.   Service was great and fast both times. Restaurant was clean and will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.   Cheers.",

My friend and i ordered the fish n chip combo and upgraded the regular fries to the dirty chips.  The combo comes with a 3 large pieces of the fish. The breading on the outside was thin, light and crispy and fish was moist and meaty on the inside.  You also get to choose 2 sauces for each combo you order. We both ordered the tarter sauce and then had the curry mango and srirscha aioli. Curry mango was good. A little sweet with curry taste but not overwhelming. The best was the sriracha aioli. Had a bit of kick that made it perfect with the fish and chips.d  So the fries we ordered was: Dirty #1 which has chipotle, jalapeno and chorizo. This had a spicy kick to it with a good amount of chorizo and onions and jalapeno on top.  Dirty #2 was the truffle, parmesan garlic. This was my absolute favorite. I just love garlic and you have a kick of the garlic parmesan with every bite. Not overwhelming at all. Perfect with every bite.  You can upgrade your combo from regular fires to the dirty fries for only $2 more. Which is pretty good deal.  This place is a must try. Fish n dirty chips..simply amazing. Will not disappoint!",

Any of the \"dirty fries\" options are delicious, not to mention the refreshing specialty lemonades. If you've got a sweet tooth and are still hungry after all of that, treat yourself to a sticky pudding shake and you will never experience greater joy.   All of that being said, you definitely pay for what you get. The fact that it is top quality food coupled with the fact that it's on the Strip is going to drive the price right up--we're talking $14+ for a combo with fish, fries and a drink. The tourists don't seem to mind, though, as there is always a line (moves quickly) and the place is packed. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area!",

    "text": "This place has become our usual stop in Vegas. How did they get fried fish so right? Like seriously? The beer batter and the fresh shrimp or fish...mmmm.  So we came here because we are big Gordon Ramsey fans. His food hasn't disappointed us this far. He has taught many restaurants to make fish and chips on one of his shows. So here we go, a whole restaurant highlighting his famous fish and chips.   It is perfectly placed in the LINQ promenade where you can walk around, gamble a little bit, eat, walk around for dessert, take pics, and gamble some more. It catches your eye with the British flag painted on the logo on the outside.   We waited in line and ordered off such a simple menu. We had to hunt down someone who was finishing up and take their seats. We've been lucky the two times we've been here. As we take our seats we get to choose our drinks and boy do I like their soda machine!! You have so many options and can put any syrup in any soda.   As we patiently waited for our number to be called, I was reminded at how fresh the food is. It's never waiting but always right out of the fryer and into the box and then, my number is called and then I chow down!   I prefer the shrimp and chips over the fish but my husband like the fish. The fish is a cod and is too fishy for my palate. I just always like shrimp. The shrimp is placed on top of a large amount of fries. I've gotten the truffle and parmesan before and it was too heavy for me but it was really good!! This time I got the bacon bacon cheddar fries (yes, bacon is said twice), and I was impressed! It has real cheddar on the fries and chunks of bacon. Crazy!! My husband got the spicy fries and he loves them!   So..then the magical moment arrives..when I can bite into a beer battered fried shrimp! Yeah!! I put it on my fork dipped it into the southwestern ranch sauce, put that beauty in my mouth and I didn't want the moment to stop. Mmmm...just simple, fresh, and good quality. Gordon Ramsey always has fresh meat so I can guarantee that the shrimp was never frozen. The batter gave a nice crunch and the shrimp had a bite that said it was cooked but not over cooked.   The southwestern ranch sauce is my fav. It had a smoothness that calmed down the oil of the batter. My husband loves the curry mango sauce. I do have to admit, that sauce taste just like curry. So awesome!   Come here with your camera ready, take pics with your food or just of your food...and enjoy the experience.",

It's a staple on my restaurant tours and I look for greatness whenever I can; I was hoping for that from Gordon Ramsay. I went in about 8:00 pm, so not late, especially considering this is Vegas.  I ordered my dinner and the young guy behind the cash register was very friendly: so far, a good start. I ordered my fish and chips as well as my sauce and took a seat, and a few minutes later my food was up.  The fries almost tasted as if they were double-fried just to heat them up. They were honestly some of the worst fries I ever had so I only ate about three of them. The serving of fish was three small pieces with uninspired breading. It honestly tasted like it was frozen from a bag at Kroger's.  The sauces were good, but having bad fish with good sauce is like having Roseanne Barr dance on the hood of a Jaguar in a Whitesnake video... confusing and disappointing.",

We ordered the fish + chips combo ($14.99), 3 pc fish a la carte ($8.99), and the peach and ginger lemonade.  The fish was lightly fried and super flakey. In combination with the sauces (in order of my favorites: curry mango, sriracha aioli, sw ranch, and tartar), it was exactly what I was looking for in a light-mid lunch.   Standout was the peach and ginger lemonade. Definitely try this!  Seating is limited, and a little strange (lots of bar seats facing the wall), but customer turnover is quick so just wait it out.

We definitely hunt for good fish, and usually wouldn't come to the Strip just to pick up food but they were worth it.   Also try their other flavors of Lemonade. At first I was skeptical, but then of course was proven wrong! I was surprised my boo liked the Ginger Lemonade! I liked the Vanilla one  and if you're nice they'll let you get a refill for a dollar!

Uplifting to get a Scottish Ale with the food. Too pricey for fish and chips that are not spectacular, especially for being Gordon Ramsay. I don't need to go back for more. Very small eatery, we got lucky sitting on stools outside, which was nice on the promenade.",

We were lucky to grab a table as someone was leaving. Very limited menu, but it's not about variety it's about the fish! We weren't very hungry and 2 of us were able to share the 3 piece fish without chips (fries).  Good was good, not too greasy and not overly breaded. Price wasn't too bad. Not a 5 star restaurant, but worth the trip",

If your thinking your going to sit and eat, WRONG! there's like 3 little tables and a bar against the wall with maybe 5 stools. 2. The fish was good, but very greasy. Fries were nice.  All in all I thought (with Ramsey being as meticulous  as he shows he is on TV) this place would be a lot more than it was. I know it's in Vegas, bet where else to display yourself. I left satisfied that I ate, but disappointed in the execution.  Gordon Ramsey, you can do better. 5 restaurants in Las Vegas and you couldn't spring for room for your customers? SHM",

So, ya know those cute bright red UK style phone booths that Americans love so dearly? K, picture that for a moment. Now, picture walking inside a \"restaurant\" ordering your Fish N Chips and then trying to find a table inside that cutesy phone booth. Dude. For a guy with $1.2 billion (US) and countless investors looking to ride the cash train, how in the world did you decide in this location? Bruh!! I will take partial responsibility for assuming that a celebrity chef would have an actual restaurant, not a phone booth!!  Now that we have that stuff on the table, the food is on point. I have never been to the UK, despite my level 4 obsession with the British accent (birds/not chaps) and all, so I cannot compare this version that the real version. Yelp is gonna need to reassess the $$ on account of the fact that place, with the Vegas cost enhancement, is super overpriced. In fact, it's bloody dreadful dear. Just dreadful. Now, I suspect this would be an issue if all of us didn't line the streets to head inside the phone booth to elbow each other in the side and push each other over to get the grub!!!  I am picky and I have a lot to say. More often than not, I have extremely high expectations, which I have learned lead to even bigger letdowns. That's me and that's all. Now you are aware that if you show up with a party of 5, ya'll will be holding on to your box of grub and chatting it up against the wall as other folks elbow you in the ribs attempting to find space in the room to simply dip the fish or chip in the tasty little sauce cups.",

They have an interesting choice if sauces to go with your fish and chips but the fish itself was a little too oily- i know it s fried but i have had fish and chips at least 15 times in my life and i can safely say that I know a fresh, light and crispy fried piece of fish from a heavy and oily one. The truffle fries that i got were nice but the spicy ones my husband got were lacking flavor- i think the chef forgot to add salt. They have a cool techie screen like thing for getting your soft beverages from and the decor is very suggestive of a british vibe(obviously ) but i was left wanting more.",

We got in line, looked at the menu while waiting, and ordered.  The prices are very reasonable by the way!  While waiting for our food, we found a seat for just us two. Our food came in no time, yet, unfortunately they got our order wrong.  We ordered one Fish&Chips and one Sausage&Chips. Instead they have us two Fish&Chips. So they had us keep what we already had while they remake the Sausage&Chips. Took about 10 minutes.  BUT I WILL SAY, THE FOOD IS AMAZING! The fish is fresh and moist with light and tasteful batter. The fries were good. The sausage was quite different.  But It was a good different. Definitely chef inspired!!!!  The lemonade was a mixture of delight!!!!  You can definitely tell this menu is chef inspired.  I'm not sure why the pop machine is right next to the ketchup dispenser. They need to figure out a better system for that. Other than that, I was quite satisfied with my experience.",

And yes, you should upgrade to the dirty chips. I recommend Dirty #2 - Truffle, Parmesan and Chives, three matches made it heaven. Also, they have a lot of sauces to choose from: Curry Mango, Sriracha Aioli, Southwest Ranch, European Style Mayo, Tartar Sauce, and Ketchup. I went with the Aioli and the Tartar (of course), and was not disappointed  The decor of this place is adorable, with the entrance/exit doors resembling phone booths in London, it's too cute.   Give this place a try, it's exactly what you'll be craving after drinking all day on the strip! Too bad the actual Gordon isn't here. It would be entertaining to watch him yell at his staff, ahah just kidding.",

Fish and chips - Fish was breaded well but way too oily and no seasoning; OTOH, fries were absolutely caked in salt, making them completely inedible. One of the workers had a huge attitude when we asked for replacement fries.  Shrimp - I really liked these and they were much better than the fish, but the cocktail sauce was half frozen...  The other problem is that the dining areas are tiny, so pretty much any time it's even remotely busy there will be no place to sit. I get that takeaway fish and chips is pretty popular with our friends across the Atlantic, but it really doesn't work on the Strip when relatively \"close\" hotels are nevertheless still a 15-20min walk away.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips...Need I say more...YES!!!  This restaurant is freaking amazing.  I love fish and chips and honestly usually end up fairly disappointed because the batter just isn't right or the chips are soggy. THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE!  We walked in with a party of 4 right after they opened at 11am.  There were a few people in line and a few people at tables.  There was one table of 4 available so we grabbed that and went to order.  We all ordered the fish and chips.  Along with the fish and chips, you get the choice of two sauces.  There are many choices.  I went for the tartar and the mango curry.  I am not a huge mango person but it sounded interesting so I went for it.  The chips were very good, thick cut, firm and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  They were well salted and tasted great.  Now the fish, OMG, it was divine!  The fish tasted extremely fresh.  There was no overbearing fish taste, just nice and clean. The fish was cooked perfectly.  It was flaky, moist and glistening.  The batter was the best I have ever had.  The batter was thick but not too thick.  It was crispy, beautiful golden brown and light.    The sauces are great!  You can tell these are not some bottled sauces sitting on a shelf for a long period of time.  They are fresh, the flavors pop and they add so much flavor to an already flavorful meal.  I personally loved the mango curry.  It was light, had a slight curry taste, mildly fruity and amazing, they need to bottle this because I would buy it!  The tartar was good and the ranch was also good but I will be dreaming of that mango curry on that wonderful fish.  I will absolutely be coming back every single time I am in Vegas! FYI...The restaurant is located in the Linq Promenade and has both inside and outside seating.",

The chips were the best part but there's thousands of British Chippies which do a far better job. After a 30 minute wait and $9 for parking this is the most disappointing experience I've had at a GR spot.",

I appreciated the fact that it did not dominate my taste buds and complemented the interior contents. Gordon's tartar sauce was spot on and the chips were decent, but nothing to write home about. There is also a secret menu item called \"The G Spot\" which contains fish, shrimp and chicken.",

We ordered the standard fish & chips ($15.99), which comes with a soda. DH wanted a ginger peach lemonade and he was able to upgrade for another $1 or so. We got a cup for water which was only 49 cents...a steal by Vegas standards. Seating is very limited. I was able to snag a table by the door.  They seem to be quite efficient. Gordon would be proud (and he wouldn't need to cuss the staff out). Food was ready quickly. Everything was hot and crispy. The batter on the fish was incredibly light and crunchy. There were 3 pieces of fish - more than sufficient for a meal. Fish seemed to be cod, fresh with a firm texture. The fries were just like classic \"chips\" - crunchy on the outside, hearty potato on the inside. Lots of options for sauces, but we picked the chipole aioli (really good, but more garlicky than spicy) and tartare sauce (classic). They also have ketchup and malt vinegar with the utensils.  We weren't that hungry and split one order. So full and we couldn't finish the fries. The couple next to us ordered one combo per person and they couldn't finish their orders. This stuff is quite dense!  DH says, \"I think the best part was the fish batter, that was light and not overly greasy. The fish itself was not overcooked. It was technically well executed.\" DH thought the lemonade was way too sweet. The flavor combo did have potential. Not a good value for $5 since it's just a regular size drink.  Would we go back? Probably, but we do want to try other restaurants first.",

The sizes they give you is so appealing, nice sized portions of lobster & shrimp although small in variety for $20. However, I don't like biting into a ball of grease along with it. I'm not sure what's missing here but the food is entirely way too greasy for me, one bite lubricates my entire face. it's just nasty, I honestly couldn't even finish my meal, I had to discard it. The lobster had too much sodium for my liking but I can't fault them for that because I am sensitive to salt. The flow is also really slow, maybe a kiosk or two could help move things along. I waited a little longer than expected because two employees wanted to finish their conversation before taking my order, that also had no reflection in my rating. It's overpriced for four pieces of seafood & a handful of fries, that is all",

Fish was cooked perfectly, chips were cooked perfectly, and the sauces were perfect accompaniments. Thankfully, that's all you really need to get right to be an excellent Fish & Chips restaurant!",

    "text": "I had been waiting to visit this place, and although it was raining on the day I had set to visit, we decided to brave the rain and go anyway. From the outside, it was very easy to identify with its big English sign and bright red doors that stood out even at night.   We ordered the 2  Fish and Chips and also a side of the Shrimp to try both and ordered it with the Mango-Curry, Sriracha, Southwest Ranch and regular cocktail sauces. For the Fish: My husband's fish was slightly over cooked, it was dry on the inside. My fish came out cooked perfectly. It was really good, but lacking just a tad bit of salt on the batter. The Shrimp turned out to be our favorite. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The shrimp was not lacking anything and honestly is my favorite out of the two items. I really liked the mango curry sauce as well, I definitely recommend trying it.   The service was great, all employees working were friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was great, the place is smaller than I anticipated for a Las Vegas restaurant, so I highly  recommend avoiding the really busy dinner times.",

    "text": "How cool that Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips was directly outside the hotel that we were staying at while in Vegas! My excitement was through the roof. When I saw that this had come up on the Strip, I had bookmarked it and was eagerly waiting for the chance to go in.  I believe that I like fish & chips more than the average person, but found that here, both were super tasty - better than at other places! What was even better though was the choice of sauce that came with the fish & chips! My husband and I ordered just one box with Gordon's Tartar Sauce & Sriracha Aioli. The box with 3 pieces of fish was large enough for the two of us to share. Normally when we share, my husband eats more of it than I do but this time, I was stealing as many bites as I could! Of course if I had really wanted to, I could have probably eaten the whole thing by myself (and been really full after) but resisted.  Overall, we felt that the price was fair due to the quantity. I did pay extra to get a Orange & Vanilla Lemonade in lieu of a pop. That's probably the only thing I wouldn't get next time since the lemonade was way too tart and they have the fancy pop machine with a variety of flavors! Recommended!",

I expected a nice and crispy fish fry with a good amount of golden chips as my friends reviewed before. I ordered a fish and chips combo with Gordon's tartar sauce (which was amazing) and the dijon mayonnaise. The fish was good and crispy, not soggy at all and perfectly fried. The chips were fluffy on the inside and golden fried on the outside, which reflects my taste for fries. So overall, I really liked this restaurant and will make returns in the soon future.",

I really like how crispy the food was, it did not disappoint. I absolutely loved the sauce, which it comes with. You had 4 choices there was curry sauce and Gordon tarter sauce.

Not too heavy and greasy at all for the amount of crunch.  But the fish!!!!!!  You hear the term melt in your mouth, but this fish actually did!  I've never tasted cod this good.  The Gordon's Tartar lovely and we also tried the sriracha sauce that had a very gentle kick.  The color scheme of the place made the experience complete.  It was a wonderful stop on our walk!",

Although the one guy who was going all the food prep was chomping away on a piece of gum which to me is a major turn off.    As for the food, we loved the fries. And the fish we were divided on. My stepdaughter and I thought it was just okay and my wife really enjoyed it.  To me it was a bit greasy and tasteless.  There tarter was really good and you needed it to give the fish any flavor.  I got the fishwich, which was not a sandwich it was more like tacos and they were a complete mess to eat.  So it wasn't bad, but with all the great options in the area I don't see me going back.

Chicken okay, and the fish was on point. The dirty fries were a bit greasy for my liking. I gave them to my friend.   Employees were very kind. It was fun to check out.

If you haven't seen it yet, catch it on YouTube!  Anyways, tried this place for the first time a couple months ago when I was in Vegas & this place did not disappoint  my initial reaction going in was \"how good can a fish and chips place be?\" But if you have master chef Gordan Ramsey behind all of it, it really is THAT GOOD. Everything was very flavorful without being overpowering. He also has a list of sauces that you could try that go perfectly with the fish or chips. Amongst the many delicious things you could eat in Vegas, definitely give this place a try if you're looking for a smaller meal than the infamous buffets aha.",

The wait time for the food is also very reasonable as they are constantly frying fish and chips up fresh and hot. The presentation was also very appetizing, it looked so damn good when it was presented to me, but then came the tasting and this is where it all went South! The chips were absolutely horrible, they were dry and had zero flavor, they virtually had no seasoning on them at all, a little sea salt would have at least helped with flavor, the dryness though probably couldn't be helped, they don't appear overcooked, but man they were just super dry. The fish looked amazing, a beautiful golden brown, nice big pieces, it looked wonderful! But alas no, the fish though crunchy on top and all sides, was a soggy mess on the bottom , the fish though a nice quality was mushy and soft, not firm and flaky as I had hoped for, and again just absolutely flavorless. The malt vinegar comes in packets and is of poor quality and did nothing to enhance the flavorless fish. It seems they rely on the sauces available to provide the flavor to the food, but I believe a good quality fish and chips should stand in their own! Very disappointed especially for the price point! Ellis Island has delicious fish and chips for half the price. Sorry I cannot recommend this spot, go to EI or Crown and Anchor for a much better Fish and Chips experience!",

    "text": "Excellent fish&chips, the British classic right next to Linq Hotel on the Linq Promenade. One portion (around $15) includes 3 generous pieces of flaky white cod lightly battered and super crunchy, generous portion of  crisp not oily fries, 2 sauces (tartare and dijon mayonnaise were delucious) and a fountain drink (they have a nice touch screen drink dispenser).   You can swap for 'dirty' fries, e.g. with truffle and parmesan or upgrade to a beer for 4$ extra domestic or 5$ for import.   They also have a sausage, fish sandwich and lobster and shrimp, but you should try the London classic cod first!   Easy, delicious, affordable!",

I ordered the fish & chips with #1 dirty chips (chipotle, jalapeno, and crisp chorizo).  I got the curry & mango and sriracha aioli to go with it all.  Both sauces were on point, but the curry & mango stole the show.  Fish was fried just right and the beer batter was crispy and not the least bit soggy.    So, if you find yourself near The Linq, get yourself some Fish & Chips from Gordon Ramsey's...super good.  Seating is pretty limited, but they have outside seating as well so you can people watch while you eat.",

    "text": "One of the new comers to the strip and places I've been excited to try is Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips.  Located in the Linq Promenade is a good shopping and entertainment area to check out on the Vegas strip.  GRF&C has a rather simple menu you fried items fries, fish shrimp and chicken.  As well as some amazing shakes which I will get to a little bit later.  In addition to classic fish & chips that are simple, but still really really good you have a couple of dipping sauces  (6) besides your usual tarter sauce.  I went with the fish and chips with siracha aioli and mango curry dipping sauces.  Both sauces were really good better than tarter sauce.  If you had to get only one I would go with the siracha aioli, thought the mango curry is still good.  The siracha sauce really enhances the fish and chips.  As far as the fried fish is concerned it was superb.  Nice thick layer of fried beer batter and the and the tenderness of the fish is excellent.  These are the best version of fish and chips I've had and couldn't imagine it getting any better.  They were so good you could almost imagine chef Gordon made them just for you.  The fries were good, my one recommendation if your going for the trifecta is to upgrade your fries to some of the other versions they have.    As good as the fish and chips were the ultimate kicker is the shakes.  I tried the Bischoff shake which I think is an English cookie.  Man this shake was good.  It kind of taste similar to cookie butter.  You know when you try something so good, you remember the whole experience?, this is that kind of shake. I've had a shake at one of his other restaurant Burger and this shake was even better than the one I had over there which was still good.  This shake has entered my top five shakes of all time.    GRF&C is one of the best places to get something to eat that is really good at a great value.  This place was the best overall place I tried during my last trip to Vegas.  I would come back again and again even if it was just to try another shake.",

It makes you want to tape it and send it to Ramsay for one of his shows...the service is not bad its just not enough, they have way too much work and a super slow chain of work plus its only one person making all the orders. From start line to delivery it took over 35 min, so if you are in a hurry, starving and would like to sit and take a break: THIS IS NOT THE SPOT.",

Portion is good enough for sharing if you fill up fast.   Cleanliness / Ambiance: 3 Clean seating areas, drink station could use a little more TLC. The way the restaurant is set up makes for a traffic nightmare especially during peak hours at lunch or dinner.  Flavor / Quality: 3.5 4 stars for the quality of the cod. Cooked to perfection and perfectly flaky. This is NOT your regular fish stick. They make the batter from scratch and dredge the fish just before they deep fry it. Fries are crispy and delicious. Sauces are bomb as well. 3 stars for the heavy batter used. Food left me feeling bloated and extra heavy.  Value: 4 For the size of the serving and the fact that the order is essentially a combo: fish, chips, soda. This is a good deal!  Service: 4 Quick, easy, no frills menu!  Average score: 3.625",

We were walking around, got hungry,  and it was the closest thing.  Thw menu is limited.  Fish n chips.  I think they also had chicken and shrimp.  But all 6 of us got the fish n chips.  We were all pleased.  The fish was fresh and very thick.  Batter was very crispy.  The fries were very good too.  It was alot of food but we finished it all.  Maybe we were just hungry but the next day my dad ordered fish n chips at another place because he craved it again.  He said not as good as Ramsay's.  We all agreed.  It comes with tartar and one other sauce.  We tried them all between us.  My favorite was the curry.  Place:  small.  Very limited tables.  We went during a very very late lunch so we got lucky.    Service:  service was good. Food came out quick.  Value:  each combo fish n chips is about $15.  But there is plenty of food.",

    "text": "I've heard great things about this place and finally made the special trip this weekend. Located at the Linq promenade, it's pretty easy to find (near Las Vegas Blvd). The first thing I noticed is that the place is small. However you can easily find a seat since people are constantly coming in and out (It's not really a place you hang out for hours chatting...at least that's the vibe I got). I got there at about 8:45pm and there was a huge line, although it moved quicker than I thought. Anyways, onto the food!  Shrimp and chips (regular fries): the shrimp must've been marinated or stuffed with something bc I noticed it had cilantro on the shrimp when I bite into it. The shrimp was sooo delicious. It was juicy and cooked perfectly. It was not rubbery and honestly, I was shocked at how tasty it was. The 2 sauces I got was curry mango and siracha aioli. Both are bomb! I think my fave would be curry mango as I'm a huge fan of anything curry. The batter is light and on its own it doesn't have much of a flavor but that's what the sauces are for!  Fish and chips (upgrades to Parmesan truffle fries): I love anything truffle too so I'm in love with the fries. The fish doesn't have much flavor on its own, however, it was cooked perfectly and was flakey. The 2 sauces was GR tartar sauce and southwestern sauce. Tartar sauce is a must and it paired well with the fish. I thought the southwestern sauce was eh, not my fave.   Both dishes were cooked perfectly and I think it's a great plus for Las Vegas. I'm glad this place isn't close to my house or else my waistline would be in trouble. Come give this place a try!",

It did help the chips get some much needed moisture though. The peach & ginger lemonade was good, but they should just call it ginger lemonade. Super gingery, but I love ginger, so it worked for me. They did a refill on my lemonade for a dollar, so that was good.",

We came here smack in the middle of the day, so there were a lot of people crammed in the little sitting area. I had my boyfriend go up and order our food, while I secured two seats at the counter in the front. While we enjoyed our food, and the price value is on point (about $16 for chicken & chips and a soda), it didn't leave a lasting impression like Gordon Ramsay's Burger. In my boyfriend's opinion, the 3 chicken pieces you get are a little on the smaller side and too greasy for his liking. I really liked the chips, but would have to agree with him on the chicken.",

This place looked so cute that I had to give it a try. My friend and I decided we were going to split a meal since we already ate less than 10 minutes prior to seeing this place. After ordering we did struggle trying to find a place to sit but got lucky and found two stools outside. When our food came out it was super hot so instead of eat we took pictures of the food instead. When the food finally cooled down we took our first bites were left speechless. Hands down the best fish and chips we've both ever had. The fish was fresh and had no scent to it and the batter was perfectly fried! This place has turned into a must stop by restaurant whenever I come to Vegas from here on out.",

I have to say that the fish was the best fish and chips I ever had. I've been to a few places that were known for their great fish and chips yet none of them had the quality of fish and chips we had in this place. The fish was very well cooked and very crispy on the outside but still maintained its tenderness on the inside. The fries were not as good as I was hoping for. Perhaps my friends hyped it up too much and set my expectations extremely high.   Overall I think this is a good place for fish and chips if you are into it.",

The line was not too long when we got here around 6:15pm on a Saturday. Ordering was a breeze and the food was ready in 5 minutes. Finding seats for four, however, took longer. This place is pretty small so there isn't a ton of seating. We waited around for tables to open and had to split into two groups.  We all went for the fish and chips combo, which comes with three pieces of fish, a lot of fries, two sauces, and a soft drink for $14.99. The fish was AMAZING--perfectly crispy on the outside and unbelievably moist and tender on the inside. I loved the sauces I chose--curry & mango and sriracha aioli. I honestly could have eaten another order or two of the fish because it was that good. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Vegas!",

We came on a Friday during lunchtime and it was crowded but the line moved fast and we were able to grab a table for the 5 of us inside.   My husband and I shared the GR Combo, which is not printed on the menu but is a piece of chicken, 2 pieces of fish and 2 large fried shrimp with fries for $17.95. It includes 2 sauces (we selected the sriracha aoli and tartar sauce) and a fountain drink. It was more than enough for both of us to share. The fish was the best by far and next time we would just order fish and chips, although the chicken was juicy and tender and the shrimp was good but the batter was on the sweeter side. The fries were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside but still soft potato on the inside and salted perfectly.   The employees were all very friendly and smiled and thanked us for coming in. Excellent lunch on the cheaper side while walking the strip!",

The place was busy and table seating was at a premium.  There are a couple counters where diners can sit on one of the few stools available or stand to eat their food.  The same counter arrangement was outside which provided seating for very few.  Additionally, the restaurant was not handicap accessible.  I was in a wheelchair and had a terrible time getting in/out of the restaurant.   The food, as I said, was delicious!  We would have been extremely dissatisfied if it wasn't.  Price wise, it was fair because the portions  were large and filling.  We had no question about the freshness of our food because there were a lot people there and food was being prepared as fast as possible to keep up without skimping of quality one bit.  Food alone would definitely get at LEAST 5 stars!  The accommodations are what drops it to a 3.",

We ordered just the standard box of three pieces of fish fried in their special batter, over a bed of their regular fries...and it was like nothing else. Comes with your choice of any two of their combination of sauces (all extremely delicious but i recommend the sriracha aioli and Gordon's tartar sauce) AND a refillable soft drink of your choosing (they have one of those pop fountains that I've only seen at the Coca cola factory in Atlanta). All that for $14.99 in a city where prices of food keep going up is quite a deal!  Choose the good ol classic fish and chip combo without anything extra on the chips - because anything else would take away from the True Gordon Ramsey experience.   And, GOTTA LOVE THAT BATTER (super light, flaky, not too greasy, and omg you gotta try it)  FYI: for those of you who are allergic to tilapia (I am, for some weird reason), you have my word that the fish is NOT tilapia!",

    "text": "We ordered the fish and shrimp with the truffle fries, I also got a peach ginger lemonade.   The first bite was exceptionally better than the last few for both the fish and shrimp. The first few bites were really great, however both items were so greasy that by the time we finished eating we were left with that queasy feeling in your throat. The fries were actually better than I had thought since I read a few negative reviews on yelp before ordering. I don't eat pork and the other French fry upgrades both had bacon or chorizo. The truffle fries were done in a simple and classic way, nothing was too overpowering, and we really did enjoy this item. The peach ginger lemonade though was way too sour and not as peachy as I would have liked. In fact I ended up switched to water instead.   I was definitely disappointed with my dining experience here. It seemed as if everything we ordered was too greasy or too sour to finish.   I did like the fact that it was a fast and (more) affordable dining option on the strip, unfortunately we won't be coming back due to our experience with the food.",

I didn't think too much of it to be honest, but I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had good fish & chips in a while, the last time was when i was in England a few years ago and this definitely hit the spot!  I should of known better, it is Gordon Ramsay's after all, he does not disappoint. The batter on the fish was spot on (the fish was very juicy) and the different sauces that came with it are a very nice touch. Damn tasty, very well done GR!   The restaurant was packed but the service was relatively quick. If you are going in a group, make sure part of the group is on the look out for a table. You do not get seated, you order at the register and then pick up your food at the end. This is a great option if you are looking for a meal on the cheaper side and don't want to stuff your face at the buffets.",

We ordered the fish and chips (of course) and the chicken and chips. Both of them were wonderful! There were too many fries for us to finish. I didn't think the portions were going to be so big, and the prices were bad either. Each of our meals came with three dipping sauces.

Outside of a little stand in Kilmore Quay, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips is the best I've ever had.  It's to the point where I refuse to eat Fish & Chips anywhere in Vegas because all others are disgusting compared to this. I eat here at least twice a month.   I actually wanted to take a star or two away for two reasons. 1)It's difficult to get to because its on the Linq promenade just off the strip. 2) The seating is horrible. Good luck finding a table!! But the Fish & Chips is sooo delicious that I couldn't take stars away for that.",

I had to see if I was paying for his name, or the food was just on point.   I am happy to say, it was amazing.  We asked people sitting outside first, and they said best fries they have ever had. I'll have to agree, the fish was also a good size.  It came with 2 different sauces. The tarter was by far my favorite. My husband is a lifted and eats a ton and this was plenty for both of us to share as a in between meal from lunch-dinner.  If I wasn't vacationing I could eat it daily.   The fish was also fried beautifully, and didn't taste burnt or like it was cooked in old grease.  So glad we were able to try it.",

You'd think a celebrity chef like him would not have time to pay attention to all the minute details of his restaurant empire, but he is one super chef that has managed to do it all. Not only are his shows like masterchef (junior) and hell's kitchen so successful, but his restaurants' food quality and service are top notch. His name sake's fish and chips is no exception. Really the best fish and chips we've ever had, and we've had a lot of fish and chips. Perfect light crispy batter and tender moist flaky fish. A quick order and go type of small food stand, but worth the visit if on the Vegas strip.

Especially if you are visiting Las Vegas and trying to narrow down your choices in dining establishments, this should be on your list.   The. Best. Fish and Chips. I've ever had. PERIOD.  I got my chips dirty mix #2, which were the truffle, parmesan and chives chips. Other seasoning choices include the jalapeno, chipotle and chorizo flavor, and calcinatory spice and basil.   The fish was fresh and flaky, the batter had just the perfect amount of crispiness to it, and the fries were fresh and hot.  I loved that there were a variety of dipping sauces to choose from too!  I tried the curry and mango, and Gordon's tarter sauce.  Both did NOT disappoint!  Yum!    I highly recommend this place if:  1)  you are a big fan of Gordon Ramsay; 2)  are a fish and chips enthusiast;  3) you appreciate excellent tasting, fresh food; 4)  and/or you don't want to be disappointed when leaving a restaurant.  This place is pretty casual, small,  and if the weather suits you, there are a few seats outside.  It's location is right off of a main walkway, so there is opportunity for good people watching if you sit outside (if you're into that sort of thing).  Staff was friendly and the establishment was clean.  They serve Pepsi products, but they have one of those cool flavor machines, which makes it more fun!  What more could you ask for?  It's been two days since we had Gordon's fish and chips, and my kids and I were just saying that we'd wish we could have more already!  We love you, Chef Ramsay!",

However, after eating at this fish and chips place, I learned a lot about the dish.  I feel I learned that the fish's main purpose is to provide amazing texture flavored by salt and whatever spices the chef can add.  The fish isn't supposed to be overwhelmingly flavorful.  A lot of fish and chip places have fish that just crumbles or falls apart.  However, this place NAILS IT.  Having become my favorite fish and chips place, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant provides affordable, super tasty options!  We ordered the regular fish and chips with the curry sauce and house tartar sauce.    THAT TARTAR SAUCE THO.  WOW. SOOO GOOD.  The combination of the fish's amazing composure and perfect amount of seasoning along with the tartar sauce's flavor created such a beautiful experience for us.    I recommend sharing one fish and chips amount 2-3 people because it can get pretty heavy.  Give the other sauces a try as well!",

The shrimp is easily above expectations too... perfectly cooked, light and greaseless.  The menu is super simple. Fish or shrimp with chips. Minimal options are a good thing! When you do something exceedingly well, don't mess it up with too many options! Have to say, \"We'll done, Gordon! You definitely live up to the hype!\" My wife and I will be back whenever we're in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Just spent a few days in Vegas and this was by far the worst meal of the weekend. We love Gordon Ramsey, and fish and chips are top of the list of our favorite foods. I was a little skeptical since it was more fast food but we figured it was worth a shot. While I waited for what felt like forever, I watched the cooks stumble around and try to figure out what they were cooking. I should have known right there we were in for a bad meal.  My boyfriend and I each paid extra for the specialty fries and oh my word, they were terrible!! So overcooked I could have thrown them through the window. The fish was just blah, very little flavor. We spent almost $40 and I could have gotten better fish at a dive bar in my home town for 1/4 the price. Anytime I eat at an establishment with Gordon Ramsey's name on it I have high expectations, and I was very disappointed this time. I would never go back here or recommend it. They need to hire some people who know how to cook or this place won't be in business very long on the strip.",

The place might be small, but it's packed with a lot of fun and a joyful eating experience. Loved the design of the place as it sticks out with its bright British colors! This will always be a must stop for me whenever I'm in Vegas!",

It clearly shows that they care about the food they put out. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is very clean. My only MINOR complaint would be that they don't have much seating, but tables turn quickly.   Ask for the secret special - One fish, one chicken and two shrimp plus chips (fries for us Americans) and drink. Spend the $$ and the the Dirty #1 chips - WELL worth it. YUM!  This is ABSOLUTELY the best fast food (not tasting like fast food - they just are efficient in serving) in Las Vegas.",

The fish was greasy and completely void of any seasoning or flavor. I ate about 1/3 of it and threw the rest out after my hunger was somewhat sated. Out of the 10 or so meals I had while visting Vegas this was hands down the worst.   I really don't understand how this place has Gordons name on it. Its the complete opposite of everything he stands for in cooking.  Once again, do not waste your money here, there are so many other great places to eat in the area.",

The only thing that wasn't spelled out on the menu was upgrading to the \"dirty\" fries with the combo meals. It's only a $1/$2 more. I personally went with natural sea salt fries and malt vinegar. I did the classic fish and chips combo with a spiked ginger lemonade (which was worth the extra charge). My girlfriends tried the dirty fries and loved it. Over all our meals was great, the fish was fresh and we had just enough time to grab napkins and condiments before our numbers were called. The staff was friendly and professional. Towels ($13), hats ($20?) and T-shirt's ($30) were available for purchase. If you can't stop at once of his more upscale locations I would highly recommend squeezing this in and it was super convenient being located right outside of our hotel, the Flamingo.",

    "text": "This chippy made me wanna jump up and slap Gordon Ramsay.  Many visits to the UK  and a huge fan of this simple dish left me wondering why it was adulterated for the US?  I'll explain but first, the fish; fresh, air flown cod (to me better than haddock), salted and rested to firm up the texture then batter coated and fried.  Crisp on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside.  A little greasy but all good.  British style tartar sauce and ketchup check.  And then...  Chips - What happened to the thick cut, crisp, fluffy chips?  Why serve an thin cut, anemic American French fries?  They don't absorb the malt vinegar (which is also missing) or give that welcome texture against the crisp fish  I want more; pickles - pickled onions, pickled shallots, pickled quail eggs, heck, even mushy peas, something, anything with some acidity to reset the palate after bites of the oily meal.  Double carbs please; buttered bread.  There is none.  How am I supposed to make my chip butty?  Ahhh a pile of chips between two slices of buttered bread, dipped in ketchup between bites.    Though the last two are not deal killers, the American style fries and silly sauces (options include a mango curry, ranch dressing, and a siracha aioli) destroys that which makes the dish so good.  Sutton & Sons, or Toff's it's not.  Note:  Want to try the dish right?  Check out Gordon Ramsay's Pub.  Just a few bucks more, a world of difference.  Fast food service.  Pricey for what you get.  UK through the eyes of Caesars Entertainment, definitely.",

We got the combo, declined the drink and upgraded to the truffle/Parmesan/chive fries for roughly the same price. The fries were divine - perfectly crisp crunch without being overlooked, and the truffle smelled and tasted wonderfully. The fish was perfectly battered, not at all gummy like it can be when done poorly. No funky flavors, just clean cod taste and light batter. The tartar could have been perhaps a tad more pungent for my tastes, but the mango curry spice was a fun surprise (you get two sauces to try). My only regret is that I shared with my husband. Next time it's all for me.",

For a dollar extra, you can get the lemonade, so I highly suggest you order that with your meal. The cooks seem to move pretty fast. The seating is limited, so your lucky if your able to find a table. This is in the alleyway heading toward the high roller. Line can get pretty long, but it seems to move fast.

I saw that it wasn't very busy on a Saturday evening and was happy I didn't have to wait in a long line and we ordered within minutes of arriving. Very small but modern looking shop with limited seating inside and just a few chairs outside. After placing your order you move to the end of an assembly line to wait for your order. I selected the 3 piece fish combo. It was decently priced, around $14 and it came with your choice of 2 sauces,fries and a drink. I got the ''dirty fries\" #3 option. Dried cacciatore seasoning with fried basil and European mayo for dipping. the seasoning and fried basil were a nice combo but the fries were not great. They seemed overcooked, not sure if they have them fried and then refry them for the order bit they were bad! The fish was cooked perfectly in a crispy batter and was flakey as cod should be when biting into it. I also watched as my order sat on the counter for several minutes while the person at the end of the line tried to fix another customers order. It was nice for him to help but he walked past three other people while they just stood around, not very organized. A return trip, ehh, maybe if I'm nearby I would try it again but not worth planning a trip just for this place.",

Tacked on a Guiness too --why not? The price of beers here were reasonably priced and worth it.  The texture of the the beer battered fish was amazing. A thick chunk of white cod with a perfectly coated crispy, light golden batter (3 giant pieces). Not too heavy and not too light. Just right. The sauces were savory. I absolutely love these kind of fries-- British Style \"Chips\". Perfectly seasoned with sea salt and a slight crunch. I also highly recommend getting the truffle fries! My total came to about $19 -- a tad pricey but the food was definitely Gordon Ramsay quality.",

We had the fish and chips combo with garlic parmesan fries.  3 out of 4 of us ate the fish and my other son just had the fries. Of course and as usual, we enjoyed our dinner.  The next day, all 3 of us who ate the fish had bad stomachs. We thought and thought about what we ate and it was only the fish. My other son did not have any upset stomach because he did not eat the fish.  Since the fish was the only thing we ate last night, we knew it was the fish that made us feel bad.

The seating in this place is limited, be prepared to hover waiting for a seat.  Overall it was tasty but halfway through I had to stop eating because I felt so full from grease.  I have had many fish and chips and have never experienced this sensation before.  Not sure what in particular it was but it was unsettling and the feeling lasted several hours.    Price is spendy, lunch (fish, chips, beer) ran about $20. I would not come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Absolutely Phenomenal! Who knew that this treasure was hidden near Flamingo Hotel.   My family and I were looking for a second meal after an unsatisfactory one at White Castle (see profile for review) and we happened to stumble upon this eyecatching place. One thing that stood out to me was Gordan Ramsay's name, because this man is my idol and I've been a constant fan of his shows like his traveling shows, MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, Hell's Kitchen, etc. so I asked my dad to try this place and he agreed!  LOCATION: Although the store was not in a well-known plaza, it was actually roomy in the inside and had bright blue, red, and white colors that popped. The store had doors shaped like a telephone booth and the colors made me feel like I was taking an actual trip to England. Once you enter the store, you can smell the delicious aroma of mouthwatery fish and chips.   SERVICE: The lady at the register was very attentive and helpful when guests inquire about the menu. She made sure to always smile and even made great recommendations about the sauce and which combo. was better based on personal preference. We were so excited to try the food that we almost left without our drink until she stopped us to give it to us.   CONS:  -Seating: There was only so much seating inside the store that we had to take the food back with us to our hotel room.  -Waste Cans: The trash had piled up and many people couldn't throw away their trash inside in fear of it piling up even more and spilling over. -Chips: They were kind of bland, but I do understand that not a lot of people like salt on their chips. This was easily solved with ketchup for me.    PROS: -Organized: The store itself was sanitary and tables were organized and clean. I also liked how the boxes to carry the fish and chips were very neat and simple, despite carrying wonderful flavors. -Fish and Chips: They were AMAZING and perfectly seasoned with the right amount of acidity. Crispy on the outside, yet glisteningly soft on the inside, the fish just made my day. The condiments that I had were Gordan Ramsay's Tartar Sauce and Dijon Mayonnaise (both light, yet powerful to the taste) and the combination of the sauces and the fish was like heaven to my mouth.   Overall, I would absolutely come to this place again. This is one of Gordan Ramsay's cheaper places, but the food was just as high-end as his other, classier restauraunts. I recommend this for anyone in search of a delicious, fulfilling meal.",

I watch you continuously scream and lecture chefs on TV, so my expectations for your signature dish is pretty damn high, I've mentioned before that it's pretty hard to find quality fish & chips in America, since we Americans somehow always mess it up. But you, Gordan Ramsey, are British... so again my expectations were high.  Located in the LINQ Promenade, the space is pretty small with limited indoor and outdoor seating. Very casual setting compared to his other restaurants. We placed our order at the cashier and waited for the food to be freshly fried. The wait can get long but this gives you time to look for a seat. When we finally tried our food, I must say, in the words of Gordon himself, it was bloody delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside. Comes with 2 dipping sauces of your choice, so I picked the tarter sauce and Dijon mayonnaise. They also have Curry & Mango (sounds interesting), Sriracha Aioli, and Southwest Ranch. Overall, great new addition to the Strip!",

A British classic off the strip in the little walkway towards the Flamingo Hotel. The storefront is everything you'd imagine a fish and chips place to be, the familiar solid red, white and blue with the front doors replicating phone booths. But with the Ramsay named attached I'm sure it's one to be spotted rather than stumbled upon. Not a lot of seating on the inside but there are a few tables outside shared between the other eateries as well so it's easy to get nab a place after getting your food to go.   Fish and Chips ($11.99) Sauces chosen:: Southwest Ranch, Ramsay's Tartar. Tartar sauce is the way to go. Fish was flakey and smooth and fresh, batter was crispy and light, color of the fry was beautiful. French fries were thickly cut and lightly salted. I recommend stopping by to grab a quick bite. One of the best fish and chips' I've had in awhile.",

My friends couldn't eat here due to shrimp allergies ( the oil is mixed in together) so they went across the street to the wing truck which offered seating for all. I had the weekend special, lobster tail and shrimp! Yum!!!!!! Yes, the line was huge but well worth the wait! When is stopped in 20 minutes later to fill my drink, there was no line so it depends on when you go as to how long you will wait. It is well worth it! The one thing I cant give 5 stars for is the smell. Very fishy! I know its a fish and chip restaurant but it can be over bearing with no, well felt like no, A/C or refreshed air",

Tip: ask for 2 gourmet sauces vs tartar with only 1 gourmet sauce. No thank you to the tartar. Boring.   Although the \"dirty\" chip flavors cost extra, it's totally worth it. I always get the truffle, Parmesan, chives. Deeeliissshhhhousss. Go get your fish n chips!!!",

Then, I watched them make it right in front of me knowing that they were as fresh as could be. They were huge and extremely tasty. I had to wait awhile to eat because the food was so hot. 11 minutes passed between placing my order and picking up my food.  All orders come with two sauces. The southwest ranch seemed to lack flavor. The curry mango was fabulous! Be sure to ask for covers for your sauces because you will want to take home the leftovers.   The British decoration in the restaurant is perfect for the theme. It has a very, very small interior with little indoor seating. Fish and chips from Gordon Ramsay's shop would be great for eating while walking along the Las Vegas Strip.",

    "text": "I've been enjoying excellent Fish & Chips since childhood...having been British educated and lived in Australia, I used to get them wrapped in newspaper.....the way it was done in the old days.....and I absolutely loved it! Then, trying to decide what to have fir lunch today, Gordon's Fish & Chips place popped up on yelp so I figured.....heck with my healthy eating, I'm in Vegas!....and proceeded to walk all the way here in the 106 degree dry heat to get a taste.  Located along the promenade next to The LINQ, it's very easy to spot as there aren't too many British flags and red telephone booth frontages in the whole of the USA, I would think. So in I popped and there was a line....very typical fast food concept....get in the line, decide what you want to order, watch the open kitchen cooks churning out the freshly fried chips (ok, fries in the US) and fish, etc. Then once you get to the order/cashier counter you place your order.....it may be a good idea to decide beforehand whether you want to upgrade the \"dirty\" flavors of your fries to one of the three choices on the board for an extra $2...otherwise you'll just get regular sea salt by default.....as well as choose 2 of the 5 available dipping sauces also on the board. If you don't know which ones you want beforehand the order/cashier lady may get a bit impatient and annoyed with you for holding up the line.....probably trained by Gordon himself.  Anyway, I ordered the Fish & Chip combo, added Dirty sauce #2 - Truffle, Parmesan, Chives to my chips.....and the Curry and Mango and Gordon's Tartar Sauce on the siide. The combos come with a fountain drink (actually, a touchscreen drinks machine)........condiments and plastic utensils located right next to the drinks machine.   I will say that, based on my long time love of fish & chips, this is perhaps one of the best batter fried fish I have ever had. The batter was not too light and not too heavy....just perfect.... and the white fish so fresh, smooth, and flaky. What really tops it all off were the side sauces. As much as I would have liked to go old school traditional and had it with vinegar, ketchup, and tartar sauce. But the sides I chose were different and still yummy nonetheless.  Ok, now for the chips......not my fave. I don't remember English chips having such a thick and chewy outside. The old chips of London and Australia I'm used to had a very thin, light, and crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy potato on the inside.....there was hardly any soft and fluffy potato on the inside. I ate my chips hoping that it may have been just a few and things would get better, but I quit after having finished just a third of it since I really didn't enjoy them very much. Yea yea yea, if Gordon found out about what I just said, I'm sure he'd be sharing another \"F\" word with me.  There's very limited seating here....kind of like a nice hold in the wall fish & chip joint....mostly counter seating with some just outside. Service as can be expected with a fast food takeaway place.",

The fish was very light and flakey and the chips aka fries had a good taste to them too. I thought the overall price and quantity of food was well worth it.   This location is small so there is very limited seating available. The overall atmosphere is casual. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they call your # out when the order is ready. I was pleasantly surprised with how fast the orders came out.   I would recommend a stop in next time you're looking to get your fish and chips fix in Las Vegas.",

We ordered the lobster and shrimp, fish and chips and the sticky toffee pudding pops. The cod was beautiful, flaky, tender and fried perfectly. The lobster was sweet, tender and juicy and the sticky toffee pops might just be the best dessert I've ever eaten and I'm an avid baker and foodie! Now on to the staff, I'm allergic to nightshade ( which even in 4 star restaurants it's hard to find anyone who knows what nightshade is ) the man and woman working not only knew exactly what it was, they patiently guided me through the menu and explained what I could and couldn't eat. Their patience and knowledge was very much appreciated and my dining experience went exactly to plan. I didn't feel left out at all! The prices were actually cheaper than a 12 inch sub sandwich at the hotel we're staying at or any run of the mill buffet, which was shocking! Thank you Gordon and staff for a fantastic experience. If you're in Las Vegas it's a stop worth making!",

    "text": "I made it a goal to visit at least one Gordon Ramsay establishment while I was in town.  We debated to visit his steakhouse but we decided on another restaurant instead so I was ecstatic to find out he had a fish & chips eatery.  I ordered a plate of fish and chips and my fiance ordered the shrimp and chips (she really likes shrimp) and the food quite honestly met all of my expectations.  Texture, flavor, size, it hit everything with flying colors however the real highlight was the shrimp.  I don't know if it was the seasoning on the shrimp (or perhaps Gordon Ramsay hand catches them in the ocean and decides whether or not they are worthy enough to be served in his restaurant) but it was amazing.  I had to steal a few from my fiance as she was eating.  The shrimp are huge and battered just right to not take away from the shrimp.  A definite must stop for a lunch break.",

The menu is easy to navigate with the help of the friendly young lady taking my order. I was torn between the Biscoff and the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shakes. Before taking my order she was kind enough to give me a sample. Both were equally heavenly but I went with the Biscoff which was sweeter than the Sticky Toffee Pudding. On to the dipping sauces you have five choices I chose the obvious tarter sauce and the curry mango. The sauces were a flavorful compliment to the crispy, flakey and deliciously battered fish. If you're looking for a quick snack that doesn't disappoint on the strip this is a great escape. Try to get there during an off peak time because there isn't a lot of seating.",

I was told that they use Alaskan Cod.  It was so fresh and so well done.  The flavors were wonderful.  The french fries (chips) were made just I remember them in London, probably better.

There was not only fish options either, they had shrimp, chicken or sausage options as well.  The fish was delicious and flakey. My husband has problems with grease upsetting his stomach and this was the usual reaction he has so I would skip it if grease is a problem for you but otherwise I would recommend this spot. My only bad thought was that there was no regular lemonade. It was either orange juice lemonade or ginger lemonade. My husband got the orange and it tasted like bad orange juice. They also didn't have malt vinegar for the fish, maybe that's not a thing in Great Britain but it would have been amazing to have. Overall though it was a great meal!",

My wife had the chicken and chips, which were equally as great. With a choice of two dipping sauces per combo, there's no limit to the flavor combinations you can create.

Sauces I chose (I should have stuck to ketchup) made me feel a bit sick. Not much fish in the batter.

    "text": "The food was yummy and presentation was fast and easy .  Staff was very accommodating and we got exactly what we ordered.  Loved the flakiness of the fish and the crispness of the chips.  Very busy so plan for a wait.  Also needed attention to tidiness of surroundings.  Pile of ice had accumulated on soda machine, trash was overflowing onto floor and several spills needed to be cleaned.  Aroma inside was a bit overpowering, an oily, hot smell but not a burnt odor.  We would return keeping these thoughts in mind.",

    "text": "Cute little restaurant located in the Linq shopping center. Was skeptical at first because didn't want to pay $15 for fish and chips. The decor of the restaurant was cute and you get to watch the chefs make the fish and chips. You get three large pieces of fish and basket of fries for $14.99 and you can upgrade the fries to \"dirty\" fries for $2. We upgraded our hand cut fries for the truffle and parmesan fries. SO GOOD. the fish had a light airy batter, moist,and was not greasy at all! Fries were airy and crispy with the perfect amount of seasoning. The sauces are also delicious; combo comes with 2 sauces. We choose the southwest ranch and tarter sauce. Bf and I shared one combo and it filled us up. Would definitely come back to try other combos when we are in town!",
