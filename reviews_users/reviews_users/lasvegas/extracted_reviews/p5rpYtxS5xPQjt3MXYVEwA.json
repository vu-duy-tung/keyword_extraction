The main reason got bumped up to five star! I have been the other location on my side of town. Wow! The food am sure just as good (on this visit only came in for recovery smoothie aka went with Green Leaf Berry Blast) as the other location. I have always been fan of with the healthy choices. The prices can be pricey but in this case your getting the quality you pay for and they have nice diversity of options. The WOW factor for me. The interior design was SOOOOO much more pleasant then the other location. Maybe its because I believe this is the mother ship or the first one in Vegas. So the interior design is totally pimped out with personality and makes you want too come back rather then the bland blah interior of the other location. Here so many things that stands out soon as walked in. The fake waterfall coming down on the wall, the green chairs, couple wide screens places next to the waterfalls, and everywhere look love the interior design. The fountain area with the cucumber water dispenser adds nice touch then your normal fountain station area. The customer service is fabulous. I jus wished they could have flip flop the interior design to the one closer my side of town then I would be duke. Lol!",

The menu offers so many choices and combinations that it is refreshing not to beg for menu accommodations. 2nd, I am calorie conscious so I like that there were so many excellent healthy options that were appealing. 3rd The menu covers selections from raw to meat therefore everyone is happy, and no one compromises. 4th The prices are great, you can keep it low and not have to eat a side salad. 5th I saw the cucumber lemon water and found out that was free! 6th, I loved my choice! I decided to have the frittata with turkey and fontina cheese and it was delicious. It was served with a salad with watermelon. The portion was generous and  I cant wait to return again. 7th I was so happy to have a reuseable plastic plate and silverware which is nice not to eat off of paper etc...  As far  as ambiance, it is all open air, it is very casual. There are  flat scrrenTV's with a variety of shows.  We enjoyed sitting outside, there is a parking lot  so keep in mind it is casual",

Made with no sugar added Acai sorbet, fresh pineapple, assorted berries, banana, & crunchy granola. As I was in line, I overheard Tyler (the cashier) informing the woman in front of me that they now have a kids menu as well & that they are healthier but fun kids options, like house made peanut butter & no sugar jelly. The little girl seemed to like it. The service here has always be great but I was pleasantly surprised on how upbeat & knowledgable Tyler was.  It seems that whatever flaws this place, I think it is because they try to make everyone happy, by preparing items that are not even on the menu.",

After my work out, I was starving, and despite the Saturday afternoon crowds in the shopping center I figured from what i heard It should be worth it.   When I opened the door it put me immediately in line.  It wasn't as long of a wait as I thought it would be.  I ordered my food to go and took time to really check this place out while I waited.   The place was packed, looked like there was plenty of seating (Inside & out)  I loved the earthy vibe with bright green chairs. I took a better look at the menu and noticed they also cater to those crazy RAW and HCG dieters which was pretty cool.   As I waited for my summer berry salad and antioxidant smoothie, I was so pissed I didn't order the ostrich burger I was originally thinking about. (Damn it, I always tell myself to go with my gut, or first pick) It looked so good. From what i could see they cook just about everything in their brick oven.   The manager or owner noticed me being nosy, and made a joke, I told him it was my first time, and couldn't help it!  He was really nice, asked my name and told me my order was coming shortly. When my salad was ready he told me that put my chicken in a separate container so it wouldn't wilt my spinach.  Crazy nice!   Every dish I saw looked great. Can't wait for that ostrich burger.",

Our party of two walked in the door, there was no one in line, yet no one greeted us or asked if we had any questions. After looking at the menu I ordered a breakfast burrito with turkey sausage and my partner had a Greek egg whites omelette. The flavor of the food was nonexistent. It is very rare for us not to finish our food when we go out to eat, but this is an exception for us. The cheese on the burrito was not cooked, tasted awful, and they forgot the feta cheese in my partners omelette! When the server finally brought us our food outside, she forgot forks and napkins. She told me I need to go inside to get those and did not offer any assistance or ask how our meal was. We will definitely not return, and will recommend that our friends and family try somewhere else when they are in Vegas! The Decour inside was very nice, we liked the water fountains have a laid-back atmosphere, but the food and the service was absolutely horrible.",

I ordered a burger with jicama fries and my husband ordered a wrap with tofu fries. Before coming here, we heard such great reviews of this place. To be completely honest, I wasn't really impressed. The food lacked flavor to me. My husband enjoyed it because he felt it was a healthy meal compared to the stuff we usually eat. I told him that healthy food can also taste good. He recently went back and had a turkey burger and said it tasted dry. There is a place a couple blocks from here called Elixer Organic Cafe that I think is much tastier. I might consider returning here to try something different one day before completely ruling it out.",

It's insane they make tofu and kale taste good  It's an ok location, centrally But parking is a b**** in the afternoon  I get the wellness shake every time All your fruits and veg are in there  They do steak, bison, cod, salmon and stuff for proteins I wish they had Sea bass I'd be there 14 times a week  Some people think it's expensive  Yeah kind of, but it's worth it. Because I like to see cooks preparing my food, I like the calorie count on display.   Staff is friendly, the tables and floors and utensils are always clean, and the bathroom is never gross.   I love this place I wish there were more.  I wish they were open 24/7 cause of the gym and Starbucks and tanning salon is, that's the only bad thing.  *****Update: My neighbor in Lake Las Vegas is a world renowned Chef and restauranteur with two 3 Star Michelin Awards. Very well known with cookbooks and his products are sold in Williams Sonoma.  I took him here for a quick wellness shake, he enjoyed it.  Recently, I brought him in for a quick bite, and the restaurant was about 5% full.   He ordered a pizza or flatbread, and I asked him to try my multigrain pancakes.  He said no.  I urged him repeatedly.  He finally tried it and said \"my God ... Are you kidding me??? Agave nectar instead of syrup?\"   It exceeded his expectations. And looked around the place, he said \"this is a good thing going on in here\"  One bite turned into half my plate.   He asked who the owner of the restaurant was, but I didn't see him. He likes to introduce himself when we are out and he is impressed.   Those pancakes made a great impression on a French Gourmet chef.  I urge a side of the if you come in the morning...  I haven't had anything I didn't like.  But also haven't tried the whole menu, being a creature of habit.   Spa water is available for free, they even carry the quest bars, and sometimes the Man Bake peanut butter cookies.   I have to diet or I will look like a meat ball.  But when I eat here, it's not bland diet food. So I actually enjoy it, and I love meeting other people who like this place too.   They have I think 3 now, I've only visited 2.",

Well, the beef was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but my complaint is with the Cabbage. Bib lettuce is typically what restaurants use for that crispness and clean bite. The cabbage was well...flavorless and hard to eat. Every bite I had to pull and strands from the ribs of the Cabbage would get stuck in my teeth as well as not being able to be bitten off cleanly. The cabbage made an otherwise great breadless burger kinda ick.  The sweet potato fries were awesome and tasty.  I will definitely come back to this location but I may need to bring my own lettuce to eat with it since the Cabbage has got to go.",

The different texture is very appealing to the palate.  The Malibu breeze smoothie is a great complement with this salad.  A blend of green grapes, pineapple, carrots, and oranges.",

I can't wait to venture here again to sample some more yummy goodness!!",

They have a full juice/smoothie bar (peanut butter/banana/chocolate smooth is phenomenal), grill, and healthy treat options.    My favorite meal to order here is the bison cheesesteak.  The Bison is wrapped in a spinach wrap with melted cheese, peppers, and some type of chipotle sauce mixed in.   The bison burger is also delicious.  It is much leaner than beef burgers so it's not as juicy, but they do well at making it very flavorful.",

    "text": "Extra! Extra! Read All About It!  You're a wise man or woman, if you read some of the reviews of Greens and Proteins before trying them out.  You'll find a mix of \"I've experienced better\", \"A-Ok\", and \"As good as it gets\".  The most common issue...the sticker shock.  Yup, Greens and Proteins is on the Richie Rich side for what you get in quantity.  Smoothies over $10 (not lying), sandwiches over $12 (no five-dollar foot long here), and even their burgers are pricey starting around $10 (Where's the beef?).  I read the reviews and was armed with knowledge before I step foot in here. So, why the 5 Stars from me?   It comes to down to what I think Greens and Proteins was trying to accomplish, eating on the healthier side.  One thing about eating healthier, it sure cost more and I knew that coming in.  5 Stars because I expected less and got more.    I came here for their Proteins, not the Greens, and decided on the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\".  This is a 4 Step process, but I only chose Step 1, which was protein only.   You have a choice of Filet Mignon ($17), Bison ($13), Chicken ($10), Turkey ($9), Salmon ($13), and even my favorite lean meat Ostrich ($17).  I got the salmon and they knocked a few bucks off the price because I didn't get anything else with it.  The salmon is about 6 oz and to be honest, it was a little bland.  I solved this by adding a little Teriyaki sauce to it.  Voila! Problem solved.   As for the restaurant and ambiance, it's just okay.  You get a mix of your Average Joes, Fitness Freaks, and New Year Resolutioners.  My favorite is the guy wearing a tank top, beanie, and sunglasses.  Guess this guy is just confused whether it's hot ,cold, or sunny inside.  Or, he's just too cool for the rest of us.  The wait is little longer than expected and since the restaurant is also small, it gets a little loud and crowded.  Overall, I am a fan and think Greens and Protein is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and tasty, then Greens and Proteins may not be for you.  If you're looking for something clean, healthier, and don't mind spending a little more, then Greens and Proteins is perfect.",

Luckily, I was a couple miles away. When I got there, there was a bunch of people outside. I walked into a half empty restaurant. Plenty of places for ya'll to sit! The cashier was okay, not that friendly or memorable. It always enjoy nice service.  Got my food to go and I was stoked. The cheesesteak wrap looked just like the picture, and was pretty huge. But, alas not everything is what you expect it to be. It felt kind of dry. The wrap was definitely lacking. I was a bit disappointed I bothered to take the drive and took the time to get lost -_- The tofu fries, another let down. I know tofu isn't very flavorful, but these fries looked like they should have tasted better than they did. It had a bunch of red powder, but I guess that was just decoration.  I would forsure want to try something else here though because I feel like I just ordered the wrong thing.",

One highlight of the menu here is the option to build your meal to your specs, starting with your greens, protein, grains, and choice of sauce - All of the components for a full and balanced meal, with you knowing everything that went into it.  For my order, I went with a vegan burger, topped with avocado (costs extra), and a side of tofu fries. The burger was delicious and flavored to perfection. The baked tofu fries were insanely good too. I left the restaurant wishing that more places offered this as a side. Don't fret, carnivores. There are plenty of great meat options for you too.  If you're looking for a casual stop for a bite to eat, without the worry of having to loosen your belt a few notches after. Greens and Proteins is the right place to be. I just wish there were more places like this around the valley for the more health conscious eater.",

They have an amazing menu of healthy items suited for any diet from Atkins to HCG. G&P has it covered.  On my first visit I ate their Crab and Avocado lettuce cups. It was very tasty and healthy. The lettuce cups came loaded with real crab! Definitely worth the $9.99 price tag. I also had their Wellness Drink! Let me tell you I am totally in love with their Wellness Drink (minus the pineapple cause i'm allergic). It only has 286 calories and  tastes amazing. I love the green grapes and the fact that they use agave nectar is perfect for my diabetes!!!   On my next couple visits I ordered the Wellness Drink of course, but I brought my husband so I could try his drinks too! He tried the Apple Pie Smoothie. It totally tasted like apple pie! The one he got the other day though is almost as good as the Wellness drink ,but it's called the Tofu Banana Split! YUMMY! You can't taste the squash or any veggies that are in it. I recommend this one for your pickie eaters!  Greens and Proteins has a nice friendly staff and they are pretty knowledgeable about the food. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it to me. I can't wait to go back to try some of their other food items, but I'll be back every chance I get for that Wellness drink!",

The patty was really soggy. The texture was just weird and unlike any GOOD veggie burger I've had before. The tofu fries were OKAY. They were really crunchy on the outside but inside, it tasted like a soft scramble of egg whites. I don't think mine were cooked enough. & there were only 6 fries. SIX. Maybe if I had 10, I would've ate enough to have the same result as most reviewers.    The experience didn't kill my hope in Greens & Proteins. I just won't ever have a burger there again. But I definitely will give their shakes a chance. They looked amazing!!",

There were a lot of seeds and kind of got irritating after a while.  A friend of mine had the wellness drink so I tried that too.  I found that it was more of my \"speed.\"  Lots of greens and grass, etc.    What I really appreciate is that this place is clean.  The colors are simple and crisp.

I also enjoyed looking around at their cute outdoor interior and exterior decor feel with their unique looking glossy lumber block tables. They have a huge variety of food items from vegan options, create your own meal, and  several different ingredients of lettuce, vegetables, herbs, meats offered from dish to dish.  I guess on the down side (not that it's a bad thing) the wide selection of menu options can seem a bit overwhelming.  I ordered the wellness drink with extra pineapples.  The drink was good, however a little on the watery side (maybe from extra pineapple and it being a smoothie and not a fresh squeezed juiced drink).  I also ordered the harvest kale stocked salad which I highly recommend to anyone who likes a lot of flavor and fruit in your salad.  I'm not a big salad person but the staff recommended this particular salad as his personal favorite and I was so glad he did because it did not disappoint!  We also ordered the salmon ceviche which was ok, however in my opinion lacked heat (I like spicier foods) guess I should've added hot sauce.  I love ceviche but probably won't get this again.",

    "text": "I made the mistake of coming in during the lunch rush. It was my intent to treat a colleague with very specific tastes to lunch. When we arrived, the line was twelve people deep, so our assumption was the food was worth the wait.  As we waited we noticed the manager or owner take a person out of line and personally take and expedite her order. At first, I thought he was trying to speed service. The woman in front of us commented, \"if I were in tight spandex maybe I'd skip to the front of the line too.\" Sure enough, the helpful employee did not take anyone else out of line to take their order and stayed chatting with the young woman until her smoothie came.  Meanwhile, my associate noted prices were higher than she really wanted to pay for a smoothie or lunch. Since we were already waiting and the lunch hour was winding away, I reminded her I was treating.  Adventurous, I ordered the ostrich burger with tofu fries. My companion ordered a smoothie and a make your own meal with salmon and rice. By the time we paid, the helpful manager had long since seen his prey leave with her smoothie and was sitting alone at her table on his phone texting or maybe yelping.   We waited to take our food to go. As we waited, we both cringed hearing the cook at the grill sneezing. This is incidental as I'm sure he was sanitary about the sneeze, but it's still not something you want to hear as your food's being prepared, and it bolstered a so far unsatisfactory experience.  We eventually received our order and rushed back to our office to eat.  My coworker's first comment in the car? \"This smoothie is terrible. I can get a better one a Whole Foods for half the price.\"   We waited till the office to start in on the rest. My ostrich burger wasn't bad. This was my second ostrich burger ever and it ranked top two. The tofu fries were actually pretty tasty.   Unfortunately, my coworker's meal wasn't as tasty. Already unhappy with the smoothie she asked me to taste her rice. The rice was still uncooked. The fish on the other hand was overcooked. For the rest of the day all I heard her say was, \"that smoothie was not worth nine dollars\" and \"how hard is it to cook rice?\"",

It's a cute place with nice, fresh decorations! The cashiers were really nice and easy to talk to - they explained thoroughly any foods and drinks I had questions about. Though it is pricey, the quality of the food does show.  I got the summer berry salad, which consists of berries, spinach, goat cheese, and raspberry vinaigrette. The ingredients were really fresh! Some of the berries are REALLY sweet by themselves, but the taste can be easily toned down if you eat the spinach and goat cheese with it in one bite. The contents of the salad worked harmoniously with themselves!  I also got the white chocolate veggiechino, which is their healthier version of the frappucino. I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no! It was pleasantly sweet, even with all the greens they put in there. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks frappucinos at all, which was very nice.  Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again. Maybe next time I'll try the Thai peanut chicken satays.",

    "text": "Ordered the Bison Burger to go. Definitely an interesting healthy menu I'd like to come try again, especially the Ostrich Burger, even though it's pretty heavy on your wallet, $14.99. But I heard ostrich is pricey.  Jicama fries that comes with the burgers are very interesting. Not french fries, far from it. It's more like seasoned radish slices. That's definitely a healthy substitute... definitely not as yummy as french fries. A+ for effort, though. Many items for people who are on that HCG diet, too.  Free Wi-Fi inside and the decor is very modern and hip. The place looked very clean and orderly. There were lots of take-out orders going out, so lots of people seem to like this place. Always a good sign...  I'll definitely come back here. I think you get a check-in discount on their smoothies, so I'll come back for those and more healthy eats!",

This place is for the health conscious, the clean eaters, the non-meat eaters, the type of people who shop at Whole Foods, and the crowd that hits the gym. It's that type of vibe, if you get what I'm saying.  I like to come here when I'm trying (emphasis on the trying) to be healthy, but I still crave convenience. And I love eating out and eating healthy without always having to settle for a salad (but they have that here too if that's what you're into). Here's the lowdown:  THE GOOD: + Healthy + Convenient + Good quality ingredients + Good portions for decent prices + Vegan and Vegetarian options  THE BAD: - Need to salt your own food  I get /why/ they don't salt their food, I just don't /like/ that I have to do it myself. Buying an under seasoned meal just doesn't sit well with me.  Overall, I recommend this place. You could make a lot of the food here if you had the time, but I think what you're really paying for is fast, convenient, and healthy food. And I think most days it's worth it, even if you have to salt it yourself.",

I didn't. The order was specifically for delivery, \"powered by GrubHub\". I've NEVER ordered takeout, and have NEVER toggled the \"take out\" feature upon order placement.   The customer service gal didn't do anything to help. She said she would call the restaurant. \"What are they going to do?!\" I asked. \"The food has been ready for an hour-they fulfilled their part of the order process.\"  So now my question is this: how the HELL do I Yelp, Yelp? Because in this instance YELP DROPPED THE BALL IN EPIC FASHION and I have no recourse but to poorly rate a restaurant that I love in an attempt to hold Yelp/GrubHub accountable?

I went there once after taking an exam because I needed some fuel and ended up staying there to grade some papers while eating and sipping on some cucumber water (they do have wifi or you can use the Starbucks wifi next door!) and another couple times with friends and family.

Haha this location is right next to Starbucks but I've been trying to eat healthier so I decided to give it a try.   The line was really long. Almost out the door. I had to kind of stand off to the side because it was so busy. The staff was extremely nice. Their menu items are listed as well as the calorie count so that is much appreciated. I decided to try the acai berry smoothie (acai, green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple, coconut, beet powder, spinach, kale, honey, banana, and peaches). Yum!   The smoothie took awhile to make but it was delicious and very filling for me. I also decided on the low carb Caesar salad.  I actually really disliked this salad. Not recommended. Maybe it was the Parmesan crisps on the top or the EVOO caesar dressing but I didn't like the way it tasted at all. However the decor is very beautiful, vibrant green chairs and they have real plants, along with 2 waterfalls against the back walls. Beautiful and relaxing!   Pros: beautiful decor, friendly staff, free wifi, nice outside patio seating as an option, complimentary cucumber water, tv's along the wall   Cons: hard to find parking, long lines sometimes out the door   Would I go back? Yes! Next time I would love to try their ahi protein salad and the chocolate peanut butter banana shake!   Tip*** I checked in with Yelp and received $1 off my smoothie",

Greens and Proteins caters to those that are calorie-conscious, macro-conscious, protein-conscious, those who didn't meal prep, and anybody who's just finding out that eating healthy doesn't have to taste like cardboard.  They have smoothies, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, acai bowl, tofu fries, jicama fries, customizable meals, protein cookies and baked goodies. They have a variety of protein sources for carnivores and vegetarians: ostrich, bison, chicken, ahi tuna, steak, tofu, etc. They have grains and veggies. And I must say, I love how they cook their tofu - it's warm, lightly crisp and flavorful.  My favorites include the bison burger with tofu fries, ahi tuna salad, acai berry smoothie, and my custom combo (ahi tuna with broccoli or asparagus, brown rice and pesto).  The calorie info is displayed on their menu. Food does not have to be laden with fat, salt and sugar to taste good.",

I usually grab a cup of their coffee here...it's pretty good.   They are open until 10pm. So if you are a late eater, you can come here. There is sitting outside.   My most recent meal that I can remember (I've been here more than a handful of times) was their scrambled egg whites with turkey sausage and tofu. Surprisingly, the tofu was good...and this is coming from a person who doesn't eat tofu. I also had their acai bowl which I enjoyed.   One of my favorite places. Enjoy it!",

However, my wife and I were out looking for a place to grab something that fit my dietary needs and it came down to Protein House or Greens and Proteins. We went into Protein House and looked at their menu but nothing jumped out to us. Further, I didn't like that they don't have macronutrient  information on their menu at Protein House.   So we headed to Greens and Proteins and were pleased as always. Prepared how I would prepare it at home but it's cooked by someone else so it's better! . The food really is delicious so I highly recommend that if you haven't been there, you go!",

    "text": "I love to see what people can do in the health food/vegan food industry and I've been blessed to try a lot of establishments that take the idea that healthy food can be delicious to the next level! That being said, I really wanted to love Greens and Proteins, but after ordering from them twice I'm feeling pretty lukewarm about them. Heres why.  The roasted vegetable wrap: Ok, good assortment of veggies in here but VERY VERY greasy. So greasy that it was inedible the next day. Even though it has some pesto in there it REALLY lacks flavor. I think they need to pair it with some kind of creamy dipping sauce, put some seasoning on those veggies, and for the love of god: tone down the oil! Then it would be perfect.  Hummus platter: Very unimpressive and tastes unusual? The hummus was very gritty and dry and has a flavor unlike any hummus I've had before (and I've had a lot of hummus!). A decent hummus is extremely easy to make so I'm really not sure what happened here *shrug*  Fries: Their options are tofu fries, jicama fries, and sweet potato fries for extra $. I'm sorry, but the only sensible option here seems to be the sweet potato fries. I could be wrong but the other two options just sounded bizarre. So I ordered the sweet potato fries twice. The first time I just tossed them out because they were so bland and under cooked. However, the second time somebody in the kitchen wisened up and crisped those guys up and added a bit of salt. Ate the whole thing! Yum.  Ahi Tuna Salad: I got without the hard boiled egg. Probably the best thing I ordered. Pretty straightforward. Kudos.  Wellness Juice: Excellent. I love the large size, flavor, and it was definitely fresh!  So yeah, being that I have a lot of dietary restrictions I was pretty much limited to only a few items + plus the juices/smoothies. Which is fine, as long as they are delicious and prepared correctly. Clearly there need to be some improvements! I hope Greens and Proteins reads this!",

There is always a nice selection of fresh foods and of course the juices! Amazing!! The portion sizes are not something that you would find a claim jumper, thank God, there just right for the average person that's looking for something healthy. The parking here is super super simple and easy to get in and out of. The staff here is really helpful to help you find anything that you need. Your food is ready and usually less than five minutes and it's hot and delicious. If you're looking for someplace that's not deep-fried and not slathered in sauces, come here you won't be disappointed. The reason for the four stars instead of the five is that I think their dining area could use a little bit more revamping. The ambience is fine but the chairs and tables are kind of cheap and flimsy. Not something I prefer to sit on so I usually get takeout. Either way eating there or taking out you're going to be happy!",

We originally were going to the sunrise cafe next door but they had a long wait and the place was packed so we decided to try this place out.   The layout is not bad and it has a clean feel. They have a good selection on the menu. Customer service was not bad but not that great either. The girl at the counter wasn't too friendly but wasn't rude either.   I decided to have the breakfast burrito and my girlfriend ordered the Acai bowl.   The burrito was pretty good. Not too big but enough to be filling. I was not a fan of the  tofu potatoes that came on the side. But that's not a deal breaker.  Here is the part that knocks off a couple stars. The acai bowl was almost completely frozen still. It had possibly the worst texture and consistency I've seen in an acai bowl. It was topped with granola and fruit which is nice but no honey or agave which left a lot of flavor to be desired. If I'm going to pay 8$ for a bowl, at least make sure to take the time to finish blending the acai instead of sending the bowl out half frozen.   So this place isn't terrible but could use some friendlier customer service, and I recommend shying away from the acai bowl.",

Decided to stop by after hitting the gym and was not disappointed at the quality of the wood. G&P puts a healthy spin on a lot of popular dishes: burgers (available in beef, ostrich, turkey or veggie), pizzas, sandwiches, salads and a huge assortment of smoothies and health drinks. The food is delicious, the BBQ chicken or Greek pizzas are a sizable portion yet unbelievably low in calories. G&P is one of the few places nearby to get fresh squeezed juices, and their parfaits are awesome.  The downside is that Greens is a bit overpriced. During my last trip I opted to get a chicken Teriyaki wrap and at $11 I thought it was very overpriced. I guess this what you can charge for healthy food when you are right across the street for a LVAC. Staff and service is fine for an eatery of this size. Greens and Proteins is definitely worth checking out as one of the few clean eating spots in town.",

Greens and Proteins has burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches, smoothies, juices, etc! There are so many options!   I ordered the Veggie Burger and Crispy Tofu. It was by far one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had. It could have been the cashews added to the burger, but it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It made you feel good about eating it. The avocado, lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and hit the spot. The crispy tofu was delicious too. I want to try the jicama fries next time!

At the time of this review, you still get $1 off a smoothie when you check in on Yelp, so put your app to work! They have a wonderful ginger concoction, but on our last visit we went with the Wellness Drink, and it was a mean green delicious machine. It is worth stopping in just for a quality beverage.   As for the eats, one of my favorite treats here are the tofu fries. I realize they may sound like a disgrace to the original almighty french fry, but as a french fry lover, I am here to say if you like tofu, you will love these. They are perfectly proportioned and lightly seasoned. Do they taste like a french fry, no? But, they do taste like you want to eat another and another and another...   My husband has ordered the bison wrap twice, and on my last visit, I went with a \"Build Your Own Meal\" combo. You get a choice of a protein, a vegetable, a grain and a sauce. I had turkey breast, mixed green salad, and cous cous with a balsamic reduction. I ate every last bite and didn't feel guilty. I love that you can get a complete meal that is healthy and affordable without all of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with a full service restaurant. (Greens is a counter service spot where you take a number.)  They also offer healthy pizzas and options for vegetarians and vegans. However, don't be fooled, it isn't a vegan restaurant. There is plenty o' meat!",

This wasn't the best place to come for hangover food but I'm sad I waited so long to try this place out! Really unique menu items and good for a gal that's watching what she eats as everything has the calorie count and I think most menu items are only in the 300 calorie range. Things coming out were pretty fast but I have to come back again to try a green smoothie here! Check in on Yelp and I think you can get $1 off any smoothie.",

    "text": "CRAZY ROID RAGE customer was RUDE to me. Owners need to give him the heeve ho!!! I'll explain more later and how the amazing girl Savannah professionally put him in his place.   First the food: I've never really eaten in this restaurant but my HCG diet told me about their amazing prepared meals they have Which are 10$ and weigh out the 4 ounces of meat with 2 cups of acceptable veggies. So good!!!   ROID RAGE guy... So there was a crazy roid rage maniac who interrupted me as I was paying for my 4 meals to go... He said, \"ummm.. Scuse me miss.. I'm in a hurry and trying to pay and get out of here. So if you don't mind..\" Then he proceeds to try and cut me...by stepping in front of me... You can tell he worked out but was super Aggro. Angry and very rude. Then he was rude to Savannah... The sweet lady checking us out. He did this AS I was paying... The amazing cashier Savannah stepped in and quickly put him in his place. Then....  HE TRIED to start a FIGHT!:: Then he started to try and start a fight with me and my BF as he was leaving. Saying, \"fuck you\" and motioning for us to go outside to 'fight' him... Let me repeat this interaction above was ALL that happened. It was so bizarre. I said why is he so angry?? Then I asked the cashier and all of the employees said he's rude every day...   It got me to thinking. Although my BF and I ended up paying close to 70$ before we left.. Maybe more.. (because we ordered food for lunch and dinner tomorrow)... And I will probably eat the majority of my next months meals here... Even if this guy is a customer EVERY day.. He should NOT be allowed to be in here and wreck our experience. His rudeness was all my BF and I spoke about all dinner. I hope the owners read this and although my food and experience with the workers here has been great.. They should rectify this situation by banning this guy because I really am dreading have to run into him again... It's giving me anxiety about coming in.. And if every employee knows him I'm sure if they read this they will know exactly who I am talking about.   Other than that guy... My experience here is amazing. I've lived in LA forever and they really GET this whole healthy living lifestyle thing. I commend them, LOVE this restaurant and will recommend this to anyone. I now have my BF hooked. I also wish there was a reward program as I've now gotten about 7 HCG meals and will keep coming. Such a great restaurant. Great job GREENS & PROTEINS!!!",

I didn't even go in at peak times, I went in well after normal dinner hours. The next time I went the food just wasn't good. I know it can be hard to make healthy food taste good, but those jicama fries are just bad. The burger I had was okay but overpriced for what I got. Yesterday I went to get a smoothie after a workout. I thought they had specific protein smoothies but they don't, which kind of shocks me since they're so close to a gym. I got the veggichino drink and added protein which ended up making the drink come out to like $8...so not worth it. The drink is green and weird and has like chunks of coffee bean in it. And the woman making the drink made too much so she gave me my normal smoothie AND another cup with the rest of the smoothie...normally I'd be ok with that but I'm trying to watch my caloric intake since I started working out so giving me extra really doesn't help lol. I've given them a couple of chances but I really don't feel compelled to go back and try anything else.",

    "text": "Whenever I have to be in Henderson (typically for work reasons), I try to make a stop by Greens and Proteins. Why? Mostly because it is healthy food, and I need to eat better most of the time.  That being said, Greens and Proteins, while expensive, is worth it. I'm not saying I'd be dropping money here every week, but it is a splurge for a quick bite (or just a smoothie). Thus far I have had two of their smoothies, my favorite of the two being the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake: Cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This produces a smooth, yet thick smoothie I really enjoy.  I've also had the Green Leaf Berry Blast: Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, lemon, carrots, cabbage, spinach, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Not as good as the Peanut Butter Banana taste-wise, and the texture is much more watery. However, all those berries, and vegetables - you know you are getting a powerful boost of nutrition.  Lastly, food-wise I have had their BBQ chicken pizza. It comes out on a thin crust with low-fat mozzarella, chicken, and red onions. It was recommended to me by the staff and I have to agree with them - it was delicious, crisp, not at all greasy, and delightful to be eating a pizza that isn't AS BAD for me as other pizzas.  Overall, I have no complaints about service or quality of food. The only thing is the big bite it takes out of your pocket book. Be prepared to spend upwards of $15-$20 if you want a meal and drink. For smoothies, the pricing is $7.50. It's not the cheapest, but when you are thinking of you health, isn't it priceless? Ha!",

It's always awesome too.   I've been here many times and usually get the green wellness drink but this time I tried the acai berry juice instead.  It was really good.  Very fruity but still with kale and spinach to make it a super smoothie in case you're counting calories and need  your fruit  and veggie fix. The wellness smoothie is also a great choice since it combines fresh fruit and veggies together for a blend that's really awesome as well. I think both are excellent choices.    For food I usually get the bbq chicken pizza because it's delicious and only 320 calories for the whole thing. That is nothing short of a miracle. How can something be so delicious and healthy at thethe Same  time? ? Boggles my mind but still keeps me coming back. I definitely recommend this  place to anyone looking to eat healthier but is having trouble making the switch. They make it so easy here.",

After a few minutes, War Beard approached my table and said \"the pizza is taking a little longer than expected. Would you like a complimentary drink while you wait?\"   To be honest it wasn't that long a wait (it's never a dull moment when you have a Smartphone!) but I said \"sure, what would you recommend?\" He said \"How about a Wellness drink?\" And I said, \"go for it!\"   Their Wellness drink is more of a juice than a smoothie and it's pretty darn good. Later I looked at the menu to see how much this complimentary drink normally costs - $7.50. That's not the cheapest drink around and yeah, lucky me, I got it comped, just because War Beard cares about his customers.   I guess the point I want to make is that War Beard - whether he's the manager or owner - really knows the meaning of Customer Satisfaction. I don't normally write reviews on Yelp, but the service at this Eastern/215 Greens and Proteins convinced me to spend a little time writing this review.",

Even when we re-placed our order (two orders of Thai ginger soup and a hot tea), it took at least 15 minutes to come out to us. Their whole setup looked chaotic. The soup was... weird. I get using ground cashews to make something 'creamy' with no dairy, but the texture ended up pasty and odd. It was also under seasoned. To be fair, other food orders I saw coming out looked tasty. Final gripe: the single choice for hot tea was chamomile. No other herbal or green selections (not to mention black), and I wasn't informed until after I'd ordered and paid. Really people? The place was busy and clean and bright, so there must be some appeal, just not in my one experience",

It wasn't as thick as some smoothie places make their smoothies and I was definitely happy about that!  It was the perfect flavor and consistency.  AND, it filled me up!  Now, I'm a hungry, hungry hippo, so I usually need a lot more than a smoothie to satisfy my hunger.  But not here!

It's one of several dining options within walking distance of LVAC and it's definitely our fav especially when we are faking it trying to eat nutritiously.  About the only thing we haven't tried are the various smoothies, shakes, veggie blends, etc.  Our fav item on the menu is the make your own meal - a protein, a veggie and a starch with a sauce.  The cost ranges from $9 to about $18.  I generally go for the pork loin or turkey ( the cheaper selections ) with the veggie choice of either mushroom, asparagus or spinach and the brown rice with the pesto sauce.  they have about 8 choices in each category.  Also like the tofu fries, the chicken fingers and the caesar salad.  The pizzas are also decent but suggest you ask them to make the crust crisp since at times i felt the crust was \" limp\"  Good service and they have a several flat screen TV's for sports watching.",

My eating habits range from ravenous 4 year old that skipped lunch, to bougie Michelin Star brat.   Anyway, I ordered via Uber Eats. The food came really fast and was still hot. I opted for my favorite veggie burger on the planet, the G&P Veggie Burger. It's a lentil black bean, brown rice, mushroom, celery, carrot, onion, cilantro, basil, garlic and cashew patty that's 10.99. It makes me forget about bacon. Although I'm not a fan of lentils, it's not \"lentily\"--we'll pretend that's a word. I ordered it with their tofu fries. The bun was flaky, fresh & soft, the burger was very flavorful & moist (ew I hate the word moist lol) and the fries were different but cool!   I love that they offer so many options for specialty diets. It makes it easier to order out for my kiddo. He got the Angus Burger on their gluten free bun with dairy free cheese. He loved it. It's hard enough dealing with severe allergies, places like G&P allows us not worry about allergen contaminations.   Overall great food, I'll be back!",

I always get the Build Your Own meal, which lets you customize your dish to include a protein, veggie, grain and sauce/dressing. I really like how you can choose two veggie items if you're not wanting the carb. The price varies based on which protein you choose, so it's usually between $10-$14 for that meal. The portions are generous, so I don't leave hungry.  When I'm not on a strict diet, I divulge in other menu items, the whole menu is delicious to me! I've heard some items are tasteless, guess I've been lucky :) Today I toted my mother along for brunch, and she enjoyed the Greek Pizza. Instead of tomato sauce they use the roasted pepper hummus, which tasted great with the cheese, cucumbers, and kalamata olives.  The price may be a little more than usual, but the quality in ingredients is worth it. This particular location is my favorite with the decor, and the staff is always friendly.",

I prefer to get my acai bowl here because unlike everywhere else, I can eat my bowl with everything and I'm not left with a whole bunch of the acai mix on the bottom without any toppings.

I totally dug the vegan pizza - lavash crust with plenty of Daiya plus roasted peppers, kalamata olives and basil.   I returned for a wellness shake (green veggies magically blended with ginger and other delicious items) that felt healthy but  tasted like a treat.  For lunch today, I tried the vegan burger with tofu fries.  I love these tofu fries!! They are actually more like vegan chikin fingers? nice-sized slabs of 'fu coated in a light batter, deep-fried and sprinkled w/ paprika.  I added a bit of salt and hot sauce, then they were perfect!  The burger comes on a whole wheat bun, but has no condiments.  They need some Vegenaise up in there, stat.  The burger was quite tasty and I left full and happy for ~$10 including tax and tip.  The juices are a bit pricy (~$7), but not so bad if you use them as a meal replacement.  Also you can check in on the Yelp app for iPhone and get $1 off juices and smoothies!  As a bonus for dine-in guests, they have DELICIOUS water. I'm not crazy! They make a sort of agua fresca with cucumbers and lemons, and it is damn good and so refreshing! Perfect for washing down your healthy items.",

    "text": "This healthy place is located in one of my favorite intersections in Las Vegas, 215 & Eastern!  I came here again after a workout session at the LVAC less than 100 yards away and it was busy as usual.  I'm glad the drink making station is immediately to the left when you walk in because they can make your drink while you wait in line.  I ordered the Wellness again, it's my personal favorite but you can't really go wrong with any of the drinks they have here.    Protip!:  A Yelp check in on your smart phone gives you $1 off towards a smoothie!  Every bit helps since the prices are high, but if you're a health nut then you'll know eating healthy is costly regardless.  For my protien I wanted the Ostrich but they were out of it this time so I settled for the Bison Burger without cheese.  They're both really good burgers and trying to find real Ostrich or Bison meat is difficult in Las Vegas, much less already prepared and ready to eat.  The tofu fries is really unique and good too!",

    "text": "Very impressed by the quality, taste, and portion size of their Bison wrap sandwich. (Excited to try the Ostrich wrap next time.) The Tofu Fries were a fun and tasty alternative to french fried potatoes. Again, really generous portion. Every juice and smoothie I've had has been really good - I would suggest asking the juice-maker on staff which one she/he recommends based on your likes and dislikes. They will suggest one and dial it in for you.   The food may be a dollar or two more than a comparable cafe-style restaurant, but you truly get it back in terms of portion size and quality. It takes one visit to realize this.  And, the staff actually looks healthy here. That says a lot!  Wish I lived closer. Will definitely eat here next time I'm at Eastern/215 for the Cars & Coffee car meetup on Saturdays.  FYI, there seem to be 'green' health cafe imitators popping up around the Valley. Try Greens and Proteins first - this place is the real deal. Greens and Proteins reminds me of R Thomas in Atlanta (a 24hr health food cafe) and that is a compliment.   Also, there is free Wi-fi here, and I noticed power outlets all along the back booths (like over 40 outlets in a row) so this would be a great alternative to a coffee shop if you need to hunker down and get some laptop work done.",

It's so cheesy and delicious and I love that it's made with bison instead of beef. The jicama fries are only so-so, and I don't do tofu so I would love to see them offer some more interesting sides, but I'm just being bratty..  The pizzas are yummy, low calorie, and relatively low carb.   A place where vegans, and low carb carnivores can co-exist in happiness!",

    "text": "Finally!  A place that serves phenomenal meals without the guilt trip.    Auditions are coming in close, so Ive been training and eating at home to further reach my goal.  But once a week I'll have a cheat meal and that's where Greens and Proteins comes in to play.   I've only been here twice, and i have yet steered away from the Ginger Limeade Juice: Green Grapes, Spinach, Ginger, Lime, Agave Nectar, and blended with ice.  Sounds iffy, but trust me it is amazing.    I tried the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap and the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap on two separate visit and they're both freakin' amazing. I love how the Teriyaki Sauce on their Wrap was not overly too sweet nor thick.  Perfect to my liking without the feeling of going over the edge since I'm sensitive to sugary taste.  The Bison Cheese Steak is probably my favorite Cheese Steak, ever!  The meat was juicy and loaded with big flavor.  Tossed with onions, red peppers, and low fat mozzarella cheese.  This one truly hit the spot and reset all my cravings for the week.  You choose Wheat or Spinach for the wrap, and also Tofu Fries or Spicy Jicama Slices for the sides.  The spice level of the Jicama is just enough to tickle your taste buds.  Great fillers.  Tofu Fries are lightly bread, baked, and served with their Russian Sauce (Low Fat Mayo, Ketchup, and Relish).  Only small gripe is that i wish the portion was just a tad bit smaller.  I have no self control when food is placed in front of me and usually end up finishing it all.   #firstworldproblems.  Service is impeccable and restaurant is super clean and spacious.  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu.",

My favorite is the California Chicken wrap, it comes with a side of tofu fries and you'd never guess it was tofu. They're crispy and well seasoned. My favorite drink is the green smoothie, it's refreshing and you can barely taste the greens. Check this place out, their menu is healthy and the prices aren't too bad.",

When I asked the cashier what gluten free options they had he didn't really seem to know and suggested to sub burgers buns for gluten free buns or wheat pizza crusts for gluten free, then told me their wraps were gluten free, which according to the menu they are not. He was still friendly and courteous. I ended up ordering the Ahi Protein Salad. It looked delicious, unfortunately wasn't though. The ahi had little to no flavor, neither did any other part of the salad. The lettuce were probably the most flavorful part as well as the artichoke which tasted like it came out of a can. I even asked for dressing and tried multiple different ones. None of which made much of a difference. I've eaten at Greens and Proteins many times at their other location and was very disappointed about this meal, especially for $14.99.",

The staff was always friendly and their service has always been great but that recently changed.   Last week I noticed my bank statement had a charge from Greens and protein but I hadn't been there in a month so I checked my statements and also noticed that I had two charges to my card the last time I was there (one was not approved) I called the store to see why I had a total of $27 charged to my card with out my approval and when I told the person who answered the reason why I was calling they asked if I was Diana, apparently I wasn't the only one with this problem.   The manager \"couldn't get to the phone\" so I went to the store and spoke to him in person. He claims they had a \"glitch\" with their system and promised it wasn't fraud on their behalf and that there was 5 other people with the same problem. He also said he would call me on Monday (i went in on a Friday) once he figured out what went wrong,  a week has gone by and I haven't heard anything from them. I had my bank investigate the charge and they returned my money.   I no longer trust this restaurant and I would warn anyone who eats here to check their bank accounts.",

Service is always friendly, but can be hit or miss because the likelihood they will mess up your order is almost 50%....haha. But they are very nice about remaking food if they got something wrong.  I love breakfast foods so my fave go-to is the tomato mozzarella frittata (which comes with this amazing watermelon salad!!!)  Be wary of all the gym rats that frequent this place....G&P's are very conveniently located next to a LVAC gym, and you can definitely tell they attract that clientele ;) This particular location is is probably my fave (been to the one on Flamingo which isn't as warm or bright) and while neon green isn't my favorite color, the restaurant is overall very clean and modern.",

On a positive note the sweet potato fries were good.   We wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and try their smoothies.

My family decided to get some food as well as some drinks too. Keep in mind this was all vegan food. The burgers I got were quite bland and I did not enjoy the jicama fries at all. The pizza I ordered was made incorrectly. The watermelon strawberry drink I ordered was just bad. Not one person in my family liked it. And one drink was just flat out missing. I called them and they said \"oh it's right here\" but they had locked the doors behind me to close up and would not give me my last drink, even though I could see it in the counter through the window. I ordered through yelp, who tried to get a refund for me on my behalf, but this place would only refund me for 1 drink and the pizza. I got stuck paying for 2 terrible burgers and 1 terrible drink as well. Not cool.  I do really like their smoothie options though.",

Everything you need is here if you're trying to slim down, following Paleo, like eating healthy, or are in to getting more than just the typical bland smoothie. The setup is clean, the service is nothing short of excellent and I will definitely be going back. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because the portion sizes are always inconsistent. One visit I'll get a perfectly sized chicken breast or bison meat, the next time the meat is barely enough to qualify as a snack for a five year old at recess. Some type of uniformity here so I know whether to order extra meat or not would help.  Regardless, the shakes are good and the food is delicious.  And the place is really a 4.5 it's just that this place has to be scored on a scale. When I eat at some places I think wow this food is amazing because A) the process to make was long and complex so I needed someone else to just make it B) it would be hard to find those ingredients to make it or C) it's something new that I have no idea how to make. This place doesn't apply to either of those criteria, its basic and you can make it yourself if you have the time and its going to taste exactly how you think its going to taste. (Chicken, asparagus and couscous - there's no surprise here you know what it's going to taste like but hey its good and if you want to stray away from basic the wraps and hamburger will do the trick). BUT this is not a knock on the place because I will be here every week attempting to counter the fried cheese bacon dough thingamajig I will probably have every weekend. And their juices and smoothies are actually different from what you'll find around town and actually have me feeling better after I down one so even if you hate eating healthy, their juice and smoothies are still worth the trip.",

The food was better than I thought it was going to be, but definitely not the most flavored packed menu.  I tried the bison cheesesteak with tofu fries and I guess I was hoping for a little more flavor in the bison other than just salt...really it's a chopped up bison burger patty put in a wrap.  The tofu fries were all the rave on the reviews...but in comparison to the Chinese salt and pepper tofu squares...they were quite lack luster and dry in my opinion. The service seems like it could be refined, the couple that we ate with got a number with their order, while we did not.  The server seemed to wander from table to table asking what people ordered in order to deliver food.  The decor was bright and refreshing and the Hawaiian music in the background made it good environment for a Sunday lunch.  I probably won't be venturing back to this restaurant anytime soon, but I think the location near LVAC and perhaps for the calorie and health conscious this place is a win.",

    "text": "The name of this place alone makes me think wheat grass and vegetarian menus, which for me is a turn off because I am a meat and potatoes type guy.  My wife and eye kept seeing excellent reviews for this place, and the place being advertised all over the place.  Two weeks ago my wife and I were looking for a new place to try, and  she brought up this place.  I thought I would give it a shot, event though I expected it to be a tofu and salad type place.  When we walked into the restaurant I was met with surprise...  This place is not that just a vegetarian place.  They have a rather large menu with a mix of meat, fruits and vegetables.  They have everything from your staple foods such as chicken and beef, to exotic foods like bison and ostrich.  My wife had the bison lettuce burger which was very flavorful. My favorite aspect of this restaurant is the custom meal which allows you to pick from a number of meats ranging from poultry to fish to beef.  The meal also allows you to pick a vegetable, which there are several to choose from, a grain (also several choices), and a sauce of your choice.  I got the chicken with mixed greens, quinoa, and balsamic dressing.  Everything about the meal was excellent.  It was so good that my wife and I have eaten there 4 more times in the past two weeks.  It has become one of our favorite places to eat now.  We have also tried their smoothies with are very good as well.  The decor in this place is very cool, and their are a lot of outlets for electronic devices, which makes this place a great place to study or just go to get work done.  I have also found this a good place for many who go to LVAC to go an hang out and get a good, healthy meal.  I do agree with some of the reviews that this place should have more \"eco friendly\" materials, and the price is somewhat steep for meals.  This will not deter me from going here again.",

It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)",

    "text": "The title on the front: \"Healthy Kitchen\", that alone should be the warning. If a business has to advertise that, they are trying too hard.  Maybe we have high standards because we are from California where we know what good, clean Vegan food actually is. When we walked in the manager/server (?) jumped up and said \"Hello, Welcome\", then went back to leaning over the front counter with his phone in his face. Everything seemed okay while ordering at the counter. The realization that I was in a gross place started when I went to pour water. Tap water from the Coke machine. What \"health\" oriented  business has anything to do with the Coca-Cola company (FYI: corrupt evil corporation). Any truly healthful food restaurant knows what clean/pure water is. Not this place.  When my Veggie Burger arrived the GF bun was SO DRY and starchy it was like eating stale duck feed. And it's not just my bun, my husband had a standard wheat bun with his veggie burger. I went to the sidebar to check out the condiments like ketchup and mustard: SYSCO. If the basic condiments are SYSCO with high fructose corn syrup, just imagine the rest of the ingredients in the kitchen, and their source. Some of the reviews here say \"I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients\", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame. The Veggie patty was bland beans. The Tofu \"fries\" were so fried there was no tofu left in the middle, shriveled and soaking in oil. Gross. The Thai ginger soup I got was like a think gloppy pudding. I tried putting it on my burger like a condiment to make it more edible. Didn't help.  My son got the GF Veggie pizza, the only thing flavorful on the table, because it was drenched in oil.  If you have HEALTH standards, are Vegan or Gluten-Free, I would NOT recommend this place. It is a cheap chain, with rip-off prices.  Unfortunately, we left half of our food on the plate uneaten, walked out highly disappointed and feeling sick and gross from the quality of food.",

Especially for strip mall food but lots of quality and fresh ingredients make this a justifiable expense. This is not just a bunch of freeze dried crap from the Sysco truck.   Here's the thing for this glorious temple of health: we really need detailed nutritional information. Myself and the other regular clients are extremely dietarily concerned. We have Macros and Calorie totals that are a delicate balance, and the nutritional information we get, when we get it, will just be a calorie number. That number is clearly not accurate as often it is attached to an item that can be served seven different ways. They also don't elaborate on side items. We really need detailed counts of carbs, protein and fat and a way to account for how changes in order (extra cheese, different wrap type, etc...) account for changes in nutritional information.  I wouldn't normally complain about this for a restaurant that has two locations but this is crucial for this type of establishment. If this existed I would easily give them five stars.",

I really dig a place that purports to be fresh and healthy *and actually is*. There were little things that made the experience better, as well. The staff was obviously very happy and interested in their food, our satisfaction, etc. It didn't feel forced, they actually seemed happy to be there and like they cared what we thought. And this might sound lame, but we didn't order drinks, and they proactively offered water cups to us, and then we saw that the water was nor just a fountain-style plain water but rather a cucumber/lemon water concoction that tasted great.  The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 is that it IS a bit pricey. Our two meals, without drinks, came to $20. And the second time I went I got a medium-ish sized smoothie for more than $8. But I feel like that's worth it for what we got: indisputably fresh, healthy meals.  I'll be going back regularly.",

Their friendly service was about the only redeeming factor, and I'm still wondering if it could be the smoothies that bring people back here and keep it packed. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this, because I didn't try one.   I had the build your own plate with basmati rice, \"marinated\" tofu, broccoli, and to my dismay, lemon vinegrette. I began to order it with teriyaki sauce in mind, but when I inquired about the peanut sauce just to see, I was informed that the only two vegan sauces were lemon vinegrette or a balsamic reduction. Caught off guard I went for lemon, which turned out to be straight up lemon juice and olive oil. The tofu was far from marinated, and I smothered my food in hot sauce to make it a little more edible. The broccoli was just fine, but even a decent steamed vegetable doesn't have the power to save bland tofu and dry rice.  The tofu \"French fries\" were the only thing I tasted that I would even consider paying money for... But that won't happen since I won't be giving this place a second chance. Perhaps it's a just a hit or miss kind of place, but if that's the case, then I would like to know what that hit is. I sure didn't get lucky.",

Trying to stay on your diet plan for that summer body?  The items on the menu have their calorie count posted, so you can tell just how many miles it would take to burn off lunch.  If you don't care about that sort of thing, the food is still quite delicious.  I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken wrap w/ jicama \"fries,\"  and a smoothie that had pretty much everything in the garden in it.  I can't recall the name, but it was green and wonderful.    I live pretty far from here, but luckily the nice woman at the register told me that a new location could be opening in Summerlin sometime soon.  In the meantime, I'll make the trek for something nourishing, tasty, and satisfying, it's certainly worth the drive.",

    "text": "What an interesting place!  The feel of the restaurant is young and hip and the vibrant green of the decor makes the place feel fun and eclectic.  This is my first time here even though I often go next door and hit up Starbucks.  The menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over.  They are gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and low-carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups, salads, burgers, 9\" pizzas, smoothies, sandwiches/wraps and a choice to even create your own meal.  After pondering what to eat I decided on a burger.  What is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then I would be encouraged to try more off the menu.   I ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium (they also have ostrich which I have never had) and tofu fries.  There is also an option for the jicama fries.  I was told the jicama fries are fry-shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing.  I shied away from the jicama because I have not had it before personally but I did hear they are good.  The tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried.  They are delicious!  The burger can come on a wheat or gluten-free bun or as a wrap. I chose the wheat bun and got Swiss cheese on my burger.  The burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty, lettuce, tomato and onion!  I can barely fit it in my mouth!  The bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect.  I took a bite and the burger is done exactly right (medium), juicy and tender.    For my buffalo burger, tofu fries, pickle and a soda cost me a little over $14 including tax.  A good price for a nice buffalo burger.  Also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets.  This is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers!   The place is WiFi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network. When I asked the staff about power access they did not know but I was able to speak to Jeff, one of the owners, and he was able to show me where to plug in.  For those needing a place to work there are a TON of plugs (long power strips) under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant. Just a little looking and you will see them.         If you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat (even with your GF, Vegan or Uber-health conscious friends)  then look no further than the Greens and Proteins!",

Ha!  Any who... When I did in fact visit, my brother said \"I have a great lunch spot I know you will like... Greens & Proteins!\" - I pretended to act like I didn't know what the place was all about but let's be real, I ALREADY KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO ORDER!   Sadly, when we got there, I learned they didn't have ostrich on the menu anymore (I was looking at an old menu on yelp), and their bison is no grass-finished so I mixed that option and went for my staple, salmon. As for sides, I got asparagus, sweet potatoes and added on avocado!   Our food arrived maybe 12 minutes later, and looks amazing.... Granted I thought my Salmon portion looked a little small (but I didn't say anything). My brother and his fiance got bison burgers and my husband got the Cali Chicken Wrap. No one had any problems with their Food. I was initially a bit concerned for my husband because he pretty much hates everything he eats unless it's chick fil a but he did not complain at all and ACTUALLY ADMITTED to the wrap being good! He also got a peanut butter shake (that he was initially very skeptical of because when it arrived to him it looked slightly green), and sucked that baby dry!  If and when we visit my brother again, this spot will definitely be on the list of places to eat at, for a quick and lighter lunch (depending on what you order) as I am a huge fan of \"build your own plate\" restaurants!",

They have a variety of food to choose from and they are able to accommodate those who have specific diet needs(vegan, vegetarian, etc).    Today we ordered the Bison cheese steak wrap and ahi protein salad.  Both were great selections.  No complaints here.  However, my \"go to\" dish is the BBQ chicken pizza.  Yummm!  Food is consistently good here.  I love the fact that they serve complimentary cucumber water.  The staff is always pleasant and friendly.  Parking is fairly easy, right front of the establishment.  They share a parking area with Starbucks and The Original Sunrise Cafe.",

Overall, it was....okay. Average. Very average. The interior is pretty hip and I appreciated the vibe of the place when you walked in, but that's really the only great thing about it. The music was playing so loud at the time that it was very hard to hear the person behind the cash register talking to you.   I am not a big fan of onions and ordered their BBQ pizza, so I requested that they don't put any on it. Upon receiving the pizza, the receipt specifically said no onions, yet there were a massive amount of onions on it. Okay, then.   It was quite busy while we were there, so I chalked it up to a busy day mistake. It was also next to impossible to wave somebody down about changing the order. Luckily my spouse ordered something that I could trade with.   The food itself was very bland. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. It was just very....normal. This paired with the experience kind of left a bad taste in my mouth and while I'd be open to going back there to try a smoothie, I don't think I'll be going back for the food or staying there to eat.",

I cannot even tell you the number of times I have received eye rolls or attitude from people when I have made special requests from other places. The staff at Greens & Proteins were so attentive and friendly!  I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie (mine with no banana & no avocado, with soy milk + extra scoop of soy protein).

I don't eat bread so they are wonderful about wrapping it in \"butter lettuce\" instead. It was super tasty, cooked exactly how I like it (medium rare) and the ingredients are always really fresh!  It totally hit the spot and I felt full of energy and ready to go, once I finished eating.

As a vegan, Herby asked about vegan sauces, the employee at the register didn't seem super confident but perfectly friendly. Tofu was a bit mushy and had no marinated flavor. Quinoa was really watery like it hadn't been properly strained. Edamame was good. The portion size looked small on the plate, but was actually filling. Cost was $10, wouldn't order again.  Carnivore Review Carno ordered the bison cheesesteak in a cabbage wrap with tofu fries with water cup. The meat was really tasty and well flavored. Everything was really fresh and clean-tasting. At a lot of restaurants like this, there are issues with portion size, but this place has great portion size (3 handfuls worth of food) and macro cost. Definitely recommend a fork since it will fall apart as you eat (like all leaf wraps do). Cost was $11-12, would order again.  Overall Food was ready in less than 10 minutes and total cost was about $25 with tax. The number of vegan options is above 5, so high enough for Herby to return. Carno enjoyed the food, it's definitely a good place to go if you want to feel full without killing your ratios for the day.",

The dressing was super light and lacked a lot of flavor. I wish there had been more. I liked the addition of the Parmesan.  Overall, this was not a salad worth the price. I'll go elsewhere.

Super happy they're open later than the others!   I have been here a few times before, I've had their smoothies which are consistently tasty, blended well and healthy. (don't forget to use the check-in offer!)   This time I opted for a meal since I just finished my lifting workout. I got the build your own HCG meal which comes with a choice of protein and vegetables. I got the grilled chicken breast, which was grilled perfectly. Tender and juicy on the inside. And steamed asparagus, which was cooked well. It also comes with a lemon slice and side sauce, tasted like a dijon mustard. Meal pricing is based on what meat you choose, chicken breast was $10. Packed in a reusable container. The portion size and price were just right.   *** LOVES:  - fast and friendly service! Cashier was nice and helpful with answering my questions and the guy cleaning up tables and serving orders was also friendly and helpful. He offered to check on my order so I didn't have to wait long. I really wasn't waiting long. ;-)   - Loved the way it's designed. Clean, open, modern interior. Loved the green trim. ** complimentary cucumber lemon water. My choice of drink is always water, no matter where I go. Have to stay hydrated!   Other likes:  - tvs available to watch the game  - not crowded or busy when we went (Thursday, 8pm)  - a lot of healthy options, looking forward to trying them  - new locations popping up all over the valley  Loved this place, will be back again and recommending to others!   TIP: don't forget if you haven't used it, they still have the check-in offer,  $1 OFF smoothie!",

One of my favorite things about the Henderson area is the amount of amazing different dining options. I literally could grub off Eastern for a month straight and not get bored. Greens and Proteins is a unique healthier fresh option of just about anything you normally eat. They offer fresh juices and smoothies with everything from kale, to watermelon, pineapple and wheat grass. They also have elk and ostrich burgers and bison cheesesteaks. My personal favorites are the wellness drink (a veggie/fruit mixture) and the berry parfait. That comes with yogurt, house made granola, dried and fresh fruit. There are breakfast lunch and dinner options available, and they come with sides like jicama or tofu fries. This place has made eating healthy so much easier. The staff is polite and educated in the foods they offer. There is also a \"spa water\" which is a cucumber lemon infused water. YUM. Honestly, I plan on being the duchess to this place very soon.  Extra: check in on yelp for a $1 off :)",

The service is abhorrently slow, they aren't particularly customer-centric and the prices for what you get are super high.  I've been in several times, don't know why I'm just now writing this, but I get the same thing generally every time.  This time walked up and was just asking a generic question, but was definitely ready to order when the guy in front of me picked up the phone and spent 3-4 minutes taking someone's order that was calling in. I just stood there and stared until he was done. Super rude.  Ordered the vegetable parm and it came with a small side of spinach. I was under the impression that I was getting a side of spaghetti squash, but it was actually UNDER the parm. Weird. This small plate of absolutely nothing cost me $10. Not happy.   I've had pizza here before as well and while it had a nice taste to it, it again wasn't worth what I paid for it.  I get the concept here and I'm sure it looks cool when you hang out a place that touts itself as so healthy, but it really is a ripoff and the food isn't that great; it's just OKAY.   Save some money and do it yourself, really.",

The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is delicious and healthy, so I say it's worth it.  It's hard to find healthy \"fast food\" but this definitely qualifies.  And it's right off the 215, so if you have 15-20 minutes to spare and want to grab something good for you, I highly recommend this place.",

Their burgers are EXTREMELY hefty and filling and I just love the whole set up of it all!  Look: wooden tables, waterfall walls, tv's displaying most sport shows and news stations, good music, and different kinds of condiments!   Fave food: Pizzas, burgers, breakfast, smoothies",

Feels like an extension of LVAC and I'm the only lazy bum who didn't work up a sweat prior to coming here lol.  The decor is modern yet feels green and nature-inspired.  I really like the look of this place.    I paid an arm and a leg for my Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie (note: 1 dollar off for checking in) and I almost had buyer's remorse as I waited in line.  The line moved quickly enough and service was friendly but, hot damn, it took FOREVER to get my smoothie.  It's the only thing I ordered - no food, just a smoothie to go.  And I waited.  And waited.  And waited.    Finally my name was called and I thought for sure this was going to be an out-of-this-world smoothie experience.  All the hype, all the waiting, all that cash I forked over... built up to this moment.  I try the smoothie and I'm all, \"eh\".  Oh the sweet sting of health-food disappointment.   I give it 3 stars because I like the concept and the decor, the service was good, and there are quite a few things on the menu I really want to try (pizza, wraps, etc.), so I'm sure I'll be back to update this.",

Also, the gluten free pizza is really yummy. I suggest getting it extra crispy though. Only downfall for me is that their \"juices\" are smoothies and not green enough for me. Overall, a great place to check out if you ate trying to eat healthier",

He got the Bison burger with the raw jicama fries (I think that's what they were?). Mine was so yummy and that was the first time I ever tried tofu fries. They were seasoned so well. The wrap was delicious as well. It was a little bit dry but overall it had great flavor.   My husband's bison burger was probably the best thing out of both of ours. It was so yummy and juicy. I wish I got his burger instead, lol. I wasn't a fan of the raw jicama fries. They had a good seasoning on them but I did not care for them.   I cannot comment on how the service was or what the decor looked like because he took it to go. We will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.",

The wrap was amazing. Not sure if the soup was even what I ordered. Just seemed like a cream of something, no chunks of anything in it. The taste was fine, but I don't think it was what I ordered. The complimentary \"cucumber lemon\" water was way too cucumber-y and there was absolutely zero lemon in it. False advertising. If the soup was right and the water was more to what I expected this would have made five stars. I will go back again to try other wraps and their burgers. A great healthy alternative.",

    "text": "The concept excited me. Healthier, lower calorie vegan//vegetarian options served alongside healthier, lower calorie meaty options - a place I could go with my meat-eater friends and not feel jipped.   The above concept is really all that was exciting for me at Greens and Protein. Unfortunately, the food was rather bland.   I ordered the plate with tofu (protein), asparagus (green) and quinoa. The quinoa tasted literally like quinoa. No seasoning, nothing. Likewise, the asparagus failed to incite even a slight quiver in my taste buds. The tofu was passable - but I'll eat tofu made any way.   My husband ordered the raw mock chicken lettuce cups. I actually found this dish offensive and puny in serving size. But my husband liked it.   One of my friends ordered the bison burger which he relished and the other one, a similar plate like mine but with a grilled portobello mushroom instead of quinoa. The mushroom was actually very good.   We shared the tofu fries - quite good but I really wish they weren't fried. What's the point of a healthy meal?   The drinks were ridiculously priced so I refused to have any.   All in all...nice concept, progressive for Vegas and a place you could hang if you were on a strict caloric diet. But being satisfied with your meal...that's another story.",

I still appreciate what they do, but the quality is slippling.   The last few visits have been a nightmare.  My fiance and I used to visit several times a week to get pizzas.  The last two times, the pizzas have been inedibly burned on the bottom.  One time, it took so long that we were given a complimentary drink.  The last time we visited, my fiance and I ordered the exact same thing but I got my pizza literally TWENTY MINUTES before he got his.  I really think they forgot to make it, because when I asked the person who brought me my food about it, he scrambled into the kitchen and the workers suddenly hopped-to.  There was nothing resembling an apology either.  Also, the last time I got a Wellness Drink (my favorite), it was still chunky and wouldn't fit through the straw.  Eww.  I didn't notice until I left or I would have sent it back.  The Wellness Drink is SOOOO expensive, but I don't really mind... that is, if the quality matches the price.  A note to the owners of this place (because I've talked to you and I KNOW you read this):  Just because you get busy doesn't mean you can let the quality become inconsistent.  It's great to have an increased sales volume, but customer loyalty is important too.  I haven't recommended this to a friend for a while because, frankly, I'm not sure if it's going to be a good G&P day or a bad G&P day anymore.  I haven't been to G&P for a while.  I'm not really itching to return anytime soon either.",

The second time i came i had a Coffee-Chocolate-Veggie Shake (720 calories) and mediocre with a LARGE chicken Cesar salad: small quantity limp romaine lettuce, some stale tortilla chip broken up, a little bit parmesan cheese thrown on the bottom --- the dressing was like a flavored mayonnaise on the side.  Really weird taste on the tortilla chips almost like cheetos and the rest was dry.  The chicken itself, while not grilled, as at least passable.  Not the sterling experience I had hoped for.",

    "text": "Visited this place for the first time today. The girl at the cash register was not helpful at helping us decide what to order and I actually felt very rushed and u welcomed by her. I purchased a groupon to use toward two breakfast items. I accidentally ordered the banana protein pancakes along with a Greek pizza. The girl got really annoyed when I presented her the groupon and told me it was only valid for two breakfast items, which the Greek pizza was not. She recommended the acai fruit bowl which I had no choice but to accept since I did not want to inconvenience her any further. I'll give this place a 4 star review because  the food was really delicious being that it's a lot healthier than I'm used to and the young waiter who brought out our food made up for the cashiers lack of customer service. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to change your diet but are afraid of trying foods a little out of your comfort zone. They have a variety of items to satisfy your cravings for breakfast lunch or dinner. However, the prices are definitely high enough to scare you away but I think it's worth the visit every now and then.",

You think gluten free would be hard, try being gf, dairy, soy, canola, rice, and potato free (amongst others) due to sensitivities. It's rough.  After carefully reading their menu for about 8 minutes, the wonderful cashier helped me out with a few specifics. I ordered the bison patty with kale and sweet potato mash, and the lump crab and avocado lettuce cups. I watched as they made sure EVERYONE in the kitchen was alerted to the specifics of the ticket, consulted the recipe book just in case, and made sure they had my back as they prepared my food.  It was all great, clean food. I couldn't ask for more. Thank you so so much. Recommended to every person around.",

    "text": "Best smoothies in Las Vegas, - whether you are vegan or not, these are unvelivable and very healthy, and not loaded with disguised names for sugars like turbinado, cane sugar,  etc. Although they do have honey and /or agave in them so you can ask for that to be omitted, you wont miss it. I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally. They sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them!  Although i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99 , otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the \"build your own custom meal\" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after. Another issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes. , combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth.",

If you want more of a pure juice there's nothing better than the Wellness Drink...  They just started doing breakfast and their Tofu and chicken sausage wrap is awesome.  I don't ever eat Tofu but the chef made me a deal. He said if the Tofu in the wrap was not as good or better than egg whites he would give me my money back.  I'm hooked!!!

I'm just going to give a quick positive/negative feedback:  Positives:                 Space- It's clean and has modern, simple  decor. Easy to sit and chat for a while.                Turkey- It's real, sliced turkey; not processed deli meat.  Negatives:                    Food quality- I'm annoyed how they come across to everyone. They want you to think this is amazing healthy food.  Not one item on their menu is organic.  They also don't have a lot of alternative ingredients to choose from. They seem to have limited knowledge of gluten-free and vegan foods. This leads me to the next negative.                   Price- It is pretty expensive.  At least 7 dollars for a smoothie and at least 10 dollars for a sandwich.  It would be understandable if they used organic, high quality ingredients, but no.  Their ingredients do not cost much at all, therefore they are taking advantage of people.                   Environmentally friendly? - First of all, they don't use real plates. (They care about health but not environment.) So they use paper plates.  Okay, at least they quickly biodegrade.  But wait! The utensils are crappy plastic ones.  What the heck? Be consistent.   Overall, I seriously feel that whoever opened this place does not care about any of the things they market.  I think they know that being healthy is in, and are trying to bank on it.  They should be serving organic fruits, veggies and meats.  They should have a vast working knowledge of other types of foods for substitutions. They should be using real plates and silverware, or using all biodegradable/compostable things.  And they should not be insulting our intelligence. Needless to say, I'm not going back.  I'd rather spend my money on a place that gives quality food for a normal price.",

They offer delicious protein shakes and you can have them ADD things such as blue berries, celery etc... I like the Turkey burger and tofu fries. Check it out and I am sure you will go back over and over.",

Let me start by saying that they offer $1 off juices and smoothies with Yelp check in! My go-to drink would be their Wellness Drink. It contains green grapes, green apples, pineapples, oranges, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed and agave. Sounds like a salad gone wrong, but it's delicious. Its sweet, so you don't get the overpowering vegetable taste. Just remember to keep stirring it so you don't get a thick sludge at the end. It's an awesome meal replacement or a post workout drink.   Their food is just as healthy as their drinks. Nothing is processed and everything is made to order. I like their tofu fries (light on the seasoning) and their margherita pizza as well. They have burgers and wraps, with the options of whole wheat buns or spinach tortillas as substitutions. They also offer unique items like bison or ostrich patties for your burgers. The prices are a little higher here, but you have to remember that eating healthy doesn't come cheap. You do get high quality ingredients and friendly helpful service. So I think it's so worth the price.",

I like that both locations are located in the same plaza as the gym I belong to, it's convinient to grab a bite to eat afterwards. So why not 5 stars? Here's my beef with G&P:  1. The listed calories next to the item doesn't count the entire entree, i.e;       *Turkey Burger w/ alfafla, L,T,O and low fat cheese (served on a bun and tofu fries) that is everything included in the entree, so my thought would be the calorie count should include everything, right? Nope, it doesn't include the bun or the tofu fries or the cheese.   2. Food should be organic for the price. Especially the vegetables/fruits going into the juices & smoothies. Average price is $7.50.  3. Employees should be more knowledgable about their product. When I asked two employees about the calorie count, both gave me a different answer. Also, when I had lunch with my vegan friend, she asked if the sauce that came with the tofu fries was vegan, the girl had no idea, she had to go in the back to ask. Turns out, it's not.   I still like the place, I am just more aware of what I'm eating here. There are a few items on the menu I'm in love with, vegan pizza, tofu fries and the wellness drink, these will keep me coming back, also I love the cucumber water.",

So, I tried calling once more to see if it was a mistake and the kid who answered was absolutely rude. Dramatically sighing out of irritation, that I was calling so close to closing time.

But this isn't a review about whole foods is it? I always think these health food places are just a fad, I reference that specific store because they are known for fresh deliciousness, I visit it from time to time, buying $15 juiced items when I feel like I want to support John Mackey and Rene Lawson Hardy. I love the movement of natural produce, I don't love the prices though, but let me just say Proteins and Greens surprised me, I honestly thought I would have I regret my purchase but I was fine! No buyers remorse! First of all big shoutout to the cashier for so pleasantly manning the line, the situation was heavily trafficked and she did it effortlessly! She prescribed the right thing for me to try and now I fell in love with this lil gem of a healthy dine spot. Bison cheesesteak and tofu fries. Let me just say I hate tofu (except one specific dish that my friends mother makes)... These fries will change your tofu-hating life. DELICIOUS. Ok. Let's talk about the \"Wellness Drink\" Green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, agave   You know what. Done talking.   'Twas a spectacular first for me.  4 star, it is a little pricey- If I'm already spending that I expect all organic.

They knocked it out of the park!!  First, they were so polite from the first time I called several weeks ago to inquire about their catering. I mean they really sounded excited to help me, even though at that point, I was just feeling out the local businesses to see who we'd go with. Then I had made a few changes to the menu this last week, at which time they still sounded excited to do our large order. Then, the day before our event, I got a call from the chef and we talked over all our menu selections and I modified a couple items. My wife can't eat onions, so not only did they comply with removing onions from one of the items, but he made suggestions to add something else to compensate...above and beyond, love it!  Their catering menu online is easy to pick from and does a nice job describing the items. I do recommend the .pdf version as it's easier to read. We had a party for about 20 people, and while we bought way too much food, people were all raving about it and I think every single person asked me where we got it. I was so happy with all the selection.   We had quite a list: -Chicken quinoa cups (fantastic) -Mini ahi tostadas (didn't last long, omg they were good!) -Thai peanut chicken satay (awesome chicken strips on a stick!) -Grilled buffalo chicken skewers -Sweet potato goat cheese skewers (I wish we'd gotten 5 orders of these instead of 1, they are heavenly) -Tenderloin beef tip skewers (gone by the time I got food :-) a sign of how good they were ) -Angus sliders (didn't get one, but people were raving! This is where I didn't get the onions and   the substitution was made...people loved them) -Caprese sliders (so good and tasted so fresh!) -1 each of grilled asparagus salad and the pear and goat cheese salad (both were so fresh and both fantastic) the salads are pretty big.   My pickup was at 5:30 and these guys were finishing it up on time to the minute. As the guys were carrying some of the items to my car, the chef and his crew were finishing up some of the last minute hot items. It was really busy in the restaurant and I truly appreciate that as I left, not only did the chef take a minute to go over everything with me, but one of the other guys took time to stand and look me in the eye, wish me luck with the party and said he really wanted feedback on how everything tasted.  Absolutely fantastic customer service and food for this catering event that was very important to me and my family! Thank you to the team at Greens and Proteins for making it wonderful!",

Each item lists the nutritional facts of the meal, ensuring you know exactly what you are feeding your body! I couldn't ask for more.

    "text": "My friend and I came here yesterday after our workout. It was kind of pricey and honestly I didn't like anything that much. I really was just eating because I was hungry as fuck and also I spent a stupid amount of money on a juice so I felt obligated to finish it. I did have a $1 off juice/smoothie coupon for checking in when I got there but $7.50 for a juice is a little insane. My friend got a veggie tofu wrap thing with tofu fries and we shared that and the smoothie. My other friend got a broccoli cheddar soup.  The wrap was kind of weird. A lot of veggies (duh) but super bland for me. I had to put some ketchup on it. The fries were alright, super strange but the dipping sauce was delicious. My friend claimed to really enjoy the wrap and faux fries. I was pretty meh about them.  My Most Expensive Juice Ever was ok. It tasted kind of weird and looked downright nasty. My friend thought it was ok too. But for that much money I was expecting a strawfull of heaven or top shelf scotch at least, not just an \"ok\" drink. My other friend got one whole piece of broccoli in his soup, that lucky man. He ate really slow and when we left he still had like half a bowl sitting there. He and I were both still hungry as fuck when we left. So that was a bummer. Also- some guy in line next to me described the menu perfectly: \"can you not decide what you want because everything looks so good, or because nothing stands out to you? I'm the latter.\" That sums it up.",

When this place first opened, they gave the option of stevia in their smoothies and they were actually great. Not anymore. Call yourself a smoothie bar, not a juice bar. Furthest thing from it. And are those berries you're offering organic? I doubt it. The best thing about the menu is their variety of meats and vegan options, as well as gf options. I agree with one of the commenters that the food is often bland and they're all still on this low fat thing. At least give high fat options for those of us that realize the importance of saturated fats. Not everyone who is health conscious gets excited about low fat mozzarella and egg whites. In fact, it hurts my soul, every time.  The flavored water that they call juice is the worst, though. I hope they improve.",

The fruit cup was maybe 1/3 of a cup size, he was disappointed because he really loves fruit a lot and wanted more.  California grilled chicken wrap was bland, it was begging for some seasoning.

Taste - I had the greens shake (something I could have made at home) but the price was okay for the convenience and it tasted perfect to its name (apples, kale, banana, and other greens).  We also had the bison burger (wow!) juicy! They have crispy and tasty sweet potato fry options and the kids pizza was huge! My kids loved it.",

They have a wide variety of healthy options including anything from a hearty protein shake, grilled chicken salad or even a gluten-free vegan pizza which lately has been my absolute favorite.   + Conveniently located within walking distance to the gym + Large variety of options, so there's something for everyone + They have gluten-free vegan options  + Outdoor seating patio options   - I typically go when it's busy so there's usually a wait - A little pricey. My friend and I ordered a gluten-free vegan pizza with a large rough-cut roma salad (no meat) to split and it was about $30 - yikes!    Overall, yes I would definitely recommend this place as I go here at least once a week. Their wellness green drink is super refreshing and as I mentioned before I'm a fan of their gluten-free vegan pizza; however, you can't really go wrong with anything.",

(There wasn't much option)  Lettuce in the salad wasn't fresh and fried tofu was one of that cheap hard one, couldn't even swallow.  We also ordered carrot juice which wasn't juice at all!  They don't even have a juicer, so all of their \"juice\" is actually a smoothie.  I like a smoothie but I do not like carrot smoothie.  All the carrots pulps grossed me out and I only drank half that's because I didn't wanna waste it.  My friends ordered a different kind of juice but were the same thing. Veggies in my veggie wrap were super greasy.   We dined inside and tables/booth weren't clean. Also,  I am a dog person and I love dog-friendly restaurants,  I bring my dog with me everywhere but this guy next to our table had a pretty big dog and he was letting his dog walk on the booth and come to our table and lick table, sniff.  We were ok with it but I was surprised that the restaurant staff didn't say anything to him.",

The restaurant is huge with a lot of seating and places to park as well! The location is easy to find! I came in not knowing what I wanted! I was stuck on what smoothie to get and I asked the worked which he recommended and he gave me his honest opinion on which drinks were the popular ones and he also asked what type of ingredients I like! From there he recommended a smoothie for me to order! Once I ordered my smoothie took only 5 minutes to make! I was worried it would take long but it was done quickly and I loved that! I will definitely come back very season to try other items on the menu! Great customer service! Come check this place out!",

She then tells me to contact GrubHub for a refund (though the order was placed correctly and had nothing to do with the driver or Grub Hub ordering service).  I called GrubHub only then to have the rep tell me that they are telling him a different story and that they aren't going to remake my food. The rep offers me a $10 credit which I never asked for. I JUST WANTED THE CORRECT FOOD.   Will never return back to this place. Like come on it's a $10 item, I never wanted my money back. I just wanted my tacos to be made correctly.",

The salads are okay, but I always think \"I could have made this at home.\"  Nothing special there.  The veggie burger is just blah.  Little flavor, strange texture (as others have mentioned), and unpleasantly sticky.  Even with cheese, I didn't find it to have a good taste -- I ended up slathering the veggie burger with mustard.  If you're going for a quick smoothie or a pizza, then Greens and Proteins is a good option.  However, I can't recommend anything else on the menu.",

Greens and Proteins was the perfect afternoon snack/meal for my in between spa, errands, and gym session.   It would make sense that this health conscience business would be located in front of the LVAC. The  feel of the establishment is open and chill. The waterfall fountain and plants mounted to the wall gives the place some life.  Now, on to the food. I heard about this healthy pizza notion through a past Yelp event. Curious whether a good pizza could be delicious and low calorie, I stopped in for lunch. Although nothing struck my fancy at first, I ordered the Greek Pizza ($8.99) and sat down to wait for my food. I asked for a cup for water since I saw they had infused water for guests. A faint taste of cucumbers and lemon was refreshing after sweating it out in a hotbed. When my food came out, I was doubting my decision. The crust looked cracker like. After a bite, it was not a disappointment. The thin slices of cucumbers contrasted well with the tomatoes. While the feta and kalamata olives gave bold flavors to an otherwise mellow pie. My pizza was less than 400 calories and satisfying. Instead of leaving here stuffed, it was a nice change of pace. For those lighter days, I would suggest G&P. If I was ravenous, it would probably be a different story.",

    "text": "Not organic enough, not gluten free enough.  A tiny bit vegan friendly as long as you eat any old vegetables, and most vegans don't. We pay attention. My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer \"Not sure\" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI. Still, people who go here seem to be enjoying it and the smoothie though not organic, that I took one tiny sip of, was pretty good. If you're not crazy picky about what you eat you'll love it and if you're a food snob keep driving.",

    "text": "Out with my vegan food companion so options were limited. I assumed we were going to munch sugary lettuce, force down processed fake meats and cheeses and maybe power through weird dense bread. Being in this mindset, Greens and Proteins was a pleasant surprise. Nicely decorated yet still casual. Warning: watering system for the wall plants make a startling sound.  Parking is a piece of cake. It's in the same plaza as the athletic club and starbucks.  The ordering system is like Jason's Deli. Order/pay then they give you a number. Then they bring your food to you. They bus the tables too so don't awkwardly stand holding your refuse while darting your eyes around like I did.  I ordered a small caesar salad. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. It was standard taste. Also had a green ginger limeade. It was a whopping $5.99. It was dense, flavorful, refreshing and pleasant. But the thing I have to come back for are the \"tofu fries.\" They were thick, fried strips of tofu. Not caked in batter. Not oily. Just dusted in spice.   The only downsides were weird meathead customers and it's a little expensive. You should try it!",

The tofu fries were different and interesting too!

Modern in relevant and appealing food the young fit family will want but approachable to families and the older generation without the trendy, cliche power foods of the moment.  Service is friendly and prompt with knowledgeable staff. There is a chef in the house so expect quality and high standards not just teenagers heating up 'healthier' cuisine at your local chain smoothie shop.    My favorite meal items are the bison cheese steak on a Savoy cabbage wrap with tofu fries or the bbq chicken pizza gluten free crust. The smoothies are pricy at about $8 each but you do get very high quality fresh ingredients.  I recommend trying the free cucumber water that is on tap to enjoy.  Hydrating abs pallet cleansing.  G&P is always a great clean eating choice.  Simplicity in healthy offerings done with high standards.",

    "text": "I went here yesterday morning (3/25/12) after a meeting at work got cancelled. I wasn't in the best of mood and my sister wanted to grab a drink at Starbucks. I was craving something different so decided to check out Greens and Proteins because I had remembered seeing it on Yelp.  Ummm... gurrrrl puhleeze. These prices are insanity. There isn't a drink out there that should cost $7+ unless it comes in a solid gold cup. I spent a long time looking over the menu because my family juices a LOT and many of the drinks were things we make at home already, but 5x the price.   The staff was friendly, but I honestly couldn't make up my mind. I settled on the V9, but was a little curious as to why the girl making the drink was using jarred vegetable base, not stock, in the drink. When I asked the girls behind the counter  about the base, they said they didn't know anything about it and just held up the jar for me to see. Flavor bases, pork, chicken, beef and vegetable bases are chock full of partially hydrogenated soybean oil (transfat) and hydrolyzed soy protein (MSG). No bueno. The vegetable base had a Top Ramen flavor packet flavor in the drink.  I was disappointed that the drink was so pricey and I don't have the guts to walk out of a place after I'm there, especially after the staff was friendly. I took a drink of the V9, and was even more disappointed - the flavor and the temperature was not a good combination. Ice cold salty ramen flavor mixed with wheat grass and dried tomato seeds was what I first noticed. I couldn't drink any more of it but thought if I took it home and heated it up, it might make a nice soup. I ended up giving it to my dad, who juices vegetables 3x a day, and he told me not to buy that drink again. He said the cabbage was giving the drink a strange flavor.  As a dietetics student at UNLV, I would love to see this place get rid of the agave syrup (it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, so it's even MORE unhealthy!) As well, I'd love to see them scrap the unfermented soy bean products - that stuff is so toxic and causes so many adverse health problems, specifically in the thyroid and reproductive organs, that it has no business in an establishment that prides itself on being \"healthy.\" (If these things were gone, I would raise my star rating.)  I'd love to see their raw offerings on the menu (it was a line I noticed after I ordered) and to see their drink prices decrease by 2 dollars. Even though they may be a better alternative to Jamba Juice, it really says something when Jamba Juice is considered the affordable alternative. I was sad when I checked in, AFTER to paying, that there was a dollar off coupon for drinks. Agh! frustrating.   The place is pretty and the staff is nice, but the restaurant was empty. As long as the prices are as high as they are, I can't see this being any place other than a splurge treat. I may try this place out again, but I wouldn't reorder the V9.",

You get what you pay for, right? Eh.  This was a stop after yoga - I thought it would be nice to have a low-calorie fruit smoothie to come back to reality before going home and cooking/cleaning.  I ordered the Loaded Antioxidant Chiller - green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, agave nectar (188 cal).  The lady at the cash register seemed pretty indifferent, so I can't say if it was good or bad service. Indifferent service? Sure. It was a bit of a wait for JUST a smoothie when there were only 2 or 3 people ahead of me.  The atmosphere is nice at least - I do enjoy the indoor waterfall wall and natural tables.  Got my smoothie and left.  The taste was good - nothing to really OMG over - but I don't think it was almost $6 something good - and that was with my $1 off Yelp check-in!  I dunno, maybe I need to order food but the prices are a HUGE turn-off.  The yummy pictures of tofu fries may bring me back.  Stay tuned...",

I am not a fan of their jicama fries, I ended up tossing them in the trash. A simple California Grilled Chicken sandwich was one of the most boring things I think I've ever had since I moved to Las Vegas. It was flat out flavorless. The only thing that is saving Greens and Proteins from a 1 star review is their Acai Berry Smoothie and the Green Shake which I would actually go back for. But even their drinks seem to be way overpriced for what you get...and yes I'm aware that it's not cheap to source the stuff that goes into the drinks.   Add in service that was painfully slow along with a not very friendly attitude and I don't see myself gracing their doors again for a long time. Also parking is a pain as the Starbucks next door draws a lot of traffic so the idea of fighting for a space just to get bland food and an overpriced smoothie is not appealing. 2 Stars...but that's only because I'm being nice and want to save 1 Star reviews for places that truly deserve it.",

    "text": "Their lentil veggie burger is okay. I like that I can get it with lettuce instead of having to pay an up charge for gluten free bun. I do wish that a place that describes themselves as healthy would have more gluten free vegan food options that weren't highly processed (gf bun, Daisy cheese). One soup, one wrap & one burger besides salad.   The girl who delivered our food to the table today was great. She came to verify how he wanted his salad & then cheerfully got the crisps that had been left off. I almost gave a 4th star because of her but know she isn't going to be working all their open hours.   They have improved- their tofu fries are now seasoned better & crispier but still not a place to drive out of the way for.",

For the past few months, service has been seriously declining. It's just unacceptable, I'm constantly being offered a comped meal. That's a huge red flag.  So they waited to tell me they were out of ingredients in my meal AFTER bringing out my husbands meal. Why couldn't you tell me that when I ordered my food? The place was dead. It's not like you were too swamped to be aware.  Then when I order something else in exchange, they bring me out a total wrong order. Like are you kidding me? At this point my husband is already done with his meal. I sat through an entire episode of the office waiting to eat at a place that's completely empty. Does that make any sense?  I had to get up to ask for a refund for my meal because I was sick of waiting. The owners (?) were sitting there and had to tell the manager to get up and help me out. The manager offered to comp my next meal. No thanks, I told her not to bother because there won't be a future meal there for us.  I'm just so disappointed because this happens all the time. We have to find a new favorite neighborhood spot unfortunately. Peace out Greens and Proteins.",

    "text": "Healthy and clean living !! Need help well this is where you should eat!  Most think of health food as tasteless and flavorless, that's not the case. Food has evolved and so should we.  Rise up to this new health revolution, bask in its light and make happiness for your mind and body.  We should enjoy eating. Don't be that type of eater that eats food that makes you unhappy. Life is too short so find your inner peace with health food then work from their. That balance between health and happiness is a fine line that I have walked over the past year. I have changed my diet and would not even recognize my old self from a year ago. I have found my happy balance with eating. While at Starbucks one day I discovered this wonderful business one morning. Being about trying new things, one morning for breakfast was all that it took for me to enjoy eating healthy again. Plus a check of my handy yelp app shows how truly happy individuals are that visit here.  The food here is phenomenal and now I see why it's always so busy. The wait times at some points here are ridiculous, but it's worth it. The lobby is very cozy and so clean feeling. I always feel better when I walk into the lobby here it is so uplifting and the service it beyond compare. Having learned their menu now. In the beginning I needed help with some of the terms and explanations on what that it. The real life insight from the crew here has been spectacular. They are so full of life. I'm sure that a lot of it is the food. We truly are what we eat. It shows in how full of life that the crew is here. Vibes are always alive and dazzling amongst the crew. They seem alive and vibrant, not lifeless drones.  Tacos are life. Seeking that place where you can enjoy your tacos and not need to go to the gym afterwards for two hours. You know what I'm talking about. Viola, here it is, but make sure and order those tacos wrapped in crispy, healthy, green lettuce as the shell. Their is the traditional tortilla if you must, but honestly the lettuce wrapped tacos taste so much better. The meat comes in a choice of steak, chicken, or veggies. I went with steak this time and after three street wrapped lettuce tacos I was longing for more. I love the simplicity of the street taco, and while it is healthy they have not complicated it either. The spices on the meat is so sensational the flavors tantalize your tongue. That chipotle sauce that's on top is delicious, but if your not feeling it ask to have it left off. They make all their food to order. No worries.  Breakfast is done too well here. They make these protein shakes. Which I believe that they seem pretty famous for. The green protein one is great and so rich, just full of delicious flavors. The watermelon strawberry is my favorite. The hints of strawberries and watermelon are yummy together. It's a marriage of natural sweet from the strawberry and juiciness from the watermelon. Just insert straw and go. The Acai bowl I have enjoyed on more than one occasion and it never disappoints. Having first discovered this place last summer that Acai bowl is great first thing in the morning right after the gym or a run. It has fresh fruit and Acai to replace what you burned off. The granola provides good carbs to help maintain your energy all day and help you snack less, since you are allowing carbs.  What more could you ask for fresh bananas, blueberries, and strawberries that are available are day long. Good food that is not disappointing and will leave a positive spot in your mind, body, and soul. All someone needs. The crew is fantastic and offers such friendly service all the time. The smiles are genuine and their inner beauty is fierce reality. No wonder so many frequent this business over and over again. For those of us that have fury babies they offer dining on a covered patio with the most comfy chairs outside. Inside the tables look uncomfortable but it's just the opposite. Come and give Taco Tuesday so delicious flavor and bask in the happiness of deliciousness to your health with lettuce wrapped steak tacos. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I am so done with this resturaunt. I have already given them too many chances.   I came in on a Saturday with my boyfriend for lunch.   My goal was to order something healthy. None of the salads are actually vegan so i thought I would substitute a few things. I ordered the g&p chopped salad without meat, cheese and corn. I added cucumber and avocado. The cashier was definitely new, so the woman training him let me know that it would be extra and quite expensive (even though I'm omitting a few things). That's fine, I still order it. I ask the cashier which dressing are vegan and the woman showed him how to find them on the pos system. He then asked, \"is that it?\" So again, I asked \"which dressings are vegan\" (apparently only one, the lemon vinaigrette). We then finalize our order and sit down.   I recieved my salad in a timely manner. However. It was missing the salad dressing. I asked the waiter about it and he said some salads dont come with dressing. I told him I ordered dressing. He comes back with vegan ranch and mayo... for a salad??? *insert confused gif here*  I take the ranch and mayo back to him and say that the vinagarette was vegan. He finally brings that to me.   As I eat my salad I notice there are a lot of ingredients missing, so I check the menu. Sure enough they left out the couscous and artichokes. They bring me a plate of the missing ingredients.  I am so glad I finally got my salad right! Lol. Super disappointing service though. No one apologized or even seemed to care. (Thankfully my boyfriend's food was fine)  I shouldn't have given them another chance since a few weeks ago my boss found a bug in her wrap and they never did anything about it. I have several other friends that had horrible experiences as well.  I will never eat here again.",

I ordered the Angus Cheesesteak on a spinach wrap and boy oh boy, they do not hold off on the toppings like most restaurants.    The toppings include: Ground Angus beef, mozzarella cheese, red bell peppers, button mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and onion.  I got sweet potato fries as my side which is an additional $1.50 and I pulled this straight from their website so no surprises!  The fries were very good and salted just right.  I could literally taste the quality in the beef.  Everything was just so spot on and satisfying.  Unfortunately I didn't get the opportunity to try one of their juices/smoothies.  I just feel they are way pricey, with prices starting at $5.99.  However, the food is definitely something I will be trying more of.",

They have plenty of vegan/vegetarian options and it's not too unreasonably priced. You can order online and just run in to grab it which is awesome when you're on a roll with studying.   I've had a few different things but most recently I had the scrambled eggs with sweet potato mash and pita. It was pretty good but the eggs were definitely missing some seasoning. I don't think there was any? I had to put a lot of hot sauce on the eggs before I was happy with them. But hot sauce is life ya know so it wasn't a real issue.   Overall I like that they have some healthy options and the calories listed next to each item is clutch! Plus, their menu is pretty extensive.",

I ordered a banana split smoothie for my ex and I got the Malibu Breeze and The Impossible Burger which comes with cheese, I also got avocado, some kind of lime mayo and tofu fries which i had never heard of before but thought I should take the chance and see.  The place was super clean, decorated nicely for sure.    Lots of thin people there and me with my fat self wishing I was thinner...Gee, Im off track!  So the banana split smoothie was a bust, ex didnt like it, said it was bland, I tried it and had to agree, no flavor to me, hints of strawberry as you drank it but he really didnt like it.  The Malibu breeze had good flavor but had a sandy texture to it, like it wasnt blended 100%, I understand though, some places like us to chew our smoothies, maybe that is how this place does it, Its not BAD, I wouldnt order it again though....so it wasnt...GOOD...Just OK.  The burger was good but I didnt like the mayo that comes with it and so I used my own veganaise I had at home but good thing I had that on hand...  Probably not going to return + the vegan menu is rather small, for a place that claims to promote good health, should there really be so much non vegan items on the menu?     Just sayin.",

They have a rewards program powered by Thanx. Register a credit/debit card, use that card each time you pay, and the rewards will get sent to your phone.

It has been a long time since I have seen a healthy food establish have so many choices. David suggested getting the Green Ginger Limeade. It was amazing! I was shocked to find that the green grapes was the base. The flavor is a sweet green with a hint of the perfect amount of ginger. I also ordered the grilled vegetable wrap and that definitely gave me that green flavor profile. The flavors were light, but I didn't mind. What I didn't expect was the taste of the jicama sticks. They reminded me of carrots with a little kick.   I also loved the vibe of the place. When I first walked in, I noticed that majority of the store is green with real plants and waterfalls. That's always a calming aspect for me anywhere. The place was also pretty clean and roomy, which I valued a bunch!   Nonetheless, I had a really great first experience at Greens & Proteins.

I really enjoyed the food aside from the gluten issue.  I am excited to try more stuff on the menu and will be sure to ask for the gluten free bun specifically next time.  I recommend the sweet potato fries as well, some of the best I've had.    Ordered take out on the phone. I was told the wrap is gluten free however after I tested it for my fiance I instantly could feel the gluten in the wrap and had to call to verify.  Come to find out the wrap is not gluten free so now I have a meal my fiance can't touch.  So disappointing that something like this ruins a meal because of uneducated staff.",

I also had the pineapple raspberry black tea, since their menu board doesn't tell you that they have regular black and green iced tea available.   The tea was disgusting. They take a ton of unripened fruit and blend it up with a little black tea. It was more like a thin, bitter smoothie than tea with some fruit in it.   Neither of us finished our bowls because they were so bland and boring that we didn't care to eat more. Also, their website says the bowls have asparagus and artichoke hearts, but neither of us got any. Our bowls were both absolutely drowned in bland, runny, oily peanut sauce, which is definitely not shown on the website. Seriously, the oil started separating out of the sauce and left an unappetizing pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl that got bigger as I ate. I can understand going light on the salt since it's a healthy restaurant, but the peanut sauce had no flavor at all. It could really use some ginger, lemongrass, and pepper. We both left hungry because it was so bland that it was hard to keep eating.",

The bison Philly cheese wrap is delicious and the bison burger as well!   The chocolate peanut butter banana shake is so decadent and it's a little pricey (7.50) but the portion size is huge! So it's definitely worth it.   The people there are really nice too! They cooked my moms steak well done and she wanted medium rare and so they made her another one and there was no attitude or anything.   Definitely recommend !",

Turns out its not as \"Healthy\" as it promotes to be and is a bit over priced for the quality of the food. To me, Health= organic. If its not organic its not healthy. I don't want to eat pesticides and chemicals, it defeats the purpose of the nutritious food. I went in a total of three different times ( in case someone didn't know what they were talking about) and I asked each time if any of their items were organic, the response \"NO.\" How is this a healthy place when the food, including veggies and fruits,  are not organic? And why is it so pricey when you're feeding me pesticides, chemicals, and no \"added\" but already there hormones? No thank You.",

It was fairly priced, the staff was helpful and the place was clean. My only quasi-negative is they seem to be a little slow for takeout. However, this is probably them still getting up to speed.   Nice plus = complementary water flavored with citrus and cucumber. It was a nice touch.",

Trust me - you don't need to be a health nut, workout warrior, or calorie-counter to appreciate the great food at this place.   Whether you're bringing along a picky kid, a demanding spouse, a high-maintenance date, or a complainer co-worker, the menu seems to have something for everyone... And the biggest surprise of all? Even my Dad \"the diva diner\" loves Greens & Proteins!   This place is also extremely well-run with the type of customer service we demand and expect here in Las Vegas. Best of all, the most beautiful bodies in the city seem to eat here everyday, giving Greens & Proteins the best \"views\" in the valley.   A few people on \"Yelp\" have complained about the prices, but I honestly don't get where they're coming from. This place is not Taco Bell, folks. You're paying for high quality, great-tasting, healthy food here -- not processed belly fill packed with preservatives that only tastes good when you're hammered or \"high on life.\" For what you get, the prices at Greens & Proteins are very reasonable, in my opinion.  I typically choose the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\" option, where you pair a grain, vegetable, and protein of your choice with your favorite sauce on the side. I usually opt for the bison patty ($12.99) or the chicken breast ($9.99) and always have a hard time deciding which delicious sauce to order (the options are aged balsamic, spicy peanut, citrus BBQ, walnut cilantro pesto, teriyaki, lemon vinaigrette, or tangy buffalo). The Bison Cheesesteak Wrap is also one of my favorite items ($10.99) and I usually see a bunch of them getting ordered during my visits.",

I asked the girl at the register what she recommended and/or the most popular dish, she didn't have much to say except asking me what I was hungry for..  I wanted to know what there top seller was, no answer. At that point another woman interjected and took over my order.   For my husband, I ordered the Turkey Club as a wrap. For myself, I ordered the Grilled Vegetable wrap. I mentioned I eat a lot of grilled vegetable sandwiches, which she replied but you haven't had ours .... I did have it today, and will not be ordering it again. The wrap was soggy.. not much flavor to the vegetables that were not crunchy but overcooked. The beans were tasty along with the cilantro pesto, however there was only a dab or two put on it.   For the sides, with a choice between tofu fries or jicama, I went with something different, tofu fries... different indeed.. I love tofu, but these were shaped like fish sticks and had the seasoning and taste of fish sticks you had as a child (not pleasant) Next time, I'll go for the jicama. The woman that took my order, did say the sauce that you dip them in is good, and yes it was... I ended up putting it on my bland grilled veg. wrap.   I also ordered the Thai Ginger soup, which I was told was made from scratch.  It was flavorful, but could have used some salt to bring out the flavor more.. A little thick for a hot afternoon.   I tasted my husbands Turkey Club and it was tasty. Maybe I'll order that the next time.   The service was nice and friendly.. I will go back and give it another try...  For a first time experience,  today's meal proved to me that if it good for you, then it doesn't taste good.",

But its smoothies are much, much better (and a few more dollars) than my old favorite.   Greens and Proteins uses the real estate that LVAC fills with frozen yogurt and replaces it with fresh kale, grapes, almond milk, avocado, chia seeds, flax seed, agave nectar and collard greens. Can you imagine what these ingredients do for your bowels, Yelpers? They do magic. That's what they do. Magic.  The cucumber and lemon infused water washes away any bad feelings I could have had about the price. Other salves related to pricing: $1 check in offer on Yelp; buy 10 smoothies, get one free; the opportunity to earn the Carrot Top badge.  The flavor of the Green Ginger Limeade juice competes (and almost surpasses) the flavor of the smoothies, yet carries only 129 calories. Again, magic.   As an aside, the bench seat is unusually soft.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I asked for a wrap but I didn't want the spread that came with  and also no added salt. (Yeah I was that person) the cashier was very nice and made it happen for me. The food was great considering the lack of everything that would normally be yummy. The restaurant was clean and tidy. A definite must for any healthy eater.",

I wanted to try it because I heard it was good but the flavor was just ok. I guess I expected better by reading all these great reviews. I think people believe that its more healthy by eating here but are you willing to pay for it? Not healthier because they put extra granola on things!!!There are other places that have better service and quality. I will try other places and don't see myself returning. I will get my juice at Wholefoods.",

Call ahead if you don't want to wait, but they're pretty fast considering the long line at lunch.  You'll see lots of physically fit patrons enjoying lunch or a snack as the gym is right around the corner, so you'll feel good about eating there.    My only issue, and it's not that big of a deal for me, is that the menu is a little pricy.  But you figure the quality and nutrition of the food you are getting, it's not that bad.",

    "text": "This place may be a bit pricier than your average, run of the mill corporate fast food joint but be aware that this is no ordinary establishment and that the extra dollars are well worth it. The quality of the ingredients really speaks for itself and the healthiness, which may be a major selling point for some, was really just a bonus for me.   I opted to try the bison cheese steak on a wheat bun, which seems to be a popular option. It came with a side of \"fries\" and I chose the Jica, having never heard of them before. The girl at the register was friendly and willing to explain the various menu items. Much of the menu is vegan or vegetarian but not all of it-- it offers plenty of options for the carnivores so don't let that deter you from visiting.  The food was pretty impressive. The bun was hearty and filling, and the the actual bison meat was just as tasty as any beef I've ever had in a philly cheese steak. The sandwich itself is filling enough but does come with the fries. I probably will try the tofu fries next time because the jica \"fries\" were really just raw sliced vegetables that provided the optical illusion of fries but tasted nothing like them. The chef who started this place has a great philosophy about making food that is both healthy and delicious and I daresay he has executed it perfectly.  I will definitely be coming back here and hope to try some of the smoothies as well as the wide assortment of salads and sauces.",

I had dinner here on Monday night with a vegan friend and it certainly has that SoCal, clean and green vibe going on.  The staff is super friendly and greeted us warmly as we perused the menu.  I'd already looked it up online prior to arriving and I just cannot believe their smoothies and wellness drinks cost so much!  You need a healthy wallet to drink healthy there!  Even with a Yelp check-in that gives you a $1 off, I still could not justify spending even $6.50 for a smoothie.  So, I went with the turkey club in a wheat wrap with tofu fries.  The wrap was great and the tofu fries were...interesting.  I just kept wishing they were real fries, but I did say I TRY to eat healthy.  My friend had the vegan pizza and she loved hers, but she also is a regular customer and has a much healthier wallet than I do.  I find it interesting that this joint which promotes health and wellness also advertises that it has an HCG-friendly menu--isn't HCG unsafe, illegal, and not approved by the FDA?  Anyway, overall, if you're vegan, vegetarian, or want to take a walk on the healthier side, come to Greens and Proteins.  They certainly live up to their name!",

My friends trust that if I review a place and it get's five stars it must be great.   I have only been here a handful of times, but this by far is my favorite health food hangout now and will be checking in many times. You will see many campers with computers because it offers free wi/fi. I might start bring my laptop.   What I love about this place; I can build my own meal for 10 bucks. I order either chicken breast or the Filet. The chicken breast is so juicy and seasoned nicely for about 8 bucks. Filet is cooked to order and is amazingly good for 15 bucks. Now each build your own meal comes with a generous portion of a veggie and a gain. I do the broccoli and brown rice. No sauce for me. But sauce is available.  Don't let me review fool you into thinking it is just builder your own meal. They have one of the best tasting health pizzas in town (i order the gluten free crust).  Honestly if someone can show me better I am up for the challenge.    And of course the have the traditional health juices and wraps.  The coolest thing about this place is the water jug next to the soda fountain. Fresh Lemons and Cucumbers added to filter water. It is so good! Ask for a cup at check-out it is free.   OK friends go and try this place and let me know what you think :-)",

The menu boasts a wide range of choices without being overwhelming.  I had the bison burger with the fried tofu and a green ginger limeade to drink.  The bison burger was cooked perfectly; juicy and flavorful.  The fired tofu was excellent--I never thought bean curd could be made to taste so good--I had to remind myself I was actually eating tofu.  And the green ginger limeade was surprisingly tasty--light with a hint of ginger; not too sweet at all.  I will definitely be back to try the ostrich burger and fried jicama.",

(Don't get me wrong, there is some great food on the Strip.) We did lunch here while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive at the airport - Harvest Kale and Chicken Quinoa salads. Both were excellent - and huge - along with two very good smoothies. We did breakfast on day two with the protein pancakes and the roasted vegetable fritatta. Again, excellent on all counts. The only hit is they didn't have coffee (broken machine), but we just jumped on a latte at the Starbucks next door.",

I had the california chicken wrap and chose a lettuce wrap instead of wheat. The dipping sauce it came with was very good. I do think that the wrap could have been seasoned better. For the side, the choice was between tofu fries and jicama sticks. I chose the tofu fries and quite liked them. Also tasted the jicama a friend had chosen and it was good too. And their water is infused with cucumber and lemon and is YUM!  Everyone liked their food. I believe the 'wellness' drink was great and tasted amazing. Everything from salmon to greek pizza looked so healthy and tasted great.",

    "text": "One aspect I really enjoy about restaurants is when they are immaculately clean. Everything was spotless and organized. There are plenty of seats outside the patio if the weather is nice, & inside it's very spacious, with trendy tables, a nice wall backdrop with running water, & several televisions. Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either.  If you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!) The menu is definitely a little more healthier than your fast-food alternatives, with wraps, pizza, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, juices, the works. The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter).   I purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing!   Walking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!",

You have the option to have your pizza crust as low cal lavash, gluten free crust or pita. Also you can have vegan cheese (nope, I will never order vegan cheese). Definitely the favorite menu item is the tofu fries. Crisp and well seasoned. I had the turkey burger with tofu fries last time I was here and it was sheer perfection. The smoothies are yummy and jam packed with nutrients. Also they have wifi which was helpful when I used to have to study. Definitely a good place to go and not feel guilty afterwards and still feel as if you had a filling meal!",

When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal.   We asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said \"yogurt\" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl.   This point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part.   I would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of \"sauce\", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap.   Vegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were \"snaked\" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal.",

I appreciate the quality of ingredients and having a place to eat at on the go and I don't have to feel guilty or worry about how it's made.  My last few visits, I realized how boring and uninspired their food is. It's dull and lackluster. It's almost everything I dislike about clean eating.  G&P offers healthy/raw/healthy versions of classic foods: burgers (beef, ostrich, turkey, veggie, etc.), pizza, salads, wraps. They're vegan, Paleo, Gluten-Free, Raw, vegetarian, HCG, and carnivore friendly. Anything good made there, I can make at home for way less, and have several servings.  I'm really mixed up about this. It very much has its pros and it's cons. Vegas doesn't have a lot of guilt-free dining options, so it's refreshing, service is great, it's always clean, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgable.   I'm torn. Will I continue to give them my patronage? Yes. The advice I offer them is to start thinking outside of the box. Please?  Food is prepared well.  It's so simple and uninspired. How about doing something like, The Pinterest Clean Eating Recipe of the Week or some shit? Come on G&P!  Pro-tip: Get those tofu fries and whatever sauce they're served with! Amaze balls!",

The Bison was cooked well, soft and great comparison with the cheese and spinach wrap. A great filling and healthy option. The Tofu fries were a bit lacking in flavor and had an oily/greasy taste. The decor is well green and very natural and outdoorsy. Very relaxing and Zen ambience! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.",

Or it's a perfect if you are feeling guilty after a few days of indulging. I was in Vegas on business and found this place a few miles from where I was staying. Now, I would say not to come here if you are ravenous because the portions are just right to be filling, but definitely aren't huge. The menu is a mixture of smoothies, juices, burgers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and custom plates. I got a custom plate with tofu, asparagus, spaghetti squash, and peanut sauce. It was pretty good and the price was reasonable. They don't flavor the vegetables at all and put the sauce on the side, so you are free to do what you want. On the plate, it looks kind of small but I left with a full, happy belly! And the employees were super friendly,  which is always a plus!",

They have \"tofu fries\" which I had not encountered yet, basically crispy tofu strips that they serve with a tasty dipping sauce. Seriously, you need to try this place if you are trying to eat a certain way or just want a more health conscious option. They break down menu items nutrition info, which is helpful to those on a diet. Staff are cool...I guess I'm gonna give it a five star review now, I didn't really write anything bad....well bowled Greens and Protein.",

BOY, was I wrong!  Came here one morning after my roomie and I finished working out.  Love how bright and sunny it is in there. Like it should be a cafe in LA or an Asian boba spot where there's lime green and yellow furniture everywhere.  I ordered the veggie sandwich as I looooooooooove grilled veggies. It came with a pickle and I ordered the tofu fries as it's side. I like tofu but, after trying it this way and with a spicy aiole, I LOVE TOFU FRIES!  My roomie had the Greek pizza. I love feta but, the kalamata olives were toooo over powering. My roomie had to take them outta his pizza; and he loves olives.  Checking into Yelp gave me a 50 cent off voucher on their shakes or juices so, we decided to get one. I forget which one but, it was delicious. Peanut buttery but, not toooo thick. More like an icee texture.  Already love my salads and veggie snacks but, this place makes them so much more tastier and in a way that I don't normally eat them.",

I get there around 1:00-1:30 pm and it seems as they just cooled down from lunch hour. Anyways so I order a chicken teriyaki sandwich with cheese and grilled onions added. I usually pay around 13$ for this. This time they charged me almost 15$ I was shocked but I rolled with it and requested the receipt. Later when I looked at the receipt I saw they charged me $2.00 for some grilled onions rather than the usually $0.50. So I'm sure it was a mistake so I take it up to the cashier and she fixes the issue for me and refunds me the difference. So here I am now waiting on my food for almost twenty minutes which also wasn't a big deal because I wasn't in a rush. However once I receive my food it's just disappointment. I got a cold chicken sandwich with no cheese and no grilled onions. (What I paid extra for) and to top it off my sweet potato fries were cold and barely edible. Overall it was an upsetting meal.",

A little self control is required!  I promise, you will eat again so keep the splurging to a meal or two a week. Luckily in Vegas there are lots of healthy places to stop and eat and not feel guilty. I mean I can think of 4 or 5 just on Eastern!  Greens and Proteins can fill your stomach with some high quality fuel and make your taste buds jump for joy all while making sure you look good for the pool party season.   The salads are awesome and you can add really good salmon for a protein boost. The lettuce wraps are always a light healthy meal. Their juices are good but for me I ask them to leave some of the fruit out as I don't want as much sugar.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  You can get in and out quickly for breakfast, lunch or dinner or you can also choose to sit and enjoy a great meal and conversation. I love sitting outside and feeling the wonderful Vegas warmth in the evenings. Enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful.   We all love to eat but we all also want to be healthy and look great. We all like convenience and most of us don't have time or desires to cook three meals a day.  This place can help you live the life you want while eating healthy and enjoying your food.   Eat to live, but live to experience life.  Aaron",

What I'm trying to say is that it can be hard and an inconvenience to eat healthy especially if you don't have the time to cook at home. Now with greens and proteins all that ends! They have a HUGE menu with lots of options! All nutritional facts are listed on everything they offer! Fast service! With a fantastic ambience!! Food is delicious!! And doesn't make you feel groggy after you eat it!! The only issue I see is that it can be a tad bit expensive at times!

I came back two days later with a friend and ordered the bison cheesestak wrap with tofu fries. That dish gets five stars. I could not believe I was eating something so sinful tasting but good for me and half the calories of the real thing. My friend had the buffalo chicken strips and they were really good. The next week I went in with another friend and we both tried the summer berry salad...WOW! I went back again this past weekend for the green shake. I cannot get enough of this place. I am going for lunch again today with a new friend. Whenever I find something I love I have to share with everyone.

    "text": "It actually makes me very sad that I'm writing this because I was so looking forward to finding a good healthy place to eat. Everyone was really friendly, from the cashier to the manager, and their customer service was excellent. I can't say the same about the food. First off, I ordered the \"wellness juice\" which isn't a juice at all, I watched the girl prepare it throw vegetables into a blender and it was this disgusting, warm slush of liquid-y vegetables. I'm a green juice hound, and I don't know why they market their drinks as \"juices\" if they're more like slushed-up smoothies? The smoothie-thing had a horrible aftertaste like the vegetables had gone bad, and I only took one sip before throwing it in the trash. Secondly, I ordered an albacore salad which was literally a lump of canned tuna thrown on top of a bed of lettuce. I don't know who decided to call this thing a salad but it's definitely not what most people would consider to be a salad. The lump of canned tuna and lettuce bed was horribly tasteless and the lettuce was wilted and soggy. It makes me so sad that I didn't find what I was so hopeful to find in greens and protein. I was really excited to find my new favorite healthy cafe. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the employees were really friendly & helpful. But unfortunately, the horrible food was a dealbreaker for me, and I won't be a returning customer.",

It has a cute modern decor, all the meals have caloric value listed, and the food is fresh.  Yes, it may be a little pricer for a lunch place but I think you get what you pay for.  I had the greek pizza and it was DELICIOUS.  Cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, olives, and a little bit of sauce and boom - flavor in your mouth.  I highly recommend this place.  Looking over at my neighbors dishes, it makes me interested to try more!  There's so much to choose from.",

    "text": "Awful experience here today.  I work in the Las Vegas service industry so I am fully aware of service standards. When I walked in at 4:30pm there was no one in line.  I knew what I wanted to order so I went straight to the register to place my order (1 Apple Pie Smoothie).  The two female employees prepping ingredients continued to chit chat with themselves, not acknowledging my presence for a full minute of standing at the register.  Finally one came over and took my order, my name, and payment.  The other employee started working on my smoothie.  I watched her pour in almond milk and then dump at least a CUP of nutmeg in my smoothie and gasp 'Oh my God' to the other employee.  (A little sprinkle of nutmeg goes a long way).  The two of them decided it best her her to  scoop the nutmeg out with her gloved hands.  Unsuccessfully, she decided to start my smoothie over (thankfully, as I watched her like a hawk, regretting having just paid $8 for a smoothie).  Meanwhile the other employee helped the two customers behind me as I watched employee 1 take her sweet a$$ time re-making my smoothie.  The other employee managed to make FOUR other smoothies (for customers behind me) in the time it took employee 1 to make one smoothie.  This all took about approx 10 minutes.  Then, employee 1 tried to give my smoothie away to another customer behind me.  I finally walked up and said, \"that's for (my name), right?\" \"Oh oops, here you go!\" was her response to me.  No 'sorry about the 10 minute wait'.  Sorry Greens & Proteins, no matter how hungry I am and how hard it is to get a healthy snack when I'm all the way across town, I will faithfully use my own Blendtec at home and make better, cheaper smoothies.  And I\"ll make sure to tell my friends.",

My brother got the build your own meal, and the tuna was not cooked properly, no flavor and very small portions. I got the chicken wrap and it was really good but hot damn they are pricey. I got the leafy berry smoothie...was not that good and really?? Almost $8.00?! If you are going to spend that god awful amount on a smoothie or juice get the green wellness or whatever its called, it tastes better.

The bun tasted alright, and was a nice consistency. G&P's vegan mayo had a buttery flavor and texture reminiscent of garlic butter which would have been a nice touch had the burger been more flavorful.  The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu, and gave my table the wrong food then gave it to the correct table after we had touched it. A table mixup is absolutely understandable but not taking the food back is problematic. The server only took it from the other table after we flagged her down to alert her.   This was my first time at this establishment so maybe it was an off order but it's not the kind of experience that will bring me back.",

    "text": "Good Smoothies and Juices but ehh on the salads and over priced.  I guess if you stick a healthy label on a restaurant you would always expect to pay high prices.   What I do like are the juices and smoothies as their made from real fresh ingredients. The last time we were here we ordered the \"Green Shake\"; \"Green Ginger Limeade\" and the \"Albacore Tuna Salad\"  The \"Green Shake\" comes with Banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Sounds like they put the kitchen sink in this shake but you can taste hints of every ingredient. You get a dose of fruits and vegetables and an added extra protein burst with the almonds. You can substitute this for a meal as it's very filling.   The \"Green Ginger Limeade\" comes with Green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, agave nectar. Its a very refreshing drink and its not filled with a bunch of sugars. One of the things I love about this drink is the ginger. It does not overpower the drink as it adds a unique sweetness.   The \"Albacore Tuna Salad\" comes with Tomatoes, celery, cucumbers and bibb lettuce, Dijon dressing. Now this was such a big disappointment. My thoughts ordering this was I was going to get seared tuna on top of greens but to my surprise it was canned tuna and the large size was priced at 9.99. I felt like I just got ripped off. The dressing was also a little too strong with the Dijon but at least it killed the taste of the canned tuna.   I would definitely come back for the Juices and Smoothies but would hesitate to order another salad. There are other selections available on the menu like pizzas and burgers that I might try next time.",

Even though the smoothies are good and if you check in you get a $1 off from Yelp but when it comes to the dishes at the end of the meal your still hungry. I honestly wish there was a native foods I would be there everyday!  PROS: Food and service CONS: Overpriced and small portion sizes",

    "text": "This place has the potential to be good, however, they keep coming up short.  I agree with some other comments about the staff.  This place does not have a staff on the A game.  C to D at best.  To have trust and faith in a place, it really needs to start with the person taking the order to hit the right keys and input your order correctly.  It's not rocket science and no one is being rushed, so to get your order wrong is just a sign of incompetence.    We have been here 3 times now and have had bad experiences.  The first bad experience was the wrong smoothies being made.  The second time, the smoothies were not made properly.  We got close to what we ordered, but the people just seem to be too inexperienced.    Now the third time, they advertise to be HCG and Vegan friendly, however, the chef and owner are not Vegans, and have not read a Vegan cook book.  Hint, hint, maybe will help becoming more familiar with what you are advertising.  This place is still kind of new, but you should have a clue before you make a claim and advertise that you are friendly to people's needs.  Again, the order was put in wrong at the register which cause the entire experience to go nowhere but down, which is sad.  This place has a LOT OF POTENTIAL, as I said in the beginning and I would love to see this place succeed if the owners and chef have the ability to tighten up their ship and get things right.  With all the holes in their staff, which leads to bad experiences by customers, ships full of holes only go in be direction, down.....as of now, I cannot give this place any more then 2 stars.  We will probably give hem one last chance before we write them off completely, I just hope they stay in business long enough for this to happen.",

I elected to try a protein shake here today and skip the Las Vegas Athletic club whey drink I normally get. The line was long and the dining area was packed. The staff was quick and friendly. I ordered a peanut butter banana smoothie which was chalk full of veggies,peanuts,raisins etc. I elected almond milk as well. The price was reasonable and I received my smoothie really quick.   As for the taste... Less to be desires but good for being healthy. I would order a different shake next time. The texture was too gritty for me. I prefer my smoothies.. Well smooth!   The food looked amazing and smelled great. Everyone eating seemed to love the food. I was impressed with the menu and hope to go back soon and try a bison burger! Yum!!!",

I got the buffalo cheese steak sandwich with tofu fries [yes tofu]. Super good!  Went back and ordered their combo which consists of pick your: protein, grain, veggie, sauce.  I got shrimp, brown rice, asparagus, and pesto sauce.  Has calories displayed everywhere so you know exactly what's going in. Also, got a spinach and almond milk shake [sounds gross but it was amazing!!!!!]  Priced around $10 shake was like $4 but HEY you are eating healthy.  Decor is awesome with running water on the walls and bright green chairs.    My only suggestion: salad bar or make your own salad. Pick your lettuce, pick your protein, pick your toppings, pick from an array of low fat house based dressings?????  Something like a salad expressions??? That'd be awesome. Adding Elk to the menu would rock too!!!",

    "text": "My friend had been wanting to check out Greens and Protein, so I decided to join in for dinner.   The place is cute and very modern with a green and fresh-looking atmosphere. I opted for the bison burger with tofu fries. The food arrived quickly and it didn't do much for me visually. The burger was cooked decently, but the flavors were lacking. Everything was a little bland. I love tofu, but the fries were rubbery and the jicama fries I tried from my friend's plate were ok. I usually like jicama a lot, but these were overly vinegary and not what I was hoping for when I bit in. Most others seemed to agree since most people were dumping a majority of their fries in the trash that I saw.   The burger was solid, but nothing else really hit home for me. I appreciate the \"healthy\" food they seem to pride themselves in here, but I'd have to try more to see if there's anything that really hits the spot for me.",

    "text": "It's been a while since my first visit, but the food was still just as great during my second visit. I like the healthy eating options, the large menu, and simplicity.   Turkey Club ($9.99): Sliced turkey, turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and Russian dressing on a whole wheat hoagie. Added sweet potato fries for $1.50. Decent sandwich, however, not a lot of flavor. I added some S+P and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) and it improved significantly. Sweet potato fries were good.  Bison Burger ($10.99): Grilled Bison burger, vegan cheese, and LTO on a whole wheat bun. Side of tofu fries. I believe they use Daiya vegan cheese, which I loooove! Plus, it's available at no extra charge! Again, very little flavor as you need to add your own condiments and seasoning, but you can do it to your liking. This was delicious! The patty was tender and cooked just the way I wanted (medium rare). Plus, the tofu fries are awesome!   Extra Lean Certified Angus Beef Burger ($9.99): This is also grilled and accompanied by LTO. I added avocado and chose lettuce bibb for a low-carb option. Another great burger!  The best part of their menu are all the choices and options. I was delighted that they have a vegan cheese option for burgers at no additional cost. The burgers, sandwiches, and wraps can be paired with whole wheat buns/hoagies/wraps, spinach wraps, and protein-style options like Bibb lettuce or cooked cabbage. Everything is so customizable and they have so many options to fit several diet needs. There is also a build-your-own-meal section.",

    "text": "I've been to this location 3x's a week. Enough to see the pros and cons. I've also been to the Rainbow location to compare the difference between the two. I always get my usual and there is a difference in consistency between the two. Both places are good overall but the one thing that stands out between them is the customer service.   I love their turkey chili but every bite has a 1:10 ratio of turkey and beans. I felt like the beans was the main course. Please change your recipe to add more turkey! I know it sounds a bit silly to make such a request but who would want to eat a spoon full of beans when the name is called turkey chili.   The batch they make is already pre-made. Everytime I've asked for light on the beans at the Rainbow location they made the effort to make me a batch of where they hand scoop out the extra beans for me for no extra charge. I tipped well as a thank you. It was amazing and I was very happy. It still looked and tasted like their original. (This location is next to my corporate office. I'm assuming they have better customer service to please the business professionals.)  This Eastern location, the chef didn't even care to try. They said they would have to charge me for an extra turkey patty. I basically had to pay $7.00 for a chopped up hamburger patty that's thrown on top of my chili. Not even mixed in for me. *image attached* It looked lazy. I had to bring it back and let them know I paid basically $14.50 for half a cup of chili with a patty thrown on top. I had to ask for a second cup of at least a bit of extra chili since I did paid in full for it.  Little situations like these are the details that makes a business good to great.",

My go-to item on the menu is the veggie pizza, with vegan cheese and gluten free crust. It never disappoints and is far better tasting than a lot of greasy, fatty pizzas I've tried. Healthy and tasty, I'd say that's a win win! I will continue to return every time I get the urge to indulge in pizza, simply because I won't have to suffer the guilt, or bloat. Not to mention, everything else on the menu is awesome...salads, smoothies, juice, and so forth. Whatever it is, you really can't go wrong!",

The portions for both are hefty and I left feeling so stuffed.  And overwhelmed with how high the quality of food was.  they have so many nutritious options to choose from and all their drinks seem super appealing. This is the kind of place that you can go to for breakfast, lunch, dinner & dessert.  It's an all around great little joint if you're feeling like you can go for some greens and a more wholesome range of foods.    Service was quick.  Received my food pretty fast and I was able to devour it that much quicker.  Everyone working there seemed pretty nice too.    The price of the food here is reasonable because you're paying for some good quality food.. So of course, it's going to be priced a bit higher than other fast food places.  But really- it's worth it.",

There's a good selection of smoothies and the Green Shake is another one of my favorites.  This location has indoor and patio seating available. Indoor usually is more quiet (I sometimes even do work here) and the patio is next to Starbucks' patio which is a bit loud but still adds to the atmosphere.

Inside, mini waterfalls are against the wall with lime green chairs and white tables. It looks pretty clean and well-maintained, except for the dusty fake plants by the booths (yuck!). The young woman at the cash register was a bit unfriendly, but one of the guys behind the counter talked to us while we waited, which made the experience a little better.   Anyway, our group ordered: the lean angus beef burger, a teriyaki grilled chicken (wheat) wrap and the bison cheese steak (spinach) wrap.  The teriyaki grilled chicken wrap was filled with lean chicken, and definitely had more of a garden-y taste because of the fresh veggies in it. There wasn't a strong teriyaki taste, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. The jicama fries that I ordered with it weren't really that appealing. It was tasteless and watery, so it didn't really make me want to finish them off. I guess I should've just ordered the tofu fries instead.   The bison cheese steak was the better of the two wraps (or maybe that's just my inner fat kid talking)... but I didn't see how it was healthy because it was dripping with oil. I'm not that disappointed with it because it was still pretty flavorful!  They had complimentary cucumber/lemon infused water, which is really refreshing especially in the summer heat.   Portions may look small to some, but it was surprisingly filling. You should definitely check it out if you're on the more health conscious side of eating out.",

Love the bison cheesesteak with sweet potato fries.  The bison is so lean but flavorful.  Packed with peppers and onions in a spinach wrap.  The cucumber water is light and refreshing.  The prices are similar to other comparable places.   Must try if your looking for something clean and healthy.",

They offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free choices, plus animal for those who are so inclined.  The bright green color scheme is still overwhelming for my eyes. They had 2 tvs to keep you occupied. Lots of seating inside and a few tables outside. When I came in on a Saturday around 11- it was pretty quiet but the dining area was pretty messy. A lot of tables with crumbs and food items and the floor was dirty as well.  My veggie burger was way over cooked. It was dark brown and really crunchy. Hard to finish it because it was pretty dry.  Went today and had the mock chicken wraps. They were so salty. I couldn't even finish them.  Staff was friendly and professional.",

The juices and smoothies are fantastic as well. Made from scratch right in front of you from whole fruits and veggies.  Veggie Flatbread: Really tasty. They use unconventional veggies that normal wouldn't be on a veggie pizza. Artichoke hearts, Greek and black olives, spinach, orange bell peppers and classic red onions.    Buffalo Chicken Flatbread: Right up my man's alley. Although there isn't a ton of buffalo sauce flavor, it's more of a BBQ chicken pizza, it's still scrumptious. Make sure you ask for ranch. It's a Greek yogurt ranch but it's so good. And guilt-free.   Ginger Limeade Juice: I get this every time I go there. It's so light and refreshing. And a green drink so who can complain?    I'll be frequenting this place often and definitely adding to my review with different menu items. Also I'd like to add that the restaurant was super accommodating to my dog on the patio. They gave him water in a cup and everything. So nice!",

I usually get one after the gym or when I'm fighting back that burrito craving. Greens and Proteins offers multiple smoothies options: Green Shake, Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana shake and something called the Apple Pie... the list goes on, but you get it, right?   I'VE TRIED BOTH:  The Green Shake & its Chocolate mutant counterpart.   The Green Shake is delicious. Filled with banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. This beast will definitely curb hunger cravings, but won't leave you feeling overstuffed and gross. Great smoothie for the Green and Protein curious but isn't sure about all this weird healthy food business. Not only is this drink tasty, but the super silky texture is a great way to smooth out a rough day. Ha!   The Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake is for the person who needs to be tricked into eating \"healthy\". This drink, with over 700 calories, comes fully equipped with cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This is definitely a meal substitute and should be treated as such. This one is actually my favorite (duh) because I drink this instead of eating a heavy lunch, but it also does what it's supposed to do, fill you up.   I'm a big dude, so if these smoothies can tide me over until my next feeding, than I'm sure the twiggy masses will be set for days. Keep it smoothie!",

Love the fact that the company has lots of meatless options and healthy earth conscious meats.  We got three smoothies and drinks  1. Tofu and banana split (no agave can't stand it) 5/5 2. Wellness drink so good, green with a hint of nirmeg 5/5 3. Green-leaf berry blast. Not that good weird off flavors all 3 of us tried and didn't like it 2/5 4.

I should have went with the alternative, yucca fries.

I walked in and the main color is earth tones and green. They have a kitchen/juice bar open for you to see everything being freshly made.  Clean white counter tops. The tables look like tree trunks. You can sit inside or outside. Very hipster scenery with people grabbing smoothies/coffee while sitting and doing work, having a meeting, etc. People bring their dogs and just relax outside for hours.  My friend and I shared a meal. The lady taking our order seemed the least interested in her job. I was shocked on how someone in just a bland mood could work at such an inspiring lifestyle restaurant. I even asked her for an extra cup, so I could split our smoothie, and gave off an attitude I was asking too much. But her mood was not going to put a damper on my experience. She handed us our # and we proceeded to sit outside to enjoy the day.  My friend and I got a wellness smoothie which was very green but a hint of sweet. This was perfect because I hate sweet. You could taste all the fresh veggies in it.  We also got the veggie burger with the fried tofu fries. The veggie burger was on a wheat bun with onions, tomato, and lettuce (not gross iceberg lettuce). You can do cheddar or swiss cheese or make it vegan and get no cheese. If you got here, YOU MUST try the tofu fries. They are like a steak fry thickness, deep fried with a cajun seasoning. They bring a spicy mayo our but I prefer ketchup.  We sat outside enjoying the beautiful natural sunlight and cool breeze. Our waiter was very polite and brought out food out. He was quick to clean up when we were done. You do not feel pressured to leave but just relax. The waiter saw a lady with a dog working and brought the dog a water bowl. I thought is was a wonderful act of kindness. I will definitely be coming back.",

Their tofu home fries convinced me that tofu wasn't as evil as I have previously experienced!  The service is what I would compare to a Panera or other sit down/fast food place. You walk in, order at the counter, they give you a number to set at your table, then they bring you you meal.   Service was fast & friendly and the staff was friendly and knew their stuff despite looking young (must be all that healthy food!). They don't do delivery, but you can call ahead and then pick up your order.   The food was clean, healthy and they had plenty of Gluten Free options (bread & pizza crust) to choose from and their was no guilty aftertaste!",

The place is located in a very high traffic plaza and it can get pretty packed during lunch. Inside of the restaurant is very well done. The interior has a very sleek, modern and clean look. The menu is fairly simple, and the calories are added next to each item on the menu (major bonus). The staff was fairly friendly albeit a bit rushed even though it was not very busy on that particular day.   I opted for the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken wrap with a side of Jicama fries. Everything was very delicious.  The less calories conscious boyfriend opted for Turkey BLT wrap with tofu fries. The wrap was just ok. It needed some sort of a light sauce or marinade  to infuse the exceedingly dry turkey. This would be a forgivable,  if this wrap was not $10.99. He ended up finishing my wrap of which he was a huge fan. I absolutely LOVED the tofu fries. SO good! The lunch was not cheap, but that is expected at a place that serves healthier options, and by nature of the business incur higher direct and indirect costs. Also, by choosing this particular location to open shop, the business has found its niche. Let's hope for the best. I will be back for sure, just not sure when or how frequently.",

I couldn't imagine a cheese steak wrap, let alone a bison, but once I took a bite...mmmmm was all that I hummed.  I have to say, as a wrap I couldn't even eat everything.  As a matter if fact I saved the other half for dinner.  I could not decide between the tofu fries or the jicama fries so I was able to go half half.  They both were good, but I did favor the tofu fries.  I think I might order that as a side by itself too.  This seems to be a pretty bust place, the whole time we were there, there was always a line. But it moves quick.  The servers, if you dine in, are quick and pleasant when serving and taking away your plates.

    "text": "I selected Greens and Proteins (G&P) because I wanted a tasty, wholesome breakfast with no animal protein.  In short, I was not impressed with this establishment and its offerings. It seems to me that they are offering a watered down version of \"healthy\" food.  EXPERIENCE: I struggled with their juice menu first. I juice and drink fresh juices from other establishments on a regular basis so I felt comfortable picking out a quick juice to start my meal. Unfortunately, agave nectar and honey were featured in all but one drink.   I can get added sugar anywhere in town, I was surprised that a place that calls itself a \"healthy kitchen and juice bar\" offered no pure juices. And that what they were presenting as juice was laden with a sweetener more processed than high fructose syrup (agave).   Needless to say, I chose the V9 juice since it offered some vegetable and contained no added sugar.  I asked for more greens (spinach and kale) in the juice with regular tomatoes rather than the sun dried tomatoes usually in the drink. The addition of vegetable stock to the juice was confusing for me. I saw them add a processed vegetable broth, not a stock, but that didn't bother me too much. I have never seen a juice offering with vegetable \"stock\", but I was willing to try it.  The \"juice\" was more of a blended concoction.  It was cold and thickish.  Especially as I got the end. What is was not, was tasty.  There was no bite from the lime or garlic and the \"stock\" watered down the taste of the vegetables. The texture and flavor were off putting, but I'd spent the $6.99 for 24 oz. (8oz of that are the vegetable broth) so I drank it. Most of it.  My mother ordered the Greek scramble with a side of the homemade turkey bacon. I ordered the \"Real Deal Oatmeal\" with some of the additions (raisins, bananas, and \"sucant\", which is sugar) on the side. The menu lists \"sucant\" as an ingredient in the oatmeal, but I believe G & P has misspelled the word Sucanat on their menu. Sucanat is a whole, unrefined cane sugar made by \"crushing sugar cane, extracting the juice, heating it, and dehydrating it into granules.\" It's still sugar, but many people consider it a healthier option because it contains less sucrose and \"retains the natural molasses and trace nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, and B vitamins.\"  I've ordered oatmeal at dozens of establishments in this town--most not presenting the image of a health conscious establishment---and I've never heard what I heard from G&P.  After ordering, the cashier had to come over and find me to tell me that they could not put the sugar (Sucanat) on the side.  \"Why\" I asked. She explained that the sugar is mixed in with the oatmeal. What??? I clarified in case I had misheard her.  I asked incredulously, \"The sugar is already mixed in with the oatmeal? So I can't get oatmeal without sugar?\" Correct.  She informed me that they pre-mix the sugar in the oatmeal.  To put this issue in context, a person can order rolled oats oatmeal at McDonald's without sugar.  How do they know how much sugar (Sucanat) I want in my oatmeal?   I imagine they err on the side of \"a lot.\"   All of the other breakfast options included animal protein or sugar except for the Berry Parfait. I ordered it without the strawberry yogurt since I assumed that it had more sugar than I would like. I asked for plain yogurt in the parfait. The chef happened to be out on the floor and the cashier (misunderstanding my request?) asked the chef what was in the strawberry yogurt. He stated that it was plain yogurt with strawberries and sweeteners added.  I don't eat pre-sweetened yogurt and figured the strawberries and sweetened granola would add enough sugar to the meal. He said they had plain yogurt in the back and that they could accommodate me.   The parfait was fine--lots of large strawberries and sweet crunchy granola.  I tasted one of Mom's tofu fries and it was crunchy and well seasoned. She enjoyed her egg white scramble and turkey sausage side.  I understand everyone visiting G & P will not share my expectations. If people are looking for a place with some vegetables and some healthier options, this place is solid.  I love that they have a raw section on their menu. I also appreciate the lean meats on their menu that are not easy to find elsewhere: bison and ostrich.   SERVICE: Great service. They did a fantastic job of accommodating me.  SUMMARY: Greens and Proteins seems a decent option for those on a plant-based diet looking for restaurant options, those seeking non-certified gluten free options,  or those looking for more generally healthy food options.   It was not a good place for me. When I patronize a \"healthy\" establishment, I am seeking whole foods, less refined sugars and grains, great taste, few if any processed foods, and greater raw (and cooked) vegetable options. I do not think I will return to Greens and Proteins.",

We ordered the G&P breakfast burrito, egg whites with sausage, and the whole grain pancakes. The burrito lacked any kind of flavor and was very wet. It was literally laying in a pool of liquid. I didn't try the sausage for the eggs but my stepson didn't care for them at all...once again no flavor. The pancakes were the best out of the three, but were kind of on the dry side. I didn't mind but my significant other doused them on extra syrup.  I will try this place again, just not for breakfast. Maybe come back around lunch time bc that menu looked great.",

If you go for lunch, it is best to get there early during the week as it gets pretty busy. At the weekend, it's a great choice for brunch or evening meal and not too crowded. There is outside seating available, too.",

    "text": "OMG... I was in food heaven! :)  My friend and I decided to give this place a try because we were hearing such good things about it and about their vegan options.  So this what we ordered and shared:  1st dish:  Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome.  The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty.  I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good.  The chorizo was da bomb!  The dish even came with tofu nuggets, which was amazing too.  They really need to add tofu nuggets as an appetizer.  I could eat that all day... just pop it in my mouth.  2nd dish: Granola toasted french toast... ok i must admit, that it wasn't  vegan because of the type of whole wheat bread that they used.. but it was all good with me cuz they didn't use egg to coat the granola to the bread.... so i just decided to try it.  It was delish!!!  The granola was mixed in with nuts, and raisins...mmm, mmm, mmm.  I felt like my breakfast turned into a dessert, but at the same time, it just tasted healthy. :)   this place is like halfway between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant... but to my surprise the dishes were visual appearing.  They took time to make it look pretty and presentable.   I was so hungry and the food looked so good, that I didn't take any pictures of my food.   I also think that the dishes are reasonably priced.  We paid less than $20 for both dishes....I love paying $20 or less for 2 people when I go out to eat.  Hey, when the food is good and the price is right, then that's an awesome deal.    I will go back for sure and order more off the vegan menu and try to take pics of it before I feed my face.  I recommend you try this place out and your taste buds will say thank you.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago I went here on a Sunday evening because the Starbucks next door was packed. My friend and I were just looking for a nice quite place to chat and this place seemed like a good fit... The atmosphere was really casual; it was really calm and inviting, definitely had a trendy coffee shop feel to it. That night it was filled with a lot of young girls in yoga pants and gym shorts... I figured it must be the post-workout spot for the ladies from the LVAC across the lot.  Anyhow... as we came in my friend had ordered a wheat grass drink and we took to a table along the back wall. The seating area was nice, all of the tables were cleared and they had a grape green hue to match the healthy theme of the entire place. What was also nice was the waterfall that ran across the entirety of the back wall. Definitely gave it a calming feel with a modern nature theme... if you can try to picture that.  As we were seated I couldn't help but notice the quality of service the server/cashier was providing. While taking every order he would try to acknowledge the guest by their first name. It definitely gave it a personalized feel. It was nice to see, and I could notice a lot of the guests were regulars... if only they did a better job at greeting us as we entered the place.   While we were seated I also ended up ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap. The price was a little unreasonable for what I got, I understand it's a healthy choice but for $10.99 I expect to get a little more for the buck. I guess all that extra money went into the plating and presentation, which brings me to the next point. For as good as it looked the flavor was very disappointing. The wrap had no taste at all; the only thing that helped me distinguish the ingredients was their texture.   Overall for what we came for I would say it definitely met our expectations and didn't disappoint, however the food wasn't so great. The ambiance was 5/5, Service was 4/5, and the Food Quality was 3/5; presentation was great, ingredients seemed fresh and health, but the taste was not there at all. Maybe it was just what I had ordered.  I will most likely not eat here again but if I needed a nice casual meeting spot I would definitely keep this place in mind. Although my experience with the food was not pleasant the intent of the visit was for a casual meeting spot and it definitely delivered on that.",

The good- The juices are pretty good. Never been disappointed here. They have a sort of build your own meal. You pick a protein, grain, veggie and a sauce. That was probably my favorite meal here. I also have tried the Gluten free pizza and it was pretty tasty.  The bad- I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun. The gluten free bun was stale and hard.  I was really disappointed. I know people seem to love the tofu fried but I did not like them. They were just rubbery and tasteless.  The service for me has always been pretty good. Once, they messed up me and my husband's order and they were quick to make it right, giving us an extra order of tofu fries. Though once my husband went in to pick up our order and a kid at the front desk called him \"boss\" which really annoyed him. He found it a bit condescending.   Yes, I will go here again. I actually meet people here all the time. The dinning room is comfortable the decor is organic and inviting.",

It's not uncommon for me to find moldy berries in my \"summer berry salad\" or hair in my food from and an employee with hands in their hair. I've seen employee's prepping food and taking calls on the phone, using the register with gloves on, answering the to go phone with gloves on then keeping those gloves on to prep food. The menu is good, and the food can be good if there's no hair or moldy berries,  but the people who work there need to be re-trained with health code standards. Also, I notice they get  to go orders wrong (which is obviously annoying) and charge a few bucks higher for the same order than the west location, and when I inquire as to why, sometimes they correct the value and sometimes they don't. I think it's embarrassing to argue about a buck or two with and employee who is just a kid and looks at you like are you seriously arguing about a buck or two.... But, yeah, why is there a price difference? I don't want to be charged more from the same order when I eat at both locations a few times a week. Sometimes they charge you for cheese sometimes they don't stuff like that. I think the place has great potential but staff has room for improvement and need training both in procedure and health standards. This review is based on my experiences at the Eastern location.",

Lettuce (romaine I think) was very tough and hard, simply wrapped around a bunch of tofu (looked like the tofu fries before being breaded and cooked).  Not wrapped at all so all the filling fell out as soon as I picked it up.  The tofu was supposed to be marianated, but it certainly wasn't.   When I marinate tofu in teriyaki sauce, it absorbs the marinade and turns brown.  G&P's tofu was still white and flavorless.  Supposed to include cukes and something else.  Nothing but a lettuce leaf, flavorless tofu and sauce (which dripped all over the plate).   When I went back to the counter to talk to the manager, I was told they weren't in!  This place blew it.

I brought a friend with me so I could get a second opinion. I made the mistake of ordering the same chicken wrap, thinking it would be better the second time around. Nope. My friend had the Bison wrap and loved it. I hesitated to update my review because I still wasn't impressed by the food, but didn't want to post a negative review when I knowingly ordered something I didn't like the first time around and my friend loved his wrap. But seriously, if you're healthy food joint and can't make a good grilled chicken wrap... what can I say?  I tried it again one more time and had the turkey burger, which while it needed some salt - was much better than the chicken wrap. The tomatoes were a way overripe ... but it wasn't bad as a whole. I still love the idea of the jicama fries, but they could really do something to make them tastier, like a citrus dressing option or something.. anything. LOL. All in all, I might eat here on occasion - but for what it is I think it's way overpriced. I spent $17+ today for the burger and a juice drink. Definitely not affordable or good enough for a daily lunch option. The place is busy, busy though... so it doesn't look like they're hurting for business.",

I don't mind spending money on food specially if it's good quality but it wasn't. I ordered a Greek pizza w out cheese on a vegan crust and it was so dry! The hummus looked old and I was burping it up two hours later. My boyfriend ordered a chicken wrap (which was not bad according to him) however he felt extremely bloated afterwards. Lastly I had an acai bowl and I was so extremely disappointed, the granola was chewy and old tasting, the fruits were alright but the acai was off in color. It wasn't a rich purple it was more of a raspberry pink. Seriously do not recommend. A myriad of people love it but I just want to share my experience.",

    "text": "I like the novelty of Greens and Proteins, but find the execution a bit \"off\".   It's nice to offer a version of fast food gone healthy, but I found many of the options very bland.  The jicama \"fries\" are a nice choice, but I'll go for the seasoned tofu fingers over the cool jicama any day.  The addition of the crunchy/healthy side is nice, though.  I had bites of the bison burger ordered by others at the table, which was fine - a typical bison burger, but my veggie patty was not what I expected.  I thought since the place focuses on healthy that the veggie patty would be - veggie.  But nope, it's 100% soy and pretty bland.  I was pretty dissappointed.  Some of the drinks/smoothies are fun, but it's not enough to draw me in without a meal I'm excited about.  I'll try more things, maybe some wraps will rock my world, but the bland and soy-ness of the veggie patty was enough to discourage me for a while.",
