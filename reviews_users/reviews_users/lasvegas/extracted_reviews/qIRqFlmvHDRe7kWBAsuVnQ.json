Usually I'd have to drive to Island Style for some jjangmyon but I wanted to try this place out since it's close to my house. Walked in and first noticed the unique decor which I like.  Ordered the dumplings and they were super tasty. Crispy and fluffy. I also ordered the Jjangban Jjajang. Super tasty as well with lots of seafood.  Overall I was very happy with my experience. Definitely another place on my list of spots to eat around town now!",

The menu overall covers a lot of bases (even American Chinese) without being overwhelming. I was looking forward to coming here since I've had a hankering for jajangmyeon and if that's \"Korean Chinese Cuisine\" in your name, there's gotta be jajangmyeon, my dude. I found that the black bean sauce has the subtle sweetness that I look for, so I'm glad I've finally found my jajangmyeon spot. I also liked the japchae, honey walnut shrimp, and Buddha's Delight, which were were all nicely portioned for sharing.  The design of the restaurant interior is reminiscent of a movie set, sort of garish but still pretty cute, with both open floor and sectioned off tables for seating. Service is warm and welcoming with a few hiccups, though this is likely because the restaurant as a whole is still finding its footing. I'll likely be back!",

    "text": "Was really excited to try the black bean noodles they have, saw it in plenty of Korean dramas but have never had it so really wanted to try. The place is very nicely decorated, clean, and is spacious, lots of tables. We came in around 12:30, were immediately seated...everything went downhill from there. We sat there for about 15 minutes, no one else greeted us or even brought us water. Then the waitress came by and took our order...then they brought out kimchi and pickled veggies and we still didn't get water.   My brother got seafood fried rice which he thought was ok, I thought it was too wet, only a few  baby shrimps and two pieces of muscles and its considered \"seafood\" fried rice. My sister got the rice with pork and vegetables which was pretty good. We ordered dumplings as appetizers which came out after the fried rice and the rice bowl. I got the black bean noodles with pork which never came out! I waited and waited, then asked for it and the guy told me they \"forgot to make it.\" So I cancelled it. I will say that the fried rice and the rice bowl came out super quick...the food that we did get didn't take long to come out at all.   I don't think they have bad service in the sense that the staff were lazy or incompetent, I think they are extremely understaffed. They only had three people working and had a pretty decent number of tables, so I can see that they are working hard. I hate to give them only two stars but for a place that is new they should have more staff and give the best service so people will spread the word.   For this particular experience I was extremely disappointed. We were not given good service, waited quite a while for our order to be taken, waited a long while for water and water was not re-filled, they forgot my order, and the rest of the food was not impressive.   I might go back in a few months when they have been open for a while and operation should be more smooth because I really want to try the black bean noodles, but nothing else draws me back to this place.",

The inside was well decorated and clean.  I should also mention that from the outside it was hard to tell the restaurant was open.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful.    We got our food and it tasted great.  My personal selection was quite limited since I don't like seafood (it is in many of their entrees).  Still the seafood-free noodle dish I ordered was delicious as was my husbands fried chicken dish.   This restaurant is a. Chinese/Korean place so the style and spice level of the food would probably be more familiar to people unfamiliar with Korean cuisine.  This would make it ideal for bringing my less adventurous friends to introduce them to Korean fare for the first or second time.   I would come back to this restaurant and would gladly recommend it to my friends.",

We have been going there at least once a week for a couple of months now for family lunch/ dinners. We went there for a late lunch and we were very disappointed. The jajangmyeon was very watered down almost like a soup .. WT? The taste was nothing like it was when we first started coming here. The food took a long time to come out and it was not even that busy. The jjampong had so much onions in it. The waitress was very nice and apologized for the wait which is not her fault. I really don't know what happened to this place that had such great food. Will most likely not come back or tell family and friends about this place. Very disappointing",

This place is pretty cute inside. Some might say overdecorated and cliche but it's unique to vegas at least. The decor is stereotypical Beijing chic.   For the two of us we ordered jampong (seafood soup) with no noodles, jajangmein (black bean noodle) and tonsiu yuk ( fried pork). The jampong is super spicy. If you're not into spicy foods I would avoid this because it definitely has a kick. It doesn't have as much seafood as other places but the broth is stronger and more flavorful.   The black bean noodle was good. It's not too salty and the flavor is mild. The tong Siu yuk was really good. The quality of the meat was much better than anywhere I've had it. It's lean pork meat with not too much batter and the sauce added sweet and vinegary notes to the dish.",

I can say it is one of the best jjajangmyun i have ever eaten in US.  For the tang su yuk, of course it is not crispy anymore. The sauce however, is just so so. I had tasted better ones before.  If you are not big fan of tang su yuk, just order their jjajangmyun. Really.",

Inside the decor is really impressive with a larger industrial space containg Chinese decor and sectioned off rooms. Each room reminds me of the ancient Chinese bedrooms with tables for groups of up to 6.   Service was pretty good. No complaints. Attentive and very quick service.   THe food was incredibly mediocre. The bonchons were a fraction of what I have received at a real Korean place, however, even the ones we got were sad. A lot of pickled onions...that tastes as good as it sounds.  The Gan Jjajang was sad sad in the sauce was mostly onions and very little any other vegetables. Essentially, the noodles were tasteless and even when mixed it was the sauce it was so mediocre.  The Jjampong was pretty good. THere was a good variety of seafood and overall very light and tasted reasonable.   Fried rice no complaints but nothing spectacular.  I did not enjoy the fried dumplings. Usually dumplings are seared to give it a slight crunch, but the complete frying of them did not taste good and again below average.",

The jjampong broth was delicious!!  The bowl was humungous as well.  The samseon gan jjajang was equally delicous.  So much seafood piled into my bowl.  The food was very good, definitely as good as what you'll find in k-town LA!!  I dined with my mom, and she loved both dishes as well.  When a Korean mom says it's good, you know it's good.  Can't argue with mom!!  The service was really good.  The waitress greeted us as we came in and was very courteous.  Without us asking, she brought 2 extra small bowls because she knew we were going to share.  Also, it seems like the staff is bilingual in Korean and English.  I'm unsure if anyone spoke any Chinese dialect.    I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I hate the tables and chairs.  I found the chairs to be too high in relation to the height of the table.  Around the bottom of the tables is a decorative piece that I kept bumping my legs into.  I found this to be very annoying.    Overall, I loved the food and found the prices to be very cheap.  Most likely I'll get a to-go order on my next visit so I don't have to deal with the tables and chairs.  But other than that, a very welcome addition to the Southwest area of town.  I am very very very glad to have such a good new restaurant in my neighborhood!!",

Black bean noodle could have a little more cuts of pork, it was more bits than bites. Service: This happened last time, and it happened again; the waitress forgot our order after confirming it multiple times with us. The order never got processed and we waited ~30mins until we asked another waiter if it got processed, and he finally got it in the system.  Please consider re-training your workers. Sure this time was a bit busy due to holidays, but last time it happened there were only one other party of two, when we were only three people. Don't make the chefs look bad because the waiters can't process an order.",

And that was the last time we were helped by anyone. Soon after a rowdy party of 8 came In followed by a party of 4 and a party of 2. All of them got service and placed their orders before anyone even came back to us. We contemplated leaving but figured we'd give them another minute. A minute goes by and still nothing so we get up and leave to head to Goong next door. On our way out we pass the server who doesn't say a word to us. At least we know we'll get a good meal for sure at Goong.  UPDATE TO REVIEW. The owner contacted me after reviewing their video and apologized. Classy move.

Specialize in Korean/Chinese style of cooking including jyajyang myun, chanpon sea spicy noodle, Chinese dishes like beef broccoli and walnut shrimp, and mandoo/potsticker dumpling  2. Couple drinks like sake and beer  Service 1. I loved my service here, the server invited me to sit down and offered me a drink!   2. The preparation of my To go order was so quick!    Ambiance 1. I think it is quite beautiful compared to other jyajyang myun style restaurants, modern lamps and a Chinese flair!  I'd definitely go back because it was welcoming and comfortable   MoJo 1. I took the food to go/takeout and it was still good when I got home.  Not piping hot but you just have to mix the sauce with the noodle!  It is more like an udon noodle than what I've had as a child, thinner skinny noodle kind of like ramen.  I got the yaki mandoo and the flavor was good.  Smaller than when I was a kid but still yum!  It comes with pickled radish, kimchi, and raw onion.  This is a very unique style of Korean Chinese cuisine so it may not be everyone's taste but growing up eating it - it really hit the spot!  I definitely plan to go back and hope and pray that it'll stay put !",

Their yang jang pi does lack in some seafood and veggies, but it was still tasty. The jja jang myun is served in a perfect portion and it is not too strong in taste or msg flavor that makes me drink a lot of water afterwards. I hope the service gets a little more prompt, but the servers were still very nice and attentive, so I think it is something that will get better as they settle down. I am just so glad that there is a korean chinese fusion restaurant open in SW area!",

How the food was presented was exceptional, waiters and waitresses more often check up on you and refill your drinks. I just question the fact that this place has such a low review. There was no problem when I ate here for the first time.  I recommend trying this place out, since this is one of the only Chinese restaurants in the south side of Vegas. The food is of quality, within reasonable pricing and portions. I had one appetizer, four entrees coming about 35.50.   I recommend checking this place out. Since the location, interior design, and food quality is well worth to check out.",

(taste was good)   People enjoy gourmet food  with both eye and mouth so we are trying to go better restaurant   expecting they serve looking good food without sacrificing taste.  Furthermore, the quantity was not enough for $17.  I don't know who is a manager but somebody who looked a manager was busy to talk to his   friends .  If I were a manager, I will greet all customers and try to listen their opinion.  The role of a manager cannot be overemphasized.   I think this place was just opened so it would be better as time goes on because the owner has showed very impressive success in other restaurants .    I will visit again and leave new review.",

The service was very attentive and it's a good value (huge portion sizes!) but the food itself didn't do it for me.  Jjajangmyeon is their specialty (black bean noodle with pork) and the sauce was bland and one note, I've have had better elsewhere. They brought scissors to cut the noodles, but that was unnecessary as they kept breaking off and were short. No cool noodle lift photos for us.  The Samseong Jjamppong (spicy seafood and vegetables) was a bit better, but the table was in agreement that the spicy sauce just tasted spicy without a developed flavor. Same issue with the noodles, broke easily and just weren't very chewy. Prefered this soup for the seafood.  Maybe they have consistency issues, or maybe I'm just not a fan of their food. Would come back if a friend suggested it, but would try other dishes. These didn't live up to the hype.",

    "text": "My dad was in the mood for Korean Chinese food, and my trusty yelp app pulled through   What I ate - Jjampong: OMG, that broth, so clean, so good, so perfect. It was rich, without being too oily or greasy. You could definitely taste the wok fire flavor in the seafood. Perfect hangover food - Jja jjang myun: I rarely eat jja jjang myun unless I'm in korea. This was close to korea as I can remember. It was really well made. I was tempted to ask for a bowl of rice so I could finish the rest of the sauce that was leftover. The noodles had a nice bite to them  - Dumplings: These were just a-ok, nothing special. The filling was tasty, but the dumpling skin was a bit too thick - Egg drop soup: Being slightly hungover, I just wanted something warm and simple to drink, and this fit the bill. But, nothing overly amazing to write home about  Pros: - That menu was really beautiful and easy to read for both Korean and Americans. Plenty of beautiful pictures. I also liked that they had a nice variety of options to order from. They had multiple types of jjam pong and jja jjang myun - Staff was super friendly and checked in on us regularly - Decor was really cute - Plenty of seats/tables for small and large parties - Bathroom was really clean - Parking was not too bad on a weekday for dinner  Cons: - They didn't have the traditional chinese soup spoons, just metal spoons. I'm so used to using those chinese soup spoons, that it felt kind of wrong using a metal spoon to eat the soup - While the decor was cute and super Chinese/Asian, those wooden chairs were SOOOOOO uncomfortable to sit in. Super straight back, no cushion. It was kind of torture! - I wish they offered a bowl/cup of the jjampong soup. The server was nice enough to offer me one, but I opted for something milder and ordered the egg drop soup instead. I think a small cup of the soup would be a great way to end the meal if you had rice and other dishes - Sadly, they were very empty. The food and service was so great. I hope they are more on the busy side on the weekends. I was a bit nervous when I first walked in because they were completely empty, but I tried to rationalize it by saying it was a Monday night, kind of on the early side for dinner - This is such a strange gripe, but I kind of hated the black/dark mirror in the female bathroom. It was really cool to look at, but really difficult to see if I had any red pepper flakes stuck in my teeth after I ate LOL  Would I come again? Yes, next time I'm in town with my parents!",

    "text": "First off, this place offers a free eggroll, ice cream or soda for a yelp review..so i wasn't sure how accurate the reviews we're for this place when reading the reviews prior to coming. But decided to give it a try...  Being korean, I was craving for some good korean chinese food. Found this place and thought I'd give it a try. Korean chinese foods most popular dishes are jjajangmyun, jjampong, and tangsuyuk.  I ordered their lunch special which had all 3 of the dishes I listed above. And it only costs $23.95..which ia a pretty good deal for all the food you get...but the food was a major disappointment.   First tangsuyuk came out. It was crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside. However, i don't think they seasoned the meat prior to cooking. The tangsuyuk sauce was given on the side (which is to help the meat be crispier). Sauce was not good. It was a bit watery than the usually ones I've had else where and it had a strange taste to it. Also a bit bland. Usually the sauce should be a little thick than watery.   Second the jjajangmyun. Consists of noodles with a black bean sauce poured on top. You mix it all together and eat. Sauce was wayy too overly sweet for me and also watery. Sauce should also be somewhat thick but it wasn't.   Third item is the jjampong. It's a spicy seafood noodles. This had a kick of spiciness which i loved. Noodles were cooked well, but the soup could have used a bit more flavor.   Overall i was not blown away. Everything was just too bland for me. I probably won't ever return.",

    "text": "I stopped here for noodles served in a different way.  The restaurant was almost empty on this early Sunday evening and I was led to an area where I could sit where I wanted.  I was brought iced tea quickly and the server took my order, Jjajangmyeon, a Korean dish of long length noodles with a sauce of black beans and pork.  Before the noodles came, I was brought sides of onion, kimchi, daikon, and a small dish of bean paste.  I was surprised at the mild spice of the kimchi.  Normally, there's more red pepper but this was quite tame.  I added some ground, red pepper to spice it up.  After the noodles came, the server brought me large shears to cut the noodles.  I think this was to help this caucasian eat his noodles easier, much like a mom cuts spaghetti for her youngster.  None of the Asians  in the restaurant were brought such shears.  They worked well and it was easier to eat the noodles so I appreciate her thoughtfulness.  The flavor of the bean sauce with the small pork cubes was very good and it made for a nice change.  I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.  Service was very good and it was good value.  I'd recommend getting the small size unless you intend to share.  It was a good amount of food.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place... Tried this place twice and it was a polar opposite experience between the two trips.  Both times I ordered the jjajangmyuen, the classic, nothing added.   First time it was absolutely amazing. I was shocked I haven't discovered this place sooner. It was the closest to the authentic korean kind you'd get from the homeland. The noodles were fresh, the sauce wasn't pasty, it did take some time for them to bring the food out, but well worth the wait.   The second time it was the exact opposite...maybe it was because I ordered a large rather than the small...? But that shouldn't hinder the quality. This time around, the jjajang sauce was not runny at all. It was thick AF.  The kind of thick you'd expect it to be seeing it in the fridge as leftovers a couple days after. Not pleasant at all :(  they didn't even have kimchi as a banchan either.   They say third time is the charm, but I'm pretty remorseful after that second trip.... The plaza has TONS of good choices, I'd probably visit SOYO before going here again :)",

Yusansuel is vastly different from what I'm used to from other Korean Chinese restaurants. Seems it's been tailored for Western taste buds. I didn't like it and neither did my friend. Jja jjang myun was bland. Overall not very good. Wouldn't recommend.",

    "text": "Got there last week with my girlfriend. We were seated, but happened that the seat was reserved for someone else. They apologized and asked us if we can sit elsewhere. We really did not mind, because our couple work for customers also; Everyone makes mistakes. We were been seated on the other spot, and one of our server insisted to give us complimentary fried dumpling. We really did not mind switching the seat, because it is not a single big deal, but... Well okay..? It is free so I will take it. The server was Stephen I think. While we were ordering, we asked him to see if we can get some jjambbong soup by itself as a complimentary. Stephen told us he won't be able to guarantee us that he is able to give us jjambbong soup, but he will try best, and gave us an alternatives egg soups instead, if it is in that case. Which was great, amazing. Food was great, nothing special, but we enjoyed our time. jjambbong soup came out a bit late, but we were okay. Stephen apologized for being so late, but I really did not mind, because we were not that tricky and jjambbong soup was something that was not guaranteed like what he mentioned earlier. When our check came out and paid with our credit card, I don't know why, but gratuity line has been already filled with $0. I believed that he felt apologized, so he decided not to take gratuity from us since he thought that he did not serve us well. I was embarrassed, because I have never seen as attentive server as him, and he tried his best on what he could to please us. And we decided to just pay gratuity with cash. I believe we have dropped around 20% of the gratuity.   Again, great place to eat when I am into Korean style Chinese food. It was great experience for us, and we never thought that we've been treated badly, everything was good.",

    "text": "Mom and I were desperate for Korean Jajamyung but, a lot of the places were closed. It was meant to be. Found a place that just happened to be back in our neck of the woods and it was an absolute gem of a find. Living in Vegas but, being from So. Cal, it's hard not to compare the Korean food to what we're used to in K-town L.A., quality, selection, types, the whole nine. Vegas is really starting to make a difference with its selection of Korean places to eat. L.A. has some of the best Korean/Chinese traditional foods but, thankfully, we found this place that I must've passed a gazillion times and never noticed that it was even there. The owner is from L.A. apparently, and knows how Vegas is in need of the very choices you get over there. He even went so far as to add all three styles in one shopping mall--3 separate restaurants! Korean/Chinese, Korean Steakhouse with choice meats, and the traditional Gook Bap (hot soups and more traditional Korean fare). Goong BBQ, is next to this place and Soyo is to the left, bringing K-Town in the suburbs. I love it!!! They make fresh mandoo (dumplings) from scratch here. Their family member (possibly grandmother) sits on one side of the restaurant and makes the dumplings each day. What's so awesome about this place is that their \"Happy Hour\" is almost like stealing from them. Large regular menu sized portions for the most part, especially the Jajamyung, but on their Happy Hour menu for $5!!! They have a nice selection for people who are more hungry from 9:00pm till close (Mon-Thurs 1:00am, Fri-Sun 2:00am). The quality--now that's what this is really all about. The sauce isn't packaged or from powder. It's as fresh as it can get. Not too salty as some sauces for Jajamyung can be a bit overpowering on the sodium. It's not too thick to where you have to keep remixing it nor, is it too runny. The noodles are FRESH!!! Homemade or handmade for sure! It's too perfect for it not to be. Quality here is off the charts. Price is super super reasonable. Service is extremely on point! They also, use all delivery services--Grubhub, Uber Eats and Postmates. This has to end up becoming the neighborhood jaunt. If you don't want to deal with cramped parking off of Spring Mountain Chinatown, or the sketchy area itself, check out this place and it's sister joints. It's all in once place and there is no skimp on quality.",

The girl who helped us was very nice and friendly. She took the time to explain the different menu items, because if you don't speak Korean and aren't familiar with Korean food names, you won't know what the items are.   We always get two things and share. My boyfriend ordered shrimp fried rice, and it was...shrimp fried rice. It's kind of hard to either mess it up or make it a stand-out item. It was good. I ordered the gan jjajang, which the girl described as having pork and vegetables in a black bean sauce. The sauce was tasty, but I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that 3/4 of the dish was onions. There were a few pieces of zucchini and a few pieces of pork. It really should be advertised as an onion dish. Unfortunately, my boyfriend doesn't like onions. Normally, he can pick them out and it isn't a problem, but if you pick the onions out of the dish, there is nothing left but maybe two bites of pork and zucchini.   After several days in a part of the country with terrible food, we were so excited to get back home to our many amazing food options. Unfortunately, we won't be adding this to our local repertoire.",

    "text": "I've been looking for a Korean/Chinese restaurant since the restaurant that I went to in Chinatown closed. So I was super duper excited to see what this place had opened up!!  But I was a little disappointed. :(  The service was not quite up to par... Don't get me wrong the service was what you would get in Korea... Where you had to flag down your server by yelling across the dining room... But in the US... That doesn't really fly.... You know? The server was nice and answered all the questions I had but I had to crane my neck the entire time I was there and try to make eye contact multiple times just to get the check. But to his credit.... It looked like he was the only one taking orders????? There were 2 other ladies there but they just seem to refill water and bring out food. :/ They might need to rethink this. 1 server for that dining area is not enough.  (2/5)  Ambiance... Whoa! This place is definitely bigger then I expected when I walked in. It was huge! I didn't get the see the private rooms or the dining area in the back of the room... But it is definitely bigger then expected! The entrance way was a little dark but the rest of the dining room was very bright. Most of the dining area was painted white with the left side of the dining area being a bright red. It was very clean and the space was very open. Ambiance definitely 5/5  Food... And drink....I asked for barley tea and was told that they only had Jasmine tea... It was served in a cute little pot with a tiny glass... Tea was decent but I really would've liked barley tea. The side dishes or banchan were ok. It was Kim chi made with American cabbage instead of Napa cabbage... This was actually really good and had a great texture. The other dish was raw onions and the traditional yellow pickled daikon served with the black bean sauce who happens to be one of my favs. :) But that was it. Maybe in the future they will have more??? I ordered the deep fried dumplings and that was good. The skin was crispy and the filling was meaty and juicy. And they have vinegar, soy sauce and fine ground chili flakes on the table to make your own sauce for the dumplings. I just wished they had the black vinegar as I think it tastes better then the normal white vinegar for these types of dumplings. 4/5   I also ordered the jja-jang-myun. The price was decent... It was only $6.95 for the small. This was done more the Korean way instead of the Chinese way which is what I was expecting since most of the pictures they had displayed the Chinese version. The flavor was ok. It was tad sweet for me and I didn't get the porky flavor that I was expecting as well. The noodles were also over cooked as they were very very soft and had no mouth feel. They also need to tighten up the sauce a little as after I was done picking out all the noodles, the sauce was completely soupy which it definitely should not be. 2/5  Overall, I think based off of the dishes that I ordered today that they lean more towards the Korean way of cooking things then the Chinese which was a little disappointing. But since I normally drive all the way to Island Style to get my jja-jang-myun fix...I most likely will be back as this place is only 5 minutes from the house. I'm hoping that they fix the service and fix the jja-jang-myun. Next time I come, I definitely will try something different.  ***Tip... Pour extra vinegar onto the daikon and the onions and dip it into the black bean sauce and enjoy!  :)",

This place is disappointingly average.  We ordered jajiang mein, jampong and Gan Peng Ji.  Jajiang mein..sauce average.  Noodle was in one big klump, which means it was sitting there for a while before they brought it out.  In my opinion these noodles should be al dente (as the Italians would say) or QQ ( as the taiwanese would day) or chewy and springy (as Mike K) would say.  You guessed it...these noodles are not.   Jam Pong.  I got the non spicey since my stomach has betrayed me and I can't eat spicey now.  But even with no spice this broth was excellent.  But the noodles....just like the jajiang mein..has no body or chew.  Gan Peng Ji.  I don't understand all these places that make it with a tomato paste.  It's supposed to be a soy garlic sauce. Here they make it with tomato paste.  Not only is it not good..but really over priced.  Normally korean restaurants give you a big portion of this even if it's not good..but here..small for $14.99.  On the really positive side...really good service..",

The inconsistency in the food quality is actually impressive - some nights, the jjajangmyun is deserving of a five star review, but on others, we're left questioning if the head chef had changed. Today, I wasn't sure if there was even a chef back there - I don't think I've ever tasted a jjajangmyun so bland and oily. The onions tasted old, and the tang-soo-yuek was absolutely covered with pepper, as if to cover up its actual taste.  A restaurant is only as good as we can expect it to be. I can't expect much from this restaurant.",

    "text": "We tried to come in on Sunday night. However, after waiting a good amount of time to even be greeted, they told us their kitchen was backed up. That's completely fine since it was newly opened but I don't like waiting in an area looking like a dummy and being ignored just because you had bad news to give me. I know they saw us but didn't bother to acknowledge we were there to just say hold a moment. Just ignored us until they told us they had a 40 minute wait. Anyways, came in on Monday for lunch.   We got the mapo tofu, pork fried rice, jajangmyeon, and the fried dumplings. Mopo tofu was disappointing. Mapo tofu is known for that numbing spiciness. It didn't have any sign of that. Meh.   The jajangmyeon was the best of what we ordered and it was the cheapest thing we ordered. It is a bit on the sweeter side. But it was weirdly inconsistent. My friend got the same thing and his sauce was thick while mine ended up watery. I'm not sure if its just because I eat slower or not.   Fried rice was supposed to have pork in it but somehow there was no pork? I'm not really sure what happened to that dish there.   Fried dumplings were yummy so I can't really complain about these. I don't think you can really go wrong with those anyways. However, dumplings cost more than the noodles. I don't really quite understand that.  Anyways, I would come back but only to try the other Korean dishes and give them another shot because I REALLY want to like them. But I'll wait till they get things more organized.",

After some yelp searching, I decided on YuXiang since some Jjajangmyun sounds good to me.   I was pleasantly surprise to see how clean and modern this restaurant looked.  Service was good.  We ordered: -Fried Dumplings: My toddler loved it.  She ate 4 dumplings (some filling was dropped on the ground and to me, it was not the firm consistency that I have seen at other establishments). -Jjangmyun: not as flavor as I have had at this other chinese/korean restaurant.  I was disappointed. -Fried porkchops in chili sauce: most disappointing dish of the meal.  Something was missing... -Honey Walnut Shrimp: The shrimps were big but lacking some flavor, however, the coating was nice and crisp.  The food came with a side of yellow radish, pickled cabbage, white onions, and black bean sauce.    Will we return?  Maybe not.",

    "text": "If you are a noodle lover, add YuXiang Korean Chinese Cuisine to your list!  Located at Rainbow and Robindale, the mecca of Vegas' new Little China Town, It's certainly appropriate to have a Korean-Chinese restaurant...especially when you consider that this is the best on a short list of Korean-Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I grew up in Korea, but I've been a resident of Las Vegas for almost two decades now and YuXiang has instantly become my one and only spot for Jjamppong and Jjajangmeon, for me since they opened. I first saw their pictures from THE Philip T's feed and WOW!!!  I was hooked to come in and try for myself.  The staff is young and professional...most of them speak both English and Korean.  If you are not sure about what to order, they will give you great suggestions....but the menu is well manufactured with pictures of the dishes, so it's easy to make a decision. If you like it a little spicier, chef Lim will do that for you...if you like more seafood, no pork, chef Lim will do that for you. Chef often comes out to say hello, so if you see him don't forget to say hi back.  Let's talk about Jjamppong. The broth is packed with flavor, the noodles are cooked to perfection...chewy, thick, and long....they don't break like many others. I normally get Seafood Jjamppong...tons of seafood, just the way I like.  If you need more noodle or sauce, just ask them...the friendly staff will accommodate your likings.   There is hot tea, Soju, and even Chinese liquor available if you want to cool down your tongue.   If you haven't been yet, then make it a point to come down and try this well decorated and well staffed delicious Korean-Chinese option!   - 2018 review #3-",

    "text": "Easily the best Jjajangs and Jjamppongs in town, YuXiang offers these and other classic Korean Chinese dishes in a lovely setting! If you already like Jjajangs and Jjamppongs, then suffice it to say, you NEED to make your way to YuXiang, if you haven't already, for the best Korean Chinese food in town.  I first had Jajangmyen at an elevated Korean fusion restaurant several years ago and have loved it ever since.  Prior to this experience, I didn't know that Korean Chinese Cuisine was even a thing, but in the same way that we have bastardized Chinese food in America (or should I say it has been bastardized here) based on available ingredients, and the pallets of the nationals, the same divergence happened long ago in Korea. There are only a few places in town that specialize in Korean Chinese Cuisine, and YuXiang is not only the tastiest, but also provides the best atmosphere by a long way.  If you haven't had the opportunity to taste Korean Chinese dishes there are a couple of gateway dishes that are highly reminiscent of American Chinese options: Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork or beef) and Kkanpunggi (spicy garlic fried chicken)...we shared both of these as appetizers on separate occasions with friends or family we came with.   The real standouts for me are the previously mentioned classics though: Jjajang and Jjamppong. I usually get the Samseon Gan Jjajang without the pork, because I love seafood, but try to limit my pork intake. The dish is $11 and it hits the spot! I love the thick rich taste of the black bean sauce. Highly recommended. My love likes it spicy and orders one of the Jjampongs, typically the extra spicy Bull Jjamppong or the seafood Samseon Jjamppong. The extra spicy is just that...extra spicy, while the Samseon Jjamppong is a great way to enjoy some seafood in a more approachable spicy broth. While a little more adventurous, Jjamppong is certainly worth trying for all but those with the narrowest pallets.  There are even some American Chinese dishes available if you aren't down with broadening your horizons, but these are not the dishes I make the drive across town to enjoy.  In the end, YuXiang is the absolute best in town...so I could be inclined to pass out 5 stars, but i don't want to get your expectations any higher than they need to be. If you aren't looking specifically for Korean Chinese food, then YuXiang is a very solid 4 stars...and if you are specifically looking for Korean Chinese food, then YuXiang is the beginning and end of the story in Vegas.",

    "text": "My friend craved for nice Jjampong and so did I, got this Korean Chinese restaurant from yelp and visited here for today's lunch on Thursday. As Korean, this cuisine is one of the cuisine we used to have during our childhood back home. My Korean friend took me and 3 years old child over there and we were the first customer at 11:30am. The interior was beautiful in red panels and wooden in Asian decor. Quite exotic furnishing mix with modernism.  We ordered the lunch menu; jjajangmyeon with Tangsuyuk + and Jjampong with Kkanpunggi +.  A nice Korean lady served us with drinks, side dishes and main dishes in such a nice manners. I requested to have kid's noodles only on baby plate as my child prefers no sauce on noodles, the server kindly brought it with her booster seat.  The rest room is clean on surface and well stocked in liquid soap and toilet rolls and baby changer on wall at ladies room.   I expected certain quality on this visit and we both love each dish. It was good to choose Jjajangmyeon and Jjampong as well as Ttangsuyuk and Kkanpungi. We shared most of dishes in additional bowls we got and couldn't stop finishing their Jjampong soup until it shows the bottom.   It was a good portion for lunch for noodle dishes and Jjampong soup was excellent with generous noodles and seafood.   Soon after our main dishes out, more tables have been filled with guests. Frequently the servers asked us is there any thing we need to refil as side dishes, we didn't need more as their initial serving portion's generous for 2 adults.  It was quite a drive from where we live but I certainly can say this place is the best in Las Vegas after my visits to different Korean Chinese restaurants. Definitely more upscale and tasty in every dish.",

My parents are Chinese born in Korea and my dad makes the best jjajang but I have to say, even him and my mom enjoyed this place.   We got a few dishes - such as the mixed vegetables, meat, seafood, on top of noodles and mustard sauce ($27 - can't remember the name) but very delicious. My mom felt like her craving for it was satisfied. We also enjoyed the 6 seafood combo with rice ($15) and the seafood gan jjajang ($11). I thought the gan jjajang was just short of how salty I like it though but it still satisfied my cravings!   The place was well decorated and not too big or small. It was clean - the servers were sweet and the food came out at a very adequate and appropriate speed.   Next time, I will get the champong and definitely tangsuyuk (sweet & sour pork)! I really enjoyed the gan jjajang and had some left over that I will be enjoying over rice. I also bet their traditional jjajangmyun is delicious (prob a better option for take out or delivery since gan jjajang is meant to be enjoyed fresh in the restaurant). There are also many different Korean Chinese dishes that I bet are tasty.   Check this gem on the SW out! It's in the same parking lot as Goong KBBQ, Dairy Queen, etc.",

What really impressed me was the owner pulling me aside and again apolozing  for what happened. It takes a lot to own up to a mistake and although I personally wouldn't use doordash anymore I think this situation won't happen to other customers since the owner is trying to fix the issue with his delivery services.

This establishment's service is fair, their environment is relatively clean, and the pricing is average. The only dishes experienced here was the   gan jjajang and tangsuyuk. I have eaten the same 2 dishes at this establishment a total of 3 times before writing this review.   In my opinion, on all 3 visits, the gan jjajang tasted salty and the tangsuyuk (fried pork) was not crispy. It is important I note that though the tangsuyuk is served with sauce, I order it with the sauce on the side. To be clear, my rating of 2 is based on my personal experience of the same dishes eaten 3 times at this establishment.   I was not able to honestly state that the service was better than \"fair\", because on my first visit the time between ordering and receiving the order was approximately 40 minutes. The waiting staff stated that there was a shortage of cooks. I do not hold this against the waiting staff, but it does impact the overall \"service\" aspect. The longer wait time did not occur on the following 2 visits, however the first visit must be accounted for in the overall review.  It is not my desire to defame a small business, but I cannot sincerely recommend this establishment to others.",

Our favorite dishes to order are:  1. Jajang myun 2. Jampong soup 3. Honey walnut shrimp  I loved jajang myun as a kid so I was happy to find a place that serves it (5 minutes away from my boyfriend's house). The jampong soup is deliciously hot and spicy, and the honey walnut shrimp are huge and taste so good! There are a few other things that are good on happy hour too, but these are our favorites. Service is fast and very friendly, polite, and professional. Short and sweet. Food is ready fast and our order is never messed up. They always make sure our drinks are always filled and they check up on us often!",

    "text": "I had no idea that Korean/Chinese cuisine even existed prior to YuXiang opening last year.  From my initial taste to several visits since then, I find the menu to be a whole different kind of comfort food that's chock-full of warmth, spice and carbs.  If you enjoy both Korean and Chinese, I am pretty certain you'd dig this and if you don't like either, please unfriend me immediately.  When it comes to starters, fried is my friend and I rotate between a few.  The \"Crispy Spicy Wings\" have a nice crunch and are the type of wings I eat until there's nothing but bone.  I am also not opposed to ordering the entrees as appetizers, which should definitely be considered.  The pork \"Tangsuyuk\", the K-version of sweet and sour, always seem to have a magnetic attraction to my chopsticks.  I also enjoy \"Kkanpung Saewoo\", spicy, sweet and sour shrimp, which goes great mixed with some white rice (said every Asian ever).  But the real attraction is the noodles, which are longer than some marriages.  I ain't gonna hate going basic with the \"Jjajangmyeon\", but I prefer the \"Samseon Gan Jjajang\", served in separate bowls to be combined soon after its arrival (the noodles will stick together if you wait too long...ah hem...Instagram, cough cough), the addition of seafood and freshly stir-fried sauce to the pork and vegetables make for a much more satisfying meal.  I am also very down with the \"Jjamppong\", which has solid spice and a ton of squid.   The dining area is surprisingly nice and the K-pop jams sound even better after a bottle or two of soju.   Yu bet I'll be back again.",

We were originally going to another restaurant in the same plaza but changed our minds and tried this restaurant. It's a good thing we did.   I will mainly discuss the food for my review. I wish I took pictures of the menu but it's organized well. We decided to order seafood Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong. I'll start with jjajangmyeon, a noodle dish covered in black bean sauce. The noodles were just right and the black bean sauce wasn't salty or had a black bean after taste. I don't eat jjajangmyeon a lot due to the sauce but this one I can eat for a good bit if I have the craving. The dish came with pork and seafood and it's good. Now for the other dish that I ate personally, jjamppong. It's a spicy seafood noodle dish. I love spicy food so I know I'll enjoy this. The noodles aren't too chewy and I'm surprised that they didn't get too soft while in the soup base for a long time. The broth/soup is nice and has just enough spice to feel it. They do have a spicier version for anyone that wants something spicier.   My fiance and I enjoyed the food a lot that we'll definitely be going there more often.",

So I can't believe I waited this long to try this place as it is so close to my house! Wish I got our servers name because she was pleasant and attentive the entire time.   Was in time for happy hour which is daily from 9PM-1AM (closing time). Nice selection for happy hour and prices are not bad. $5 for appetizers and $8 for entrees. And definitely come hungry because the portions of everything were generous!  My favorites: -Fried Dumplings - good starter food, very crunchy -Gan Jjajang - the black bean sauce was salty but when mixed into the noodles it was just right. So much flavor! -Stir Fried Mushroom - Again so much flavor in these sauces. Rice is a separate charge but definitely order a bowl if you order this because it is a very wet dish. -Buchu Jap Chae - comes with 3 buns to eat the pork and veggies with, ugh I'm craving it as I type!  My friends ordered a lot more items but sadly the food coma hit me so early I could not go on lol. But everything I was able to try was seriously delicious. Probably one of the best Asian places I've had in Vegas, and there really isn't that many that stand out for me but I was impressed with this one.  And I'm super freaking happy they are open late because while my sleep schedule is all F'd from working night shift, it's always a struggle to find good late night food that's close by. Great experience overall.",

YuXiang responded in the affirmative.  On entering, I was struck by the attractive dining room though it was less than half full that evening.  We started off with a pair of chicken eggrolls that were very light and flavorful. We also were served a couple of banchan's that were not particularly noteworthy.  My wife ordered Jjangmyeon noodles (noodles topped with a thick sauce made of Korean black bean paste ((Chunjang)), diced pork and vegetables).  It proved to bountiful and initially tasted wonderful, but it became a bit of a one note and probably should have been shared by 2-3 people.  I chose Samseon Jjampaong, a spicy seafood noodle soup that included black mussels, whole shrimp and overcooked calamari in a broth that included garlic and Korean red pepper.  It was just okay, but not one I would order again.",

The typical Jajangmyeon (which is what I wanted) is flavored with pork which I was told they were unable to take out as it's precooked. Instead the server recommended the stir fry version as it didn't have meat.....sorry I can't think of the name. It comes separated in two portions one noodle and once sauce. The sauce was all onions like seriously all onions with a few tiny pieces of zucchini sprinkled in. The onion flavor was so overpowering and I was disappointed I wasn't able to get what I originally wanted or what they advertised. I ate around all the onions and just had noodles with the black beans sauce on it. The flavor of the noodles was just okay. The friend I went with had the jajangmyeon which he said was pretty good. It's alittle more watered down then other places I've had.  There was a lot of liquid left in the bowl after the middles were gone. I love jajangmyeon and have missed it from my meat eating days so I was disappointed. The restaurant is very cute though and staff were nice. I'd say go if you've never have Chinese noodles before and don't want to make the drive to china town",

It pretty much exceeded our expectations and left quite satisfied. I will be coming back next time. One suggestion might be on their jjajangmyeon that we came in for, it might be better if theres a little sweetness to it",

The servers was excellent and greeted us right when we came up and everything went smoothly so i must say the customer service was great!  I ordered the Jjajang Myeon, Samseon Gan Jjajang, Tangsuyuk, and some deep fried dumplings. The deep fried dumplings was delicious! Finished it in under 2 minutes and we wanted more! The texture and cruchiness of the dumplings was perfect. I have to say the Jjajang Myeon is my favorite. It reminds me of cha cha mein but the korean version so it has a little korean twist to it, but still good! Tangsuyuk is really good too!  Has a great sauce to the deep fried pork!  Kinda like sweet and sour pork, but korean style! Overall all of the dishes was excellent and delicious and i would definitely order that Jjajang Myeon again!  I don't usually write reviews but I had to write one for this place! If you ever want to try out a korean chinese fusion restaurant, this is the spot! 5 stars",

Ever since I moved to the southwest I have been craving for some authentic Korean food. When my Korean friend suggested this place, I decided to give a try. Boy oh boy!  He makes poor choice in women, but he never gets it wrong when it comes to food. I could honestly say it was the best Korean food I ever had.   The ambience was neat and the waitress was very friendly and helped me with all my questions. I had Jajangmyeon. For the uninitiated, it's the soul food of Korea. I'd most likely come here again and order the fried dumpling next time.",

When I went there for the first time, I thought it was okay so decided to give it some time and come back. I went back 2 days ago for the second visit and everything from food to service significantly improved.   I love Gan Jjajang rather than regular Jjajangmyen so I ordered and it was great. People who like Jjajangmyen, should order Gan Jjajang I believe. Jjamppong was great and there were so much seafood in the soup. I always get Tangsuyuk with sauces on the side because I want to taste the meet itself and I like to dip it in soy sauce+vinegar+chilli powder sauce. Tangsuyuk here had a taste I had when I was in Koreatown LA.   I appreciate that we are getting more great Asian restaurants in Southwest and I will come back.",

I would go back for sure, and probably bring people I owe meals, and my bottomless pit sons.   Just two suggestions; Order the Korean entrees. They are good, and I would think better than the Chinese entrees.  And, get a booth, not a table, unless everyone in your party has short legs. For some reason, the tables do not make it comfortable for taller (I'm about 6 feet tall) persons.  Also, park over by the Dairy Queen, in the parking lot.   If they can make their tables more comfortable, and get some more parking, I might consider it for a 5 star rating.",

    "text": "Wow! This place thoroughly exceeded all my expectations!  The place is so well designed. It's such a beautiful place to spend your evening! I especially love the woodwork throughout the restaurant - everything from the decor to the tables. It's very grand and you can tell the owner paid attention to detail.   The food is absolutely delicious. I had a noodle dish with black bean sauce (Jjajangmyeon) which was absolutely delicious. My partner got the shrimp (Kkanpung saeu - see photo). Both were amazing. We also decided to try the fried dumplings and found them to be the best I've ever had! So delicious!  Lastly, the service was top notch. We never found ourselves in want and never were interrupted either. The server was so excited to share her knowledge of the food. She helped both of us pick out the best dishes to try while being very attentive to our likes and dislikes. She certainly made the experience a good one!  We will definitely be back in the future and highly recommend you stop in to try some delicious Korean Chinese cuisine in an authentic and enjoyable environment!",

    "text": "Yuxiang Korean Chinese is one of the best, if not the best Korean Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas!  My gf and I came in on black friday night after driving back from California. They had a few customers when we walked in and a few minutes later the restaurant was getting packed with families and dates.  They have a happy hour menu from which we ordered 2 items off of.   Jjajangmyeon () for 5$ was a steal! I would rate it 3 out 5 though as the sauce was more sweet than salty.   Kkanpung Gi () for 8$ was the best dish I had here tonight for a 5 out 5. The chicken was seasoned and fried so well I wanted to order another one right away because it was gone in an instant!  Samseon Jjamppong () was 12$ and man... this dish's flavors reminds me of Incheon back in South Korea. Spicy and full of seafood flavor, however the big prawn wasn't as tasty as the regular shrimps..   Would definitely recommend this place to others who want to try authentic Korea Chinese  cuisine!!",

    "text": "My friend and I came here for dinner last night during \"Happy Hour\" which starts at 9pm. It being a sunday night, the parking lot was awkwardly empty (didn't realize until i parked. My friend, as we walked towards the restaurant, made fun of my parking location as she pointed out the numerous open spots along the way, as well as in front of the restaurant).   The restaurant was fairly empty when we showed up a few minutes prior to 9pm. Max maybe 3 parties spread around the restaurant. This is the first time i've been to YuXiang. The decor is \"old styled\" where there are a lot of wooden decor and separating walls.   We were sat in our own little \"room\". The one thing i dont like about the \"decor\" is this type of table and seating is ridiculously uncomfortable because of the extra \"trim\" digging into my legs. And because they are so \"narrow\", you can barely sit 2 people next to each other of taller stature.   ANYWAYS.... about the food.   Happy hour includes 9 things priced at $5 ranging from dumplings to tostada/egg rolls to even the jjajangmyeon ! The $8 list has 18 different items including Tang Su Yuk (sweet n sour pork), kkanpung style fish/shrimp, etc.   We opt'ed to get a bul jampong to share as well as a kkanpung shrimp  Kkanpung Shrimp - Fried shrimp w/ YuXiang garlic n chili sauce  Pretty decent sized de-veined shrimp deep fried in a sort of thick-ish batter, tossed in a sweet n sour, and also spicy sauce. The normal menu one says \"prawns\" vs shrimp but unsure if there really is a different. Pretty good though. There was probably a good 10 good sized shrimps.   Bul Jjamppong - extra spicy w/ seafood, shredded pork, and vegetables  Jjamppong is a spicy noodle soup, usually with seafood and veggies. This \"bul jjamppong\" is an EXTRA spicy version. I'm not sure if jjamppong typically has shredded pork but this one does. One thing you notice is its not just boiled meats and veggies. It has a \"burned\" kind of flavor, not really but its like they cooked the seafood, meats, and veggies in a wok, then make the soup for it. There's a decent amount of noodles that was nice and chewy still.   The side dishes they gave was pickled veggies (mainly cabbage.. some carrot and cucumber), pickled daikon, and onion, with a side of the black bean sauce.   Overall, pretty yummy. Would be a super cheap deal with $5 jajangmyeon for happy hour. Unsure on the size though.",

There is a young Korean guy on the night shift that is just so sweet to us. The chairs are cute to look at but not comfortable.

We ordered a small jjajangmyeon, mapa tofu bap, and fried dumplings.   The jjajangmyeon  was very good. The sauce was not too heavy and the seasoning was perfect.  Mapa tofu with rice was good but needed to be a little more spicy for us.   The housemade fried dumplings were delicious. They tasted like the True Korean style Chinese dumplings.   The side dishes were okay.  Great service.",

Started off with the steamed dumplings, they were ok nothing special - they desperately needed a sauce as they were just served in a bit of their own cooking water. Then we had the fried pork with chili and garlic, it was excellent; super crispy and had a little sweetness. The classic Jjajangmyeon noodle dish was not as great, the noodles had excellent texture but the black bean sauce left a little to be desired. The flavor just wasn't fully developed and was a little bland. Overall the food was good but not great. The crispy pork dish saved the day. 3.5/5 stars leaning towards 4",

Before our food came out they brought out the side dishes which included daikon, raw onion, pickled cabbage and the black bean paste to dip the onions in.  Next came the khampoonghi. Since the shrimp one was not included in the lunch special, we could only choose from pork or chicken so we opted for the chicken. It was just okay not great not bad. Doesn't come with rice so you can also ask for a side of rice.  Next up the black bean noodles. Usually when I eat this dish at other places the black bean sauce is a little thicker. This one was really watered down. Felt like I had my noodles in watery soup and the taste was just bland. There was really no flavor.   Not sure if the reviews are so high because they give you a free item if you leave a review on Yelp and/or if we just had a bad batch this time.",

The jjamppong here is spicier than most places and isn't sweet, which I prefer. Although it has a spicy kick that lingers in your throat, it's very flavorful and you'll keep wanting to go back for more. The jjajjangmyun is delicious as well and the noodles are very bouncy and cooked well. The portions here are pretty big, especially for the low cost, which is always a plus.   The service here is a hit or miss. When I eat alone here, the staff doesn't really bother to come often to my table. The waitress was busy helping other tables that she completely neglected me. It took about 15-20 minutes to get her attention for my check. On top of that, she didn't bring my change for another 10 minutes. However, when I came with a large group, there were 2 workers that were designated to our table, and they were very attentive and nice. If the other staff are as welcoming and professional as our waiters that night, I'll be back more often.",

The jjajang came with raw onions and pickled daikon. I just threw out the onions, but I loved the radish. I mixed the sauce into my noodles and dug in. It's hearty like an authentic marinara, but of course doesn't taste like that. It's hearty with some saltiness to it. Almost like a gravy, but with that meatiness in it. The buns were good for extra sauce. The fried gyoza were exceptional, being actually fried instead of just pan cooked. They looked to be made in house, which was a nice surprise. The one thing I didn't like was how this didn't feel like a meal on its own. While it says it includes veggies and pork, that's just parts of the sauce that didn't get strained out. Next time I'll be sure to eat with someone else and also get a protein or veggie dish to supplement the noodles. You live and you learn, I guess!",

    "text": "Came here because I was craving black bean noodles. The restaurant inside is cute and cozy. I liked the decorations and dining ware here. We ordered the steam dumplings, the sweet and sour pork, and some black bean noodles. I loved the steamed dumplings. It was delicious and perfect. Their hot tea was good too and it was served in cute cups. I enjoyed the side dishes with the pickled veggies, onions, etc. The pork served with sweet and sour sauce was good. It was crispy and good texture. The black bean noodles was decent. The noodles were good but I would have to say the sauce was kind of bland. The sauce could definitely use more flavor. Overall it was a good meal. I will like to come back and try other dishes.",

    "text": "Loved this place! So we ordered 3 items: the large size JJajangmyeon, the fried dumplings, and the Ma Pa Tofu Bap. Everything was delicious lol. I would say my favorite was the Ma Pa Tofu Bap - I loved the smoky flavor and it also had a nice kick to it, but not where I was reaching for my water immediately. I've always loved JJajangmeyeon since I first tried it in D.C. and theirs here does not disappoint. The black bean sauce is bomb! The portion sizes were all great, I was stuffed afterwards. We didn't even go to happy hour and I think that we paid a great price. For all of that our total was $32 (we didn't order any drinks) for 3 people. It always makes me happy when delicious food is also super cheap. Will definitely be back to try more things because the menu is pretty extensive.",

    "text": "I wouldn't say that I'm a Korean-Chinese cuisine connoisseur per se, but I've had a lot of jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) in my days where I can distinguish the good ones from the bad ones. The good ones probably use a lot of MSG tho.  When I first heard about YuXiang, I was so excited that there was going to be a legit Korean-Chinese restaurant here in Vegas, and when I tried YuXiang for the first time, I was pretty impressed with their food. Their jjambbong and jjajangmyun were solid (generous portions of noodles, vegetables, and seafood and flavorful jjambbong broth) along with their tangsuyuk (sweet and sour crispy pork) and kkanppong saewoo (sweet and spicy deep fried shrimp).   However, I returned a couple times after that, and the food was wildly inconsistent. Once, the jjambbong soup had no flavor and hardly any seafood in it. Another time, the tangsuyuk was way overcooked, and the batter to meat ratio was all batter, hardly any meat. I also feel like the quality of their food has dropped significantly since their debut. Not sure if they changed chefs or not but please try to keep the food consistent!  Service has always been good tho so props to all the servers.",

Win for everyone, if you ask me. It's cooked to p e r f e c t i o n, it's rich and high quality meat and no weird fatty little nothings. Just so good.",

Great spot for Korean twists on Chinese food. Service was on point. We asked for a lot of different extra items, such as bowls, extra napkins, a side of rice, and the servers always had a smile on their faces and were happy to oblige.  My only gripe would be that the seating is a tad uncomfortable, as the chairs are wooden, and the tables have a low bar which hits your leg in an odd spot if you cross your legs.  Everything was wonderful, though. Great food, great and efficient service!",

A lot of chinese restaurants don't give side dishes, but here they do! *yay!* By the way, their portion sizes are very generous; good amounts of food on one big plate!   My boyfriend & I enjoy eating chinese/korean food, so we both decided to try out this new place while we drove down to LV for a short trip. I have to say, I'm glad I went down to LV because I was able to experience their delicious & appetizing dishes and an amazing atmosphere. Love it!!!    Five stars for you guys!  Thank you and we will come again when we have the chance to!   P.S. You guys should open another one here in Irvine. There's only like two(?) chinese/korean restaurants here in Irvine from what I know, and I can't even compare it to your restaurant.  Have a nice day! :)",

The music of choice (Korean pop/top 40) was a brilliant touch.   The food didn't take too long to come out, which initially concerned me. That quickly went away the moment I had the first bite of my food. Dinner was delicious!

I only get to come here when I visit my friends because they live in this area. We went in during happy hour and ordered a bunch of dishes (5 dishes) and they were sooo good. Also reasonable prices and portions are pretty big as well. We were all happy with the service and food.   Highly recommend this place! Wish I live closer to this restaurant so I can order via Uber or Postmates so I can enjoy delicious good at home.",

They saw us leaving and do not care at all.  We will never go back to this restaurant again. Terrible service!!

    "text": "YuXiang Korean Chinese Cuisine  It's been awhile since I reviewed on Yelp.. but I'm really disappointed this time.. and in general, I really like the restaurant when I visited the first time [no review]..   The foods are delicious! All of the noodles + tangsuyuk are the bomb! And also the most recommended. But recently I got the Mapo Tofu. But it's delicious as well.   However what's the point in going to a good restaurant that serves delicious food, when the service is terrible?   Not even once, the servers checked on us and see if we needed something. Unless we physically have to get somone's attention. And, it wasn't busy. So, I don't know what was the issue? But, I know I won't be back for awhile.",

YuXiang Ambiance & Service:  The dining area is Chinese style housings.  Dark Wooden tables and chairs paired with predominately red color scheme and Chinese murals with tall ceilings makes for an attractive dining area.  Our server was extremely helpful with picking out the popular dishes and answering our questions on spiciness and sweetness.  The kitchen got our dishes to the table quickly which was impressive considering how intricate and fresh the dishes were.  YuXiang cuisine:   steamed dumplings - 6 in a serving and they were tasty shumai paired with the spicy mustard was a hit.   Spicy Seafood Shrimp Soup - The perfect amount of spice that enhances flavor but doesn't burn the mouth.  This was loaded with shrimp, squid, clams, etc Sweet and Sour Pork - fried perfectly and we kept the flavorful sauce on the side for dipping. Chili Garlic Beef - A delicious dish and the garlic works so well here. jjajangmyeon - A popular dish with great justification.  The noodles were fresh and the black bean sauce was savory af.  This will definitely be a staple on future visits.  Overall YuXiang really nailed it on their sauces and seasoning on all the dishes we tried.  Nothing was too bold or bland and they have their system down.  I love the Korean/Chinese concept as it makes for some great options and dishes.  We'll be back to try more dishes, enjoy!",

Parking was easy and the place was pretty empty when we arrived and desolate when we left. My guess is they do most of their business at dinner.   It's called Korean Chinese for a reason - it's owned and operated by Koreans but they also prepare Chinese. Two in my party ordered traditional Korean dishes and were very pleased. I ordered mapu tofu and it was good, but I've had better. The lunch specials were really good values - lots of food for great prices.   Service was acceptable. Recommend.",

    "text": "YuXiang is an establishment that specializes in Korean/Chinese food. It's essentially Korean food as we know it. The best part of YuXiang is that they do have a happy hour! They have happy hour everyday starting at 9PM. I think we only dine here during happy hour -- we rarely come during regular business hours.  They do have a wide variety on their happy hour menu but we primarily come for their jjajangmyeon. Jjajangmyeon is black bean sauce with noodles and in Korea, it is super cheap, like $3 cheap. However, in America, that is never the case BUT at happy hour, it is $5! It is my husband's favorite Korean/Chinese dish.  For me, I LOVE YuXiang's BUL JJAMPPONG. Jjamppong is Korean spicy seafood noodles. But BUL means FIRE so naturally, the dish will be even more spicy. They do not have this on happy hour, which is a bummer but I always order it anyways. They have a regular size for $11 and a large size for $14. If you can't eat spicy stuff, please don't try this. It can be pretty spicy but it's so really delicious.   Another one of my favorite items is the gan jjajang, which is on happy hour for $8. It's pretty much the same as jjajangmyeon except the sauce is stir fried with more onions and veggies. It has a nice yummy aroma to it that is a bit different than the original. It is also less saucy. I tend to like the gan jjajang more because there usually is more flavor to it.   We've also tried their tangsuyuk, fried dumplings, kkanpung fish, kkanpung chicken, and kkanpung shrimp. My favorite is the kkanpung shrimp. It's pretty much a sweet and sour sauce over deep fried shrimp.   YuXiang is definitely one of my favorite places. I LOVE noodles and I walk out full and satisfied each time!",

The seats are kinda creaky and the tables are a bit uncomfortable but it was still just ok.  The happy hour menu consisted of some $5 dishes and more $8 dishes. I decided to get the $5 jjajangmyeon and shared a $8 Tangsuyuk. Others got the same thing.  I've tried lots of jjajangmyeon all around, and this place has some pretty good noodles! The noodles were the perfect texture and so was the sauce! I like more of a less starchy black bean sauce and this place was that. It had a good balance of savory and sweet for the sauce, and the portions were pretty nice for $5. Also, the tangsuyuk was bomb!!! Good portion for $8 and the texture was just perfect! Crispy and chewy mmm. Probably one of the best I've ever had in my life. The sauce is pretty on point too.  Definitely would come again!!!",

    "text": "I was hyped up about going to this restaurant. I didn't know this place existed until a friend of mine told me to check it out. As a Korean, I'm a big fan of Korean Chinese food, as most Korean would agree, it has a special place in most our hearts. Growing up in a city where Korean Chinese restaurants are as ubiquitous as fast food restaurants, I've had my fare share of Jjajangmyeon and Jjamppong. Not to mention I've lived in Korea for several years as well. But enough about me...  My wife and I decided to go to Yuchiang Korean Chinese Restaurant on a recommendation from a friend of mine who actually lives in Los Angeles. We arrive at 9:00pm which happens to be the start of Happy Hour and goes until they close at 1am. Strange happy hour times but nevertheless I'm happy I came this late. Their happy hour menu boasts a wide variety of specialty menu items in half portion sizes. We ordered the standard Korean order from the happy hour menu (a Gan Jjajang, a Tang Su Yuk, a Kkanpung Shrimp) and a full-sized Bul Jjjamppong from the dinner menu.   The Gan Jjajang: The smoky charred flavor of the pork and vegetables complimented the black bean sauce very well. The noodles were well executed but nothing to write home about. The combination of the noodles and sauce mixed together seemed a bit dry for my preference but Gan Jjajang is typically drier than your standard jjajangmyeon. I give this dish 4 stars.   The Bul Jjamppong: This noodle dish is a bit spicy even for someone who enjoys spicy foods. It had more of a peppery heat that doesn't linger very long so as long as you like spicy foods, this should be bearable. The noodle were similar to the gan jjajang but the soup was very tasty. The combination of seafoods from squid to shrimp to clams infused into the spicy, slightly salty, smoky broth made an excellent jjappong. I give this dish 5 stars.   The Tang Su Yuk (aka Sweet and Sour Pork): This is the standard Korean side/main dish to accompany a noodle dish. This is basically battered and fried pork tenderloin strips with a vegetable and fruit infused sweet and sour sauce. The portion size was decent. The batter on the tenderloin was a bit soft for my taste. Usually I like my tang su yuk a bit crispier and crunchier. The sauce was just your standard sweet and sour sauce. I would say it was average so I give this dish 4 stars.   The Kkanpung Shrimp (aka Kung Pao Shrimp) This is another popular menu item for Koreans. The size of the shrimp was at most a 26/30 in other words about the average sized shrimp you see on an entree. The sauce on this dish was a bit lacking for me. It tasted a bit pasty and felt like it was missing something. I give this dish 3.5 stars.   Overall, the dining experience was good. The service was good and the food was probably the best Korean Chinese  in Las Vegas so I will definitely be returning. Excited to try some of the other menu items.",

You can have your head turned all crazy trying to get their attention and you wont, unless you blurt something out. They didnt check on us to see if everything was good. Really, this review should be 3 stars but the food was super yummy and it's hard to find a place in vegas that has decent chajangmyun. These black bean noodles were so good, that it was my first time ever eating every single piece of meat and veggie in it. My kids loved it as well. I'll update this post when we eat here again. Hopefully management sees and does something about it",

I ordered their jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) and their kkangpoong saewoo (tangy fried shrimp) to go. They pack the noodles and the sauce separately, and give you sides of their danmuji (pickled radish) and raw onions, which are classic side dishes at Korean Chinese restaurants. The jjajjangmyun was the shining star of this order. The small order of the noodles was a hearty portion and definitely a reasonable price. The kkangpoong shrimp was a little bit more on the expensive side. The noodles kept well during the 15 minute drive back to my hotel. The shrimp lost its crispiness (as expected) but the flavors were still there.   Definitely will be back! Ambience and decor in the restaurant are nicer than the other jjajangmyun restaurants I've been to. Would definitely be a regular here if I lived in Vegas!",

For me, it was a bit bland.. but then again everyone has their own preference. I did enjoy their dumplings tho. In fact, they are by far the best that ive had in town. The texture and flavor was perfect. Im glad they offer them frozen to take home..40 pcs/$20.. Well worth it. Decor is cute.. although the chairs seem cheaply constructed. Service here is great. They are very friendly and quick.",

The food was decent.  It's interesting as the dishes didn't taste entirely chinese or Korean.  It's kind of Americanized Chinese food more like PF changs.  We came after 9 to try the dinner specials.  The prices were good but the portions were quite small especially the shrimp.   Literally got 8 shrimps.   The happy hour isn't worth it.  I'll probably come back and try the normal dish and see.",

    "text": "It was Thanksgiving Day and we just arrived in Las Vegas while on our way to Zion National Park. We stopped in the plaza looking for a place to eat lunch. Almost every restaurant were closed, but we saw that YuXiang was open, so we decided to give them a chance. As we entered, we saw that it was quite empty given the holiday, but we were greeted warmly but the staff and seated in a private room area. The spacious decor had a very traditional style and everything looked quite clean.  Upon seating, we were given a plate of egg rolls on the house since it was Thanksgiving, a nice gesture. We shared between six people with orders of walnut shrimp, two bowls of Jajangmyeon, Jjamppong, and Tangsuyuk. Everything we ordered was quite delicious, my favorites would have to be the Jajangmyeon and the Tangsuyuk. The black bean noodles were perfect and the deep fried pork dipped in the sweet n sour sauce resulted in mouthwatering delight. The Jjamppong had plenty of seafood and it was good, but the spice level was seriously strong. The banchans were okay, but not great. Best one was the Korean yellow pickled radish, which is goes well with the Jajangmyeon.  While we were initially skeptical, the food turned out to be very delicious. The Korean and Chinese cuisine mix was great and proved to be an excellent meal. It was a perfect meal except for the banchans, which were a bit disappointing. YuXiang is a great restaurant that serves authentic Korean and Chinese food I would recommend them if you're in the mood for some Asian delicacy in Las Vegas.",

I'll be honest I've seen this place before but have no excuse why it wasn't on my radar. Weird cause it's so good.   Side note- if you are tall or like to cross your legs the tables kind of have a low frame so careful with that.   Food wise everything was prepared hot and fresh. There wasn't anything we didn't like although we ordered very basic. The orange chicken and pork fried rice hit the spot. Their Jap Chae was good too.   I am down to eat here again for sure.

The flavors are kinda mild, and it's certainly not the best I've ever had. However, their fire champong is seriously legit, and I can't get enough of it.  Several other notable dishes would be the fried rice, their fried dumplings, and orange chicken type of dish that was a super hit by everyone else at the table.  Service is generally great. When we had a bday party here once, the staff were very accommodating, and even played bday music for the cake.   Awesome!!!",

    "text": "To me, this restaurant seems considerably overpriced.  Maybe I will feel better about eating in next time instead of getting takeout though.    Mapo Tofu was weird, like a cornstarch-thickened sweet tomato soup, lightly spicy, with almost nonexistent meat.  I like the Mapo Tofu at Grand Sign Kitchen nearby a lot more, they use bigger shreds of pork than any of my dishes here had, bigger tofu, less and different sauce.    Could barely tell the difference between the $11 Japchaebap and $19 Gochu Japchae, the more expensive one was in a different container but the portion looked pretty much the same.  The pork is cut tissue-thin.  For the amount of cost, every entree should come with side dishes, not just 1 set of tiny tubs for the whole order.  The flavoring on everything was very mild (which may be to your taste).  On the plus side, everything tasted fresh and light, no 'old oil' taste.  Every dish we ordered has lots of onions to make the portions look bigger and one of the side dishes is onions.  Perhaps I would enjoy one of the fried pork dishes more, or soup.  I feel like this place has potential to be better.",

Noodle it self was horrible  Gochu japchae - not much meat just full of onions and bell pepper also sauce was too sweet  Yang jang pi- it was ok fresh ingredient but sauce was too sweet i feel like they use honey mustard for the sauce   three stars for the service and environment.

This place definitely isn't my go to spot for Korean-Chinese fusion but I wouldn't mind going again.  Today was my first time so I got a good variety of food to try out. I ordered the fried mushroom with rice, kkanpoong shrimp, jjajangmyun, and jjampong. My favorite out of the dishes has to be the fried mushroom on rice. The shrimp was fried in such a thick batter that the batter taste was a bit too overwhelming; the jjajangmyun noodles were a little thicker than I'm used to and the sauce didn't seem to really \"stick\" onto the noodles so I found myself spooning in the black bean sauce every time I took a bite; and the jjampong was just alright, there wasn't really anything too special about it.  The waiter was pretty friendly. He filled up my water very consistently and made sure we had everything we needed. All in all, I rate this place a 4/5. I WAS tempted to give it a 3 stars but with the fact that it just opened up, I feel like it would be unfair to be so harsh on the place.",

The servers are nice and welcoming. They put us in an inside booth which made my dad feel great since it gave us privacy. We had jajangmyeon with of coursw tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork). The jajangmyeon was really good and the tangsuyuk was so crunchy just the way I like it. They dont seem to serve red kimchi just white kimchi but it was delicious so I was very happy. This is definitely the best jajangmyeon place for me in Vegas. I should rate it 5 star but Mom asked for a glass of water but the server put the water in a glass where she drank sprite from which my mom thought was.. to put it bluntly a bit barbaric. I think she should be very careful with this. I dont think this is acceptable even in Korea so cultural differences should not be an excuse. The guy server that waited on us before her was polite and pleasant.",

The servings are huge, exactly how our family needs it to be since we always eat family style. The service has always been great (crossing fingers that it doesn't EVER go sour). Most importantly, the food is AMAZING!! Great authentic taste of Asian cuisine. Anyways, I happen to love it here. I hope this place continues to grow!",

My husband always gets the spicy seafood noodles or jjamppong. One thing that's really good is the fried pork dish or tangsooyuk. It's fairly big and it can be shared among 3-4 people! It's not too sweet and the pork is fried to a crisp which is great because if it was soggy it would suck.  This place also delivers but if you get the noodles it may not be a good idea because the noodles get hard and rubber like.   The side dishes are plain with kimchi, yellow radish, and raw onion with black bean sauce. The side dishes could use an improvement. I mainly order Togo and eat at home since I have better tasting side dishes hehe!  Overall we are fine with the food but it isn't super amazing.",

Tee decor and cleanliness, however, was really pretty and everything was spotless. Service was also on point as the employees would always come to check up on us, gave us nice friendly smiles, and even offered to help us pick some yummy things that we might like. We ended up going for this clear noodle dish with lots of good toppings on top (I honestly can't remember the name). It was a giant dish for 2 people (or 3 petite tummies), though I probably could've shared that and another dish since I was a hungry hippo. Food was done nicely and there were plenty of toppings (we mixed the noodles with mustard!) I wish I got to try the jajjangmyeon, but alas, we didn't have enough people. Price-wise, this joint is on the higher end, though maybe it's because this is Vegas? (I live in LA and you can find a lot of good-but-cheap(er) Korean/Chinese restaurants).   Overall, as much as I think the price could be a wee bit lower, this place still deserves a 5 star for excellent service, cleanliness, and well made food. Give it a try!",

This place serves Korean Chinese, meaning not authentic Chinese food but Korean styled Chinese food.   Food:  Jaengban Bokkeum Jjamppong (5 stars) comes with jumbo shrimp, squid and other assorted seafood along with noodles. Broth is fairly spicy even though they ask if you if you'd like it extra spicy, I think the regular spice way spicy enough. Good flavor and quite large size. You could probably get 5-6 small bowls out of this dish.  Jaengban Jjajang- (5 stars) I would especially recommend this dish. We got the extra large size and there was quite a bit. This dish is made with some seafood, pork, veggies and black bean. Sauce with noodles were absolutely delicious!! Favorite dish of the night.  Steamed dumplings (4 stars) - nothing special but good dish nonetheless. I believe this dumpling is made with pork and vegetables.   Baby bokchoy (5 stars)- good dish and very good portion. The thing I look for when I eat this dish is that it the bokchoy is very clean and does not have any sort of dirt near the stem. Looked at the pieces I ate and they looked pretty good! (You can tell I eat a lot of Asian veggies)   Tang su yuk (5 stars)- very good fry on this dish!!you could tell the oil was very fresh and the fry on the breading was done right. Highly recommend this di  Overall great spot and would definitely come here again!",

We really didn't know what to get so we ended up just getting the Samseon Jjamppong with white sauce, which had absolutely no heat. My husband liked it, where for me, I'd definitely like to try the soup with heat. I was surprised that I really liked this soup. The noodles were delicious and the broth had a miso color to it since there were no peppers. The seafood was cooked perfectly.  We weren't offered tea but had to wait a bit when we did ask for it. I believe the hot water machine that boiled the water wasn't working or something so they had to boil the water some other way. When they brought the tea out, the little kettle that they gave us leaked when we poured the tea so we got water all over the table.  We were never asked if we wanted anything else, instead the male server automatically asked if we wanted the check so my husband just said yes. I guess we're just used to other restaurants where they ask if you'd be interested in dessert.  All in all, I'm sure we'll be back to try the other entrees since it's fairly close to our house and we don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown.",

At Yu XIang, though, the portion size is very generous so this is a steal and a meal for the next day.  I opted for the jajangmyeon small portion.  I was easily full for about $7.50.  Couple this with a few banchan of radish and cabbage and onion, and the meal was great.  The entree was a little plain with just paste and noodle and small portions of meat and greens, but tasty nonetheless.  All in all, the meal was really good and service was quick and no nonsense.  The tables aren't the best for tall people though as they drop pretty low.    Yu Xiang offers soju and other drinks so it can be a family meal or a late night destination.  Either way, a nice, different, option in the food-centric plaza.",

Tangsuyuk was one of the worst that we ever had. This dish sucked! We thought the battered and fried meat was okay but the sauce was too basic and tasted odd. It was definitely missing some key ingredients. Not the typical tangsuyuk flavor. The kampongsaewoo was mixed with Korean red chili sauce (gochujang) which was odd too. We did not enjoy this at all. We thought the Jjampong was decent and so were the pork yakimandoo. The restaurant is clean and the service was good but as far as food is concerned, we didn't like it.

Unfortunately, the food and service only deserve 3 stars.   The japchae was slightly mushy and literally had an entire onion in it. I don't mind onion, but this was way too much. There was a tiny amount of other veggies. The flavor was okay, but not anything like traditional japchae.  The Mongolian beef was good. Tender and cooked well. The chicken fried rice was also pretty good. But neither were memorable.  The jajangmyun was a little soupy, flavor was okay, but again, nothing special.   We also ordered mandoo (which didn't have any sauce). Our total came to $57.  We sat down soon after arriving and a server brought us complimentary hot tea and ice water. They don't offer free refills on soda/iced tea (served in cans) which is a pet peeve of mine. Overall service was okay, not great but not awful.   Parking is also an issue here. There are 3 restaurants, a Dairy Queen and a few other businesses all sharing a small parking lot.   In my opinion, when you consider the price, quality of both food and service, along with the inconvenient parking situation, I don't see myself coming back.",

They offer traditional korean noodles at a great price. I highly suggest to give it a try.",

I'm very familiar with traditional Korean Chinese dishes.  I ordered jajjanmyun, gochoo chapche, and shrimp kkambung. Jajjangmyun was pretty good. I liked it.  Gochoo chapche was delicious. Flavor was great. It was missing meat though.  When I order gochoo chapche from other places most places have meat in gochoo chapche. But flavor was still great wish they put meats like pork or beef.  Shrimp kkambung wasn't good. It didn't taste like traditional kkambung. I was little disappointed by kkambung. Even color of sauce and taste was nothing like traditional kkambung. And I thought fried shrimp were little too greasy for me,  Overall service and happy hour prices were great.  Because I live close by the restaurant and there's no other traditional KOREAN Chinese restaurant near my location I would go back there.",

I was tired of @LasVegasPhil posting his scrumptious looking bowls of freshly made noodles every other week, so I went to see what the fuss was all about. The interior is very new and clean with fancy designed booths for extra privacy. Luckily, we had the privilege to sit in them since it was a little slow.  Our server was very nice... and pretty;) We were given suggestions for our orders to make sure we were completely satisfied. Too bad she didn't have a name tag or I would be able to express my creepy gratitude a little more Lol. Alex took one for the team and got their Jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) while I played it safe with the Samseon Gan Jjajang (seafood pork vegetables with black bean sauce). Both had it's own unique flavor being sweet or spicy. We balanced out all the carbs with some crisp Spicy Wings that weren't very hot, but packed great flavor.   Overall, I was satisfied with my first visit at XuYiang. I will have to come back to try more of their authentic Korean/Chinese entrees.",

I showed my husband and he knows that my love for noodles is ridiculous. So we decided to order to go...they have an online system but it's hard to customize such as no onions and such so we decided to just call. We were able to order with our specifications and the outcome was delish. There's a lot of protein and plenty of noodles when we got it. I would def recommend dining in though just because the seafood does get over cooked when you get it to go unless you live 2 min away. I was excited that I found a noodle place that wasn't the same.   We came back another time and I had ordered to go on our way there. They told me 30 minutes so by the time we got there we still had 10 minutes left. My husband went inside and he texted me saying that a to go order was ready! That was fast thinking that was ours. Well it turns out that the lady working there said it was NOT our order. He texted me 10 min later saying that he was still waiting. I asked him if we could cancel and he said he already paid since that was the 30 minutes that they had told us. He waited another 10min and that order that was ready when he got there? Yea that was ours! The lady didn't even apologize for making us wait another 20 minutes for food that was all ready ready. Not cool! This experience has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I think I'll be skipping this place from now on. Way to go for the bad service and parking kind of stinks there since it's a small lot.",

The dishes were ok.  My favorite was the potstickers.  They make them in-house.  It was their first day (a soft opening on a Tuesday) but it was packed.  (A good sign).  But the reason I give a 4 star...they didn't have any dessert ready...we were with 2 children who had anticipated dessert.  Service was great as well.  Definitely worth trying again once they get more comfortable.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch today. Been wanting to try this place because one of my favorite food is black bean noodles. I also saw that they had sweet and sour pork.  Arriving here their were a few tables occupied. No one greeted us at the door until after a couple of minutes. A young man pointed us to a booth and left. We waited a little over 5 minutes for the same man who I come and check on us and realized we didn't have menus. The menu is separated by categories which was easy to read and understand. Before arriving I knew I wanted to try their black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork. Luckily it was on their lunch special. We got the second to the last lunch special because it included the sweet and sour pork, black bean noodle and their spicy seafood soup with noodles.  The first dish was the sweet sour pork. They brought it out with the sauce on the side. Which I prefer because I like my pork to be and stay crispy. The sauce and vegetables was good. It's not the typical red or pink sauce that most places will have. All in all I would rate I a 7/10.  The black bean noodles was the second dish I tried. Honestly, this flavor was underwhelming. I felt that the noodles were over cooked and the sauce needed more flavor. I would rather eat the ones from Greenland market's food court noodles. 5/10 Spicy seafood noodle soup was spicy. I wish I knew to ask for a mild one. I did like it. Never had it before so didn't know what to compare it to. The only downside was the seafood was a little overcooked.",

    "text": "Ol the new Korean Chinese place. Had to check it out. Over all, disappointing.  Avoid the pick hours. Two of us had Jjajang myun and Jjamppong. For Jjajang myun, the sauce seemed ok but the noodle... it is obvious they reheated on hot water. Which also made the sauce watery... I think the noodle is the basic. I would understand on pick hours but it was the slowest time of a day. There were only two tables other than us. The service was good. The server, a skinny girl, was very friendly. I gotta give one more try but so far, i would rather go to the island.",

Perhaps the best one so far in my life. I can only give five 5 stars to this place since they've got all the basics right, in terms of *taste of the foods *great customer service *exquisite atmosphere *reasonable price point / You guys should all definitely try this place soon before they get too busy.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and while I won't say it's the best Chinese place I've had, it's one of the better in Vegas. It's especially nice that it's so close to home for me.  I've had the regular jja jang myun and the seafood jja jang myun. I think I prefer the regular. The seafood one was a bit bland for me. The fried dumpling is delicious... and I also tried the garlic (?) chicken (kkanpungi) and that was also pretty good.  On this last visit their a/c was down and ... it was not pleasant considering it was over 100 degrees outside. Regardless food was still good, despite sweating and eating.   If you're into spicy food, the fire jjam bbong is pretty spicy. It's more on peppery side, but beware... I only took a sip of the soup but my friend said although good, you may pay for it the next day",
