I love butter and you can taste the butter on Both the crepe and croissant. The crepe was more of a lunch thing even tho I came for breakfast. It was still an delicious experience.  They are both made to perfection. Additionally the interior is like walking into Europe, makes you forget you're in Vegas.   It's a must have if you like sweets and are in Vegas.

    "text": "I've never visited this establishment in person, I've only ordered delivery thru Yelp Eat24. I highly recommend Yelp's Eat24 delivery service. The customer service is beyond reproach!  It's such a luxury to have food this delicious delivered to your door! This bakery/cafe does the French stuff so well that when I bite into one of their Danish or croissants, I am transported to a sidewalk cafe in Mont Mart (please forgive the spelling), watching the artists and sipping my espresso. If you've ever been to Paris, you know what I mean!  I didn't like their croissant press too much. It was bland; no saltiness or acidity to punch it up, and was unpleasantly unctuous. It needed a saltier protein, or a saltier cheese, or perhaps a slice of tomato. The croissant was lovely though, crusty, flaky and cloud-like!  The quiche was good (tomato and bacon). Very small and deeper than what I'm used to, the flavors were very well balanced and not too eggy. I do think both of these items suffered because of the delivery time. Neither are well suited for delivery.  Now to the pastries. Ahhhhhhhhhh....... The fruit Danish (apricot, cheese, and cherry) are superb. Glistening with a light egg wash, beautifully browned. The fruit toppings, especially the cherry, are a perfect foil for the sweet pastry. The cherries were more tart than sweet; a marriage made in heaven! But the best? The chocolate and almond croissant! If you like almonds, this is a must! A flaky, buttery croissant stuffed with the perfect proportion of marzipan and chocolate. Almond is the dominant flavor, with the chocolate adding a wicked good accent. (No, I'm not from Boston, I just love that phrase \"wicked good!) Order up a bunch of these pastries and you can have breakfast on the Champs Elysees every morning! My only caveat is to be careful ordering items that are not well-suited to delivery. I'm looking forward to visiting this establishment sometime very soon. In the meantime, I'll keep on enjoying the luxurious experience of having a sumptuous French breakfast on my little patio in the middle of the desert. Before the worst of the heat descends. Why don't you join me one day?!?",

I yelped this place and was surprised it was the La Belle Terre Bread. I was pretty excited as I pulled up in the parking lot and activated the 10 percent check in discount. LBT Bread serves a variety of quiche, crepes, salad, sandwich and coffee but what drew my eye was the pastry case. I was so enraptured by all the yummy desserts that I went from being the only one in there to being sixth in line. I didn't mind though, it just gave me more time to take in the beauty of the pastries. I did have an axiety attack as each person ordered and the server headed to the pastry case. I kept hoping that they didn't order all of the items.  The only down side is the prices for pastries was not listed. In total for 4 pastries and 12  Macaroons I paid 31. I will be back to try the quiches and baked breads.",

We thought that this place was a hidden gem but we had to stop back by at 1000 to pick up my purse which I forgot and the place was packed.   The lady that helped us when we first showed up was nervous because the staff member that does the front line wasn't there yet.  She offered to try to make us a cappuccino but admitted that she really didn't know how.  By the time we figured out what we wanted the front line lady showed up.  She and the male owner had a heated conversation and we took our stuff outside to wait for our food.   My daughter got the raspberry cinnamon roll and it was delicious.  It wasn't doughy like American cinnamon rolls.  It had an almost croissant like texture and the bottom appeared to have been dipped in a raspberry liquid.  It wasn't overwhelmingly raspberry which was nice.   My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich that came on a baguette and had a side salad.  We thought the salad was odd but it tasted great! My eggs Benedict was the best I've ever had.  It wasn't bitter at all and the croissant was wonderful.  Mine also came with the side salad which paired well.   The macaroons were our dessert.  The lemon was our favorite but all were delicious.  We'll certainly come back on our next trip!!",

So we came to La Belle Terre - a bit out of the way (for us) but magnificently worth it.   The kids ate croissants. They large, flakey and buttery on the inside. The Florentine quiche was so good last time I got it again and the salmon quiche.   Everything is made on site, daily. You can taste the difference too. I'm a sucker for quiche. If it's on the menu I'm typically ordering it. Panera has good quiche. La Belle has elite quiche. All of the ingredients are present and forward. That's the best I can describe it. They warm them up if you want. I recommend it. It takes 6 minutes. And then, the cheese oozes. So good.   I should mention they serve Peet's Coffee. Next time I come, I'm trying the crepes.",

THEN... I found this bakery. I came here with a couple of hours to kill in between job interviews. I told the gentleman behind the counter that it was my first time ever being there and if he could recommend anything. He laughed and said, \"Just about anything.\"   I had seen the reviews on the danishes so I opted for a Cheese Danish and an Almond Croissant along with a Hot Chocolate. My first bite of the Cheese Danish was heaven. It was flaky and warm but had that delicious cheese center that I had been craving for YEARS. No joke - I wolfed that bad boy down. The Hot Chocolate was delicious. It was a bit on the thick and rich side - just how I like it. I saved the Almond Croissant for later (to eat wth my family with afternoon coffee). It was generously packed with the delicious almond filling and the almond slivers on top were far from sparse. The fact that I had to split it with my family made me bitter (lol) and made me wished I had bought more.   The bakery had plenty of room for seating - both inside and out. It was clean and I encountered only friendly, smiling faces while there.  I will definitely be back to try more on the menu (which is quite extensive) and to try some of the bread that I've heard so much about. I absolutely can't wait!",

No biggie, by the time we were done, they will be hot and ready!  Another nice new addition to the pastry selections at LBT is the CHOCOLATE KOUGIN AMANN which they introduced about a month ago, and is just as bomb as the original. Always great service here, and the baked goods been deliciously consistent. By the time I killed my Kougin Amann, The Cracknelle were being put out on a tray, hot and ready, and one of the guys were nice enough to have my order bagged up for me. This batch was a bit too long in the oven(Top was burnt, but the sides and inside was good)  I think the Cannelle have doubled in size too!  ALOHA!!!

    "text": "La Belle Terre Bread French Cafe is located in a strip mall on the west side of Las Vegas. It looks unassuming on the outside but when you walk through the door you are welcomed by the beautiful sight of  an array of pastries, cookies and breads. I've been to La Belle a handful of times and have always been delighted with my choices that ranged from sweets to soup.   This morning I chose the chocolate almond croissant because I haven't had one since my honeymoon years ago. I loved the combined textures of the almonds,  the delicate flakiness of the bread and the creaminess of the chocolate.  I paired it with a caramel latte which was my mistake . The latte was delicious but it was too sweet with the croissant . Luckily in the seating area they have complimentary citrus infused water . I sipped on that until I finished my dessert. The latte was savored while I was reading over articles on how to care for a Hedge Hog. ( I'm deciding whether they would make good pets) .   The other occasions  I've been here was to buy pastries for Valentine's Day. I appreciated the creativity especially with the Rose jello mold because it is something different that you don't see at the local grocery store. It was too pretty I didn't want to eat it...but we did.   It is also a great place to hang out with your friends on a chilly day. If you are not a coffee drinker the French Onion Soup was tasty. I appreciated the nice amount of bread and gooey cheese that topped it.   The atmosphere inside is very relaxed and inviting. You can also grab last minute gifts for the holidays while  getting a cup of coffee. They had peppermint bark, toffee , and specialty coffee for the foodie in your life.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times over the years and the food has always been hit or miss and the service has always been lacking in many areas. My visit the day before yesterday was not by my choice, it was a friend who suggested we meet up here for brunch. As I walked inside it was the same chaotic mess with customers all over and the tables and chairs cramped together. I had to move my chair several times just so the people sitting behind me could get by and the other side of the table was too close to the ordering line. You place your order at the register and then they give you a number to place on your table and they bring the order out. The guy who took my order seemed clueless as to the menu and prices listed. I ordered a strawberry Crepe with chocolate and toasted almonds and he added on each topping as an extra and when I told him that the menu clearly says it's $7, he actually went to get another employee to show them my order and then they were complaining in front of me about who was right. He then was told to correct the amount because the menu price was right and he suggested I get my order to-go. WTF?! I told him that I was eating here with a group of friends and he said ok. He then gives me my receipt and the other guy says he needs it back to complete my order. Very weird.   It's worth noting that the original owners of La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Cafe now own Delices Gourmands French Bakery on Sahara. Not sure if Gourmands has any ties with La Belle, but a lot of the pictures on yelp for both places show some of the food plated the same. Both use Peet's Coffee yet Gourmands was by far fresher tasting.   White Chocolate Mocha ($4.35 for large) - I'm not sure why, but my drink was put in a to-go cup and they were not out of regular cups because other people at my table who ordered before and after me were given normal cups. It's not like it makes the drink taste different, but it seems like the guy who took my order did it on purpose since he suggested I get my order to-go. They use Peet's Coffee, which I have no problem with if it tastes drinkable. This mocha tasted burnt and not fresh at all. It also wasn't very hot. Not worth the price tag.  Don't let the size of the croissants fool you, it was hollow inside. Not flaky and not worth it.  Croque Madame ($10.95) - Sourdough bread, dijon, bechamel, swiss, ham and melted swiss on top is what the menu describes, but not exactly what I got. This was a poor excuse for what they call a Croque Madame. The bread was so hard and crunchy and while a cheese crust is legit for this type of dish, it's not meant to be rock hard. I was given a fork and butter knife for my meal and that dull butter knife wasn't \"cutting\" it. There was some melted cheese in between the bread, but there was absolutely no melted cheese on the top and the bechamel sauce was really lacking. On my plate was also a basic salad and some potatoes that others at my table liked, but I personally found to be too overpowering with dill and mustard flavor.   My hubby had a strawberry crepe and he was disappointed with the 2 measly strawberry pieces they put on top. Crepe was cooked nice, but needed more berries for sure. As if all of this wasn't disappointing enough, there was more to come. My friend (she's written her review and posted a picture of proof of what she paid for) ordered before any of us and she asked the employee to suggest a dessert for her. He said the Fruit Tart, so she went with that. After some time went by another friend went up to the register to ask about the fruit tart and the guy says after looking at the receipt that they are prepping it in the back. This was odd to us because the fruit tarts were right there in the case, but we still chatted and waited. After a longggggg time my friend still had no fruit tart! When asking about it again one of the guys started waving his arm across our table pointing at my friend saying that it's her fault if she doesn't have a receipt. He wouldn't shut up and just kept very loudly repeating that she needed to find the receipt because if she didn't have it for proof that it was all her fault and not his. I as well the rest of the people around me were all stunned at this guys behavior. After he heard us discussing our frustration and another friend telling him that they were aware she paid for it and was getting it ready for her, he brings out a fruit tart and tells her very loudly that he wants her to know that she did not pay for it, but he was being generous and giving it to her free and then says \"you're welcome\" as he's handing it to her. My heart broke for my friend as she clearly didn't deserve to be treated like that. Nobody does! There are far better options not only around town, but nearby. I will never be back and if someone suggests this place, I'll explain why I must pass.",

It has a fun, quaint  atmosphere with incredible cases of treats all freshly made. We had the chocolate raspberry mousse tart and the lemon tart. Both were uniquely different but amazingly tasty! The crust was tender and flakey. The Chocolate Raspberry had whole raspberries in the center with a luscious chocolate mousse and a decadent chocolate glaze. They lemon tart again had a tender, flaky crust with a perfectly balanced lemon filling that was mounded up to balance the crust. As we looked around the cafe'  everyone's food looked amazing! We will definitely go back. Even though we live on the other side of town, this cafe' is well worth the drive.",

Now there are trays 1/2 empty with their idea of French pastries, no abounding bread baskets and the ones that are there are EMPTY! The cashier and one of the kitchen staff were busy arguing back & forth about a clients order as the line got longer; no more greeting with a smile, just a hurried \"hello\" with a scowl. It took 15 minutes to get a regular black cup of coffee 30 minutes  later we are still waiting for our Crepes.... the list of great disappointments is endless. 2 Thumbs down!

They are gooey in the middle with the perfect amount of crunch when you bite into them. The pear tart is not to be missed, it is delicate with the perfect amount of sweetness. We also tried a Losange, which was one of my favorites. The flaky croissant dough envelops a delicious cream cheese like filling that leaves you completely satisfied.   We soon discovered our favorite time to come was breakfast time! The breakfast sandwiches are a steal at $3.99. You get egg, cheese, and ham on a delicious ciabatta bread. It is the perfect size to fill you up, but leave you with room for one delicious pastry. My personal favorite is the cheese danish. I am admittedly addicted to cheese danishes, but they are hard to find. The danish here is absolutely perfect. It has a flaky crust and 2 giant dollops of cheese in the middle. It is the perfect ratio of cheese to pastry and so indulgent.   Do yourself a favor and give it a try immediately, you won't be disappointed!",

I was not disappointed!! The almond croissant I ordered was huge and delicious. The Peet's coffee americano was piping hot, and the person I ordered from was clearly the owner. This was a great place to enjoy some cafe time and get work done. And, I got a free cookie!! The crepes and pastries also all looked delicious - if I wasn't already so full, I would have ordered more food. This is a great oasis of calm and artisanal Sin City",

However, it ended up being a bit \"blah\" in consistency...I'd go there for the croissant.

    "text": "I admit it. I am a carb-aholic.  I am a bread snob.  Once you have tried freshly baked bread, it is hard to go back to boring old Wonderbread and the other preservative filled commercially produced brands.  The smell of freshly baked bread is intoxicating. They sell freshly baked baguettes, batards, rolls, french and sourdough loaves.  My household goes through a lot of bread every week, and I am afraid my kids are turning into bread snobs too. I haven't tried everything yet, but I'm pretty sure it won't be long until we do.  So far the french and sourdough loaves have been our favorites.    But, the bread is not what brought me into this lovely french bakery the first time.  It was the pastries.  Holy moly, are these addictive. On my first visit, I came home with a variety of perfect, buttery, flaky, melt in your mouth, pastries.  I had even bought 4 Cannelles for my family of 4 to share since we had never had it before.  Well, I ate my Cannelle in the car and it was so delicious I could not resist eating another.  I pondered splitting the remaining 2 that survived the drive home. for the family, but thought it would be better if I just ate all of the evidence instead.  I have since learned my lesson, and buy at least a dozen so the rest of the family can partake as well.  I have yet to try any of the soups or sandwiches because the breads and pastries grab my attention every time.  But, a quiche is definitely calling my name.  They serve deep-roasted Peet's coffee, the only bold coffee that can successfully give me the caffeine rush I need - which is why it is the only coffee I drink at home too.  The bakery itself is adorable and once you step through the doors, all of your senses are awakened- the scents of the fresh baked goodies, the shiny equipment behind the counter where all of the magic happens, and the warm and fuzzy feeling you get from a a great cup of bold coffee.  Service is very friendly, prices are reasonable, ambience is great, and there is free wifi- what else can you ask for?  *Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 33/100*",

The manager was very nice and boxed up the food, the sandwiches were good, but a bit pricey. For 2 sandwiches, a crepe and 3 small pastries it was $57.

This used to be an awesome restaurant that had wonderful food. My last experience here was way below par. I ordered a croque Monsieur--A dish I've had several times from them in the past. It was completely dried out and gross. Limp even.   We waited in line for a long time and then were immediately ignored when it was our turn to order. The people behind the counter were running around in a frantic hurry and it was very chaotic. They are not very friendly either.   I understand that they hired a new pastry chef. This bakery used to have the best pecan and chocolate chip cookies in the valley. Whoever changed the recipe has completely ruined them. The cookies are covered in grease, can't stick together, and fall apart. Obviously they need a lesson in how to cream proper amounts of butter and sugar.   I am disappointed about the changes. This place has gone way downhill. It has gone from being our favorite Saturday morning place, to a restaurant that we will no longer visit. We have  no reason to spend money on bad food and service. Sadly, the cookies are now really just a tragedy.",

    "text": "My husband and I wanted to try this place because we saw the amazing reviews. One day when we happened to be up super early (like 5:00am), we thought hey it would be a good time to try this place out for breakfast and pastries.  We got there a little after 7am and ordered a Montmontre Chicken Crepe and Bacon Quiche.  I enjoyed my crepe, it was a large portion and very cheesy.  My husband liked his quiche and said he would want to go back and try something else on the savory menu.  We then ordered a Bunch of pastries to go, and the selection looked really amazing.  We got canneles, pistachio bun, chocolate croissant, almond chocolate croissant, chocolate twist, and 2 chocolate pudding/mousse desserts.  I mean, we spent like over $40 on just the pastries not including our breakfast order.    Unfortunately, they did not seem fresh at All.  I think we are used to flaky, buttery french croissants from bakeries.... In fact, my husband has a family member that's a baker and he always said that the test of a good croissant is in the layers and the flakiness.  All of these pastries had the texture of squishy bakery items that are sold from Hostess or something in plastic packages.  Even the chocolate twist!  So every single baked item we bought was squishy and not flaky and did not taste fresh, and maybe overly sweet.  The chocolate mousse desserts unfortunately were also a little too sweet for me, and didn't really taste like a silky smooth real-ish chocolate.  My husband and I are dessert lovers but we couldn't even finish these and ending throwing them away.  And the canneles were completely burned and Black on the bottom like we've seen from other reviewers. Maybe it's supposed to be like that?  So the two stars are for the savory food, we thought it was solid. I couldn't give more stars because of the disappointment  in the baked goods. It's too bad because they looked really appetizing and they did a good job in presenting the dessert case.    For a flaky flaky croissant, so far the best I've had here is Jean Phillippe at Aria Hotel.... amazing croissants especially the almond croissant!",

You've heard of coffee dunkers.  If you forgot, now you've been reminded... Plus these pastries are still good 30 seconds in the microwave.  Yeah not kidding!  It looks like a lot of the rolls here are made from croissant dough.  I was observing the flakiness of the exterior, but the inside was seriously like a soft croissant.  I enjoyed these carbs!  My favorite is the pistachio roll.  I thought it might be the hazelnut or chocolate; hmmm surprised myself.  Get some if you haven't tried the pistachio roll yet.  Oh and with a cup of cafe too!  Gotta come back though.  They have quiche.  Wanna know why I like quiche?  Cuz it's a meal in one.  I told you I like food that has everything already mixed in; simplified - not lazy food, just easier to eat.  Right so I'm coming back for more quality carbs :P  What was shockingly awkward in a cute weird way was when the man asked if I would like anything else when I was trying to pay, he said \"I love you\".  Slow awkward grin and sideways eyes reaction.  Are French men like that too?  I thought it was just Italian.  Okay thaaaaanks :)  I'll just take my box of pastries and go...

They also offer different sandwiches and quiches. Pastries are beautifully displayed and each looks amazing. They do taste a little sweet, but not enough to deter me from them. There's something for everyone here.  Order up front and they'll give you a number tag to put at your table. I always see seating available, even when it gets busy.  I like that this French bakery is not as expensive as many others. They're even open late until 6",

We ordered two breakfasts and an almond croissant with two drinks. It was about 40$ The croissant was not made today, it was a little too hard and stale and my Paris crepe barely had a slice of ham in it and I asked for an over medium egg. It arrived so incredibly hard and burned it wasn't even funny. And yes I could should have sent it back but it should have never made it to my table. I ordered a iced coffee with Almond Milk. I know now it was cream I was sick rest of the day. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry banana crepe and fruit is in season and barely any fruit in it. You would think that with a grand opening it would be clean. The trash in bath was overflowing and sick filthy with spare tiles on floor. The widows were filthy. Not sure why it was closed for a few weeks. I am Very very disappointed and it won't be a place I take guests anymore.  So sad this is no longer a favorite.",

They changed owners and the quality is gone with them.. bought couple of pastries and honestly I think Smith's has better bakery than them.. Using fake \"whipped cream\" in a French bakery is sin! Yeap, it's the end of an amazing place.. for good.   First time today, I took home a Montmartre crepe and 2 pastries: choc raspberry mouse and a peach tart (that I still need to try later on). The crepe was absolutely delicious!! What a pleasant surprise this place is close home :) The crepe was light and fluffy and the filled was perfectly balanced and flavorful. After, I had the chocolate raspberry mouse. It was perfect! Not too sweet, perfect size. I can't wait to try the other dishes they have. I recommend this place 100%!! Love it :)",

This was my first time here and we went here for brunch, late morning on a weekend so some of the pastry choices were already out.  What we did get to have was a Chocolate twist, Hazelnut roll, Pain au chocolat, and an Almond chocolate croissant, they were all delicious.  The roll had a soft, not overly sweet, dough and the croissants had a buttery, lightly crisp and flaky pastry filled with tasty goodness.  I especially liked the Almond Chocolate croissant with its sliced almond and chocolate drizzle on top and almond paste and the melted bittersweet dark chocolate chunks in the filling...heavenly, decadent and satisfying.  I also had the Montmartre crepe which has chicken, swiss cheese, goat cheese, spinach, onions, and bechamel (I ordered without onions.)  This was also very delicious, nice and creamy from the cheeses and bechamel, and the not-so-heavy taste of the chicken and spinach.  One thing La Belle Terre does with their crepes is before they flip the crepe, they sprinkle on some cheese (I think cheddar) so the cheese crisps up in the batter when they flip it...it adds a bit of sharpness to the crepe and is very tasty.  There are many more things I want to try here and I'll be over in Vegas in a couple of weeks so I'll surely be here to try some and adding inches to my waist.",

He brought my friend and I, creme brulee and it was exquisite. It's actually one of my favorite desserts too( which he had no idea about!) Places like La Belle Terre are hard to find in a city like ours... most business owners don't actually care about their customers but this place is different and the owner is too. It was such a genuine experience my friend and I had- we sat there for hours enjoying ourselves. Thank you La Belle Terre!",

During a previous visit I saw a couple eating a delicious looking egg/brunch type dish. I asked what they were eating and they said the eggs benedict with a assuring nod of satisfaction.  Fast forward to my recent visit and since I was in the area and hungry, I decided to try the eggs benedict.  When I was about to order it, I saw it was eggs benedict topped with a horseradish sauce instead of a normal hollandaise. Even though I like horseradish I was hesitant of eating it as a sauce for eggs bendict, but I ordered it anyway.  I should have followed my hesitation. Even though there was ham, a croissant, and poached eggs, they only thing I could taste was the horseradish sauce. The sauce was good for what it was, but I was expecting something more traditional for a eggs benedict. I would want the sauce in a roast beef sandwich or something. The side salad that came with my meal was nice, and the house salad that covered it was excellent. It was kinda small though, even though it was the most enjoyable thing I ate I still would have liked more of it even if I had enjoyed the eggs benedict.  I'll still be back to get their bread and delicious pastries, and to try more of their meal options. I will just have to make a note to not eat the eggs benedict as long as it has the horseradish sauce.",

    "text": "When I first discovered this French cafe and bakery I was thrilled, and I went kinda nuts with the pastries ($45)--every one was delicious.  But my enthusiasm and the food has since  gone down hill. Over two month's time I've continued to order my favs and each time the quality differs. My first apricot danish was close to orgasmic- flakey, custardy, plump fruit - but my last few have been overly browned flakey, no custard to speak of, withered fruit. I have yet to be able to get a plain almond croissant, every one ends up having chocolate inside even though I keep saying plain. Same downward progression with the Monmartre crepe - creamy delight to gummy dry. Different bakers and off days might explain the problem, but I'm still pretty disappointed. BTW the onion soup is absolutely awful.",

I had a delicious Montmatre crepe with swiss, goat cheese, chicken, bechamel and spinach.  I wasn't even sure I liked crepes. Turns out, I do. Slightly rich and decadent due to the cheeses and bechamel (a cream sauce). It was a good portion and good value at $7.50.  Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for steering me here for brunch. This Euro gem did not disappoint.",

I purchased a chocolate eclair, lemon tart, raspberry and lemon slice, macaroons, hazelnut pastry and cannele's. Eveything was disappointing. The cannele's were burnt on the bottom and dry, the lemon tart tasted like they used lemon juice from a bottle rather than fresh lemon, the hazelnut pastry had a mealy aftertaste and were dry, the macaroons were literally hard as rocks, the raspberry lemon slice was dry and artificial tasting and the chocolate eclair had chocolate pudding instead of creme pat for filling and the top chocolate was hard, too much and way too sweet, you couldn't even taste the pastry.   I won't ever return and will never recommend anyone  go there!",

The cannelle were these little caramelized sugary bites of perfection that I couldn't stop eating and the almond croissant was full of tasty sugary nutty almond past and flaky layers of buttery pastry. Tasty sugary nutty? Yes.   We also had the french onion soup which was full of thinly sliced onions in a rich salty, rosemary broth. The Montmarte crepe... so many flavors of deliciousness fit in a thin dough. Chicken, goat cheese, caramelized onions and spinach all wrapped up in this crepe that has Parmesan crusted on the outside. I just ate this and my mouth is watering for another just writing about it.   See you next time lover.",

Had to pay in cash because their clover wasn't working so customer service was slim to none as they were all hunched over the cables on the front counter. Half their pastries were gone but it's my own fault for going so late in the day. Their chocolate twist was out of this world! And huge! Beautifully flaky and moist, delicious! Very filling so it's perfect to start the day. The sandwich was bland with too much bread. They were out of baguettes so I got it on ciabatta and that ruined it even more. The ambiance is very comfy and quiet even with a full house, which is what I walked in to. Wouldn't go again. They didn't use my 10% off check in when I showed it to the cashier. :(",

We're still working our way through everything this shop has to offer, but we've always been pleasantly surprised when we try something new here.  We've learned to visit this shop early - La Belle Terre frequently sells out of many items earlier in the day, and they close at 6pm, so we make a point to visit either in the morning or during our lunch break.  The seating is kind of tight here - it's a small shop - so we usually get our order to go, but be sure to get the breakfast sandwich for dine-in, since it doesn't include the salad when it's purchased for take-out.",

I ordered the Monmarte Crepe with a Vanilla Cafe Latte and my best friend ordered the Vol Au Vent with a hot cocoa, both were recommended to us by the girl that was taking our orders.   The coffee wasn't anything great. As a French bakery/cafe I was really hoping they had some good houseblend coffee or something. Which is why I gave a 4/5 star rating. They used normal Peet's coffee, so don't expect anything gourmet. But the food! THE FOOD! It was excellent. The crepe was delicious but the Vol Au Vent stole the show. The puff pastry, the chicken, the mushrooms, and the sauce they covered it with had the most savory flavor. It was amazing.   I 100% recommend this place and I will definitely go back because I totally forgot to buy some of their pastries on the way out.",

On this occasion I tried their Vanilla Latte and was given the choice of a paper cup or mug which I thought was nice because it definitely makes a difference with taste for me.  The coffee was delicious! And to go with my coffee I ordered a Pain au Chocolat which was also delicious puff pastry filled with chocolate.    We also waited for their famous Cannelles to come out of the oven which had approximately 35 minutes to go, but when they did come out they were burnt.  No other way to look at these or taste them.  I like burnt but these were just uneatable.  They were bitter and a shame to sell as is.     We also tried their Kougin Amann, both chocolate and original.  Both were good but a little on the hard side.  Then I tried my sisters Quiche which none of us could finish.  It had a foul cheese taste and was not even warmed up thoroughly.   The place like I said is cute, with nice seating and a good view into the kitchen, but was a little disappointed on this occasion.   The service from the cashier was also a little on the short side and not welcoming at all (older man with glasses).   I left craving a good Cannelle so hopefully on my next visit, all these oversights are taken care of and I can enjoy my experience and update this review with a  more positive one. We'll see.",

The space is clean and laid out in a serene manner that invites you to take your time sipping a cup of coffee, reading a newspaper (on your smart phone of course,) and tearing off buttery pieces of a croissant.",

I had been surfing Yelp for good breakfast places earlier in the week, and I had already bookmarked this place in anticipation...  First, the ambiance is adorable. It's very french, and many employees in the bakery were speaking to each other in French (and many customers were as well). Made you feel like you were in France picking up some fresh pastries!  Second, the prices are very reasonable! It isn't the cheapest place in the world, but the pastries are very affordable, as are the breads. For 3 bucks you can get most of the pastries (some are a little over $4 though), and you can even get a big baguette for that price. Everything looks perfectly fresh and delicious, and we will definitely be stopping by there for some bread this week!  Lastly, everything was DELICIOUS. Seriously, the cheese danish may have been the best danish I have ever had...and I have had a lot. It was perfectly flakey, the filling was unbelievable, and it was just the right size. The chocolate croissant was equally as amazing. The almond galette was very good, but I am not a huge almond fan. The chocolate twist was also really good, and a good value for the size. However I enjoyed the chocolate croissant more because it had more chocolate inside.  Wonderful local place that I will be back to!",

The French Chocolat Twist was surprisingly better than anticipated. The two sandwiches I got were better than I anticipated because I'm not a cheese person and yet I still enjoyed them.

    "text": "Abysmal.   Let me preface: I'm French-American, so I know my scene, and this was was an absolute disgrace to my people. It's shit like this that give ugly Americans and uppity Frenchies their undeserved reputations. We're good people, but these select few are ruining things for the rest of us. Also, this is why Yelpers need to stop inflating reviews. Dining should be simple: order, receive, STFU, enjoy. 3stars for that perfectly average experience. When it's *not* that simple, this is an example of how bad it can be. It's absurd. Read on.   I've been here three times and was looking for one more visit to round out my review. It was going to be a 3-star, an a-ok-nothing-wrong but nothing memorable location as the service is always frantic no matter how few people are in shop, with staff visibly unsure of who is supposed to be doing what.  Food is often mild, borderline tasteless, and overpriced for the old-school cheat of fattening you up on bread and serving bottom-bin iceberg lettuce for your side salad. My standard black coffee and croissant was a solid 3--just too bitter like it had been sitting on the pot for some time or cheap grounds used, and the croissant while moist in the middle was crunchy on the outside, not flaky, i.e., baked with too much moisture or too high a temperature.  The seating area is cramped, not cozy. That point will be of special importance here in a minute.   SO LET'S GET TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER. I came here with Trixie N. and several other YelpElites for a Sunday brunch. See her review for the full monty, but I'll add my confirmation and perspective. While ordering my breakfast, I inquired for Trixie about her missing fruit tart dessert which she had ordered (see credit card evidence to the fact).  When I asked the man at the register, he asked what her order number was.  \"Twenty,\" I said. I watched him turn around, look at the receipt that was still on the board with a big fat 20 written on it, he looked back to me in agreement, and said, \"they're working on that in the back and it'll be out soon.\" Ok, great!  An hour later as we eat slow, it's time for dessert. No fruit tart. So I ask the dude who looks like the manager. Per Trixie's review, instead of apologizing or investigating or assuming the customer is right, he begins to berate her in front of the entire restaurant, gesticulating and repeating, \"this is YOUR fault,\" while laughing.   Who the fk does that? That guy. NO exaggeration, he begins to point at her, JABBING his finger, REACHING across our cramped table to do so, causing a scene unlike any I've witnessed in a restaurant ever. Everyone can hear; everyone is watching. Over a GD fruit tart.   At that point, I put my hand on his shoulder and said, \"hey listen, friend, I told that guy over there at the register--and he confirmed--that it was ordered and on its way.\" He looked up, went over to talk to the guy at the register, and 'lo, a fruit tart then appeared. But, not without some additional snide remarks about how generous he was being, and some meandering bullshit story about how it's important to smile on Sundays (is the man an ass or just utterly socially inept?), and then he apologized for some 5-minutes straight while we sat waiting for this unwelcome dude to just leave us the hell alone. GO AWAY. Eventually he did. But sorry dude: too little, too late.   That was beyond repulsive. I'll never be back and while I know this place has its fanbase, I'll do my part to end the party.   Mediocre food.  Expensive for what you get. Cramped interior.  Service sucks, from top to bottom.  Manager should be fired, or if he's the owner, he should retire.",

The chocolate in both my sister and I's crepes was rich and creamy, giving the crepe that much more flavor. My dad's sandwich was very reminiscent of the ones we had tried in France nearly 2 years ago. This place is definitely worth a try if you're looking for great, authentic French food.

I saw other people get their drinks before their food orders arrived. The person was very sorry about our drink order and took my copy of the receipt and got going on our drinks right away. We pretty much finished our coffees before our sandwiches and pastry came (another 15 mins later) so we got some water. They were having some issues with service as two tables next to us were complaining about not getting the rest of their orders yet. One was missing her son's order and the other table was missing their soup ( I wasn't eavesdropping, they were complaining loudly).

Croissants are very time consuming and complicated to make, so I definitely appreciate the process of making a good one. There's a lot of butter in these suckers, there is nothing healthy about them. For me to consume one it had better be divine. In my opinion these were over done. The outside was so crispy it fell apart. It had a slightly burnt taste to it.  I knew upon seeing them that they were a bit dark for my taste. The middle was very airy, not a lot of substance.  This was a total miss in the croissant and that's what I am basing my review in, a French bakery messing up the quintessential French pastry doesn't bode will for the rest of the pastries which all looked a bit dry and overdone, in my opinion. I am no expert on French pastries but I am an expert on what tastes good!",

    "text": "I came here because I needed to work on some stuff before my dermatologist appointment in the same plaza.   The WiFi works well and the environment is nice enough. Not a ton of outlets l, but they're in there and it's not too crowded did a place at lunch on weekdays. There's also a nice patio area for anyone who wants to be outside.   The reason for my 1 star review is that the food was incredibly disappointing and not even close to what was advertised on the menu. I ordered a Turkey Panini which was described on the menu has containing turkey, brie, and cranberry. For one, the turkey was the deli style Oscar-Mayer-esque sliced cold cuts type. Really disappointing but technically, yes, I guess it's turkey. As for the Brie cheese, I'm not sure if it was really even Brie. The cheese didn't really taste like brie, and I've also never seen Brie served as a neatly cut square slice (kind of like a Kraft American single). The most upsetting thing was the cranberry wasn't even in the sandwich at all. It was just the turkey and the cheese. For $10, I expected a bit more quality than what I got. Honestly I could get a better panini at Starbucks for a fraction of the cost. I was going to come back and try some coffee after my appointment, but the meal itself was discouraging enough to convince me otherwise. I probably won't be back. Don't really have a reason to.",

Also, my daughter clearly enjoyed her Nutella crepe judging by her empty plate and messy face.  And we just couldn't pass up the French Macaroons they had--Raspberry, blueberry, & chocolate.

He's a coffee person & I'm a pastry person. So we both got what we love. First thing I saw was that they served Peet's coffee. That was a plus. I love Peet's over starbucks. The coffee was amazing. If you dine here they serve your coffee in a coffee cup with a little saucer underneath. That's real coffee house status.  I was excited to see all the French pastries they had. I ended up with an almond croissant.  OMG! To die for!  We met David the new owner and a very nice man who introduced himself and chit-chatted with us for a bit. This place also serves delicious breakfast plates that look amazing. We love this place! All the staff were so nice and helpful and I can't wait for next Sunday to come!",

I've had lots of stuff from here and everything is actually pretty good or better but the one thing all my friends seem to agree on are the pecan cookies and croissants to go lol. The prices are really competitive too!  I say \"mostly fresh\" because you can't have say, a chicken breast added to a salad for an up charge or anything. I got the chef salad and was very surprised to see very processed ham and turkey next to such beautifully fresh lettuce and hard boiled eggs but their turkey and brie on croissant is really nice and I love that they serve their sandwiches with little salads. My friend loved her croque Madame (I didn't try due to my aversion to sunny side up/runny egg) and I liked the Monsieur part of it anyway :). All of their pastries are pretty delicious but their breads are very very good on their own too. One of the workers was a bit over attentive to my busty lunch mate one day but hey, we got extra good service that day so whatevs lol. If you're on the fence, it's safe to jump.",

The staff even had an accent to go with the great smelling pastries!  I decided to order a florentine croque monsieur. It was dense and savory, definitely belying its size. Don't be so quick to judge how small it is. Le croque monsieur - which came with a plate of sliced baguette and butter - were very filling. I didn't even have room to order a drink to go with em'!   This gem is the creme de la creme of Vegas cafes. Find it on the corner of sahara and Durango where Paymons patio dining can be found. C'etait fantastique!",

    "text": "If you are looking for French without the price that tends to be attached to French food in Las Vegas, look no further, La Belle is for you! Located in a shopping mall on West Sahara, La Belle beckoned me while I was traversing the area looking for a hair salon I had never been to, but had an appointment with.  After my hair appointment my hunger led me to La Belle. What a great choice I made. La Belle is French, and down to the core French indeed. It is a bakery/cafe, serving up loaves of bread, sandwiches, soups, salads, and patisseries. I got the turkey, brie, apple, and walnut sandwich on their cibatta bread. The brie was very tangy, not the same 'ol brie you are used to everywhere else. I was actually taken aback by the tanginess of the cheese. Yes, my friends this is *True* French food.  La Belle also serves Peet's coffee and they brew it with their own water. Yes. They have a specialized filtration system that all of their water runs through. I learned this from a \"factoid\" sheet in the bathroom. Well. I'm impressed.  I also left the cafe with two tarts - a blueberry and an apricot which I will be sharing later with my husband. From the looks/smells coming from them I imagine they will be delicious.",

Also, their single shots of espresso are a must for individuals on the go. Their service is awesome, the staff here are always friendly!  Their food is ammmmazing and same with their prices. Their rustic sandwich which is hard boiled egg, pesto, and prosciutto is a fave even though I end up taking off half of the meat because it's too salty for me. Their quiche on the other hand is a 5/5 for sure. Their turkey and Brie or Swiss Paninis are super good too but super plain so ask for like a slab of lettuce and tomato since it's literally bread, meat, and cheese. I definitely need to check out their pastries though and stop eating so much here so I can make room.",

When we spoke to the manager, he said that this employee was the owner's friend, and that it was the only reason he was still there.

I got:  - White chocolate creme brulee - It was premade, so no crunchy top layer. Despite that fact, the flavor was just spot on! It was rich in flavor, yet light on taste. It is hard to describe, really.  - Raspberry chocolate mousse - I was trying to choose between the cheesecake and this...and the manager was very definitive about his recommendation. I thought the raspberry flavor was a bit much (thick, raspberry jam-like), but the chocolate mousse was wonderful. Again, a premade item which tastes like it has been sitting in the case for a while.  - Iced coconut macadamia latte - It was very good. Refreshing. Might be more so in the dead of summer (we were here close to New Year's).  I wish I'd gotten pastries. By the clientele, many of whom were French-speaking, I would say that this place is on point for a traditional French bakery. Yum!",

    "text": "Ok I am tempted to give them one star after my most recent experience.  Let me talk about the bad then I will roll with the good about this French bakery.  I stopped in this morning to grab my normal small baguette with brie and a small latte.  To my dismay they have raised their prices on my little bit of paradise.  Now I don't want to be overly critical and I am willing to pay for good food and or service but this isn't right.    Normally I pay $1.30 for my \"roll\" and .50 to add brie.  The \"chalk board\" menu states \".50 to add to any item\".  Today the lovely gentleman charged me $5.50 for my bit of brie.  When I confronted him he said the prices on the board are not accurate so he handed me a paper menu with the update prices.  Ok, I'll accept that but this new paper menu says \"$1.00 to add things like butter, jam...\"  I ask why he didn't charge me the $1.00.  He said I created a sandwich. I reminded him I come in once a week for my snackwich and what I pay.  He said if I didn't like it I don't have to take it.  Not very customer service oriented.  I just think that the \"chalk board\" menu and the paper menu should reflect proper prices.  I added cheese to a roll.    Ok enough with the negative.  This place has awesome food.  From the Croque Madame to the Croque Monsieur.  These sandwiches are insanely tasty and are served with a small side salad and a great balsamic dressing.  The coffee/espresso is way better than any Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf you may enjoy.  They offer great sweet treats and quiche too.  Parking is pretty easy at this place.  They do have bike parking and an outdoor sitting area.  You could bring your pup to hang out while you eat your great meal.    Todays snafu won't stop me from coming here.  Yes I'm annoyed but I'm not chopping my nose off to spite my face...or tastebuds....",

La Brea Bakery and Bouchon have one of my favorite french baguettes.   I got  overly excited when I set my eyes upon their twisty french baguette bread. It looked exactly like the one they serve at Bouchon, and I thought, \"I won't ever have to go eat there just to get this bread if this one fits the bill!!!!!\" Well, it looked the same, but it certainly wasn't as good. The flavor of the dough was an A-OK for me.    Harvest french bread- I wasn't too fond of the flavor at all. It's got a major multigrain thing going on, and I like that on my regular toast, but not for a french baguette.   Quinee Aman?- It was good, a solid 4 star. I have had better however.   Some sponge bread that is soaked in a ton of sugar water type deal with whip cream on top- 5 star. Sorry I can't remember what this was called, but I do have a photo. I felt like I was getting sugar high after 2 bites, but it was so worth it.   Service was great. I will be back to try more.",

The fruit cup had fruit that i actually enjoy in it, the cinnamon rolls are massive and so yummy, and the bacon is always an added side bonus. The latte wasn't bad either! But now I will never go there again!!!! I'll find somewhere else with food just as good who knows how to treat their customers..... at least online!!! Can't imagine what she says in private. What a dumbass... saw reviews saying this place used to have lines out the door, it's always empty when i go. I guess everyone got hip. Good service is something i look forward to in Vegas, a service town, so i will gladly take mine somewhere else & NOT continue to recommend to ppl. Ew. What a turn off. & Sandra don't bother replying, spare me your shitty sarcastic \"business owner\" remarks.",

From the pastries to the sandwiches, the Chef brings that little piece of Paris you want.   Where they could improve is the quality of their coffee and the long/slow lines at the counter. The coffee is too big chain for a place that's supposed to be Paris Cafe. As for the slow line, it's the main reason we don't come back weekly...  All in all we love this place, just needs a little fine tuning",

I've worked for a top french bakery in the past so I'm kind of snobby when it comes to the simple french eats. But was super impressed with the selection offered and legit bread production going on just behind the counter. Cute and cozy atmosphere and plenty of hearty breads to eye.We ordered a few different sandwiches and an almond croissant. Food was prepared quickly and in one word delicious. Croissants were flaky and just the right of buttery. Bechamel was creamy and seasoned perfectly as well as the egg execution. The reason for a 4 star vs 5 review was all in the details. I ordered a cafe au lait to accompany my food selection. The Peets coffee served in a paper cup did not fit the overall style of the bakery. The plastic plates were not much bigger than the food they held which made for a difficult task of cutting a cheesy saucy crunchy goodness of a sandwich with a butter knife. And the booth seats to table height ratio was slightly awkward. My stomach and I will be returning none the less.",

My previous encounters have only confirmed what I've feared for some time now...my palate has gotten snobby ;-)  I am so very happy to report satiation. I have in front if me the remains of a delicious breakfast. Now before we get to the yummy details, I must say to any who want to be successful business owners please, act like you want my money.  I'm here because I want to spend some money & I walked into your establishment because I'm thinking about spending it here.  If you want me to give it to you, then please, please act like you want me to.  Times are too difficult for you to act as if you're already set.  I am a firm believer in getting the best quality food you can afford.  La Belle Terre has some of the finest quality pastries i've ever tasted. For my breakfast I chose a blueberry tart, cherry danish, and hot chocolate (hey, I'm indulging in Las Vegas).  As I sat outside enjoying the mild breeze and warm sunshine with another plump blueberry  between my teeth I couldn't help but smile.  Yes, there are still people who care about serving good food.  Yes, there are business owners who care enough about their business not to neglect a plain and simple fact, I am here because I'm thinking of spending money here so, make me want to.  La Belle Terre makes me want to keep coming back every time I visit Las Vegas.  I think I will! :-)",

Pastries and breads are good and well presented.  I have spread the word about this cafe to my friends in and outside of Las Vegas and voila, they do visited the place because of my recommendation.  My friend and I frequent the place because of their Peet's coffee and our favorite Palmier (Elephant Ear to some).  However, the more we have our coffee there, we noticed that the taste is getting sour and bitter.  This happened three times.  We made complaints about the taste and unfortunately, it seemed like they were not happy about it.  Being consistent customers, we were thinking that they will be accommodating with our complaints but we were given cold shoulders.  We stopped going until we decided to give them another try.  We missed the place that we thought of ordering our fave coffee.  This time, coffee is great!  We will be going to this local French Cafe once again.  Afterall, we want to help local businesses.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this lovely place for the 4 years we have been living in Las Vegs.  FANTASTIC that the new owner Sandra has recently taken over this bakery/cafe.  She is doing a great job to make this cafe higher on our eating list.  Sometime about a year ago the ownership changed.  So it did enough to make us come less often.  That changed today.  We noticed right away some things were different.  And the rude/disinterested person taking ones order was gone.  Sandra took our order.  She seemed interested and appeared to take care to serve us properly.  When she came by the second time to make sure we had everything we needed, I asked her did she recently start working here.  She said YES.  However she was the owner.  We had been there just before going to Europe for a month.  France being one of the stops.  This was early April.  So she came since then.  My answer to her was that everything was perfect finally.  We used to come and have great pastries and breads.  Today we had a  usual lunch:  a croque-madame and an onion soup.  The croque-madame was rich and tasty.  A fabulous grilled sandwich of ham and cheeses with a fried egg on top.  We have had this sandwich in France.  We've said that we did not have to go to France to have this sandwich.  We could not say this for the last year.  Now we can say this again.  It's REALLY GOOD.  If you like onion soup like me, ORDER THIS!  It's vegetarian, does not taste like a veggie onion soup.  It is BEAUTIFUL.  The Gruyere cheese on top was what I like.  If you want beef stock, you may not care.  I'm a meat eater.  I just want it good.  And it is.  This is a simple dish that is usually without flavor.  This delivers.  The pastries looked good as they always do.  I'll come back soon to see if they taste as good as they look.  Also, Sandra said the breads do not have the adulterants in them like most in the US does.   These I'm told put on the pounds.  I hope that's True as I love bread.  It shows.  So I'll be trying them soon.  Sandra also speaks about 6 languages.  One of them French, of course.",

We tried the croque Madame, Paris crepe, and chocolate croissant. The croque Madame was outstanding. The portion is large! The fluffy crusty bread had the perfect amount of Dijon, cheese and runny yolk. Yum. It can with a nice salad that was drizzled with balsamic. I would much prefer they toss it before plating as it is near impossible to coat it on your plate without knocking everything off. The crepes were light and delicious but cold. The chocolate croissant was excellent and the chocolatiest I've ever had. Hubby was pleased with his cappuccino but I was meh about my caramel latte. It was ok. I would have preferred a real cup for the dine in experience. I only noticed the posters of the seasonal specialty lattes after we had ordered. They were not listed on the menu in the ordering area. Bummer.   Service was slow and it was jamming in there! Do not go in a hurry. Plan to sit and wait and enjoy the bakery atmosphere.   There were so many other things I'd like to try so I will return soon to sample more!",

I told her what I really wanted was for them to pay better attention, after which the phone line mysteriously went dead. Yeah, she hung-up on me. While I'd like to comment on the food, I can't because it was eaten by the invisible troll in my back seat on the way home. Or it was never placed in the box to begin with. And I fscking tipped... So, I'm left with commentary on the service: it sucked, if I need to spell it out. Any level of acceptability in the shop was entirely negated on the phone.

I had lots of questions for Luis and he was so helpful and patient. I am a consumer that appreciates good customer service. I think if someone is patronizing a business and spending their hard earned dollar, that they should receive some appreciation from that business and/or their employees.

Being that we do travel extensively all over Europe we have had our fair share of fresh baked bread. You sound more of an expert on drywall, that's what the bread tasted like, maybe you should go back to that field of expertise.

I am a also a huge fan of his almond chocolate croissant, it's a perfect balance of floral/sweet. My grandfather loves the cherry danish!  What I can do without are the desserts in the cold case. I am a pistachio addict and I can see the green, too much green, but can not taste pistachio in the pistachio cake. I have tried a few other desserts and not cared for any of those either.  I did not care for their coffee either. I saw that they serve Peet's, however, maybe the machine is ill-claliberated because I my black iced americano was not very tasty =(   Will I be back? CERTAINLY!!! I just know exactly was to order!!!!!",

    "text": "La Belle Terre Bakery is one of those hard to find establishments that normally exceeds expectations.  On previous visits, Sandra and the rest of the staff provided my partner and I with exceptional service from start to finish. Sandra made us feel right at home by being especially charming in conversation and engaging with all her patrons.   She made some great recommendations and even offered to let us try a new pastry as a sample.  In terms of menu items, the Croque Madame, Montecristo, and quiche lorraine are some of my personal favorites when dining in.  Overall, the aesthetic of the bakery is inviting and the aroma and music create a more authentic feel upon entering.  I highly recommend this bakery when you're in the mood for authentic french baked goods.  It's definitely worth the drive.         Though I highly recommend La Belle Terre (LBT) for their baked goods, I am giving a 2 Star rating because of some miscommunication around promotions and usability of a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> Certificate.  During our last visit, my partner and I were making our selections in line when we were approached by an employee inquiring if we were ready to order.  For the most part we were, but wanted to let her know that we had a restaurant $25 certificate to use (minumum purchase of $50).  We typically ordered a meal each, 2 beverages, and 4-6 pastries for the road.  We did not have any issues using the certificate on previous visits.         During this visit, the employee talking to us immediately cut us off and said \"This needs to be in color\" as she held the coupon.  As we previously mentioned, we have used a similar certificate before with no issues, she remarked \"Well I don't know who that person was but I need this in color!\".  This time she had an attitude.  We offered to pull up the coupon on our mobile device to show that it was authentic and she would be able to verify it herself.  She was set on her reasoning that we could have photocopied it and that's why she needed it in color.  (**Note** Photocopies can also be done in color, not just black and white.)  Moreover, despite having a black and white copy, the employee did not attempt to call and verify the certificate number (which was needed to validate it for use in the first place).  At that point, I did not want to continue having a conversation with someone who was not interested in working with paying customers on resolving this issue and decided to dine elsewhere.         I understand this may sound like a lot over a certificate but there has to be updated parameters on issuing these certificates and it has to be clearly written on the certificate if there are any stipulations on their redemption in store.  The app and certificate even said to \"Go Paperless\", so I don't understand what the miscommunication was on verifying the certificate. Overall, I was very disappointed in my experience with La Belle Terre.  I hope that moving forward, there is more service and care around dealing with miscommunication, dealing with service issues, and updating redemption requirements in print and digital communications.  The employee that we spoke to was dismissive and did not attempt to help alleviate the situation or even try and validate our certificate.    I just wanted to leave this review as a word of caution to any future patrons that use <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificates (which can be earned by using Verizon points).  Please read the fine print and call ahead if you need to.  This will save you some time and gas in the future.",

    "text": "When you walk into La Belle Terre, your eyes go straight to the great selection of colourful and fresh pastries at the counter and then promptly to the menus above as you look for a coffee to go with one of the eight that you've narrowed your choice down to! My partner and I came here to give this place a try for some breakfast and we both went for the pressed croissant, my partner adding egg to his which was a great decision! From reviews, I read that service is a little scattered and disorganised and it was quite busy too, so I was expecting a little wait, maybe something missing from our order because we'd personalised it, but no! Everything came in great time, it was hot, fresh and exactly how we asked for it!  They advertise Peets coffee, which I had never tried before but I was very impressed. It was delicious! We didn't go for a large but my partner caught sight of one across the room and said he had to get one next time - it was basically the size of a soup bowl!! We couldn't manage anything else but HAD to try a pastry so we went with a chocolate almond croissant to go, which was recommended by a Yelper and it was delicious!!! Not too sickly sweet or heavy because inside is a marzipan-tasting paste with chocolate as opposed to a heavier cream.  Service was very friendly and we were asked during our meal if all was ok by a friendly girl with a smile. I was impressed by this because table service isn't offered here - this is just a cafe where you grab a number to have your food delivered, so to have a check back wasn't necessary but much appreciated. We will DEFINITELY be coming back here for some great coffee and a sweet treat! The only reason I drop a star is because it is a little on the pricey side, so I do really see it as a treat! Also, now they have the quality of food, drink and service down, maybe they could do a little more to make the cafe itself as aesthetically special as the food, with a European flair. That really would be the icing on top of the cake (or pastry)!",

I almost fell on the floor when I saw the humongous croissant! I have never seen such giant croissant until I came here. Not only that it's huge, it's also one of the best croissant I had.   A genuine French bakery! Unlike other coffee shop who orders their pastries from outside, this place do bake everything in the premise, you can be assured that pastries are fresh everyday.     You don't get those intricate designs on the foam of your cappuccino but nonetheless the taste is perfectly over the top. Not to mention the Goliath cup! It was a great experience and meeting the owner added some personal touch.   I recommend this place and I am definitely coming back!",

You're greeted with an inviting smell of fresh baked goods and not only are they perfectly placed in front of you, you can literally watch them make it in the back. It's a calm environment with classical music serenading you and the decor has a European vibe.   As for the food, I tried the Quiche Florentine and it did not disappoint. It was hot yet crisp and full of flavor. Basically, heaven in my mouth! I'm excited to come back and try some of the other pastries or fresh crepes but they have other options as well. There is also a wide range of sandwiches and salads. And for the coffee fans they everything any other cafe would offer except for frozen drinks. I was excited about the almond milk option. Always a plus!   In conclusion, I've decided that this has to be one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas, and I've tried many!",

It was served on a croissant, and the hollandaise sauce didn't taste like it normally does. It was much more runny as well and there was twice the amount I usually get. This soaked the poor croissant all the day. I would still come here for the great service but I'd probably try something different next time.",

I brought a friend to the coffee shop so we didn't have to go to Starbucks again, he ordered a cappuccino and disliked it so much even ended up throwing it out after a couple of sips. I've tried pastries a few times, one time we could tell they were old and dry (at least they admitted it to be from the previous day and offered a refund).  Suggestion to the new owner and manager: If you're going to charge almost $5 for a croissant or a small dessert at least make sure it's fresh!  Also I feel the cashier lady (maybe she is the new owner?) is unfriendly, even abrasive with the paying costumers. Servers aren't friendly either, not even a smile to greet the costumers, a thank you for coming, nothing at all. It's disappointing!",

They seem a little small at first but they come with a side of delicious potatoes and an optional side salad, making for a perfect sized meal. The top of the quiche was a little darker baked then I would have preferred but it didn't ruin the flavor. Next time I'm craving a French brunch, I'll know exactly where to go!",

Opted for a couple baked treats and a specialty dish. Kouign aman and cannele did not seem all that fresh, and the puff pastry-chicken dish was pretty but completely unseasoned. A sprinkle of salt made a huge improvement, and I'm not one who typically salts my food in the first place. Food was average, wouldn't be my first pick in the area.  Service was okay. They were quite busy, but the staff behind the counter helping with pastries didn't seem familiar with what was out, and were corrected several times to grab the right items by people around me in line. Process could be expedited if staff had clear roles and adequate knowledge of the menu/stock.",

We both were amazed how our pastries tasted so good coupled with amazing textures. The kouign aman was crispy on the outside and chewy inside, while the croissant was very flaky! The coffee also satisfied my mom's taste for a good dark brew.   Only negative point- I did not find their staff friendly.   Highly recommend this place and will visit more frequently :)!",

This Cafe is certainly not French anymore, with Mexicans singing and banging very loudly in the kitchen (which is open and on full view) with many things on their menu not available, they don't even have cookies, quiche or French macaroons anymore, and the quality of their cakes has gone drastically downhill. Anything I order takes soo long to get, and the cafe clearly doesn't have air conditioning anymore, so I have to sit outside where it's cooler, the young filipino waitress is great, but she must get embarrassed serving this food, I just can't eat here anymore. The size of coffee changes depending on who serves you.  I find it very sad that this place has gone this way, as it's in a great spot and I pass it every day. The new manager there doesn't have a clue how to work the cash register, and my god was she grumpy. PLEASE HAVE A NEW OWNER AGAIN VERY SOON.",

    "text": "Update: 5/09/2013. Missed the coffee menu last time so I came back here to try out an espresso drink. After taking a sip of the caramel latte, I came to the conclusion that perhaps I'm not keen on bitter coffee as much as I was in the past. If you like your coffee drinks dark and bitter, then you'll love the coffee here!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this charming place! I would totally come here every day if they serve cafe latte or espresso drinks but that doesn't matter because I will come back here a lot more often from now on. The Italian quiche with a side salad is so delicious and it is half the price as a quiche you may find in a coffee shop nearby whose name I will not name. La Belle Terre Bread also has various scrumptious looking pastries and bread products that I may try later (when I'm no longer fat). If you ask for a salad, make sure to try to LBT vinaigrette, the horseradish that's mixed in this dressing is just absolutely fabulous with the leafy greens!   Oh, they also have savory and sweet crepes. And nice seating areas, both inside and outside. And free wifi!",

I have never had anything like this in my life, it leaves a very bad aftertaste in your mouth, I threw away half of it. It shouldnt be called croissant because its more like a bread with chocolate filling.  Also the canele was burned and bland. Nothing in this cafe makes me want to come back. There are many other french cafes who actually make tasty pastries.",

    "text": "I remember when I was one of the first 7 customers there and getting the lip service from the person behind the counter.  Then I remember coming back later that night and being probably the last customer of the night and silly ol' me, by myself, letting him talk again and getting the same spill about their bakery and how everything is made fresh daily yadda yadda.    But this is what Vegas needs more of, pure and authentic bakeries.    Fast forward to present day La Belle Terre Bread, now with an actual sign on the building indicating French Bakery Cafe rather than a tarp-like sign hanging against the rail.  Had I written this review the first week they opened I would have needed to note this bakery was in the same complex as Paymon's and Sushi-Mon on W. Sahara.  The quiches come in mushroom with ham, mozzarella with basil and tomato, chicken with goat cheese and spinach, salmon with asparagus, and one with all kinds of veggies in it.  I've had them all and they're alright.  The soups I've had was the buffalo bean soup, love it, and the french onion soup, love it.  You get a french baguette with it.  But for $7 I hope it goes down as the weather gets cooler.  I do love the buffalo bean chili soup though.  Another favorite item of mine, when made fresh or that day is the Croque Monsieur (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-belle-terre-bread-las-vegas?select=1PG53Ltrg6dbg_U7OJjgHg#W5VJQeyWQscRG2MoKsWNdQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/la-b...</a>) .  If you do get this, get it with a fried egg on top!!  Additional $1 but well worth it.  There are also pastries to choose from inside the cold display cases to choose from but the bread is where it's at.  I've bought a couple loaves and the only other place I like to get loaves is the German Bakery on Lake Mead and the giant on Charleston, Manon.  The croissant I've had better else where but it's still good and even better with my Nutella packets heheheh but the kougin amann is oh so buttery good.    When on the road, but not necessarily to eat in there, is the chocolate almond croissant!  Have it in a white bag and so while you're eating it on the road some of the almonds and chocolate will fall to the bottom of the bag.  After you're done with the croissant, you can eat the dropped chocolate almonds.  But do come in and try this place out!  And finally, nutella crepes.  Nutella crepes.  NUTELLA CREPES.",

What'd I walk out with? Tiramisu cup, cannelles and the pain au chocolat.    The pain au chocolate was crispy/flaky on the outside and soft inside with the right ratio of chocolate to carbs. Definitely a winner. The tiramisu cup was my favorite. It was sooooo light fluffy, creamy and delicious that I wanted to lick the inside of the cup but I didn't. Now I'm not a big fan of the cannelles but I'm not one for burnt flavor and I just thought it was gonna be soft like custard.   Overall this visit was a win and I believe you get 10% off with your first check in using yelp which I didn't use cause I wanted to go back and use it for some quiche, bread, sandwiches, more tiramisu etc.",

    "text": "This is a necessary review update to eat my words, since I keep eating LBT's amazing sourdough, kouign amann, and...coffee macarons! Earlier, I stated that this wasn't a macaron place, so as not to leave macaron-seekers disappointed (some people leave crappy reviews because they can't get their macaron fix or if they painfully realize that \"soup du jour\" doesn't meant \"soup everyday\", and that's just wrong.)   It started with pink heart-shaped macarons with fresh raspberries for Valentine's Day, and now it seems that assorted flavors of macarons are taking a place in the display case! I selected a coffee flavor (pistachio and raspberry were also available) for $1.20. It was medium-sized with perfectly chewy cookies, delectable coffee buttercream, and an invisible sign stating \"made fresh this morning.\" On a more disappointing note, my beloved cannele had the taste and appearance of yesterday's leftovers. I truly missed the crisp, caramelized exterior.  They've also recently introduce kouign amann, and I would pick this version over Bouchon's, every time. When available, the French Onion soup is vegetarian (no meat stock) and a great choice on a cold day. The shredded Gruyere mixes nicely into the buttery soup base. I never leave without some bread, and I haven't encountered a disappointing loaf so far. If the sourdough baguettes are sold out, I've opted for the 2 lb. sourdough or a Parisien; both are larger and last at least an extra day in my house. LBT's sourdough is the best I've ever tried. It has a remarkable, bubbly crust and an addictive sour flavor.  Crepes are another new addition to the menu, and I will try them soon. Just waiting for that tarte tropizienne!",

I don't drink coffee purely bc my heart feels like it's going to jump out of my chest and can't sleep the same night every time I have a cup of joe, even iced tea makes me jittery. BUT-- I was craving for some caffeine as soon as I walked into the place, so I caved.  Like I said, we just had lunch so we were looking for something to satisfy our sweet tooth. My husband had a regular coffee w/ a vanilla and pistachio macaroon. I had a white chocolate mocha and a vanilla eclair. I sampled the husband's goods and yep, they were good! I am a person whose coffee has ends up being an off white than a dark brown color with all the cream that I put. I would've liked it to be a lot more creamier and not as strong, but hey-- I'm not a coffee person so really, I'll stick to the pastries!  The decor of the interior of the place reminded me of what local bakeries or coffee shops in California where the weather is bearable enough to be outside. Very \"Boudin\" like in San Francisco but like, a tenth of the size.   We'd return... For the pastries.",

I stopped in to check the place out and to get a few dinner rolls.  I got a half dozen mini ciabatta rolls.  We had two of the rolls with dinner this tonight and they're quite good and just what I wanted!  I think I put on an extra pound just ogling the pastries in the case!  I think they were about to call Metro and report me.  Service was very quick and very friendly.  Again, I thank my fellow Yelperazzi for letting me in on this secret.  I didn't know what was behind the big sign I saw going west on Sahara.  Now I'll be parked under that sign numerous times to come.    The place also helps with your mental ability--in fact it has made me a bit clairvoyant.  I foresee me doing lunch here very soon!  C'est si bon!",

La Belle Terre offers artisan breads, pastries, and \"real food\" (quiche, sandwiches, soups) with flair.  On my maiden visit a few days ago, I sampled the \"Normand\" sandwich (turkey breast, Brie, apple, walnuts) and it was very good.  The bread tasted like it came out of the oven a few hours ago: chewy, soft, yeasty, yum.  I also enjoyed the Baby Rasta, an original chocolate meringue cookie sandwich topped with (vanilla) meringue \"dreadlocks\".  Magnifique!  For takeaway, I selected a few macarons (blueberry and passion fruit), chocolate chip cookies, and a cranberry roll.  All were gone far too quickly!  I am returning to try the quiche.  :)  If you haven't already, pay a visit to La Belle Terre.  You'll enter and exit with a smile on your face because how can anyone be sad in a bakery?",

    "text": "Have been here twice in last month. There are about 8 tables inside and 4 tables with umbrellas outside. First visit I ordered to stay-sat inside. There was a couple of ladies working, using the free wifi, talking pretty loudly-collaborating on work. In order to drown them out, I started talking on my phone till my food came. I think between them and I, it may have distracted one lady who went to eat outside.  My first visit ($14), I tried the 3 bean chili, crepe with chicken, spinach and a white cheese (can't remember if it was brie or swiss or something else) - the cheese was more of a sauce then melted in the crepe. Not sure that was preferred-it was a bit too much of the sauce. On my way out, I thought the chocolate chip pecan cookie looked good -- and it was delicious. Besides the cookie, the chili was yummy. The crepe was big (took half home) but, Crepe Expectations on Eastern is better for crepes.  My second visit ($15), I ordered the 3 bean chili, the turkey sandwich with brie (extra .30 for brie vs, any other cheese offered), and 2 chocolate cookies to go. The chili and sandwich were yummy. The cookies looked different than my first visit -- I should have clued in that they would taste different. Oh, they did. I ate the first one, and threw the second one out. They just tasted so different than my first visit. I think that is so weird, why not consistent??  This place is pricey for counter service - the cup of chili is like $3.50+, the sandwich and crepe were in the $7-7.50 range and the cookies ($1.10) were less expensive than the pastries (2.75+) but are small.  The location is great -- pretty central and is good for a quick lunch when out and about.",

My favorite savory crepe here is the Montmartre, favorite sweet crepe fresh strawberries and Nutella.  For sandwiches it depends on my mood, but the Normand, Turkey pressed croissant, and Croque Monssieur are my favorites.  It's nice how you can see them put together your sandwich if you want or chill at one of their tables or outside seating.  For desserts, I recommend the Cannele.  These little sugar wonders are quite tasty.  The macaroons are not bad too.  Great weekend brunch spot or lunch place if you're on this side of town!",

    "text": "the pastry was really good! i expected a larger than life selection base on pictures but really it was a small, quaint, place. Good layout and reminds me of a small parisian cafe.  We got a bunch of fruit tarts, cheesecake,  and creme brulee. The creme brulee was unfortunately burnt on top. I would not recommend ordering creme brulee unless it is freshly made.  The consistency was not good inside as it was thick and rough...probably sitting outside too long.  The burnt top was too bitter, and really the really good ones are burnt when order placed so u can get a crisp warm bite into the cooler interior.  Other than that, the fruit tarts are good, not too sweet custard and the pastry was great.  Being that they gave us a free pastry for my son's bday and it was the only one open on Sunday's around the vincinity, i was so impressed by their customer service.",

My wife had the marmontre crepe and it came out cold, the kids had breakfast sandwiches which we okay at best.  The only reason this place got the second star was because the fruit infused water they give away for free is delicious and the staff is friendly. They remade the croque Madame and it still came out soggy. If you choose to come here after reading this review DO NOT HAVE THE CROQUE MADAME. overall a very disappointing experience.

We didn't wait in line too long, we immediately got our drinks and he got his Apple Danish.

I waited forever for my to go chef salad, and   As I'm sitting out on the \"I'm obviously not sitting at a table because I want my order to go\" couch, of course she brings it out to me on a plate. Do you really think I'm going to eat on this couch with my ordered bottled water?  I requested no cheese specifically, so of course they put cheese in with it...so apparently they have no attention to detail.   Food isn't worth the price $(8.50 for a tiny salad).   I give it 2 stars because the cookie was good and I haven't tried their pastries. Maybe that's what they should stick with - and get smarter staff.   I guess they didn't stop me from coming back last time, but they have finally done it this time. Bravo.",

After two weeks of a protein shake/ Low Carb \"cleanse\" I am allowed a one day \"reprieve.\"  So many option - please, please, please don't screw it up !  Post gym visit, not too far from La Belle and I've been craving the Croque Madame.  Ordered:  Croque Madame ( $9.50) - still a winner !  The amazing sour dough bread, ham, cheese, mustard, egg, etc  - extremely rich and full of flavor - good choice.  Chocolate chip cookie w/pecans($1.05) - a little iffy - decent flavor especially the chocolate, but the texture was off for me.  If someone said it was a day old cookie, I'd believe it.  Carrot Cake ( $4.50) - looked very rich and flavorful and given I could have had a piece of cake at Manon for the same price yet double the size, I had high expectations. It had a spice cake taste to it and I like the cream cheese frosting was lightly sugared but dang it, the cake was dry ... how is that possible ?!  No doubt the Croque will bring me back but the other options are narrowing",

They received a grade of B.  Not A.  They have 14 demerits (i.e. offenses, faults, censures).  3 of those are in \"contamination\"; 3 more are in \"handwashing\".  This was what I wrote in April 2015.  Here is one new complaint I have after visiting them this week.  The pastry shop uses a touchpad as a sales register.  When the customer pays by credit card, as I did, one has to sign with one's own fingers on the touchpad.  Imagine the last customer(s) with a nasty flu virus, an infectious disease like MERS, ebola, or e. coli bacteria.  Many viruses have a life span of at least two weeks.  Let's say La Belle Terre has 50 card-paying customers a day.  That's 700 customers in the last two weeks.  Suppose only 1 out of 100 carried in their fingers one of those viruses/bacteria I mentioned.  Hmmm... that's 7 customers who could be giving you what they have.  Good luck!  Hope your immune system is strong enough to fight that off.   Last time I posted here that the baker (bald, wears dark glasses, 5'5\" height approx) touched his smartphone screen with his fingers and proceeded to touch every raisin roll in the basket, without washing his hands or wearing gloves or using pastry papers  to do so.   Why am I writing this?  Because if you give them rave reviews, you'd expect higher standards from them.",

It was very filling and delicious. The only criticism I had was the crusts were overdone and very hard to cut with the dull knife they gave me. The pastries looked so good that I'll have to go again just to try some of them.",

The canales are my favorite pastry and the civilized coffee is wonderful break from the usual coffee-in-a-disposable cup orders our country has gotten accustomed to. The paninis and crepes are fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and prompt.   They have a lovely patio and the indoor ambiance is very quiant.  It's also a great place to take your mom for lunch or a pastry.  My only criticism (although not worth a lower rating) is that the cold sandwiches are a bit bland so I would suggest the hot options.",

He began to ask if I had cash but I didn't as I had my card in my hand and of course his blame was on me while the whole time I was waiting for my food he was constantly giving me the dirtiest stare and definitely showing his frustration in front of all the guests. When my hot food was ready he grabbed the box and threw it on the counter and stared at me and walked away without saying anything and properly putting it in a bad with utensils and napkins, so I just wanted to get my food and leave, but when I was grabbing the food the lady while busy taking care of another guest still had the courtesy to ask if I needed utensils. I myself work in the restaurant business in a hotel on the strip that deals with a large guest service and with what I encountered with the bald gentlemen was service that should not be allowed to handle with any guests. Not sure how I feel about ever returning, but a little advice from what I see about small businesses is that you don't want to treat your loyal customers or any for that matters if you want to stay strong. Very saddened to have to experience this because the food is always 5 stars, Please have the other blonde French gentlemen who I always see deal with the guests, he is always quick and professional, unless if he sold it and is under new management then that would sucks!",

Man oh man. Both were pure perfection. Not too sweet, not too buttery, not too doughy. The pain au raisin had a custardy feel and the kouign-amann had a perfect light sugar crust. Awesome.",

The pastries were given to me at the counter, and a server brought the coffee and quiche to my table. The pastries were delicious. Not too sweet and perfectly golden. The quiche, on the other side, took about 5 minutes to arrive and did so on the colder side. They have a sign at the register saying how they refrain from using microwaves... I'd rather have a microwave-heated quiche than cold one! However, it was very tasty, so I only took away 1 star. They serve Peet's coffee, which is nice and strong. My total was around $15, which I think was pretty fair. Overall, a very tasty place. I am looking forward to going back and trying more pastries. Also, they keep a case at the register with generous amounts of pastries to taste... Yum!",

I had some questions about the different kinds of French macaroons they carried and tried once again to get the attention of the two guys behind the counter. They were too busy singing along with the radio and continued to ignore me and my attempts to ask questions. After about 5 minutes I got frustrated and left. As I was walking out of the door they both looked up and said \"have a nice day\" and went right back to singing. I am all for having fun at work and I can understand being busy, but this place was slow and I was the only customer in the building. The customer service was terrible and they have lost a customer for life. I would not recommend visiting this place exclusively because of the terrible customer service.",

    "text": "Great pastries, food and staff by history, however recent changes may affect this. I thought for sure I've reviewed the restaurant before, as it's one of my favorites (I think forgot to save) and by history warranted 5 stars. I've been coming here for several years, as does my brother, and friends. We often bring friends or grab items to go for self and others. I've had most of the breads and pastries, Sooo tasty...the best fruit tarts, almond croissants in town. The crepes are light and flavorful. The sandwiches and salads tasty and fresh. I've valued the staff being very friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, organized; dining area tidy and clean even in rush, especially with Pierre present. The past several times I've visited I've noticed a change....some of the staff appears new, not as friendly or knowledgeable and things don't appear as organized (eg, had problems with orders, placing it paying and later finding item was not available; staff not knowing menu, the pleasant engaging personalities not present; sandwich placed on baguette instead of brioche bread), someone I know reported the same, having problems with the standard orders they're used to making and staff not as pleasant (eg quiche usu comes with salad, senior staff relaying just not to include it until the person pushed the issue, staff not as friendly; I see now there is a change in offerings and pricing). I've also noticed Pierre is no longer there; Pierre  created a very positive upbeat and professional atmosphere and appeared to foster it in staff; very engaging with customers and knowledgeable about the menu and food. I'm hoping that the recent changes get ironed out and things return to the atmosphere I've grown to love over time; transitions sometimes take time, new staff often need time to grow and learn. The food and staff by history has been great, however  atmosphere, customer service, as well as great food is important. I'm putting 3 stars for now and will do an update in the future after seeing how things go.",

    "text": "The BF and I couldn't decide what to eat so I looked through my bookmarks and decided we should mark something off this list. It's been a long time I've been meaning to come to this place.   It was busy, seeing as it was right before Christmas, but we decided to eat in.   Croque Madame - it was quality, but it's not our favorite one in town. It all boils down to minute details and preference of liking less dense bread and the bechamel is a little sweet for me. Still, it's one of the better ones in town.   Vol au Vent - puff pastry was crisp and the filling was thick and rich. It was a bit small of a portion though, so it was a good thing I suppose we were sharing this and the larger entree of the croque madame.   Both came with a side salad with a creamy balsamic. Standard, but good and components were fresh.   Kouign Amann I'm glad we got one each. It wasn't hot, which is the best time to get them, but still every bit good with that rich, buttery, flaky sugary comfort I love about it. There really isn't many places that make kouign amann in town unfortunately.   Almond croissant. This was a solid croissant and I enjoyed the almond paste being pure and natural instead of mixed down to a custardy paste or without a strong fake almond flavoring. The MIL loves almond croissants, but can't find one locally she likes so I may have to bring this to her next time for the judging.   The only disappointment was the white mocha latte the BF ordered. The coffee in it was rather harsh, a burnt flavor cutting through it. I don't know if it's a bean variety and it's that jet fuel type flavor profile as this was the first time I've ever had Peets or the machine is not performing up to snuff.   Counter service was alright. They were just trying to get through the line so we didn't get too much personal time in. After that, you take your number and sit yourself with DIY water.   Good overall visit and we most definitely will be back for more pastries. There will probably be much more selection to choose from when it's non holiday season as well.",

    "text": "Coming from Switzerland and having been to France for nearly all my childhood vacations I was craving for some actual actual bread. When I moved to this neighborhood, La Belle Terre was one of the first stops I made. And boy was I impressed! Their food is fresh and always tastes good. I've not had anything bad and I am going there about once every week. But let me write a bit more about what you get  The Food =======  This is a french bakery, although it does serve a bit more than just bread. One can get several different sandwiches, salads and, during the winter time, a soup. Although I would appreciate if they were to offer the soup through the summer too, as I don't see a point in making a difference in Vegas ... They have delicious coffee, which I find increasingly hard to find in the US and great drinks. Nearly always there's a little water dispenser where one can get a small cup of water. If it's not around they'll offer water on request (although I've only had that once).  The Staff =======  The all are very friendly. Sometimes they are a bit slow when there are a lot of costumers, but it's no big deal. I've yet to wait more than 15 minutes on any item I've ordered. They are attentive and have yet to be rude to a customer while I was there. You can ask them for advice and they tell you about their desserts and their menu with a friendly and open attitude. I've come to miss that in Vegas as more than not people here are a tad bit cold.  Conclusion =========  I love this place and would bring anyone here. I'd recommend it to anyone that has a few minutes time to sit down and enjoy one of their sandwiches or pastries. They also do special orders on request which is great for parties and events. One thing that might improve this place would be a few options for sugar free desserts and gluten free bread. But alas, it IS a french bakery, so that request might not be heard :)  Again: Definitely go here if you're around the area and have a few minutes to spare! This place is THE BEST bakery in Vegas!",

This place is about the closest I've found in Vegas and I'm quite pleased with most of the food I have ordered here.  The espresso drinks are made with Peet's Coffee brand product and always delightfully strong.  The savory crepes are outstanding and extremely filling!   Their baguettes and other breads are consistently delicious.  Most of the pastries are also very good, though I did recently have a pain au chocolat that was very dry and seemed a bit stale.  The management has recently changed hands and none of the original workers seem to still be around, probably explaining the dip in both quality of the food and in service.  Hopefully, the new management will learn their way around the menu and cash register sooner than later.  Case in point: I showed my Yelp check-in to receive 20% off the our bill and none of the 3 men who looked at the register could figure out how to enter it....to the point where I was finally just offered a free item on the menu instead.  I wasn't too irritated because this allowed us to try their French onion soup for free.... not that I'd actually recommend it seeing as it lacked in flavor and cheese.  Oh well...",

My other half bought an orange blossom pinwheel while I bought a peanut butter raspberry roll. Flaky, dense, and full of flavor, I hoarded the roll to myself even though it could be a large snack for two. My boyfriend enjoyed his pinwheel as he loves orange and his too was perfectly flaky. We were low on cash as we didn't bring enough with us as we thought we would need so these two pastries proved perfect for a couple desperate for culture and calories. We will surely be coming back.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here on a Sunday afternoon on a recommendation from a friend, as well as a recommendation from a fellow Yelper and we weren't disappointed.  For our starters, my husband had an almond croissant and I had a pain au chocolat, both of which were amazing. They had the right amount of flakiness, firmness and layers that we could taste the pastry, butter, almond and chocolate in each delicious bite. My husband enjoyed a double shot latte with his pastry, while I had a refreshing Perrier.  For our mains, my husband selected the Quiche Lorraine and I chose the Croque Madame, which is a Croque Monsieur with a fried egg on top. I have been in search of the perfect Croque Madame in Vegas since we moved here last October.  We have been to several bistros and patisseries in Vegas, from on the Strip (Bouchon - double digit doughy version) to off strip (Patisserie Manon - non-existent, ran out of bread version). LBTB's version was delicious, however, I agree with a previous reviewer that it could have used more bechamel. Also, while the egg was hot and fresh, the ham and cheese was not very warm. Having said that, the bread was perfect, just the right amount of crunch on the outside and moistness on the inside, the cheese was just sharp enough and perfectly complemented the ham. We asked for a side of dijon mustard, which was a nice accompaniment. My husband had the quiche lorraine, which had a very nice, flaky and tasty crust and the inside was firm and flavorful. Both mains were served with a nice side salad and dressing and arrived together.  The service was friendly and quick, they had ample seating, some seating even had a charging station for laptops and phones. The restrooms were clean and we liked that they quickly cleared the tables after guests left, which we appreciated even though it was fairly quiet since it was early afternoon. There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy a meal surrounded by dirty tables/dishes.  We definitely want to try the Vol au Vent and the Kouign Amann based on the other reviews we read. We even left with a baguette for later.  I wanted to rate 4.5 stars, and would've rated 5 if the Croque Madame had more bechamel and had been warmer. We'll try to come earlier next time and hopefully it will be spot on. Definitely worth more visits!",

    "text": "Items Selected:  Baba Au Rhum Kouign Amann Butter Croissant Almond Tart Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie Palmier Blueberry Cream Twist  When I heard rumor that an independent French Cafe was turning out superlative Kouign Amann  just down the street from my new house I knew a visit was imminent - IE the day we started unpacking - and not only are the stories of stellar French pastry True...they even come from a condescending French baker with uncompromising style and skill.  Admittedly a bit turned off by the \"premade\" croque alongside the fact that almond croissants would not be ready until the ambiguous \"later\" it was a relatively large sampling of the restaurant's wares that we selected on Saturday morning and aside from a slightly doughy blueberry cream twist the results were textbook, inclusive of two of my very favorite items.  Beginning first with a quartet including a warm butter croissant, flaky and natural almond tart entirely devoid of frangipane, and a Kouign Amann still warm liquid at the core it was actually the dense Baba Au Rhum that proved the shocker of the morning with ample booze but gentle sweetness beneath the light cream.  Impressed enough to purchase some items to go it was perhaps the delay in consuming the twist until later that rendered it flaccid and unable to suffer the same fate both the chocolate chip cookie and more so the buttery palmier would prove the best I've found in the Southwest; all the more impetus to call in advance before my next visit to make sure the Almond Croissant is warm and ready.",

All she asked was when the quiches were made as she did not want them cold, all the lady would have had to say is that they heat them up but instead slowly nodded with a disgusting look on her face, my wife does not need that type of condensation... such a shame, because we heard the food was alright. If they are not this utterly rude to you then good luck but if they are nasty to you too then you can literally go one block north to Patisserie Manor where they kindly explain how they heat their quiches and have delicious food without the b****y attitude!",

Croissants, pain de chocolates, quiches, crepes, tartines and of course, coffee. Everything has always been fresh and tasty. The blueberry twist I had last I was there was soft and flakey, PERFECT Sunday breakfast with my wonderful americano. Prices are just and very reasonable for the whole experience.   The cafe itself is charming. A couple couches for those casually catching up and relaxing, dining tables for people having meals, and like any cafe should, tables, chairs and umbrellas outside for those perfect weather kind of days. It's clean, it's casual. What more would you need? They've yet to fail in any department IMO.  Customer service is always on point. Any question you have, they have or find an answer. The positive attitude in service is exemplary. I witnessed a woman who ordered some baked good and ended up sending it back THREE TIMES! Unfortunately I eavesdropped and from the sound of it, she wasn't making herself clear on what she had wanted and on top of it asked for it to be heated up. Each and every time, the employee took it back with a smile on his face and understanding. Even when he went behind the counter, no gripes, rolling eyes or head shaking! THAT is excellent customer service. Mind you the woman didn't say thank you once.",

The employees at the cashier are ALWAYS RUDE and so unwelcoming. Not to say they always messed up my order and double ask what did I order!!! You don't have to ask me- you should have a copy of my receipt! I asked which tea is caffein free and I received an answer \"I don't know, the teas are there, just choose one\"!  The pasties used to look like real French artisan ones and now they are small, old and crappy looking. We even compared it to Jean Phillippe's pastries back in the days. I understand you guys have a new location and probably focus mainly on it but why do you have to neglect your first location so bad. Needless to say I'm never coming back. They are other places who values me as a customer",

I ordered an iced white mocha that was insanely sweet. I love everything on the sweeter side & this was even too much for me.   The cannele's were burnt & this seems to be an ongoing issue here. I would think this should be a really easy fix. So far things aren't great and on top of that the order taker shouldn't be taking anyone's order. Zero personality & definitely didn't want to be there.   Luckily the crepe was really great. Cooked perfectly with crispy edges & soft in the middle with a perfect balance of ham & Gruyere. Loved the crepe!   The displays are very nice & I will say that everything looked amazing. I am very into Parisian anything & I felt like this place lacked in charm , decor & overall atmosphere.   I need to also mention that this place is a 3 min walk from my home so it would be a regular stop minus the iced coffee & burnt pastries.",

Everything was great but the quiche was on the salty side. If you love sweet treats, this is a must try. Don't forget to check in and get 10% off.

A great addition to Las Vegas and to experience a unique French bakery and cafe. I enjoy everything I had especially the spinach and mushroom Quiche and Cheesecake both were on point. They also serve Peet's Coffee which is a plus since there isn't a location in Las Vegas for cafe drinks. Overall a great place to grab a bite and enjoy French delicacy in our very own backyard.

What took me so long to come here!\"  Since Manon (a nearby French bakery) keeps disappointing me, I am so HAPPY that I finally found a cute quaint little French Cafe to stop in and have a pastry and coffee.  I can't wait to try the lunch menu.  I love that it has outdoor seating with umbrellas.  They play French Music so you feel like you're sitting in a French cafe in Paris.  French Press Coffee here, with a FP carafe brought out to your table!  When I ordered my coffee with croissant the menu had the item posted as, \"bread/croissant\" so I asked her, \"Is it just a croissant that comes with the order?\" and she said, \"Yes\". So I get my order and a huge baguette was there too?  Had I known, I would have just ordered a small chocolate croissant...oh well.  She needs a little training and to crack a wee bit of a smile too. I won't knock any stars off for that because the other servers were friendly and I loved everything else about the cafe.    Plus...I got a 10 percent off with my Yelp Check-In.  Despite it's location in a strip mall, it's off on it's own, so you don't have distractions of other businesses or heavy traffic.    The case of goodies isn't as expansive as Manon but they offered Macarons and chocolate croissants as well as other savory treats.  Nice lunch menu too serving up traditional items like grilled Croque Madame, Soups, Quiche, etc.  Great little cafe for a nice breakfast don't miss it.   Bookmark it now!",

Each step through the glass front doors and to stand under the French quarter tin ceiling, I experience wonder, admiration, and surprise.   Today, we brought home a selection of fruit tartlets with pastry cream and puff pastries for a Saturday morning breakfast. I highly recommend the quiches and macarons to fancy.  I have a great appreciation for the bakers and staff at La Belle Terre. After viewing a classic episode of The French Chef by Julia Child, I learned that each buttery, light brioche requires over 7 hours of preparation. As I furthered my interest in the delight of French pastries, I developed a respect for the measuring, mixing, 3 risings, 4 folds, forming, baking, and cooling to exceed 24 hours of time for pastry and creme patissiere recipes. Julia Child's recipes from her book Mastering the Art of French Cooking demonstrate a twist, a loaf, a cake in writing but La Belle Terre brings the delicacies to our palates everyday in the Las Vegas Valley.",

To name a few favorites: everything and the bread.   Croissants are rich and delicious; always fresh. The quiche are very tasty but I only like the vegetarian kind.   Their coffee is actually quite good and much better than the chain brand... Ahem *bucks. The teas are always great although I only buy iced tea because I have the biggest and baddest stash of teas at home but never have the patience to make iced tea.   Sandwiches are HUGE and made with quality ingredients -- like a boss sandwich should be. The selection is limited, however.   The breads are fresh and absolutely amazing. I know some people who will drive 20 minutes to this bakery just to pick up their bread stash.  If you're in the Summerlin area, you gotta stop by and get a hot vanilla latte and a chocolate croissant. That's the stuff dreams are made of.   Sometimes, certain items can be a big miss. But, in all honesty, I've had big disappointments at my favorite 5 star restaurants as well... so.. Hey, it can happen.   I've included photos for review. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I'm trying to debate between 3 or 4 stars, I give 4 stars for their pastry items which are given such time and care, but 3 stars because most of what I had could be comprised of a simple shrug of the shoulders exclaiming, \"it was okay\".  I ordered a small sized cappuccino, the wedding coffee, the bacon quiche and the chapters salad, and will rate them from the order they arrived.  I was a little disappointed with the cappuccino as it was more of a latte with a splash of dry foam on top, I like the espresso they use, as I've been a huge fan of Peet's for a while.  The wedding cookie was probably my favorite thing I got today. It was light and flavorful and just crumbled in your mouth.  The bacon and Gouda quiche came in close second and I just loved the pastry it came on, so light and fluffy! Although I was extremely disappointed that the side salad came with ranch instead of a light vinaigrette, this was one of the first items that really pulled me away from that French feel. The potatoes are good except I included got one piece of bell pepper and one piece of onion which sorta make me chuckle.   The chapters can last... and in last it should stay. I don't have a huge problem with packaged mozzarella, but to say this is a popular item is a long shot, I don't thing Roma tomatoes is a good pairing with mozzarella and their balsamic glaze is nothing but balsamic vinegar, or else they should really work on it. It also came with a side of mixed greens that were not dressed and the whole plate could have used some olive oil, Malden salt and fresh cracked pepper.   I also wish their decor was as light and uplifting as their music. They were starting off great with the pastry case and just need to bring that vibe throughout their whole establishment. And my god, it's 2018... stop using styrofoam! It's bad, for anything, using in the microwave, breaking down for waste...  Definitely come here if you are looking for some pastries or some nice baked goods, but their house specials are lacking in the same French flare as their pastries.   Happy Eating!",

The tuna was nothing like the master piece they once served. Prepared unlike the previous. Basic no pazazz..boring. and get this they used a sliced bread on the bottom and a french baguette on top lol like i was getting the leftovers..are you fing kidding me? Lol salad was wilted dressing was poured out of a giant tub of what appeared to be something you would buy at smart and final. The pastry selection is poor compared to before. Not really friendly service but neither was the last guy. I guess its a french thing haha..too bad...pass..not recommended anymore...clean up your act or become a dinosaur.  Follow up...few minutes after i posted this follow up look at this disgusting,arrogant and rude response from this representative.  Its clear from the the response that you need to re-evaluate your attitude and the quality of your food. I dont need to take pictures of what i write my reputation for writing intelligent honest and frank reviews speaks for itself. As for your response..well it speaks for itself. I will never return and make sure my friends know how you acted and the garbage you are now serving.",

So we ordered the bacon quiche and it should be called the tomato and cheese quiche. It was filled with soggy mushed tomatoes and topped with tons of cheese and a little bit of bacon.

The ambiance is pretty laid back and you can enjoy a cup of cappuccino with a friend and don't be bothered to stuffed yourself with so much carbs.  The breads and pastries sizing is out of this world. You go to a casino and they charged you double the price and less than the amount and yet you still get the same or even better quality and freshness. They also served breakfast sandwiches and savory crepes and some lunch menu as well.   Note: if you are attending Diner En Blanc this coming April, this can be a great place to order your to go food for the picnic!",

For $9 it was basically one big piece of ham cut in half, a sliver of cheese. The fried egg was burnt on the bottom. So disappointed!! The almond croissant has a weird after taste almost as if it's been pre-packaged. Is this why it was dead?? Spent $17 When I could have just made breakfast at home. I would post photos but some reason Yelp is taking forever to load. Won't be back.",

The bread on the French toast past was fluffy but I felt like it was too bready but overall it didn't taste that bad. I ordered it to go and it didn't come with the cranberry sauce on the side so that kind of sucked. The Napoleon I ate while waiting for my food. That I give a 5/5. The custard tasted great and it also had strawberries in it, which was amazing. I expected the puff pastry part to be a little more flaky but it tasted a little soft. But overall the food I gave 4/5. While walking out I saw the almond croissant. Maybe I'll come back to try one of those",

I haven't explored the savory, but the sweet is on par. Just by visual, the savory options are authentic and quality. The sweet tarts here are very tasty. I enjoyed  almondine, pear, and raspberry tarts while also being awarded with a cannelle and macaroon. The lack of one extra star is for service. They definitely need to up their attention to customer service and how they approach. Their is a lack but its simply finesse-related. This will not deter me from revisiting them many times to try everything they offer!",

The pastry is not too sweet, perfect sweetness for me and an excellent flavor of the butter. Also the French bread has nicely crispy outside and moist and elastic inside. I usually mist it with water and warm it up in the oven at home before eat it though when I have the bread at home. That's the best way to have delicious hard bread. I think the place is an authentic French bakery style cafe, I've never visited to France though. Definitely try them!!",

    "text": "Rating HIGHLY impacted by service-not the food as it was good. Must have had my invisible clothes on this morning when I arrived here for Sunday breakfast with my Dad. We make it a habit every weekend to try 1 new place to eat (steered by our trusty Yelp app). Stepped up to the counter and cheerfully greeted the stoic cashier gentleman with glasses with a \"Good Morning! It's our first time here\" as I showed him my Yelp check in from my phone. He seemed unaffected and zombie like looking at me like-just order and move-on. I gave my order (Paris crepes, breakfast sandwich and 2 medium Peet's coffees $15)-I mentioned that we'd like both coffees with creme and one with sugar. He peered over the rim of his glasses and glared, outstretched his arm and gave the point to a   station across w/milk, sugar etc.  I said oh thanks ! We were given a number card and left to seat ourselves. We waited and waited watching the people who were in front of us be served, a gentleman who came in after us and still no coffee. I thought to myself, shouldn't we have coffee? And why would we have it delivered only to have to get up and leave our food to go cold while we prepped our coffee? I saw people getting their coffee immediately after ordering and thought to go ask if our coffees were on the way. The same annoyed man (no one was inline) looked up and essentially turned his back as I was asking about the coffee-thankfully a nice young man acknowledged me, apologized and gave me 2 coffees. Back I went to the seat...where I waited and waited and again went to the counter to inquire about our order as we watched 3 more tables get served. Well, it seems Mr. Personality didn't even put our ticket up to be made-and it's not like he had to go far our stretch too much-he had to simply turn around. Again the individuals who made an attempt to resolve and apologize for the situation had nothing to do with the situation and more than likely in guessing the one who did-are the owners. His wife in the kitchen who tells me-it only takes a couple of minutes to make the crepe and sandwich-ok great, then why has mine taken 30 minutes? The two busboys were kind enough to bring a basket of assorted goods to apologize (again, not their fault).  Great effort on their part-major fail on the owners. Will I go back?...tbd...I go to Manon and chocolate & spice-and there are more out there yet to try. Sad because the crepes were good, bread delicious and the cookies we were given delishhhh-unfortunately I tend to frequent places that greet me with the same smile I give them.",

    "text": "I popped by La Belle Terre (\"The Beautiful Land,\" en francais, but you knew that) with no expectations other than I wanted some bread.  \"Wow, it's big,\" I thought as I parked the car, checked in on my phone, noted the Yelp check-in deal, and cast a dour look across the parking lot at a certain popular bakery that hadn't impressed me in the past. \"Good omen or bad omen?\", I wondered.  The interior of LBT is just gorgeous. A display case that runs almost the length of the store, surrounded by gleaming wood everywhere, and an open kitchen behind it all where you can watch the baked goods being prepared. Ooo.  I was immediately dismayed to see that they were out of the dark chocolate bread with walnut, but missing out on popular items is always the risk that comes with visiting a bakery in the afternoon. Foolish me!  I settled for a regular baguette, a loaf of garlic and sundried tomato, two tarts (lemon and chocolate/raspberry mousse), and - oh my - a mini quiche ratatouille. (Do you know how difficult it can be to find a vegetarian quiche that isn't \"cheese 'n broccoli\"?)  One of the men working there offered to heat the quiche up, but alas I wasn't staying. I spoke to both guys for awhile and was really impressed with their passion for their products. Everything certainly looked good, and portions were generous.  At home later, the two tarts didn't last long. Light and flavourful, both of them. The quiche went on standby for a couple of days but was still very nice after a trip to the microwave. (A little soggy, but I'm sure that was my fault for waiting.)  Not too eggy, not too heavy, and not so overladen with vegetables that the cheese didn't get noticed.  Both loaves of bread went into the fridge right away, wrapped. The next morning I reached for the baguette and was shocked to find a long rock instead. Grumbling, I put it back and didn't touch it again until the next day, when I sprinkled it with a little water and put it in the microwave. That resuscitated it (for small amounts, eaten a bit quickly), and I could tell it would've been quite delicious if I'd had it the same day.  The garlic/sundried tomato loaf was a six-dollar mishap for me, though. I took it out of the fridge a few hours after coming home and pulled off a little piece to taste it. \"Jeez, that's dense!\" The garlic and tomato certainly smelled nice, but I really didn't care for the bread itself; it seemed so tasteless. That might be just my prejudice against bread with a tight crumb and soft crust, but to me this tasted like a black hole and a slice of Wonder Bread had a baby then sprayed it with garlic perfume.   But again, judging by everything else, it's clear that La Belle Terre knows what it's doing, so don't let my one thumbs-down moment scare you away. With such a spacious, lovely interior, airy sweets, and a staff genuinely excited about what they're doing, overall I give LBT a very solid thumbs up.",

Again, SWEETNESS IS MY WEAKNESS. but for La Belle Terre \" no microwaves were harmed.......\" LOL  I've always had a thing for bakeries, I love pastries! Cheese Danish - Oh man, GET THIS! So good! Surprised that it's inexpensive too, so fresh and the cheese is just perfect as well as the bread itself.  Banana Crepe - I am not going to lie, I didn't enjoy it as much, I mean it's good but not to the point where you would want to get it again, few cuts of banana and some chocolate syrup that's all it is, I mean they could've put more bananas but I will try different crepes next time and update my review,.  Hot Cocoa - Ha! Not too sweet and not too plain . Perfect mix!   SERVICE i am guessing because they're busy they tend to do everything fast paced, I just didn't like how they brought the food out, they just slap it on the table, and the utensils are \"to be followed\".    But I am still giving them 5 stars because I enjoyed the food and everything is fresh!",

    "text": "This cafe is just awful. I ordered a quiche. I cut into it and a super-salty cream poured out. No eggs, just disgusting cream. It looked almost normal at first glance, a cheese covered it like a crust. Nothing on my plate was good, actually, not even the salad dressing. I tried an eclair. Shouldn't that be a custard filling inside a tender pastry? Well, it was a tough and nearly burnt pastry with some kind of low-grade whipped cream inside. It was, like my meal, totally disgusting. Looking in the case, I saw a sign for what they claimed to be a cinnamon roll. It was something lumpy and misshapen under a solid mass of taupe frosting. No, thanks. The bathroom was another disgusting moment. I walked out of it knowing that there was no way I could approach the toilet without getting bodily waste products on some part of me. As for the service? There was a young, zombie-like woman who refused to make eye contact and who only sprang to life when expressing impatience about having to walk over to the pastry case. I would never recommend this place. It may have been good once, but those days are over.",

The staff is so friendly here, and I observed that they knew the regulars by their name. That's the kind of places Chad and I love, and it feels like home as visitors to be treated the same way.

    "text": "I come here strictly to enjoy their delicious Peet's coffee and I would be coming here more often, but theres a very important detail that La Bella Terra is missing lately.  This important detail is customer service from the cashier who happens to be the manager. I'm not sure if it's too much to ask for the person working behind the register to greet customers when they put their order in.   To me this very small but important detail can either make or break your business. And I'm not mentioning it because of one incident. I'm mentioning it, because it's been going on now for a few months.  I personally enjoy taking my money to a place where the staff is happy to serve their customers, especially their regulars. Even though I'm not very pleased with the service from management, I will point out that the 1 barista that I see regularly is a sweetheart.  He is always smiling and seems to take pride in his work and enjoys serving people.  Overall I'm not sure how many more times I'll be coming back here. I guess it all depends if things improve concerning the customer service. Other than that I would recommend this place for a great cup of coffee and unique tasty treats. I've tried several items on their menu and don't have any complaints about their food.  My hope is that this one area of discrepancy will be addressed and things will change for the betterment of this establishment.",

It's just that 1) not offering a ceramic cup for coffee, 2) service staying behind the counter with one register no matter how long the line is, and 3) paper plates served -- service is not #1 priority either.  I sat for 90 mins, and wasn't asked if I needed anything.  The main room of La Belle Terre has the \"factory\" and 5 tables and sofa, then a small side room has another 6 or 7.  This place does the business, so finding a seat is at a premium.  That said, the coffee (Peet's, not exotic) is good (large, $2.25), and the quiche and bread was wonderful ($5).  Nothing wrong with the quality or quantity.  Sign me up, but I would rather go to Sambalatte Torrefazione any day.",

My only vague, relatively unimportant complaint is for all their salads they make a unique balsamic dressing, almost like a balsamic cream. I'd love it if I liked balsamic (but I hate it) and I wish they had other dressing options. But that still doesn't stop me from ordering salads - THAT is how good this place is :) :)",

But it is open 7am-7pm daily. You can sit outside, order some coffee, and get a nice meal for $10ish.

    "text": "My first time. Horrible experience. There were 2 large parties one after the other who were scheduled. Each group had about a dozen people. The noise level deafening. With only one entrance at the far end,  everyone trying to enjoy a meal, conversation or read was unable due to the 2 groups trying to squeeze by each other as they were leaving or arriving. I was asked to leave a table. Then was bumped, as I sat in my 2nd chair,  several times since there was not enough room for customers or staff.  Ambience is a big zero.   I was brought the wrong coffee. I got up (lost 2nd table) and waited for a while at the register to explain about the coffee. The wait was ling because the staff was rearranging the tables to accommodate group #2 who was loudly waiting amongst all the seated customers. Finally I got the correct coffee, but had no where to sit. I stood while waiting for the quiche I ordered. Finally, a table was empty. I grabbed it, bussed it, and waited another 5 minutes or more at the dirty table until after asking again, I got the meal in a to-go container. The box had been sitting so long, the salad inside the box had wilted from heat.   The 'manager/owner' (?)  apologized on one of her passages as I was standing waiting at the register. \"It's usually not so hectic, but we have  2 large groups here this morning.\"  I suggested in such a busy and small place they might need to rethink reservations for groups. She snapped back, \"Why would we do that, they paid ahead of time!\"    So had I. Every customer pays  at the register prior to sitting down to wait for their order. Had I not paid ahead of time, I would have left without eating. Coffee #2 was made correctly, but it was a small which they served in a large size paper cup, so it was half empty. That was weird, too.   Noisy. Cluttered. Attitude. I drove 35 minutes to get there. Never again.",

I ordered the turkey with brie panini; not much flavor and the crust was like cardboard. Turkey was of the pre packaged, processed type, not the fresh shaved deli variety, which is what I would expect if you're charging $10 for a panini. I thought the cranberry sauce would be in the panini for a great mix of flavor, but it was on the side and obviously from a can. It came with a salad, which was wilted, and roasted potatoes that were severely lacking in aroma and flavor.   I also ordered a chocolate croissant that was disappointing as well. It was rather hard and the chocolate wasn't even melted.   Wasn't worth it for me considering the price of my meal ($16.00) and the lack of quality and flavor.",

I live in Henderson, my friend drove from the airport to this place to get me my Danish which is usually beyond delicious. He's a he lol and didnt notice how dark it was. As soon as I opened it I knew and I heated it up to soften it. It was very crunchy and most of it went in the trash. Very disappointed that they would over cook it and then serve it.

Counter service was friendly and the food was delivered to our table after a short time   The cup of French Onion Soup was loaded with onions and lots of cheese on top. The broth was light. I would have preferred a more full flavored stock. This was the first time I  had French Onion Soup with bay leaves. Removing  them before serving would have been my preference. The Turkey Panini sandwich comes with roasted potatoes, a garden salad and cranberry sauce in a cup.  I enjoyed the sandwich with the crusty bread but would liked to have more turkey. Adding the potatoes which were crispy outside and tender inside along with the salad made a complete meal.  One of the staff members followed up twice to check on our needs and satisfaction. Also they promptly removed the empty plates.",

Today was pastries only! They have beautiful selections, very appealing to the eye. Glazed, flaky and fruits are plump and plenty. The average size is 4-5 inches wide, centers filled with creamy goodness.   We made our choices, one pistachio cream with white chocolate chips, one cherry and cheese and one mixed fruit! All three where very good, butter, flaky crust, tasty cream fillings and fruits. Agreed we had the best ones.   Curious about their other menu items and that temps me to think about coming back to try something other then pastries! Service good, place smells wonderful, clean and there is some beautiful breads and pastries for sure!",

The omelette was great and was just the right amount of food. Not too big you have leftovers and not too small that you're still hungry.   For coffee, I ordered a large Caramel Macchiato. It was a good choice and I would recommend it to others.   Overall this place is amazing and there only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because the omelette come with three items and ever item added after that is posted at $0.75 but I was charged $1.75 and $1.50 for the avocado. Not a big deal but still.   I did greatly enjoy this place and I will be back to try more of their menu.",

I found Pierre ( how appropriate his name) the manager to be a grumpy and unpleasant person. When I asked him if his quiches were prepared fresh daily, he appeared to be insulted and became slightly hostile. Wow. It was just a question Pierre. Relax. I ask this of every bakery I visit all around the world. Then I asked him to make me something off the menu and honestly, I've had better breakfasts at McDonalds. The restaurant was full of flies and my friend got a sun burn as their shades in the windows are horrible. I definitely will not be back not would I recommend this establishment. With the hundreds of brilliant and friendly restaurants in the LV valley, why endure this experience when you could be dining in a much more pleasant environment with friendly service, delicious nosh, sans the giant flies and sunburns. :)",

We each had a pastry and a hot item, the quiche and croque-monsiure were excellent.  While eating outside the owners walked up and asked how our meal was.  There were several expats eating there, can't be too far off authentic.  We will return again. Thanks.",

I'm not a fan of the cannele's everyone loves, but that's just me. Now if they only served Peet's full service! I really miss Peet's ice blended drinks! I love that I can sit outside as well.

    "text": "Pros: The food is alright. Cons: Poor customer service, slow, ran out of soup du jour and pesto sauce by 1pm.  My story:  My first time to Le Belle Terre, I decided on some baked goods to go and the soup du jour and quiche to eat there. When it was my turn to order I picked out my baked goods and I was about to order my meal, when a man walked up and started talking directly to the cashier that was taking my order. The man told the cashier he'd like to order the soup du jour. The cashier diverted his attention from me to the man (with out an \"excuse me\" or the like), took the man's order, and charged the man. When the cashier reverted his attention back to me, (without even acknowledging what had just happened) I said I would like to order the soup. He said that he was sorry but the last of the soup had just been ordered. I asked him if it had been ordered by the man that had rudely interrupted my order and he answered \"I guess so\".  Appalled, I decided to go with the rustic sandwich and no quiche. As I awaited my order, the same cashier approached me and said they were all out of the pesto sauce that came on the rustic sandwich. The sauces available for substitute were mayo and dijon. Seeing as I dislike both, I took him up on his offer to substitute the sauce with spinach. My order was served sans spinach.   Small gripes:  They serve water in dainty little plastic cups, which is fine, but there is no place to self-serve water. With no wait service and potential busyness, the prospect of more water becomes more of a problem than anything.  Lastly, their entrance is a set of double doors. The left door is locked yet there is no mention of it anywhere. A \"Please use other door\" would better serve customers trying to enter.",

Me and my wife went there for brunch on a saturday for the first time and had the french onion soup which was really good also had a couple of quiche's which were awesome.   The following weekend we went there again brunch on Saturday ordered the onion soup which I was told it was not made,understandable that happens once in a while.Then my wife odered the fig bread again they didnt make it that day ended up having the chili which was really good and bought the garlic/onion bread which was great. Also had the quiche which was awesome.  So Monday rolls around and I'm in the mood for the chili I had the other day so for luch I head there.I get to the counter and order the chili then the cashier tells me they didnt make chili today I get so pissed I leave without getting anything.  On to Wednesday I was in the mood for their chili once more. This time I call to see if they have it and long and behold no chili today! Good thing I didnt waste my time again going there!  Why not make these great things on a daily basis!  Their menu is limited as it is.  This place has the pontetial to be great unfortunatley they have to get their stuff straight. Will not be going there for a while tired of getting dissapointed!",

    "text": "I've been searching for my perfect French macaron locally so this review is for the macarons only. They were quite fabulous, great texture, light, crisp, thin shell, chewy center, right amount of filling. What put these at a 5 for me over Bouchon was the filling. It wasn't the overly sweet buttercream type filling. The fruit macarons had the perfect tart filling. This time they had 4 flavors, chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and black currant. All were delicious, my favorite was the raspberry. I'd love to come back and see what other flavors they may offer. I'd highly recommend these over the highly (yelp) rated Patisserie Manon macarons. As of now, this is my go to for macarons. The cafe had many delicious looking bakery items that we will try next time.",

On the menu, they had this same crepe, except it came with a fried egg on top.  I knew I was going to order this dish the second I read it on the menu, but I didn't want to at the same time.  I fear change.  Do I deviate from the norm and order this fancy dish?  Or do I stick with what I know that always satisfies and never lets me down.  Damn you fried egg.  Damn you for challenging me.  But I thank you as well fried egg, because I did order you on top of that crepe.  And you did add even more depth not just into that crepe, but into my life.  Thank you.  What a great place, I will be back.  I would definitely wanna get a quiche knowing the crepes are that good.",

We both had the Paris crepe (recommended by the woman assisting us). I subbed out the ham and added spinach (no meat for me!) and my husband had the original. Swiss cheese, ham and a beautifully done fried egg. So delicious! He tried both and said the ham \"added something\" - not surprising as this was the original recipe - but I didn't feel like I was missing anything.  He had the strawberry crepe for dessert (served with whipped cream and chocolate) and I had the delicious khouign amonn (sp?). Both were perfect.   This is definitely a 5 star bakery/cafe and we will be back!",

Couldn't hear the cashier at all, he was super quiet and shy, may have been new. They do have free WiFi and charging outlets. The atmosphere was nice and clean and they have cute patio seating.  Hubby got a breakfast sandwich that looked pretty good, albeit small. But I was sorely disappointed that there were no macarons. I originally wanted to go to Sugar Belle's bakery, but they are closed on Mondays.   Pretty disappointing way to end the trip to Vegas. :( what kind of \"french bakery\" just doesn't have macarons?

I chose the Caprese Salad, and then decided to pick up a few macarons for a friend's birthday the next day. It was somewhat pricey. The macarons are 2$ a piece, and there is no pro-rate price for buying a dozen. (That's ok. They were very good.) The Caprese Salad was 9.50$, and when I got home to eat my lunch, I discovered that it didn't include any of the pesto or balsamic that was stated on the menu. That was a huge bummer. I'm a fan of a decent Caprese, and for what I paid, I could have made it myself. The buffalo mozzarella and basic tomatoes were served on shredded ice burg lettuce. There were only small shreds of basil, that was starting to wilt. I had no problem with the service and my macarons were perfect. I will go back again to try a quiche and perhaps the Croque Madame before I form my final opinion.",

    "text": "Placed an order for delivery and it took an hour and a half.  30 minutes past the delivery time quoted.  That's not a big deal as I assumed they were just busy.  What turned me off was the response when I called the restaurant for a status update.  At first the guy who answered said he only had one order this morning and it wasn't mine.  When he checked again, it was indeed mine.  Then I asked had the order gone out and he said he didn't know, he just knows there isn't any order there waiting to go out.  So to clarify I asked again, did that mean it was en route, and he said again, all he knows is there isn't any order there in a more insistent tone.  The tone and the way he responded was not a pleasant interaction.  I asked if he had a delivery driver and are they in the restaurant right now?  Same response...your order isn't here.  Very dismissive and unhelpful.  With as many options as there are here in Las Vegas, I won't waste my time with them again.  As a hospitality management professional, I can say with confidence that food is only one component of operating a F&B business.  I'm sure the food is great from what I can see from the Yelp reviews.  However, the overall experience is what leaves the impression and it starts and ends with customer interaction.  I'm giving them 3 stars because I'm just going to assume they were busy and the guy was flustered.  Otherwise, it'd have been lower.  Food was cold by the time it got to me an hour and 45 minutes later.",

La Belle was close by so we decided to give it a go. Smaller location than Patisserie Manon and not as much selection which was disappointing. Food was good, we shared a Croque Madam and a cheese danish. $8.50 for the sandwich with a side salad/garnish. It was good but nothing exceptional. I enjoyed the cheese danish, light flaky crust and decent size. I didn't look at the price but it was probably around $3.00 or so. I did notice that this place had a lot more bread than there competitor a few blocks away, however, a loaf of sourdough was $7 - eek, a bit pricey for a loaf of bread. The bread in the sandwich was quite tasty. Ultimately, I am glad I tried it but I am going to remain loyal to Patesserie Manon.",

It was really nice, the perfect light brunch. My boyfriend got two gorgeous little tarts and he loved them both. I tried his lemon one and it was almost a cheesecake taste - SO good! They also have free water with fruit slices in it, which is perfect with foods like these. We have gotten two of their fresh breads - a farmhouse style and then a sourdough. The sourdough was my favorite. Delicious. They also have a nice little patio to eat outside and have a cafe style inside with free wifi. I highly recommend this place!",

I went to pick up the cake yesterday for his party and they ended up making the cake look like it is for my daughters birthday party with pink and purple flowers. I explained that it is for my husband and when I ordered it they knew what colors to use. I took it home to see if it can be fixed with the fake flowers taken off, but because the colors on the cake were to feminine. I called to take it back and they offered me a full refund with the cake given back. I went today to return the cake to the bakery. The owner was so rude, mean and unprofessional when I explained what happened yesterday. I was told I couldn't return it, because they were not able to resell it back to their customers. I was told the cake touched my shirt leaving the frosting on my clothes and it wasn't on purpose to not resell items that were taken out their store to someones home left in the fridge overnight. As a bakery not following the health code in any state in this country, I believe that we are not allowed to resell items to customers after it leaves their stores. I wouldn't recommend this bakery to anyone in Vegas living here or visiting here to waste your money on people who are not professional and say that you and anyone in your family are not allowed to buy items in their bakery. I was very nice to write a truthful review and they don't deserve the one star either. I will not call the Las Vegas Health Department to inspect their business and possibly shut them down. I would advise as a customer who has their husbands birthday ruined didn't deserve to be treated this way.",

They were bustling but there were enough tables for us to find a nice booth window seat.   We ordered the croque madame and croque monsieur. They came out hot, fresh and looked great. The bread was toasted to perfection and so fresh! Super crisp but fluffy at the same time. You can really taste the fresh baked bread difference and it's incredible. Also, both dishes came with a small side of mix salad with a creamy balsamic dressing.   The flavor profile for both dishes were for the most part, the same, with tiny differences. The croque madame came with a beautiful fried egg on top of a melty ham and cheese sandwich with bechamel sauce. On the other hand, the croque monsieur was like a grilled bubbling ham and cheese sandwich. Both tasted great, but my favorite was the croque Madame as it was juicier and more moist from the creamy bechamel and the runny egg.   My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how much he enjoyed his croque Monsieur and he said he preferred his over mine. He is a big fan of this place. We are excited to try their crepes and their quiches next time!",

I love the fresh bread, the gooey cheese, the perfectly cooked egg that goes on top, its perfect! The ONLY problem that I have is that it fills me up and I don't have enough room for the equally delicious (in a completely different way) chocolate almond croissant. This charming little bakery has lots of goodies, including breads, soups, pastries, and macarons. My favorites however, are Croque Madame and Chocolate Almond Cruissants. Hands down.",

I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but when I'm craving sweets, these are exactly what I'm looking for. Not overly sweet and really tasty.

The croque monsieur/madame comes with salad and an excellent dijon mustard dressing that is NOT sweet! :)  I had a croissant at Starbucks the other day that was so dry I had to choke it down with half a bottle of water. I was so mad, that I decided to just not have another one unless it was from an authentic French bakery.

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place (I prefer to patronize local restaurants), the coffee and apple turnover started things off right. The coffee is good and strong and the turnover had a fresh buttery flakey crust with a not too sweet not to tart apple filling (texture of apple sauce with the thickness of apple pie filling...very nice). La Petite Bakery in Colorado Springs, French Bakery in Fort Walton Beach, and the quiche at Adam's Mountain cafe in Manitou Springs were my benchmarks.   Unfortunately, La Belle wasn't on par with my past experiences in similar restaurants. The chicken and goat cheese quiche dough was raw and the chicken gave it that re-heated chicken taste. I asked for something else, which they were really nice about. I got the breakfast sandwich (egg, ham, and swiss on a ciabata roll) and it was ok. The ham looks like your average luncheon meat, but the bread was nice. Honestly, though, I think I have had better breakfast sandwiches and even quiche at Panera.  The side salad that came with these items had a good vinaigrette, but could use more field greens and less iceberg (personal preference).  I will say the price point is good and I would think about grabbing a baguette for dinner another time because they look great. Also, the owner was very helpful and nice as I was ordering. Overall...ok, I might give them another try because maybe it was an off day and all the other reviews are so strong, but with so many places to try in Vegas; I imagine it won't be soon.",

The sourdough bread is delicious and flavored well, and the medley of ingredients soaked in egg yolk after you break the egg on top is just heavenly in your mouth. The crust was a tad hard though and made it challenging to cut and eat with a knife and fork, but it's definitely too messy to be a hands-on sandwich.  The nutella crepe was good but not the best I've had. The nutella is squirted into the crepe instead of smeared, so there are areas of the crepe missing nutella if the nutella trail didn't venture there.  I also had the watermelon & kiwi juice. The kiwi portion was separated and settled on the bottom when the drink arrived and it was the first thing I got on my first sip. It was incredibly tart and overpowering. After mixing up the drink and diluting it with water (it was really strong in flavor), it tasted much better.  The bf had the rustic sandwich and described it as just OK.  4 stars because the croque madame is excellent, but I can't say the same for some of the other menu items. I will still have to go back and try the bread and pastries though.",

The pastries are fantastic with a wide assortment and the food is no different. From crepes, quiches, or simply some fresh French bread with some marmalade to spread on it, this lovely little bakery does not disappoint. The quiches are never microwaved, always heated to the perfect temperature. The crepes are fluffy and whether you choose a savory one or sweet one, you'll still be thinking about it days later. Another plus about this particular bakery is that they are so far the only bakery in town that brews Peet's coffee. Great food, awesome coffee, and a friendly staff, what more could you want from a bakery? Do yourself a favor and try this place out!",

When I saw the Napoleon in the case it was not what I expected. Like the one in Georgia and the one pictured here at Yelp, it didn't have the white with chocolate accented frosting on top. It was more of a glaze but I didn't let that stop me. I bought a Napoleon and ONE Macaron....big mistake.   I had my Napoleon after dinner and I didn't enjoy it. The puff pastry tasted and looked over cooked, also I wasn't wild about the cream. My Napoleon from Georgia is still number 1. But my coffee flavored Macaron....was magnificent!!! Can't believe I only bought one!! Next time though.",

Five minutes later we were served the soup?  The bechamel sauce was more like colored water. The crepe was burned.  We all said we would never go there again.

Everything just looked so good I couldn't stop myself from pointing to one pastry after another asking it be added to my order!   I'm not exaggerating when I say everything was delicious. I got a couple of cannele and, having never had one before, wasn't sure what to expect. Holy cow, they were SO GOOD. My kids didn't care for them (think the caramelized bottoms are a turn off to younger kids but that just meant more for me) so I think these are for an older crowd. The inside was eggy and lemony and the outside was crunchy, chewy and perfectly caramelized. The kiddos loved the Nutella pastry, as did I. The chocolate twist was also a big hit. The danishes were delicious. I especially liked the cherry one. The chocolate croissants were perfect as were the plain croissants. Delicate and flaky and buttery.   I'll be back next weekend to try some of the pastries I didn't get to this first time around!  (I noticed a few reviews saying the 10% off with check in wasn't honored but I had no problem getting the discount.)",

The quiches are premade sitting in the fridge and they heat it up. The goat cheese in it was so overpowering and not good at all. Chicken was also a little rubbery. Rosalies are much better. Service is really good though. The cashier was incredibly friendly. I think he is the owner, and he gave us free bread. They didnt have much to offer when I went at 4pm. Hope to give another chance during the morning when they have more pastries.",

Please open one closer to McCarran (don't really because I would eat there everyday)!!  Food: Almond croissant and plain croissant for sharing. The almond croissant was flaky, light and had almond flavoring throughout the entire croissant. One of the best we have had! The plain croissant had a light buttery flavor and was so airy and delicious I didn't want it to end.  Poulet quiche and side salad and the breakfast sandwich also with the side salad. The quiche had great flavor and the hint of goats cheese was a nice touch. The crust was perfect and flaky and the quiche was light so you didn't feel weighed down. Husband enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and the bread was so fresh it was hard not to go back for more.   The coffee was fine and had a unique taste (maybe their in home water purification). Be sure to glance one more time at the goodies in the window and fresh breads behind the counter before leaving as you may want to continue to enjoy the LBT experience at home. We WILL be back to visit.",

Location may be a little \"hidden\" as it is adjacent to Sahara but it is adjacent to Paymon's. If you see Paymon's, you have arrived. LOL   First thing i notice when i enter? A variety of various fresh baked breads and goods all laid out behind the glass for your eyes to drool over... and stomach to rumble to... ;_; Second thing noticed??? PEET'S COFFEE ! O.O ! Hello. Those from the bay would recognize it easily. I'm not from the bay but a pretty frequent visitor and i love their coffee ! I tend to opt for Peet's over Starbucks if i'm in the bay =X that's pretty good right? XD   1st time, i had the Croque Madame, Peet's Coffee. For those who do not know, a Croque Madame is a classic ham and cheese sandwich with a bechamele (spell check) sauce and a fried egg on top. sounds amazing no? their variation is pretty good. If anything, i think i prefer it over the one from Payard's Patisserie and Bistro inside the Caesar's Palace !    2nd time, i got the Rustic Sandwich, Peet's Coffee, and Strawberry & Nutella Crepe. Rustic sandwich is a simple sandwich in a baguette with thinly sliced prosciutto, thick slices of mozzarella, topped with a nice light pesto sauce. Really nice combination, in my opinion. The saltiness from the prosciutto together with the subtle flavor of the mozzarella and pesto is well done. And ! its fairly healthy too ! or id like to think so anyway.   Really nice place to go for a nice coffee and a snack or even a nice meal. Prices are fairly decent and reasonable. Decent amount of sitting space. Free charging station and wi-fi for those who needs a quick charge during their meal or while working on their electronics !",

Might need an extra hand.  The guy at the counter wasn't very social either. Short. Sweet (or lack there of). And to the point.

The chocolate almond croissant is even better if you've got a craving for sweets like I do. It's got enough chocolate to satisfy that morning craving, but subtle enough so you won't regret it. The pain au chocolat ($2.70) and apple turnover ($2.70) are great too -- light, buttery and flakey.  I'm not as crazy about the sandwiches. The rustic sandwich was too much bread and not enough filling. It was pretty good on that rare bite when you get the perfect ratio of ingredients in one bite, but more often than not each bite was nothing but bread.  Still, I love this place. It's the best spot in the area for a quick morning bite.",

That didn't happen because the portions are generous. We didn't even finish what we ordered lol both items that we ordered were super rich and savory! I loved it but I'm glad we had that little side salad that came with the sandwich to cut through all that richness. The place was small and quiet. The service was friendly enough and was pretty fast. We had a great meal and enjoyed the little cafe. I took the leftovers home and they were still good after reheating. We plan on coming back to try a sweet crepe and some of the delicious looking pastries and desserts!",

I was looking for a cake, but they only had single serving pastries/cake slices, so I decided to go with what I felt was the most festive looking treat - the orange pinwheels.  Not only were they pretty, but they were very tasty - flaky, crispy, sweet (but not overly sweet), and tangy.  These treats were well liked and were quite delicious with a cup of hot coffee.  I also got a plain mini croissant and a pistachio roll on the side.  The mini croissant was very flaky and tasty.  The pistachio roll was pretty but didn't have enough pistachio flavor for my taste.  The pastries here run for about $2-$4 each.  They are pretty large, so one pastry with a cup of coffee would be just the right size for breakfast/small snack.  The bakery was pretty crowded when I came by - maybe that's why the cashiers weren't warm and friendly?  They weren't unpleasant, but the service here is nothing to write home about.  All in all, it's a pretty solid bakery with decently priced pastries.  I will be back!",

It's so small and closes early, so if you work hours like I do I suggest going in the morning or on a weekend. It's worth the time! I feel like the employee looked at me a little sideways when I tried to pronounce the food - which is not only okay with me but PROOF of the delicious authenticity of their food!   I could not figure out what to order from the menu because it wasn't super clear. That could be an area of improvement, but for now I suggest checking out Yelp pics to see what looks good. I was with two of my friends, we all ordered something different, and everything was stellar. I really don't think you could go wrong with anything they sell here! My sandwich was so big I could hardly finish. The only thing I would change is I got my sandwich with a egg on top and if I did it again I think I would skip the egg. However, my partner wanted my egg anyway so I gave it to him and it all turned out great. The side salad is basically lettuce with a honey mustard type dressing and I was a fan! After we ordered we sat at a  small table by the window. The real light in this place from the giant windows is so nice!   I also got a vanilla latte which was to die for! They delivered it to the table as well as the rest of our food. When we were done they instructed us to leave the mess on the table and they would get it. I like that service at a cafe! All in all, service and food are both amazing. I'm a huge fan and I will be back!",

I was informed there was no food available except the quiches and pastries displayed. That wasn't a huge disappointment because I wanted a quiche so I got the florentine one which has spinach mushroom onion and swiss. I also got a vanilla cafe latte.   The quiche was so delicious and cheesy I love the variety they offer. I will definitely try other kinds next time. The latte was delicious too. Very strong and flavorful and just sweet enough!   The woman who helped me was very kind I'm assuming she is the owner since it's a little family owned place. Definitely a nice place to hang out and use some wifi or read a book.   Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I need to try a pastry and maybe sandwich before making up my mind for sure but I will definitely return.   Support local businesses people!!",

    "text": "*this was a draft review started a month ago**   Yesterday I was greeted by a red hair woman with a super friendly demeanor seemed knowledgable in their menu items. I ordered the Quiche Florentine with a half mocha & white chocolate mocha ice espresso and a coffee flavored eclair for dessert. I obviously got overexcited and my total turned out to be $17. I would say their menu is just a teeny bit on the pricey side but I definitely think it's worth it. They don't use microwaves here which I think is totally cool. They have tons of desserts ranging from colorfully assorted macaroons to tiramisu, different kinds of tart, and cheesecake! This is a bakery in addition to a cafe, so they also sell various types of baguettes, pastries, and coffee beverages.   I saw someone else's review, and they had a hair in their food so, fingers crossed that it wouldn't happen to me! As I finished my order, seating was readily available but it's good that I ordered when I did because suddenly there was a long line! And that red haired woman is the one taking orders, making the beverages and also prepping the baguette orders! My table beside the bottled drinks fridge was a little dirtied from a previous customer but I wiped it away.  Their Quiches are delicious! They don't use microwaves here, did I mention that already? My food was fresh & so, so tastey! Their iced espresso drinks could be a little bit better though. It would be a perfect combo to sit out on their patio with my quiche and a really good mocha espresso, but it seems their espresso machine/coffee lacks in taste.  I love love LOVE this place though. Yummy desserts, tons of breads, food choices, & drinks!",

Their almond croissant is my favorite; they are able to make a pastry that has the perfect balance between flakiness and denseness with an indulgent almond paste topped with slivered almonds. The paste gives the croissant a hint of sweetness that just makes it perfect.   Definitely try their almond croissant, but their chocolate and regular croissants are also amazing, as well as their crepes.",

I was informed before-hand that the quiche items on the menu were really good, so most of my attention was directed towards those items as I browsed the menu. Upon asking the man working the register about some of the items he didn't seem to be too knowledgeable, particularly when I asked about the quiche items. He was nice however, and offered a coffee while I waited for my comrade to show up.  I ended up ordering the bacon quiche with a salad on the side. Absolutely loved it! Altogether this is a nice quaint little place with plenty of seating for their business volume. The True score for this business earns somewhere between a 4 and 5, however Yelp doesn't do non-integers for their reviews, only whole numbers or non-negative integers; and I'm a round-down kinda guy. Except when collecting commissions.",

I had the cream of mushroom crepe, an iced white chocolate mocha, a Nutella brioche, and some macarons.  There was literally two workers but everything was served so quickly. There was a cashier and a chef. As soon as I placed my order the cashier made my latte and gave it to me before I sat down! What gives, Starbucks?! It was pretty good too.  I shared my brioche with my cousin and it was really good. It had a generous amount of Nutella in it and was sprinkled with some thick sugar.  Then my crepe came! It was so good. I've only had sweet crepes but I don't think I ever want a sweet crepe again. I believe cheese is sprinkled on the crepe maker before the crepe batter is put on. Then they put sauteed mushrooms with goat cheese on the crepe before folding it over to serve. It was so decadent and rich. I advise sharing.   I like the the indoor seating and out door seating, I like how they have complimentary lemon water, and I like how their savory foods are really affordable. Their pastries are a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I can have a delicious breakfast, brunch, or lunch here for less than $10.   I rated it a 5 for affordability, I-can't-make-this-at-home factor, taste, and the how bad I want to go back factor. Two thumbs up.",

    "text": "This was my first time here and asked several friends for brunch on April 9. The food was average for American French food. I have been to France many times, so maybe my expectations are a bit high but yes, average. I have been to other French bakeries in Vegas that are indeed better.  As for my experience and service here, it was way below average! You can read my fellow Yelp Elite brunchers reviews, Christie L. and Kevin L, to back up my claim.   I ordered a Croque Madame ($10.95) Medium Caramel Cafe Late ($4.05) and a fruit tart ($4.90)- I called for confirmed pricing. I asked the man behind the counter to choose a dessert, he said the \"Fruit tart\". This is important to my story.   I got my food in a timely manner with the exception of the fruit tart. Kevin L. got in line to order and asked about my tart, response of they were making it. That made no sense, since it was in the display case. 1.5 hours later, still no tart. I asked, who I assumed was the manager about it when he came to our table. That's when things got interesting or as my other table mates said \"INTENSE!\".  The man who I assumed was the manager went to the counter, came back and asked for my receipt. I searched in my purse while he started to go a bit agro along with my friends teasing me to clean out my bag. I saw him making hand gestures pointing to himself than to me. I was a bit shocked when he said \"You need the proof of receipt because it's your fault!\" I am not joking! My other friends can confirm what was said. He walked to the other table and I could see him in the corner of my eye, my friends were saying how horrible service was, bad reviews, he shouldn't talk to me like that, etc. He came back and started acting as if he was doing me a favor by saying \"You didn't pay for this but I am doing you a favor and giving it to you\" \"Your welcome!\" I explain to him what was said during my order and I requested no receipt since I payed with a card. I remembered that after that Initial bombing of words. I got the tart and he was trying to be super nice telling me a story and asked why I looked sad. Whatever!  We all left, went to another French Bakery and discussed what happened. I looked at my credit card records and found the total of $21.51!! I have proof that I was charged for the fruit tart!!",

We also tried a chocolate eclair and the tiramisu. They were both outstanding!! The French roast coffee was some of the best coffee I have had too.

I did get the almond croissant which was very large and was a breakfast in itself. Dreams! I also prefers the Croque Madam, and it could have fed two. It was perfect in every way! I will be going back just so I can try the pan au chocolate, I hope they have couigen aman next time (they hadn't made any for the week).",

We have a microwave and I'm sure if I didn't take it to go they'd warm it up.   That Danish was sweet and scrumptious! It was pretty large in size too. YUM. The caramel latte was perfect and the canele was fantastic.   This was just a quick trip and I'm convinced I have to try other noms there! There was so much to choose from that it took me a minute. Next time I go there, I want to try their quiche and their crepes. *heart eyes*",

When they were out of an item we ordered, they personally called and walked my co-worker and I through the menu to find something comparable. The food was phenomenal and it was clear that the ingredients were fresh and each delicacy made with care and expertise. I had the pleasure of visiting the cafe today and experienced outstanding service. The kitchen was pristine, and I watched as they made my quiche from scratch. The prices are reasonable, the menu offers a delightful variety that suits even the pickiest of eaters. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

The two gentlemen that were there were so friendly and recommended things on the menu when I couldn't decide what to get.  I was recommended the Croque Madame which is a ham sandwich, in sourdough bread with Swiss cheese, Dijon, bechamel sauce, and a sunny side up egg on top. It sounds like a lot, and it is a lot, but I really enjoyed this sandwich and all its cheesy-ness!  My sister and boyfriend each ordered the Paris crepe, which is much more simple: ham and Swiss cheese wrapped in a crepe with a sunny side up egg on top. They seemed to really enjoy there dish. It wasn't as heavy as mine and a good amount to fill either of them.",

Everyone I've brought here has been pleased. The variety of pastries is really beyond what you would find at most places. They range from super rich to subtle and the breaded pastries are crispy and soft not overly crunchy and sticky like I've found at other places. This place is great for breakfast and even better for lunch. The outdoor area is comfortable and quiet as the parking lot is not super busy. I recommend the eggs Benedict for breakfast and the crock madam for lunch. The order times are quick for the fresh meals. I recommend strongly.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place out. Ever since my roommate introduced me to macarons, I was on a mission to find a non-Strip French bakery that made them.   My boyfriend and I took my 5-year-old goddaughter here last weekend on Saturday morning. The inside is super cute and there is a little patio outside. When you walk in, you see the counters just lined with pastries and baked goods, and that image just brings me such joy!  I was like a kid in a candy store.   The cashier wasn't the most friendly or helpful, and I was a little taken aback since I was so giddy to be there. We ordered a cheese and ham quiche, a fruit tart, cheese Danish, croque Madame, and 2 of each macaron they had, and a latte for me. It came to about $40. Eeks! But I was excited and didn't care.  Our food didn't all come out at once so when the fruit tart didn't come after everything else was served, we thought maybe it was on its way. The cashier must not have heard me order it though because it never came. Also, my receipt wasn't itemized so I really don't know if I ordered it or not, but we just let it go.   The croque Madame was amazing and our favorite. Everything else was really good, but I must say I was quite disappointed with the macarons. The shells were crumbly and some had air bubbles. I also wasn't a fan of the filling. I was expecting my latte to come out in a big round coffee cup, but it came in a to-go paper cup, which was also a little disappointing.  Overall, it was a good experience. I really want to go back and hope that our experience is better. There were a lot of things on the menu that I can't wait to try, like the crepes and various other pastries, and I can't WAIT to have another croque madame!",

    "text": "The sign says French Bakery & Cafe, not La Belle Terre. Knowing that will make your life much easier. They're located in the Great American Plaza near Paymon's and Nothing Bundt Cakes. They are currently undergoing an ownership change, but no changes in business or management (which should mean no changes in product either).  It's very quaint and I love the abundance of pastries and breads. There's certainly no shortage in variety. I was absolutely drawn to the five types of quiche! I wanted to try the chicken version, but the gentleman behind the counter forgot to put one in my box (sad face). So, I'll review them on my next visit! Anyway, I took my selections home to share with my fiance.  Pain Viennois ($5.50) with white chocolate chips and pistachio paste. Very yummy! The bread is soft and chewy. I love the sweetness from the chocolate chips and the pretty green interior!  Kouign Amann ($3.50), pronounced kween-ah-mon, is a traditional cake from the Brittany region of France (originating back to the late 1800's). It's difficult to find and has only recently become popular and available in the states. It's similar to puff pastry since it's made with layers of dough and butter. The texture is chewy, dense, and has a nice crust on it. This was my first time trying one, so there's nothing to compare. It has a nice flavor and it was definitely enjoyable, but we both agreed that it wasn't our favorite pastry.  French Epi-Baguette ($3): It had a nice crust and chewy center, definitely what you want in a baguette. Not my favorite baguette in the flavor department. My measurement is eating it fresh (or lightly toasted) with just a touch of butter. It didn't have me reaching for more.  Almond Croissant: I love open-faced croissants. They're packed with flavor and I love the streusel on top. When I bit into this croissant, it immediately reminded me of marzipan (almond meal, sugar/honey), which set it apart from other almond croissants. Very tasty.  The pastries and bread were surprisingly hit or miss for me, however, everything was still good. It's a little bit of a drive for me, so I'm not sure how frequently I would return. Although, I would like to try their quiche and sandwiches.  Note: Don't forget your Yelp check-in offer of 10% off your bill!",

There's about 10 tables in the restaurant, but they have a few tables outside as well.   We ordered several items to try a little bit of everything. I had the croque madam, the amman, my husband had the quiche and the cheese Danish, my sister had the crepe and the apple turnover. Not one bad thing. The crepe wasn't anything spectacular, but it wasn't bad.   I definitely recommend checking this out. I will be returning for sure.",

I had a bowl and my mom had a cup of soup. She had a medium iced tea and I had a large iced white mocha. Total bill without tip was $19.xx which I thought was rather expensive. The soup came and I was not disappointed. It was very cheesy which I like and the flavor was good. The onions were extremely tender.  After we ate I looked at the pastry and bread cases and was disappointed with their selection. I am hoping it was because it was already 1pm and maybe they had sold much of their product. Mayb3e I will give them another try but with so many great places to eat in Vegas, it is unlikely that I will make it back any time soon.",

The only reason I stopped in to check the place out a few months ago was because for some reason Nothing Bundt Cakes in the plaza next door decided to close shop early. A normal person(girl) in my situation would've just admitted defeat and moved on...but no... my craving for something chocolate or sweet was driving me insane.  Things to order... -Pain au chocolat -Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie -Blueberry cream twist   Last but definitely not least  Mmmmm...Kouign-amann!! These pastries are probably the closest thing to heaven you can come into contact with on earth. I think the chef may be an angel sent from god to bless us who live in Las Vegas with delicious Kouign-amanns.  They also have fresh breads, soups, and sandwiches.  Service is always on point. All of the drinks and pastries were reasonably priced and the selection is great! Something for everyone!  ***10 percent off with your Yelp Check-In!!!",

The owner made time to speak with everyone to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal and experience.  Food was very tasty (good).  Pistachio macaroons were my favorite out of the 4 flavors that I tried.  Atmosphere is nice as well.  Pastry display is very elegant and grabs your attention as soon as you walk in.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!",

My personal favorite is the rustic sandwich - a remarkable combination of pesto and prosciutto served on a delicious Parisian baguette. The staff is friendly and the cafe itself is clean and nicely set up. The coffee and the chocolate croissants (so long as they are warm) are also rave worthy.",

    "text": "The Skinny: solid French pastries and breads (4) Service: it's counter-service, so nothing special but they have a plug in bar for your electronic devices (N/A) value: French pastries and breads in the neighborhood? Score! - the earth is truly beautiful! (4).  The very first time we came to check out La Belle Terre we got there at opening. They'd barely pulled out the pastries and buns from the oven and we were eager to satisfy our carbaholic cravings.   We ordered a small sugared brioche, an almond galette, a pain au chocolat and a quiche. As soon as we got those items in our hand, we dug right on it while the pastries were slightly warm and oh so delish!  The pain au chocolat was nicely flaky with the chocolate slightly molten on the inside. Just the way it should be. If you notice in the pics, there's no sagging in the middle of the pastry because of the even layering of butter and pastry dough.  The almond galette had tons of almond filling inside which is a major plus - I love almond filling. Again, the puff pastry held up with despite the filling inside. The blueberry strudel was really good and not overly sweet. The small sugared brioche was amazing - that lovely eggy buttery goodness fresh out of the oven was really wonderful.  The only thing that wasn't up to par was the quiche lorraine. Although the flavors were okay, the crust didn't hold up to the moist filling and was soggy. I would not recommend getting the quiche here.  Round two - we tried the Napoleon and a loaf of fig/walnut bread.   The fig/walnut bread was okay but I felt the texture was a little too dense for me and could use a little more figs and walnuts.  The Napoleon was pretty good - nice pastry cream with the layers of flaky pastry but not too sweet - although I feel like the previous pastries we'd tried the first time we came was better.  Added to the things to try are the soups and sandwiches here.  In addition to serving up some pretty good pastries, they also serve Peet's Coffee & Teas here which is a major plus. They also have free WiFi with a nice long power bar to plug in your electronic devices while you surf, sip and nibble your morning/afternoon away. What a neighborhood gem!  For serving up a dose of France in the middle of the desert, this place deserves a 4 starred review.",

The coffee (a Peet's Coffee authorized brewer) is medium-bodied with a big buzz, and it's what keeps me coming back.  Great bicycle parking if you're within pedaling distance. Would be a cool spot to host a Cars & Coffee West Vegas - Sunday mornings?",

    "text": "Quiche alert! My how I love a good egg pie, so whenever I spy a contender, I have to give it a try. At La Belle, they had about five options, all baked in individual crusts and served with a side salad. I opted for the ratatouille, which features mixed vegetables, and the flavor was super savory. I could have eaten another one right then.   They are serving up Peet's Coffee and Tea, and although I have experienced Peet's previously, today I was reminded that it is pretty much crack liquefied. I had one small glass and felt altered (in a kinda good way?) all day long. If you are a Peet's fan, you can get a cup fresh brewed here.   However, the real star here is in the baked goods. If you want to die and go to carb heaven, this will be a good starting point. Brian, the owner, has a lifelong passion for baked beauties, and he has partnered with a French couple to create small batch breads from quality cultures. Their sourdough looked and smelled superb, as did their entire selection of baked temptations.  And, for all of you WiFi junkies, they have it for free as well as a thoughtful bar with endless plugs for your electronic devices. The only danger is that you might gorge yourself on pain au raisin before you can complete your task.   A new local gem with a passionate business owner... what's not to love?",

Both were phenomenal and the portions are huge. Also, I got 10% off for checking in on Yelp, so it made it that much more awesome. Can't wait to try other things on the menu.",

The wait in line was 20 minutes, and there were only 2 in line.  The contents of the sandwich were very good, but the wait was about 15-20 minutes for the sandwiches and the staff was not very friendly. It wasn't very busy, just a private party setting up and a few other customers. But there was a sign stating that they take their time in crafting the sandwiches or what not. The thing is, when you have 2 or 3 waiters/helpers just sweeping or standing around, then yes, I'm going to be upset. I wanted to try the pastries..but with 2 people in line, that would've taken an hour.  I'm heading back to my friendlier and better tasting Sammie's at Patisserie Manon.",
