I found this place outside of the strip on Las Vegas blvd - this was by far the best spaghetti I have ever eaten next @Robert Palumbo spaghetti. I will give Joe 's 4.5 stars. Rob you still get 5 stars.  Don't be fooled from the outside the food is amazing and to my surprise. Please open a store in Orange County CA!",

    "text": "Oh boy! This one hurts me to write. I really enjoy the food from Joe's. The pizza is one of my favorites in Las Vegas. However, I will never eat there or order from there again. This is a customer service review, or lack there of. I was thinking of the best way to take in this golden knights Stanley cup playoff game. I couldn't think of any thing other to eat than my favorite pizza, Joe's. The only problem is they don't deliver to my neck of the woods. But thank god for grub hub. I ordered my dinner from them at 6:26pm and my pizza eta was 7:10-7:25, not too bad. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the clock strikes 8:00 and I'm hungrier than Rosie O'Donnell after 10mins on the stair master. So I give Joe's a call just to make sure everything is on the up and up. Well thats where my story sadly takes a turn for the worst. A young lady by the name of Sara (who turns out to be the manager) with a snarky attitude informs me that they were \"VERY BUSY, and received in TWO whole orders at the same time\" and then went on to say \"well yeah we didn't check our tablet, did you want us to cancel your order? Next time you can call us to order it for delivery\" I say \"well I'm sorry but I ordered on grub hub because you don't deliver to my house\" \"YES WE DO. MY delivery driver would've taken the order to you\" so I ask \"your driver works for grub hub?\" \"Well no but they deliver\" So I say \"yes please cancel my order\" then I pause and say \"I love the food here and I'm just disappointed with your customer service, I unfortunately won't be back here.\" She then goes to say \"well I told you to order over the phone next time. I would say that I could comp your next meal but you said the you're never coming back so no use in offering that to you now, is there?!\" Wow just wow. Sad and hungry is where I am now. I feel like I'm wasting away faster than ***Spoiler Alert*** Spiderman at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars. \"Mr. Yelp, I don't feel so good.......\"",

Second  star is for the size of pizza and slices we recieved in the  extra large pizza it was a nice surprise. After that we were quickly disappointed the taste was very simple... Which I like simple clean authentic Italian food but it really lacked taste all around. I think for the $$ they should step it up a notch and revamp those flavors. I give it only worth $. If your looking for a memorable experience of flavor in pizza when ur in Vegas pass this pizza up its really not worth the stop. Good luck for the search of amazing quality pizza!!",

I have not ordered a full pie but I have been to Joe's lots of times for a quick lunch before heading off to work the night shift.  The bare bones staff is very friendly and you can tell they are good people.  At the counter you'll find a few different pizzas on display for slices.  They'll pop it in the oven for a minute and you're good to go.  Inside there are a few HD televisions on the wall, with at least one on ESPN at all times.  If you know anything about the economy, you know that food prices has shot through the roof, especially for those who make and sell pizza.  Thus, prices have gone up on my pizza slice over the past year.  It's about 5 bucks for a slice and bottle of water (don't quote me on that) but it's totally worth it.  Looking forward to my next lunch there.  I only with it wasn't next to the Tropical Smoothie Cafe because it's like being torn in two trying to make that decision.",

Favorite pizza in town!!! Hands down! We get the hawaiian! A little on the expensive side, seems like there was a price increase lately. Other than that, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "First time here on a little weekend getaway to Vegas. The pizza itself was really good! The crust was cooked perfect and everything tasted amazing! It was a spontaneous choice of what to eat and we weren't disappointed But a downside was the price $30 + tax for 8 slices of pizza and one drink? I mean that a little much I think but prices vary everywhere that's fine. But what really got me was the rude cashier with glasses. If I'm gonna pay $30 + for my food at least be nice and show good customer service. I asked for ranch twice , the first time she was rude like it was such an issue for her to do her job, the second time she rudely told me no that she would have to charge me now. I was in a great mood walking in and I walked out in a bad mood thanks to her little attitude. Put a smile on your face lady. If you don't like to serve people don't be in the business of doing so.",

The name of your place is Joe's Pizza By The Slice, but you don't do by-the-slice at night. And to top it off the employees acted like this is something I should have known when I expressed surprise.  To conclude, Joe's Pizza By The Slice does not sell slices at night. You figure that one out... Maybe at night they can darken the part of their sign that says \"by the slice\" so they're not misleading customers.",

Nice touch!  Thanks Kris for making our visit extra special with the aloha spirit shining through.  Just wish I would have found this place sooner - I've lived here 6 months and it was my first time in.  I'll be back!",

The chicken are big and fat and dry despite specifically asking for extra crispy extra wet wings. everything today was just gross when i went for my first time yesterday it was good and for my second time today it was just disappointing most likely won't be back unless it's on a thursday in hopes of getting the same cook i got the first time.",

    "text": "A little pricey for pizza but since it's on Las Vegas Blvd, you have to expect that.  The staff is always super nice and the pizza is to die for! They have a huge variety of different toppings and if you're buying by the slice, it varies on what's available because they have sooo much to offer.  The last couple of times I was in, they didn't have the white truffle pizza available by the slice, which is my favorite.  You can't go wrong with anything there, though. Ask for a side of sauce to dip your crust, it is a little bland by it's self but goes really well with the sauce.",

I immediately asked a girl behind the counter if the fries were coming out. She looked at the cooks to see if the fries were made and they said no. She looked at me and said it will be out in a few minutes. We ate our entire meal and never got the fries and never got an apology. The girl served other patrons and never acknowledged us.   My dad also ordered the chicken wings as hes a wing fan. He got the wings and after tasting it immediately said the wings weren't fresh or crunchy, which he requested. We asked the guy who served us if we can get deep fried wings like we were told instead of the oven baked they gave us. He said sure and comes back with the same wings stating he didnt know until then that their deep fryer was not working. My dad said thats fine and tried the wings again and kept saying it wasnt fresh but didnt want to be a bother. The next day he told me that he had stomach aches and tummy trouble all night! I guess he was right and they served nasty old wings not cooked the way it was supposed to be. Awful service!!!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place as I heard pretty good things about this location.  Having been my first time here last month, I was excited to take my son here as his favorite food is PIZZA.  One of the good things here is they do sell pizza by the slice.  They have an assortment of pizza made and will heat up your choice in their oven OR you can have them make a pie to order.  My mom had a slice of the hawaiian, I had a slice of the mushroom and pepperoni, while my son had the pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  As we sat down and waited for our order, the couple next to us took their slice back as we over heard that there was a strand of hair on one of their slices. Can I just say YUCK! and what a way to spoil an appetite.  I debated whether my family and I should request for our money back or just wait and eat our food.  When I saw that their slice came from a different pie, we just decided to stay since we were really hungry.  The slices are generous; however my mom's Hawaiian was soggy!  She couldn't even pick it up to eat it.  She had to use a fork.  When I told the lady at the counter about it, she merely stated that it was due to the slice actually coming from a Pie that had just been taken out of the oven...ummm ok but I do recall having pizza to order and it not being soggy and thought to myself, ok if thats her story and she's sticking to it...so be it...LOL!  My slice was just ok and my son...well he oved his garlic knots and just took one bite of his pizza.  I will end this with, I've had better and will most likely not be returning to this place.  I'll stick to Grimaldis or Metro pizza.  I would put this place in the same category as the pizza places inside a mall's foodcourt.  Nothing fresh and/or special about it.",

There was absolutely no pretense....a bunch of cool New Yawker guys just putting some pie together.  Some good sports on tv.  And, if you went at lunch, all the working class rolled in.  That is a good sign.  The last few years the guys were gone, the pizza did seem to have the same zip and then on my last visit (this checkin) it became obvious someone's mom took over the place.  Faux tablecloths, and tried to make it look all pretty.  Totally stripped the vibe of a local, authentic pie house.  Pizza was ok.  But, mostly it seems like a nice place for a tourist to pop in, not the local NV Energy line work or Metro cop.",

In 2 min, my buddy's pizza was hot and ready in a box. Another 10 min go by, 2 other customers had ordered and I'm still waiting for my pizza. The guy at the counter pulls slices of pizza from the oven but walks past me and gives it to the 2 people who ordered after I did. I asked the guy, \"Where's my slices?\". He said, \"Did you order a combo too? I'll have those slices in 30 sec.\" Another 5 min go by and I see him about to walk to another customer when he makes eye contact w me, his eyes get big, runs to the oven to see my burnt black pizza. Him and his supervisor put another 2 slices in there, which they didn't tell me they did but I saw them. In another min they finally give me my pizza w only a \"Here's your pizza!\" There's no, \"Sorry for the wait.\", \"Sorry we burnt your pizza.\" Or \"Here's a free slice or coupon.\" Just a \"Here's your pizza!\"  I'm a service guy, if your food is awesome (which it wasn't), you still have to have decent service. I wish I wouldn't have gave that $1 tip on that receipt. Never coming back here again. BS",

    "text": "Was driving by on my lunch break and was looking for a bite, I saw the sign and decided it was cheat day and what a great way to cheat but by doing a Pizza.  It's been months and the Za gods were calling me!  I walked in to an almost full shop, love the decor and seemed very clean.    I walked to the ordering area and started to read the signs on what to order.  Tons of choices not just pizza a few salads to choose from, pasta, calzones, appetizers as well as many choices for pizza.  None of the prices were written down on the chalk board so as a newbie it made my ordering difficult.  Finally on the side wall I notice 4 lunch specials and all you can eat all with prices written down.  This was a cheat day but after noticing the size of the slices I decided to just wing it and order just one slice.  So I worked my way to the front and asked what a couple of the Zas were.  I don't know if I was taking to long but the girl wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed by my questions.   I choose the lasagna pizza, a light thin NY style pizza with a nice amount of zesty sauce pepperoni, sausage, mozzarella cheese and either a ricotta or cottage cheese on top.  The dough had a great flavor I even ate the crust and the whole thing was REALLY good!  When you just order lunch or by the slice it is pre made then run through one of the ovens I believe the oven was a wood fire not sure but it had a nice smokey flavor to it but I didn't want to bother the girl and ask.  I would definitely make it a do over, I took a star away for not having any prices written down makes it hard to decide what you want when you feel you may be holding the line up, and for the slight attitude from the worker.  I would certainly come back for the great Za though.",

I went online and quickly found several delicious options. The Gigantic size and Humongous size are only a few dollars difference so I went for the largest size. The online ordering was really simple and allowed for ordering as a guest instead of requiring an account. Payment is handled at the end of the ordering process and it was only 45 minutes for delivery.   The Pepperoni Pizza was my favorite. The flavors were great and it was a good kind of greasy. It tasted like a sneaky diet splurge. The crust was okay, but not particularly notable. The Hawaiian was also delicious. Ham and pineapple on pizza is always a delicious option.  Since I was ordering for a group I went with safe bets, but Joe's has some interesting options. I was surprised to see options like Hungarian Chicken (!) and Chorizo.

She was barking orders at the employees and said she would be there in a minute but she only had two hands. I really wasn't in a hurry but the way she snipped at me it was as though I had complained. After a few more terse statements she took my order. I ordered the all you can eat as it is the best deal.  She stated you get two slices at a time till 5pm nothing gets taken out.  I am a bit afraid to cross her in any way and by her demeanor I was wondering if I needed to show my plate after I finished the slices or if the crust counted or not. This is not the relaxed way that a meal should be eaten. In conclusion, the pizza was good but there are plenty of pizza places that make you feel at home. The tension from her between the employees and even the customers was palpable. She may be a nice person but she does not belong in the service industry.  The rest of the employees however were very nice, especially after she left and they could relax.",

It's pretty small, but that gives it a homey feeling. It's decorated cute. My 2 year old loved the Statue of Liberty in the front. I was also super happy that the Fast and the Furious was on one of the tv's :)  We ordered mac n cheese bites, a small white spinach pizza, a small super meaty pizza, and two drinks. This came to $43! Say what??? This place is way overpriced.   The mac n cheese bites came out quickly. We decided we wanted to dip them in marinara sauce, but my husband got a weird look from the person behind the counter when he asked for it. He felt uncomfortable. The bites were pretty good!  The pizzas came out pretty quickly too. My white spinach pizza was very good. The crust was delicious, and the mozzarella cheese was fresh. Two thumbs up.   My husband says his was okay. He wants to go back and try a calzone. He was also bummed they don't serve beer.  We want to go back, and take my son! Good location, cute place, and good food!",

When I walked in, I didn't feel like I was in Vegas. It felt like a mom and pop pizza joint on the east coast. I liked the homey vibe and decor.  Few things about this place:  - walk up and order at the counter. - they have pizzas already made, order by slice -- they heat it up in the oven before serving it to you. - option to order a whole pie, but it would be a bit of a wait.  - all you can eat option, $9.99  - punch card for single slices   Ordered the Meat Pie by the slice, filled with toppings top to bottom. Layered with pepperoni, sausage, ham, meatball, topped w/ mozzarella & bacon. It's a thick & hearty slice, could easily get full off one slice. I liked it. Some slices were filled w/ spaghetti, which made it more filling yet not satisfying. I didn't like it. Prefer it without spaghetti. Don't rely on my photo, it looked bigger in person.   It's an okay place. Try it for yourself. It's not pizza I would go out of my way to get or crave, so I'm not sure if I would be back again.",

Other than that my experience was less than adequate and the meatball sandwich my mother ordered was the most horrible sandwich I have ever tasted. I'm Italian, so I really think that I can give a great review on Italian restaurant. You normally add breadcrumbs to meatballs as a binder however the meatball sub here should've been called a bread ball sub. Tasted as if this restaurant was so cheap they added no meat to the meatballs. The bread which is to soak up the sauce and hold together completely fell apart making my mother use a fork to eat her sandwich. The sauce was decent in the cheese was good but for the price absolutely terrible. Now on a positive note I'm sure they have amazing pizza. It looked good and it smell good and the patrons seems to be happy, However I can only go by my experience. A meatless,dry, under seasoned, broken sandwich doesn't make for a happy hungry Italian mother. I won't be returning.",

However: If you are a college student like me who only cares about what the food actually tastes like and not if it's healthy, then by all means find the nearest transportation and go, go, go!!!  I ordered the Joe's Favorite which consists of cheese, pepperoni, and bacon. The crust was soft, the slices were huge, and they were also easily foldable, so that the toppings didn't fall off!  Plus: It was delicious!! The bacon in no way overwhelms the flavor of the pepperoni. In fact: I don't know what kind of pepperoni they use, but it was like POW! Pepperoni Explosion!!! Sailing along on a boat of cheese with a zesty tomato sauce undercurrent.  I loved it, and I went despite all of the negative reviews that I read online. (Some of these people don't seem like the type that have ever eaten cold leftover pizza for breakfast.)  So my fellow college brethren, THIS is the pizza for you! To all of the fine-dining connoisseurs out there I say - Don't ruin it for the rest of us normal people!  Delicious, delicious!! I think I may eat another slice! ^_^  P.S. I got the 16-inch pizza, haven't tried their \"pizza-by-the-slice\" yet. P.P.S. They were playing Journey when I walked in! JOURNEY!!!! That sealed the deal for me!",

We also got our pizza before our \"starters\" which makes no dang sense to me whatsoever. All in all, I'd go back for the food but wouldn't dine in.

    "text": "I just downloaded Yelp and signed up specifically to share my latest experience with Joe's NY Pizza.    I enjoy their pizza and have been in the restaurant and have also had delivery service several times.  Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.  The expectation that was set with me was a delivery time of 45mins to 1hr.  After a little over an hour passed I called to check the status.  The employee who answered the phone immediately gave it to someone else who let me know the driver was going to be at the store in 5 minutes to pick up my order and that he should be at my house in 10-15mins.  After waiting 30 more minutes I called for another status.  Supposedly someone did not take my phone number or address correctly and the driver was trying to find my condo which they've been to at least 10 times for me before.  I don't understand why they didn't just look at the phone number that called to get all the customer information they have in their system.  I asked if they were going to deliver me cold food now or what?!  The guy on the phone said they'd make me a new order and get it to me in 30mins.  I asked if I was going to get a discount because of the negative customer experience that Joe's NY Pizza is giving me and also because I've now been waiting for over 2hrs for my food.  The guy on the phone said he'd give me a \"locals discount\" of THREE DOLLARS!  THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!  NOT COOL.  I've lived down the street of this place for over a year, ordered from this place several times, and now all of a sudden I'm getting a \"locals\" discount of $3 to make up for a shitty experience....c'mon man.  A major level of incompetence began as soon as I placed the order and for the management of Joe's NY Pizza to make me feel like this was my fault is simply rude.  After he said I'd get the \"locals\" discount of $3 (lolololol) I mentioned this was obviously not a good experience and that I was going to post a Yelp review.  He didn't care at all and said that my food would be delivered in 30 minutes.   Too bad they treat \"local\" repeat customers in a such a negative manner.  No apologies, no discount, and no accountability.  Really not cool at all and am very disappointed.",

I hail from the land of GREAT pizza, (NY and Philly) so I was pleasantly surprised with finding a good NY pizza place in the land of notoriously bad pizza, aka Las Vegas.  I had the daily special which was around  $8 for 1 pepperoni and 1 cheese slice with a soft drink. The pizza was really good. It could have been hotter but since they were trying to serve 28 of us I think they hurried the process a bit.   The end crust was way too thick for True NY pizza but not a big deal. There was plenty of seating and the place was really clean.   Some other people in our group were noticing that Joe's did not serve beer which is strange for a Vegas eatery so not sure what happened there. (They booze you up everywhere else in this town).  If you want a slice of NY pizza this is the best one I have found. So far anyway......",

Joe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers.   Their lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1/2 off during lunch.   We walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either.  BUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had.   The space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:  1. Walk in and head to the front counter.   2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.  3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.    4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch!   5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter.   6. Enjoy!   We absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have.   You all must vis",

The dough was crunchy, the sauce was mild yet flavorful... It was perfect. I tried the other pizza, tomato and basil, and it was good as well. A little skimpy on toppings but still good.   After getting the pizza we decided to try the chicken alfredo. It was mild yet very seasoned. When I say mild I mean it's not too heavy on cream and butter, even though I think there's no such thing as too much butter or cream! For a light pasta, I really enjoyed it. There was so much chicken in there that the dish was actually heavy. I wish I could find this good of a value in LA!   I really like the decor. The tablecloth looks like newspaper and they have old school brands on the walls. There's nice pictures everywhere and even a Statue of Liberty! Very unique decor.   The bad? The customer service could be better. I've never gotten amazing service in Vegas so I don't know if it's the area, but I'm used to a little more friendliness. The prices could also be a little better. I understand this is premium pizza, and it's good and fresh, but $4 is a little high for Vegas. I expect better prices since this place is a ways away from the strip.   The whole pizza is a good buy compared to the slices. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area because finding good pizza in any city is a rare find",

We asked the order-taker to just pick 5 of his favorite chicken wings and make 10 each for us. They were a huge hit. We also ordered a pepperoni, Hawaiian, grandma cheese, and another pizza. They were all excellent. We picked up our own order. It was ready on time. The staff was very friendly and the food was superb. Our whole family loved the pizza and wings. We'll be going back.",

Ordering through Amazon was fast and easy, but the pizza arrived luke warm, almost cold, so not even the cheese stretched when biting into it. It was taken out of the warmer or never placed in one so it didn't stay hot on arrival. The garlic knots were over cooked, some pieces almost burnt and they were hard to chew because they too were not hot on arrival. Very dissatisfied with the food. Although I will probably use Amazon again, I will never order from Joe's NY Pizza again. I've had N.Y. pizza and they should be ashamed comparing themselves to it.",

It was slow to start, but that's not their fault considering I think we had like 10-13 people with us but once they started to get things going, it just kept coming. So onto the food!  The spanish chorizo pizza had bits of chorizo on it and to me wasn't that special, but I'm also not a big fan of chorizo, but it was still good.  The stromboli no matter what you get is delicious, it's filled with the right amount of cheese, veggies, and meat with the right amount of dough that it was delicious and tough to put down to make room for other foods!  We got hungarian bread, which I believe is just fried dough with a light sour cream sauce that had garlic and some other seasonings that I couldn't make out, but the combination was phenomenal! I don't think I can have bread again without that sour cream sauce. It was super light so even if you don't like sour cream or think it's going to be overpowering, it wasn't.   Escargot pizza - well....it is what it is, snails on a pizza and I was VERY skeptical about trying it but I'm glad I did, it wasn't bad at all. My FIRST experience with escargot and I probably wouldn't order it on my own, but it is definitely something you must try at least once!   We also had pepperoni which was good, but it's pepperoni nothing special with that.  And dessert was homemade zeppolis with cinammon sugar AND powdered sugar, you have to get both on them! Not one or the other, but both! They are delicious, just be careful when you get them, since they come out HOT!",

The crust is soft and chewy, the cheese and toppings are plentiful, and the sauce is tangy and not too heavy. I miss their breaded mushrooms but their mac 'n' cheese bites are a worthy replacement. Their wings are great and sometimes you'll get an extra wing! I've learned to double check my orders before leaving because there's been a mistake once or twice but even when I brought home the mistake orders (wrong toppings) I still ate those bad boys. Their pizza by the slice is a great way to try new toppings. I highly recommend the lasagna pizza! They deliver but I always do pickup because they're really close to me. They have 2 or 3 tables outside that are good for people watching. The staff is friendly and pretty helpful if you have any questions about menu items and that's always a plus. After trying this place it's easy to see why they're award winning.",

In fact everyone loves them..... we serve over 400 customers a day, which is over 12,000 a month.... and over 144,000 a year.....\"  My take on the response is an ellipse is \"...\" and anything more is the unwritten insult (big time slap in the face), like typing in all caps.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been coming to Joe's NY Pizza for years! We go to the original location on Paradise and frequently visit the Las Vegas Boulevard location. Love both spots and the people are also great too. We bring friends/family here all the time!   FOOD   My must-try items are the Grandee Pizza (award-winning pizza), White Truffle Mushroom, Hungarian Chicken Pizza, Garlic Knots, Chicken Wings (Voted Best in Las Vegas) with the Mango Habanero sauce and the Italian Panini. Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also throw in a dessert item. For parties, I cater from Joe's NY Pizza and I always get the biggest pizza size which each slice is bigger than the size of your head! Always get rave reviews on the food when I get catering through Joe's.   CUSTOMER SERVICE   Excellent! I can barely think of a time when they didn't treat us well. However, we are locals that frequent the place. But, I think when you're loyal to a place they should treat you well! Both locations also offer delivery within 5 miles so you can order pizza to your hotel if you'd like. Their delivery service is also excellent.   PRICE  I Joe's NY Pizza is fairly priced for what you get. The portions are big, food quality is high, service and location are awesome and you get a pizza stamp card so after X-amount of pizza orders you get a FREE one. You can also sign up for their VIP email list and get a coupon for free chicken wings. They always have great deals so just ask them when you go there. They'll always be ready to help you!   I love this place and will definitely come back here again!",

I got the lunch deal that ends @2 pm (not sure what time it starts) but it was 2 slices of pepperoni pizza with a drink for $9.00 plus tax  if u wanted cheese pizza it's a dollar less so 8.00 plus tax and any \"specialty pizza\" is 10.00 plus tax. They all include drinks. Without the lunch special , prices were a little higher. The pizza slices were decent just a little too thin. I feel like you could have got a whole pizza box elsewhere for that price. Other than that, everything was good. Staff was friendly",

    "text": "Haven't ordered from here in a couple months, but today was craving my usual Meatball sub and decided to go with a Stromboli instead. I also got wings naked, extra crispy and BBQ sauce on the side since my girlfriend likes that and I like hot sauce so I have plenty at the house. She got the meatball sub and a cannoli and I got the cheesecake. The food arrived when they said it would and the nice little older Italian lady dropped it off and said \"you haven't ordered in awhile\" always a friendly interaction which is rare these days with delivery drivers. My Stromboli was the best I ever had, stuffed with meatball, sausage, peppers, pepperoni, mozzarella, onion and ricotta. Her meatball sub was great as that's what we ordered the first time so decided to stick with it, but I wanted to try and see what else they did so great. To our surprise, the sub always comes with a pickle and a bag of chips. Wings were great also and prepared just how I asked, crispy with bbq on the side, they also had celery and ranch on the side that I didn't even ask for. Paper plates, utensils, Parmesan cheese and Red Pepper flakes also included. She said her Canoli was the best she's ever had. I'm saving my cheesecake for later, but I already know that's good. I still have half a Stromboli and some wings left for round 2! I found this place on the eat 24 app and had gone through so many other places in an attempt to find something similar to where I grew up on the east coast. Every neighborhood had that family owned pizza shop that was where you ordered out if you lived on that side of town. They knew you by name. Everyone from the delivery driver, to the guy that made your pizza. I've been looking for \"that place\" since I moved to vegas 6 years ago. They follow instructions and go above and beyond, most of all the food is amazing. These guys are legit and it took me a long time to find this kind of quality and class. Can't wait to try something else next time.",

I went there tonight to pick up the same thing I ordered which is a chicken pesto panini and yo my surprise, the sandwich shrunk into a bagel size and they no longer give you salad on the side, yet it was still 11$. That happens a lot when a business is good they shrink their portions and try to cut corners which eventually would hurt their business. I'd go to pAnera bread and get a huge panini for 8$.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, absolutely terrible.  I had been craving them and literally couldn't even force myself to eat more than three bites.  The sauce was watery and bland and the poor little meatballs looked burnt on top of the fact that they were tasteless, had a weird processed texture and for some bizarre reason were cut in half.  Gross.  The garlic knots were soaked in grease .  I'm not talking about yummy garlic buttereyness but more if you melted half a stick of margerine and topped it off with a generous dose of vegetable oil.  The delivery service itself was good and their online ordering system was easy to follow however, the quality of the food was so poor I will definitely never order from them again.",

Either they got it wrong or changed the menu we're not sure. My other co-worker ordered the Chicken pesto panini which they made on the spot and described it as \"effin awesome.\"    Overall the novelties like the fried mushrooms are always a hit just expect to pay a little more by the slice.",

I hate doing this, I'm not generally one to complain, but one of the new employees happens to make me extremely uncomfortable. She's pleasant in a corporate robot sort of way, she doesn't make jokes or ask how my day was. Which I'm not saying they should roll out the red carpet for me, but I feel that is just common courtesy to ask simple questions like that. I've stopped coming in as regularly and usually try to avoid her. All the other employees are great, I have nothing ill to say about anyone else, just this lady. I don't know her name, but she's on the tall side, not exactly skinny and doesn't do her job well.  The food however is excellent! I suggest getting delivery! Definitely the best pizza in town.",

We waited less than 15 minutes for our pizza to cook and it was well worth it. I like the variety that Joe's menu offers, and the quality of their pizza dough is what really seals the deal for our family. We like our crust this but not crispy or crunchy and Joe's New York Pizza does it to perfection. Of course we will return to try a different OMG delicious pizza.",

We thought maybe we should eat at this pizza place so we don't have to pay through the nose for airport lameness.  I ordered a pre-made slice of some pizza that had tomatoes on it, and I kept saying to myself, \"wow, surprisingly this is really good pizza\".  Everyone else at the table felt the same.  The atmosphere is clean and nice.  They have a TV playing sports and one of those fancy touch screen soda fountains.  The restroom was way nicer than similar restaurants and actually clean.  The employees were nice too.  We go to Vegas 2 or more times a year on business, and have our normal places to go... we are definitely adding Joe's to our list!",

    "text": "This was my first time experiencing this pizza. My best friend is Hungarian and has raved about this place and the ownership (they are Hungarian).  I am writing this review on behalf of her. It was her first time at this location, she ordered carry out (she usually orders from Paradise location). 2 LG special with a 2 L coke which came out to $40 (not the cheapest pizza place).  One pizza was spinach and goat cheese (brilliant) and the other, mushroom and roasted red pepper, no cheese.  We got to her house, and the roasted peppers have seeds and are spicy. Not a little, but very. That pizza was for her daughter, who loves roasted SWEET peppers, which is what you get when you order \"roasted peppers\" anywhere else.  She called the location, to let them know they should at least let their customers know, \"Hey, our peppers are spicy, is that okay?\" Instead, she got someone on the phone who barely spoke english. He put her on hold, then a while later \"Alberto\" or \"Arturo\" answered the phone, and asked what she wants to order. Obviously, communication was lacking.  She explained again, what the problem was. His response was \"Oh yea, our peppers are mildly spicy\" and \"people don't usually have a problem\" \"we didn't know it was for a child\".... HORRIBLE customer service. No apologies, no \"can we remake it for you?\", no remorse, or even taking ownership of the problem.   We have both been working in the food service industry for over a decade each and especially for Las Vegas standard this place is seriously lacking. Small businesses especially, can't afford to afford a customer base, because as we all know, one bad experience gets spread faster than a good one.   This customer could have been saved by a simple apology. Especially since displayed by the cash register, was a signage that said \"Joe's is committed to pleasing its customers\".",

They were already sitting there for about 5 minutes when I got there. They had ordered a spinach/ricotta/mushroom pizza, wings, and an antipasti salad. The woman had brought over our food around 9:05 ish. We started eating, but as we saw someone bang on the door because it was locked, we then asked the girl if they were closed (not reading the sign) and she said yes, we close at 9 but take your time. Ten minutes later, she even asked us if them cleaning was bugging US! I guess this kind of service is rare to come by in Vegas, so when I find a joint where they make you feel comfortable and homey, I get super ecstatic!  Now the food! Probably some of the best pizza I've had in a really long time!!! Super doughy and soft! Everything tasted so fresh. As for the wings, my parents had ordered them extra crispy, and extra crispy they made them... I don't particularly care for crispy wings, so they weren't my fav.   If you're looking for a quick pizza joint, with great service, definitely should check this place out!",

But the pizza wasn't balanced with an overabundance of cheese which fell off the pizza when we tried to take a slice.  We did like the sauce but the crust was too thick and a little doughy.  And lets not forget, the best test for good pizza is if its good for breakfast the next morning and this one wasn't.  It was good when fresh and quite filling.   Three stars as the staff was friendly and efficient, the location is great right outside the outlets, and the pizza fresh was average.

Affordable prices and good portions.  For me, this place is pretty average.  It does get pretty busy during lunch, so I'd recommend coming early or going late, or else you may have to wait a while to get your food.",

It's not rocket science, you look at what the customer ordered if you care about the customer you make the pizza the way the customer ordered it.  There will not be a third opportunity as these guys apparently don't pay attention.  I paid $30 for a pizza I could not eat because it had mushrooms on it.  That's $30 in the trash....

Every slice of pizza I tasted was just absolute perfection. Not to mention, they have a wide variety of specialty pizzas so you can try a different kind every time you visit. My favorite was the Greek white. It had just the right amount of cheese, sauce, and delicious toppings that made my mouth water over and over. Best part about this place is their location and their weekend hours. Open 24 hours Thursday through Saturday, which is perfect for those late night pizza cravings and they're on the south end of the strip which means they have a have the perfect location to appeal to locals and tourists. Worth stopping by and grabbing a slice next time you're in the area.",

They are perfectly cooked and have never been overdone. They have a nice doughy center and taste amazing. I normally hate mom and pop shops however when I first came here their pizza and sides were one of the best things I've ever had. Even their wings were great. Honestly for the garlic knots alone I would go all the time.   However, the reason they have 4 stars is cause their service sucks. The employees are extremely rude and condescending. Even after being condescending one of the times they lost our order and we ended up waiting there for almost over an hour. Finally when I approached them they didn't say sorry they just still kept a rude attitude and gave us our food. I keep coming back because the food is great. But the service is really bad. It's been like that almost every time We have gone in. If the employees had a better attitude they would have 5 stars for me but if I have to rate the restaurant as a whole their employees make it a bad experience.  The restaurant is located off of Las Vegas Blvd. have not been to the other location.   Hi Peter , thank you so much for your response and concern. It was in the middle of the week around 5 or 6 and it wasn't busy at all at the time.",

My son and I got the meat special, wife had the feta and spinach and daughter had pepperoni.  Took it back to warm it up and it was out fast.    I see that someone said the crust was burnt, but I found it just enough to be crispy on the ends.  Not greasy and plenty of toppings.  Tomato sauce was to everyone's liking, but I still added some extra cheese at the counter.  If this is any testament as to whether it was good or not, two sets of police officers walked in for a late night bite.  Follow the cops if you want a good pie.  I would go back when I am in town.",

Who doesn't love pizza happy hour?   I was in a rush, so I had a slice of the white spinach pizza (so I can truthfully say,  \"I have eaten vegetables\")  and a classic pepperoni.  If you're in the area, you should pop in for a slice or get it delivered. You cousin Joe will take care if you. Just don't tell him, he's funny, since he might ask you how is he funny, and things don't go well after that. Just take my word for it.",

When I went from almost ordering a small pizza and being taken aback by the price this was the opportunity for the staff to tell me about the 'all you can eat slices for $9.99'! But they didn't do this so it impacts their rating, information is important!  The pizza (pepperoni) was average nothing special and definitely not New York Pizza. The crust was too thick however the sauce had a nice flavor not too sweet. There was a nice balance of ingredients but I'll pass on trying them again!",

The pizza was good pizza pie, although I was a little oily and the oil ran down my wrist when I tried to take a bite, but nonetheless delicious.  The only reason I have them 4 out of 5 stars was the cheese was a little rubbery and I didn't really like the texture.   I would love to dine in to see if my experience changes with the texture... maybe it's better when it's fresh out of the oven!",

Love their pizza but I'll just order from the Eastern location when I am at home to enjoy their pizza and while at work I'll just order from the not so great place so we aren't stressed out trying to put in an order or hopefully I can put the local discount online to avoid this issue.

Usually we eat lunch at 1p, so the delivery time was never considered until I planned a 12pm spring Bday celebration. They store doesn't open until 12. Not only was the pizza up to standards, they were able to get the pizza here around 1220p. I was so happy we didn't have to wait for ever, so thank you guys.   The only reason i did not give five stars, is the online order fields are black and you can not see what you are typing.",

As you walk in they have high top tables in the center, half booths on one side, and booths on the other side.  They have ready made fresh pizza's on display sold by the slice or you can choose something from the menu.  They have a pretty good menu of appetizer, pizza's, salads, subs, pasta, and desserts.   I went with the 10 pice wings mild.  The wings were so delicious!  It hit the spot.  The wings were cooked just right with the right amount of crunch and the flavor!  OMG!  My new favorite place for wings.   The meatballs were amaze balls which I snuck a taste from the meatball sub which comes with chips.   I shall be back for more wings and I'll try a pizza next time along with some dessert!",

Then they bring it out as if I was eating it there. I told them it was a to go order. They were not happy and threw the pizza in a box dislodging the cheese from the crust.  Got home, pizza was undercooked. Pepperoni was raw. Dough was not cooked.   I hate to say it, but a $4 frozen pizza cooked in my oven for 15mins is 100 times better then the raw pizza I got last night.",

    "text": "Just from the taste of their Hungarian pizza, I give this place a 4 star. I was still a little full when I got home from a disappointing meal from the outlets and I already knew that I needed a back up meal after getting my gyro. So I went to a to this place which was really close by. I like chicken pizza and they had a unique one. The main components were something they called chicken paprikas, which I think is something they marinated and seasoned with, dollops of cream through out the pizza and I think little tiny amounts of mushroom? That's my guess...I believe that they left the sauce out on purpose because of the toppings but it worked out really well, just like other sauce less pizzas that I've had, surprisingly. Like I said I didn't eat it right away, so it was slightly below warm and although the mozzarella wasn't oohwy gooey anymore, it was still really good! Now that's a sign of a good pizza. Next time I have make it a point to at least take a bite while the pizza is still warm, to be able to know to know the difference and enjoy the experience.  The guy at front took my name, but ended up bringing it to my table instead and with plates already with it. Usually I have to ask these places for them. But he didn't have parmesan, peppers or napkins. Other than that I highly recommend this place and will be sure to try out their other offerings.",

Ordered a 12\" half cheese, have pep pizza plus the baked potato fries. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either.. It was.. Okay, plain, ordinary. Plus it was $13.xx for a 12\"? That's ridiculous. I actually would prefer the traditional fast food pizza chains (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns) than this.. The dough tasted very \"yeasty\" if that's even a word. There was little sauce and little cheese, but a lot of bread. Actually now that I think of it, it almost tastes like frozen pizza like Digiorno or something. The baked potato fries were okay, but the fries were extremely soggy. Only positive thing is that they put a crap load of bacon!",

A coworker always had Joe's New York Pizza and it looked good since I had never been I figured why not.  Checked out their menu online and placed the order for one of their 3 Item Monster Calzones.  The calzone was pretty huge for the price so I was very happy at first.  It was load with ricotta, mozzarella, marinara, and a ton of pepperoni, no exaggeration.  Only thing I didn't like about it was the dough was undercooked.  I was literally eating uncooked dough that had a little toast to it.  It's a good thing work had a little toaster oven I throw it in and went back to work, the room smelt so good.  I don't know if they usually under cook their calzones or if it was because I customized my calzone and didn't know how adjust for that, I don't know.  In the future I'd asked them to leave it in the oven longer.  I have to give them solid OK considering I could've gave them a MEH for undercooked calzone dough but I heard they have AYCE pizza during lunch or before dinner, don't know the details but that's cool.  And from what pizzas I've seen looks pretty good.  They have a good selection of items on their menu. I like the interior and that you can order online.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place! I've lived in Vegas for 18 years and I just tried this place the other day and fell in love. Amazing quality in every thing you order. The meatball parmigiana sub is my personal favorite because the meatballs are amazing as well as the homemade sauce and the roll they use is toasted and is crispy on the outside and soft as heck on the inside and I have tried the Buffalo chicken sub as well as a Hawaiian pizza. Everything tasted amazing. The pizza dough has a great flavor and the sauce is perfect. Every sandwhich meal comes with a bag of chips & pickle included which is a very nice compliment to the sub. They also offer 9.99 all you can eat pizza slices from 2pm-5pm! Have dine in or out. They also have the soda machine where you can have all sorts of drinks! Haha love when places have that machine. Best New York style pizza in Las Vegas hands down. Love the atmosphere and the employees are very kind and friendly and funny. Immediately feels like home. Cooking taste like it too!",

It was just decent. There are far better places to get a slice of pizza in town; Rocco's, Secret Pizza at Cosmo are just two. The guy who takes your order allowed the 4 person party behind us to order before us (we were only 2) and they took forever to order. Switching between specials and asking a million questions...it's pizza people. By the slice. Why so much confusion? We also ordered beer battered mushrooms that were ok. I won't be rushing back.",

BUT THE LEVEL OF SERVICE I GOT FROM THE MANAGER JUSTIN.... and their delivery driver Larry just goes to show they put so much care into making there customers happy... they put that same level of care into the taste of there food... and I grew up in Philly so I know good Pizza and Italian food at 1am in the morning. No but for real both of these guys went the extra mile for my wife, they don't know me from Adam and to them just seeing a satisfied happy person and customer was all they cared to do when the hotels say no they can't or don't want to help... these guys are figuring out ways to make it happen!!!!

Arrived probably 30m before closing to find an employee already cleaning and closing down the lobby area down. We asked if they were closing now, and he said no. Cute establishment The cashier was nice, but did get one of our orders completely wrong.  While waiting the lobby was still actively being closed down, so much for not getting comfortable with chairs being stacked around you.   Now to the food.  I ordered the chicken ranch calzone added some bacon...sad to say chicken was  lacking flavor and a little dry despite the amount of marinara sauce provided.  The size of the calzone was good. My other parties were 50/50 on meals but all agree good proportion size but once again one order was completely wrong so good enough to say that it was a good try for a last minute effort but we probably won't be returning on our next trip :(",

    "text": "We order from here for the office and have them deliver for better service.  There with the delivery service of whole pizzas you are getting something. I think you will find value.  Large pizza with good ingredients and toppings delivered to the office when they promise.  The pizza tastes good.  It is delivered when they promise.  We have had a few mistakes and then will make it right doing what ever they need to do to satisfy the customer.  No complaint at all would keep doing it and plan to.  Thank you.    In the store is a different story.  Thus, the reason for the two stars.  It was a favorite lunch spot for a long time.  We used to go to the location on Las Vegas Bldv. south and order pizza by the slice.  They had the same employees there over the years.  They had a very busy lunch crowd.  They had specials too where you could get cheese and a drink.  They have specialty pizza in the display for sale like chicken, Hawaiian, lasagna, and veg.  They would recognize us when we came in and make the visit fun.    However, that all changed some time in the summer of 2017.  When we went there it was probably August of 2017.  I have not been back to the store for lunch since.  The regular employees were gone and had been gone for some time.  The crowds died down because they are running off all of the customers.  People don't want to be ripped off.  They have options.  There are actually about ten other places to eat within a quarter mile of this place and even in the same strip shopping plaza.     The reason the place is empty for lunch customers is the PRICE INCREASE.  They raised the prices.  Me and my co-worker have quit coming after this.  Two people each getting two slices and a small drink during lunch and the bill comes out to more than $22.00?!. That's insane.  I have been to Joe's pizza by the slice . . . . .oh, I don't know, maybe more than 100 times over the years.  Always get the same thing.  Two slices and a drink for me and two slices and a drink for my friend.  I know how much it should be.  It never ever came out to more than $20.00.  Did you think that people wouldn't notice?  Then the price changed.  I said something and then the woman showed me my receipt and said this is the price.  Four slices and two drinks.  Looked at the receipt (don't remember what they raised the pizza to) but I do remember they jacked to small drink price to something like $2.45.  Really? Won't go back.  Are you kidding me?  I hope this place closes.",

Down the left side of the restaurant when walking in is half booth half chair tables 4 tops. An on the right side is 4 person full booths . Very simple calm color tones . Vintage posters on the walls .   You order at a open counter kitchen a women with a paw on her breast took my order . They have a ton of stuff on the menu . Very big menu ! But they have 3 big lcd tv's displaying there menu. I got a grilled chicken pesto panini , very good for them being a pizza place. Had a lot of great Italian flavor. The price per slice of pizza was rather high starting at $6 an all the way up to 11$ is kinda high. But the woman who served me was very nice an straight to the point.  I love that they have. A coca - cola freestyle machine!   They have a slice club as well buy 9 an get the 10th free . Also if you post s review on Yelp you get a free slice of pizza of your choice  Overall good visit very clean and tidy restaurant I like that they have a open kitchen .",

We ordered the pepperoni with gorgonzola cheese specialty pizza as well as the Frat boy pizza. They delivered it via grub hub in less then an hour, still piping hot. The 2 small pizza between 4 hungry did the trick. We still have 3 slices left over.   Very nicely and evenly baked, the toppings were very fresh and delicious. Crust was perfect, not too crispy, but definitely had a crunch. I had my favorite ranch dressing I get from trader Joe's on hand, so I was good there. We ordered the little donut balls as well, good, but the pizza was the star of the show.  Over all, A+ pizza, A++ on the delivery time, very satisfied pizza lovers over here. :)",

I tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.  The toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept! However where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings.   I don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(  Hit it and quit it, I am done!",

I actually went away from my usual cheese and went with one meat pizza slice and one pepper and onion slice.  Both were delicious - not too greasy, thick crust pizza.  Pizza was cooked in about 10 minutes.  Overall, it's a nice slice of pizza.  I usually compare all pizza I eat to New York style.  I still have not found the True New York slice in Las Vegas, and I'm not sure it exists, but Joe's is not too far off.  The prices are not cheap but not expensive - you could easily eat a nice lunch for under $10 at this restaurant.  I think there are still many more pizza places to try so I would not outright say this is a must stop for tourists, but it is solid if you happen to be in the area.",

We ordered a 16\" pepperoni, which was $30 but we figured it would be better than other pizza...it was served super hot, with no way of plating it onto the flimsy, paper plates, which led to cheese and sauce getting everywhere. The sauce tasted like sauce that comes with pizza making kits at the grocery store. The place we go to, by our house, sells a better and bigger pizza for $12. Sorry, Joe. Maybe try harder to make eating your pies a little easier.",

The slices are decent sized so 2 was plenty for me.  Pretty good.  Not quite the NY style I am accustomed too, if the crust were a bit thinner and the edge not so thick and it had a good coal or wood fired taste...that would be perfect.  Still, pretty good, I'll go back.  Oh, about the pigeon.  The front door was standing open and this sketchy  looking pigeon wandered in and began poking around by the trash can and front tables looking for crumbs.  Serious authenticity points for the mangy pigeon.  I don't know if it's on the payroll or just a regular.  Someone came from behind the counter and chased it out but it came right back so it was obviously from NYC.",

Having said that, I've been here for lunch and they have a pretty quick turnaround on orders. I order the lunch special which is two slices of pre-baked pizza with a small beverage (note the pre-baked pizza is baked that same day and reheated in the oven when the order is made) plus a side salad and it comes to about $8.50.  Considering how large these slices are and the fact that the soda fountain is available for free refills, this is pretty budget friendly.  I also thoroughly appreciate that there's garlic powder on the tables to add to your pizza, salads, or whatever else you may order.  All in all, an A-Ok place.",

This place obviously has some street cred with the Las Vegas crowd.

Even though the tomato itself is not that great, it transforms into a savory violin in an orchestra of flavors. The bread is right on. It's a messy sandwich. The salad that comes with it is weird though. It's hardly any greens, tons of raw red onions and a TON of dressing. Make sure to tell them you are a local to get a discount. Lots of booths to sit comfortably in and they have a small outdoor seating area. I always see families here. Staff is not always the most professional or approachable, but this sandwich makes it all forgivable.",

They also have some interested decor on a wall with a lot of superhero art and vintage signs.       The first time I got a monster vegetarian cal-zone. It had to much onions on it however the cheese and crust were perfect. this made me curious how their pizza must taste, hence my prompt return on Saturday.

(Open invitation to anyone who wants to buy me \"good pizza\" to teach me the difference haha) Anyway...I think 99% of pizza is good. It really is hard to mess up. I think the only bad pizza I've had has been the school lunch pizzas they would give me when I was little. The cheese was oddly white and a quarter of an inch thick, uninspired over added tomato paste, and white as a ghost crust. Then there's the pizza where when the cheese goes cold it turns to really gross plastic. For the most part, I figure it's good pizza when it's almost as good cold as it is when it's hot.  Ok...so enough about other stuff. I think we got a white sauce ricotta spinach pizza. I'm a meat lover but I was going to share this pizza and I know not everyone shares my love for meat (wink wink). I guess I've always been curious about non meat pizzas but always figured I wanted to get my moneys worth and go for the meat. Pizza was really yummy...It was good pizza....i think....I wanted to get everything on the menu...it all sounded super awesome and so many varieties! I think the only problem was that we weren't greeted or acknowledged...but that's the story of my life so maybe I shouldn't hold it against them.  It's off the main strip on a pretty calm side of a mall lot and was like a mile from our hotel. Fun times.",

TL;DR they don't dress like an employees of a restaurant and they ignore you.  First off:  The owner was sitting next to me as the following happened.  I arrive for a quick slice of cheese pizza for lunch.  You can buy pizza by the slice and they heat it up (like s'barros) but better.  Only two people in line and I order the cheese slice and the kid tells me he'll bring it out to me and sit down.   30 minutes later I go to the register to talk to the kid and he walks away from me and pretends to do something else behind the counter!  I sit back down and wait for him to come back to the counter.  He later comes back to answer the phone so I go up and stand in front of him while he is on the phone so I can catch him after he gets off.  I wait and he stalls the phone conversation.  I don't understand why he's avoiding me b/c I haven't said anything at all to him.  I was nice when I ordered too.  So someone who looked like a manager but was dressed like a cheap prostitute with her mammary glands hanging out asked me what I wanted.  I told her I waited +30 minutes for a slice of reheated cheese pizza and I would like my money back.  She looked back and saw a whole cheese pizza and asked if I wanted a slice from that and I told her I felt I didn't feel they want my business.",
