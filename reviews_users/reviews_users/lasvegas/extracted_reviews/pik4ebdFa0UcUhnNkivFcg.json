While in Vegas about a year and a half ago I noticed Carmine's and confirmed it was the same. LOVED IT!! Finally I found east coast flavor on the west coast! Here is a shot of the penne in pink vodka sauce. SO YUMMY!!! Went back last weekend and had it again. OMG loved it!!",

The wine and beer were $5.00. We also had three different appetizers, all of which were very good. We had meatball sliders, with a side of marinara sauce. They were delicious and the sauce was yummy! We also had the calamari with a side of marinara and toasted ravioli again with marinara sauce. Being from St. Louis (where toasted ravioli originated) I've had better, but Carmines marinara is so delicious, made it so good!  The next time we go to Las Vegas, we will definitely go there for dinner!",

We had turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, carrots, green beans, Brussels sprouts, candied yams, cranberry sauce and stuffing. Turkey was kinda dry. My favorite was the candied yams, stuffing and green beans. Tim loved their Brussels sprouts. Overall food was just so so. It didn't wow me. But I do appreciate the family style serving concept.   Atmosphere was awesome. Loved the setting. Feels like a big Tahoe hotel. Two stories. And we were at the second level. Downstairs is where they had the bar and smaller tables. Music was great. Perfect for the party. Service was slow, but good. Drinks were always filled. But we had to ask for more bread. My picky eater child only wanted their pizza style bread.   I'm giving it a 4 star since I don't think it's fair to judge them base off just their Thanksgiving menu.",

    "text": "Ran into this place shopping at the Forum in Caesar's Palace. What stopped us was a table with a big bowl of seafood.  It looked like a seafood cioppino. It had everything seafood in it you can imagine, mussels, clams, shrimp, lobster and crab.  The portion comes in a huge bowl, I kid you not.  Ordered a side of garlic bread and the garlic bread came on a huge platter about 2 feet long with 8 huge slices of garlic bread.  The serving is family style.  If you have a big group you will get your money's worth.  If you are a party of 2, you may want to think about eating here.  It was too much food and we ended up only eating half of it.  We took it to go to see if we could find some homeless people on the bridge that connects Caesar's to the other side of the street.    The ambiance made me feel like I was in New York during the gangster days.  Our waiter had an accent that resembled the guys on the Sopranos.  He was entertaining and very helpful with answering questions from the menu.  We both had a latte after dinner and it was delish!   I took away one star because the portions are large and there is no ability to order half portions.  A party of 2 cannot finish the portions they provide.  It would be nice if they would consider putting half portions on their menu.    Restaurant has inside seating and seating along the Forum side to people watch.  If you like to eat, this is the place to go.",

There were 5 of us and we ordered 3 different dishes since we wanted to get a really good feel of the place and being super hungry!  we had enough left overs to eat for dinner the next day!  They were also advertising that they will be open for thanksgiving! i wish i was going to be in town for that because it looks amazing!  Overall the service was good and they even had 2 tv's for the sports fans out there! it was a great surprise for me since it was football Sunday when we went. Got to enjoy an amazing meal and see my favorite team win!  The ONLY thing i wasn't too crazy about was that the menu was posted on the wall and if you weren't familiar with the menu they expect you to go up and stare at a wall for 15 mins scanning the menu. it luckily wasn't busy when we went to i didn't feel too weird about it but i know if it was packed i would have felt a little put off about standing over someones shoulder !",

    "text": "Super fun meal our first night in Vegas.  Firstly, I love going to Ceasar's Shops at the Forum, such a beautiful area.  Carmines is located inside, and although it looked full, they found a table for my hubs and I.  We were surprised to find that food is \"Family Style\", i.e. portions of everything they serve are for 6 or more people.  So this is a better option for groups.  But hell with it, we decided to order things anyway....  They serve great New York-style Italian food, and LOTS of it!  (*Note: we had so much food leftover, we gave some to the table next to us.. they then gave us some Calamari, which was really very good).  Started with Carmine's salad--  excellent!  Big enough for 8 people, but we scarfed down plenty of it, so good.   I ended up buying one of their cookbooks, mainly just to get that recipe!  Ordered Chicken Parmesan for entree, also great.  After dinner, found they had Decaf Espresso-- hurray!    Staff were all EXCELLENT-- from the hostess to the waiters to the busboy-- they were all so friendly, nice, efficient, great.   A very fun Iand FILLING!) dinner to start our Vegas vacation.  Glad we did, we'll be back (but next time with friends!!)",

We were starving and ordered a ton of dishes- the Italian salad, the Caesar salad, the lasagna, calamari, pasta with shrimp, penne pasta, lemon chicken, and spaghetti and meatballs. It was a lot of food for 13 girls. My advice is to ask the waiter or waitress what's recommended for your party. We couldn't finish our meals and were really not OK with wasting the food. All in all great spread, but huge portions. Remember it's family style.",

We were invited to eat from the awesome hostess that works there.  She warned us to come hungry and not to eat anything all day.  We started off with the fried calamari which is probably the best calamari in Las Vegas.  I'm willing to defeat anybody in arm wrestling over that statement.  This calamari seems to melt in your mouth like an m&m.  Stuffed mushrooms was pretty good as well.    The next portion was a big ol' plate of ragu with spaghetti.  It had meatball and italian sausage links and pork butt.  The pork butt was outstanding.  The italian sausage kinda gave me heart bun later that night but that was ok.    The next dish was Chicken marsala.  Two words.......The Bomb.  One more word...Delicious!    Desert was strawberry shortcake and bread pudding.  The portion side of this dish was titanic.  I wasn't able to sink it though.  If I ever decide to go back I'tt definitely have to be with a crew or a small gang.",

Carmine's is really a place that you shouldn't visit unless you have four or more people.  We ordered a salad with balsamic vinaigrette, strawberries, arugula, candied walnuts and much more. It was MASSIVE.  After that, we ordered a dish that had multiple types of meat in it such as chicken, sausage, and potatoes.  I would definitely come back here again I just need to be with more people so I can actually eat all of the food. Those two dishes cost about $100 with drinks.",

We had fried zucchini for an app and it arrived in a mountain! So much fried zucchini and incredibly delicious. The best fried zucchini I ever had! For dinner we had chicken saltimbocca and their Sunday night special of four pasta - gnocchi with pesto, ziti with meat sauce, veggie lasagna, and manicotti. Their meat sauce is HEAVENLY and the gnocchi was extremely fresh. We are way too much but left so so happy. Some of the best Italian I have ever had!!",

At 7:45, I grew tired of waiting and being ignored by the      apathetic host staff and tracked down the manager who got me a table. Chicken parm was rubbery, but the rest of the meal was good, but can be found anywhere on the strip ( Maggianos, Spagos, etc) My recommendation is to go elsewhere, but if you must dine here, ask for Carl.

The service was extremely slow, taking over 45 min just to get our appetizer.  Once we got it, the stuffed mushrooms were very soggy and not very good for $18.  Our main course came about 30 min later.  The portions are very large, family style.  The food was average with soggy pasta and thin, rubbery chicken.  The sauce was very thin.  The whole meal took about 2 hours for three people.  If you're trying to feed a large group for a reasonable price, this might be ok but for a small family there are better, higher quality options for the money.",

We shared mixed green salad (fresh and tangy), Bolognese meat sauce pasta (noodle cooked right, meaty), Chicken Marsala (tender somewhat under seasoned chicken slices in over-abundant mushroom sauce), and Broccoli (quite garlicky healthy).

We ordered the veal parmesan and lasagna; I like pasta with my chicken parmesan, so I assumed I would want it with veal parmesan as well. It came with 1 pound of pasta! Each entree was roughly $40 each. Not sure what the charge was for the side of pasta.  I don't generally eat meat, so, this was an indulgent treat for me. Sadly, I just was not that impressed with the veal or the lasagna. Both seemed to taste as if they included canned ingredients. Yes, they give you enormous portions, and claim that everything is served family style. However, I would rather have small to average size portions and good food over ginormous portions and not so great food.   Service was absolutely exceptional. Had to be the best service received during this visit to Las Vegas. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was outstanding!  Our bill came to just over $100 before tip. This is generally what we spend for dinner in Las Vegas, however, I would've rather had an indulgent dinner at Mastro's or the like.   When I'm in the mood for Italian food on the strip I'll stick with Maggiano's. At least there I know I'll leave satisfied.  Five stars for the service. However, I'm rating this place two stars overall because it was overpriced and just not that good.",

Food is served family style and portions are massive.  Started out with the Caesar salad which was so big it was falling off of the plate. Because we were so stuffed from that and the basket of bread served beforehand, we only ordered one entree. The chicken Parmesan arrived and it seemed to overflow from the plate. The dish was crispy, and dripping with cheese and sauce.  Everything was seasoned well and delicious. My only complaints, and I am digging for them are the water cups are super tiny, so you're constantly refilling...and because it's crowded, it can be quite noisy. Like I said, I am digging for things to complain about. And a bonus feature is the restaurant has its own bathroom, so you do not have to venture outside to find it.   The food here tastes as good as it smells. If that's not a huge endorsement, I don't know what else is!",

We did not even add pasta to it and enjoyed it even more without all the starch.  Calamari was great too.  Enjoyed wine.  Definitely a place to go to share a plate as they are very large servings.  Very friendly staff.  Great atmosphere.   Will go back.",

    "text": "I did not like my experience at Carmines.  First, there was a party at the bar that kept crowding our table.  they were bumping in to our table, we had no room, nobody could walk down the isle.  I pointed it out to our waiter/bartender, who said sorry about that, but did nothing to fix the problem (which cost him his tip from me, so i hope they tipped well).  Then, because he was so focuses on this group at the bar, it was impossible to get his attention, i had to flag down someone else to go behind the bar and tell him i have been trying to flag him down.  it really soured me on the service.  I wish the food had been the redeeming experience of the evening, but it wasnt.  The Caesar salad had way too much anchovies, the fried zucchini was so salty it was barely edible, and both our pasta dishes had so much garlic that it was all we could taste.  I had been looking forward to eating there for a while, but the entire evening was a disappointment",

    "text": "When our Italian friends who own a pasta company in NJ suggested we come here for dinner, I had to trust them! And boy did this place deliver a fine evening. The food is served family style, so coming with a group of six was perfect! Here's what we shared...  Bread Basket - It featured an assortment of three different breads with olive oil and butter to go with it. Two of the breads reminded me of focaccia - one with onions and the other with tomato. These were my favorites! They were light, fluffy and moist! The last Bread was one I didn't try, but hubby sure seemed to enjoy it!  Caesar Salad - Ever since giving birth two months ago, I have constantly craved the crunch of romaine. So this salad was particularly attractive to me. The croutons were huge, but there weren't too many to be overwhelming. There was just the right amount of dressing so that everything was covered without being soggy. A plate of three anchovies were served on the side. I think our moms were the only ones to indulge in those.   Shrimp in Red Sauce - I'm not a seafood fan at all, but I had to at least try this. The shrimp was quite firm and didn't have the unappealing fishy taste. And I really enjoyed the full sized cooked tomatoes that were in the sauce!  Veal Parmigiana - I've never had parmigiana in my life and I'm so glad I finally have! The crispy breading provided a nice texture with the melted mozzarella. I think this was the most flavorful of all the meats on the table.   Penne with Ragu - The meatballs in the ragu were probably the next most flavorful meat. The sausage and pork were a bit more simple and took a back seat to the delicious tomato sauce. And I was crazy for the past! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly.   What a wonderful evening of sharing with friends and family. This is such a great place for a special evening!",

The menus are on the walls, they do not pass them out so pack your glasses if you are near sighted. They do share a wine menu and cocktail list with the table so you do not have to squint to read the labels.   We ordered one Caesar salad to split for the table - absolutely plenty for 10 people. Then ordered two pastas and two meats for the table. Again absolutely plenty, there was even left overs. Listen to the server when they advise you on how much to order because they know better than you do, believe me.   The food was delicious! The wine was great and the atmosphere was lovely. It's a wonderful Italian restaurant that I would definitely suggest if you are looking for a place in Caesars.",

    "text": "This could have been a 5 Star review. The food was delicious, the service was wonderful, the environment was fun...this place has everything that you would want in a great Italian restaurant. The reason for 1 Star...the waiter over sold us and the management treated us like we just didn't matter. There is nothing worse than any restaurant not caring about what is right/wrong because they know they will always be busy. They are in an awesome location, full of people that come and go, and they don't need to worry about repeat business .  13 of us were there on Saturday night for a work function. Because this is a family style restaurant, and because we were not wanting to go home with leftovers, I had a plan of ordering about 4-5 dishes for the table to share. When it came time to order, I specifically asked the waiter if we had too much food in our order, and he said no, you actually should order 2 more dishes. I was very surprised at this recommendation, as I saw the portions coming out of the kitchen, but, he is the expert and I went with his suggestion. When our order came out, I couldn't believe he amount of food on the table!!!  Food was delicious, I can't take that away from them...but, how do you suggest more than what a table can possibly eat just to increase your bill and tip??!! We had 14 carry out containers when we were done eating!! Again, if we were going home, this would have been awesome, but, we were going back to hotel rooms and leaving in the morning. I asked the waiter why he steered us in this direction knowing that we could never possibly have eaten this amount of food. He simply stated that he wanted us to have a sample of each item. A SAMPLE??? These samples ran up our bill and were very unnecessary.  I asked him how many people does 1 dish serve, and he said 1 dish serves 3-4 people. We had 7 dishes, 2 salads, 1 appetizer for 13 people..you can do the math.  We asked him to take at least one of the dishes off of our bill, he refused. The waiter went to the manger, the manager never came to our table, and we paid the bill. As we were leaving, we found the manager ourselves. He was pompous, arrogant and flippant. This wasn't about money on our end. $30 isn't going to break the bank, it was about someone trying to raise the bill to get a bigger tip.  Very sad that this small amount (1-2 dishes costing $30 each) could not be removed and in the end, will cost them thousands. All of us at this table will tell our friends/family. Is this really worth that much to you??? I mean, let's get real...a box of rigatoni is .50cents..... I wish that I had photos of the food, it would have done this post justice. We boxed up everything, and  made bags for the homeless. The best part of this evening was people on the streets so happy to get FULL meals for their FAMILY ( bread, salad and 2 pastas) and not just a doggy bag for themselves.",

    "text": "Holy Moly! Size does matter I guess this New York iconic place has found it way into my heart here in the heart of Vegas. With large portions and over the top type dishes I am wowed and glad to have this well know Italian Resturant in our awesome city.  If you are looking to feed lots of people with awesome family style food here it is. It is located in Caesars Palace's forum shop not too far from the valet which makes it quit convenient. The Resturant is just as big as the plate sizes. Nothing is small here.   Service was great. We had at least 4 servers with one gal being the main one. Just like any Italian dinner with a hundred coarse they were always changing our new plates for us in between each dish.   The Breezy Italian is a pretty good drink could be a little stronger though. With that said it not only looks good but it taste good. The app stuff mushrooms was good but for some reason mushy.....don't know what it was but I would've gone for something else. The garlic cheese bread was insanely huge and delicious with tons of melted cheese on top and buttery garlic toasted bread. The seafood pasta was awesome good red sauce with all kinds of seafood plus a whole lobster. Some items might have been slight chewy but non the less great. The Lemon Chicken dish was thin and tender, lemony and yummy smothered in a cream sauce and would go perfect with some linguini. The spaghetti and meat ball with big balls was very good as well.   Fun environment great prices for the amount of food you get and lots of delicious options. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone weather they are looking for a casual lunch or somewhat nice dinner without all the up tightness. Great place!",

    "text": "I literally created a Yelp account solely to give Carmine's a review, and if I could give 10 stars I would! We just returned from Las Vegas and had our wedding reception at a private room in Carmine's (the Ritrivo room), and it was BEYOND our expectations. I worked with Kay Kolbo who was absolutely incredible. I am an attorney so am an admitted pain in the ass to deal with, but Kay was extremely responsive to my emails and questions ahead of time, and assured me that everything I asked for would be done. Kay allowed my Mom and other guests to drop off favors before the reception and Kay ensured that they were placed on everyone's seats before we arrived.   Kay also recommended an amazing DJ who everyone loved, and every single person who attended RAVED about the food. Carmine's pre-set menu options also give you plenty of variety to choose different types of food to serve your guests (since it is family style your guests do not select their own meal) and you literally cannot beat the price. I was also concerned about people having to wait a long time for drinks, but Kay assured me that she would not let that happen. She made sure there were at least three bartenders, and even put bottles of wine out on each table ahead of time to help minimize the bar lines - and not a single person had to wait for their drinks at any point in the night.   We had about 90 guests - almost all of whom traveled from Boston and are huge Red Sox fans. Kay made sure that game 5 of the world series would be on during our reception, and even after the Sox won and everyone went nuts - the staff at Carmine's was all for it! I was worried that we may be a bit too rowdy of a group to host a reception in a restaurant where other restaurant guests could clearly hear us outside our private room, but they made us feel like the absolute priority in the restaurant that evening and had fun alongside us. While I may be biased since it was my own wedding, every single person who attended said it was the best reception they have ever been to and we certainly have Carmine's to thank for that! I would HIGHLY recommend Carmine's - especially if you have the opportunity to work with Kay, as she will ensure that your wedding reception is exactly what you want it to be!!",

I was expecting a white cream based sauce so when the dish arrived, I was concerned.  One taste and I was a fan!  The shrimp were huge.   Not at all a fan of family style.  Individual options would have allowed us to each select what we wanted.  Family style ONLY, forced us to compromise.  Of the whole menu there were only three dishes that worked for both of us.",

We had the lasagna, and it melts in your mouth.  No joke.  Fantastic bolognese sauce made with veal.    Service was nicely attentive, and the manager dropped by to check on our experience. That was an added plus.  If you live in Las Vegas, ask about the local's discount.    A fellow local foodie recommended going, and we were not disappointed.  If you want great food, I personally recommend going to Carmine's before Scarpetta and Rao's.  I am looking forward to my next visit. This could be my go to place any time I'm on The Strip.",

We got a lasagna because we were not sure of the portion size. Well the lasagna was delicious BUT that portion was for like 5 or 6 people. I'll definitely come back but with a bigger party so that we can try more than one item. If you don't eat much or are just going with one or 2 people I would recommend you stay in the area where they say they serve small portions and get your own plate. I also think the hostess should be more specific about the portions being very large portions recommended to be shared with 4+ people.",

We did family style for the 8 of us and then 3 of us for happy hour the next day. I highly recommend the Chicken Parm and the spinach dip!  Our waiter/bartender experience was drastically different.  The waiter was nice at first. Then my cousin ask him if he knew he looked like John Cena, he proceeded to tell us how he gets asked 10 times a day and it's annoying.  He went on to tell us he would never say that to someone or approach a celebrity in a restaurant. He also told us a story about how he used to work with him.  True or not. Just take the compliment and move on. Then we tried to talk about dessert and he told me I wouldn't like the strawberry shortcake because I was from the south and it's not the same. We talked more and he said the bread pudding was 'ok'. We decided to leave with no dessert. The bartender was a completely different experience. He was so nice and attentive. Didn't change the TV when asked because we were watching the game. We were there for happy hour but we asked him about the desserts and he was very complimentary. Go for the amazing food and drinks...just don't ask 'John' who he looks like.",

At first we were shocked at the prices, but the server assured us that the portions of food are meant for 3-4 people, which indeed they were. We received a basket of assorted bread as we waited for the spaghetti and meatballs that we ordered, but the bread was unappetizingly cold and rather unsatisfying to the palate. The pasta came out within an acceptable time frame, and the pasta was served to us from the family size platter into individual plates. The pasta was very very salty. Indeed if you enjoy strongly salty pasta this is the restaurant and dish for you. I, however, left with lips slightly puffed from excess sodium absorption.   I will be giving our leftover pasta to the first homeless person we meet on the strip. I hope for his sake that he has access to a lot of clean drinking water.  Overall, I expected better food from a restaurant that received such high ratings on yelp.",

Waitress told us all food is made to order, isn't it usually?  Couldn't just order the caponata, though, would have to get other cold antipasto items I don't eat. So much for \"made to order\". Couldn't get baked clams either since they have cheese in them (premade?) and am allergic to cheese.   Clams were ok; got more onion focaccia for dunking in broth.  Shrimp were ok. Maybe 15 average size shrimp. Not rubbery. Brought out wrong pasta dish, had clams instead of calamari. Replaced it in reasonable time.    Food wasn't as bad as it could have been, just wasn't special. Took too much effort to find dishes that three people wanted to share, rather than a lot of dishes which we could all taste.  Also, restaurant needs to have smaller tables.  We were originally shown to a table for six (!), but convinced hostess that a booth for 2 (?) would be more comfortable and conducive to conversation.  Everything is large portions; pasta can be bought in supermarket for $.99/lb.  Only thing that is not large portion is glass of wine.  Not served in a wine glass, but in a small drinking glass.  Family style like this was trendy in late 1980's.  Now people would like a small taste of a lot of dishes rather than find a few upon which everyone agrees.  More isn't better, it is just more.",

Unless you live in the local area and can take food home, you really want to go with at least four people.  We ordered a salad that could have easily fed four.  As it was we ate what we could and left the rest.  It was a Ceasar salad and the waiter asked if we wanted anchovies in the salad on the side or not at all which was nice.  For our main course we ordered seafood pasta.  Again we had a choice of what type of pasta we wanted and there were several.  The seafood consisted of clams in the shell, mussels, lobster, and calamari rings.  There was a choice of white or red sauce for the pasta.  We got the white which turned out to be a very light and taste wine, garlic, herb sauce which was wonderful and made good use of the basket of bread we had on the table.  While the price seems high at first glance,, the reality is that when you consider how many people one entree can feed it's not.  Our total bill including my wine was $97 and as I said we could have fed more people.  If you too four people you could get two entrees and everyone would leave full and probably have left overs.  We would have loved to try dessert but alas, we had no room left,",

Knowing that we are going to need some left over we decided to get two pasta dishes.  We got the ragu with the three types of meat and this other vegetarian one.  To be honest, if the pasta was not so salty it may deserve a 3 or 4 star.  But oh my god, I have no idea who put that ridiculous amount of salt in the pasta, but I was drinking a cup of water for every bite of pasta.    I definitely do not recommend this place considering how salty the pasta is.  Not worth it.",

Listed below is what our meal entailed: (Hope it helps)  Calamari: The best dish of the night.   Carmine's Salad: Don't waste your money on this. The salad tasted bitter.   Beef Tenderloin: This was their Thursday special but don't waste your $79.99 because there is nothing special about this plate. It took over an hour to come out and it looks like a lot of meat but in actuality they stuff the plate with a lot of potatoes and layer the beef on top. It was dry and unsatisfying.  Vodka Pasta: Good dish nothing to rave about.   I recommend if you want to eat at Carmine's book a trip to Atlantis!! :)",

    "text": "Really getting off to a bad start here.  Arrived to dine at Carmine's at Caesar's Palace and its a bustling place.  Since I'm by myself tonite, seated at bar high-tips.  Apparently normal tables are reserved for two or more and feature family-sized meals.  I'm ok with that.  Reviewing menu, got my eye on Veal Scallopini.  Turns out menu is -completely- a la carte.  Server lets me know the Scallopini comes \"without mushrooms or pasta\". I am like WTH?!  Any self respecting Italian diner would never serve just the cooked veal by itself.  But, hey, this isn't Italy, or NYC...it's Caesar's and apparently the owners of this joint shredded the home country cook book long ago.  Seems Prices here are nosebleed as adding simple pasta to my $44 Veal costs an extra $12.  I did notice most of their bottled wines are roughly two to thee times retail but I settled in a nice Sebastian Merlot to accompany dinner; bought the whole bottle to save money.  Then to top it off they don't serve wine with wine glasses.  Instead they use small cocktail glasses that would normally be used for drinking Grappa or Vodka but apparently is more traditional in Italy.  Portion of Veal arrives on pasta and spinach, as requested, but it's a huge portion.  Overall taste was very basic and bland.  Hardly any spice or flavor.  Normal mushroom cream sauce is noticeably absent.  Noodles were buttery but not \"al-dente\".  All the other menu items are priced as whole-table portions so for a desert of Tiramisu, expect to pay $45 for a big portion.  Overall this restaurant plays on the Italian lineage of NYC but the service was slow, wait staff impatient, and quality and taste of food marginal.  Good thing this place is in Caesars, where people are literally begging to throw their money away.  That promises a never ending stream of non-discerning customers.",

She said take a seat at the bar and we will let you know when the next one is available. We sat and had a cocktail and then watched a couple walk in and take a high top. I approached the \"hostess\" and she said oh no it's first come first served, I said that is not what you said, well I guess the manager overheard and they seated us at the next opening.  Servers were overwhelmed and had to ask 3 times for bread and we were sold on a side of pasta with olive oil and roasted garlic.  It came out just plain.

    "text": "As I pondered what I really wanted for dinner out after Diane would return from playing poker, I pretty quickly decided that it had to be \"Sausage & Peppers\".  Putting in that search term on Yelp, I looked for where I could find a great rendition of this Italian staple.  And the best reviewed dish seemed to be at Carmine's, where I recalled I had enjoyed this once before.  A color photo of this entree, which happened to include onions as well, sealed the deal for me.  So when Diane returned, off we went to the Strip on a busy Friday night for me to satisfy my craving.  Even though Carmine's serves platters family style, neither Diane nor I cared what the cost or overage would be.  We could always bring home leftovers.  After finally reaching valet parking at Caesar's Colosseum, we strolled on over to Carmine's inside the Forum Shops, and secured a table for two at 10:15 p.m.  The place at this late hour was still 2/3 full.  Supplied with a table for four looking right onto the mall walkway, we were ready to get down to some serious eating.  And so we did.  To get things started I ordered a Caesar Salad, which arrived with enough Romaine Lettuce to feed six diners.  At our server's suggestion, I ordered it with light dressing, and extra dressing on the side, so leftover salad would not get too soggy.  But, alas, the extra dressing was not forthcoming.  So, I had to ask for it again, meanwhile masticating very thinly dressed leaves and a few croutons.  Finally the extra dressing arrived.  It was thick and viscous, and when ladled on the great expanse of lettuce leaves made all the difference in taste.  Strips of Mozzarella Cheese and an ample supply of nicely seasoned croutons in cube shape also contributed to an authentic and well-flavored Caesar Salad.  When ordering my entree of Sausage, Peppers & Onions, I sought to augment it with still more ingredients.  First were Roasted Potatoes, but this was changed to a side of Contadina Potatoes when Diane decided that she wanted them to go with her Veal Marsala without mushrooms, too.  Then I imagined the Red and Green Roasted Peppers mixing with Penne.  So an order for Penne was placed.  When separate platters of Sausage, Onions, & Peppers; Contadina Potatoes; and Penne arrived and were conjoined by me, I decided that something was still missing to meld everything well together.  I tried to put my finger on the absent ingredient, and soon came up with the solution.  It was Marinara Sauce!  So I asked an attentive busboy for some Marinara Sauce.  He said he would check with our server to see if an extra charge applied, and I replied, \"It doesn't matter.  Just bring it.\"  (Ultimately I was not charged for this.)  When a hot bowl of wonderful mild Marinara Sauce soon arrived and was mixed with the Sausage, well-roasted Green and Red Peppers, nicely sweated White Onions, and memorable Roasted Potatoes, it was just the thing to make my entree whole.  An hour later I had consumed half of the platter of salad, and a little over half of the Sausage, Peppers, & Onions; while Diane was able to polish off five of seven scallops of veal overlaid with delectable Marsala Sauce.  Together we also ate most of the Penne, and consumed all of the potatoes.  I gladly paid a bill of over $150 for two, and didn't mind.  For, all of the food obtained would have comfortably served six, and I finished off a quarter more of the salad and all the rest of the Sausage, Onions, & Peppers at next day's lunch.   While the hostess and managers were friendly, and our busboy fairly attentive, our sever was not.  Besides forgetting to bring the extra salad dressing, he only asked if I wanted any more Iced Tea once, just as I was looking around to request that of him late in the meal.  So I was only furnished with two Iced Teas in the space of 90 minutes.  And then after asking our waiter if he could box up the unused Caesar Dressing to go with the salad, he said, \"Sure!\"  But when we arrived home, no such dressing was in our to go bag.  He also had a habit of referring to me repeatedly as \"Buddy\" when I am silver haired and likely more than twice his age, which I thought was not very professional or appropriate.  So, while the food was again five-star worthy in quality and taste, the inattentive wait-service this time lost a star.  What was promised was not always delivered.  I will still return, because the service was exemplary the other two times I have dined here, and the cooking here is first-rate.",

The bar is huge so there's plenty of room but there are also high top tables in the same area but not attached to the bar for some privacy.   We came in after a concert and were starving so we were delighted to find out there was a late night happy hour. We ordered quite a few things but the ones that stood out to me the most was the Mussels in Red Sauce and the Fried Calamari. The sauce with the mussels went great with the garlic bread but I would have really preferred it without the melted cheese on top.   As the waiters brought out food for other tables, the portions looked HUGE. Next time, I'd definitely come back with more people during happy hour so we can enjoy those specials AND order some of the larger dishes.",

I entered Carmine's due to a wedding (the reception celebratory dinner was held here). Upon entering I was engulfed immediately with the atmosphere. It has an aroma that embraces the era where men retired to the den with a glass of scotch and a cigar. I loved the amount of wood and the fact that the menu was plastered every wall. You'll pretty much choose what you eat before you even sit down.   We got sat in the back room and had a pre-fixed menu. The table was pre set with a sampler bread basket and waters in front of us. The assortment of bread was odd and many of the flavors left a sour taste in my mouth. Oh well, you can't complain about complimentary bread.   To start, we were given an enormous platter of calamari and ceaser. The abundance of the two starters alone was overwhelming. If you come, I recommend sharing a plate rather than order one for oneself. Trust me. Unless you're a competitive eater, or just have an insatiable appetite, you won't finish.   The calamari batter was was overly salty and I found myself drinking more to quench my thirst.  The ceaser salad, it was probably the best part of the meal, sadly. However, it still was too much for me. It was overly dressed and the dressing had an odd taste to it.  The gluten free vodka pasta made me feel so horribly for everyone that has a gluten allergy. The sauce lacked all flavor and the pasta itself? Odd. Just odd. The shrimp with wine sauce was horrendously oily and ended up making me feel so nauseas I couldn't even try the other dishes. To much of my dismay, the dishes that followed looked more appetizing and were raved about. Ugh. Such a shame.  Overall? I loved the atmosphere and the service was on par to what I expect Vegas service to be. However, the food left much to be desired. I would've much rather liked to go to the Cheesecake Factory that was nearby.",

The ceremony was held on the upstairs balcony  which provided a great backdrop of the strip lights of Las Vegas. For dinner the wait staff was amazing! Mia was very helpful and kept our drinks filled. Everyone was great. After the wedding Mia even walked us through the shops for a short cut to the Uber pick up spot. The salad that came out first with warm bread was amazing. My favorite was the fried zucchini. I could not stop eating them, everyone felt the same way as well. The spaghetti was out of this world. I never knew spaghetti could be so delicious.  The steak was cooked to perfection, tender, and moist. The portions are huge and can be great for all  size groups. This is a great place for date night or family gatherings.",

All entrees are family style, so our party of 4 ordered 2 entrees and a salad.  It was more than enough!  My favorite is the Chicken Scalloppini.  We had them serve it over angel hair pasta (slight upcharge), and it was phenomenal.  We also had another dish with red sauce, sausage meatballs, and angel hair. (can't remember the name of this entree)  It was excellent as well.  The Carmine's salad is huge, with lots of lettuce, tomatoes, chopped up meats, etc. all tossed in home-made Italian dressing.  If you're in the mood for traditional Italian food, then Carmine's is a great option.  We first ate there in NYC a few years back, and we make sure to visit whenever we're in a city that has one.  I wish they'd open a Carmine's somewhere in the south!!!",

    "text": "I do not reccomend this restaurant for couples. We decided to skip our favorite italian restaurant in Vegas, Wolfgang Pucks Lupo, and give Carmines a try this time. We thought we might be missing out on something really good but it turns out we weren't missing anything at all.   We had a reservation and when we arrived the hostess told us we could not sit in the dining room unless we order from the family style menu. We said we didn't want family style because it was just the two of us and so they told us we could only eat in the bar area. That is total crap and very unprofessional. Our reservation was basically pointless. We were sat at a high top in the bar and given a menu that had half the selection the family style menu had and therefore we couldn't order what we had originally intended because our choices were limited. We were served by the bartender who was not very attentive because he had other patrons at the bar. By the way, their menu items have no descriptions whatsoever. For example, the menu just says \"ravioli.\" Is this cheese filled ravioli? Meat filled ravioli? What kind of sauce comes on it? Do the entrees come with a side salad? Do they come with bread? These are all questions we had to ask. I've never seen such a non-descriptive menu before. We ordered the \"fried zucchini\" and ended up sending it back because it came with no sauce, and was shoestring style. Again, there was no description on the menu so we didn't know what to expect. We would not have ordered if we had known it was shoestring zucchini.   I ordered the cheese ravioli which was drowning in sauce. There was so much sauce left over you could have filled two measuring cups. My husband ordered the bolognese which the cooks screwed up and made the family style portion by mistake (oops! could have eaten in the dining room then!) While they did not charge us for the extra large portion it was a HUGE waste of food because obviously he couldn't finish it all and we had no where to store it in our hotel room.   We could have eaten at Lupo for the same price with better food and service. The only reason we stayed and ordered was because we had a show to catch and didn't have time to go somewhere else. Total crap experience and will never come back.",

    "text": "Carmine's is now a favorite eatery in Vegas. After a day of shopping at The Forum inside Caesar's Palace, I needed something light, but satisfying to eat. I noticed Carmine's \"Happy Hour\" sign in front of the restaurant. Happy Hour at Carmine's?  A no brainier. I went inside with shopping bags in tow. The happy hour menu is offered between 12-5 pm with several food options including a breaded eggplant \"roll\", fried calamari, Parmesan garlic bread,  steamed mussels in tomato sauce and meatball sliders. The drink offerings were one red and one white vino selection, one beer selection, margarita and martini selection. I chose the eggplant and red wine selection, which was, in my opinion, similar to a Cabernet Sauvignon, full-bodied with a peppery finish.   My bartender was so kind, I forgot his name, and very accommodating. The bartender noticed that the server brought me the wrong order, so he immediately had him send it back to the kitchen After glimpse of the food and smelling sheer deliciousness of the \"wrong plate\", I decided I would take it since it was already prepared. By this this time the server was headed to the kitchen. He, the bartender, raced to the kitchen to grab the meal and brought it out to me. I really appreciate the effort. Not only that, the meal was DELICIOUS. I'm glad the server initially brought it out because I never would have been able to experience this awesome dish otherwise. I was very happy.",

She then continued to explain the happy hour specials for both the samplers and drinks. Natalie was extremely professional and informational, but welcoming and friendly, too. She had no problem having friendly conversation with us beyond quick small talk. The food at Carmine's is flavorful, fresh and plentiful!

I chose the meatball wedge- it was $19 and it  came with a small side salad. There was nothing very memorable about the food or the atmosphere. A meatball wedge like this at your local pizza shop cost half that amount. Customer's at tables were dining on platters of pasta, and various other large platters.

It came out looking delicious!  Lobster, mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp...  all over cooked!  It started with the calamari tasting like a rubberband soaked in chum.    Next, I had to saw into the shrimp to cut it in half, to taste the crunch that should be reserved for a Snyder's pretzel, and the vein jamming between molars.  After my wife saw my face chewing like it's cud, she thought to try the lobster... she popped out a dry chewy piece of shredded meat and didn't bother with any more.    I shouldn't need to explain how awful the clams were after the rest of the mess, but I tried a mussel after all this.  For the first time as an adult, I spit partially chewed food onto my plate.  The mussel had the consistency of a sand soaked wash cloth.  I've had gritty seafood before, but someone must've rolled this thing in desert soil right before serving it.  I haven't wanted for a piece of floss like this since $2 steak at Chuck o Rama.  To be fair; they did not make us pay for this atrocity, we did not eat it either, and my appetite was shot.  (Our server did apologize several times and offer us something else)  I haven't felt this close to food poisoned in 20 years and over 100 visits to Vegas.  It got a second star because they cooked the angel hair perfectly.  (Boiled in chum)",

Their Salmon is also great, just keep in mind that it comes served with shellfish so you keep that in mind fi you don't eat shellfish or if you are allergic. They can make it without the clams but you have to request it in advance.  I really do like this place and it's great to know they have 2 locations in NYC as well if I'm ever in the area.

The portions were huge and mediocre for the most part, but a majority of us ended up getting stomach cramps and/or food poisoning after eating here. The service was decent (wait staff) but the bar staff was pretty rude. I don't think I'll be visiting this establishment again.",

Appetizers: fried zucchini strips (amazing), a mixed salad and a roasted pepper and mozzarella salad - all really good. Pasta course - Ravioli with Ragu, Shrimp with angel hair pasta in white sauce - again super yummy. Main course (which by now we did not need) - Veal Marsala and Eggplant parm.  Both super good. Dessert - really????  Tiramisu and fresh fruit.  Not sure how all this works in the dining room but I can say their food is excellent as was their service.  Check it out!",

The bar menu had smaller portions, but this was definetely enough for two plus a lot left to take with you to enjoy. I recommend the blood orange Italian soda, the fried zucchini  and the hearty  Bolognese sauce with your favorite pasta!!!",

We arrived a few minutes a head of our guest and we ordered a class of wine.  The waiter brought the wine and left it.  He did not offer to pour the first glass he just dropped it and left.   The first time we visited this restaurant we ordered the pasta on the side and it wasn't a problem, this time it was.  The waiter insisted that we have the parigiana placed on top of the pasta.  So we did.  No biggie just didn't want it that way.   The first time we were the the waiter was amazing.  Very helpful and offered his opinion when we asked.  This time we were told what was good and I felt that there was a little eye rolling when we did not order the $48.00 special.    Our food was delivered by a runner - no big deal but the waiter did not return to our table until we were at least half finished.  We were not even asked if we wanted ground pepper on our salad.  Our waiter did show up to tell us about dessert but again really just wanted us to order what ever the special was for the night. We declined but did order dessert.  We ordered regular coffee as well.   Around 10:00 (I think) our waiter started his side work - removed our salt and pepper shakers etc.  Did a few other things around our table, refilled our coffee once brought us the bill that my husband paid and then he was gone.  Never told us he was leaving for the evening.  We continued to sit and enjoy our conversation until around 10:45 but no one bothered with us again.   We are locals and have lots and lots of people that come to town to visit us.  After our first wonderful experience we were thinking that this was going to be our go to restaurant.  Not so sure after last nights experience.",

    "text": "Event planning sucks. Earlier this year I had the brilliant idea to bring my sales team to Vegas as part training, part reward trip for the awesome job they've been doing. Little did I realize the number of things that could go wrong when planning a small event.   Most frustrating is that we lost our meeting venue at our hotel.  At the last minute, the hotel event staff sent us a laundry list of restrictions, including no outside food or drinks.   Nothing says \"great job team\" like shoving them in a windowless room for 10 hours with no food and water.    I frantically turned to any local source I could find, and a friend on Facebook recommended Carmine's. I'm not going to lie, we were a little dubious; images of us sitting in a room with whiteboards surrounded by noisy eaters and screaming children came to mind.  Fortunately that was the furthest from the truth.   The atmosphere was perfect. They put us in a quiet room in the back.  Music, air temperature, and lighting were under our complete control.  We used the 40\" ++ flat screen monitor for presentations, and the staff was attentive but not intrusive.    The food was incredible. We ordered a constant stream of appetizers, entrees, and desserts throughout the day.  Some were better than others (as you'd expect) but on the whole we were happily surprised and unanimously agreed that the food was delicious.  Note to self: the garlic bread was amazing, and the Titantic is quite unstable if you eat the bottom crust first.   In short, they made our event easy, literally attended to our every need, and the food and atmosphere made for a very productive day.  And they saved my bacon by accommodating my last minute request for a meeting space ... or more appropriately my \"prosciutto\".  ; )",

    "text": "What a great experience!!!  My husband and I knew about Carmine's in the city, but we've never gotten around to eating there. We took a trip to Vegas and found a Carmine's in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, so we decided to stop in. Great decision!  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, and made sure we had a great experience. Everyone made sure to emphasize that Carmine's serves family-style dinner- no less than 3 people told us. We went with the penne alla vodka, and resisted the idea to order anything else. We were hesitant about the size of the dish, right up until they brought it out. We ordered the junior portion that was available at lunch, and we did not need to eat for pretty much the rest of the day!  It was delicious- perfect seasoning and the vodka sauce was awesome!  Their Montepolciano was wonderful, as well, and my husband was thrilled at being able to have as many sodas as he could handle with no extra charge!  Definitely worth a visit wherever there is one, particularly with a large group!",

Not spectacular, not really good, just good.  The bread they served was weird and cold, and no olive oil.  I think my perception is a little colored because I couldn't drink.  So A-OK definitely describes it... I would go back, but if I were specifically looking for Italian and didn't have a large group, I know I could find better.",

They have a full bar and the drinks are yummy! Very heavy handed bartenders!!!!  the menus are on the walls which is a little different but easy to see from where we sitting. I went with a party of 12 and I made the reservations through yelp which was super easy and awesome!!! When we checked in the table was ready and were seated within 2 minutes of arrival!! The hosts greeted us promptly and checked to make sure our table was set then we were off! The food is served family style so very large portions and if you add pasta to a main dish like the chicken Parmesan it's an extra 12 something but it will feed about 3.5/4 people!! See my pictures we added the angel hair pasta to our chicken Marsala and we did not finish it! We also ordered the stuffed salmon which was the best salmon I have ever had!!!!!! It was pretty pricey but well worth it! Chicken Parmesan was super cheesy and cooked so well! The lasagna was really meaty and had an excellent amount of cheese! Another item I was impressed with was the shrimp scampi!!! The pictures do not do it justice!! The shrimps are almost the size of prawns. I did add a little lemon to the pasta (which we also added on the angel hair pasta) We also has one dish I was not super impressed with but I did not order it and would never have ordered it was a broccoli and pasta dish with a white wine sauce it was pretty bland and nothing too great about it. But everything else was amazing!!!! I can't wait to go back to Vegas just to eat here!!!",

I really love how it was very convenient and inside of the forum shops in the Caesars Palace and how generous their portions were. I myself am not a very big eater but we had a party of 7 and even had a little food to take home. The menu was a giant menu on their wall which was super cool since it was my first time ever seeing that in a restaurant. I thought that the prices were fair for the amount served. We chose 5 dishes all together and the food was good. Some dishes I didn't enjoy as much but other dishes I wanted to keep eating. We ordered the Caesar salad to start, spicy scarpariello wings, penned alla vodka, shrimp scampi, and the carbonara. My favorite was the carbonara and the wings!",

    "text": "My husband and I recently got married at Caesars Palace and we decided to have our reception at Carmines.  This was one of the best decisions we made on multiple levels. 1) We were lucky enough to work with Cassy, the events manager at Carmines.  From the very first encounter with Cassy when she walked us around the venue to her accommodating the ten extra people that ended up joining us for our tasting at a different date to ensuring that everything was exactly as we asked for, she was the consummate professional.  In addition, her candor and the rapport she made with us was much appreciated.  I felt like I was working with a friend and she shared in the joy of our special day while making sure every detail was met. 2) The food.  Oh my, the food.  We had a whole table of hot and cold appetizers.  Everything was delicious and exactly as it was when we had it at our tasting.  The three pastas we chose were a total hit with the guests.  Cassy gave excellent advice about which pastas would hold up in the warmers and she couldn't have been more accurate.   3)  The staff that was on the floor was incredible.  We had servers that ensured the food amounts were always full and replenished quickly.  We had to do a last minute two-top table for my husband and I (we forgot to ask for it in our original plan) and they were able to accommodate us immediately and without an issue.  We had two bartenders that were spot-on and worked their tails off to ensure our guests didn't go thirsty.  Overall, it was the reception I had been wanting and dreaming about and I couldn't have been any happier or satisfied.",

The calamari came out crisp and the sauce for dipping was fantastic. The pasta dish was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so rich and filling I could only eat one serving from it. We didn't opt for the to go box because I know we would over eat. Ugh such a shame to throw out so much delicousness. Bring 4+ people if you want to sit in the main area to dine in. That way you don't have colossal amounts of left over grub.",

When you consider the portion size, the prices are quite reasonable!   The ambiance is that of 1950s Little Italy with a mix of big band and crooner music always keeping the mood chill. The wait staff is attentive and professional, while keeping the environment relaxed and delightful.   The manager Terry and bartenders Natalie, Anthony, Peter, Michael, and Andrew are always on top of keeping our visits special. The happy hour deals are out of this world. The meatball sliders and fried ravioli are our go-to's. I can't imagine a better Italian restaurant in Vegas. This puts \"neighboring\" restaurants with some alliteration and others in the Fashion Show mall to shame! 10/10 will return.",

Surprisingly though, our portion of the clams was pretty tiny and just enough for 2-3 people. However, the ravioli and fettuccine compensated. We were full to the brim with a ton of leftovers even in a group of 5 people. The prices are pretty decent for the quantity of food you get, and it may not be the best Italian food you've had but it is still pretty good. The ambience is super nice and the place is in the heart of Caesars too.",

Everything in the restaurant is served family size (4-6 people) so we opted for bar service where you can order smaller appetizer portions.  Peter was our server/bartender and he could not have been more knowledgeable about the menu.  He was great about directing us in what to order for drinks and food.  Not only was he a great server but he was very friendly and when he found out it was my husband's 50th celebration he was so gracious!  The food came out hot, fast and delicious! We shared a ravioli with ragu sauce and the portion size was perfect for the two of us.  I am not a bread kind of gal, but Carmine's was delicious.

I'm thinking I didn't order the yummy items that everyone else is raving about, but I'm not a beef, pork or lamb eater- chicken and fish are my usual, so with that said, here's my review.   The staff was super friendly and helpful.   We ordered the chicken parmigiana that feeds four people, green salad (that'll feed five people) and a side of (child's portion) vermicelli pasta w/butter and garlic.   Glass of decoy cab wine was very good. The complimentary garlic foccia bread was not good but loved the fresh sour dough. Yum!   It's definitely a family kind of restaurant with no frills. The food is good, not great. The menu had great options to choose from; but frankly I was SUPER surprised they had veal on the menu. I usually don't eat at places where they serve veal due to the way they're treated. They should really consider taking it off the menu. ;(  Not sure I'll be back, lots of other great places to try.",

They give you a ton of food, which is great if you are eating with a lot of people and don't want to spend much. Definitely more Americanized and most dishes are just tons of carbs with sauce and a little bit of protein. I was a little disappointed in their basic spaghetti. Nothing mind blowing. I really enjoyed the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and very fresh. for dessert we ordered the titanic. It was pretty good, the chocolate cake on the bottom was rich and almost the consistency of a truffle, freshly made whipped cream, a few nuts and ice cream.",

    "text": "I've never been to Carmine's in NYC, but we ended up here for dinner when a group of us were in Vegas because nothing sounded better when it came to prepping for a long night than heavy pasta. So we made our way here around 9 PM on a Saturday night (early? late? It depends on your alcohol intake day-to-date), and with a reservation we got seated easily, although even without one, we would have been totally fine. Service was pretty solid, particular in providing us a refill of bread to satiate our appetites while waiting for the rest of the food. As for the Chianti we ordered...there is an extensive wine list here, but it tasted a bit like they are expecting tourists to frequent (aka overpay).  Despite the lowered expectations I had, the food was pretty good here. The bread in olive oil was as expected, but the pasta did what we wanted - filled us solid while being pretty flavorful. The veal parmesan was quite good, even if the meat was dry from being a bit overcooked and subsequently bathed in tomato sauce. The lasagna was a bit better, mainly because it was so dense and prototypically / stereotypically prepared that is was decadent (if a bit soggy). We also had a bolognese dish (with rigatoni, I think?) - very standard and hearty, but not necessarily worth the premium that Carmine's charges for everything on their menu.  The ambiance is nice, if a bit forced and overdone (kind of like everything in the shops at Caesar's Palace) - they go the extra mile to make you feel like you're in an old-time NYC pasta hole in the wall, albeit it with tall ceilings and air conditioning. Nonetheless, the food was admittedly better than I expected, although you should be prepared to pay the tourist price for it. There are worse places to dine in Las Vegas, but there are better options as well, particularly if you expand your view beyond the Strip.",

Then she asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar. This was after she set a couple that were walkins from the mall. I said no I want to table because I made a reservation. Then she got an attitude and seated us next to a pole across from the kitchen. I asked to be move which the manager accommodated. We never got bread until we asked for it. Our drinks were horrible. They're signature salad was the best part of the meal. We shared the lasagna. It tasted like cheesy bread mashed potatoes. I'm not sure it was fully cooked and I couldn't eat it. This was our second visit to the restaurant   within the last two years. The first trip was delicious but I won't be back as the service and food quaintly is decreased. The first time was phenomenal this time it was a waste of $100.",

After wandering for what seemed like hours, I landed here for dinner and sat in the bar, since they serve smaller portions there. My server was so sweet and helped me navigate a few options since I was dining alone. I ended up with a huge side caesar salad and the chicken parmigiana. The caesar was probably one of the best I've ever had. It was so garlicky and delicious. The chicken parm was also on point and bathed in a nice red sauce.   Menu is loaded with all the Italian favorites and each portion is designed to serve 2-3 people. I wish I could've tried more dishes, but I guess that means I'll have to come back with a group!",

    "text": "My experience at Carmine's Las Vegas was absolutely terrible. As a frequent visitor of both locations in NYC, I was expecting fun, good service, yummy drinks and awesome food, however I got the exact opposite.   My friend and I visited around 5:30p on New Year's Eve before the rush so the restaurant was relatively empty. We sat at the bar and immediately were greeted with an attitude by the bartender. When we asked for bread a second time (because he didn't respond or acknowledge us the first time) he barked \"when I get a second\". He never offered us water, served me a watered down drink in a dirty, sticky glass and we had to flag him down (despite the bar being pretty empty given the time) for basic things such as forks and plates. When our entree came, it was ice cold and he suggested we scrape the food off of our plates (please note, my friend and I were sharing a dish as this restaurant is family-style) back into the serving dish so the chef could warm it up instead of preparing us a new dish and apologizing for the inconvenience.   I have to wonder if we were treated this way as the only black and gay couple at the bar because he was completely pleasant with other guests. Additionally, he asked us if we wanted the check TWICE during our visit once before we even ordered food and the second time was before the food we ordered came out ice cold.   I recommend you stay clear of this place and I hope if you do choose to visit, you're treated better than we were.",

First off, our service was exceptional. The waiter was friendly and super helpful.  Since Carmine's is family style we were quite pleased we hadn't eaten all day and were ready to eat for 2 (each)! And we did. We went a classic spaghetti and meatballs, as well as as a Chicken Piccata. Both were delicious. Both were delicious, we were stuffed, and still able to take some leftovers back to our room -- which we needed to soak up the remaining wine they packed up for us from our oversized bottle.   The waiter also brought us complimentary after-dinner drinks that were an unexpected surprise. Definitely worth the trip!",

Things started off great and then took a nose dive after the salad course.   Two pasta dishes and a chicken entree took about 40 minutes to come out. One of the pasta dishes was wrong and had to be redone, took another 30 minutes. We thought we had ordered the chicken saltimbocca  but couldn't find the prosciutto. After asking our server about it he assured us it was there, we just couldn't see it. I'll tell you what, I couldn't taste it either.   Carmines ended up being a disappointment. At least there was a decent gelato stand down the way.",

We started with the calamari.  It was crisply fried and not greasy at all.  Four of us ate the whole platter.  We then split the Porterhouse steak and penne pasta with a rose cream sauce.  The pasta was very good if simple.  The porterhouse was outstanding.  On a cut that size, it is usually tough and difficult to prepare properly.  It was med rare and sliced into thin strips with a little drizzle of garlic butter over the top (butter, no wonder). It was very tender and flavorful. We all commented on how good it was.    Definitely a solid 3 1/2 stars!",

I mean the decor was very neat. I'm a total food, wine, hospitality junkie and I had never seen a wine rack so tall! The photos on the walls were authentic and really told a story about the place. We were greeted by a nicely dressed host who welcomed us with a warm smile and brought us over to our table. A few moments later, our waiter Frank introduced himself. He had a ton of knowledge and answered every question we had about the mouth watering menu. Frank was the ideal waiter to have, at my first time at Carmine's. we were lucky to have gotten there a little bit after lunch time because we were able to  order from the lunch menu, which had smaller portions, which were still big! We ended up getting garlic bread, half with cheese. Which I thought was cool. Most places don't offer you the option. And then we shared a lunch size Penne Ala Vodka. And we still had left overs!!! Perfect Italian cooked pasta. None of that over cooked mushy shit. The food was excellent. The place was organized and beautiful. The bathrooms were clean. And the service was awesome. Our waiter was friendly and fun to talk to! Although he did tell us he was a Raiders fan. Ha ha. Recommending Carmine's to everyone I know! I also can't wait to dine at the NYC and DC locations! High expectations! Keep up the good work and hospitality, Vegas!",

We live in NYC, and have eaten in Carmine's in NYC, several times. This is the first time we have eaten here in Carmine's in Vegas, it just opened Fall 2013.    The penne with Bolognese sauce, meatballs and manicotti were magnificent.  For our appetizer, we ordered Spiedini Alla Romana, pure heaven.   And for the grand finale, the Titanic!!  A huge replica of the ship made out of chocolate fudge, bananas, pineapples, strawberries, real cream and chocolate shavings; not to mention, the three Italian rolled cookies, Pirouettes,  shaped into smoke stacks with candles emerging from each stake.Soooo Gorgeous to eat!!! Outstanding display of food beauty, not to mention the charm and efficiency of the wait staff.  Our waiter, Mr. Baker, sang and danced for us (formerly a performer), now a church choir singer and coordinator.  He made the night extra special with his talent and charm.  Yes, the portions are humongous!! One portion for a least 3-4 persons, and the Titanic dessert serves at least 4-5 persons, and that is still too much. The next time you visit Vegas, take a trip to Caesar's and enjoy the epicurean delights at Carmine's!!",

Meatballs were moist with just a hint of garlic and cheese. Mama would be proud. Highlight of an already fantastic meal was the scampi. Not the butter and garlic drenched monstrosity served elsewhere. These were succulent shrimp seemingly baked in garlic, butter, white wine and parsley, with a seasoned bread crumb crust.

    "text": "I've been to so many restaurants in Vegas over the last 15 years, I can't keep track.  This to me by far is the best Italian restaurant, and it was surprisingly reasonably priced.  I reserved a table for 6.  The server was very informative, and let us know that 2 or 3 family style plates will be enough to feed our whole table.   Being that I'm 6'3\" and 205 lbs with a big appetite, and I happened to be the smallest guy at the table, I was skeptical.  When we ordered a Caesar salad which fed all 6 of us, then started to order 3 plates, he stopped me after ordering 2, and said \"That will be enough\".  Sure enough it was.  The portions are huge, which in my past experience means the food is mediocre, but not here.  The food tasted amazing.  We had lasagna, and Chicken Scaloppine w/ lemon & butter, and I'd order both again.   For 6 people, which included 2 dinner plates, 1 salad plate, 1 mixed drink, and 4 glasses of wine, the tab was $180.  Not bad at all to fill us up with great tasting food. Nobody had an appetite when we finished there.",

My girlfriend and I shared and we still had a lot of food to take home.  Definitely family style portions. And the waiter was very informative with the menu because I was ready to order three things. The food was very good. I'll repeat again and again and again. Total cost was $54 after (soft)drinks and tip. Very happy with this dinner selection.",

I loved the ambience, great music and a family feel. I really did feel like I was dining in an old school New York Italian restaurant amongst good company.  We arrived Friday night with a large group and we came ready to eat.  Carmine's had us covered; their portions are HUGE!  My favorites were the cold antipasto, fried zucchini, and porterhouses contadina. Everything is cooked to perfection and the servers really do treat you like family. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for those in search of great Italian food.  I'll definitely be back to try their calamari and spaghetti with meatballs.",

Seated at a table towards the front, we could watch the hotel guests pass by and wish they were eating inside with us.  Great Italian menu!  The meatball was delicious as an appetizer!  We enjoyed the chicken parmesan with rigatoni family style as our entree.  Dessert?  The Tiramisu is gigantic like a pie and heavenly.  Our eyes did catch our neighboring table celebrating a birthday with The Titanic dessert!  Now, that was enormous and a work of art.  We may even decide to stay at Caesar's next time so we can frequent Carmines several times.  Thanks Antonella!",

The restaurant is traditionally southern Italian family style so the servings are served just as you were to be at home with your family on a Sunday evening.  We ordered the scarp wings with a delicious butter lemon rosemary sauce (omg definitely did not expect them to be this delicious!), hot antipasto (what a great deal for a sampler), large shrimp cocktail (these shrimp were the biggest shrimp I've ever seen!!) and for our main course we ordered a few pastas and entrees.  The pomodoro with spaghetti and prosciutto is to die for! Super fresh with large plum tomatoes with just enough spice to set it apart from the traditional red sauce.  Also the garlic and oil with ravioli is to die for, cheese heaven!!  For the cherry on top, Marcus provided us with the best service!  Answered each of our questions with absolute certainty and passion that had us at the edge of our seat anticipating the next course with excitement. Water bottle service, wine service, fresh new plates between each course and great suggestions for each plate.  Thank you for the endless amount of smiles and jokes throughout service!   This dining experience has truly been remarkable and I will definitely be back and telling my friends about it along the way!   Cheers for a great job well done guys.",

    "text": "My wife and I were on our way to another bar/restaurant in the Forum Shops when we walked past this place and made a mental note to come back and try it sometime. It just looked inviting.  Turns out we got our chance sooner than expected when our plans at the other restaurant did not go entirely as planned. We had show tickets at 7:30 and had sat at a table at the other place from 5:30 to 6:15 without getting served so much as drinks, so we politely took our leave and ran back to Carmine's. Could they possibly accommodate us and get us to the show on time with such short notice?   We were seated straight away with no wait. When we explained our situation to our server, Ryan, he had our cocktails out within 5 minutes. Once we'd decided on our dinner items he talked to his manager and they bumped up our service order and had our entrees out about 5 minutes after that. We couldn't believe it! When they brought it to us we actually said \"that can't be ours\".   Did getting it so quickly impact the quality of the dish at all? If it did, then they should be charging more, because everything was fantastic. For drinks I had the Espresso Martini which was just spot on and my wife had the Sicilian Mule, which was somehow actually even better. We ordered Angel Hair Pomodoro and Veal Saltimboca for our entrees, which was way too much food for two people, but we ate every last scrap of it anyway because it was amazing. Oh, and we ate most of the bread basket too because how else were we going to sop up all of that delicious sauce that the Veal Saltimbocca was covered in?   Head to toe, beginning to end, Carmine's impressed the heck out of us. Not only will we be back, we'll be back with friends.",

Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.    My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!  The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.       Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were \"tender as fuck\".  I agreed.    The main event was the \"Four Pasta Special\" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.  My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.",

I highly recommend the Italian ice drinks from the bar and the Penne alla Vodka. However, the women's restroom was in poor condition. It was not clean, one of the sinks was clogged and had standing water. The toilets were dirty, and majority of the  soap dispensers were empty. Now keep in mind this was a Saturday night at 7, at their busiest hours. If the women's restroom was this unsatisfactory I can only imagine what the men's looked like.  In all I would say this is an amazing place to eat, but the cleanliness was poor.",

Meatball sliders are OUTSTANDING, garlic bread was delicious as well. The Italian sandwich had lots of flavor. Came in for a small bite but got tons of food, everything looked good and we kept hearing great things about this place. Will be back!",

    "text": "So talk about catering to a BIG party. It was over my nephew Vegas Cup soccer tournament weekend. The team wanted team dinner before the tournament started for team bounding but also just so the kids all be together. My nephew mom was in charge of finding the restaurant. She decided Carmine would be great spot! It very similar to Buca De Beppa the whole family style concept and really perfect for bunch of kids. It was my first time dining at Carmine's. Truth be told not much difference between the two from the concept or the food. I think both are very good italian food. They do your basics well from chicken parmesan, spaghetti with meatballs, caesar salad, and on on. On this night had preset menu started with caesar salad that was good. Nothing that blew me away but solid refreshing salad start. The spaghetti and meatballs good. The meatballs were decent size not over the top size but nice juicy, cooked on point, and tasty. The tomato sauce could have sue more flavor in my opinion. Still overall good pasta course. The chicken parmesan was good. It have nice crust on the outside . The tomato sauce brought it all together. The dessert if there was anything food stood was the dessert course. It was modified strawberry shortcake. Instead of pound cake they used more banana bread. The fresh strawberry not skimpy about and the sauce brought it all together. Talk about finishing meal on high note.  SHOUT OUT that well deserve Catherine not sure if she in charge of parties or her role in the restaurant. She was the main person dealt with setting up BIG party as in over 40people. Number that was constantly changing at the last minute adding more since some families not sure if make flight in on time or what not. Each time called the restaurant it was never big deal and she was more happy change it. Not sure if it was timing but they opened up back (talk about deceiving but keep walking back back back separate dining area for parties) area since we had over 40people. It was awesome for the kids that they had extra space. It not as loud so everyone could talk stories and just relax enjoy before the tournament. Catherine came out when we first got sat make sure everything was good, and very grateful brought big group into the restaurant. Our server she did amazing job also sorry not remember her name. Big parties it chaos comes to bill. She did great job and deserve shout out. The service was FIVE stars without doubt.   Yes first review without pic! =(((( They should add that to firsts on Yelp. LOL!!!",

The manager came to our table and said it was a crab, it's fresh seafood and that happens once in a while. Hmmm I was so grossed out i totally lost my appetite. I don't think I'll eat mussels ever again. I feel the manager could/should have done more.",

The typical plate feeds 4-5 people. They do have a small bar menu but I found that it was a little bit limited.   We will definitely be back on our next trip!",

Unlike most restaurants, Carmine's serves food family style so each dish is a huge portion that can serve multiple people. There were 11 of us and we had for appetizers: salad, wings, and calamari. For dinner we had, the stuffed fish special, veal, pasta bolognese, pasta alla vodka.  All of the food was absolutely fantastic and we were beyond stuffed at the end (and even had leftovers). If you are a lover of garlic this is the place for you, they use a healthy amount in each dish. I would recommend the wings for an appetizer. They are garlicky and delicious. If you are going to choose any entree, it must be the bolognese. It was one of the best I have had and is quite filling.  The sticker shock of each dish can seem daunting but if ordering as a group, you can most likely get away spending less per person than most restaurants in Vegas due to the portion size.   I wish they had one close to me since I would definitely go. I highly recommend it if you are traveling with a small or large group in Vegas.",

    "text": "Better bring a ton of people and your stomachs to Carmine's!  This is in my opinion the best \"Family Style\" Italian restaurant I have been to.  The atmosphere has that home old school Italian feel, and right when you walk in you get hit with all the good Italian aromas.  The food is all family style and each item can literally feed at least 2 people.  To start you have to get the Cold Antipasto.  When this thing came out is was like a 2 foot long plate covered in meat, cheese, and bread.  Once that is done start running down the menu.  For the beef The Rack of Lamb would be a great choice which is a house specialty was super tender, juicy and melt in your mouth goodness.  Next if you want to go off the menu you can get the Carbonara for a pasta.  The Carbonara noodles were cooked perfectly they you get the creaminess of the sauce with the saltiness of the Pancetta.  One word Phenomenal.  Then if you want to go with an Italian staple you have to get the Lasagna.  The lasagna is doused in tomato sauce with the right amount of meat and cheese.  This this was dense and will fill you up fast!  If you have enough room for dessert you can never go wrong with the Cannoli's, but for some odd reason you are not human and still can eat a horse you have to get the TITANIC.  The TITANIC is literally the size of the actual ship.  It is The Titanic at Carmine's is a gigantic sundae made with six whopping scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, caramelized fruit, hot fudge sauce and an entire Chocolate Torta.  Overall, the food is amazing the service is good but sometimes it will be awhile before the waiter checks on you which is the reason why Carmine's is down to 4 stars but whenever I am in Vegas I always visit Carmine's.

The place was packed but we were seated immediately. Our server Natalie was right on top of things. She wasted no time getting our drink and appetizer orders. Carmine's is a family style restaurant so the portions are HUGE. I had the Penne ala Vodka. Oh man....was it delicious.Truly the best sauce ever.My husband had the ravioli. He said it was wonderful. We both ate more than we usually do.We asked for a basket of bread which had various types/flavors of bread. I really liked the fennel bread. Fresh and full of flavor.  We had enough leftover for the next day. And it was just as good! A lively and loud place but  so worth it. We are locals and will go back.",

Wish it was nice a warm from the oven like we prefer. We decide to return the next day for another great experience bad idea .The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 5 star is because my second visit was not great  the waiter was horrible on October 10th . We waited forever for him to come say hello never gave us his name . We left without ordering because he just ignored us. I didn't want to bother, the sad part the girl at the front hostess di dnt even notice we just came and left 20 minutes later. I will give them a 3rd chance and speak up next time if I receive the same service.",

The food was far from good and the restaurant was overpriced for what it was. I was served overly salty plates, burnt broccolis and overcooked pastas. The price made it that much worst, as I had much better food for a lot less on that trip (come on... It's Vegas! There is good food in that city). My one star goes to the service, that was pretty decent.  If you are looking for good food in Vegas, skip on that one.",

    "text": "Carmine's in the Caesar's Palace Forum Shoppes is a terrific evening for you and friends, couples and such.  It epitomizes Italian cuisine served in family portions.  The ambiance is unique, friendly, kinda sexy/cozy and well worth a night of dining.     While with 7 other friends we went without a reservation on a Friday night (8:00PM) and were seated in under 10 minutes.   Drinks came quickly after a great server gave us a rundown of specials, one of which we ordered (read on).     Ours was a semi-business dinner so as drinks were being served we were going around the table in discussion.  Soon after I was provided a second drink service by the manager with the server saying, \"Our manager didn't believe you were having a good time by the non-passionate look on your face.  Enjoy.\"  Now readers, when was the last time that ever happened to you in a nice restaurant.  Carmine's went way up the charts for me on that one.      We dined on a special which was breaded chicken filets covered in provolone cheese coupled with pasta.  Another entree was lasagna.  The third was a fettucini in a white veggie-based sauce.  Each meal was delicious, huge portions that would easily feed 3 - 4 people dining.  And the total bill was manageable for 8 guys.      I highly recommend anyone in Vegas pay a visit to Carmine's - big time good food and fun times.",

I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't have food menus but had drink menus instead?!   To order our food, we had to take a picture of the menu board on my phone. Then go back to the table to order. Most plates on the menu averaged between $20-$30 which I was ok with since the servings were big. I normally ask waiters for suggestions at new places. The waiter, (not friendly) tall Hispanic guy with black glasses, suggested a seafood plate bc it was great (according to him). I took his word for it. At the time of the bill, that dish was $70!!!!!!! After reviewing the \"menu board\" I had taken a picture of on my phone, that dish was not on the menu!! What was supposed to be a nice dinner turned out to be a horrible one instead. I felt mislead by the waiter. Why would he suggest something that wasn't on the menu or even mention the price? If I had had a menu on my hands like you would at most restaurants, I wouldn't have ordered that dish. I felt he was trying to add to the bill to increase his tip percentage. Not only that, but the seafood made me sick with food poisoning.   I will never recommend this place to anyone. I did tell all my close friends about the bad experience I had and now I'm sharing it on yelp to warn others who plan to have group dinners here. Worst experience, bad food and I didn't appreciate getting screwed over by the waiter. They need to have menus like all other restaurants do. Only reason I'm giving them one star, is simply bc I have to.",

Which is perfect for two people! We ordered the Penne Al Vodka and it was delish. The sauce was felt homemade and the pasta was cooked al dente.   They even give you a pretty good bread basket with assorted breads to eat from.   I didn't really like our server that was the bartender. He wasn't very inviting and kept trying to push the large pasta to us when you know we won't finish it.

I had never eaten here, just had drinks at the bar and decided to give the food a try. We sat at the high tops in the bar. The waiter never brought us bread, forgot to bring our salad and our entree was barely warm. Got the salad after the entree and had to ask for the bread. Never offered us a drink refill or did anything for the inconvenience other than \"sorry about that.\" Eon't eat here again.",

    "text": "Carmine's offers their food in the family-style.  Most of their dishes are so huge that they could feed two people.  Their prices seem to add that notion in there because it is expensive and not worth the price if you were ordering a meal and appetizer per person.  Sharing, maybe; individual, no way.  We were here for a party so they had dishes prepared for us and they were passed around the table.  Therefore, we tried many different dishes so I was able to experience a lot of their dishes.  We began with calamari, mushrooms, and salad.  The calamari was very good and cooked perfectly but the others were not worth mentioning.  The main meal consisted of a few types of pasta and some meat accompaniments. I did not think any were exceptional or worth mentioning either.  The sauce was solid on the spaghetti, however.    The atmosphere at the restaurant, located in the Forum Shoppes, was nice, but the food underwhelmed unless the only reason you are coming here is to have leftovers for the next day, also.",

    "text": "So to start, the ambience of the restaurant is lovely. This place is HUGE, so the large portions and ample seating is great for parties. Our waitress was a little spacey, and I would say her performance was a little less than average. We started with drinks, and she definitely poured my sister's Hoegaarden poorly, but I guess it's not too big of a deal. The bread basket given contains a mini variety, but unfortunately both baskets had really cold bread. Some were topped with cheese, so it would've been nice to have had it warmed at least instead of it feeling like it came from the fridge. We ordered Carmine's salad ($22.95), mix seafood pasta (I forgot, sorry!), and chicken parmigiana ($34.95). The salad was good, and the portion was more than enough for our party of 7. I was really disappointed with our main dishes. Both the seafood and the chicken were just extremely bland and dry. We ordered our pasta with white sauce (choice of red and white), but it was just flavorless! I really expected more. Even the chicken parmigiana was tasteless.   Overall - I miiiight give this place another chance, but it's not likely. It might have been the food we ordered, but I was not impressed at all with our dinner. I would rate it 2.5 stars if I could.",

    "text": "First let me start by saying there's so much more that goes into a yelp rating besides the food. The food at Carmine's is okay...not the best Italian but it's a decent option inside the Forum Shops.   Now, the reason I gave them 1 star is for service in the restaurant and management's lack of caring about their guest's experience. I'm more willing to understand so so service if the restaurant is packed and you can tell the waiter/waitress is working their butt off. However, this was not the case.   I had lunch here during the week and there were only about 5 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. (This place is huge!!) I was surprised by how slow the waitress was to check on us and even get refills. Now my biggest complaint was when I asked how long their strawberry shortcake would take to make (since I was on a lunch break) and she said 5-7 minutes. Okay, 7 minutes...that's fine. It actually took 20 minutes and the waitress was no where to be found in the meantime. When she finally came around, I asked for it in two boxes to go...so my friend and I could take it with us for later. We waited another 10 minutes and had to speak with a manager. Besides being late, the worst part....later on when I went to enjoy my dessert, I was shocked to find that my box contained whipped cream and strawberries, and later found out my friend's box had the shortcake. Hmm. I asked the waitress for two boxes so we could each take one home...and this is what we were given. :(   Obviously, I was upset so I called in to speak with a manager, I was told to leave a message and no one ever got back to me.",

The restaurant itself is large and can easily accommodate a group of any size.  Don't expect your server to bring you a menu as their menus are posted up on the wall all around the dining room.  There you will also find what the current daily special is.    Your server will bring out a basket of bread and, while you may be tempted to snack on it while waiting for your meal, do so at your own risk!  As I stated above, they offer \"family portions\" (ie: large portions) and that is a gross understatement.  We are talking pounds and pounds of pasta and food.  Yum.  We got three plates to split between the five of us and suffice it to say, we had plenty to take home.  The ravioli was incredible, I mean, it was easily our favorite thing we ordered, so do yourself a favor and get it.  You're welcome.    Our server was fast and tentative and even asked if we were sure we wanted to order three items (we told him we live dangerously).  They also take reservations so feel free to add this to your planning itinerary.  Carmine's acted as a last supper of sorts our last trip to Las Vegas, and I must say, it was a perfect ending to a perfect week.",

The food is served family style and therefore the portions are huge and great for sharing or for having the next day for lunch. It's pricey, but what isn't in Vegas for a good meal? For instance, if you would like a salad or a vegetable to accompany your meal, the Caesar salad (which is enough for 5 or 6 people) costs $29 and some steamed broccoli, served in a huge bowl is $17, again, enough for multiple people to share.  My biggest problem with our dinner last night was the service. DAVID was our server and although he was polite, he was not enthusiastic and didn't want to spend one extra minute at our table helping to answer our questions. Maybe he was having a bad night, but when you're out in Vegas and are about to spend $150 for 2 people to eat dinner, you'd like to think your waiter would be personable and seem happy you are there. I'm not sure if I would go back because of the service; however, the quality of the food might make me reconsider.",

My dad and I ordered the rigatoni with the red sauce. At first when I saw the portion size I thought oh I'm going to scarf that down so fast- but the sauce is soooo rich and sweet that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would. Overall nice place and genuine staff.",

    "text": "Quick look: NYC's famed Carmines in the center on the Forum Shops Mall delivers  traditional Italian fare in MASSIVE family type portions. Couples / single diners beware - this is a lot of food and I suggest groups of 4 or more for ideal proportions.   In depth review: being from NY we were well aware of the Carmine's reputation. Was excited to FINALLY get a chance to try their fare here in Vegas. Ate there this past Monday night and the massive space was pretty full at 7pm for dinner. Nice casual setting with high ceilings, a freakishly large bar with flat screens showing the football game and large menu boards and classic Italian pics decorating the walls. Felt very warm and comfortable even though the room was gargantuan and located in a busy mall.   Server was a nice Serbian fella and he was very attentive. Made some good suggestions and explained the portions and the menu. We kept it simple and ordered a mixed drink, a glass of wine, calamari appetizer and the veal parmesan with penne pasta. The calamari priced at $17 was the largest portion I have ever seen. Was a mountain of fried squid and way too much for two people. It was good, breaded well and not too greasy. We almost filled up on this and had to stop ourselves. The bread was also very tasty!  The veal parmesan came out with perfect timing after the appetizer. The serving dish was piled 4 inches high with penne pasta and it included two giant slabs of veal parm on the top. Wife and I looked at each other in disbelief at how large this dish was. The waiter served us and we started to eat. It was very tasty and the veal was prepared perfectly. The red sauce was also delicious and was glad to see that they did not use sugar when preparing it. We ate till we couldn't eat any more and we had a lot to take home with us in doggy-bags. Was it the best I have ever had, no. But it was certainly one of the better traditional veal parm dishes in the city.   It's a lot of food. Too much for less than four people. We actually had enough for two more additional meals!!  My advice would be to add a \"couples menu\" to their menu. Many couples go out in Vegas. It's a different market and I feel like the large, massive portions alienate couples who want to eat there. Who would want to carry doggy-bags around with them on the mall and on the all night? A lot of people do not have refrigerators in their hotel rooms as well. Price for two of us was about $130. So the pricing is not exactly cheap.   Was a solid meal and w/o a smaller, couples menu - I will only return when I have family or friends in town and they want to eat traditional \"red sauce\" Italian.  I have also had lunch here - the submarine sandwiches are also MASSIVE! I had an Italian mixed and a tomato and mozzarella sandwich and both were tasty and well made. The bread is super fresh and they don't hold back on the meat. Two people can split one and have more than enough.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here after a show.  We weren't hungry enough for a whole dinner, but wanted an appetizer or desert.  We ended up getting the stuffed mushrooms and chocolate cake.  The place has a nice ambiance.  Our server was very nice.  He did disappear for LOONGG periods of time, and we spent a fair amount of time waiting.  (The restaurant was empty.)  But he was very courteous and friendly other than that.  The food was not great.  I love stuffed mushrooms, but I was not impressed with these.  The stuffing had a mushy, porridge-like texture.  It was kind of gross.  After one bite, I scooped most of the stuffing out and just ate the mushrooms themselves.  The word \"goop\" sums up the stuffing, and that's not a word you want to use with stuffed mushrooms.  The chocolate cake was quite good, but very rich, and my wife and I could only handle a few bites.  I have no problem with having a rich dessert that you can't eat a lot of, provided they bring you a portion size that reflects the fact that you can't eat more than a few bits.  But this was an enormous piece of cake, and a price to match.  That doesn't work if the cake is so rich that you can only stand to eat a few bites.  For goopy stuffed mushrooms, a large piece of super-rich cake, and two cokes, we spent about $60.  The food (especially the goopy stuffing on the mushrooms) was not good enough to make us return; the price makes it a \"definitely won't be back.\"",

We were seated about 30 minutes after our originally scheduled reservation which was a little bit off-putting, but we were greeted warmly by a waiter as soon as we were seated.  We ordered several salads and fried calamari, all of which were tasty. We also ordered several pasta dishes, none of which were that impressive in my opinion, with the exception of the meatballs which were pretty delicious.  I tried a couple of their blended drinks and was very underwhelmed and disappointed, especially since this a restaurant located in Vegas.  Overall, the portions are big, the prices are high and the food is decent, but nothing to write home about.",

Transplanting the Carmines of NY / Atlantic City to the Vegas strip would be a challenge as so many cookie cutter type places exist and so many high end unique places open satelite places and fail.  Carmines delivers all of the expecations.  Large long bar and huge seating area adorne this Italian retro look with huge billboards showing the family styple type offerings.  After a drink with the ever pleasant Nicole at the bar we sit 9 for dinner tonight.   Bread is presented which is OK and wine list is perused.  Really a fairly weak wine list to be honest but a couple of value $50.00 Italian and Sicilian bottles are located and were off and running.  Note glasses are like my grandfather used to use and if you watch the scene in the Godfather where The Don is talkling to Michael with a heart to heart you will notice the glasses used are the same here.  Nice touch though I doubt many will remember.  Asked for some recomendations and we are offered a special Cold Antipasto and Hot Antipasto.  The cold was a mix of Italian Cold cuts / Procuitto, olives, eggplant salad, salmon on mozerrela bread etc.  This was fair nothing to write home about at $37.00.   The Hot Antipasto was a Small Calzone, stuffed bread, stuffed mushrooms, ground sausange and brocoli Rabbe, Clams Oregenato, Mussels in red sauce, and a few other things.  This was again OK but the Mushrooms were absolutely to die for So much so that we ordered a separate platter of stuffed mushrooms, a platter of meatballs and a very good Italian Mozerella and parmagina baked bread to complete the appetizers.   all and all Meatballs, Mushrooms and bread top scores.  We take a break here to see how much more we should order as we have hit it pretty good right now but on we go.  Platter of Chicken Marsala, Platter of Veal Parm, Platter of Shrimp Fra Diablo and platter of linquini bolognese with extra side of Bolognese sauce.     Veal Parm a near perfect 10... Delicious, chicken Marsala good but not my favorite, the Shrimp were absolutely incredible clean tasty perfectly cooked while the hot sauce was just the right amount of spicy and declicious as well.  Didn't need the 3bls of pasta in Red Sunday Bolognese Gravy but have to say it was dam outstanding.   NO coffee or deserts tried as we can't walk at this time but 9 guys 4 bottles of wine tax and Tip (Not included automatically) we walked out for $630.00   As far as I'm concerened a tremendous value and really for the most part tremendous presentations and food and taste.  Service was spot on all night and would not in any way hesitate to return here in the future.  Big Thumbs up handling 9 Hungry Hombres. Congratulations forum shops think you found one to stay awhile.",

We had a fixed r ate of 35 pp which is very inexpensive for vegas.  I did not have great expectations for the food.  We got there an hour earlier than our reservation as our meeting ended early.   They could not accommodate us earlier.   Not because of space  but more wait staff.  We got seated exactly when we were supposed  to.  We all got our own drinks from the upstairs bar, there was not drink service for our  group.  I had ice tea, no charge and very good. An assortment of bread  was brought to the table.  No butter, no oil or vinegar.  We were famished and plowed through the bread.  This is a family style restaurant and that was kind of neat.  2 salads, ceaser and house chopped both very good with generous portions.  At some point they brought oil and vinegar for the  bread but no plates and by then most of the bread was gone.  Dinner came, 3 choices of pasta, chicken  and aalmon.  I could not repeat the Italian names of the dishes- we were  all looking words up on our phones.  It was comical.   So the food was amazingly good, almost  perfect.  Not much for service. If you have a large group on a budget this was very good.",

The place is loud and fun, so it's not the best spot to catch up with old friends. The pasta is cooked al dente and the pairing of the bread, along with a bottle of red wine and ending with dessert was just an okay meal for me. I wasn't too fond of the lady fingers, even though it was made in-house. I felt like my food got cold way too quickly too.  3-stars for the food, but a whopping 5-stars for the excellent service we received. I can't remember our server's name, but he was good.",

We had the very popular spaghetti and meatballs and our pasta was still raw it wasn't cooked thoroughly and still hard and the sauce didn't really have an flavor. The bread they give you is really good however the spaghetti wasn't a hit for me. It's pretty pricey as well but if your coming with a big family the price and portions work out well. Our waiter was very quick to attend to our needs. Also me and my bf are pretty tall and have long legs and they tried to put us at a small table and when I requested a bigger one they said we couldn't because there was other reservations with bigger parties. That's really stupid because I made a reservation for a reason and you would think they would be willing to accommodate better.",

    "text": "This place has a great concept but lack the flavor. We started off with a giant Caesar salad which was the tastiest part of the meal. And by tasty, I mean it's super garlicy.  We ordered penne ala vodka which was a box pasta with a sauce that store bought Classico vodka sauce puts to shame. It was so bland, I put chili pepper on it to add some kind of taste & even that wasn't working. The pasta wasn't even al dente. It was nearly crunchy & it took forever to get this super basic part of the meal.  I was truly hoping for this to be good. I was starving, the bar to succeed was low.  The servings are giant but what does it matter if you feel so let down by the quality? This was one of the \"favorites\" on the menu as well.  The service was fine. The restroom was dirty. Toilet paper all over one of the stalls in the women's room.  I just can't recommend this place overall.",

    "text": "How Management Handles Obnoxious Guests - In my opinion, your total dining experience is 50% quality of food and 50% ambience and service. Restaurant managers are accountable for 100% of that and Manny, the MOD tonight, was not taking responsibility for the latter. Our party of 4 was seated next to an obnoxious party of 20 seated at one table. The entire experience took a dive listening to these obnoxiously, overly-joyous (putting it mildly) group hollering and competing for each other's attention with their jokes. Other guests were just annoyed and were joining us with their look of disgust. I approached Manny with my complaint and his offer was to move us to the upper level. It wasn't going to solve the noise problem as it was directly above the source. Wait! Who was being inconvenienced here? My expectation was for Manny to approach the group and respectfully and kindly ask the large group to maintain some decorum as they were not in a private room but in a room full of other guests who are trying to enjoy their dining experience. Our server was so embarrassed and felt helpless. No support from management and it put him in an uncomfortable position. Manny, you left your staff to fend from themselves. Be there for them! It affects their tips and affects their morale. Our receipt showed a portion of our meal had been \"comped\". Too late...our total dining experience was already affected. :-(",

Carmine's serves family style so big portions with enough food to serve well...a family. We had the cold antipasto appetizer which came with seafood pasta, olives, prosciutto and bread. It was all awesome and fresh. Spaghetti and meat balls was the main along with gluten free shrimp fra diavolo. Both were beautifully presented and tasted fantastic. We didn't do desert because the portions were so large, we were quite full. I have to add that the service was phenomenal and it was very helpful to have a server who knew the menu front and back and could answer questions about it in detail. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "The food just wasn't very good. I shared a lasagna with a friend. It was just lacking in flavor. The sauce felt very bland to me. So did the meat. It could have used some more salt, maybe some spice, overall just more flavor. I also thought that the noodles were too soft. Mushy would be an exaggeration, but they definitely felt soft to me.  One pet peeve of mine is when nice Italian restaurants don't use fresh ingredients. I like to cook Italian food at home and sometimes I splurge and get fresh pasta instead of dry pasta, fresh mozzarella instead of the normal kind, good olive oil, and San Marzano tomatoes instead of the store brand. I can definitely notice a difference in taste with the better quality, more expensive ingredients, and I don't think that Carmines uses those ingredients. There definitely wasn't fresh mozzarella, I'm pretty sure that the pasta wasn't fresh, and the olive oil didn't have any flavor to it and just didn't seem high quality. If I'm going to be paying $$$, I want the good stuff.  I was pretty happy with the price and amount of food actually. Dishes are $30-40, but they feed multiple people. The waiter said that the lasagna feeds 3-4 people, but I think that that is a pretty big stretch. My friend and I had the lasagna and a ton of bread, and we both felt satisfied, but definitely not full after the meal.",

Liked the vibe of the place with such eclectic chandeliers, we got the spritz, zucchini fries and eggplant appetizer for happy hour. I believe since the spritz was happy hour priced it had soda instead of prosecco ,but still tasty. The eggplant appetizer was amazing - I could eat more. Zucchini fries were good but the quantity was a lot for 2 people and it didn't come with a dipping sauce which would have elevated it tremendously.  The restaurant is HUGE , can seat hundreds of people. We saw many  large groups enjoying a meal .",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed. I'm from New York, so we know Carmine's well. We've been to the restaurant chain several times however this Ceasars Palace location doesn't live up to the service as the original. Here's my story:  On vacation, we booked a late dinner. We were seated at 1030. If the restaurant doesn't want to treat the customer that is seated at 1030, as they would treat the customer seated at 5pm, they shouldn't seat so late.  Firstly we order a bottle of wine and an appetizer. Prior to, my wife and I were discussing what our entree would be (in the presence of the waitress) though we never actually ordered it. The appetizer came out and then (prior to even having a bite from the appetizer), the 70+ dollar entree comes out. So now, we are meant to eat our appetizer and have our enteee get cold. This is a big no no in the service industry and should especially be followed by a higher class hotel and a higher class restaurant.   On top of this, the bread they brought us was ice cold (not hot, not warm). Lastly, with all our food on the table and before we started eating our entree, that waitress asks us if we will be having desert.   I get that we seated later in the day and the restaurant was set to close at 11, but the restaurant shouldn't seat people this late if they are going to rush them and give them heartburn so they can close on time. There were other people around, still eating. It was completely uncalled for.  1. Waitress should have waited for us to actually order the entree and not assume that's what we wanted  2. She shouldn't have told the kitchen to start preparing it  3. The bread shouldn't have been ice cold 4. Don't ask me if I was desert before I've even started my meal, how am I supposed to know  This was a big let down for me. Management has to change or people are going to get upset. Carmine's in New York and even New Jersey in Atlantic City are busy from open till close. This Carmine's was pretty empty, and I can see why.",

They even have a few items non-Italian like their spinach dip which is hands down the BEST I've ever tasted.  If you like a nice Italian  red wine, you have to have their house Montepulciano because it's out of this world, with a nice fruit forward balanced with a dry but not woody finish.

You won't go home hungry and -- while it ain't cheap -- it's downright affordable by Vegas strip standards.

The wait was shocked when we ordered calamari (yummy!) AND he 3 lb porterhouse w peppers and onions RARE. Not sure why he was so excited by that but that's how my husband and I like out steak. The steak was beautiful tbh and tasted even better. Only complaint, I would ask for all red peppers instead of green and red. Otherwise, amazing! Next time maybe we'll try the porterhouse contadina. I don't like sausage but I'd be interested in trying theirs. We didn't get dessert bc they are huge and for sharing. Will def be back.",

The bread that comes to the table is fresh and warm. We like to get oil and vinegar to dip but the always bring butter too. The meatballs with rigatoni is our go to fave. The house antipasto salad should never be missed. It's amazing. The cheesecake and cappuccino are the perfect end to this meal.  Service here is not as good as NY hence the 4 star but maybe our server was having a rough night. It happens. Will definitely be back every time we are in LV",

I started off with a rum runner which came in an individual punch bowl and it was fantastic. (Another perk about Vegas is that you can take your alcohol in a to go cup!) We then had the calamari and Carmine's salad. The calamari had a great breading and came with red sauce. It had the hoops and the tentacles and was devoured by our group. The salad was also super full of flavor and ingredients. From olives to peppers and the dressing was creamy and flavorful, highly recommend!  For dinner we had shrimp scampi, chicken Parmesan, and angel hair with oil and garlic. Everything was flavorful and came with a large portion size. We had plenty of food for our 6 and even took some in a to go box (we found someone to give it to outside on one of the bridges--better than wasting it!!)  Overall I would highly recommend this place especially for a large group!!",

Started off with the salad that didn't taste too fresh and seemed like it had been staying in fridge for too long...portions were way too large...  The highlight of the meal was the fried calamari appetizer which was edible, although the marinara sauce tasted like it came out of a can...  Moved on to the tube pasta which tasted like it was dried pasta that was blanched... The sausage was rather salty and the broccoli was okay.  The ravioli wasn't special..merely filled with cheese...  The chicken dish was a complete disaster, overcooked, dry, and too salty.  The eggplant Parmesan wasn't tasty at all..  ...the tiramisu was way too sweet and wasn't super fresh...",

I'm extremely weary of chain restaurants, but we figured we'd give it a shot because my boyfriend had never tried. In short, service was straddling the line between mediocre and poor. Our server showed little interest in making an impression- come to find it was the end of her shift. After our food was brought out she whisked by us saying \"I'm leaving, so and so will finish up with you.\" Gave us a brief smile and left. No thank you, no asking if we needed anything else. My boyfriend sat with an empty drink for nearly the remainder of our meal before replacement server came in to check on us. Nice.  We had the vodka penne...it was good, in an Americanized Italian sort of way. I'm also weary of \"Italian\" labeling like this, because they are seldom authentic Italian. No exception here. The draw is portion size and I get it, like Cheesecake Factory. I guess we're just not people who like to sacrifice taste for a heaping pile of bland food. I will also add, like many reviews have done before me, the bread was cold. Like...not a hint of warmth to it. Yuck.  If you're not feeding a family, opt for Trevi instead. Much friendlier service and better food- can't argue with that.",

The eggplant parmesean was incredible; not super fried and a lot of it! We also got some chicken wings in a lemon and butter sauce which were incredible!

This was not. The center was cool and parts of the cheese not melted. The chicken parm was somewhat dry and the cheese on top was barely melted. Our server was pleasant, but inattentive. She never checked on us after our food arrived otherwise we would have told her then and there that our food was not hot. We were considering having our wedding reception at this location, but sadly our experience tonight leaves us continuing our search for a good Italian restaurant. My fiance and I are not overly picky diners and almost never send anything back to the kitchen. Had there been an opportunity to do so tonight, we would have. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt that they may be short staffed or something, but we observed many wait staff standing around not looking overly busy. It's a shame. We were really hoping this would be a great spot to treat our wedding guests to a memorable Italian meal.  At the end of the meal our server asked us how everything was when she brought the check. My fiance told her that the food was cold.  We assume she didn't hear what he said as she took the check and cashed us out.",

Not only was it tasteless but the huge portion came out in a matter of seconds. It wasn't hot in the middle and the cheese was not melted on the inside. When we complained, our waitress completely disregarded what we said. She also told us spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna are not made to order, which is why those two come out so fast. The one waitress we had was just terrible. Other servers had to relay our messages to her because she was no where to be found when we wanted to pay and leave. We left the entire dish there, missing just two servings (which were also half eaten) and were clearly unhappy. Yet there was no discount, no offer to get us something else on the menu, also no apology? Just shocked that a restaurant on the strip can make such terrible food, treat their customers so poorly, and still get paid in the end. Left hungry and feeling robbed of our money.",

After being provided with bread, we still had no plates. We waited so long for service that one of us was heading over to the server station to grab plates ourselves at which point our server saw us and finally introduced himself to give us plates and to take our order. Other tables were given a pitcher of water, but our table did not have a pitcher of water; and our tiny water glasses sat empty for a long time. Other tables around us had their plates replaced after their appetizer, but we were not given fresh plates after our appetizer round. Other tables around us were served their main courses onto their individual plates, whereas our entrees were placed on the table, and we had to serve ourselves. Maybe we were not treated equally because we were Asian, or maybe because not all of us ordered alcoholic drinks. The food was okay, but I'd rather go to Olive Garden.",

    "text": "I finished up my conference and had one last night in Vegas.  I'm Italian and wanted a no nonsense dish of pasta and salad.  I came across Carmines in the Caesar's Forum shops so went in.  Since I was by myself, the hostess recommended I sit at the bar.  She informed me that the portions were served family style but I could get half portions there.  Ok, no problem.  After I sat, my bartender confirmed I was there for dinner then pointed out that only certain items on the menu were served in so-called half portions.  Ok, so the pasta part was simple.  I was willing to pay $17 for a two serving dish of pasta pomodoro.  I noticed the sub selections came with a side salad so I asked if I could get one with my pasta.  Simple enough, right? Well, no.  I couldn't get a side salad with my pasta.  I informed them I was expecting to pay separately for it but \"No, we can't do that\".  So If I wanted a salad, I would have to pay another $17 dollars for a very large (serves 4) salad.  So needless to say, I left. Honestly, I don't think they cared.   With all the competition in Las Vegas, you would think Carmines would be a little more accommodating.  (By the way, the gentleman sitting next to me ordered a dish of rigatoni with no meat and got served a very large dish of rigatoni with a large amount of sausage. I guess he didn't like the explanation from the same manager who denied me my side salad.  Because, he left, too.)   I walked through the casino, sat at the bar at Rao's and had a lovely single serving of pasta, with a single serving of salad, one meatball and a glass of wine.  Oh, and I can't forget about the one cup of cappuccino.  It was excellent.",

Comfy chairs.   We had a very attentive server.   Even though we had a party of 17, he made it feel like it was just two of us.    We all tried not to order too much.  I think we order 5 entrees for all 17 of us.   We still had tons of food leftover.   We started with appetizers: Caesar salad, stuffed artichokes and calamari.  All 3 good.    Entrees: both of the lobster offerings, spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, prime rib chops, and some kind of vodka pasta.   The vodka sauce pasta was not enjoyed by anyone.   Everything else was delicious and prepared perfectly.   If it says P.A. for price .... Ask!!!!  Lobster entree was $130.  We finished with the titanic ice cream dessert.  Yummy and pretty.    I can surely say it was a very memorable meal.  I'll never forget.  The food was good but the highlight here was the overall gluttonous experience.

To the contrary, it was pretty good.. A-OK, if you will. My mom and I visited Carmine's for our pre-marathon carb-loading meal. We walked right in at about 4:30 without a reservation. We were seated at a small table, with little room between us and diners on either side of us. Even the waiters had a hard time getting between them. Now, this could be seen as a positive thing, because we got to know our fellow patrons over the course of our meal, but if we'd had something private to discuss... well...  Anyway, onto the food! The food was served \"family style\" in a large party platter. One entree is easily enough for 2-4 people, depending on the size of their appetites. We ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta ($37), with the \"white\" sauce. Be forewarned, the white sauce is not a cream based sauce, it is an oil/wine/garlic sauce (and they don't skimp on the garlic). There were a decent amount of shrimp in it. The taste...just okay. Nothing extra special. In all honesty, I think I prefer Maggianos as far as flavor goes. Nothing to complain about, however.  The waiter was obviously disappointed that he couldn't up-sell us on drinks or dessert, but he was pleasant overall. If you happen to be in the Forum Shops and a group of you are super hungry, sure stop by.. But there's better (and less expensive) Italian food to be had in Las Vegas!",

The hostess stand people greeted us with a very friendly reception and set us very promptly.  We started with a female server, and we were taken over by male server who could care less what was going on with our table.  The other tables around us were getting excellent service by two different waiters.   We ordered chicken Parmesan and added penne pasta, as well as an order of meatballs.  The pasta was undercooked, even by Italian standards. We never had a waiter come back to tell this problem to.  We were able to eat the chicken parm & most of the meatballs, but none of the penne.  When we could not find our waiter, I asked another waiter to please get a manager for us.  I saw the waiter go get a young lady who was in a black blazer and a dress.  He talk to her, but she never came to our table. Then our waiter finally came around and asked if we were able to finish our food, to which I told him that the pasta was undercooked and we could not eat it.  He brought us a bill, that still included pasta. I asked again for a manager so that it could be taken care of. No manager ever came but he tossed the new bill on our table but would not verbalize anything to us.  We stopped him think the hostesses for the warm reception, and reiterated that the food was good other than the Pasta.  We told them that we had asked for a manager and never received one. She did tell me that the lady that I suspected was the manager was, in fact, the manager.  She never bothered. Normally a perfect experience, but they missed the mark on 3-13-18",

I have eaten Italian food at 5 star establishments so I'm not your average inexperienced customer. We ordered as an appetizer the fried zucchini. The zucchini came piled high and looked kind of like shoestring fries . This appetizer OMG simply made my stomach turn. I could not taste Zucchini at all!!!!! I could only taste old burnt oil and breading. I love Zucchini a lot and this was a huge let down and a complete waste with the quantity we did not eat. For our entree we ordered Chicken Saltimboca because it NORMALLY would be my husbands favorite thing to eat. The chicken was pounded so super thin and over cooked and lacked flavor despite the prosciutto and cheese on top. The only flavor you could taste in the entree was the brown gravy like sauce/substance that completely overpowered the entire dish. We also ordered Spinach as a side, this was not entirely horrible it was rather nice in fact I would have liked it to be served hot however rather than room temp.",

    "text": "I could see myself eventually giving this place 5 stars. It's overpriced, but if you know me, I don't mind spending extra on stellar food. Please, read on to see why it's only a 4, maybe 4.5 star review.  My boyfriend and I went here on a random trip to the Forum Shops due to the closing of one of my favorite stores. I have been lucky enough to dine at the Carmine's in NYC, so I had high expectations.  First off, the dishes are huge, and if you are not familiar with Italian food, get ready to do some smart phone googling. There is no explanation of the food on the menu, which is also plastered all over the wall. Classic, homestyle, dishes served in portions enough for 3-4 people. We decided on the chicken scallopini, spaghetti and meatballs, and roasted peppers and mozzarella. We easily had enough food for, four, hungry people. The meatballs were melt in your mouth good, and gave grandma a run for her money. The chicken was beaten super thin and had the most succulent lemon glaze. I would honestly pass on the cheese and peppers again. The mozzarella was indeed fresh, but the peppers needed more. They were just cold and bland. Next time, I will go for the zucchini, I kept drooling watching it be served to others.  The only downfall was the service. Little things like not telling us the refills on the lemonade aren't free, or keeping the water full. The lady who was our server was clearly still in training, but I won't lie, I don't think shell make the cut.  She seemed confused on why two people ordered 3 dishes. I hate when people question how much we order. It happens too often, maybe we just eat too much.   On that note, I will give this place another shot, when I have about 4-6 others with me. Any takers?",

Appetizers (calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and Caesar salad), Pastas (shrimp with white sauce on spaghetti, Italian sausage on penne), Entrees (Salmon Oreganato, Chicken Parmigiana), and Desserts (chocolate cannoli and fresh fruit) were all amazing!  All 48 of our guests could not stop raving about how good the food was and how full they were!  Our waiter, Michael, did an amazing job and made sure we were taken care of all night.  He also surprised us with 2 songs and his amazing opera voice!  I have to give a special thank you to Deidre Kennedy, our special events coordinator.  She was such a delight to work with and made our day as seamless as possible.  She even met with me earlier in the day to go over exactly how I wanted the room and our wedding items set up.    Awesome food!  Awesome service!  I know we will continue coming here on our frequent trips to Vegas and whenever our guests return, they will as well :)",

    "text": "I'm giving this a 2 star review based service: We visited Carmine's on Mother's Day to treat my Mother In Law to a nice late lunch at one of her favorite Italian restaurants.  She's from the NYC area but recently relocated to Las Vegas.  She's dined at the original Carmine's in NYC probably 100's of times over the years.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  The server, Antonel came over and asked if we would like to get drinks started, we felt a little rushed but brushed it off.  We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and water for the table.  We placed our order, starting with the fried zucchini as our appetizer.  We also ordered a chicken parmigiana, veal parmigiana and a penne with bolognese.  Their portion are huge and served family style, which we knew before ordering.  We were looking forward to leftovers.  After 15 or so minutes our entrees came out.  We asked the food runner where our appetizer was so he took the entrees back and asked.  Antonel, our server came back and told us they were out or zucchini today.  When we asked her why she didn't tell us before firing the entrees she said she forgot.  Her entire attitude changed, like we were a bother.  We wanted an appetizer and specifically asked her if the entrees went back would the kitchen remake them or were they just going to sit back there.  She said oh no, they'll remake them.  Fast forward to when the entrees came back out and sure enough the kitchen piled a ton of cheese on the chicken and veal, threw them under the salamander and sent them back out, DISGUSTING!  When we asked to speak with the manager he tried to cover saying it was against health code blah blah blah but there was no way to get around what they did, literally a pound of melted/old cheese. They re-fired our entrees and they came out as they should have the first time.  It's not a cheap place to eat and some people I'm sure save for long periods of time to be able to afford those prices.  When you choose to dine in a restaurant like this you except great service!   We're locals and won't go back and won't recommend to our out of town friends!",

I must say, the food was amazing.   Our server brought us complimentary bread right away and it was delicious with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. We orders a couple of appetizers. The calamari was huge and was able to feed 6 hungry women. We also ordered the Ceasars salad with anchovies which was so delicious. It had the perfect amount of dressing. For our main course we ordered chicken parmesean and the seafood linguini. They were both huge portions as well. There was a generous portion of seafood in the linguini which again was evenly split between 6 girls. We were all able to have a good portion of each type of seafood in the pasta.   Not only was the food amazing but we did have an awesome server. He was very knowledgeable and attentive. We also had another server actually served our food for us evenly.   The only thing I didn't like was the bloody mary. It was honesty the worst I've ever had. I had asked for it to be extra spicy and it was not spicy at all.  Overall, I'd rate this place as 4 starts bc of the amazing food, portions and great service. I'd definitely come back here again!",

A garlic/lemon roast chicken scarpariello had the perfect crispy skin and succulent meat that makes you eat too much.  Our rigatoni with broccoli and sausage was big, lively and nicely al dente.  A nice variety in the bread basket, and my limoncello martini was totally foo-foo but I have to admit I liked it a lot (I accept the shame).  I asked if they offered affogato for dessert, no. But our waiter was right on it, brought some really good vanilla ice cream and a double espresso on the side.  Nice.  Seriously, you should bring four hungry people if you're going to order two main dishes.  You still may not finish.    Carmine's is doing a great job even if they are big and corporate.   It's in the Forum Shops, the epitome of simulacrum.  But somehow it all works and you feel like you had a nice break from whatever conference you came for.  Mangia bene, mangia tropo!",

    "text": "Tale of two experiences.  My wife and I came here twice on the same trip because we liked it so much the first time.  The first visit was phenomenal.  We ordered half a caesar salad and half a ravioli entree.  The caesar salad was fresh, crisp lettuce, great flavor, just outstanding.  The raviolis were hot, oozing cheese out as you cut into them, and simply amazing.  The service was top notch.    The second time we came we were told as we were sitting at our table that we were not allowed to order half meals unless we accepted eating at a high top in the bar area.  I was ready to walk out at such an asinine request being that it is the same restaurant here or in the bar and we just ordered half meals the day before.  My wife was also pregnant so sitting at a high top bar was going to be uncomfortable for her.  As I was ready to leave my wife suggested we stay as she was having hunger pangs and needed to eat soon so I agreed.  We ordered the exact same thing from before after we complied to move seats or eat elsewhere.  This time the salad was soggy and not fresh.  Anyone who has made a caesar salad knows you must serve it as soon as you put dressing on it or it will go wilty.  The raviolis also tasted not fresh.  They weren't hot and the cheese wasn't oozing out of them.  They tasted reheated and stale.  It really felt as if the food we had the day before was now being served to us again today.    I'm not sure what to think of this place now.  I went from writing a five star review to a 1 star.  I am averaging it at 3 but I don't think i'd even roll the dice to come back for a tie breaker.  Very disappointing food and policy.    The rule that you can't order half meals basically means you can not come here as a couple but as a minimum of 4.  I'm not sure if the owner is purposely shunning couples or accidentally shunning them but the amount of food served is just way too much for 2 people to share unless you order a half.  After thinking of this policy, now even the menu being on the wall also seems like a pretty dumb idea.  Why do I have to stand above other diners to read a menu on a wall when you could just put the darn thing on my table for me to read like a normal person?  Carmines is coming across as bipolar and slightly insane.",

We sat near the back and could watch as the staff brought out the dishes for other diners and man just like the reveiws say - portions are huge!   I've been to other family style italian restaurants (bucca or maggianos) and I think Carmines is way better than both of those. We ordered the Carmines salad and anti pasta dishes to start. Then our mains were meatballs with pasta in red sauce, veal parm, and broccoli and sausage rigatoni in white sauce. They were all really tasty- i especially liked the veal parm. For dessert we had the titanic and choc bread pudding.   All in all a great meal - had wine flowing and good fun.    I do have to mention they have a waiter there that sings italian opera -- AMAZING.  He was singing happy birthday to a few folks and came over and sang our group a different song. He was super nice and he's really good! Go see him for yourself!!!",

    "text": "Food was fantastic and one plate would easily feed 4 adults. No need to order more than one dish for a couple and you'll have leftovers for a full meal. My issue was with the menu. They project it in on four or so walls. We could not see the menu from where we were sitting. We told our waitress (blond tall no makeup) we would like a paper menu. She got snotty and put out and said that they didn't have any paper menus that it was supposed to be \"interactive\" and that maybe we could find it online!?? Okay....so had to get up from booth and stare at stupid menu in the middle of the restaurant glaring over a poor couple who happened to be sitting underneath it. Felt sorry for them having to stare at random people's nose hairs while they ate when people went to look at the menu over their head. Sorry but the restaurant left me no choice. Our waitress was consistently snotty and put out through the meal (yes you, blond-no-make-up Miss snooty ) we were laughing that she said the menu was \"interactive\" because there was no interacting  except showing my nose hairs to random couple at table. We said we could keep things interactive and take a picture of our cash tip instead of giving our waitress a paper version! Ha ha! Maybe she could find her tip online! Anyway, great food stupid menu concept!",

We had enough leftover for 2 more meals. Which was not bad since we paid about $35.  They do bring out a basket of bread that was pretty good. The basket had different types of bread some which were new to me.",

Upon the waiter's recommendation, my boyfriend and I ordered the pasta special, which happened to be the Carbonara. I was initially hesitant because I wasn't feeling like a heavy pasta kind of meal but our waiter insisted that the sauce was very light and he preferred it over the Pomodoro, which was what we originally had in mind.   I really wish I wasn't so easily swayed by others' opinion because the Carbonara, as I expected, turned out to be incredibly nauseous. I could only stomach 2 fork-fuls before I started to feel nauseous. My feeling of disgust was only exacerbated by the harsh reality of having to spend $40 for a dish I barely touched and did not enjoy. Seeing as I am in Vegas and all, I guess I could elude this meal to a gamble that did not go in my favor...  The only saving grace of my experience today was the calamari. It really is as good as my fellow Yelpers suggest. But then again, don't let me sway your decision.",

The server was fun, engaging and attentive even the floor manager brought refills and made the evening wonderful. To top all this not a empty seat in the House. From 8 pm to closing the food, drinks and attention was nonstop.

    "text": "We had seen Carmine's during our recent shopping trip to The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace and decided to give it a try for dinner prior to attending the April 30 Elton John concert. The ambience is casual and New York Italian (as am I) with a lot of energy in the air. It was prom night so there were several groups of prom goers who as an aside looked great all decked out. To say Carmine's serves \"family style\" is a little misleading unless you come from a large family. The portions are huge. Our waiter advised my wife and I to stick to a single entree and order it over pasta (for $12 upcharge) rather than ordering a separate pasta dish for twice the price. We took his advice and had the chicken parmesan over spaghetti and really enjoyed it.One note, Carmine's has a Food Valet service, at no charge, which was a new term for me but what they do is box up your leftovers, keep them in a refrigerator and deliver it to you when you check back in at their front desk when you return after whatever you're doing after dinner. We tried it out and it worked perfectly so tonight is a repeat of last night's dinner. The couple next to us ordered a Caesar's salad which looked to be 1 1/2 heads of Romaine lettuce. They each had two or three dishes worth of salad and hadn't made a dent in it so after repeated offers by them I tried the salad. It was quite good; stronger on the anchovy taste than garlic but really pretty mild. I saw their spaghetti and meatballs which like everything else was huge. Given portion sizes the prices at Carmine's are very reasonable; cheap by The Strip restaurant standards. The service was excellent and everything we tried tasted very good. I will definitely return but I'd like to have two other couples with us so we can try a couple more entrees. Three couple with three entrees will mean leftovers for all.",

    "text": "How's the food?  Couldn't tell you because it never came out of the kitchen.  We stopped here in July to get some appetizers.  We came in after 9:00 PM and the place was not busy.  After being seated, our waiter pretty much forgot about us because it was about 30 minutes before someone else came by to take our drink orders.  We ordered our food at the same time and, just as we were ordering, our original waiter came back to the table to take over.  We told both waiters that we wanted the portabello mushroom appetizer (they have two mushroom appetizers, the other is stuffed caps).  They both went away and the original waiter came back again to confirm which mushroom appetizer we wanted.  We repeated - portabella.  30 minutes later (we've been here an hour now), out comes someone else with mushroom caps - not what we ordered.  We told him those weren't right and he didn't seem to understand what we were saying.  We called our server over and he saw what was wrong, apologized and took away the food to get the order right.  We're now starving and eating the all the bread at the table - which is grocery store quality by the way.  Spongy and not crusty at all.  After waiting another 30 minutes (now 90 minutes waiting FOR AN APPETIZER), and several visits from our waiter who kept making us feel uncomfortable by being over apologetic, we decided to talk with the manager.  She was nice enough, apologized for the inconvenience and said that we didn't have to pay for anything - so we left.  Over an hour an a half there, no real food (other than bad bread) and bad service.  Our first trip there was our last.  Hope your experience is better.    Oh by the way, if you like GOOD Italian food, this is not the place for you.  You can tell by the bread when a place is good or not (it's not good here) and we could see what others were getting.  This place looks like mid-west American style Italian food.  On par with Olive Garden.  Good luck!",

We had made a reservation (luckily as the place was packed) and were seated quickly as a group of 7. We were introduced to the menu and informed that it was share style with plates that would feed 3-4 people, and with prices of around $30-35 for pasta I thought that was a complete bargain. This place is a True Italians heaven and really showcases what Italian eateries are all about, huge served and sharing a meal with your family. We decided on the lasagnes, penne all a vodka and a Carmine's salad as well as some wine for the table. The food was incredible and we had plenty left over after eating our body weight in pasta and at a grand total of $40 each I was incredibly impressed with the value for money! I will definitely be returning again on my next trip to Vegas!!",

After eating there it definitely could use some improvements  A major negative about the restaurant was that I was surprised at how they don't have menus and they looked at me weirdly when I asked them about menus. I mean 99.9% of restaurants have menus so I don't why it's weird asking about it. I don't think any Italian restaurants that I've ever gone to don't give out menus. I suppose it was meant to save costs but I just don't get the logic behind this strategy especially when new customers who come here can easily be turned off by this weird lack of menu experience. Now you can say everyone doesn't mind, however when I went there I saw at least two tables sit down and leave after walking back and forth to look at the menu on the wall. I mean when I go into a restaurant I expect to see menus that way I can converse with people i'm eating with about what to eat and such, especially with dishes that I have to share. So once we sat down they said that menus were on a big screen at the wall and If I wanted a menu I needed to take a picture of it with my phone or stare at it from my table or go up there and look at it. Problem was that the menu on the wall only covered certain portions of the restaurant and certain tables couldn't get a clear view of the menu and my phone was almost dead from a day full of sight seeing. When you make a menu on the wall make sure everyone can see it from a table, that way people can talk to each other in what they want to eat especially since all dishes are shared. That way customers don't have to keep going back and forth and risk higher chances of collisions with waiters, staff, other customers or even cause accidents on spilling food and drink on other people who were all dressed nicely. There's a higher risk of accidents occurring when you have that many people moving around a finite spaced environment. Their menu wasn't even that overly complicated so it could easily be a page or even used as a place mat for eating. So many ideas available when deciding your menu. Then they have certain tables not occupied near the menu wall, because I imagine it obstructs the view of the menu or that people would hate the idea of people walking back and forth around you while you're trying to enjoy a meal. Kind of a waste of real estate for a restaurant and loss revenue when those tables can easily be filled. So a lot of problems could be solved if they just created a menu.  Now another minor negative was the food. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either. The pasta, meats, veggies, and even seafood were all exceptionally fresh. You can taste it. Nothing feels mushy, dried or like it's been sitting in the fridge for months. Everything is exceptionally fresh. The only problem was that the food wasn't really hot. It was warm. My family ordered the Prime Rib special on Saturday and it was warm. It was delicious but it was warm. If it was hotter the food would've easily been a 9/10. I mean if I'm paying that kind of price for that food I expect a certain level of quality.   The prices were insane. Just ordering two dishes you can easily top $150. We ordered 3 dishes so you can imagine how expensive it was. The prime rib special on Saturday was $95. But they said it could feed four people. If your family are big eaters like mine, then 2 people could easily finish that. Pastas start at the mid $35 range but adding substitutions adds another $15 to it. Portions are average for that price I would say,   The major positive about Carmine's was our waiter. He was decent and was constantly helping us probably the only decent staff member of the whole place. Especially when we wanted a new table because their typical 4 person table wouldn't have been able to accommodate 3 full plates of food. So remember to ask for a bigger table if you're a big eater.  And like I said earlier some tables have absolutely no view of the menu and you could really tell which were the good tables and which were the bad ones.   Would I go there again? Maybe. It wasn't anything memorable, especially for that price.",

    "text": "My family decided to dine at Carmine's this past Tuesday evening for our last meal while in Las Vegas. There was no wait, and we were placed at a table in the very back of the restaurant. The restaurant itself looks like Buca Di Beppo, and has an extremely similar ambiance. The hostess sat us down, said nothing, and walked away. About ten minutes later, a waiter was serving the table next to us and we asked if he could grab our waiter because we had not yet been seen. Our waitress arrived, did not introduce herself, and quickly asked what drinks we would like. When we did not order alcoholic beverages, she was clearly disappointed. About ten minutes later, she came with only one pitcher of water for a table of fifteen people. We asked her several questions about the menu, and she did not seem to know the answers to any of them. In fact, we were never handed menus, but were expected to crane our necks backwards to look at the large, light-up menu that was directly behind us. She first brought out our salad, and some ice-cold bread. Soon after, she brought our food, and because the restaurant serves family style, we were all leaning over each other trying to gain access to the dishes.   About fifteen minutes after finishing the small portion of pasta and breaded chicken I ate, I began to feel a stomach ache coming on. We left the restaurant around 9 p.m, and I was back in my hotel room by 9:30. I packed up my suitcases and went into bed, but then I started to feel terrible pain in my stomach. I THREW UP ALL NIGHT. I have continued to have terrible stomach pains through Friday evening and went to Urgent Care, where the doctor confirmed that I had FOOD POISONING!!  There are many great restaurants on the strip, but Carmine's is NOT one of them. Treat yourself right and go anywhere but there. The food quality was poor, the service was bad, and the atmosphere was busy.",

The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \" we have a birthday dessert for you \" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work .

    "text": "Overall, Carmine's is probably a 4. There are certainly dishes at Carmine's that are nothing special. The calamari and shrimp fra diavolo are two that come to mind that are just OK in my book.  But this review is about one menu item and one menu item only. The chicken scallopine. I've been to Carmine's in NYC many times, and the Las Vegas location is no different. The chicken scallopine at Carmine's is easily one of my favorite meals of all time. The lemon butter sauce is just amazing. The perfect blend of creamy, zesty, and lemony. It's so good that I even eat the spinach that it's served with, and I usually won't touch spinach. It's so good that I can eat an entire basket of bread just sopping it up. There's a recipe floating around online (from Carmine's directly I believe), but it's impossible to really replicate at home. It's never quite the same. Since the chicken is so thin, this is the one menu item that a very hungry person can probably tackle alone (if it's all that you order). I have a few times and I'm usually not a gluttonous eater. I just can't get enough of this stuff  Over $50 for an order of chicken scallopine and a glass of Chardonnay, but it's so good I don't care. Bonus points for the focaccia bread with tomato sauce on it. Goes perfectly with the lemon butter sauce.",

    "text": "Hello. Let me first say that I have changed my mind and my opinion. My hat is off to the staff at the restaurant ant to the manager, Anthony. We ate there on Wednesday before thanksgiving as a family meal. My wife, ex-wife and daughter and my son and his wife. We enjoyed an antipasti prepared for us by the chef and sent out with the complements of the restaurant. So, what happened. The general manager and I spoke after my last review and we agreed that I should try one more time. I let Anthony know when I was coming and that I was bringing the family. We had an enjoyable table out in the mall, the patio area and the noise level was MUCH reduced and we could all hear each other with no trouble. Which for a guy who is starting to loose a little in the hearing area, was great. We enjoyed a Caesar salad and ordered the stuffed mushrooms. Neither of which disappointed a single guest. We then ordered the chicken parmesan and the cheese ravioli. There was food for all and it was all great. If I had any complaint, which I do not, it was I kind of expected a side of pasta with the chicken parmesan, but trust me it was not needed. There was plenty and I do not think anyone missed it at all.   Everything went as expected and we are and were impressed with the service and the food. It just goes to show you that every one can have a bad day. Strike my first review and go with this one.",

When we sat at the bar to have a drink, I realized I had not eaten since breakfast. I asked the bartender for a slice of the stick bread I saw another patron at the bar eating. He said something while turning his back to me and slid a menu my way. I did not see just bread on the menu. So I said to another bartender the same thing and he said (in a curt way) we are family style and there is the menu. The least exspensive item was $19.95.

We took the left overs back to or room to eat again later that night but we were still full from dinner. I worked at a restaurant  that was Italian in St Louis on the hill called ''Mama Campisi's  It is now called Mama's on the hill. Sadly Mama Campisi past away. Carmine's has it beat by a long shot.

We had Spaghetti with meatballs. Pasta was cooked perfectly -not too soft, not too hard. Meatball was tasty -very soft and flavorful. If there was an issue, the portions were huge and we couldn't order any more than basics for 3 of us.",

We thought it would be a hassle but it was quite easy getting on the strip through the back streets and getting into forum shops.  The shops were closed but restaurants open.  At Carmine's, we were seated upstairs in a private area with a balcony.  The view of the strip was AMAZING.  wish we could've stayed there until midnight to see the fireworks.  Now I know where I want my bday dinner!  Food was amazing as usual. We ordered the spicy wing scarpariello, something we always get because it's so good.   And the portobello Parmesan.   Both were delicious.  It was a total of ten of us and we only Ordered 2 entrees and we Have left overs!  We ordered the lobster fra diavolo..its huge and the chicken scarpariello.  I'd say of you get the wings, don't get the chicken. It's very similar...even though the waiter told us its different.  We got the Italian cheesecake for desert and it was delicious!!!  Again...leftovers.  We love Carmine's. Loves it since NY. Glad they have a location here in vegas now!",

This is now one of our go to restaurants when we are hungry. one thing to remember....everything is served family style! If there are only two of you, eat at the bar. They serve JR portions in the bar. By Jr., they mean more than enough for 2 people! Every time we come, we order the same thing: Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and penne alla  vodka. Delicious! The food reminds me of what I would eat in college on Arthur Ave. In the Bronx! Also, don't forget to add anchovies to the Caesar salad! To top it all off, they serve Peroni on draft!   Oh, be sure to taste the different bread options! The onion rolls and pepperoni bread are great, too! Just make sure when you head to Carmine ' s that you are hungry!",

The chicken parm was the only thing I really liked. Skip the white wine seafood pasta as it had no flavor whatsoever. I was with a large group none of which really enjoyed the food much. The atmosphere was nice and inviting and the service was fabulous. I am giving 3 stars for the service only. I would probably give the food 2 stars. I would say skip this place and got to Joe's which is also in the Forum Shops as well.",

We loved the fried calamari, and the meatball sliders were so good my son and I had to order a second round! The garlic bread parmagIana was huge, and loaded with mozzarella cheese. However, the mussels in red sauce was the best yet! Black mussels swimming in a garlic and basil tomato sauce were out of this world! Needless to say, we were very happy, and full, when we left. We will be back, again!!",

Too bad we didn't have a larger group; because the portions are so big, we could only order one item. The pre-dinner bread selection is always good, and we love their onion focaccia.

Almost decided not to stop by because it was just me and my husband and there was no way we could eat that much food. Walked by there on a Wednesday around noon and my husband decided to ask about the menu. Turns out they told us we could eat from the bar menu and sit at a regular table. Bar menu has smaller options for 2 people. Since we were planning on trying out other eateries while in town we decided to just get the penne alla vodka which menu said was enough for two. They brought out a bread basket with a variety of breads as well. Being that I'm currently pregnant I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail, Pineapple Mule. It was probably the best non-alcoholic drink I have ever had!!! It had fresh pineapple muddled in the drink! I will likely be back just for that! The pasta was delicious and my husband and I devoured it! We ended up leaving stuffed even though we were trying not to eat too much. The size would have been good for three people, especially if you try other things. The other thing I should add is that the waiter was great and friendly and really knew the menu well. The other staff filling water glasses, husbands wine glass, bringing bread were all great as well!! I will definitely be back to try other things!",

Until last night when we were very disappointed. We order the calamari , broccoli and the LOBSTER FRA DIABLO. the price on the menu was set to MP which means they can charge whatever they feel like. Too many possibilities with that but we accepted it. When the meal arrived it looked to be amazing and very promising. See pictures. But once we started to dig into it we found that for $139.95 we have very little Lobster and looked to us like the tail of the lobster was cut off and we had only been provided literally the tail end of the tail where most of the lobster meat resides. For the amount of meat we received this was very grossly misleading especially with the cost. There were no where close to enough clams and muscles. Overall I have to say this was a a HUGE disappointment to us all.   That will be the last time I can tell you we come here and pay over $260 for dinner and feel like we got raped.!!!  Buyer beware. !!!",

Not impressed. Especially for the price.  Again back to the waiter. The guy was horrible. That on top of the happy hour ordeal and the food - Carmine's will only get the mandatory 1 star from me. I do not give out 1 stars lightly, this is maybe my 2nd or 3rd?  That pretty much tells you our experience at this place.  Wish we hadn't have wasted the time during our 4 day stay in Vegas.

We ordered from the bar as it has a much smaller menu and portions were much smaller. We started with a Ceasar salad very tasty but a bit more dressing than I prefer. Then some calamari and meatball sliders. Both were very good and fresh! Try this place if you go to Vegas!",

We were given a private tour of the place and I couldn't believe all the rooms that this place had!   We were here last night so it was also nice to see some of the beautiful Holiday  decorations that were up.   Since it was only the two of us the manager (Jesse) recommended a sampler platter. I forget the name but it had everything, and it was more than enough. (This place is used to catering to larger groups, and family style dinners, it can get quite hard to order for just two people, recommend splitting everything.) The favorite on this dish were the baked calms, absolutely amazing! The least favorite of mine was the cheese ravioli, I thought it was just a bit over cooked. Other items in this dish is sausage and peppers, fried polenta (soo delicious and unique!), mussels, eggplant, stuffed mushrooms and calzones. We also ordered a couple of medium carafes of wine which was perfect.  The manager (Jesse) guided us through the entire menu including our wine selections and everything turned out more than amazing! It was so nice to see a manger take pride in his work, not to mention his striking well groomed appearance! We will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "So I need to write a follow up review that is long overdue since my first visit back in 2013. I was back here in May of 2016 and not because I wanted to, but because I had clients that happened to enjoy this restaurant because their children love the calamari here.   I didn't interact too much with the hostesses because my party was already sitting down.  I can tell I was dealing with a whole new group of host and hostesses! This was already a plus since I had an issue with their attitude. And this was just by them greeting and welcoming me in the restaurant!   I was quite impressed with our waitress; very attentive and was always checking up on us. The drinks were generous pours (I was drinking whiskey on the rocks) and my clients were having wine.  The kids loved the calamari and the food was good!  I only had one calamari tentacle and one bite of the lasagna.  I was not hungry at all that evening but I can tell from one amuse bouche size bite was sufficient enough for me to count it as an okay place to come.  The food however is heavily catered to an American palette.    I would love to give this property five stars just for the service that I got from this specific waitress, however I use this place for catering during the holidays and I can't seem to shake off the inconsistency in miscommunication when ordering via email or phone. However, great improvement since they opened.",

I had been to the restaurant in NY so I knew the portions were good size. They were very nice to us and accommodating! Only bad thing is we ordered 2 salads, 2 other apps and 6 entrees which was WAY WAY WAY too much food. We could have all split one salad and maybe 3 entrees tops. All things considered, the meal was an incredible amount of food for the cost.  I docked a star because the waiter should have told us not to order so much food and it would have been way less money per person. Overall, I would def say thing place is great for groups.

It looks expensive, but when each plate serves 4-5 people it actually breaks down to be pretty cheap. The smell while walking around the forum shops drew us in. Only thing I don't like is that they wouldn't let us add chicken to our Caesar salad. Waitress told us we would have to order a separate chicken dish, which doesn't make sense. Although you can add chicken to Caesar salads if you sit in the bar area where portions feed 2-3. I also would like the option to order single portions, and not only family style.",

We ordered fried calamari and Caesar salad for apps, prime rib chops special and rigatoni sausage and broccoli country style for entrees, and tiramisu. I also got a red sangria. Despite dishes being so large, we did not wait long for food, a couple of people in our party waited a while for drinks. None of the food disappointed. My mom seemed to have a great birthday meal.

We had a salad and the veal parmesan (for the two of us) and it could have easily fed 4-5 adults.

    "text": "A big disappointment. My brother and I went here to see if they are as good as they claim. Nah. Go somewhere else. They say they serve large family style portions to feed at least 4 hungry people, Italian \"generous family\" style. We ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, about $38, and while it came on a big plate, there obviously was not enough pasta. So after two small portions each, we were left hanging. There was still some meat sauce, so we asked if we can just get some more spaghetti. The waiter said the manager said it will be $12.50 more. Since we were unsatisfied, we had to bite the bullet and order it. But I felt ripped off. If they had given enough pasta to begin with, there would not have been this problem. My brother and I always eat at Buca di Beppo and we never ever had this problem. And, my big complaint is pasta is cheap. In my opinion their True hospitality and good business sense to make the customer happy would have been to just give us the extra portion of pasta just to be satisfied, as opposed to being reamed. PASTA IS CHEAP. Or, if they wanted to charge, max. should have been $6.  The waiter was also not a very pleasant guy. He was always hurrying, he had no genuine interest, he was perfunctory. Proof: we had to ask for bread. We had to ask for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip the bread. And though we still had not finished the bread, he swoops away the olive oil and vinegar. We had to ask for it back.  Finally, this place is really a joke. When you call a place LEGENDARY, it's reputation is vaunted, by its length of it in business, at least, arbitrarily, around 30 years; it has served actual LEGENDS, this being Vegas, it should have served and has documented patronage by Sinatra, Elvis, etc. And to be a legend, it really should be respected and renown; Carmine's IS A LEGEND IN THEIR OWN MIND, ONLY. Look at their sign: ESTABLISHED 1990. THAT IS HARDLY A LEGEND. Overstated, just tooting their own horn, with nothing to back it up. With all the great Italian restaurants here in Vegas I am sorry we even went here. Appropriate descriptions would have been \"Famous Italian food\", or \"Celebrated Italian Cuisine\". LEGEND? Since only 1990? Have you noticed True legendary places? Vacheron watches, depuis (since) 1755. So give me an effing break Carmine's.  I also politely told them there, and through their comment place, at their website, of my utter disappointment. No reply. In other words, they don't really care about customer service. All they want is $$$$. This place may go on for a while due to foot traffic. But you can rest assured I DO NOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. I'd rather go to Buca or the many other fine Italian restaurants here in Vegas.",

    "text": "There were just too many things about my dinner that I didn't like - from subpar food to surly service.   The style of Carmine's itself may appeal to some people, perhaps large families, but for me much of it seemed contrived by some \"idea man\" that wants a gimmick and sets that as a higher priority than anything else. To start,. three of us were seated and given two menus.  When I asked for another my server explained (with a little too much exasperation, as though this happens too many times) that the restaurant is family style and there are menus on the wall, so they only give every other person a menu.  When I just smiled, she gave me a menu.  Thank you. The menu didn't have descriptions below the items.  I love Italian food and can be equally happy with authentic Italian or with Americanized Italian food.  But some of the dishes, like Chicken Scarpariello, I am not familiar with.  If you purposely print a menu designed to make your customers ask for details, then employ servers that are friendly and willing to describe things.   Family style dining isn't a bad idea, but what happens when the salads are $23 and only 2 of the 3 people are in the mood for salad?  Well, my friend, you are out of luck.  The salad is easily large enough to serve 7 people and is piled so high on the plate that when the food runner plates it up for you several pieces fall all over the table.  You could splurge and just order far more than you could eat, or somebody gets shorted. Main courses were also easily able to feed 6 people or so.  We tried the pasta special of 4 pastas on a platter.  They were all very mediocre.  In fact nothing stood out as being even marginally better than something I could buy frozen at Trader Joe's and reheat in my microwave.   We shared a bottle of wine and here the server actually anticipated a problem that probably occurs often.  Apparently their wine glasses are the same as their water glasses - a very small juice glass.  She warned us of this as soon as we ordered and offered to bring stemware. Yes, please.  The wine was nice, but BIG PET PEEVE: Some wines need decanting.  If you are too casual of a restaurant to do this, fine.  Just don't sell wines that need decanting!!  Do you know how unpleasant it is to be caught up in conversation only to take a final sip of wine and fill your mouth with sediment???? UGH! And, since I am on a roll...why use water glasses that are so tiny?  Whoever made that decision should have realized that directly corresponds to needing more staff available to refill.  Nope, in reality it means sitting without water for a good part of the meal.  Hello, it's a desert out there! Dessert choices were confusing.  Again, no descriptions on the menu and now no prices.  This I really do not like.  Why wouldn't you have prices??  Oh, someone's brilliant idea of forcing our surly server to have to explain.  Well, this one you can order 2 or 4, but this one is only one size and big enough for 6 and this one is sold individually....Seriously?  Why make it so confusing?  Even with all of that disappointment, I would have considered at least one more star if there was even anything in our copious leftovers that I would have bothered taking home to reheat.  Nope, it was all blah.  Even the bread was ick.  Big Italian sin in my book.",

    "text": "Wow is all can say about both the food (quality, presentation and portion size) and the service (Make sure to ask for Angelo!)  We started with the chef antipasto platter which yielded many flavorful Italian classics.  Simply a joy for your taste buds.  Angelo was a very knowledgeable server making excellent recommendations and served a small portion of each meal making sure each diner had a sample of everything that was ordered.  After all, Carmine's is family style dining!  It is a long meal so make sure you have good company and plenty of topics to discuss but your mouth will be full most of the time savoring each delicious bite!  Along with the server, bussers are attentive refilling water, dropping off dishes or clearing the table.  I would tell you to save room for dessert but I think that may be an impossible task!  Next visit might be for dessert only! Great Job to the entire team at Carmine's...give the cooks a kiss from me.",

We had a wonderful dinner with a huge salad, shrimp scampi, and penne pasta with vodka sauce. All the portions are huge and served family style. Our server Kyle was very attentive and provided exceptional service. We ended the dinner with a fabulous ice cream dessert and cappuccino. We will definitely be back.",

Stopped in here tonight for my birthday dinner with my wife and I gotta say, Carmine's didn't disappoint. **please keep in mind that Carmine's is set up as family style dishes and everything else is a la carte. My wife and I made the mistake of ordering garlic/mozzarella bread as an appetizer and was given an enormous portion that could've fed a small village! For our main dish we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were probably the best I've EVER eaten, and their marinara sauce wasn't too shabby either.   The food runners were fantastic and the hostesses were super helpful and friendly! The ONLY not so positive was our server. She was polite and friendly at first, but towards the end of our meal it felt like she was trying to rush us out of there. The restaurant wasn't even close to full and there wasn't a wait so I didn't understand what the rush was for? Oh well.. Overall, our experience was amazing and we will DEFINITELY come back when we are in Vegas in March. To my foodies out there, make it a point to stop by here, but make sure you come with more than 2 people or you will have a ton of leftovers. TWO THUMBS UP for Carmine's!",

This is your white table cloth traditional family style Italian restaurant.   By Family style we're talking about extended family! HUMONGOUS portions delivered to your table to feast on. A menu filled with a plethora of pasta, salad, meat and dessert dishes are displayed on the wall of the restaurant for patrons to choose from. My party of 4 opted for the famous Jumbo Shrimp Parmesan and spaghetti. This meal was perfect. Pasta was cooked to perfection and THE SHRIMP! I don't even like shrimp. The shrimp were HUGE, fresh, and succulent.. Lightly breaded to give it a crisp texture. Not overly cheesy or salty. Our party could hardly finish the platter after over indulging in the bread basket.   If you are traveling with family or a group make this your 1st dinner destination.  This is a deliciously cost effective way to dine.",

I have also have come to learn that the Chicago Carmine's has no relation to either of these which may be the reason I don't seem to care of Carmine's in Chicago... yet I digress. Carmine's Las Vegas can be best described by three words: large, hearty, Italian.  We ended up here with a huge group of friends a couple months back when in Las Vegas and of course did everything family style. They serve all the Italian classics you can possibly dream of and are not shy at all with the portions. My favorite was the rigatoni! Their red sauce has that nice deep and rich flavor to it. Yums!  Anyways, would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as it does seem to be quite the popular spot. No issues with the service here. Very prompt to grab you another drink and refill your waters, which is always appreciated when you find yourself drinking on and off the entire weekend in Vegas. I'll have to say its definitely a bit on the pricier side of the spectrum, but with the large portions you'll definitely have leftovers to take home. So all in all you do seem to get what you paid for.  Not sure I got much else on this one. 'Til next time, cheers!  100/365",

They're legitimately family sizes and I suggest ordering only three items if you're five in a group or two items if your group doesn't eat a lot. We had the calamari, lasagna, and the shrimp pasta with red sauce and angel hair, and a Cesar salad; we didn't finish any of it.   The salad and calamari were decent and I had more of the salad than I should because it was so cheesy and the dressing was just so tasty. The shrimp pasta just had a simple red sauce but it was satisfying. According to my mom and sister, the lasagna was meaty and also very tasty.   Overall, we had a satisfying meal and our server was very attentive. Also, shout out to one of the cute waiters out there, kinda looked like John Oliver from afar LOL!",

Host was sweet and recommended that we eat at the bar because my wife is pregnant and wasn't super hungry for those crazy large, family style dishes (though they looked awesome). Ravioli was good and the atmosphere seems fun, but the young boy who served us in the bar didn't treat us very well. He socialized with all the tables around us, but blatantly ignored my wife and I. He never brought water, never brought bread, never checked in on our food, and didn't offer us dessert. It was bizarre. Not sure what rubbed him the wrong way, maybe the smaller ticket on our table? It was obvious and pretty uncomfortable. It's the only poor service we had on our trip. Won't be back.",

The staff is always extremely friendly, quick & attentive. I've sat in the bar each of the 4 times I've visited. I believe that's where they have smaller portions & the other seating is family style if I remember correctly. I've had manicotti & cheese ravioli, both of which are beyond delicious. But can we please talk about the bread? I mean, it's the best bread I've ever had! It comes in a variety basket with oil, vinegar & fresh grated Parmesan. There's a specific piece of bread that has sort of a tomato crust that I could literally eat 20 pieces of! I've seen the manager in action and he is on top of things. I appreciate the great service and yummy food! Can't wait to come back!",

We ordered the Portobello mushroom appetizer, which was fantastic. I highly recommend this dish, if you eat at this restaurant.   We also ordered a few pasta dishes, including two orders of each of the spaghetti & meatballs and the penne pasta with marinara. The spaghetti & meatballs were good. Nothing particularly special, but it was still satisfying. This review is mainly for the penne pasta. We ordered two orders of the penne pasta. One was good. The other, though, was terrible. The pasta was practically crunchy still. We told the waitress, and she called over her manager. He said that, \"We were just American and pasta is supposed to be like that in Italy\". He took it and had it remade. The same thing happened. It was under-cooked. We called over the manager again and told him. Again, he told us that we just didn't know how pasta was supposed to be. I have many friends who are from Italy, so I texted them. They all said that our dish was under-cooked. I really do not recommend any of their penne dishes. Everything else seemed good.   I was disappointed in the service, especially the remarks about us not knowing what pasta is supposed to be like because \"we are American,\" which was even more mind-boggling because he was American too. Anyway, I do not recommend the penne. See attached photos for pictures of the pasta.",

As others have noted, food is served family style and are very large (and somewhat pricey) portions.   Ordered Caesar's Salad, Spaghetti with Meatballs, and Chicken Scarpariello for our party of four. Also had beer, red wine, and Sangria.   The food was quite disappointing. Extremely average and pedestrian. While many have complimented the Caesar's Salad as being garlicky and tasty, ours was somewhat dry and bland. The Spaghetti and Chicken were also very average.   Truthfully, a member of our party correctly commented that we could have had superior food at half the price by going to Buca Di Beppo. I would not recommend.",

But, their online reservation said that they were all booked, and they did NOT pick up their phone!! How rude!   Well, Carmine's to the rescue!  I was able to book a table for 7 via Opentable and we were haangry!   The restaurant is located inside of The Forum Shops at Caesars, so it's a bit hard to find.  It's also VERY loud inside the restaurant, and our big table had a hard time conversing.  Yet, the service was friendly and the food was outstanding!!!!  We started with the Carmine's salad which had loads of veggies and cold cuts, and the Clams on the Half-shell were so fresh and only $20!  We also got their Shrimp Scampi with Angel Hair and Balognese with  Linguine. We ended with the Chocolate Torta which is a flourless chocolate cake, and even though we were all stuffed, we ate that whole thing up!    We heard that Carmine's was like Buca di Beppos, but the Carmine's food was 10X better than Buca with regards to quality and taste. We all said that we were definitely coming back the next time we were in Vegas!   Just know that it's a family style restaurant, so the food portions are huge (meant to be shared) and it's loud (family gathering).",

The prices are fair for the portions which is a plus, but it's difficult to finish and everything was really salty.  The service was fantastic, no complaints there. The drinks were too sweet, i couldn't enjoy any of them.   I wouldn't come back but i guess if its your first time it could be a nice experience.",

Entrees and appetizers are big enough to share between at least 3 people. We got the zucchini fries (which I wouldn't recommend as the zucchini was cut to small and all you could taste was batter), and the pasta with vodka sauce (came with vegetarians so we didn't order anything with meat), which was delicious. We actually split the meal between four people and it was enough food (we also had a few beers).  Prices are actually good for the location, and Carmine's usually cost $30+ for entrees, but again the portions are huge. Definitely recommend this place if you're with a group.",

The strawberry shortcake was to die for. So much food just try not to over order. Staff came and sang HB to our friend, nice touch! Our waiter, Ken, is so polite and respectful of us.

This is a family style restaurant with portions that can feed a group of 4 maybe even more, depending on how much you eat.   The service is good, but the only downfall is that they don't have a menu to give to you. The menu is on screens located on the walls of the restaurant. It is big enough to see, but if someone walks by the table you lose your sight. It's hilarious when you're looking at other people trying to read the menu. I've seen a few people sitting at the tables bob and weave through people passing by. (It's embarrassing if it was you doing it)  The atmosphere is a little loud and can get hectic sometimes, but It's a great place to try if you're looking for Italian food.

Didn't even look at our faces when she talked and told us that the place is full for next two hours. When we checked Open Table, they had openings every 15 min so she was totally lying so that she didn't have to do her job that she is actually hired for.   So I was able to make a reservation within seconds that would allow us to get seated within 15 min. However we were able to find a seat at the bar which allowed us to bypass dealing with her again.   2) Food was incredibly cold! We ordered chicken parmesan and some pasta. After waiting for 20-25 min, I was expecting to be at least a little warm! Who serves cold pasta and chicken?!?!",

Like many New York, LA or celebrity owned restaurants in other cities, when they come into Las Vegas, sure it's the same menu they usually even look somewhat similar but there is just that \"it\" factor, that vibe, that's missing. One part is maybe even just the staff. When you're at Carmines in New York all of the staff has that New York attitude that is just so amazing and fun. One things that did make me really feel like I was in New York, was the fact that Carmine's is inside the Caesars Forum so there are no views of palm trees or the desert to be had. The other thing is that the place was decorated for Christmas, there's just something about Christmas in New York that is very special and inviting.    So if you are wondering around Caesars looking for somewhere to eat or craving some good ol' New York style Italian food, I highly recommend popping in to Carmines. Hey, it is Vegas after all, it's all about excess; whether that means spaghetti or slot machines!",

It was really pricey even with the large portion. Most of the dishes were over salted and the complimentary bread was COLD. It wasn't even room temperature. Asked if they could heat it up a bit and said they couldn't. You have a whole freakin kitchen back there and you can't toast bread just slightly??  Stick with Bucca.

    "text": "Checked out Carmines with my fellow Yelper Amar B. this Halloween. I've heard alot about this place so I was pretty excited to see what they had to offer. Carmine's occupies the former Planet Hollywood restaurant spot inside the Forum Shops. My first thoughts walking in were \"wow this place is huge and empty.\" The restaurant is massive, vaulted ceillings, tons of pictures and sizeable bar.  The food here defintely gives 'family style\" dining a whole new meaning as the portions here on the are massive. I have never seen a restaurant regularly serve up so much food. The appetizer and two entrees we order were more than enough to feed the seven of us. Unfortunately, Carmine's failed to follow the common mantra of quality over quantity.  We started with ordering the Garlic Bread Parmigianino as a appetizer. The huge texas toast style slices of bread totally caked with a thick layer of Parmesan cheese and garlic seasoning. After about half through the slice, the oil from cheese and spread became overwhelming and I had to put it down. The Chicken Contadina was OK at best, huge pieces of bone-in chicken got cold too quickly and the sausage that accompanied it was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The last dish we had, Rigatoni Bolognese, was the best out of the three, the meat sauce and the pasta complimented each other nicely and dish was full of flavor.  Service was a bit below average for this type of restaurant. Our server came around infrequently to refill our miniature glasses of water and didn't even offer us a wine list or dessert menu. Not sure if he was just having a bad day but he came across as very uninterested, hurried, and unhospitable.  Carmine's is certainly not cheap, most entrees run anywhere from $30-$50 but keep in mind that they are meant to feed a large group of people. The place has a lot of potential and I would love to come back and check out some of their other offerings.",

    "text": "I used to work here in the Forum Shops and was one of those anticipating for Carmine's to open and finally got to try them out last week. I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there, so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table, my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen, so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness(tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade), too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served.  So here is the break down of the food:  Carmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries, nuts, and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the $3 difference.   Calamari- pretty standard, wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants.     Zuppa Di Clams (white)- I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish, pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta.  Broiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey, costing $80.  Chicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back.   There was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come, I'll also order the Rigatoni & Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side, but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for.",

I would def say that this is more of a group type of restaurant than a 'bring a date' place. But if there are just 2 of you, they have open seating by the bar with \"half portions\".  We sat at the open seating pretty easily. The service was fast and the food came out pretty quickly. I recommend the rigatoni bolognese.... mmmmmmmm.  But all the food we got here was really good, even the bread.  I waddled out of this spot  content and full feelin like Fat Tony.  Go to Carmine's with a big appetite and bring some friends to help you eat.",

    "text": "I visited Carmine's NYC during Thursday Oct 31st (Halloween,) for dinner and this place was pretty empty. We had originally made a reservation for 7 people for 7:30pm, but when we arrived a little less than half of the restaurant was still empty. As we arrived the restaurant had a very interesting layout but you could still feel the Italian roots. There are no elaborate walls or breaks in the dining area its all one large box covered with pictures and a massive ceiling. Carmine's offers a list of authentic Italian dishes, including but not limited to Antipastas, Rigatoni, Chicken Contadina, Garlic Bread Parmigianino, and not to mention their 20ft wine rack in the front of the restaurant.  During our visit, our party had ordered Garlic Bread Parmigianino for appetizers, Rigatoni A Bolognese and Chicken Contadina as our entrees. The garlic bread seemed a bit too authentic for my taste; it consisted of large cuts of bread caked with Parmesan cheese which I thought was icing at first. The Rigatoni Bolognese, which was essentially Rigatoni pasta with a meat sauce, was much better in taste and quality, the pasta was a bit cold but the meat sauce had a good consistency and flavor. Likewise the Chicken Contadina, was served with a similar pasta however the chicken was bone-in and got cold quickly. Two things I didn't enjoy very much.  Overall the service was a bit above average, our server was definitely very knowledgeable of the menu and had proper etiquette when it came to serving us and maintaining the cleanliness of our table.  The ambiance was about what I expected, as I mentioned earlier the restaurant is laidback and has a very spacious layout with a high ceiling, which I like. There were picture of random Italian figures all across the walls, which contributed to the new world Italian roots feel. I would say this restaurant was a good representation of what to expect from authentic Italian restaurants in the US.   In a nutshell, this place is a more expensive Buca de Beppo with moderately better quality food. I was definitely not impressed and would rate my experience average at best. Unfortunately family style restaurants don't really do it for me as the food always ends up cold less than halfway through the meal. Overall, this is a great casual restaurant to get the authentic feel of Italian family style dining. There were no service failures or defects with the food, however it was a one-time experience for me.  *Tip* order cautiously! We had 7 hungry guys at our table, 1 appetizer and two entrees were enough to fill us up! Portions are HUGE... hence why they cost as much as an arm and a leg.",

We felt embrassed, upset and lost our appeite. Everyone in the restaurant looked at us it was just Awful!! the waiters moved us to another table along with the 2 plates. while we waited for about 17 minutes for the manager to come out with claim papers to fill out and told us that the staff person was a new dad and  that he was sorry but if the man was tired he should of called out sick or he needs to realize these plates are steaming HOT!! and it could be dangerous to them and the customers its been 5 days and we havent heard back from the corporation office yet.  For the price they charge on the food they should at least  the decently to call to see if my husband is ok. We left very upset and he had to go back to the hotel with pasta all over his and clothes & shoes how embrassing!!! it ruined everyone night. I hope they call so we can file the claim and get our reimsburment for my husband clothes. The night was Ruined thanks to Carmins!",

The Chicken marsala - flavorless  and incredibly enough dry and the Seafood Linguini- lobster overcooked, which is hard to do, there was no white wine sauce, hardly any shrimp, and mussels , and clams, a few calamari and squid. Again flavorless, pasta not al dente...Again dry and flavorless...  The desert , Strawberry Shortcake, had a different twist, not for the better was like a marble cake, applaud trying a twist on a standard but recognize that the change was not for the better!

Must haves include the mozzarella cheese topped garlic bread, chicken parm, penne vodka, and most definitely their chicken wings as an appetizer. My waiter suggested the carbonara dish special, and it was phenomenal..... I see another yelped mentioned it was heavy. From my experience it's a little lighter version of an Alfredo sauce with the best additional ingredients added on. If you still have room after the big 'ol portions feel free to enjoy their ice cream tugboats! Disclaimer: definitely needs a larger party to finish it. Overall, I go to Carmine's regularly and have NEVER been disappointed!",

From the start, their event coordinator (Tara)can't be beat. Friendly, efficient and detail oriented.. Complete full service and accommodated my various arrangements that I made. (The entire reception was easily planned long distance solely through email communication..my preference.) The reception was perfect! The facility is welcoming and classy. And comfortably accommodated 80 guests, showgirls, Elvis and DJ with dancing. The servers and staff could not be beat.. I'm pretty sure none of my guests were ever left with an empty glass and the chef even prepared a special meal for my brother who has a garlic allergy. And the food.. well, True to the reputation of Carmine's was over-the-top abundant. The amount of food has become a funny highlight from all my guests. All this at an affordable price. I could not be happier that I chose Carmine's for my wedding reception. In fairness, I don't like weddings .. particularly the kind in a banquet hall with \"lovely\" flowers, small piece of chicken for dinner and bouquet tosses etc..(boring to me) so gauge my review accordingly. If you're in it for a party and good for guests then Carmine's should be a consideration.",

The Brunello paired nicely with the dish, and a cappuccino ended the meal.  If you are shopping in the Forum Shoppes, it's a great place to go.",

    "text": "Carmine's has an awesome atmosphere.  I really enjoy the service that they provide and the unique dining experience it affords.  Before deciding to eat here, understand that you are going to spend at least $35/dish.  All of the dishes are family-style, meaning that the portions are large.  If you're curious what that mean like I was before eating here, you should know that a single item can feed about 3 hungry people.  Also, if you are going as a group of guys, plan on getting 1 entree for 2 people.  If you are going with women, typically a single entree can feed 4 people.  Thus, with a mix of people in your group, plan for 3 people per entree.  The restaurant will tell you otherwise, but you will be hungry if you don't plan accordingly.  All-in-all, the food is quite good.  I would say that the individual dishes at Maggiano's are a little bit better, but the price is a little higher for a group to eat there (since eat dish is about $20 per person or higher).",

They were attentive, friendly and made the special occasion more special in their own way. I would absolutely recommend this place on these two qualities alone.

My wife planned my 40th birthday dinner there with some very close friends.  We were supposed to get a private room, a 4 course meal, a specialized birthday menu, all for a group price.  Instead we got NO private room, a 4 course meal with the WRONG food that we had pre-ordered, TYPOS on the specialized birthday menu, and we were then overcharged.  When I tried to dispute all of this with the manager - BRETT BODE -- he said there was nothing he could do about it except offer to take a few drinks off of our bill.  He was rude, aggressive, and could care less about customer service.  When I tried to dispute the fact that they overcharged us per the contract we signed he blatantly ignored it.  When I said I will contest the charges with my credit card company he threatened to call security in to escort me out.  After spending A LOT of money there for a milestone birthday with some of my closest friends, I can honestly say that this is by far the WORST service and the WORST manager of a restaurant I have EVER encountered.  While the food is okay, the service is poor and the management runs the place like a factory shuffling people in and out.  I caution you HIGHLY before bringing a large group into this restaurant, especially when Brett Bode, the manage is overseeing the place.  The ABSOLUTE WORST. If i could give it 0 stars I would.  They ruined my 40th birthday, and I am sure I'm not the first person they have done that to.  BEWARE.",

The zucchini was like zucchini french fries which was not what I was expecting. Still good though! Would probably get something else instead next time.  We went on a Wednesday when they had a veal dish on special.  It was $62 for a huge plate of veal...even the salad that came on the plate was amazing!  We also ordered eggplant parm (my fave and it was amazing), chicken parm, and angel hair and meatballs.  Since my husband and I live in town we took the leftovers home.  I ate the rest of the eggplant over a few days and froze the rest for another time.   I can't wait to have visitors again so we can go eat here.. again!  Makes me miss NY even more but I'm glad I can at least hit up Carmine's when I want real Italian food.    Our bill was close to $400 and we had ordered a bottle of wine, the rest of us had regular drinks.  We probably could have gotten away with 1 less dish and been fine.",

It started with the excellent communication during the planning process with Sabrina who went out of her way to make our day special. She made sure that every question was answered and every little detail was taken care of. Kudos Sabrina you are an asset to Carmine's. On the day of our event we arrived and were immediately introduced to our head waiter, server and comedian extraordinaire. First he started in the most professional manner making sure that all our guests were taken care of and as the afternoon unfolded and he became more comfortable with us he was a total joy to be around. He laughed with us, danced with us and sang with us as the celebration was a total success. By the time we left Michael was a friend and not our waiter. Michael we are deeply grateful and honored to have had you work with us. Carmine's is the place to enjoy a celebration in Las Vegas and you will not be disappointed with anything they do. You can turn your special day over to them and from that point forward your party is one thing you will not have to worry about. They are all about service with a smile at a reasonable price.  And the food is incredibly delicious. If any of your guests walk away hungry it's not because of your decision to call Carmine's Las Vegas. We can't say enough about the service the food and the all around atmosphere. We gave them 5 stars only because yelp won't let us give 10 !!!!!!",

They also have a delicious bread pudding that is nothing like the typical bread pudding you would expect. It's like a light and fluffy cake with flavorful chocolate in it topped with high quality whipped cream and strawberries. Truly blown away.  I passed by this carmine's expecting the carbonara and initially the employees greeting everyone said they had it. We just ate dinner so we left and came back the very next day to have some and our waitress tells us there hasn't been carbonara since about 2 weeks because it got taken off the menu. What?!?! How disappointing.. I almost wanted to leave but I know it's a good restaurant anyways and I tried the pene al vodka which was very good. Not a carbonara but very good nonetheless.   Something to note are the family size portions that they serve so don't be too alarmed when you see $35 for a plate. It's large enough for 3 people or 4 even depending on how much everyone eats.   Overall a great restaurant that I'd suggest trying but I'm just sad my favorite plate is off the menu which was the whole reason I went in the first place.",

Terrible service - the servers seem severely nonchalant. And to top it, a side of \"marinara\" sauce (sour tomatoes) costs $5! Sadly, this restaurant has certainly no Italian in it, let alone \"southern\" Italian.",

Everything is intended to be shared so the portions are HUGE and it's really a great deal price-wise if you split everything with your table. Service was awesome and the atmosphere was fun and lively.   To be honest, I don't remember all the different dishes we tried (there were so many and I didn't even get to taste them all, I was so full!), but here's what I remember most:  Antipasto Plate: Fun, nice variety. Although, they don't really give enough of each item for everyone to try them all so you kind of had to dive in first in order to get what you wanted. But, all the things I did try was delicious. (They had octopus and smoked salmon!)  Fried Zucchini: Super fun! It came in a gigantic tower. I think my jaw dropped to the floor when I saw just how much zucchini we were getting. Haha. It was tasty, but it basically tastes like a french fry.  Chicken Parmesan: Delicious. I liked this one a lot. Definitely recommended.  Titanic: Whoa, was this dessert a monster! It was so big!! Made of ice cream, strawberries, pirouette cookies, etc. it really was a titanic beauty. I thought we were never going to finish it, but I'm embarrassed(proud?) to say we did...super quickly.",

The flavor was good however we wondered why it was chewy. We soon found out why, there was a large rubber band in the cheesecake. The waitress was very apologetic. When the manager did not come to our table apologize or at minimum address the matter we requested to speak with him. He was unapologetic, smug and arrogant we were obviously inconveniencing him. We are locals and could have visted any other Italian restaurant like La Ventana, Maggiano's, Mezzo's all of which are amazing. We chose to dine at Carmines. I wish we hadn't. Unfortunately you don't get do overs for birthday  celebrations, needless to say we were extremely disappointed.",

    "text": "We had walked by Carmine's earlier in the day when we were walking through Caesars Palace. My girlfriend  had heard about it before and wanted to try it. After our show, we decided to head back over to give it a shot. It was maybe 11 or 1130 so there was no wait to get a table.   The seating is a little unusual because where you sit decides what type of menu you can order from. We were suggested to sit at the bar because it was just the two of us. I guess if you sit in the main restaurant, you can only order from the regular menu that is all served 'family style' in huge portions to feed many people. Even the bar menu had notation that the portions would be large enough for 2 to 3 people.   The last couple hours before close are included in Happy Hour and you can get deals on appetizers and drinks. We decided to try the Calamari for an appetizer and then ordered the Rigatoni with Sausage and Broccoli to split. Both our appetizer and entree were served fairly quickly and not surprisingly, both portions were huge. The Calamari could have fed 4 people and our Rigatoni would have easily fed 3. Everything we had was great and fresh. Everything from the red sauce to the Italian Sausage seemed like it was made in house. We ate as much as we could but could have fed another person or two with the leftovers. Seriously, don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach.   The staff were all friendly and the restaurant was clean. The prices are on the higher end, but the portions are enormous. Try to come during the Happy Hour times for a cheaper meal.",

We watched him systematically berate the server after accusing us of eating the plate of rollatini still sitting atop the bar back. Suffice it to say Matt's unprofessional, abusive treatment of the server was on display for us all to see. I asked for a manager (above Matt) to let him know our otherwise positive experience at Carmine's was tainted by what we witnessed and how Manager Matt chooses to abuse his sense of power. What a shame and what an embarrassment for Carmine's if you allow this type of lowly, managerial behavior. Thank you Anthony for your gracious and kind service throughout our meal.   My review would be 4 stars without Matt's lack of foresight in view of paying customers. I hate to see this poor side of management.",

The bread is a bit hard. We got the salad with like every thing cucumbers, radish etc. it was good. We also got the cheese ravioli and chicken parmigiana it was delicious. The chicken parmigiana comes in 4 pieces so u need to cut them to share, wish there were more pieces. I thought we couldn't eat all this food but we did.   The portions are family style. The hard part is to choose something everyone wants to share.   Our waiter was really nice.   There's complementary bread with sauce on top. It's good, ask for butter.   Also there's a water pitcher on the table which you pour yourself water and they fill up the pitcher for you at the table.",

My charge to them was \"I want to eat where tony soprano would eat!\"  I don't want no fancy overpriced veal chop with fiddleheads and beurre blanc and that jibber jabber. Enter Carmine's.   The only drawback is that your going to have a hard time diversifying without a large party. We had five and definitely felt we didn't experience the full breadth of the menu.   The meatballs in red sauce was something of legend. I only regret not getting the full order. Our waiter told us we might have ordered too much since the dishes are family style. The meatballs were amazingly tender and flavorful. You know forget family style. I'd order it just for me.   The prime rib was the daily special. It was amazing. Not sure if it accompanied the price tag but definitely a solid dish.   The seafood pasta had all of the seafoods in there. Lobster mussels clams shrimp. It's a feast.   The country style rigatoni was pretty good. It reminds me of something my wife makes (she's vegetarian) I don't know how I feel about beans in pasta.   Helpful professional service and lots of space. I'd definitely come back for more!!!",

This time the experience was not the same. All dishes were good except the priciest one which was the lobster. There was barely any meat from the actual lobster, it was mostly for decoration. I would not recommend it, you're better off have a pasta instead. Also the service was extremely slow as we waited over an hour for our first main to arrive. At this point we wanted to get up and leave. I'll be back for the porter but hopefully the service and quality also improves for other customers as well.",

We decided to get some Italian cuisine for lunch.  As most Italian restaurant, the tables are usually good for families or larger groups.  The food is no also in bigger servings, to share.  I like the seafood with pasta. It was a LARGE bowl stuffed with Mussels, Lobsters, Squid, etc. in white sauce on a delightful white sauce.  It went very well on a bed of Linguini pasta.  We were not able to finish all our food. I wish we had room for dessert, but it was just impossible.  So we settled to just pack our food and continue with our Vegas adventure.  This is a great place for good food, good service, and good value.",

    "text": "Carmine by definition is a vivid red color, but this Carmine can be defined by heart warming Italian food at its very best!  Whether you go lighter at the bar with the smaller portion of what will turn out to be any favorite or dive into the family style portions in the dining area either way wear sweats or extremely loose pantalones for this dining extravaganza.  With two visits now under my belt and a Vegas outing around the corner I had this on my mind so figured the review was long overdue. Weighing in after the meal? Well maybe that's where the line gets drawn. Haha!  The initial introduction to Carmine's came in the form of their famed rigatoni w/sausage and broccoli. I admit the kid in me scoffed at having veggies thrown in for lunch, but the broccoli itself was beyond tender and surprisingly mixed very well with the main attractions. What stuck out were the rigatoni noodles themselves. Massive in nature, but soft as a baby's fanny. I'd weap like a wee tot for another plate of this actually. The sausage was literal chunks and abundant as if meat was raining down from the heavens.  The other outing consisted of actually stepping out of my comfort zone and trying manicotti. I was on the hunt for lasagna, but had a healthy friendly wife I really wanted to share a meal with so we went with this despite my hesitancy. Happily it blew me out of the water and I wasn't even missing meat in it. WTH? Yeah yeah I know, but when you do it well you do it right. There is well beyond enough to split amongst two people, but I guarantee after the first bite you won't want to. What I appreciated most was the ricotta filling itself. More than enough to not leave you just eating noodles, but it was so creamy and made me purr like a cat. Can't beat that?!?  When the strip strips you down literally and figuratively head on into the forums find Carmine's for some well prepared Italian cuisine and mangiare until the sun goes down. Perhaps comes up too if they managed to stay open that long. Someday?!?",

Too much food for our group and we really couldn't pack up the leftovers because no where to store in our hotel. That was a shame.   We ordered so many wonderful entrees...meatballs, chicken masala, veal and chicken parmesan,  Caesar and Carmine salads, fried calamari,  fried zucchini, chicken wings, pasta Bolognese,  pasta with vodka sauce, incredible porterhouse to die for, sauteed broccoli. Unfortunately the bread basket did not have any crusty bread and Caesar salad had no croutons. They said they had none. This was July 4th and they weren't prepared for all the tourists. We ordered tartufo and tiramisu for dessert.   Way too much food. I was ready to burst.  Loved this Carmines though. I like the food here better than the one in New York!",

Meat cooked perfectly medium rare, chicken was moist, pasta was cooked aladante. Food was fresh and hot. Everyone chowed down.

The lasagna was huge and came on a large plate that weighed liked 3 pounds. The chicken parmigiana was a large serving as well.

Each dish serves 3 to 4 people. As the entree we had eggplant Parmesan. It was good. Not earth shattering but when asked if we wished for additional red sauce, which I always do because I'm addicted to it, it came in a teacup. They do use fresh basil and what I assume was fresh plum tomatoes.   It's the nickel and dime mentality that means we won't go back or refer it to friends. When the waitress asked if you want still or carbonated water, say tapwater unless you want to pay $10 for a bottle of Panna. The sauce in the tea cup? It was five dollars.   If they ask if you want something, make sure and ask how much it is first. We should have known better.",

    "text": "Their Pasta is too good...Mamma mia..  We were in Caesars Palace in Vegas and decided to dine in here. At the entrance, they said' we serve a huge portion and unless you don't have a big party ( I was with my wife), sit at the bar. Fair enough.  We got the small couple table near the bar. We saw the menu, even the bar menu has entree starting from $30. We ordered only 1 entree PENNE ALLA VODKA knowing it 'll be enough for both. And yes, it was more than enough for both of us.   In fact, we even packed the left portion and ate it the very next day. Pasta in red sauce was really great, I added chicken in it and they charged $8 extra for chicken. Nevertheless, you are eating one of a good Italian restaurant in the USA. Our server from the bar was very quick in everything. Excellent service, Ambiance was good too. Great atmosphere Kind of retro touch.  Would recommend.",

Almost to soon as we sat down, Sasha, our server, came to our table to answer questions and get our drink orders. The special chicken dish for Friday nights is chicken Romano. We added a pasta dish, penne alla vodka. Needless to say, the portions are huge. Hard to say which dish I like more since both were excellent. With really tasty food and excellent service, why only four stars. Because my daughter, who is a local, drove here and had to pay $18 for parking in addition to the price of the meal and the show. Frankly that's outrageous. There is no restaurant that is going to rate five stars when there is a $18 surcharge just park you car so you can eat a meal.",

    "text": "Excellent food, great service, and a perfect spot to grab a quick bite to eat before heading to see Beatles LOVE at the Mirage next door.   Based on recommendations and feedback I saw on Yelp, we decided to grab a quick bite to eat in the bar at a high top table before heading to the Beatles Cirque show next door. The restaurant was pretty easy to get to from the street by going into the Forum shops at Caesars. It's on the 2nd floor.   We arrived about 5pm and ordered from the \"Bar Bites\" menus that featured some select drinks and appetizers/food for happy hour. For $6, I enjoyed a terrific crisp glass of Trebbiano (white wine similar to sauvignon blanc) and my husband had Peroni beer. Both were perfect and went well with the calamari we ordered. The portions are huge and even this \"individual\" portion was plenty for the two of us. We followed this with an order of linguine in red clam sauce. It was pretty outstanding and would be worth going back for. The sauce was nice and thick and rich, not watery like some places serve it. The clams were shelled too, which is my preference. I don't want to work THAT hard for my dinner. The serving was generous and plenty for two of us to share.   Our service was great. When we got to the restaurant it was pretty much empty (but it was also just 5pm). By 6pm the place was packed. One thing to note is that they have USB chargers along the wall so if you forget a charger cube, but have your cord, you can charge up your phone while you enjoy dinner.   Definitely a great spot for a quick dinner before a show or otherwise. And with the special Happy Hour bar menu, it was very reasonable too.",

Best to make reservations. This spot is busy! Located in Forum Shops at Cesars. Friendly staff. If we had more people definitely would have ordered the porterhouse (45 ounces!).

(TIP: main room is for family size portions 3-4 people, the bar seating has junior portions 1-2 people, which you can seat yourselves).   We ordered the broccoli and sausage penne pasta (~$18) and the chicken combo sandwich (~$17) for the two of us Definitely WAY TOO MUCH FOOD for 2; probably could feed 3 or 4.   The chicken sandwich was huge (about the size of a foot long), and came with a side salad. The flavor wasn't my favorite so I stuck to my pasta. The penne was also huge, cooked perfectly al dente, and though there was way too much sauce, it was delicious with the broccoli. We probably ate 1/2 of both entrees and had to wave our white flag to surrender.   Our server/bartender was awesome, and was probably one of the highlights of our meal.",

We all shared the Caesar Salad and Spaghetti with meat sauce, rather than ordering one pasta entree and one meat entree.

The food seems expensive at first glance, but all the options are served family style, which actually makes for a less expensive dinner. Carmine's is perfect for groups of 4 or more and is great for celebrating. Will definitely be back soon!",

When we went to put our name in, and again when we went to ask a question, the feeling we got was that we were bothering them.  Not friendly either.  This is the only reason for 4 stars, and not 5.  The waiters were nice enough.  James was great and really friendly!  The good: THE FOOD.  Everything is family style and the portions are HUGE.  For a party of 4, we only ordered one salad and one pasta entree and had difficulty finishing it!  We were only in Vegas for 4 days, and we came here twice! The bread is good; be sure to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar! The Caesar salad was amazing.  Not overdressed and the croutons were just right.  The dressing was great too; you can ask for a side of it. The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was amazing.  The pasta itself was al dente and the sauce was pretty freaking good.

Everything is \"family style\" and while this is great for families and large groups we found it did not work well for dinner for two.   We ordered pasta with sausage and were very disappointed with the portions. As it was family style it was a big plate of pasta but only two sausages, one each. The food was nothing fancy but a simple plate of pasta and marinara sauce, with two sausages added. It was very plain, simple, and underwhelming. Cheap food without a price tag to match. Also the food was barely lukewarm when we got our meal and quickly turned to being stone cold.   Overall our impression of Carmines was that it was overpriced and poor value for money and not at all suited for smaller groups or couples. The food was plain, flavorless and cold.",

We ate probably only half of each dish, which was perfect because we wanted leftovers! Our server even warned us about how large these dishes were...but we knew we'd want it for home later :). We ordered their infamous Titanic for dessert, although we were pretty full already, we had to! it's one of their famous dishes! Pricey but worth it! It's a mix of a sundae, a banana split & the bottom has a fudge like brownie... HEAVEN!! we ate all the ice cream and whipped cream & saved the brownie for home.

    "text": "Amazing! We just had dinner here for a group of 50 for our wedding in fabulous Las Vegas on Friday. It was absolutely incredible. Stephanie was our event coordinator and we did not have to worry about a thing! She was insanely quick to respond to any and all of our questions. We came to Vegas with a group of 5 a year prior to do some recon and after enjoying the food and service at Carmine's first hand, there was no question this was the place!   We booked the private room with the balcony overlooking the High Roller and everything was awesome! We had so much delicious food (and booze) that everybody was fat and happy at the end of the night!   The ONLY bad thing I have to say, is that it sucks that we didn't have time to come back for lunch and try some more food! NEXT TIME!!!  Love you guys! Seth and Danielle",

I understand CES is a busy time. But this restaurant is doing a totally unacceptable job of managing a busy Trade show.   I do not recommend this restaurant for client dinners.

    "text": "I used to love Carmine's in NYC.  As a college student, and an Italian, it was a treat eating at Carmine's in the City.  The portions were HUGE and the food was delicious.  However, going to Carmine's in Las Vegas was not the Carmine's I remember.  We ordered a few appetizers.  The stuffed mushrooms were probably 4 stars, while the mozzarella and tomatoes were at 3.  For entrees we ordered Penne alla Vodka (4 stars), Angel Hair and shrimp (2 stars), and Chicken Parm (3 stars).  The Penne was al dente and the sauce was good.  That is the only dish I would recommended. I love all parm dishes (chicken parm, veal parm, eggplant parm).  However, this one was OK. The chicken was tender, but the cheese was not melted throughout the piece of chicken.  While the edges were nicely melted, the center of the pieces still had unmelted cheese.   With so many restaurants in Vegas, I don't know if I'll be back to Carmine's.  For italian food, there are def better choices.",

From the beginning planning stages, they worked with our budget to the day of they were involved the entire time.   I hadn't seen the venue in person until 2 days before the event and it exceed my expectations.  The Revitro room was huge and more than comfortably fit our 150 guests and a full dance floor.   The food was excellent and there was a lot of it.  It was great value for our money.  The best part was of the event was the staff.  They were beyond friendly, they had plenty of them to cover our party and they made you feel at home.  They went above and beyond.  Our waiter Mike was incredible.  So courteous and fun and he even sang for us!  The coordinator Stephanie was so nice and helpful throughout the entire process.  We had an amazing experience at Carmine's.  All of our guests were commenting on how great the food was.  It made our wedding day stress free and memorable.",

My family were a bunch of starving raging lunatics (we missed breakfast) so we wondered around Forum shops looking for a place to eat (hoping we wouldn't have to settle for The Cheesecake Factory) and then this placed appeared out of nowhere. Hostess was very kind to explain the concept (family style, huge portions, menus are giant screens on the wall) and we just said: We're very hungry.  So we all stood up and stared at the menu on the wall and we ordered the Caesar Salad, fried calamari, shrimp parmigiana and garlic and oil linguine.  And yes, portions are HUGE. We could have done without the Calamari (don't get me wrong, it was very good, but it was too much for a party of four)  Everything was delicious but we had a lot of leftovers. So, to sum it all up. By all means go, but don't arrive too hungry cause you'll order like crazy and then wonder, what was I thinking? Or do arrive hungry, just get a bigger family. Whatever works for you.",

But when I left I felt I got a great deal.  The big boost in my great experience was the outstanding guest service we had. Not only from bartender/waiter that served us, but also from the operations manager that checked on us throughout and incited fun conversation.   Then when throw on the best music played anywhere with lots of Sinatra, Dean Martin, Frankie Valli, Keely Smith and an occasional Motown hit. I love the DJ.  I also love the wide array of photos on the wall. I wish there was a directory. But I did recognize many of them.  Total home run!",

Last minute decision but we had just enough time to put in a reservation and I am so thrilled we did. Entrees are huge, just enough to serve 3 hungry people. we got 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, & 1 HUGE dessert named the titanic. we all shared everything. I highly recommend the salmon platter. everybody dug into that one within 2 minutes & it was gone. they are ALWAYS refilling drinks, but I will remind you they are not free refills. Very nice atmosphere but don't go here if you are planning a date or somewhere quiet. this place is very up beat & seems to always be busy. I forgot out servers' names' but from the look of it everybody here is nice & guiding. it is a bit pricey, our bill came out to $400+ & a tip so if you're planning on going, have some money ready to spend. recommend this to everybody!!",

They are in Shoppes at Caesars Palace(by the smaller fountain) in the middle section of the mall.   Everything is made in house. I personally love their sauces. Fresh flavored marinara, a thick meat sauce, creamy Alfredo and one of my favorites the Marsala.    The bread basket is fantastic, it has 4 or 5 types of bread which is extremely fresh since they bake all day. The meatballs have an old world flavor that most restaurants can't deliver. I had the veal parmigiana this week. The breading was crisp and the veal tender.    Carmine's has family style meals which is best enjoyed with multiple friends. However this year the staff told me they have a limited menu with smaller portions.   I come there whenever I'm in Vegas. Make sure to make reservations. But they will do their best to fit you in when possible.  Enjoy!!",

They bumped us back 40 minutes.   - A friend and I sat at the bar and, although it wasn't busy, it took 15 minutes befor a bartender even said Hi.  3. He wasn't polite at all.

Our chairs had food on them. They weren't cleaned.  7. We ate family style. They brought the food out on one plate. On a long rectangular table, separating the food and putting them on two  plates on each side would have been nice.  8. I didnt like the interior. They had Random chandeliers and giant menus on the walls yet they were trying to be high end?  Honestly, i think this place is overrated. I'm not motivated to go back.

I've eaten a lot of Italian food and there was a spice in this sauce that shouldn't have been there. It was inedible and for the first time in my life sent the dish--spaghetti and meatballs back. I couldn't fathom eating anything else. The lemon drop was not a lemon drop. My hand was so sticky from the glass. My sister hand a drink that tasted like an old cigar. The service was slow. The ONLY plus was they took the food off the check. We still had to pay for the candy bomb they called a lemon drop. When a nearby table's order of seafood came out, I nearly vomited. It should not stink like that. I was sick the rest of the day and the server tried to tell me it was allergies, that's when I told her the food just wasn't good.",

By the time my family was done eating their overcooked veal and ravioli (the only redeeming part of the meal), they had brought my food out for a third time. We had them box it up because I wasn't about to make my family wait for me to finish. Did they comp the meal in anyway? No. And don't get me started on the service. Unattentive and didn't even ask how the food was, we had to tell them they screwed up. Will NEVER return and do not recommend and wish I could give them zero stars. Thanks for ruining the end of our Vegas weekend.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 5 near closing time. They were happy to take us but I could tell they weren't ecstatic. My friends are also crazy and decided to order a lot of food. We started out with calamari and stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer. Then, ordered the lobster, steak, and a pasta dish. My friend intended to order a second pasta dish but the server recommended us not to. My friend has been here before so he was aware that he was ordering a lot. He wanted variety, not necessarily quantity. A few minutes after she took our order, she came back out with her manager and she told us that what we ordered was ridiculous and warned us against it. It was nice that they did that but kind of annoying too. We already got warned the first time.   Anyways, the food was great. Lobsters were huge and the steak was cooked perfectly. The only thing that annoyed me about eating the lobster was that it was so messy. I was wearing a white dress and got red sauce splattered all over myself. Do not wear white. We also weren't given lobster shell breaking utensils. They brought it out but left it sitting at the table next to us. We didn't realize until halfway through our meal. Oh well.   Needless to say, we had a crazy amount of food and ended up taking home boxes of food that fed my family for the next few days. I definitely would not have changed it though. It was a lot of food but each dish was huge. I'd rather have variety cause I know I definitely would have gotten tired of eating the same thing the entire meal.",

    "text": "A group of 8 of us walked into here and looked at the menu on the wall, first in shock over the prices listed next to the dishes. However, we found out that these were family sized plates to share. After the shock subsided, we decided to sit down.  We knew we wanted a salad, so the waiter had suggested getting 2 salads because each salad would feed 2 or 3 people. We got the mixed green salad, two of them. As for the main, we all decided to share the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Rigatoni & Broccoli. Again, the waiter suggested we get a third main dish as he didn't think it would be enough for the 8 of us, but we held off this time.   When the salad came out, boy did we feel the waiter kind of misled us. The salad was HUGE, it probably could have fed 5 of us comfortably. I don't know if it has to be said, but there was plenty of salad uneaten by the end of the meal. The salad was average, I think the only reason I enjoyed it was because I was craving greens/vegetables. Again, when the two main dishes came out, we were really glad we hadn't ordered a third main as the waiter advised. These family sized dishes are no joke. Nothing memorable popped out for me for the mains, I was hungry and I was full after I ate, the dishes were neutral to me - they weren't particularly bad or good.   If you want a place to just eat a lot of blah tasting carbs, this is the place for you. However, there are a lot of other options in the area. Plus, the per glass wine costs were a bit steep. Plus, the waiter was not friendly at all. That is all.",

The food is absolutely amazing, and it is something we are still hearing our guests rave about.  Baked Clams, Shrimp Scampi, and Porterhouse Steak got flying remarks.    Staff was remarkable.   Senior Special Events Manager Stephanie,  we seriously wish had been our wedding coordinator.  Our Server Ron was so attentive to the bridal party and was such a good sport while being roasted by the comedian at the reception.  Carmine's.

The calamari appetizer was one of the best I've had. The atmosphere was perfect 1930-40 and made you forget you were in the casino's shopping mall.

I have been coming to carmines for 4+ years based on my brothers recommendation. My brother is a Las Vegas local.  Had the worst experience last night. Ordered; bottle of wine which was not brought out when ordered, instead I needed to remind them when the appetizers came out. So we had no wine until the food was served. Appetizers; baked clams (not as good as usual, over cooked on top, too hard to chew), side of meatballs (was ok and really the only shining light of the dinner). Entree; penne vodka which was terrible. Sauce was runny, not creamy, with giant cloves of garlic. Almost as if some ingredients had been left out.  Penne vodka was sent back only to have it brought back to the table 2 minutes later to be clearly the same dish only nuked with overly cooked pasta added to the grotesque dish. Which was then sent back again and I asked for it not to be remade. The pasta was taken off and the female manager (Dani) did come over to speak with me. She attempted to resolve the situation by bringing out 6 Cannoli (3 to go and 3 for the table). I am deathly allergic to pistachio nuts and the Cannoli were covered. I told the woman who brought them out that I was allergic and she said no problem and that she would bring out some Cannoli without pistachio nuts. The manager Dani, also came over and I told her as well. I waited 20-25 minutes for the Cannoli to be brought out to the table and finally gave up and left.   Regret going to Carmines and wish I would have gone to Rao's.  Food and service are superior.",

One of our party goes to the host stand and the three girls tell him it will be a 15-25 min wait, and ask for his #. He gives it to one of them and she enters the wrong #, he corrects her and she enters it wrong three more times because of her ridiculous fake nails. No apologies just a \"we'll text ya\" We wait 30 min without a text and watch 3 other groups get seated immediately. We approach the stand and see that there are 3 empty tables. One of the girls catches an attitude and accuses us of ignoring the text. The person that gave his number shows his history on his phone which doesn't have anything received from the restaurant. Again no apologies, just a shrug and a \"Oh well\". We inquire about the empty tables and are informed that they aren't ready yet and again it will be 15min, and another request for a # so they can text us. We provide the number and wait outside. 15 min go by and 5 parties are seated without hesitation. Overhearing their conversations none of them had reservations either. We approach the stand again and one of them tells us yet again we will get to you in 15 min we need are waiting for your table to be cleared. We ask her why she is seating other groups of the same size ahead of us and she just points at the one with the fake nails. She then proceeds to seat another group that just walked up. We left and walked down the hallway and had a wonderful dinner at Cheescake Factory instead. That text we were supposed to receive? We didn't receive it until an hour into our meal at the other restaurant. Tonight was a real shame too, you are one of my favorite restaurants and we dine their frequently but your staff tonight may have cost you our business and we definitely won't be introducing others to your business.",

It was cold and lit was the pre-cut frozen crap that is served around town. Main dishes were cheese ravioli, cold and hardly any sauce. Rigatoni with broccoli in garlic and oil was also cold and dried out. Was going to send it all back but then thought why bother. Looks like the tourist trap has gotten busy enough that quality has gone out the window. How they stay as busy as they are is a miracle. I guess the heavy Cesar's Forum traffic keeps it going. It certainly isn't the food. Won't be back!!!!",

We decided to go with the grilled chicken caesar salad and some fried zucchini... we figure if we stayed long enough maybe we can order more off the happy hour menu. We so did not need to order anything else. The portions were HUGE and they loooooove their Parmesan here everything was covered in it. They also give you a side of it so you can add more.. not like you would need to unless you just want to eat spoon fulls of it by itself. For me it was on the salty side of everything... but I do like the concept of old style family italian restaurant.",

This dish was spectacular - the meat melted in your mouth, the flavor had me thinking that I've been cooking beef the wrong way and veggies on the platter were cooked as though they just came out of the ground and put straight into the saute pan.   My recommendation is to go with a large group because it truly is family style dining. We had 8 adults and 2 kids, and we still went home with 20lbs of leftovers.",

Myself, my husband, and two other couples came here to have a nice, long, dinner. You know, the type of dinner you have with friends you haven't seen in awhile and you want to catch up. That's what we wanted to do. But our waiter asked us about three times if we were done with our meals (we weren't). I felt as though they wanted our table out to make room for another. I wish I hadn't felt that way, but I did.  On to the food -- the food, like I said, was spectacular. We ordered the lasagna, manicotti, and chicken dish with mushrooms, in a delish brown sauce. The portions were pretty much just right for 6 people. The lasagna was amazing, just absolutely sublime. The manicotti was all right, it could have used more sauce.  We did order drinks, and while I enjoyed my lemonade, I did not realize I would be charged for a re-fill when the busser asked me if I wanted \"another one\". $4.95 for a lemonade x2 is kind of ridiculous, and when I saw it on the bill and saw my half-drunk second cup still sitting on the table, I downed it before leaving.  To end our dinner we had The Titanic - a glorious dessert, with brownies, ice cream, whipped cream, chopped nuts, strawberries, and pineapples. You have to see it to believe it, and eat it to love it.   Besides the service and outrageous cost of lemonade I was very pleased. I would definitely go back. I'll just stick to drinks that can be re-filled next time.",

    "text": "This is one of those restaurants that it does not matter how good or bad the food was, but that the employees and experience were so horrible and unpleasant that you cannot think of anything other than that. My husband and I went to Vegas because I had a seminar in the Wynn for Labor Day weekend. It happened to be my birthday on the Sunday, so he took me to the Mariah Carey show at Caesar's Palace. Afterwords, we decided to go here for my birthday dinner since it was in the same hotel. I made reservations on OpenTable. My poor husband is in a wheelchair because of a broken foot, and this made it more convenient since we didn't have to venture far from the concert. We arrived, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. We checked in via our OpenTable reservation, and I asked if we could have a nice table since it was my birthday and we were celebrating. The two hostesses rolled their eyes and didn't even say \"Happy Birthday\" or \"Welcome!\".One of them just took us to our table, which was a tiny table in the middle of the restaurant. Mind you, this could have been their WORST table, and it was really difficult for my husband to maneuver around in a wheelchair and then sit in a cramped table with his foot in a huge case. I saw that there were three booths next to the table, with one of them being open, and asked if we could sit there. The hostess said \"No, sorry. There is no server for that section\" and walked away. My husband and I looked at each other, a little puzzled. I walked back to the front of the restaurant and asked the same hostess and the other hostess if we could please sit in the booth, especially since it would be a lot more comfortable for my disabled husband. She huffed and puffed and said she would ask her manager. I watched her walk a circle around the restaurant, but never asked anyone anything or spoke to anyone, and then walked back up to us and said \"Okay it's fine, but just to let you know, it might take about 20 min for a server to come to your table or take your order\". I said it was fine, and honestly I was at the point of laughing because she was behaving so ridiculously, and because I was in a good mood because it was my birthday and we just saw Mariah Carey. Again, this girl was full of s*** because a server immediately came to our table and brought us water and took our order. The server was a little robotic and cold to us at first, but he ended up being nice. He forgot to bring our bread basket, but made up for it by sending us home with some. The food was good, but the prices were very, very steep. $30 for a salad? If they made the portions a tiny bit smaller and the prices a tiny bit lower it would be better. A couple days later, I checked my OpenTable account and it said that the restaurant had CANCELED my reservation that night 15 min after we had been seated, which means I didn't get my OpenTable points. I was FURIOUS! Obviously that hostess didn't like that I questioned her choice of seat for us, and decided to retaliate by manually cancelling my reservation. What a miserable human being that would treat someone like that on their birthday! I called the restaurant, and spoke with the manager, Keely. She looked into it and said that \"it looks like there was some confusion; the hostess said you may have not told them about the reservation so they cancelled it\". BS. I told them twice! Trust me, I always want to make sure I get my OpenTable points. Keely ended up giving me the points, but did I really need to go through that trouble?",

The executive chefs Michael and Jeff even came out to the table as we were there with someone who knew them personally. We took our servers recommendations as we had never been there before. Went with the Carmine's salad to start, followed by cheese ravioli with a vodka sauce, and the lemon chicken with a caper sauce. DELICIOUS!!!!  The dessert was fantastic! We had the Titanic which was gigantic! This thick brownie consistency bottom, topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and then 3 scoops of chocolate ice cream. Bananas, chocolate cookie type things. AWESOME! We were so full by that time that we did not eat but just a few bites, but what we did eat was amazing! Would DEFINITELY return here on my next trip to Vegas!",

Although the name i spicy it really int spicy at all, usually it takes a little longer for these to come out but definitely worth the wait! The portobello mushroom parm is delicious! For the main course I think you can't go wrong with the chicken  parm which is made thin but not crispy and dry. Also the eggplant parm is the best I've ever had. It is served like a loaf, this is the first place I've seen that at. I'm not a huge red sauce fan, which is why I love that these parms are not drenched in red sauce. If you like sea food you have to try the mixed seafood with white sauce it  has huge shrimp, lobster, clams and muscles served with pasta. They have great customer service. Overall worth it.",

I ordered a margarita and asked one of the bartenders if this was the same Carmines as Carmine Vento the owner of Villa Pizza, a great place for locals to get a slice since the 70's. My favorite shop being in the old Commercial Center on East Sahara.  Well, I was looked at like I had 3 heads and was asked \"where's Commercial Center?\"  after trying to explain where and what and who Carmine Vento is, the bartender told me flatly this was owed by some lady and they were not associated with Villa Pizza in any way.   So I paid for my $13, standard, run-of-the-mill margarita and left the snotty bartender to tend to a pretty much empty bar and making average tasting margaritas. What happened to Old Vegas hospitality? You won't find it at Carmines in the Forum Shops.",

The food was so much better at Carmine's we decided to give it another try...we just ordered additional sides...they did not disappoint. Food was great and everyone went home with leftovers. The 5 stars is because of Stephanie in catering. Her service was excellent and she is the reason we went back a second year and will be returning for a third.

    "text": "My grandparents who are from NYC have been telling me to try Carmines when I go to NYC for years and I just haven't got around to it. I stumbled across this one in Vegas over the weekend though and when I saw it, I knew it was my chance to try it.   Our waiter was great - he explained how the dishes were FAMILY STYLE when we sat down and that those dishes are enormous so that we could try not to order too much food. Of course we still had too much food. The portions are ENORMOUS. He came around basically all the time to fill our water cups and had a great memory + sense of humor.   I came here in a group of 3 people. We decided to order 2 dishes to split between us 3. A pasta dish and the Shrimp Scampi. Note that the Shrimp Scampi doesn't come with pasta itself. Just the shrimp. Both the meals we ordered tasted great - I really enjoyed the shrimp. Note that 2 meals was way more than enough food for this group of 3. But 2 meals gave us some variety, so if I were to go again as a group of 3, I would order 2 meals and take the rest home. Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert after this meal.   Splitting the bill between 3 people including tip came out to around $30 per person which is pretty damn fair for Las Vegas for a nice dinner. Food in Vegas can get really expensive at a lot of the restaurants. Carmines has a great location being that is in the shops at Caesar's Palace. Anyone staying here or Bellagio or Palazzo/Venetian or anywhere around these can easily walk to dinner here which was a nice plus.   Would I come back with a group of 3 or more people? Yes, definitely. Would I come back with just me and one other person? If we were really hungry or if we were ok with a lot of left overs, then yes, definitely.",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate my grandma's 70th birthday and there were about 40 of us, we had a private room upstairs with a balcony with a great view of the strip. We had about 3-4 servers that assisted us, it almost felt as if we had the restaurant to ourselves (which we did not) but we had the whole second floor to ourselves lol. We opted for this restaurant because my grandma loves Italian food and they do family style dining here so it was a great choice.  The restaurant itself was very beautiful and made you feel at home, there were lots of pictures gracing the walls. It was very reminiscent of Maggiano's and Buca di Beppo as far as the decor goes. It's very welcoming and spacious, lots of seating and the people here are so friendly.  We already had a set menu for the occasion, for the appetizers we had Caesar Salad and Calamari, for the pasta we had Lasagna and Linguine with Shrimp in white sauce, for the entrees we had Chicken Marsala and Chicken Parmigiana and for dessert we had Italian Cheesecake and Strawberry Shortcake. We had 3 tables full of people and each table was given two of each dish, talk about an overwhelming amount of food. There was so much food I wasn't able to taste everything (I made the mistake of filling up on their delicious bread before appetizers arrived lol). The Caesar Salad was very good and fresh, it wasn't drowned in dressing and it had a good flavor. Their Lasagna was amazing, it was the biggest portion I'd ever seen. It was layered with yummy ricotta cheese, lots of meat but I wish there was a bit more sauce because we all were fighting over the little sauce that was in the serving dish! The Linguine with Shrimp was also very good, the shrimp were more like prawns and they were quite generous with the amount given. The shrimp were cooked perfectly as was the linguine and the wine sauce was so delicious. But my favorite dish was the Chicken Parmigiana, it was seasoned, breaded and cooked to perfection!! The nice layer of Mozzarella on top as well as the yummy marinara complimented it well although it would have tasted perfect by itself. If I was not full at that point I surely would have had to big pieces. Lastly I tried the Italian Cheesecake for dessert, it was definitely different. It was very light and airy not like the typical cheesecake and it had a bit of a lemon flavor.   Overall this restaurant was amazing and the food was amazing, definitely in my top 5 for Italian restaurants. I will gladly be back when I'm in town.",

Spaghetti was OK nothing special (too garlicky) and certainly not enough for 6 people that  actually eat. It was only enough for 2 people.

The linguine lemon pasta tasted like detergent, may be the didn't rinse the pots, who knows.  Another problem were the artichokes. They were dry, without sauce and clearly weren't cooked since they were hard like a shoe. The very courteous waiter noticed that we didn't eat them and said he would talk to the manager. After that nothing happened.  Unfortunately we are done with Carmine's and we'll not go back.",

The menu is on the wall and easy to read, posted multiple times as well. All you need is to order a couple of dishes and everyone will be overly full.   We got the angel hair pasta with marinara, house salad, chicken marsala, and carbonara. It was all fantastic and way more than our group of 7 could eat! The house salad is basic with red onions, black and green olives and lots of lettuce. The house dressing is a spicy creamy balsamic and wasn't liked by half of our group who prefer something lighter. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the marinara covered it all. I could eat just that and be happy.   The standout food was the chicken marsala. Some how it wasn't too sweet but just sweet enough. There was no bad sour after taste that some have. There was a lot of mushrooms on top which for one of our members was a bit of let down but he worked around them. Get the chicken marsala and you will be content and ready to gamble. Or go into a food coma with all of it!",

The chicken cutlets were very thin, and the chicken itself was not tender. They also skimped on the Prosciutto topping. The cannolis were ok, but taking into account that this resturuant is originally based in NYC (in which the NYC/NJ metro area has some of the best cannolis you will find anywhere in the world), Carmine's cannolis were disappointing. The service was slow, but we went on a Saturday night when the place was very busy, so I really can't fault them much for that. The decor is nice, but this is not the place to come if you want to have a nice quite dinner....the sound level of the crowd is very loud (more like being in a crowded bar, rather than a restaurant). Carmine's is very similar to Maggiano's, serving the large family style portions. I have not been to Maggiano's in several years, but what I do remember is that the food and atmosphere was far better than Carmine's. Overall, I think Carmine's is ok, and maybe if I ordered some other dishes, and it was a little less crowded/noisy, I would give it a higher rating. However, the best rating I can give it today is just 3 stars.",

However, after 10-15 minutes went buy without acknowledgment, we started getting a little bit irritated. Wanting to ensure a good mood for Christmas, I just played it off that they were busy.   After 30 minutes of not being acknowledged even once, I excused myself and told someone that we had been sitting for 30 minutes without so much as a \"hello\" or water. Another five minutes passed before someone came to our table. Following that, they were extremely attentive. The manager ended up comping our drinks for the dinner, and we left somewhat satisfied.   It's not the fact that there was a wait on Christmas, which I would totally understand. It's the fact that we were seated and no one had any idea until I told them about it 30 minutes later. That seems like an extreme lack of organizational skills.  All of that being said, the food here is consistent and delicious. If it were not for the service, I would have absolutely rated it a five. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable, the drinks are good, and the food is better.",

We ordered:  Caesar Salad Calamari Bolognese Meat Sauce Penne Alla Vodka Shrimp Fra Diavolo Angel Hair Marinara with Meatballs Cannoli Cheesecake  The penne and calamari were the best options. Shrimp Fra Diavolo was my least favorite.  Definitely get the cheesecake. The cannoli left something to be desired. It was coated in chocolate and sprinkled with pistachios.  Located in the Forum shops in Caesar's.  Average dish price:  $35",

First thing you need to know, all the servings are huge! Come hungry with a big group. Last night it was just me, my wife and our toddler son. There were so many things on the menu which was posted on the wall. I was told this was intended so you will get up from your table and check out what the other patrons were having. We decided to order a custom Veal Saltimbocca on angel hair pasta. The flavors were simple, nothing to really write home about. Next time we'll bring the whole family so we can try more. Service was good, servers were very attentive. Also on the pricey side, but I guess that's justified by the large servings.",

Drinks were priced reasonably and maybe even poured a tad heavy, which was great.  The food was HUGE as it's served family style but the prices are totally fair.  The challenge with eating at Carmines with 1 other person is that you have to agree on your dishes.  But since we did, it worked out great.  We had the fried zucchini to start and the manicotti as an entree.  Food, in total, was less than $45 and more than we could eat.  That, my friend, is a bargain considering the location and quality.  It's much cheaper than Rao's and I found the food substantially better, too.  You are getting a dish that serves 3 - 4 for the price of a single entree at Rao's.  Heck, it's about the same price as a burger at Ramsay's.  The service is similar and very good, also.  This will be our new go to Italian on the strip for sure.",

Called the manager in the morning and he said he's been a restaurant manager for 20 years and \"If this was from the actual food being bad, the symptoms would show up in about 24 hours, when its immediate like in this case, its from someone not washing their hands\".  He asked to call everyone in our party to check on them...never did.  Did not offer to reimburse or compensate in any way.  Manager was supposed to call back, NEVER DID.  After 3 hostile messages left, he finally called back.  He said \"how did he know that our group didn't eat somewhere together before Carmine's?  How did he know it came from his restaurant?  Did anyone go to the doctor to prove they were sick?\"  We met at Carmines for our friends 25 year wedding anniversary and the guest of honor had to emergency stop on the way home to blow up and spent the rest of the night running to the toilet.  The manager went on about how the restaurant is new..etc..etc..finally after aggressively reasoning with this poor excuse of a manager, he agreed to refund the dinner.  Since the credit cards have been reimbursed, I am now writing this review.  I've lived in Vegas 32 years, a hotel admin major in school and HAVE NEVER seen a manager handle SICK CUSTOMERS FROM POOP IN THEIR FOOD like this. PS Calling the health department",

We had pre-selected our dinner items but I decided to order a round of drinks for our table of 10-- big mistake as this took over 30 minutes for them bring our drinks out and when they did they only brought 9.  I immediately let our server know and it then took an additional 20 minutes to get the other drink after we had already 30 minutes and for them to not bring enough is unacceptable.  These drinks were to have been for our dinner toast which they now ruined because by the time the last drink was brought over everyone was done eating.  When I complained to both the sever and a manager they told me they would see what they could do but the delay was because they only had 1 bartender.....the manager sent over green shots for our table and proceeded to charge me full price for our 10 cocktails at $14 per drink.  At $140 bucks our drinks should have all come out at the same time and not taken 40 minutes---epic fail and total buzz kill will not return.",

I actually made a comment when we got the bill, that this was the best meal we had in Vegas and also the cheapest. I think the spaghetti and meatballs were excellent.  I loved it, and the huge plate was only $34.  There were 2 of us, that ate ourselves into a food coma and we still took a good portion home.  Nowhere else in Vegas can you get that much food for $34.  Granted, my girlfriend also ordered tiramisu and forgetting it was family style, he ended up bringing the entire pie, which was $25.  That was our fault.  So we took that to go to, but she loved it.  I think by far this place is the best value taking into account the price and quality of food.  It's a real Italian hearty restaurant.  I will definitely eat there again.",

    "text": "Went here with my gf last week for lunch at around 2pm. It was our first time. We actually came here because of the reviews on yelp. The food was mediocre this is why I rated it as 2 stars. But the waiter Frank P was horrible.  Unprofessional, inattentive, and nonexistent. I am not exaggerating when it came to his profession as a server.   We walked in got seated waited for our waiter for about 5 minutes. Saw another family get seated. A waiter approached them right away and took their drinks. Then he came over to our table didn't ask what we wanted to drink and told us about the food. He came back in about 20 mins. The other family already received their drinks and salad. At this point I was already getting impatient. He comes by after 20 mins and takes our order. We ordered the stuffed artichokes and a pasta dish. We waited and waited. Didnt know why it took so long since it was not busy. Didn't get our stuffed artichokes until another 25min at this point I was so hungry that I wasn't even mad when the appetizer had come. Not once did he check up on us. Then not long after our appetizers came our main dish arrived. They did not even give us plates. Our waiter was no where to be found and we had to ask a host to give us plates. At this point I was outraged. The food was ok but for it's reputation I expected better food. Then finally after being there an hour half he shows up asks how we were  doing while eating our meal. After finish eating we sat there waiting for our waiter Frank. After  15 mins we found him asked for our check and he puts our bill on the table said nothing. I did not want to leave a tip but it is so hard for me not to. So I only had given him 15% rather the 20%.  We didn't get a proper greeting or a proper farewell. We left disgusted of the service. I would not come here again because the service  was so bad. I expect bad service from a pit stop on a self serve buffet but not this place.  It was an unpleasant experience. I would  be more lenient if it was super busy but it was not busy at all. Just a lousy server.",

The decor of the restaurant make it feels as if you are in a genuine Italian restaurant. It almost makes you feel at home. The food is truly stupendous. I find that I enjoy their spaghetti much more than I like my family's own. Although they have great food, they also have great prices. If you are eating with someone else, it would be in your best interest to split an entree with them. The portions at this place are huge, they almost look like party platters. Realistically, it isn't so expensive the cost is split amongst two people, but you can only get one thing. If you get two, you will find that there is an exuberant amount of leftovers, almost an overwhelming amount and the bill will be pricy as well. If you and your date can agree upon one thing, I would recommend this place, but if you wish to order different things, this might not be the place for you.",

We came here about a month ago for the first time and just returned this weekend because of the wings! The other food is equally delicious. We had a special salad for Easter which we could barely eat (2 adults, 2 kids) it was so large. We also had Chicken Saltimbocca. Holy cow, so good! We had their spaghetti and meatballs last time which was a hit as well. For dessert, cannoli's. Wow is all I can say. The only negative I can see about this place is the seating. The first time we went we got stuck at a table in the middle of the room on top of everyone else. It was barely comfortable.

Not carmines you have to slice with a knife and solid grey in color, obviously filled with a lot of filler, soy?  The two large veal parmingan pieces had to be pounded out to fill the large platter.  It was either a large calf or perhaps ponded out flank steak.  Either way it was chewy for veal.  Veal should melt in your mouth.  Heavy with bread crumbs cheese and marina.  When I complained about the beef the wait staff QUICKLY took the platters away and sent the manager over.  He did remove from the bill.  The scampi was ok, heavy with bread crumbs tho.  I prefer scampi baked in olive oil or clarified butter, garlic, shallots, seasonings only.  The merlot was nice although odd served in small juice glasses.  The anti pasta salad was very good.  The large menu on the wall lacks how a dish is prepared and its ingredients.  I won't eat here again.",

He was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu. Michael was fun, ENTERTAINING, and had the best attitude! He would joke and tease with everyone at the table. He was so kind to stop my father from ordering too many dishes explaining that two main dishes was more than plenty to feed everyone at the table. We ended up getting the vodka pasta with chicken and the steak dish with sausage. Both dishes were prepared perfectly and tasted amazing. Michael was so right! We had more than enough and extra to take home. When Michael learned we had a cake for my mother at home for her he came back with a bowl of whip cream with a candle on it. Can't forget to sing happy birthday! But just the song was not good enough for our waiter! No sir!! Michael announced to the whole restaurant that there was a birthday in the house, but not just any birthday. The big 5 0 birthday! The look on my mothers face was priceless!!! Thank you Michael for making our experience one to remember!! We will be seeing you again real soon!",

The restaurant made a mistake and did not serve the Birthday cake we had ordered and delivered from a local bakery. Carmines could not find the cake and this was disappointing because of the 21st Birthday of my daughter. I had one of the managers from Carmines call me in Colorado. Stefanie one of Carmines managers was a real pro and made the situation all good. It is not that people make mistakes it is how you handle the problem and Carmines knows how to run a business. We will be back for many years to come.",

Waiter (Michael) was very personable and attentive even though he had 4 other tables at the time. We ordered the pasta with the sausage (don't recall thr exact name) and the shrimp in tomato base (again, don't recall the name). The entrees were really good, not excellent, but good. The green salad and zucchini strips, however, were superb. I would recommend both of those to start. The mixed drinks were delicious. I'd definitely eat here again to try some other menu items.",

    "text": "Now I realize that this is a chain from a much older beloved restaurant, that said sometimes imitation does not flatter the original.  The green salad was excellent beyond belief, huge easily enough for 6 hungry people.  The server did warn us that everything was \"family style\". Next came out chicken parm. on Turkey sized platter with about a pound of spaghetti under the chicken.  The chicken was pounded too thin, it was breaded but a bit too heavily, it was very dry.  Thin layer of cheese on top. Now my real complaint was \"hey guys did you run out of sauce\"? I have never seen such a meager portion of marinara on this dish not to mention the pound of pasta beneath.  It would easily serve 8 people.  This is so much waste, especially in Las Vegas where most of us can't take it home...I wouldn't have taken this home anyway.  I would recommend that they offer \"Mama size, or little sister size, or kids table size\" portions.  People might order more than one entree that way.  Very disappointing to see all that food thrown away.  There were 3 of us and we honestly just ordered salad and an entree.  Also, be more generous with your sauce or offer more on the side.  The menu's are on the wall. If your back is to one or you can't read the others your waiter is \"there for you\".  I wasn't happy with this as they don't have time to stand there and read you the entire large menu.  Its difficult for people without the eyesight of an eagle. Many people had to get up and go stand in front of one of the menus to read it.  I think having printed menus would be very kind as an alternative.",

    "text": "No complaints here--went in with the company while in town for business. Located inside Caesar's Palace on the strip, Carmine's is an upscale, family-style restaurant a la Maggiano's, except darker and more intimate. Probably would be a place Tony Soprano would stop at while shopping in Vegas with Carmine and the kids. I has a couple Negroni's to start, which were a bit different than any standard Negroni recipe I've tasted--very lemon-forward and light in the Vermouth; still tasty, though. The menu is convenient projected onto the side wall, so everybody can view, discuss, and order--neat idea. The table ordered Ceasar Salad, Garden Salad (which I did not sample, but the Caesar was excellent--homemade dressing with the authentic anchovy notes and fresh garlic bite), Lasagna, which was a colossal, seemingly 10-layer monstrosity which was a real crowd-pleaser. Meatballs looked great too, but I did not try one. Manicotti and beef tenderloin were both delicious as well. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that it was evident they usually do not bring out olive oil for the bread--when we requested it, we got a little caddy with pale, \"possibly extra-version\" oil usually seen on salad bars. No big deal. It would be tough to go wrong with Carmine's if you're hungry and with a group.",

For a table of six we ordered eggplant parmigiana, linguine bolognese and the Carmine salad. And there was more than enough food to go around...and leftovers to boot.  The bolognese sauce was excellent...but don't expect the typical tomato style. This bolognese sauce was meat, oil and herb based...and absolutely delicious. The eggplant was a many-layered affair of cheese, eggplant and marinara sauce that was devoured with abandon. And the salad had an excellent array of tastes and textures.  The bread basket is filled with a variety of breads, from focaccias to breadsticks, and they generously gave us three baskets in total.  Simply put, if you're in Las Vegas and want top notch Italian food, Carmine's is the place to go.",

It's not as busy like the one in the Theater District in NYC.  They make their lemonade fresh to order: strawberry or blueberry. They use real fruits...but refills aren't free. I personally love their strawberry lemonade because it's real tart...so refreshingly good. Since we're a small family (with a big appetite) we got the chicken scarpariello, manicotti...and the Titanic for dessert. Great bread service...combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan as a dip.  Chicken Scarpariello: Chicken in lemon butter and rosemary sauce. The meat is tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. The skin is light brown and crispy. Even the breast (normally the driest part of a chicken) was juicy. The sauce was delicious. 5/5   Manicotti: Pasta filled with ricotta. Tomato sauce was thick and tangy. 3.5/5  Titanic: Chocolate torta, gelato, ganache, whipped cream, pineapple, strawberry and hazelnuts. One of the best desserts I've had recently. It's a combination of their chocolate torta and gelato. Think banana split but waaaay better. This dessert (just like all of their desserts) is huuuuge. It would take 4 people to take down this behemoth. The ganache is what makes this so good. Everyone that would pass by our table would stop and admire this beauty. 5/5  Our server forced us to take our leftover dessert home. \"Just freeze it and it would still be good\". It looks like a mess now but it's still delicious! Service is a little slower here and our food took a long time.",

However even though it was after \"lunch\" since we came around 3-3:30 they accommodated us easily. We ordered the carmines salad and the shrimp parmigiana- both were fresh and delicious and the lunch portions are enough for two very hungry people! Also the lemonade is freshly squeezed by the glass- yum! Our waitress was great too and gave us to-go cups since we said we were going to walk outside and it was 110 degrees. Overall good experience.",

Everything we had was amazingly delicious  The entrees are sooo good, we had the bolognese pasta by far the best we ever had. The meatballs were a big hit absolutely finger licking delicious. Chicken parmigiana was sooo yummy.  The chicken was soo moist not dry and full of flavor all white meat no fat.. and lastly the garlic bread is a must. Authentic Italian food Carmines is just amazing. I wish i had one close to home.. 5 *****",

First off, if you are a single, Carmines is not the place to eat. They serve Family style which means larger portions at twice the price. I wanted a Caesar salad and the spaghetti and meatballs but that would've been over $55 and there was no way I could eat all of that and staying in a hotel had No way to store the leftovers. I decided to skip the Caesar salad, which was a disappointment because I really like to have some salad with my pasta. The restaurant IMO is much better suited to more than four people where everyone can order something and share with others. The spaghetti and meatballs were good, not great, but I prefer Maggiano's sauce. They state the Portions serve 2 to 3 but I would say they are more suited to two people.",

The calamari was very delicious and tender no problems there the chicken marsala with seasoned perfectly the olive oil garlic dish was prepared with a chicken broth which made it very soupy like not enough garlic taste and the beef tenderloin was ordered medium and Kim Gray all the way through but other than that the meat was tender. For dessert we ordered tiramisu which came family style as well great presentation great taste. Please note the menu is up on the board and everything is family style each dish can feed about 4 people",

We ordered chicken Marsala and it was very very thin and all we tasted was flour. We told our waiter and he took the plate and handed us the bill 70.00 dollars and we left hungry. No manger came over, no apology or offer to get something else. I was so embarrassed that I brought my new boyfriend here and raved how awesome they are . I feel ripped off and very sad",

We had Caesar salad and carbonara pasta and both were quality and delicious choices enjoyed by our entire party.   Two items that kinda bugged me: 1. The menu is on a wall so we had to stare at it from afar and had difficulty seeing it or appeared to be starting at the adjacent table sitting under the menu. It would be nice to just have a menu for my table.  2. I hate when a restaurant insists on making u reuse your salad fork for your dinner. Our forks were on our finished salad plates and the server took them off our salad plates and put them back on the placemat for us to reuse. For the price per entre I'd think we could be given a clean fork for the next course of the meal. Small things make a big difference.",

It was explained to us one part of the menu was based on the dishes being able to serve 4 people, the other merely two.We ordered appetizers , they were huge! We had a big plate of calamari, which we enjoyed.We also had a Cesar salad with chicken , anchovies on the side .I was so hungry I ate the anchovies.The salad didn't have little  strips of chicken - it had whole chicken breasts- it was kind of insane.I ate them!The most insane thing I saw was the guy next to me didn't understand the bit about the menu with the dishes for 4.He was from Belgium and probably didn't quite get it .When his dish came out he looked astonished and I could not keep from laughing.It was HUGE !It would have allowed the entire village to feast.He ate about one fifth of it.Every time I looked , I laughed( I wasn't being mean - it just looked funny).I'm sure he's firmly convinced Americans eat too much.  Carmines seems profoundly influenced by old Ronzoni, Chef Boyardi , Spatini Spaghetti Sauce and Francesco Rinaldi commercials.You can picture Anthony running home for Princes spaghetti on Bostons North End  and people saying stuff like Mangia and Abbodonza.It's actually funny , fun and good natured.Here everyone gets to be a paisan.",

The meatballs, pasta, lasagna were super delicious. Even the memory makes my mouth water #nokidding The desserts on the other hand could get disappointing. The cheesecake and the tiramisu were good but not the best I have had.",

    "text": "this review is for the service and mainly the lasagna.   we've been here before months ago on a sunday right before a volleyball tourney to carb up. the sunday platter special is ON POINT. the portions are huge. you're likely going to take some home.  the gnocchi was so good and so was the lasagna.  recently, we came and asked our server if gnocchi was available, and he said he would check with the kitchen, and also offered a creamy sauce with it similar to carbonara.  so we said yes, and also ordered a lasagna.   the bussers dropped off cabornara pasta, which all of us remembers never ordering, and we looked at eachother thinking this is not gnocchi. so there goes one seeminlgy petty but disappointing as a simple request where our server did not follow up with us on the gnocchi. if we wanted carbornara, we would've ordered it.    the lasagna, however, was so salty, we could'n't enjoy it. it overpowered the cheese. so when our server FRANK, returned to ask us how everything was, i mentioned genuinly how salty the lasagna was, and with no sympathy, he resonded with, \"we don't add salt.\" well, i've made lasagna before, and obviously most people know the saltiness comes from the sausage/meat and not added salt. but if he was a good listener, he would have picked up that it was more \"salty\" than usual in terms of my palette.  then my dad tried to make light of the situation and made a joke saying, \"maybe the salt was on sale\" and the server just had no sense of humor. it was awful. and so was the lasagna. this is a place we thought we would enjoy, but definately a True disappointment. there are other italian hot spots for less and just as enjoyable with respectable servers.",

By the time our group had walked from the hotel we were at to the restaurant, we had a great table set and ready for us thanks to opentable. Our host was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu an places in general; it was like having a concierge at dinner. What was also nice is we had a strict vegan within our group and they were incredibly kind to go out of their way and make sure everything could suit her needs. Large portions, good wine, and moderately priced food. I think our total was $250. The food was very good, too.",

We had the calamari, seafood pasta and spaghetti with sausage and meatballs.  Seafood pasta had a whole lobster in it.  It was full of calamari, shrimp and clams.  Delicious.  Meatballs were great too.  It was plenty of food for 6 with leftovers.  Tiramasu was a whole cake, delicious.  Impressed.",

After wandering for what seemed like days (but really just hours) around the Forums and all the shops, Trevi provided a refreshing break. Located kind of in the middle of everything, pedestrian traffic flows around the restaurant, so it is a prime people-watching location. The food is first-rate, as would be expected from a Landry's restaurant. The menu obviously has an Italian theme, but enough variation that everyone should find something they like. While it appeared that Trevi does ask for reservations, we had no problem getting seated during the mid-afternoon time. Service was prompt; our waiter very courteous and helpful. We had the Fritto Misto appetizer, a crispy fried medley of shrimp, calamari, scallops and vegetables served with lemon aioli - watch out though; there are fried lemon slices in the mix and they were something of a surprise. Otherwise, excellent fare. It goes well with the La Fiera Pinot Grigio.",

    "text": "I am a Vegas local and brought my family here tonight to enjoy a restaurant that can cater to such a large group.   From the beginning the service wasn't good. The two hostesses greeted us, took our names, & was informed that we had reservations (@ 7:28 pm). After giving our names she gestured for us to wait & told us our reservation wasn't till 7:30 pm & that's when we would be seated. At 7:35 after making eye contact with a member of my party she quickly stopped the \"important\" conversation she was having with her co-worker to let us know we can be seated.   Then the server, (I am really hoping she was just having a bad day), quickly greeted us and rushed us through our drink order. That's what our whole experience was...it felt like it was a hassle for us to be served. Our table consisted of 11 people, 4 being adults and the rest all children under the age of 10. So from the beginning she already had the \"oh great\" mentality. Thankfully our children were very obedient tonight (from what the surrounding tables told us) so she didn't have to do much. But still managed to make us scared to ask for a refill!   But what really killed it for me was being sat near the kitchen and having the doors be see-thru. A man (who I found out was Andy, the manager), reached into a plate of what looked like fried calamari, and took one which he tried to toss it into his mouth, missed, and had it drop... onto the floor!!! He then picked it up and put it back on the plate! I gasped and looked to my husband, he witnessed it as well. I brought it to the other adults attention and they looked on as he took another piece and placed it his mouth right before the server brought it out. After losing our appetites we quickly had our dishes boxed and handed over our money to quickly get out of there. And if you are wondering, yes I still did tip a minimum of 20%  When leaving I went up to the three hostesses (1 male, 2 females) asked the managers name & begin to walk away when the girl in my party called me back. I noticed the hostesses looking at me. They asked me why I asked who he was, after telling them what we saw, they responded in unison,\" okayyyyy!!!So what do you want?\" I turned and left. And that is how my horrible dinner at Carmine's was. So, if you want an over priced, very salty, lack of professionalism, possible dinner off the floor experience Carmine's the place to go.",

    "text": "Ehh. We went into Carmines after walking by it on our way to Trevi in the forum shops (which to start off, I would advise you to go there instead). Seeing that it was family style, we were excited. So we decide to give it a try and our experience was not very good.  They start out by giving you one menu for the table and some cold bread. I wouldn't complain about cold bread, however this bread had some sort of marinara sauce on it, so it was cold crust sauce on cold bread. They also gave out odd pretzel like sticks as well. We look at the pasta dishes and decide to get the \"Ragu\", the most expensive thing on the menu. Meatballs, sausage, and pork. Sounds good! We get the dish and it gets served out...and it was just gross. WAY too much sauce, which is WAY too acidy. Trust me, I have been going to italian places since the 70's when I lived in New York. This sauce was horrible. Maybe the can they used was bad? The meatballs were just that...basic balls of meat. And the sausage was just one long sausage...not even sliced or cooked well. The pork was also weird...just salty skins of pork randomly placed in this garbage pile.  Needless to say after the 4 of us decided we were eating sh*t, we told the waitress and she immediately took our plates and the pasta away. 10 minutes later she hands us the bill, which is for the entire plate of pasta we didn't eat. What?? We ask the manager and she takes the bill in a huff....and returns with the bill with the drinks for about $12. The waitresses advice? Try not to order pasta if you don't want to eat something acidy.   We left a $20 and left and went to Trevi for a real dinner. I'm guessing this place only survives because it is in a tourist trap and most tourists aren't looking for quality food.",

We came here on Saturday with a party of 7 for our nephew's 21st birthday and I can honestly it was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. The service was terrible, and the food mediocre and way over priced; even for the Strip. My husband is a restaurant GM and has previously worked at Italian restaurants in town and he was appalled by the service. We were sat at our table fairly quickly. But it took a solid 20+ minutes for a server to come to just take our drink order and this was AFTER my husband got up and went to the host stand to request service. Our salad came quickly but we waited 40+ minutes for our entrees to arrive. It took so long that our friends were able to take a bag up to their room and come back and the entrees still hadn't arrived. When the food arrived, chicken parm was okay and the meatballs decent but were barely hot. The shrimp fra diavlo on the other hand was terrible. It had no flavor and only minimal sauce. When my in-laws asked for more sauce they were told they could only have bolognese. All in all, this just wasn't worth the $200+ my father in law paid for lunch - save your money and go somewhere else.",

The food is rich, hearty, and the portions are ginormous and done in family style fashion.   APPETIZERS The Fried Calamari is an excellent choice. My group also ordered the Caesar Salad and Mixed Salad. Both were standard. I liked the Caesar, though it had too much dressing for my preference.   ENTREES We ordered several other pasta entrees, but below are the dishes that I tried.  Chicken Scarpariello: Skinlesss chicken thighs and breasts that were well-seasoned and flavorful.   Eggplant Parmigiana: Layers of eggplant, and plenty of gooey mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce.    Shrimp Scampi: These were gone almost in an instant. The garlicky, buttery shrimp was delicious, and they weren't the tiny frozen variety.   DESSERT Titanic:  My group and I sunk the Titanic. This is seriously a massive dessert that requires team effort. Its foundation was a decadent chocolate brownie. On top of that were scoops of ice cream, huge dollops of cream, slices of strawberries and pineapples, a drizzle of chocolate, and a sprinkling of chopped hazelnuts. After we dug in and devoured most of the monstrous dessert, the Titanic resembled the aftermath of the Stay Puft Marshmallow's annihilation in the first Ghostbusters movie.   SERVICE The staff did a great job taking care of my group.   OTHER There are gluten free options available, such as the Pasta Vodka Sauce.  OVERALL The food and service is fantastic, and I'll definitely be returning.",

I also really enjoyed the focaccia bread you get on the side. Decent prices for the strip and everyone felt full and happy when they left. I would stop in again.",

This is definitely a place to take a large group of people who enjoy sharing and don't mind not getting their own dishes.   Carmine's boast their traditional Italian home cooking style- think big families around a table. I would say it's most optimal for a party of 6 or more.   I went with a party of 5 and we got 1 appetizer and 2 main dishes. Luckily my cousin lives in Vegas so she took the leftovers home or otherwise it would have been a waste since I don't want to take it back to the hotel room.   We had the fried zucchini appetizer which really good. It comes as a foot-tall mound of fried zucchini strings. Makes everyone's eyes pop out by the sight of it. The. We had the veal marsala (okay could pass but the mushrooms were cooked well), the special of the day - rack of lamb (cooked well), and the pasta pomadaro (good too).",

    "text": "On November 11, we held a post-wedding ceremony dinner at Carmine's located in The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. We are so happy to say that the evening went perfectly. We worked with Jose Saenz to coordinate for approximately 105 guests who had traveled from Ohio, Michigan and several other states to Las Vegas for our wedding ceremony, and he worked very diligently to ensure every detail was perfect. We reserved the Centrale semi-private dining area, and although it was not fully private, the staff had it arranged in a way that it was not noticeable that other guests were dining in the restaurant. With such a large group in Las Vegas for our \"destination\" wedding, we first contacted Carmine's about two months before our wedding day and were able to coordinate all of the details with Jose in advance. Everything went off without a hitch!  Not only did Jose work extremely hard to make sure all of our requests were fulfilled, the staff working our dinner event was extremely courteous, patient and kind. The best part: the food was DELICIOUS. Our guests loved the menu selections and we can confidently say that everyone left dinner full and happy that evening! We appreciate Jose's patience and hard work to ensure our evening was full of fun for our guests. We will definitely return to Carmine's whenever we have the opportunity to visit Las Vegas and look forward to checking out their other locations as well.",

I brought 20 clients to dine at Carmine's for the evening and they along with myself were extremely pleased with the service we received from Manny (the manager), James Graham (the waiter for the evening), Mingo and Ryan (the two bussers). All of these men were very attentive, warm and welcoming, they listened carefully to the requests of my clients and myself and immediately acted upon them and went above and beyond to make sure everyone had a fabulous dining experience. Sometimes it's very hard to please clients but if you take them to Carmine's they will be impressed with the level of service and food!",

If you are going out with just two people I would skip on this place unless you know you can eat a lot or want a lot of leftovers.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly. I was very happy with the service we received.  We ordered the fried zucchini. Even with four people eating it we ended up with the most leftovers of this. I really liked this dish and was impressed and was better than I thought it would be. I wasn't able to eat a lot because it was a bit on the greasy side and quickly filled me up.  For dinner we ordered the ravioli's and a side of meatballs. We didn't get the actual meatball dish because it came with pasta and we knew we wouldn't be able to eat all that food. I was smart because the pasta would have been too much. I really liked the meatballs. They were really tender and melted in your mouth. I would like to try the pasta next time though.  We opted out of dessert because we were all too full but if you have enough room I'd say go for it because everything I saw looked awesome!  Overall, good just very filling.",

(we are good people like that :)-   Service was ok. Bread was ok. pasta wasn't anything too special. Cesar salad didn't have enough croutons IMHO.  The scrimp was breaded and yummy, we liked that with the angel hair.  We also had penne with bolognese and it was ok, not my choice.

They don't offer the Tugboat smaller dessert anymore so we went for the Titanic and it's GIGANTIC,  but absolutely awesome for a big birthday milestone like 50.

This place is BIG so for the most part you won't have to wait for a table. At first no one came by to ask for drinks or anything so I got up and asked the bartender to order our drinks. When he came by with our drinks he also took our order.  APEROL FIZZ ($7) - surprisingly very good! I didn't know what this drink was but just took a shot in the dark and I really liked it. It has a slight carbonation and it was a refreshing drink.  MUSSELS IN RED SAUCE ($9) - a very visually appealing dish. The mussels were good and I liked the sauce that they were in.  GARLIC BREAD PARM ($6) - admittedly not the most visually appealing dish but the garlic bread was delicious and I really liked the melted part on top. Girlfriend wasn't a fan of the cheese so she took it off but we agreed the garlic bread was really good.  FRIED CALAMARI ($11) - my favorite of the dishes. The calamari was very good but I was a huge fan of the dipping sauce. You could tell that it was homemade and it had a ton of flavor.   They have a ton of pasta options that were served in big portions and sounded delicious but unfortunately were not part of the happy hour menu. I do want to come back and try some of them though.",

The drinks (including the Shirley Temple martini Joseph made for me from the initial drink), the atmosphere, and the staff were all excellent, and we will continue to go back there when shopping at the Forums!",

Ordered a $35 dish that I was unable to eat because I am pregnant (which I explained to the waiter) and asked for some plain noodles which I knew I could tolerate. We waited 20 minutes for the first dish to be brought out, then after I couldn't tolerate it, I had to wait another 20 minutes for plain pasta. At that point I asked for it to go, as I am in my first trimester of pregnancy and very sick by the food I was originally presented with. My husband asks for the bill, which I review and find both the first item which I couldn't tolerate, and the replacement pasta that came 20 minutes late. I spoke with the manager who had no care or concern for the fact that I was charged for two meals, neither of which I could even eat. Such a poorly run establishment. I understand that places need to make money, however there is such a thing a customer service and this place absolutely has NONE.",

The restaurant is large, open, and beautiful bottles on display at the bar area where we sat.  The whole ambiance and food was very True to their style!  They even serve wine in little table glasses.  Kelly was our bartender, she was super nice and had great conversation!   We split a Caesar salad, the lettuce was crisp and the salad was dressed to perfection.  Then we shared a bolognese with rigatoni noodles, we looovveed it!! Definitely want to come back and try to hit their happy hour at the bar.    Thanks Carmine's!",

    "text": "This is absolutely a great place for dining with an empty stomach. And when I say empty please do fast 12 hours prior to coming because the plates are ginormous served with heaping mound of food. If you've never been here don't forget to bring your mom, dad, sister, brother, heck the entire town while you're at it. You'll still have enough leftovers to take home with you.   They'll start you off with bread. Ask them for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar because they don't just give it. Look up on the wall and you'll find a brightly lit marquee, which has the full menu. Great idea to save money on menus & trees, bad idea for people with poor eye sight. I just pulled up the menu on my phone. No biggie. You can pick any type of pasta and any sauce to your liking and they will gladly make it.   With just a party of three we had an appetizer and one entree for sharing. It was more than enough to be extremely full and to have leftovers.  For the appetizer we had the meat stuffed mushrooms, which were amazing. Tasted like a juicy meatball on top of a mushroom.  For the entree we opted for the linguini with bolognese sauce. The noodles were al dente and the thick meaty sauce was just perfect. On the table there's shaved Parmesan. Don't forget to add that to everything!  Overall great flavor, awesome service, cool ambiance, and the pricing is just right.   Tip: Do make reservations on holidays & weekend dinners. Lunch time during the week seems to have plenty of open seating.  Sit at the bar if you're coming in for a quick \"small bite\" (really it's normal portion-sized). They have great HH.",

There were four of us and we probably could have made an entire meal out of that bread.  It was Delish!  The food comes out Family Style and so we ordered a porterhouse and some pasta.  It was fantastic.  The ambiance was awesome and the wait staff rivaled any I have seen.  Talk about well trained and on top of business.  I was really impressed.    Carmine's is very clean, not too crowded, and VERY Italian.  It reminded me of a Brooklyn eatery from back in the day, as I imagine they were.  The food was professionally done, but if you don't pay attention, you might think it came from Grandma's kitchen.    Carmine's is not cheap, but it is really good food.  Give them a try!",

I liked the basic decor that makes you feel like you're at a nonna's kitchen. The menu is projected alongside a wall. This was nifty, because it allowed us to easily collaborate on what to order rather than holler over our menus.  For a party of 8, the waiter suggested that we order 2 appetizers and 3 entrees. We took him up on his recommendation, but this ended up being way more food than we actually needed. Either the portions are over the top or our eyes were bigger than our stomach. Everything was delicious, however. We had the calamari and eggplant parm as the appetizers, and then we had spaghetti and meatballs, manicotti, and some type of rigatoni as the main entrees. The appetizers were the most memorable to me out of everything we ate. The calamari had a nice light batter, and the eggplant parm was like a lasagna with layers and layers of stacked eggplant pieces. The meatballs in the spaghetti were huge!   Overall I enjoyed the meal at Carmine's. The food is comforting and plentiful.",

I just feel like if I wanted a show, I wouldn't have gone here.",

    "text": "GF and i stopped in during happy hour and sat at one of the bar high tables for a quick bite. Great selection of authentic, family style Italian cuisine. Ambiance is great, especially being located in the busy shopping area of Caesar's.  Reasons for my mediocre 3-star review:   slow service...there were two other tables besides ours, and we waited 10min til we were asked if we wanted something to drink...another 12min til we could order our food...then over 20 til we started eating. (during busy hour, that wouldn't be bad...but there was only 5 tables seated in the whole restaurant at the time)  and the other thing that bugged me...ordered a hot sandwich (which was great...and huge!!) but i asked if my GF could have a little side plate of spaghetti w/ marinara instead of the side salad, but was immediately and definitely shut down. not a 'oh, let me see what i can do' or a 'that will be a $$ upcharge' etc etc. just a flat outright NO. c'mon, we're only two people and don't want to order a family size boatload of spaghetti just to try it. pretty sure that could have been arranged.   anyways, i'd caution any small parties from going in...will be hard to find appropriate sized dishes to order. but for larger groups who are open to sharing dishes family style, this would be fantastic",

    "text": "We ventured down to the forum to meet family visiting from out of the country. I was a little nervous about family style and it worked out perfectly.   Martin was our server and he is a delight with fantastic knowledge of food and wine. His recommendations proved success.   We indulged in a bottle of Barolo and then a featured Piemonte. $78, $52 respectively which yes is pricey for those and you can't easily get these plus it's a big name establishment AND you're on the strip so for me elevated price is expected.   We ordered 2 dishes for 4 of us and no appetizer for fear of being too full seeing how large the portions were. I have to say the prices alone for the food are very reasonable because of the quantity. The lemon veal was delicious as long as you enjoy pounded floured veal. I loved it! We also got the mixed seafood penne with white (oil and garlic) as opposed to marinara sauce. There was a mix of clams mussels  calamari shrimp and lobster tossed in oil garlic and penne pasta. It was fresh flavorful and generous. The only challenge was not having small lobster forks to help with cracking the shells. Once we asked a couple waiters they finally found one for us but not before my husbands shirt was already splattered in oil from trying to use his hands.   We indulged in tiramisu because it was too pretty to pass up seeing it on the table next door and of course because it's tiramisu.   Overall I think this place is stellar. Our guests stated that this was their new go to for Italian when they visit the states.",

    "text": "My boyfriend an I have visited the Carmine's in NY last year and absolutely loved it! So I was excited to find out that there was a location here in Vegas. For our 3rd anniversary we decided to go to Carmine's because we love the cosmos and fried calamari we had at the NY location. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked if they did anything special for anniversaries, which they confirmed by phone that they did. So he informed them that it was going to be our anniversary so it would be amazing if they could do something small to make it special.  While the food was good, all I can say is that my boyfriend and I were very unhappy with our service. We have never felt so uncomfortable with a server before and we will not be returning. Frankly, it made our anniversary much less special. Our waitress had a bad attitude and when she messed up our order and brought us fried zucchini instead, we nicely informed her of the mistake and asked for our calamari we ordered. Instead, she blamed us for the mistake and argued with us saying she was sure we had ordered the zucchini: \"I'm sure you definitely said fried zucchini!\" After this debacle, we could see her huffing and puffing, point at us to her co-workers and complaining that we had told her the wrong order and it was our fault. When the calamari came, she stopped by and asked \"Did we mess it up this time too?\" and waited staring at us. I was a bit worried about eating it in case she was one of those servers who spits in the food. But we sucked it up and tried to hurry and get out of there so we could salvage what was left of our night. After we paid our check were on our way out, she called out \"Happy Anniversary!\"  And just when we thought it couldn't get worse.... our leftovers came with a nice blanket of salt we didn't ask for. In conclusion, if you want to pay an arm and a leg for good food and get treated like trash, then welcome to Carmine's.",

One tip I would give you is to request for them not to place you in the front. If you do, you will have people waiting to eat staring at you like you are in a fish bowl. The food might be some of the best Italian food I have ever had. The location is in an amazing spot, the price is still reasonable and not out of hand.   What kept me from going this place 5 stars was the service. I don't the service I received was not the best. I wish I remembered her name. I don't know if it was the number of people in there, but I expect good service no matter what. Plus some of us got our food 10 mins after others, That was not cool.",

I typically enjoy dipping with bread and that wasn't even enjoyable.   We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed rushed even though it wasn't super busy. He messed up our bill, bar was sticky seemed like it had been a while since it was cleaned. I did enjoy their Carmines Pinot Grigio! Well priced.   I might return for the eggplant and vino!",

The bar area is nice, sit there for a cocktail before your meal or dine at one of the few high tops for minimal wait times.  Favorite dishes include the meatballs- huge and delicious mix of beef and veal, these are a must order! The seafood salad is also solid, decoratively served with fresh baby endive and plenty of octopus. Anything with fresh mozzarella is always a win, too. The main pasta dishes feature your choice of pasta and sauce- the penne and red sauce was fine, neither the sauce nor pasta really wowed me but they were cooked perfectly al dente, pasta is fresh made in house daily. I wish they had a mushroom pappardelle option.   I did not care for the tiramisu dessert (minimal lady fingers, mostly mascarpone) or the  cold eggplant salad dish we received. I would come back for the eggplant parmigiana, shrimp scampi, and chicken scarpariello dishes.   NOTE: Prices are not available on website menu, use Yelp photos- and don't freak out, everything is served family style, portions are ample for sharing with a group (~4).",

    "text": "Items Selected: Bread Basket - Focaccia, Rye, Tomato and Herb, Rustic Italian Cold Antipasto Platter - Mortadella, Prosciutto, Eggplant Caponata, Salmon Crostini, Seafood Salad, Mixed Olives, Panini and More Spicy Scarpariello Wings Eggplant Parmigiana Lasagna Double Espresso on Ice Bread Pudding Strawberry Shortcake Chocolate Cannoli  Opened in the Forum Shops at Caesars' by Artie Cutler and the team behind two New York City locations, one in Atlantic City, DC and even the Bahamas, Carmine's is cut from the same Southern-Italy-by-way-of-NYC cloth as chains such as Bucca di Beppo or Maggiano's Little Italy, yet by doing 'the little things' right the experience is upgraded at least two-fold while still maintaining its customer-friendly prices.  Assuredly a tourist gathering point, though a fair share of locals have been heard to say they enjoyed their visits, Carmine's Las Vegas location opened in Summer of 2013 and closing in on three years with Chef Michael Ingino involved since doors opened the very concept of a \"scratch kitchen\" feeding a room that seats up to eight hundred from 11:00AM to 11:00PM weekdays (and till Midnight on weekends) may seem exhausting, but in reality the attitude of everyone in the place remains not only pleasant but downright exuberant.  Currently managed by Anthony Esparza, a pleasant man whose enthusiasm for a big job seems contagious to his staff, it was as part of a party of four that seats were taken under one of the colossal menus mounted amidst black & white photos not dissimilar to any number of Italian-American restaurants and with portions as outsized as the restaurant's character the phrase \"Family Style\" rings True from the onset, our waiter warning that each plate was meant to serve anywhere from \"two to four\" guests.  Skipping the grandeur of a place like Carbone, casting aside stereotyped Italian phrases and an absurd check in favor of a sort of \"Sunday at Grandma's\" vibe, feasting at Carmine's commences with an ample Bread Basket likely to tempt all but the most carbohydrate conscious and with Sinatra, Dean and Sammy playing overhead in not-too-loud fashion the question of where best to begin is a daunting one, the fact that nearly everything but Pasta and imported Charcuterie is made on-site further complicating the decision.  Acknowledging from the start that over-ordering at Carmine's is a virtual guarantee, \"two to four\" better translated as \"four or more,\" it was to a large platter of Antipasti that the table was soon treated and although the phrase \"something for everyone\" is often a dicey proposition it would be difficult to call the smorgasbord anything less as everything from simple meats and cheese to a complex seafood salad are presented elegantly with a price not dissimilar to what such a spread would cost from Whole Foods Market.  Told that the Spicy Scarpariello Wings were something crave-worthy, two dozen plump pieces of Chicken cooked crisp before a bath in vibrant sauce teaming with garlic, lemon and peppers, suffice it t say that the housemade Blue Cheese Dressing alone would make this plate worth ordering instead of lesser versions at the local Sports Bar, a followup of Lasagna and Eggplant Ptarmigan showing the former to not be quite as crisp as one might hope across the top while the 9-layered latter outperforms any other version in town by a significant degree as each hand-sliced and stacked piece is baked soft without turning mushy around what could easily be a pound or more of Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella Cheese.  Joking with the server about his description of Strawberry Shortcake, the desserts all tempting but that one sounding particularly odd when accidentally described as being served on Rye, it was in good humor that the actual dish was served complimentary alongside a block of Cinnamon and Chocolate Bread with fresh Whipped Cream and three filled-to-order Cannolis, the Bread Pudding actually almost *too*dense at the end of such a meal while Marble Cake beneath Cream and Strawberries was soft and light, the citrus-tinged Mascarpone filling each Chocolate-dipped Shell equally convincing of Carmine's commitment to quality.  **** Accounting for the fact that Carmine's is positioned to compete for the 'average' tourist dollars and not those looking for an 'event' meal or fine dining there is little doubt that what Michael, Anthony and their team is doing at Carmine's goes a step beyond to make the overall experience a worthwhile outing, and one that tourists as well as locals may equally be likely to enjoy.",

We followed that up with a classic: spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were delicious! You could tell they were freshly made and even though we were pretty full from the salad we made room to eat all six! The sauce was just what you'd expect from a good Italian restaurant and the pasta was cooked to perfection too.  I wish they'd open one up in Austin which needs a good Italian restaurant like this!",

But one piece of warning I would not go hear if you are dining by yourself. That could get pricey and well entirely too much food. At this place they serve family style. Meaning everything you order in huge and intended for sharing. My wife and I had Lasagna and it was fantastic. The best part is because sharing is assumed you can get a decent meal here for around $40-$50. Any time we see a show in Caesars moving forward we will dine here. The food is great and it sure beats spending $70-$80 somewhere else.",

We have grown quite large and size and needed a venue that could accommodate 150 sisters. Carmine's can host that many plus lots more.  Second, we were on a tight budget and Cassy, the special events manager, was able to put together a family style menu that that would accommodate almost all special diets. When planning for this many people it is difficult to make sure all diets are met and Cassy nailed it all making sure there was food that almost anyone with certain diets could eat.  Third, the day of any event is always quite stressful and the staff - especially one server in particular Micheal - went above and beyond to make every lady in the house felt special! Even the smallest request was handle with a smile and he even put on a show for the group and sang a song in Italian. Just a few other highlights: the food was absolutely delicious. The decor was elegant making decorating so easy with only really needing center pieces for the tables. But my favorite part is that the staff boxed up all the uneaten food and we were able to donate this to local shelter! If you are looking for a place to host your next special occasion this should certainly be on the list of places to consider.",

We started with the calamari appetizer ($28) and the most amazing garlic bread covered with generous portion of cheese. For our entree we ordered the lasagne ($38) that was light and fluffy with a rich tomato flavor, the best I have ever had. This would easily have fed a group of six. Our waiter, Mark, was wonderful. He was very informative with all of our questions and very attentive. Everyone was really nice. The ambience is really cool with high ceilings and framed pictures hung on the walls.

I have always wanted to try Carmine's when I have been to NYC, but for some reason (probably the extremely long wait for a table), have never been. Since a lot of iconic NY eateries have made their mark on Vegas though, I have been able to try some of these hard-to-get spots, including Carmine's. We started with a delicious green salad, ordered from the \"bar\" menu at the suggestion of our server, as that size is a bit smaller and more appropriate for a duo like my husband and I. I ordered a delicious drink that I would love to replicate at home - it had lime, lemon juice, and blood orange, but was amazingly fresh and crisp! Our main was the chicken parmesan, which was delicious, cheesy, and crunchy. You order the pasta separately for around $12 to complete the meal and I would say you need it - the tomato sauce the meal comes with is super fresh and simple, the way I like it. The bread served here was pretty good, too. I was a fan of the awesome tomato focaccia bread, yum! Too bad we were stuffed, otherwise the dessert menu here looks really good. And if you're in a large group, the calamari looked divine, but would be a heap of food for two.  Our server was really nice, not attitude-y at all, and helpful in accommodating our small party. My Sicilian family would love this place! Very kitschy decor, a la Dolce Vita. I would definitely recommend Carmine's for a group.",

I arrived late after they ordered, which is no big deal but we didn't get our food for an hour and 15 minutes. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!! Which, I get ticket times can get out of hand, but come up to the table and apologize at least. We asked our server for the manager, a 30ish year old black man who came to the table and didn't say sorry at all but decided to cast the blame on me because I apparently wanted all the food to come out at once. Excuse me, I wasn't even present when they ordered! And he preceded to embarrass me in front of all these men I just met. Needless to say, I was shocked but I pulled him aside to tell him how patronizing and belittling he made me feel and set him straight that I wasn't even there when they ordered so his lame excuse as to why our food took forever wasn't even accurate and was a bit pathetic to blame the only girl at the table-- sexist.   Anyways, he told our table he would take care of some of the bill. We ate the mediocre and cold food and waited for the bill, which the host gave us. We realized nothing was taken off as previously promised. Upset, we asked for the manager again to discuss the matter and the host proceeded to call security on us. So uncalled for and rude. I will NEVER eat there again, and all of us agree that this place is utterly terrible and completely unprofessional. I hope they shut down because there are so many better places to eat in Las Vegas who actually know how to give customer service! Stay away, far away!  P.S. All the guys were mad they didn't have alfredo sauce... And they're an Italian restaurant.... Unheard of!",

We asked for bread and the waitress literally gave us the bread as soon as we got our food, and the bread sucked.  The meat balls were very mushy and were very bland. Would highly recommend not coming to this establishment.",

The sauce was light and left the linguine dry underneath.   The Caesars salad had delicious fresh croutons but at $30 I would  expect exceptional parmesan but it was really low quality cheese.  The dressing was very heavy in garlic and anchovies. We specifically asked if it was fishy and we were assured it was not. But it was too fishy for my taste and I couldn't eat it   The chocolate torte for desert was good.   The food is sold family style. The cost per person is higher than Cheesecake Factory down the mall which in my opinion has much better food.   Take out service was ok. We had questions about ingredients that the guy couldn't answer.  They didn't give us enough plates and plastic-ware  If you're really desperate for bad Italian food Olive Garden, buca di pepo , macaroni grill all have better food at a lower price.",

When the high chair was delivered to us the seat fastner was broken. I brought it to the attention of the staff member seeing this and she promptly brought me out a another chair to replace the broken one. Unfortunately, the highchair that she brought me out was also broken and the seat strap unusable. When I brought to her attention she simply shrugged at me and said \"I don't know\" and walked away. So, not so good on the server-side.  Aside from that mishap, the food was The food was good.  We had the porterhouse which came to my delight covered in garlic and olive oil absolutely phenomenal.  We also ordered the angel hair with oil and garlic and chicken Big mistake the chicken was dry as the Las Vegas desert we are surrounded by.  When it comes to lasagna, I'm afraid the lasagna leaves much to be desired.  It falls apart easily as you're cutting it and it's nearly impossible to serve without dropping back into the plate or onto the table.   These things combined with the fact of the lasagna is very bland and has almost no original taste of it's own. It seems it inherently flavor from the sauce surrounding it. Both the Ricota filing and the meat sauce used to build the layers I'm afraid need a little more work.",

Calamari for appetizer, Garlic and oil linguine, Sausage and broccoli rigatoni, Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Scaloppine w/lemon and butter.  We still had food leftover!   I was most surprised by the garlic and oil linguine. You would think that the pasta would be very light or plain in flavor, but it wasn't. Quite the opposite. It was incredibly flavorful without the heaviness of say a cream sauce.   Also,  I never order chicken dishes when I'm out for some reason. Especially dishes with chicken breast, mostly because I've never found a dish that I've liked, that wasn't bland or tough or just uninteresting with some sauce slopped on it. The chicken scaloppine was so tender, with the most delicious creamy, lemon butter sauce that had a refreshing delightful flavor.  Casual, family style ambience. I felt like I was dining at a good old Italian friends house for dinner. Big appetite is a must!  Had a great dinner with friends from out-of-town,  and it was a fun filled satisfying evening.",

    "text": "Just as good as the New York location, but not *nearly* as crowded!   We made reservations for three for an early Friday night dinner, but I don't think the reservations were necessary. The restaurant got busy, but it definitely never got as busy as the restaurant in Times Square.  The staff was all friendly, and took the time to joke around with us. Our waiter recommended some drinks, and then gave us time to decide on our order.  I've been dreaming about Carmine's Bolognese since we had it in March, so of course that was the sauce that I wanted. We agreed on a pasta type and an appetizer (the calamari) and then stared at the bread basket that they placed on the table in front of us.  We'd all been to Carmine's New York location before, so we knew from experience that there'd be a ton of food coming our way, and were weighing the pros and cons of eating the bread ahead of our meal. We nibbled at the bread, but decided to save our appetites for the food.  And, oh! That food! That glorious, delicious, exceedingly large portion of food!  The calamari came out first, and initially, we thought we'd have no problem polishing it off. There were three of us, after all, and we were all pretty hungry. The calamari was delicious - crispy and piping hot, there was good flavor in both the batter and in the squid meat. I didn't try the marinara sauce, but the others seemed to love it. I preferred throwing a dusting of parmesan cheese on top, which made it even better.  As we were putting a dent into the platter of calamari, our waiter came by with our platter of Angel Hair pasta with Bolognese sauce. He then started to dish it all out for us, and for some reason, I ended up with the largest serving.   Maybe because I clapped and bounced up and down in my seat when he set it down on the table?  The sauce was just as good as I remembered it being, which was a huge relief. I tend to have very bad luck with things that I've experienced once, and end up craving. They never quite add up, you know? But, that wasn't the case here. The sauce was meaty and mildly spicy, without being too tomato-y. Is that a word? Tomato-y? It is now.  It wasn't long before we realized, not only had we failed in clearing out the calamari, there was a not-so-small portion of pasta left over. As we were all in hotel rooms without microwaves, we weren't sure we wanted to take the leftovers with us, but then decided to see if we could find someone...in need...to give it to.  I'm so glad that we found out about this location before our trip to Vegas. It was the perfect pre-race meal, and we loved everything from the service to the quality of the food.   Once again, we left overly full and impressed by Carmine's!",

The tomahawk steak was very good. It was well seasoned and even I, who hates steak, ate 3 giant pieces!   Next we had the seafood pasta which was ok. Half of our table got sick to our stomach with just one bite of the clam. The noodle and sauce tasted good though.",

    "text": "The best Italian food in Las Vegas by way of NYC. And the best porterhouse steak in Las Vegas as well. Carmines is a family style restaurant hence the high prices. But one entre' is enough for three people.  The seafood here is also the best you will find in this city.  Ask anyone from Maine how the lobster is here and they'll tell you \" outstanding\"! The Vegas location offers bar portions too for those sitting solo or who just want a smaller dish. Not all owns are available in this size though. Don't bother with any other Italian restaurants in Vegas..... Just go here. Great place to go too solo since 95% of the places here expect a solo diner to go to Burger King. Carmine's will never forgot your sitting there.",

We ended up sitting in the bar area which serves smaller portions (only for 3 people) but the menu is more restricted. The prices seem high but when you consider how much food is served they actually become very reasonable.  We ordered the Caesar salad and penne bolognaise, the food was so rich and there was so much of it that we ended up taking the final third of the bolognaise to eat the next day. I would definitely recommend Carmine's to anyone in search of a good quality hearty meal in Las Vegas.",

I have mixed reviews.  For the incredibly high prices we paid for pasta, it's not worth it.  I went with a group of ten people and we ordered: Lasagna:  good but nothing to rave about Meatballs:  Wow...you call these meatballs?  Not very good at all Chicken Parmesan:  Actually quite good and the best item we ordered. Chicken Scarpariello:  Not much flavor, sausage was good. Rigatoni Pomodoro:  heavy basil sauce, tasty but not worth paying $35 for a huge bowl of $4 pasta.  We didn't order desserts since we were full from our entrees.  Portions are huge but what's the point of having huge portions of just average food?  How about focusing on quality instead?  Service was excellent except for one waiter who kept on hovering around our table after we were finished, almost as if he were trying to rush us out even though there wasn't anyone waiting to be seated.  Would I go back?  No way.",

From what I can tell they did a pretty good job of faithfully recreating the look and feel of the New York location. We arrived fairly late into the evening so things were very quiet inside which was actually kind of nice. If you're unaware, Carmine's is a family style restaurant which means the portions are HUGE because it's intended for you to share with others at your table. I ordered their chicken parmesan and my wife decided to go with their basic spaghetti. Both were pretty good! They're a few steps above a chain in terms of quality. With the massive portions and the above average taste I think this equals a solid effort. We'd definitely go back the next time we're out in Vegas.",

I went to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday with my girl and we made a reservation.  We got there on time for our reservation and they turned us away telling us that the kitchen was closed.  I ended up eating at a place called DJs Tacos (you should stop by there if you haven't).  We went back though, told the manager what happened and he was great about making it up to us.  Free wine, free birthday cheesecake, and of course the food was delicious.  Definitely will go back when I'm in Vegas again.",

They have these oversized shot glasses for your water, which I thought was odd but maybe it is to prevent spilling when patrons reach across the table to get more food.
