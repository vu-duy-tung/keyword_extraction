    "text": "A return visit to Emeril's courtesy of Spring Restaurant Week 2013.  Their menu sounded interestingly enough as this one restaurant ended up being our only visit during RW.  What makes their RW menu a bit different from others is that they were offering a four course meal for $50.13 versus a three course.  We arrived on a Wednesday with reservations in hand.  This was a good thing because they were especially busy this night with lots of events going on at MGM.  We were advised that service would take longer than usual because of how busy things were.  We appreciated the upfront warning.  Our menu choices:  * Heirloom Tomato Salad \"Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil and Aged Balsamic\" - A bit disappointing.  The tomatoes were rather mushy, as in possibly overripe.  We usually love heirloom tomatoes, but we weren't loving this one.  * Cold Smoked Salmon Tartare \"Crispy Flatbread, Whole Grain Mustard Aioli and Watercress\" - I'm afraid to say this, but it was underseasoned.  Yes, that's right.  Even with the freshly ground pepper, it just was blah.  I had to add salt and more pepper to wake up the dish.  The aioli was minimal, so it didn't really do much to enhance the fish at all.  * Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder \"Apple Wood Smoked Bacon & Potato\" - This soup was rich, hearty, and very flavorful.  It was one really good bowl of clam chowder soup.  * Chicken, Shrimp, & Andouille Gumbo \"Long Grain Rice & Shaved Green Onion\" - This was some pretty good gumbo.  It had so much going on in terms of yummy goodness and a deep developed flavor.  We were very impressed.  (We recently had gumbo at another fine dining establishment and let's say their version does not come close to Emeril's.)  * Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop \"Chive & Potato Puree, Fresh Pea Tendrils and Toy Box Charm Tomatoes\" - This was a very generous portion of protein after our first two dishes. It had a very tasty crust and probably should have been enjoyed during this seating.  It was just too much for myself and I had to take the rest to go.  The Husband made the mistake of eating the whole thing and couldn't eat much dessert after.  (His loss.)  The fresh pea tendrils literally looks like they just cut it from the garden.  It doesn't really do much to the dish beyond adding color.  * New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - I normally don't  order bread pudding but theirs is pretty good.  I was already so stuffed but couldn't stop eating it.  * Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - Another dessert that I don't usually choose, but it's pretty good too!  It was fluffy and creamy, not overly chunky or heavy.  I think that's what we both liked - two desserts that we don't normally like but really enjoyed here.  Service was good overall.  Water glasses were filled and the staff were constantly moving.  Sure, there were some hit and misses throughout our meal, but it started off weak and built itself up and ended strong.  In the future, I know that their starters aren't their strongest suit.",

    "text": "All over Vegas you will find restaurants attached to celebrity chefs for every type of food. Some are wonderful. Unfortunately, many are not. Emerils Fish House falls in that second category.   Let's start with the good. We had wonderful service. A team of three servers worked with us to ensure we would make our show.   The food was the problem.  We ordered the New Orleans shrimp and crab cake to share as appetizers.   The shrimp was weak for something that should have been spectacular. Compared to Dickie B's in NOLA it was embarrassing. To top it off, It was lukewarm in temperature.   The crab cake was cold. Immediately, they took it back and brought a hot replacement. It had wonderful lump crab meat. Other than that, it tasted average at best. Not your typical crab cake.   We split a Caesar salad. It was a romaine heart cut in half. A quarter of my end was the core - inedible. Not very good.  For our main course my lady had fresh fish. Wasn't impressed. I had pasta that had no taste.   Had wine by the glass. Average.   There are so many choices in Vegas. Go somewhere else.",

It wasn't dry and it was still warm when we received it. I had Sea Scallops and Clams with herb gnocchi, and it was to die for. The garlic cream sauce on top was the perfect complement, and I found myself using the Scallops and clams to scoop up the sauce. My fiance had the Texas Red Fish, and he loved it as well. He said it had really good flavor and was fresh. We had the Chocolate Guniess  Cake as dessert and it was good as well. The cake was a bit dry, but the frosting was moist. Also, the service is top notch here. We had a two different servers working together during our meal, and it was wonderful. They were very in sync and we barely had to wait for anything. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "Spring Restaurant Week 2013.  Our meal for the evening:  Heirloom Tomato Salad Cold Smoked Salmon Tartar Sweet Corn Bisque Emeril's BBQ Salmon Horseradish Grilled Blue Shrimp Emeril's Banana Cream Pie  What did we love about our night here?  The service. They were going to place us on a tiny two-seater table (I know, restaurants like to use every chair efficiently). But when we requested the spacious booth close by, they gladly gave it to us, even though that booth could've seated a party of four. Our meal from beginning to end was served pretty flawlessly. Waters were filled, crumbs were discreetly brushed away, & I'm not sure I ever noticed this before, but each of our courses were placed in front of us individually. What I mean is when our course arrived, it was brought to us by two servers, and placed down at the exact same time. Not just one server bringing both our dishes one by one. I'm imagining that maybe very fine dining restaurants will do this, but I thought it was a nice touch.   What did we think was just A-OK? The food. Everything was cooked accordingly, it's just nothing really wowed us. I could chalk it up to the fact that we don't eat much Louisiana-creole food. Maybe we can't appreciate it as much.  The desserts were the highlight of our meal. Emeril's Banana Cream Pie is to die for. I can't pass up eating this whenever I eat at any of Emeril's restaurants. The flourless chocolate cake was a bit too dark for me at first bite, then I had another with the cherry compote... YUM! Before we knew it, the cake was gone.  Overall, we had a great dinner. Would I return? Probably not, especially since I enjoy Emeril's menus at his other establishments much more.",

    "text": "Where's the Bam!?! This was my first time dining in any of Emeril's restaurants so needless to say I had high hopes for being blown away with flavor. We figured what better time to try We came in on Wednesday during restaurant week. Like the smart people we are, we made reservations for an off time 9PM and were rewarded with quick seating at an awesome table near the servers desk (sense the sarcasm?)  It's funny you figure since we were close to the servers desk that we would not have to worry about flagging down or look for our waitress but sadly that wasn't the case.  A little tip for the wait staff: you shouldn't talk crap about your tables or guests in front of the other guests. While it was entertaining, it's unprofessional.   Food:  We ordered off of the restaurant week menu.   The shining dish of our dining experience was the pretzel bread! WOW I've had pretzel bread from other places but damn! this one is a winner! Salty hard pretzel exterior and soft bead guts. I asked them for at least 4 of these bad boys! 5* on the free bread!  Our menu selections: Romaine hearts ceasar salad This dish honestly failed to wow me in any way it felt like a lazy salad idea as it was plated with 3 romaine spears with cheese and dressing. I would've have preferred a \"normal\" ceasar salad over this version.   Clam Chowder Emeril's version of clam chowder was decent but didn't have any zing or \"bam!\" as the man himself would say. I could tell that the clams used were fresh as there was a bit of sand and grit at the bottom of my bowl (this is a good thing)  Horseradish blue shrimp w/ cous cous and cauliflower. This sounded awesome on the menu but sadly it did not come close to what was advertised. The shrimp was overcooked and were almost rubbery enough that you could bounce them like a basketball. Seasoning? There was not a single hint of horseradish to be found on the plate! I will say that the cous cous served were very interesting. they were light and fluffy and had a tobiko (fish egg) like texture to it. It's sad when that was the most memorable part of any of the dishes I ordered.  BBQ Salmon I know I should've ordered this instead. A nice quality slice of fish with a hint of bbq marinade and smoke in the meat however I wish that they let the heavy coat of BBQ sauce caramelize a bit before serving it because by just slathering a coat on before it's served cheapens the dish up. It was the better of the 2 main entree's that we ordered.   Flour-less Chocolate Cake: I respect an establishment that has yummies for the anti-gluten patrons. I am pro-gluten and pro-chocolate so sacrifices had to be made... Not a bad little chocolate cake, it could almost pass as a \"normal\" dry chocolate cake if I didn't know beforehand.  All in all, I would be lying if I said I would recommend this place to dine. For a mid-high end resort restaurant with a name brand chef's name attached to it I would expect better. None of the dishes had any sense of seasoning or beloved BAM in it that you would come to expect from Emeril and the only good thing that was memorable was the pretzel bread.... The Man himself needs to come to his restaurant before they have to recruit Robert Irvine to save this place....",

    "text": "A few dishes warrant three stars, but the majority? Meh.  On our fourth day of Restaurant Week, we dined at Emeril's Fish House. It's one of the few restaurants I've never experienced at MGM Grand. We had 6 o'clock reservations and we were seated promptly. All three of us chose the Restaurant Week menu for $50.13. We started with salads: the Heirloom Tomato Salad - Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil, Herb Vinaigrette and Aged Balsamic Vinegar and the Caesar Salad - Romaine Hearts, Parmesan Cheese, Roasted Garlic Grissini and Creamy House Made Dressing. The tomatoes weren't as hearty as we'd hope, but the blue cheese was high octane and really stellar. I had hoped the Caesar house dressing would be like what's offered at Delmonico. Unfortunately, it wasn't. This romaine was overdressed and the dressing was too sweet for my liking.   Our second course was Shrimp & Andouille Pork Sausage Gumbo - Okra & Long Grain Rice and Chef Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder - Apple Smoked Bacon & Idaho Potatoes. I was torn between the two but went with the Gumbo since we were in Emeril's house. The chowder, however, was the better choice. It was velvety and the clams were perfectly tender. The Gumbo lacked \"Bam!\" it was really mild. Though, not overly salty like many I tried in New Orleans.   We sampled each of the options for the third course: Horseradish Grilled Blue Shrimp - Patty pan Squash, Zucchini & Pearl Couscous and Preserved Meyer Lemon, Chef Emeril's Sweet Barbecued Atlantic Salmon - Spicy Andouille Pork Sausage Hash, Crystal Fried Onion Crust and Emeril's House made Worcestershire and Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop - Chive Blossom & Yukon Gold Potato Puree, and Wilted Spinach.  The shrimp was the winning dish. It was well seasoned and not a bit overcooked. I wish I had ordered it, instead I had the BBQ Salmon. I ordered it since \"fish house\" is in the name and I've never had salmon barbequed. In short, I was very underwhelmed. It was underseasoned and lacked pizazz. The sweetness hid the natural salmon flavor. The hash was so overly salty I couldn't eat it. The double cut pork chop was prepared medium. It was cooked to order, but it was tough! And also terribly bland. Yet, the spinach was so salty it was inedible.   I welcomed dessert and when it was delivered our server said \"and now, for the best part!\" Sadly, it was the best part. The didn't have the Lemon & Angel Food Cake Trifle that was posted online. So, I decided to give Emeril's Banana Cream Pie another chance. I had it before at Delmonico and it was served frozen. Thankfully, this was one was ice crystal free. It seemed to have more cream than banana; it was nothing I'd rave about or even order again, but it was pretty good. The guys chose the butter and bread pudding. This was the highlight of the night. Tender, gooey bread, and slightly sweet.   Service was attentive. However, I found dinner service a bit odd. Each course was brought out on an enormous tray with each dish covered and then placed on a stand. The covers were removed and then the food would sit until a few servers could gather to serve all dishes at the same time. It looked like a parade of room service, then you see the food sitting there and you're left thinking \"serve it to me or I'll serve it to myself.\" I don't know if it was amplified because we sat at the table next to their prepping area - we saw this process for every diner in our back corner of the room. I can't recall ever paying such attention to the manner in which food was served. I was annoyed with the distraction.   We were on such a roll with our Restaurant Week meals I knew it was too good to last. At least, we helped out Three Square. Emeril's Fish House is a one and done experience. Frankly, it is sad that this place remains but Seablue was replaced. They had stellar seafood. I miss it.",

The service in this place is very attentive, wish they were the same on the meals they are dishing out.  For starters we tried the Calamari, short ribs, my date tried the Rosemary & Balsamic Poached Chicken Breast & I had the Barbecued Salmon and for our side dish we decided on the Truffle Mac & Cheese.  The Calamari was good, but after a while it became overwhelming with the spices the breading contains, good thing they offer two dipping sauces to change it up a bit, as for the Chicken, it had no flavor what so ever, not sure if Emerils Kitchen had a off day or they are not good in making a chicken dish, I want to think that maybe they forgot something. The Barbecued Salmon was delicious; the BBQ sauce gave it a taste I have never experienced before. I think the Mac & Cheese was good, my date thought it was salty, taste buds right...  I hope to come back and try other items soon and hope some of those items will be great and not just good.  If you want to save some cash try out the 4 Tix places to get a 20% discount on your meal, the wallet will not hurt as bad if you are disappointed in some meals like myself and some other yelpers on here.  Try it out for yourself and I hope you enjoy your meal.",

    "text": "Disappointing client dinner. In short: fantastic appetizers, disappointing main courses, horrible service. I expected much more, especially after my experience with Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans. 2 stars for appetizers and desserts.   We at at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House on 4/14 to entertain clients. We were seated immediately - next to the kitchen door (disappointment #1). After we were seated, we ordered cocktails. It took 40 minutes to get our cocktails. It really stalled the conversation, sitting at the table with just our water, waiting for anyone to stop back by the table.   Once the cocktails arrived, we ordered appetizers. Those took about 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen. We had: Shrimp Cocktail - delicious Bay Scallop Ceviche - amazing. Oysters on the half shell - good. Alligator meatballs - good.  The entrees came out faster than we expected but it still took a while. I'll give the servers credit, they did remove our plates promptly. :/  Entrees: Seafood Pan Roast - disappointing - small amount of seafood, loaded with \"filler\" Texas Redfish - good. Shellfish Pasta - Disappointing- no flavor.   There were a few other entrees but they were not noteworthy.   The desserts were amazing, though! We tried 4 different desserts and they were all amazing.   Overall, I would never go back unless we are only eating appetizers. Our entire meal took 3 hours. THREE HOURS.",

Burt doesn't even know how  long its been open, thats just the feeling Burt gets.  Burt went to UFC 183 and then wanted to celebrate with a nice meal.  Burt SHOULD HAVE gone next door to Craft Steakhouse or Shibuya.  Burt had a short asian male server.  He was terrible!!   Burts corn lobster soup was cold- Burts buddys gumbo had UNCOOKED rice.  Both were returned.  Then he recommended the Ribeye stating it is the greatest steak ever.  Burt says it WAS NOT.  Its ok, but for a $50 piece of meat it should have been much better. It was mediocre at best.  Really good smashed potatoes.  The best thing Burt can say about Emeril's is THE BREAD PUDDING DESSERT IS ONE OF THE BEST DESSERTS BURT HAS EVER HAD.    Emeril needs to stop in and crack the whip. Fire the manager for falling asleep at the wheel.  Fire the server.   Kick the chefs in the ass and promote the dessert guy because thanks to him the place got 2 stars instead of one.  P.S. this place is not cheap.  Now Burt knows why Emeril always says \"Bam!\" its the sound of your wallet getting smashed as you leave unsatisfied and disappointed.",

    "text": "Mr. Emeril Lagasse knows seafood and he knows it well. If you are a fan of calamari, make haste and pay a visit to this place ASAP! I came here with a group of friends and I tried a piece of the calamari appetizer. The seasoning used on the squid and the way it was prepared resulted in pieces of calamari that just melt in your mouth among an orgasmic explosion of yummy goodness. Wow! I've never had such good calamari in my life until now!   My friends all loved what they ordered. While I really liked the apple and butter lettuce salad that I asked for, I thought it wasn't worth the price paid for the portion size and what went in the dish. But that isn't important because my goal of coming here is to try the butter and bread pudding and with that aim, I did. The bread pudding came in a very small portion and at first, I thought that was strange since eyeing the enormous size of banana cream pie slice, I almost freaked out at how big it was. However, I think this bread pudding was meant to be savored little chunks at a time and savored it I did!!! Oh man, it was so warm and buttery and had just the right amount of sweetness. I literally felt a spike of happiness while eating this dessert. Apparently Emeril Lagasse knows bread pudding like a pro as well!   In the distant future, I will come back here for this bread pudding, after I work off the calories amassed tonight of course.",

    "text": "I had such high expectations when I made my reservations, having eaten at two other Emeril's restaurants in the past - one in New Orleans and the other in Florida. Both experiences were awesome -- great food and great service. So good that I vowed that whenever I visit a city where there is an Emeril's I would make it a priority to make a reservation and go.   I wish I could say I had the same experience at this Emeril's as I had in the past. The staff were extremely nice but the timing of the service was super slow. There were times when we felt as if they forgot about us. At the other restaurants, the wait staff took care of our needs before we had to ask in a non-intrusive way. I guess they spoiled us. As for my meal, the gumbo had good flavor but the shrimp were small and overcooked. Ordered the scallops. They were a little small and more rubbery than they should have been. Plus, they lacked the \"bam\" in terms of flavor. Hubby ordered the steak. Nicely done, but not the best he's ever had in terms of flavor.   Overall, we ended up disappointed and let down, especially given the size of the bill. I don't mind paying for good money for good food, but the key word is good. The food and the experience needs to be deserving. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night.",

After putting in our order it did not arrive at a reasonable time. My siblings and I thought it was because the portion size was large. It came the point where we wants to cancel our orders. By the time our food came out I was famished. But I never understood why my food was warm/border line cold. It took forever for it to come out and all our entrees were cold.   Just to top everything off. The chefs special that I order, which was filet mignon, was very salty. I never had a chefs special taste horrible before. Isn't it supposed to be a \"special\" for a reason.  Yeah, the food and experience was not worth the price we paid.",

Starting with drinks, we had one of the fru-fru- cocktails that are handmade from special ingredients, not your run of the mill items, so did it cost a lot - heck yes, but you're on vacation and if you want a fun night out, go ahead and order the Blackbeard Special - it's quite the daiquiri. We ordered from the Prix Frix menu - as we had tickets to see Cher that night and needed to get to the big MGM stadium in time for the show. The menu included your choice of many items...I chose the Little Gem Lettuce Caesar salad - just enough of the salad to leave you wanting for me - perfectly made and with a tasty dressing that was very memorable. Second I had the Sweet Corn Bisque - please order this - you won't be sorry...they do it all fancy table side with fresh ingredients and poured hot soup directly onto those fresh items for a lick the bowl clean soup that makes you wish you could order a crockpot full of this stuff. Then the trouble started...5 minutes, 10 minutes go by and no main course - I ordered the Broiled Halibut, so I know it isn't being blackened or something else that has to be cooked for a long time....finally the Maitre 'D shows up and apologizes for the long wait, saying our entrees took a little longer than expected...another 5 minutes, 10 minutes and finally they show up...waiting that long - you're already disappointed...could be the best fish I ever ate, but waiting that long really was irritating...even with a cute Maitre 'D, have to take off a star - this is an expensive restaurant $65 for the Prix Frix, so come on guys, get with it...you have an army of service people....some dropped the ball on this part. Okay fish was pretty tasty, so I'll give you that...now we're getting to have to worry about our dessert as the wait time was so long for the entree, we may not have time to enjoy...I ordered the Huckleberry cobbler - guess what?  They're out of it on a busy 3 Day Holiday weekend - Wah Wah....Thought about taking ANOTHER star off, but they bounced back and brought us the entire selection of desserts out fit for an army, and they were all great, especially the chocolate cake (even though Emeril is famous for the Banana Cream Pie - we got that too) - the cake - wow - we couldn't eat it all obviously - so they packed it up for us and we took it into the MGM arena...So overview - great spot - bring money - if we go back and we have bad service - I'm taking them down a couple of stars - You have been warned Emeril - BAM!",

    "text": "The short: As close to delicious New Orleans food as you are going to get not being in New Orleans.  The long: I knew I was going to be headed to Vegas and wanted to take a chance and try some of the celeb chef spots in town. I made my reservation about 2 weeks ahead of time which I later found to be a good thing. Apparently this place gets slammed when there is a convention in town and well it is Vegas there is always a convention. I was seated on arrival and my server was over super fast. While he went to get drinks we decided on our meals and when he returned we ordered. Food came out fast and was warm and looked wonderful. I can't say I remember what my wife had but I had the BBQ shrimp and oh my I would almost get a job here just to learn how to make that exact dish. The service was impeccable and when we were finishing we couldn't manage to fit in any dessert but our server suggested the banana cream pie and advised us to come back later and sit at the bar to have some. We actually did come back for that later that evening and wow was he right. I have eaten at a few of these celeb restaurants before and I have to say this one may just be the best one yet.  What works: Great service and great food  What to improve: On my return visit at the bar the bartender was a bit preoccupied flirting instead of working, but otherwise not much I can recall.",

    "text": "I started my meal with the crab cake appetizer. Without a doubt the highlight of the night and some of the best crab cakes I've ever had. It was tender, falling apart with the lightest pressure, and the meat was just delicious. My main course was the BBQ salmon. The BBQ sauce was also top notch. The salmon itself was good, though just a *tad* overcooked, in that it was merely good instead of melt-in-your-mouth delicious. All in all, it was a worthy follow-up to an incredible appetizer.  Now we get to the downsides: I went with Bananas Foster for dessert. The sauce was cold, the banana chunks far too small, and the whole twist on a classic New Orleans dessert just seemed to miss the mark. Disappointing. Our server was also... how shall I put it... obsequious. Rather than waiting for lulls in the conversation, he attempted to talk over several in our party, which resulted in him having to repeat the options multiple times. He went into ridiculous detail about how the wines tasted, but it seemed recited from memory rather than personal experience. Three times we ordered wines only to have him come back and inform us that they were all out. I asked if they had any lambic beers and was informed they did not; upon reviewing the beer list I promptly found Lindeman's Framboise. There were too many rookie moves, like serving some in our party with the wrong hand (if you're serving someone on their right, you need to use your right hand so that your elbow isn't in their space).  My 3 star rating is admittedly grading on a curve. For a restaurant like this I have pretty high expectations, particularly about the service. Would I come back again? Absolutely, if only for the crab cakes. Could it have been better? Yes.",

I feel the roll could of had a bit more chunkier lobster but the taste was good.  I was however disappointing with the Cole slaw, it did lack some taste..and the chips that came with the roll seemed like they were out of a bag.  I was hoping for some house fried chips, but it is what it is.    I'm sure there are other items on the menu that would have been amazing to have.

We were offered both the main menu and the happy hour menu. Although the items on the main menu looked enticing, we stuck with the happy hour menu so we could try more dishes. We also were given a starter on the house -  a delicious salmon crostini. Here's the summary: (pictures attached):  Cornbread basket -- super yum.  Mojito -- tasty and satisfying Tuna poke -- good, but was even better with the sauce from the seafood platter  Barbecue Shrimp -- I didn't like it, but my friends did enjoy it and it is a popular item on the menu Seafood platter -- so good, we ordered it twice! The oysters were fresh and not fishy. Shrimp was great with the horseradish cocktail sauce. The tuna poke was presented on the tera crisp with a wasabi-like sauce (which made it taste better than the tuna poke disk... I know they were the same, but the sauce did make a difference).  All in all, I would return again. More importantly, eating here made me want to try Emeril's other restaurants. This was by far one of my favorite from my trip!",

In addition to THe server,  we met Tony , I believe a manager who was so amazing.  The treatment we received was incredible and the management at this restaurant was over the top.  From the minute you walk up to make a reservation you are treated so well and I say this as being here all week, this was the only place where we could talk about the incredible service and treatment by employees and staff.  We enjoyed delicious Filets cooked to perfection with lovely vegetables.. delicious corn bread they bring out and fabulous drinks and desserts.. If you are in Vegas... go to Emeril's and ask for Tony... he is a charm of a man and makes the dining experience that much better!!",

The chowder was smokey and absolutely delicious, one of the best I've ever had! The BBQ shrimp is beyond words. You simply have to try it! Do yourself a favor and just do it. The flavor is intense and literally addictive! I had forgotten after 17 years how extraordinary it is. I won't forget again. I can't wait to go back, probably in December. This time for dinner.

First server that greeted us, was nice, but not very personable. Didn't ask if we've ever been there before, or asked if we were locals or visiting. Some conversation would've been nice. Took them awhile to even greet us, bring us water / corn bread. I also had to ask a server for my wife's water to be refilled. The service just lacked and it wasn't even busy.   We ordered the Beef Sliders, Shrimp Cocktail, and Poke dip. The food was okay, not something I would rush down to the strip to have again.   Would I recommend? Sure. There's more to the menu then what we had. But as a local I wouldn't return.   My suggestion is train the employees how to provide better service and engage with the customers.",

Anyway, it's slow and they seat us next to the only other table in the section... Akward! I had to ask the big lug sitting there if he could scoot over so I could sit in my seat??. Clearly I annoyed him and then we were all uncomfortable. We were so close that having a conversation felt awkward unless you were going to include the other couple. The seats were the little 2 man tables with one chair and a long booth bench along the wall that everyone shares. Server was nice. Food came quick. We got the jumbo shrimp cocktail and they were blah, no flavor at all. The house made cocktail sauce was different, not bad, not good. We got Bahn Mi Sliders and the flavor was decent, just needed more of the pickling. We got 2 mojitos and disappointed that they used mint leaves that were browning. I mean I know it's happy hour but seriously?! Rotten Mint leaves?? We mentioned it to the waitress and she said sorry.... just sorry.  And I mean it was like 75% of the mint leaves rotten. So of course we we switch to beers. That probably was the best part of this entire experience, $5beers. oh and back to the tables. The weird couple left only for them to see another two ladies right next to us in this big open restaurant. Oh well, at least we got five dollar beers in Vegas.",

Cajun style menu with a slight flair of the network tv star.  I haven't ever tried to replicate any of Emeril's recipes from the show.  I'm more a Giada man myself.  Yet, if this joint is any indicator of how they would taste than I'd download some of his recipes online.  The servers and seaters were great.   I might want to note that I only tried the lunch menu for this review.  For limited offerings the choices were decent.  They start you off with cornbread & butter. Oysters shucked or broiled.  The broiled oysters were great with spice and butterwith the larger eastcoast blue-points .  The shrimp cocktail was ok,  I did like the touch of capers and purple chive or onion type bits in them.  We had to get the gumbo.  It was, well, gumboey.  I've made better.    For main entrees we had the flat iron steak & pomme frites and the shrimp po'boy.  The steak was saucy in a sweet wine reduction sauce.  Which went well with the cajun spiced crispy fries.  They made the steak with just the right color of pink.  that one was good.  The Po'boy was actually great.  Crispy battered shrimp and smooth slaw on toasted french bread slices.  Great lunch material if not too filling.  Good little spot with simple choices and great execution.  3 stars for value.  If I come back here for dinner some time than the stars just might go up.",

The food overall was as good as I remember since I had last eaten at the one in Florida. They have some excellent and unusual items that I just had to try. First there whole head of cauliflower will make a cauliflower lover out of the most ardent hater of this vegetable. I ate some and was extremely impressed by the flavor that it had compared to other preparations of cauliflower I have had. The additional salad I had was the beet salad. I am a big fan of these as they always taste pretty good, but wont fill you up for the main course. Again I was not disappointed here. The item was great and not too filling. We also had a starter of the deviled potatoes. Why not as I have never seen such a thing and love deviled eggs. These were also unique and very tasty. But for the main course I stuck with the redfish. Emeril is famous for this item and after eating it again I am reminded why. The crusting of the fish is amazing. It tasted so good I found myself eating it all even though I was getting pretty full. Unfortunately none of my party had room for dessert after feasting on the great food here. The service was excellent as well. Very attentive and made an overall good experience even better no complaints.",

The fresh oysters, shrimp, scallop cerviche and king crab tasted very sweet.    For our first course, we had the clam chowder  - Wow! one of the bests in Vegas (I always order clam chowder and compare it to others) and I had the ceasar salad which I enjoyed.  The dressing was nice and light.  For our main course, my father had one of Emeril's signature dishes, the Seafood Pan Roast.  It had shrimp, muscles and andouille sausage on top of perfectly spiced rice.  We all tried it and loved it.  I had the blue crab crabcakes and it was heavenly.  Lightly seasoned with a beautiful sauce - and only enough so that you can enjoy that  sweet blue crab taste.  My mother had the tasty Rib-Eye with the smoothest, most delicious red potato mash.  We were tasting and enjoying each other's entrees very much.  Lastly, we topped the night off with \"Taste of New Orleans\" dessert sample which had smaller samplings of  Southern Pecan Pie, Bread and Butter Bread Pudding and Creamy Banana Pie.  We polished off that plate!  All in all,  the great food was surpassed only by the attentive service.  In total, I think 5 people waited on us and it really made for such a wonderful dinner.  Kudos to the chefs in back and thank you to the servers and wait staff - you made me a hero in front of my parents and  you guys rock!!",

(In his case, primarily through the asinine sitcom he starred in instead of the frozen burritos from the movie.) But I've had some great meals at his NOLA home base, and one of my favorite chefs of all time, Anne Kearney, was an early protege of his. Maybe his signature place still stands up?  Maybe; maybe not. Had some time to kill before a flight and decided to try the attractively priced four-course set menu ($48). I went with the New Orleans fare and found it consistently falling a tad short in execution. The crab remoulade had some very nice jumbo lump meat but was served on wilted romaine; the gumbo faintly echoed the flavors of a good one but was badly overcooked, with shrimp the consistency of marshmallows; the barbecue salmon and bread pudding presentations dated.  In its favor, the place has become a relative bargain as each new Vegas celebrity chef outpost strives to outdo (and out-price) the last. Out here, you can spend a lot more and do worse.",

    "text": "I'm reviewing this having been to Emeril's  at the MGM Grand a few years ago, and it looks like based upon reviews from other Yelpers that it has gone down hill. That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.  We had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty.   With what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.  For dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.    The service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared.   The interior decor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.  The price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entree was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entrees. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.  The manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.  I am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right.",

Their corn bread was ok, a bit on the dry side but they did bring out a a side butter as well. I had the gumbo to start and it was delicious. BBQ salmon was my main course, it had onion rings on top and also diced potatoes and sausage as well. I had the salmon in medium but they usually cool to medium rare. It was good but the BBQ was slightly too strong, overtaking some of the other flavors. Overall is was a great dinner but not spectacular.",

I made a couple notes about this in my reservation I requested two glasses of champagne at our table.  When we arrived at the hostess she welcomed us and wished us a happy anniversary.  We were seated at a booth table which was very nice.  The waitstaff came with the two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary.  He was very kind and let us know that he was going to be working with a team to serve us for the night.    They served us complimentary salmon tar tar appetizers as another special note for our anniversary.  Emeril's did a tremendous job making us feel special and truly making the night a romantic one.  I selected Emeril's because it has a New Orleans influence.  I had the gumbo which was phenomenal.  The presentation is great as they bring out a bow with rice and a hot pot with the gumbo in it.  They pour the hot gumbo into your bowl right in front of your eyes.  Really nice.  I don't remember what the name of the seafood plate I had was but it was very good.    To finish of the night we go dessert and they presented it by again wishing us a happy anniversary.  It wasn't only that they kept the theme of the night but they truly cared about our night and seemed genuinely interested in our night.  Emeril's is a personal experience that has service that outdoes any other that I have ever had.   Thanks Emeril's and I look forward to coming back when I am back in Vegas.",

She came back and said the bartender wound serve us at a table....yay My princess ordered Parmesan truffle fries....yum We had a slider trio (pulled pork.) and it came with amazing slaw And of course I had to have the shiishito peppers...I think there was a Hugh percentage of fire ones. I had the French 75 to drink x2 ...soooo good They bartender even loaded my daughters water with cherries so her drink would look like mummy's.  Very happy all around.  We didn't finish everything so they boxed it up and we had a delish snack later on",

We wanted to taste everything, but we narrowed down the starters to the gumbo, jambalaya, and the deviled potatoes (or \"rich people potato salad\" as my husband called it.) The jambalaya was to die for - the large shrimp was cooked perfectly and the rice had the perfect kick! It was delicious! The gumbo was just okay - I think it just paled in comparison to the jambalaya. Maybe it would have been much better on its own. The deviled potatoes were wonderful! Creamy and just a tad spicy. I LOVED them! For my entree, I went with the scallops and clams. It was my first time eating scallops - they were buttery and tasted just like the ocean. The mushroom gnocchi was good also. My husband had the baked chicken with the bacon Brussels sprouts. He thought his chicken was a hit dry, but the sprouts were amazing. This was the best meal I've had in a while! Oh, and the service was great! Food came very fast and my drink never got below the halfway point. Enjoy!",

The food was excellent, generally deserving of the celebrity chef status that Emeril has.  I would definitely recommend the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, it is truly wonderful, and you will not be disappointed.  The crab cakes were exceptional as well.  I also particularly liked the pecan-crusted red fish for the main course, so would recommend that specifically, though I think as long as you stick with the sea food you probably can't go wrong.  For non-sea food, the Pork Chop with Tamarind Sauce was very good.  For desert, of course the Bananas Rum Foster Bread Pudding is classic and very good.  Two warnings, first, if Creme Brulee is on the menu, avoid it, it is the one item I have had at Emeril's which was not very good; second, while coffee refills were frequent, the coffee was tepid, not hot; we did ask that they make sure the coffee was hot, and the servers did make sure we got hotter coffee from then on.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas and had a nice dinner at Emeril's Fish House, which is just outside the MGM Grand Casino (btw, you won't find any signs leading to Emeril's from inside the casino).      We had the 'petite prix fixe' four course dinner , $55.  The first course was a shrimp appetizer dish.  Peeled, succulent, BIG shrimp over some julienned veggies, surrounded by an intense balsamic vinegar reduction drizzled around the plate.  Very nice.  Second course was the lobster cassoulet.  Wow.  Delicious, savory, and elegant dish.  Tender baby lobster tail with a delicious broth, beans, and some diced veggies.    Third course was the main course - a thinly sliced ribeye over creamed spinach.  Here is where there was a small hiccup.  We ordered the ribeye medium rare but instead it came out rare.  Luckily we didn't mind, especially since the meat was of such high quality that it was still tender rare.  You know when the meat quality is top notch when rare steaks are not chewy.   This was the case at Emeril's.  Excellent dish yet again.  The creamed spinach had a subtle kick to it - I tasted a hint of horseradish.  At this point our stomachs were very satisfied and we were glad that we did not go for the full tasting menu which was something like another $20-30 for an additional 2 or 3 dishes.  Not sure how we were going to eat our way through the last course - dessert.  Dessert - choice of banana cream pie and bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  We had one of each and they were both excellent, especially the banana cream pie which is exceptionally noteworthy since I do NOT like banana cream pie at all and try to avoid it at all cost.  However, this was the best banana cream pie I have ever had.  Despite being full, we devoured both desserts fully and waddled out of there, very satisfied and felt like the $55 pp dinner was a very good deal indeed.  A word about the ambiance - not much there.  We felt like the restaurant was nicely decorated, but it was too large of a space and therefore felt cold - not temperature cold, but lacking character.  Also, we noticed the service entrance was very stark and obvious - tables situated right next to openings to the kitchen, uncovered.  It cheapened the look of the place, in our opinion.  Didn't bother us too much but of course we value food over ambiance any day.  Service - excellent wait staff.  Before seating the host properly asked if we had a show to catch after the dinner (we did not).  Courses were served with a nice pace - not too slow, not too fast.  Total dining time was about 1.5 hours, which is about right for me.   Emeril's was not full despite it being the day before new year's eve.  MGM has a LOT of nice restaurants in the casino and Emeril's is surrounded by competition (craft steak house, pearl asian restaurant, etc.).  I hope others give Emeril's a try.  We will definitely go back again.",

The first time we ate here we finally understood why Emeril is always so excited when he's cooking; his food is off the chart in a rich, gluttonously sinful way. I love the steaks here, if youre really lucky they are serving them with buttery lobster mashed potatoes. The BBQ'ed shrimp appetizer is unfortunately small but incredibly delicious, I dare you to not scrape every ounce of sauce off the plate and then wonder if its possible to order just some more sauce. Even though the appetizers and entrees are delicious I do my best to save room for the banana cream pie; its a challenge and I usually fail but luckily we always go at lunch time which gives me plenty of time to recover from a food coma before the nightlife begins. Never having been a banana cream pie, I was hesitant at first, but had absolutely no reason to be. This is a perfect example of really great ingredients coming together in a great way, the graham cracker crumb crust, the shaved chocolate, the caramel drizzle.....I'm getting excited just typing about it, but before I stop I will say, ask for extra caramel, you'll thank me!",

For one order, they give you a pretty big portion. My friend got it to go, and it still held up after a couple of hours. We dug in and i loved the crispy crust with the creamy custard.

    "text": "what a great meal!  first, every person who helped us--every person-- was a pro.  From the hostesses to the bus person to the two waiters--everyone was knowledgeable, eager to discuss, and friendly.  Our waiters--Christian and Dan--answered every question with amazing detail, whether the subject was food or wine.  I'm a foodie--and a former waiter--and I'm so often dismayed at the disinterest servers exhibit when I ask about the food.  Well, at Emeril's Fish House in LV, I never felt as though I was asking for too much detail (even tho i do ask for a crazy amount of detail, I admit).  Everyone was knowledgeable and very, very friendly.   On to the food.  The oyster app was delicious.  Mind you--I have said on many occasions that I plan on dying before eating an oyster.  Dan or Christian convinced me to try it.  Despite my not feeling at all suicidal, this evening, I did try it.  Well, all I can say is, if this is your last meal, order the oysters.  lol.  O.k., suicide jokes (always a crowd fave) aside, the oyster app was very, very good.  Allow me to get a bit foodie-wonky for a moment.  First, it's very, very good. Order it.  The only complaint I have is that the oyster flavor was overpowered by the mushroom, bacon and panko crust--which were all extremely deelish.  Alas, the poor, introverted-in-flavor oyster part of the dish was practically eliminated. So, I'd recommend that this \"proportion\" issue be addressed.  The oyster sort of freshens this very, very excellent dish.   On to the bbq shrimp.  The bbq shrimp app was really wonderful--bbq'd yet creamy, with a rosemary biscuit that was crunchy and absolutely PIPING HOT.  So good.  This is a signature dish and you should order it, as well.   The bbq salmon was perfectly medium rare and the onion rings served with it were super crispy and just salty enough to so wonderfully accent the sweet bbq'd salmon.  Yum.  The mushroom and foix gras side I ordered was simple but wonderful.   I ordered the New Orleans dessert sampler.  The southern pecan pie tart with vanilla ice cream was totally over-the-top amazing.  It's hard to recall the others on the sampler dish because this was so good.  Who makes crusts out of corn meal?!?!?!?  I do--from now on. Corn meal and butter--what could be bad?  But I digress.  Where was I?   Ah, the other desserts.  So, Emeril's banana cream pie.  It's famous.  OK, it was a great dessert.  A little too heavy for my taste (the filling was very, very rich-- a bit too rich, imho)--but it was a great dessert in its own right--but not next to the pecan pie.  The bread pudding was very good, as well--particularly because it was unusually creamy and light and not too sweet--but again, imho, it paled in comparison to the pecan pie tartlet.  Overall, this is a great restaurant.  If you're a foodie, go here.  This is what it's all about.",

Hubby had the: Burger on an Onion Roll with whtie cheddar cheese and steak fries  The waiter was very nice, I even had to ask him what \"vert\" was and he didn't appear to be disappointed in my culinary vocabulary.  He also told us that it was going to be a long wait for the food (only the 2nd people seated, I imagine w/ a packed restaurant it is going to be even longer).    I didn't have the entree but they did come out with yummy bread and whipped butter. mmmm....   The food was great! The vert was cooked perfectly! It was also my word of the day.",

    "text": "Good food not so great service.   For some reason I enjoy a hearty meal on Sundays, so I decided that I would give Emerils a try. Came straight to the MGM from the MCcarran Rental Car Center because I wanted to take advantage of the lunch menu. My server didn't seem to enthused to see a solo diner in her section. It was very obvious because she focused all her attention on the tables directly in front of me and those on the side. She treated me as if my money was no good...that's too bad blondie because I am usually a VERY good tipper but you pissed me off. I really wish I had that overly accommodating friendly gentleman waiter because that would have given me a better overall dining experience. I would have given Emeril's 4 stars for the food. However, I had to deduct 1 star because the service needs a serious overhaul. Overall, the food was really good. Here's what I ordered:   Gumbo $7.00 -  VERY disappointing! It had precooked skimpy shrimp and pea sized andouille sausage that you need a microscope to see. Honestly, it tasted straight out of a soup can. Campbells makes a better gumbo than this. Sorry Emeril, I suggest you go back to the drawing board on the gumbo.   Pan Roast $24.00 -  Two small medallions of fish, shrimp and I believe pea sized andouille sausage in Cajun spices over rice). DELICIOUS! I was a bit skeptical after that boxed gumbo experience, but the pan roast was phenomenal. I added Emerils Kicked Up Green Pepper Sauce for an extra kick. loved the sauce so much that I purchased some to take back home.   Emerils Kicked Up Green Sauce $2.80. The bomb!!!   Butter Bread Pudding in Warm Whiskey Sauce - Comped because their was a glitch with my reservation. They even included a scoop of delicious cinamon ice cream. OUT OF THIS WORLD!   Ice Tea $3.00   Grand Total - $39.54 before tip   If you love Emeril and you just have to check Emeril's New Orleans Fish Hose off your list, consider going for lunch.",

    "text": "I agree with Virginia Y's review about the bam factor.  Almost everything I had was waaay too salty for my liking!  Even the rosemary bread - though pretty tasty... again, the salt factor spoiled it for me...   i suppose I shouldn't be too surprised by how the dishes were overly 'seasoned'.  I mean, have you seen the amount of salt Emeril 'bams' his bloody way through his shows?  Apparently, the chef that day was also doing his take on his boss's style.  I like Emeril - as a tv entertainer behind his fancy little kitchen in the studio... studio in the kitchen?  Anywayz, he makes people laugh and unlike Bobby Flay, i don't find him sickening and annoying.  But I honestly don't see him as a chef.  I mean, how many gazillion dishes can you put the same bloody seasoning on?!      To start, I had the shrimp remoulade salad - nothing special.  I wish they'd given me some extra remoulade sauce on the side... it was barely enough to taste - however, the little I tasted, it made me want more - the one bloody thing they don't give me more of is the sauce I want - of course!  It was good but it could have been far better.  My husband had the blue crab and bell pepper fondue - he loved it and said it was very well executed, whatever that means.  Think he's also been watching too much Top Chef :)  We got the seafood gumbo to share - yes we were being complete pigs!  Shit, we were being comped $100 by the casino for our meal so don't think we were going to be coy and not take full advantage of it :)  ...surprisingly, the gumbo was very tasty!  I've had my share of bad gumbo (even in New Orleans!) so I must say, I was nicely impressed.    For entrees, we had the seafood pan roast with jambalaya and the fish special of the day; striped bass with corn macque choux.  Both the jambalaya and the corn macque choux were absolutely delicious.  As for the the fish in both dishes, they were omg way too salty!  ...so was the butter sauce on the pan roast.  Insane!  Nice thing was, when I brought it up to our second waiter, he was very good about it and actually offered to get the kitchen to redo my dish.  No, I didn't let them - after all, by that time, I had enough food in me to last me another week!  Our first waiter (unlike our second one) was the most depressing looking service person on the job.  When he was serving us and telling us the specials, he never once smiled nor looked like he wanted to be there... but when he was either standing with his other colleagues chatting away or when he was standing by himself talking (to himself) - I kid you not - he looked like he'd taken some serious happy pills!  It was quite funny - especially when it looked like he was at a stand-up comedy routine all by himself.  Yes he was laughing!  Ok, I was obviously a little too distracted by this guy...  If it wasn't for the saltiness of the food, I would have given it at least a 1/2 more star... the weird waiter didn't bother me too much.  It was just funny to me.  Will I go back to Emeril's?  Sure... especially if the casino would like to pay our way again.  Our tab that day (before tipping) came up to a whole dollar over the $100 comped :D",

My favorites were the Striped Bass and the Atlantic Salmon.  The Bass had a devine butter sauce with just enough Caviar to make the taste something special as did the dash of Serrano Ham in the paste that came with the Atlantic Salmon.  I'd have preferred the Salmon to be a little less cooked, but I'd hardly call what I got disappointing.  A close second was the Grilled New York Strip Steak which had a great Worcestershire sauce that complemented the meat nicely.  The wines complementing each course were chosen well from the restaurant's extensive wine collection.  I highly recommend this wonderful restaurant.",

You could try to make it yourself as Emeril posts the recipe here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emerils.com%2Frecipe%2F5022%2FBanana-Cream-Pie-with-Caramel-Drizzles-and-Chocolate-Sauce&s=7344e9328ca4c97f9bb13888fd30ed607604c4212af2f6f7c855d959dc99c3b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">emerils.com/recipe/5022/...</a>  But...if you look at the recipe...it's pretty complicated.  I had an easier time in organic chemistry, back in undergrad.  If you choose to dine in here, I go for the ribeye.

I had read the reviews and while my normal go to was chicken, and I don't really do fish, this seemed like a good pic. We started off with appetizers (ceviche and crab claws were good), and a few drinks. The service was good, though we were one of the few tables in at the time.   The entrees came out and I was pretty impressed by my place. I nice rib eye on a cedar plank, and a side dish of potatoes. However, I was sad to hear most of the rest of the table rave about how spicy and flavorful their dishes were, while mine was pretty \"meh\". Maybe that's what I get for ordering steak at a fish house, but I can't say I would recommend this place to others.",

I had the signature sweet BBQ salmon.   Different and delicious.  My husband had the seafood pan roast that was quite good.  But the very best was the Huckleberry cobbler.  Real berries, fabulous crust.   All in all a very good dining experience.  There is ongoing construction that detracted from the ambience, but won't last forever.",

    "text": "I had lunch today at the bar at Emeril's, wile watching the New Orleans Saints football game on the flat screen.  Somehow, it seemed appropriate.  They have done a pretty fair job of creating a high end New Orleans vibe in the middle of Vegas. It is decorated in soft blues, wave like wood accents and wavy metal sculptures with sand colored Walls and aqua leathers.   Service at the bar was quick and efficient.  I started with the Chicken, Shrimp & Andouille Gumbo with Long Grain Rice & Green Onion.  It was excellent.  Just the right degree of spice and cooked perfectly.  I also tried the Tequila and Lime marinated fish tacos.   there were nice pieces of fish on warm flour tortillas with a pico consisting of tomatoes, black beans some large pieces of avocado.  They were topped with a jalapeno sour cream. They were pretty good but lacking that expect Bam! (sorry, I couldn't resist)  However, a little of Emeril's green pepper sauce spiced the up nicely.  The gumbo, tacos and a glass of Merlot were just under $40 before the tip.  Not too bad for Vegas.  I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I think Emeril only invests his expertise in main dishes.   Normally, I like to rate the courses as a whole experience. But in this joint's case, they all seem to be on different levels. The appetizer was the tuna tacos that ran me $17. They were pretty good, and I know it doesn't seem like much but $15 would be a much better price. Fairly uncomplicated flavors; you're really just paying for the quality of the fish.  The main courses ordered were the sea bass with garlic polenta and the baked clams... which were both phenomenal. These dished shoot the rating up to the 3 stars.  Dessert was some kind of turtle cheesecake that was small, tasteless and dull. I guess they figure they have you in for the main dishes, why spend the extra overhead on dessert items? To be fair, I haven't tried the rest of the desserts but really, how do you mess up the cheesecake?",

Vegetables on every plate were made with the view that all flavor come from charring and none from spice.  Blackened salmon was actually bland.

The ladies in our group decided to order off the lunch menu where as both of the men decided to stick with just dessert.  I had the BLT with fries. Wow! Incredibly delicious. I'm pretty sure there was half a pound of apple smoked bacon on that sandwich! And I loved the taste of the aioli. The fries were a little spicy for my taste but I still ate about half of them.   My friends ordered the jambalaya and the gumbo. Both found the portions to be plenty for lunch, and also delicious.  When the slices of Banana cream pies were delivered to the table I understood why the men only ordered dessert. All I can say is wow! These were some giant pieces of pie. Definitely enough to fill you up / substitute for a meal.   Everyone was very happy with their food, although the service was extremely slow, Especially considering they were not busy. We actually had to flag down a different waiter to ask for ketchup and drink refills. We also waited a very long time once we were done eating for the check.   Based on the taste of the food, I would come here again. I would just need to plan to not be in a hurry.",

After we ordered the Marinated Beet Salad and Scottish Salman to share. The quinoa and veggie salad that accompanied the salmon had absolutely no taste and was under seasoned. We could not finish it. The beet salad was mediocre at best.  Was hoping for way better from an Emeril's restaurant.",

First things first, the service was prompt and friendly. They gave us warm cornbread with softened butter on the house to start which I wasn't even expecting but oh my!!! It was like my second favorite part of the meal. It was so crazy good. Made me super :) :) :) Then our mocktail came and the mojito was so refreshing. They did not skimp out on the mint which I think is so important. The beef satay and the lobster roll was alright but wasn't delicious or anything. But the gumbo was amazing and definitely I'd recommend it. I loved the depth of flavours and it was hearty and filling. It was supposed to be a light snack but we ended up full afterwards so it was more like an early dinner. Definitely one to try out if you're up for Louisiana flavours.",

My husband and I have been going to Emeril's for years, starting on our 10th anniversary and culminating in an amazing dinner at the Chef's Table to celebrate my daughter's 31st birthday. We enjoy fine dining and this restaurant is consistently wonderful-- both in terms of the food and and the service! We still recall the salmon dish and the amazing flourless chocolate cake with raspberry culee we had almost 25 years ago! More recently we have had the tasting menu and it is always \"stand out\" amazing! Last time we were there for our 34th anniversary and  the tasting menu was not \"on the menu\".. but because of their amazing service, they were willing to do it for us anyways (Thanks Anthony!). Each course is better than the previous one (5 courses total for $100/person) and the desert was beyond belief, allowing us to try Emeril's most famous desserts! So, that said, we reserved the \"Chef's Table\" for my daughter's birthday the other night. As huge food network fans, we planned this as our meal AND entertainment. We were not disappointed! The service was AMAZING as always, but this time we were served by the chefs rather than servers... My personal favorite was Patrick, who described every dish they brought out. They made a very special \"Mac and cheese\" for my 5 year old granddaughter, and offered to make her something else when they thought she hadn't eaten enough, LOL! Again, the deserts were to die for... I just can't say enough good stuff about this restaurant! Just go.. It's not good, it's amazing! Best service (stand out server is Anthony if you're getting standard service and not the Chef's Table). EVERYTHING is cooked perfectly, with amazing sauces, etc. If you are not picky, put yourself in the chefs' very capable hands... You will NOT be disappointed!",

The fish was perfectly cooked and tasted oh so good. The vegetables were done so well that my son ate every last bite!   The lamb chops were so tasty and included a potato cake that was perfectly done over goat cheese. It was also stupendous.  The fried frog legs were seasoned perfectly, and it was a great first experience with frog legs for my son.  The berry salad was good, but was a little too plain.

Thank you Emeril's and staff for the great hospitality and lasting memories!",

I stuck with water this time, but I tried one of the girls drinks and it was delish! I wish I could remember what it was. It was kind of tropical-ish?  I started with the Shrimp cocktail. It's served differently from most, on a plate. It was SO good though! There was cocktail sauce drizzled and onions and capers! Yum!   For dinner I had the BBQ salmon, which is not something I would normally give a second look to, but it caught my eye this time and I'm so glad it did!! It was probably the best salmon I've ever had!   It is slightly pricey, but it is so worth it if you are looking for a great meal in the MGM. I will definitely come back here when I am in Vegas again!",

They start you off with fresh baked corn bread. For my courses I ordered the  BBQ Shrimp, Squid Ink fettuccine w king Crab meat and Pan seared trout and were all thoroughly enjoyed. The fourth course and probably the best was the desert. ENOFH is known for their banana cream pie! It's super delicious and everyone orders it. Must try!!!",

    "text": "If I could ever be on the show \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" I would talk about this meal.  First of all, let me just say that I love seafood.  I've watched Emerill's show and I've always loved him. So, that's the reason I wanted to go to this restaurant.  The decor wasn't impressive, it was pretty manly looking (fish statue, fish scale design). The hostess was very nice (I made a reservation on open table). The waiter was very nice and knew the menu very well. I had never heard of red fish, he told me all about it. I don't eat red meat so I asked if there was any meat in the grits, he went and made sure and I ended up not getting the sauce because it had veal stock. He brought me a side sauce, but I liked my meal better without it.   The red fish was breaded. It was served on top of grits and sauteed mushrooms (I think). Everything was delicious. The fish was amazing, the mushrooms were perfect, and the grits were yummy! My mom tried it and she thought it was delicious too. I practically licked the plate! I wish I could eat it all again right now!  My mom ordered the stuffed Shrimp and that was also delicious. It was served with a little black pea salad that was amazingly tasty.  You also get cornbread as you wait, oh my gosh it is so good! It was the best bread basket I ever had in Vegas. I had to refrain from eating it all because I wanted to save room for my meal.  The meal came pretty quickly too. The server was very attentive. Overall best restaurant I've been to Vegas, and maybe ever!  I liked this place way better than Mesa Grill (sorry Bobby).",

It was good but the bbq sauce was a bit much. My companion ate the redfish and it was very good. Everyone working at this place is top notch though. Overall the food is very good but I was expecting a little more. Honestly, Chicago has better Cajun seafood restaurants. I probably won't visit next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "After weaving through the labyrinth that is the MGM Grand we finally stumbled on Emeril's just in time for our reservation.  The view from outside in unimpressive and looks more like an indoor strip mall or, dare I say, a Food Court.  The hostess was friendly and guided us to our table without issue.  We were seated near the rear of place toward the kitchen.  They have a really cool light fixture above the expo window and a see through glass to the kitchen.  The waiter comes directly to the table and laughs at me for looking toward the kitchen and says \"no he is not here\" assuming that I was looking for Emeril. But then he adds \"in fact he is never here\".  This is not my first trip to a restaurant run by a famous chef, and I was not looking for Emeril, but I am sure that this would be lost on this arrogant jerk, so I said \"oh, I was just looking at the kitchen\" to which his response was \"you can do whatever you want\".  My wife adds \"cool, can we go back and cook\" and he replied \"I am sure you wouldn't be any worse than those guys\".  I thought this was an odd statement but after the meal I realized it was an honest account of how bad the food really is here.  My wife got the baby spinach and blackberry salad.  The dish came out and was she just ate the berries and nectarines.  The dressing had absolutely no flavor so the spinach was ruined,  The dish just didn't seem to come together; however, it was miles better than the heirloom tomato and avocado salad that was placed in front of me.  This flop of a dish was nothing more than a poor way for the kitchen to reuse yesterday's stale cornbread, I picked through the tomatoes and avocado and left 85% of the dish in tact.  The waiter cleared the plate away without asking any questions.  For the next course, i decided to take a chance and try the trio of chilled summer soups.  I am usually not a fan of cold soup, but with Emeril's reputation of nailing flavors, I thought this might be an interesting way for the kitchen to show off some cajun flavor.  I was wrong.  The tangy tomato soup was gross.  The avocado lime was palatable but boring.  The roasted pepper soup (that had Emeril's initial on it) tasted like sink water after soaking red bell peppers.    My main course arrived and the meat was cold, all four little strips of meat on the plate.  Of course this was no surprise because of the odd service style of this place.  The food runners take food only as far as the servers area then your food just sits and waits for you.  So we sat ten feet from our food and basically watched it get cold.  The meat sat atop a small mountain of oddly fried potatoes that were rubbery as though they had been fried yesterday and reheated.  The bread pudding was more like a bowl of day old Quaker oats that had congealed.  I took some of the chocolate shavings from the banana cream pie topping and rescued this disaster of dessert.  For a chef that is known for kicking flavors \"up a notch\"  this place was several notches below acceptable.",

We were so looking forward to barbecue shrimp with grits for dinner so we walked all the way over from The Venetian cutting short our gambling and skipped eating at one of their restaurants for convenience.  The andouille gumbo and clam chowder were fantastic.  The barbecue shrimp was disappointing compared to the same dish at his NOLA restaurant in New Orleans.  There were no grits and the shrimp was spice-rubbed resulting in a very spicy taste which we didn't expect.  Now I adore spicy foods, but was looking forward to the same dish served at NOLA.  But the lack of grits really upset me as a southern girl myself.  Bring back the original dish with grits!  Service was excellent, but we left after finishing our entrees so we could indulge at a Chinatown bakery to soothe our disappointment.",

The decor set a very classy, elevated mood that set the tone for a wonderful dinner.  Our wait staff was quite attentive and gave us a thorough explanation of portion sizes, specials and recommended dishes. The wine selection was incredibly vast, so our waiter selected two bottles based on the type and price range I typically aim for - they were perfect.  I had a tuna tartar and spinach salad (both very fresh, though the tuna portion was a little on the small side), and for the table, we ordered mac n cheese and mushrooms bourdelaine. Both sides were decadent but I was disappointed that they weren't larger - they were described to us as \"family style\" and there was only enough for each of us 4 to take a very small helping.  Overall, though, a pleasant experience. I would probably go back.",

That being said, we loved every cotton-pick'n moment of our visit to Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Rocko, our server was professional, prompt, and anything but pompous.  He was confident, courteous, and responsive to our desires and needs.     After a quick glance over the menu, but not yet to the back, I knew that I wanted a sampler (you know like you get at Red Lobster or Captain D's) and then I turned the page.  There it was!!   A six course tour (certainly not a sampler, however) of Emeril's kitchen.   My wife saw it too, but it had some shell fish and being she can't eat shell fish...  Rocko came to the rescue.  He and the chef substituted a blacken-pepper crusted tuna for the scallops and oh, that was delicious....    The wine selections matched each course in perfect harmony, too.  Anyway to make a long story short, yelp, it was a great once in a long time event to enjoy Emeril's experience.",

    "text": "Another day, another business dinner. This time Emeril's was the pick. Despite reading a bunch of Yelp reviews I was hoping our experience would somehow be different than the majority. It wasn't.   Let's start on a good note: service was a bit overbearing, but otherwise great. (4/5 stars)  Entrees: WOW I can't believe how freaking awful these were. At the price point they were (which btw, the prices have gone up compared to what they are on the website!!) they really should have been much better.  Sea bass with lobster ($42): How can you go wrong? Well somehow Emeril went very wrong on this pricey dish. First impression, the plate is VERY white with just a little bit of puke green. Imagine a white mushy flavorless \"potato cake\" swimming in a small sea of nasty pukeish green \"chile sauce\" topped with a tiny 4 oz piece of white sea bass and a tiny 2 oz piece of rubbery lobster. White mushy fish on white mushy potatoes? What idiot thought that pairing would work?? The components didn't work, the dish was executed poorly. Honestly no redeeming qualities to this hella expensive $42 dish.  Ahi Tuna special (off menu so not sure of the price): Yes the tuna was damn good, but it was swimming in a sea of TOMATO SAUCE with sausage ravioli? Seriously are the chefs here on crack? Red tuna + acidic red tomatoes = no bueno.   Sorry philosophically I think a well thought out entree should represent BALANCE. Red tuna + red sauce? White fish + white potatoes ? Aesthetically, and on a texture basis these dishes were epic fails. They tasted \"ok\", but at $40++ a plate it should taste way more than ok.   Alright so now you're wondering why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2?? The desserts were f-ing AMAZING. Please follow the advice of me and several other yelpers and only come here for dessert. The beignets, bread pudding and banana cream pie were all spectacular. Emeril really does have the best banana cream pie in the entire world and it's worth a trip to the bar here to have a slice for yourself!",

    "text": "Good experience here! Went on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't busy at all. Thought that may be a sign of what was to come but it most certainly was not. The restaurant has a $25 corkage fee which we though was reasonable and they were more than accommodating with our champagne. The interior was cool, the bar area had some neat decor and overall had a pretty inviting atmosphere.   Highlight of the night: Michael, our server. Great guy, great recommendations and genuinely a good dude! Chat him up if given the opportunity, he's got some tales to tell!  Overall, food was good. The sashimi grade scallops were done to perfection, literally melted in your mouth. We were going to do the crab cakes, but Michael recommended the scallops... so glad he did! They were delicious. Then we had the BBQed salmon and some white-sauce/shrimp/pasta dish that I can't remember the name of at the moment... the salmon was done perfectly, the prawns and pasta were smothered in garlic (overwhelming or nauseatingly delicious, depends how much you like garlic!), the andouille sausage and potato hash was great... only problem was the onion rings that came with the salmon. They were SO over-seasoned that it was difficult to enjoy them with the other components of the dish. Granted, southerners tend to season a little more liberally than others... stereotype? I don't know, after watching some TV shows on southern food I think it's probably True! Regardless, we were happy with out meals.  Second highlight of the night: the banana cream pie!!!!! If you're like me, it doesn't sound all that appetizing. Until you see it!! Man, what a dessert... so tasty, we debated seconds for 10 minutes!",

    "text": "A True 5 star meal at last! With the exception of my brother's cooking, it feels like months since the last time I had a meal this delicious.   Not wanting to set myself up for disappointment, my expectations were fairly low. No one really seemed excited about this place, and Emeril's appeal has sort of worn off. But our entire experience here was outstanding. We came at 10:00pm, and frankly, I'm glad we were here late, although it was still quite busy when we first arrived.   I liked the inside of the restaurant. Due to the high ceiling and the way the tables were set up, it created an illusion of intimacy and spaciousness, even though there were quite a few people there. (Chihuly is everywhere, I can't escape him!)  Our server was such a kick. We didn't get any Emeril schtick from her, just genuine New Orleans service (she was from there). She was so attentive and kind, she even took us by the arm to escort us to the restrooms.   She did a fantastic job of explaining the menu and pointing out the notable dishes. Vince and I went with the tasting menu, while the others weren't quite so hungry.  I have to say that this was right up there with the best tasting menus I've ever had, but what really blew me out of the water was the perfection of the wine pairings. Every single last one of them was brilliant.  For your drooling pleasure, our meal consisted of: - Achiote marinated & grilled jumbo gulf shrimp w/mixed baby green & orange segments tossed in a cumin vinaigrette, toasted pine nuts and queso tetilla; paired with a Spanish white. - Seared Maine sea scallop with caramelized onion & sweet potato bread pudding w/ bacon braised southern greens and apple brandy reduction; paired with a New Zealand chard. - Sweet BBQ Atlantic salmon on a homemade andouille sausage and Brabant potato hash w/ spicy onion crust and Emeril's homemade Worcestershire sauce; paired with an Oregon pinot. - Pecan crusted mahi mahi with grilled vegetables, stone ground grits and creole meuniere butter sauce; paired with a California sangiovese. - Grilled filet of beef on lobster & sweet corn risotto with sauteed haricot vert and charred tomato reduction; paired with a Washington merlot.  - Tiramusu, paired with a vintage port, which we subbed out for another dessert wine that I don't remember.  All of this deliciousness was only $70, plus $50 for the wine pairing. I think that's pretty reasonable for what we got, plus it's about the same as what we paid for similar tasting menus in Sonoma County. The tasting menus at the other restaurants at the MGM were all much, much more than that (but also of a much higher caliber, I suppose).   Like Vince mentioned in his review, it's pretty incredible that they were able to come up with wine pairings for a lot of these dishes, since there is such a crazy mix of flavors (the salmon in particular), but not only did they pull it off, they did it very well.   I slowed down toward the end and took most of my steak to go. I was thrilled when I ate it the next day for lunch and it was so tender and bloody, just the kind of perfect steak I've been craving, and that lobster risotto with it was delicious.   I would definitely come here again, plus I want to check out some of these other tasty looking restaurants at the MGM.   Summing up: Awesome.  --11/15/06 update-- Today in the mail I got a handwritten note from our server thanking us for our visit and inviting us back again. A simple gesture, but much appreciated!",

    "text": "Something fishy at Emeril's...  I came here for dinner with a party of four a few months ago.  Our meals were all pricey and were not really that great.  We got the calamari and the scallops for the appetizer.  Both of which were OK, but not that great.  For the entree, we had the salmon, steak, chicken, and pork chops.  I had the salmon and did not really care for the overpowering and almost offensive barbeque sauce it was covered in.  The other entrees were described as just \"OK\" and \"I've had better\".   The real trouble began when we got our bill.  The other couple my wife and I were dining with had cash and I had a credit card.  To make things easier, I asked the waitress to apply the cash to our bill and put the rest on my credit card.  Not that difficult of a request.  If my local diner can accomplish this task, why not a fancy Vegas restaurant.  I don't have the exact amounts in front of me, but let's say the bill came out to $300 and my dining partners contributed a $100 dollar bill.  The amount that should have been left over for the credit card is $200.  Well, the bill comes back to the table (dropped off by someone else this time) and it is a credit card receipt for $220.  Since when does $300 minus $100 equal $220?  We called the guy over who dropped off the bill and explained everything to him and he claims to have no idea what is going on and leaves to go get our waitress.  After a bit of a wait, she comes over and we explain everything to her.  She claims the bill is correct.  After explaining basic mathematics to her and her still saying the bill is correct we then ask to please see our original bill that was dropped off at our table a few minutes ago so that we can show more clearly that $300 minus $100 does not equal $220.  She says she can't do that because their computer system won't allow it.  WTF?!  We then say OK if the computer won't allow it, don't reprint it, just bring it to us since it was here just a minute ago.  She then says they don't keep the receipts.  Do they burn them upon payment?  What the hell is she talking about they don't keep the receipts from 10 minutes ago?  We then get pissed off and demand to know what happened to the receipt.  \"It must still be in the restaurant somewhere\", we tell her.  The waitress, now very annoyed and red-faced, says she will be back.  We waited for about 10 minutes as she and the guy who had dropped off the check were huddled around a computer screen.  The restaurant was closing at this point and we were the last customers left.  The waitress and waiter disappear into the back for another few minutes and then she comes out and rudely slaps down a waded up piece of paper which was our itemized receipt that was supposedly no longer available for us to see.  We then went through the whole math equation again with her and wanted to know where the extra $20 charge came from.  She then told a story about how their computer system automatically splits bills that way if you apply cash to a credit card payment.  We then say, \"so you overcharge every customer who pays this way by $20 because of a computer glitch?\".  Her story rambled on and on and never really made any sense.  She finally, rudely, brought us an adjusted bill after spending another 10 minutes at the computer.  Just to make sure, we pulled out the calculator and added it all up again and it was still overcharging us by about two dollars.  We did not really care about this small sum of money, but my wife pointed it out and wanted to know why we just can't get the proper amount to show on the bill.  The waitress then snaps at us and says \"If you really want the two dollars I'll give it to you, is that what you want!\"  We then just say \"No, we don't care about a couple dollars. We just want to know why it is so difficult to just charge us for the proper amount.  Why do you keep overcharging us.  It's just the point, whether it's $2 or $20\".  We then sign our receipt and she snatches it up.  When we finally left the restaurant, some of the workers were standing around giving us dirty looks like we had inconvenienced them or something.  Not sure if we were trying to be ripped off or if the whole rambling computer splitting bills that way story is True or not.  Either way, we would have given them an extra $20 had we not caught it.  I wonder if this is a common occurrence at the ol' Fish House and if this has happened to others without them knowing???   Based on the overpriced food that is not very good, the very rude and almost hostile service we received, and the very questionable billing situation we encountered, I will have to put this up there as one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Fish House....You Stink!",

    "text": "I went to for Emeril's the first time this past weekend. The boyfriend got the Grilled Prime Beef Ribeye while I got the Sweet Barbecued Scottish Salmon. To be completely honest, the meal was somewhat of a downer. Without a doubt, the Mac-n-Cheese was the highlight of the meal. The cheese was so gooey and smokey. It was perfection! Conversely, the ribeye was pretty tough and bland, instead of being juicy and tender. The Scottish salmon was good, I enjoyed it, but I wasn't wowed by it. When you're spending $100+ for a meal for two, you expect to be WOWed by every single bit. And sadly, I wasn't.",

Man, Las Vegas has gone Manhattan. The restaurant was very good overall. Sharply decorated and lit. The wait staff was very attentive and ready to get you anything. I had the seared ahi on top of endives and these white beans I forgot the name of. Very yummy. Oh yea, it was $34. My girlfriend had grilled white fish (I can't remember the name of it) with gnocchi. Very good as well. $36. They have smaller portions and I assume they assume you'll get a couple of appetizers. We only got a small salad to share. $10. Mojito $10. Glass of pinot grigio $7. Bill: $120 with tip.  I would go back but I'll wait for when I hit big on roulette. I liked the hipster vibe there and appreciated the atmosphere which drew in a diverse crowd.  The wine list is actually a thick 60-page novel with quite a variety.  Go here if you're looking for inventive dishes with excellent service. I did, however, find some of the menu options uninteresting. Half roasted chicken, casear salad. There were others that really didn't catch my eye. I was surprised since Emeril seems quite innovative. Speaking of Emeril, it seems that the restaurant just slapped his name on the place and ran with it. I really don't see what his influence is. There isn't much of a mention of him other than his trademark \"bam\" on the menu a couple of times.",

More than Del Monico(i know they are both owned by Emeril)!! When he orders a rare steak, unlike some places, they bring it out rare. He dislikes greens but when he gets steak from this place, everything on the plate disappears!! The wine selections are also great. We are no wine experts, so we ask the waiter or waitress what they might like to recommend. They bring out something that we might like, to figure out if we like it or not, and then brings out something that we will both love!! I can't wait to go to veags again!! I love Emeril's!!

    "text": "This restaurant is one of MGM Grand's many fine dining establishments. Reservations are required, but it's not too difficult to get one. Now, on to the experience.  As we are seated, we are introduced to our team of servers. We had 3 people helping a table of 3. I like the numbers already. I ordered a chocolate martini to start off the night. The martini was very strong. It was just an okay martini, not very special. I think the chocolate martini over at New York, New York's Gallagher's is better.  Besides the normal menu, they offer a tasting menu of 7 courses that has been reduced to servings of 3-4 oz each course. The cost was $75 per person. If you wanted wine pairings to go with it, it was an extra $25 per person. Seemed lovely, but probably too much food for one person. We decided to just go for appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  We started the evening with an order of the Avocado and Blue Crab crabcakes with some sort of slaw. The slaw and the crabcakes made an excellent combination, as well as the avocado and the crab. There was tons of crab in the cakes and the avocado helped to bind the meat together very effectively. I liked it, but didn't love it. On the other hand, I loved the Seared Scallops over a frisee salad with bits of walnut. The bus boy brought a round of breads for each person. Each of us got a corn bread muffin and a piece of onion loaf. Each was delicious. The corn bread was perfectly sweet and moist while the onion loaf was flavorful and not overly strong. Perfect bread.  My mother ordered the Salmon with some sort of mango sauce. It was grilled perfectly - not overcooked and not undercooked. But salmon is pretty hard to mess up. My father had the fish of the day, which was a Hawaiian Spearfish (Hebi). It was also perfectly cooked. But I have to say, the fish was just fish. Not that crazy or anything. I, on the other hand, went for the Louisiana Cedar Plank Campfire Steak, which was Creole spiced (think: Emeril's Essence), served with Trinity (traditionally celery, carrots, onions), Warm Remoulade (gotta ask Emeril what the heck that is), and Country Smashed Potatoes. The steak was pretty good. I liked the Trinity over it. But I LOVED the mashed potatoes. Potentially the very best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Yeah. That good. Needless to say, I at only half of the steak and a few spoonfuls of the potatoes because I was pretty full already. I happily took a doggy bag home because I was saving room for dessert.  I had some espresso to help wash down my food. My mother had plain coffee. The coffee was not spectacular. I think the buffet had better drip coffee. The espresso was just fine, but again not great. What WAS great was the dessert: Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie with Banana Crust, Chocolate Shavings and Caramel Sauce. Heavenly. It was not too sweet. It was not too creamy. It was perfect. The crust was also delicious.  Overall, I would say a 4 out of 5. However, the service was really excellent. They were on top of everything. As soon as you put your silverware on the plates, they came right away and knew you were done. They pull out the chairs for you and let you take your time without you feeling forgotten. So, I'd say the service alone pushes it to a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend the place.  We gave a hefty tip, and all in all, the total was $200 for 3 people (no wine, just 1 martini and 2 fountain drinks).  UPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back a few times recently and the food was not that great. Not a lot of choices in fish - strange for a fish restaurant! Anyway, the banana cream pie was just as perfect as I remembered. I think the slice was smaller though. Must be the economy!",

The wait staff was top notch from start to finish, not only were they all super attentive but also very informative about everything on the menu. I planned our first anniversary dinner here as a married coulpe because my husband is orginally from Louisana and it did not dissapoint. We each ordered a bowl of soup before our meal, the clam chowder for my other half and gumbo for the creole in me. And we both were pleased on both our choices. I spiced mine up with a little Tabasco sauce and it was delish. I knew I wanted seafood for my main course here but  all the choices were endless and had a hard time deciding. I pointed out the surf n turf to my husband and we both planned on ordering the same dish. Our waiter pointed out that part of our check would be donated to one of Emeril's Foundations because this dish was created for this menu. The steak was as big as the plate and perfectly cooked. It was the most tender and flavorful steak we have ever had and you could forget the A1 sauce tonight because here it is not needed.  I have never had a dry aged steak before in my life and no im hooked. It was served with a pile of blue crab maded potatoes and grilled asaragus, which were all done perfectly. Then we decided to order the banana cream pie as it is the most requested for dessert and no disapointments here. Real whipped cream, fresh banana slices (not brown, a stand up pudding and a crust that was super flakey. I enjoyed a glass of Moscato wine from Nivole to end the night. All in all this was the best dinner date that we have ever been on and would love to come back here next time were in Las Vegas. Hats off to the staff and chef's here again :)",

We love cooking shows, so have always wanted to eat at a \"tv chef\" restaurant and we were on a mini-honeymoon--time to splurge! Service was amazing!  Best....service...ever!   For appetizer, we got the bacon-wrapped scallops.  The scallops were not great.  His was ice-cold in the middle and mine had grit in it.  However, they were on this magical substance that our waiter explained was celery-root puree.  It had asparagus and mushroom pieces in it and I wanted to ask them to forget my dinner and bring me a bowl of that.  It was one of the best things I have ever had in my life.   Hubby got seared ahi over raviolis and I had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  The ahi was wonderful but didn't quite go with the ravioli.  They were much better eaten separately.  My pasta was fantastic with giant shrimp and big chunks of lobster.  Portions were very good sized surprisingly!  After all that we could barely breathe, but managed to find room for creme brulee made with Baily's.  It was worth squeezing in.   Overall, we had a wonderful dinner!  It was pricey but worth it.  We should have just stopped there as our lucky streak did not extend to the tables....",

I was very much looking forward to it, especially since I'd never been to an Emeril restaurant (he doesn't have a restaurant in NYC) & I'd been a fan of his through the Food Network for years.  The restaurant was covered in beige, brown, copper, & red colors with splashes of bright neon blue emanating from the center of the restaurant from its circular bar.  I loved the lively atmosphere of the space but, in the end, I wasn't won over by either the service or the food. I guess I expected a lot more \"BAM!\" from this James Beard award-winner celebrity chef but, instead, every dish out of the kitchen was fairly bland & unmemorable: from the gumbo, chowder, fish & meat dishes to the desserts (I got to try a little of everyone's dish).  Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location.  Maybe giving his flagship original in New Orleans another shot is the way to go.",

    "text": "There are several things anyone has a right to expect when encountering one of the plethora of Emeril's restaurants, and a few additional ones that pertain exclusively to the \"NOFH.\" So allow me to recount my recent visit in these terms:  1. Ambience - a five! This is my first visit since they've redone the place, and it soars above the previous incarnation.  2. Service -- a five! It was impeccable. Every person we encountered did their job perfectly.  3. Price -- a four. Ok...it's the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, so you have to expect to pay. The wine list, however, did seem a bit bloated with more one, two and three \"C-note\" bottles than necessary. I had to seak out the lowly $40 Chardonnay befitting my modest budget. The entrees also called for a %-age or two  more pain than might seem necessary.  4. The drinks -- a three. A Hendricks martini with olives -- excellent....but why the additional price? It was good, but no better...and not any larger than the same elsewhere.  5. The entree -- a four. The sea bass special was very good...not any better, however, than many other more moderately priced SB elsewhere.  6. The dessert -- A ZERO. Bread pudding......?!?! Huh??? It was a load of warm, whiskey-hinted [not soaked] cream sauce with a few \"turdlettes\" of bread pudding bobbing to the surface now and then. I must admit, in candor, that I like my BP on the dry side, but even so....this was a tasteless exercise in disappointment. [For those of you who wander in and out of Claremont, CA -- try The Press's version. And you \"Emeril\" people might give it a try too!]  7. The \"hot starter\": MINUS FIVE. Let me spell out what I ordered....so you can \"drink in\" the irony -- M-A-R-Y-L-A-N-D B-L-U-E C-R-A-B C-A-K-E.   This is a \"New Orleans\" restaurant, right?? And isn't blue crab a *specialty*? Well, I was EXPECTING an excellent version of the justly famous MBCC! What I got was something that your local Denny's might THROW AWAY as inferior!! Sure there were *some* flakes of Blue Crab in it....barely discernable from the breading! AND it was coated.....heavily coated with STUFF -- then deep fried!!!! Oh Emeril, Emeril, Emiril....whither goest thou?!?! I'm a devotee of *both* \"Live\" and \"Essence,\" and I know I've seen E himself prepare REAL MBCC's. I expected no less at his NOFH....but received far far far less!! [Just give me a pound or two of fresh lump and a can of Old Bay, and I WILL SHOW YOUR COOKS WHAT TO DO WITH IT.] Maybe the $8 per CC should have tipped me off....instead it just ticked me off!  I'm from Baltimore and I know crab cakes....but these, Mr. Celebrity Chef, were no crab cakes.",

Finally I was able to flag down one member of our \"team\" of waiters and asked about the delay.  He went to check and returned saying he had the manager working on it.  Finally the food arrived.  The shrimp were very tough...overcooked.  The salmon was o.k., nothing special.  The main waiter finally made an appearance when the food was put in front of us, saying \"does everything look perfect?\"  I replied that I hope it is worth the wait.  He didn't even acknowledge there was an issue and never apologized. The long wait and in attentive service means there will not be a return visit.",

For dessert i strongly recommend the banana cream pie..one of the best i've ever had!  If you're in vegas and craving a taste of New Orleans this is the place to go!",

My guess is that people who aren't from areas boasting fresh, abundant seafood might believe the fish they serve here to be \"delicious.\"  The atmosphere tried wayyyyyy too hard to be chic without delivering (not unique menu offerings, nor inspired cocktails).  The appetizers were a joke!  We ordered the shrimp and were presented with 3 for approximatley $18 .  They weren't particularly special...grilled with overpoweringly spicey sauce.  I ordered a bowl of the fish stew (bland city) and a side of calamari (mostly tenticles). My order, without drinks or tax or tip, came to about $65 .  No one in the group enjoyed their meal.  For about $100/person, you could enjoy a much finer vegas dining establishment.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I was totally underwhelmed.  I went here for my birthday last weekend and it was like...blah.  I've heard GREAT things about Emeril's other restaurants and thought that he would have interjected some of the same energy, etiquette and pointers on presentation to this location as well.  I guess what some say about him is True...he may be too busy with his celebrity to care about the food anymore.  What a shame.   This place was accommodating in that I waiting until the last minute to get reservations on a VERY busy Saturday night.  I was told 4 times they were booked solid but thought I would give it one more go in person and was helped by the manager. We had a group of 7 and only had to wait about 10 minutes at 9:00 PM.   The service was apathetic and while the appetizer of seared scallops tasted amazing...that's where the party ended. We ordered calamari to start for the table based on our servers recommendation and it arrived lumped and soggy in a small white bowl with soy sauce dipper bowls of cocktail sauce.  Others in my group ordered the lobster bisque and while it smelled intoxicating, none of what you smell registers when you actually taste it.  I've had MUCH better. 3 ordered the steak and at $45 you get a massive ROAST size lump of meat heaped on a flavor board...and once again, they used small white bowls to present their mashed potatoes.  They also ordered macaroni and cheese on the side for $11 each as they thought the server said it didn't come with a side and sadly, that was the best part of their meals. They did wrap the steaks to go...for their dogs. I had the pecan crusted Texas redfish with grits and while that was tasty I felt a little guilty looking around at the table of my friends with hopeful smiles for my benefit. We decided to forgo dessert but they brought a very small white bowl of mango sorbet with a candle to wrap things up...unfortunately it was so tart none of us could eat it.  As we were leaving we asked if they had any connection or if they could help us with passes for Studio 54 and were completely shocked with the blank response of  \"we're not part of the MGM so we have no affiliation with any of their entertainment venues\".  WHAT?! Aren't we sitting in the MGM at your restaurant??? Flippant attitudes need not apply.  For $130 each with one drink...I would have prefered to go anywhere else for less.  I used to be a huge fan and can honestly say I'll never be back.   I don't like to end reviews on a bad note so I will say the decor was rich and modern and I loved the wine display cases...inspiring option for my own place.",

That drink was really, really strong! Wonder why? Because it was ALL lychee vodka in a freakin' martini glass. Are you serious? So, it was really like 3 straight up lychee flavored vodka shots in a fancy little martini glass. Not worth the money. If you're going to come here, don't waste your money on the tasting menu... save it for steak or something else that will fill your tummy. At least you'll come out full. Won't be coming back here again....",

But his restaurants, on the other hand, actually showcase some of his cooking talents. I had a stomachache before coming here, so I was in no mood to eat a huge meal. I'm used to New Orleans gumbo (which is the best) and my mother's, so I'm spoiled, but this was definitely memorable. My date ordered the surf and turf, which was a filet mignon and crab dish with these great potatoes.

I think I would have been fine paying for a bucket of that for my meal instead of what I actually got. Not that the cornmeal fried oysters or po' boy were bad, they just didnt do anything for me. The po' boy especially seemed to be all bread, I don't even recall at this point...and I have a memory like an elephant...what the hell was in it. The one thing about Vegas I wish would change is that more high end restaurants would be open during lunch hrs so people can try there fare for 'fairer' prices, even if its still expensive, heck...I'm on vacation...and it;s better than having to settle for another one of Emeril's crappy restaurants.",

Traffic was horrible and we were late for our reservation, but when we arrived 25 minutes late, they still took us and didn't give us any grief. Whew! They seated us right away and when our waiter came to our table, the first thing out of his mouth was \"Welcome and Happy Birthday!\" How cool is that to be greeted that way! We had a couple of drinks and ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Sea bass Chef's special...both were delicious! The pacing of the meal was perfect and the setting romantic. Our water was constantly refilled without ever having to ask. Since we were already running late, we had asked our waiter for the check so we could make it to the fight. He brought out the check without any fuss, and brought out a scoop of raspberry sorbet for my birthday dessert and again greeted my 'Happy Birthday'. Very understated yet classy, which I appreciated. I had a great dinner there with a great guy and would definitely come back again!",

I normally eat very salty, but this was too salty for me.  If they would just put less salt in the dishes, then I would give it 5 stars for taste and service. The price range was overall not bad for being in Vegas and being Emeril's.  I would consider stopping by again on my next trip to Vegas.",

Unfortunately we had neither at this location.  We went for brunch on Sunday and the menu was very limited.  When I really didn't see what I wanted, I asked if they could just make an omelette.  I don't eat wheat or dairy and this seemed the easiest way to accomplish this.  They told me they couldn't do it.  What high end restaurant can't make an omelette?(I can make one so they should be able to since I saw all the ingredients in other dishes on the menu).  So I was left to order the crab and shrimp in lettuce cups, no sauce.  There was supposed to be avocado on it, but that was missing too.  very tasteless.  My husband's braised hash was just OK-nothing special.  We had eaten at Buchon in Beverly Hills a couple weeks before and the hash there was so much better.  Really disappointing when we know the experience could have been so much more.",

Ugh, it tasted like that supermarket crab dip in between two little rolls.  Avoid the sliders!  Emeril saved a little face with the large Carmel creme brulee, it was done just right, great balance between the sweet and bitter.

The drinks were far too weak for our tastes, but we went through a number (5?  7?  9?) of rounds of them because they were so incredibly cheap.  Like everywhere else in the MGM Grand, the bar staff was completely professional and on top of their game.  While this might warrant enough for a 4 star review outside of Vegas, competition is stiff for business within these hotels.  I simply think NobHill and Wolfgang Puck have a bit more to offer customers of the hotel.",

I kept having to motion to the waiter (bartender) for attention, even tho the place was pretty empty.  The guy was nice though and makes a really delicious tequila shot.  When you sit down they bring you complimentary bread balls and butter.  Literally 2 balls per plate. I love me some balls but these rolls were not worth the calories. They were dry and flavorless...the butter was tasty tho!  For drinks I got  mimosa's with strawberry puree and they were fantastic and my friend said his Jack n Diet's were very strong.  We split the margarita pizza and the BBQ shrimp.  The pizza tasted like one of those 5 dollar pizzas you get from the grocery store.  Actually it was worse.  The dough was unpleasant.  I took one bite and didn't even want a second one.  The shrimp aren't on the menu and I enjoyed them even though my friend thought they were terrible.  I dont know...I guess I was just really dissappointed.  I was hoping for that \"Bam!\" experience and it didn't happen.    The bill was in the hundreds I think, which is pricey considering we only ordered two food items (it was more like a liquid lunch), but hey its Vegas everything is bigger and better (expensive).

    "text": "Lunch with my cousin today. Shes from New Orleans and she misses home. To satisfy her craving for down home cooking we headed here.  We started with some Abita beer, the turbo dog rocks. We moved onto the complimentary onion rolls. They were good, but would have been better if they were warmer. Next up was the red beans and rice, the flavor was good, but I prefer mine with chunks of meat, sausage, pickled pork or ham hocks. The Gumbo was awesome, made with a lip smacking savory roux, it was all about the flavors. Emeril got it right on this baby. BBQ Shrimp was also very good. I am used to it being made with tons of butter, but this was a new twist on a classic dish.  We just HAD to try the banana creme pie. I'm not a big dessert person, but holy S*%$ wow!!!! This was heaven on earth.  Its a great spot for lunch, prices are what you'd expect at Emerils, but the value was good too. The service was quick, effecient and pleasant.  If you stop by the 1/2 price ticket booth in front of the CocaCola store, you can pick up a voucher for 25% off your check, it saved us$9.00. And the voucher is only a buck or two.",

Although it was a a busy busy weekend, Bam! we were seated right away.  Plus points for sitting us right by the glass paneled wall, dinner was fun people watching (saw lots of celebrities and wackos going in for the Pacquaio match) otherwise it would have been just blah.  They gave each of us ONE small bread bun with butter.  Really Emeril??? Bread looks and taste like one of those buns that you could get at a Ralph's supermarket.  It was not warm or fresh from the oven. Tasted like it's been sitting in their kitchen for a couple of hours....OR..maybe they did get it from Ralphs. LOL  Hubby got swordfish and I ordered pork ribs.  Swordfish was kinda boring, served with a really really small portion of vegetables underneath. Almost kind of dry.  pork ribs was a small portion too but its really on the appetizer menu since I wasn't really hungry.   The ribs were tender and the sauce was just right. Not too sticky. I know I said I wasn't hungry but I actually wanted to have more after I finished it.  Pork ribs is really what stopped me from giving this place a two star review. Overall, just ok. No BAM!",

    "text": "First of all, let me say that this place is harder to find than one might think. When you park at the valet in the MGM and then go into the lobby, go left towards the casino and then right. There are signs all over that say \"restaurants\" but they do not say which restaurants. Just an arrow pointing you in different directions. Anyhoo - on to the food. Went in for oysters on the half shell. They had Fanny Bay oysters. Not too bad, but they are served on a bed of spices and salt, not on ice. So the oysters got to room temperature quickly...not a good thing for a fresh oyster. The saving grace was the desert, banana creme pie. That was one of the best deserts I have ever had. Delicious! So why only two stars you ask? Service. Service sucked. the manager seated us, didn't give us menus right away. We ordered just some water with lemon to start off as it was a hot day in Vegas and that took longer than you would have liked to arrive to the table. Then a waitress came back with menus. Just as I was about to say, \"We are just here for oysters\", she walked away. So we waited. Then she came back over to tell us that she would come back for our order in a second. That was a long second. We ordered the food, and an iced tea. The food came, the iced tea didn't. Then she remembered the tea and brought it along with an apology. No break on the bill though. So for 12 oysters an iced tea and one desert the bill was $50. That with the slow service means I can't recommend it.",

    "text": "Had an outstanding meal before watching KA at MGM.  We chose Emeril's over other restaurants nearby, because it seemed like a nicer place that wouldn't hurt our pocketbooks too terribly badly.    Our waiter, Rocco, was excellent!  He deserves 5 stars.  He helped us choose our entrees and desserts, and informed us that the salads were large and that we could easily split one.  He also thanked us for letting him know we were going to see a show after dinner, and ensured us we would be finished in time to go.    The tasting menu (small portions of several dishes) looked very interesting, but we elected not to select this because we might not make it to our show on time (Rocco's advice).  Instead, hubby and I each selected one of the fresh fish offerings for the evening.  Emeril's has 4 or 5 to choose from.  Each came with 3 dipping sauces -- all were delicious.  The fish came with potatoes fried in duck fat (pretty tasty!) and green beans.  The salad was good, too, although I was surprised that we had to divide and plate our split salad ourselves.    My creme brulee was good, and the cookies that came with it were even better!  It was like getting 2 desserts!  Hubby had the famous banana creme pie, and it was awesome!",

Where do I start, drinks, they offer a wide variety of drinks. I had a specialty drink called New Orleans nectar, it was very refreshing but at $13/ea, don't go overboard..   The bread sold me on this place, they were served warm lightly buttered on top and extremely fluffy. I would love that job, walking around with a platter of buns.. well it was Vegas, what would you expect..   I had the rib eye steak, which was recommended by the server, I have to say this was the most flavorful steak I have ever had. It was served with a trinity of vegetables and smashed potatoes, AWESOME is an understatement.   My husband had the BBQ Salmon with the sausage and potato hash, at first he was unsure of the combo but was happy he stuck with it, he loved it..   He has enjoyed dinner at the New Orleans location and that does not compare to the very casual dining experience in Las Vegas. Lets just say it was very interesting to watch what people were wearing.. daisy dukes in a restaurant, please..    We also had dessert, the brownie was light and fluffy, the walnut chocolate chip oatmeal cookie was very good but the best part was the cookies and cream ice cream that came with it. The coffee was also amazing..   The service was good, they were very attentive, they better have been since we were a party of 6, they automatically added at 18% tip.   I would say dinner for 2 for under $200 is a bit pricey but for a special occasion, well worth it..   Next time we just go for dessert..",

Service was outstanding here as there was a VIP in our party and the manager came over to say hello etc.  We ordered the BBQ Salmon and Whitefish along with some Filet Mignon Medallions as an appetizer.  (the medallions are not on the menu)  The filet medallions were served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  Although tasty I felt the medallions were overcooked as they were definately not melt in your mouth.  The salmon was delicious cooked perfectly but  was served with some onion strings that had lost all sense of crispy/crunchy goodness therefore they became a liability on the plate.  The whitefish was so mild, I found it hard to find any flavor in it.  Don't order the whitefish if you are hoping for Emeril's BAAM flavoring.  Everything was good here, but again the pricing is a wee bit on the high side.  I believe my salmon was $36 and came with no sides.  If you want to try one of Emeril's places I would suggest the Delmonico Steakhouse or perhaps Fish House at lunch time as I have seen a lot of favorable reviews for their lunch service.",

For dessert, their banana cream pie is the best.",

    "text": "Lessaiz Les Bon Temps Rouler in Viva Las Vegas,  Came here for dinner with the BFF's to celebrate all of our belated birthday's. I've actually dined at several of Emeril's establishment and have been here twice before.  Each time I enjoyed a very good meal here.    We started off with drinks and shared 2 different salads which were very good.  Pork chop was my entree <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#LC_f_i6ryK2FE9A0o1iX_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>  This sounded really good and it was very good.   A nice double cut pork chop atop a very creamy and flavorful mashed potato. The sauce that accompanied the chops was perfect I wanted more of it.  It was a pretty big piece of pork chop.  Banana cream pie <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#JmSeIq-NF3TojwbkY71V9A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>  For dessert it is a must for me to get the Banana cream pie.  I first had it at Delmonico's in New Orleans and ever since the first bite many many years ago, if its on the menu at any Emerils resto I'm ordering it.  As you can see it not just all custard but it has slices of fresh banana's and the custard is firmer.  Its just tasty bite after bite!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#4j2ZIrDR8_5Jkwid9ahUqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>  Eyes ~ Lots of happy diners! Nose ~ I smell something yummy. Ear ~ Plenty of chatter but not too loud  Mouth ~ Pork chops and Banana cream pie goodness!. Tummy ~ So very stuffed!",

I recommend the clam chowder and the seared steak. We also upgraded our dessert for and additional $4.00. It was totally worth it and allowed us to try the pecan pie, bread pudding, chocolate cake and the banana pudding. We liked the desserts in that order. We enjoyed this establishment so much on our vacation that we also came here for happy hour. The drinks are very reasonable and the cornbread melts in your mouth. I can't end this review without letting everyone know how nice all of the Emeril's staff was, especially our dinner waiter V.J., he truly made our evening special. Customer service is key and combined with great food it created an unforgettable evening on our vacation,",

On a recent busy night at emerils , we were a party of 13.  The service was frenzied but solid.   The food however was neither frenzied nor solid. It was honestly, quite subpar.   The appetizers were actually pretty good. Crabby crab cakes, a plentiful seafood tower, everything was fresh and tasty.   Until the entree. A $38 Seabass came solo on a plate, with a few tomatoes and lettuce leaves flanking it.  This is not a steakhouse and fish should come with at least a potato.  The fish itself was oily and flavorless, with a hint of fishiness. The promise lemon caper sauce came halfway through the meal in little cups.    Because we were in such a big group, nothing was sent back but for those prices, Emeril can do better.",

And had beverages quickly there after. The server was also highly knowledgeable on the food items, and was able to offer some really good suggestions.   The establishment, appeared clean. Nice decor. Seating wasn't too cramped. It definitely was a nice ambiance and environment, even while located in a Busy walk area between hotels.   The food came out not too long also. Food was hot. Presentation was nice. And the food was also delicious. What else more can you ask for? Great mix of flavor and spices. Definitely had that southern taste and feel you expect when eating at Emerils.   Not to forget to mention the beverages. Also delicious, with nice presentation.   A little pricey...but hey, it's Vegas.  Would I go back and eat there again? Absolutely.",

Gentle twangs of Cajun music harkened back to the flagship restaurant in New Orleans, which I visited last summer. I like the casual-but-hip feel better here.  When you dine in a certain stratosphere, you stop expecting free things. This made the complimentary (and perfectly moist) cornbread a nice surprise.  We started with the pulled pork mofongo, which was an explosion of salty goodness. The plantains had a quality like eggplant that I liked.  They were stingy with the shrimp in the shrimp po boy (only 8 on a massive roll). But the flavors were good, and the accompanying Cajun fries were excellent. The salmon was also flawlessly prepared on a tasty bed of quinoa slaw.   The fried chicken sandwich was over cooked, but the manager happily credited us the price of the sandwich.   We were full after the meal, but we got a complimentary banana cream pie that was layered with fresh banana slices. It was so decadent and yet so fresh. We ate the whole thing.  I wish it wasn't buried so deeply inside the MGM Grand maze, otherwise we'd go more often.",

Amazing texture and it has a good balance taste and it is NOT salty. (5/5)  Beef short ribs came with mashed potatoes and it was cooked to amazing tenderness.  Well balanced flavors and it is seasoned throughly. Again, not salty but good consistency taste.  Could have used some veggies like roasted asparagus to balance it more (4/5)  The creme brulee...  first of all,  amazing portion..  super tasteful and good pairing with some mandarin and biscotti to balance the sweetness variety.

    "text": "Came here for happy hour before a concert and the food they have is mediocre at best. The Angud beef sliders were dry and not that appetizing. Also ordered the Tuna Pike and that was probably the better dish out of their happy hour menu. Their gumbo was too salty for my taste and didn't really have much flavor to it. They definitely have the potential to improve their food quality but then again, it was happy hour so I didn't expect high end quality food for a fraction of the cost.   On the plus side, the atmosphere is great for dates and/or just hanging out, especially at the bar.",

We had reservations at this place Saturday 19,2019  Before the Pacquiao Broner Fight, upon entering the restaurant this guy in the photos attached  GRABBED MY ARM AND! Again he touched me! And with this very aggressive tone told me and my husband we couldn't come in, instantly I was shocked, I asked why? He said because my husband was too loud!!? Hmm?! Okay so I let my husband know that we could go In,  My husband doesn't take disrespect very well and left 200$ on the check in desk, ( his way of saying, \"what you think I don't have money?!\") as we were was walking away he said something that I didn't quiet catch but it was a an insult from the look of his face and body language , it took me about five minutes to react at what just had happened, we had a party inside already seated and waiting for us to dine. Well anyhow I know that this was wrong so I go back to take a picture,  reason that I needed proof, the racist asshole calls security on me, like a little bitch because I took his picture, once security arrived his whole demeanor change to \"nice guy\"; security pretty much because we did nothing!? There was no problem- He (white man) then says oh, I just want to give you your money back, we said no keep it it's cool, he insisted, we didn't want it back so i told him to apply it to the Medina party! My mistake because we should of let them know they had a 200$ credit, we end up at China Tang right across from Emeril's where Simon the Restaurant manager was soo nice he had witnessed a the incident, yet had no problem with us, and my loud husband lol. After dinner we meet up with our party that did dine at Emeril's, only to learn that they paid for the full balance on check and no credit was applied to the bill? He kept the money hahahahaha!  So I really hope he looses his job, after this post is made, as a business owner, these types of employees are what make the business go down, rude, aggressive and lack of conduct, Given! You have the right to refuse service to anyone, but I think the approach was done in a unprofessional and humiliating matter. For that reason I posted this.",

It was delicious. I got the bbq shrimp (5) which came in a brown sauce with a biscuit. Delicious. They also bought out cornbread which was warm and sweet. The main course I selected was the pan fried trout with tomato and string beans. It was nicely plated and delicious. My friend had the scallops in a white sauce. It was much better than my meal. For dessert I had the chocolate cake which was too much after 2 bites. My friend had the warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious.   The waiter noticed that I didn't like the chocolate cake so he offered to bring me the bananas foster but I'm allergic to bananas. I settle for the warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. My friend had the house red wine and he really enjoyed it.   I will definitely return. The service was outstanding but I wouldn't expect less since we had 3 waiters.",

Anyway let me start of with the pan fried rainbow trout with lump crab. It was delicious but the portion size and presentation was just not impressive. My appetizer not shown jumbo lump crab cake was amazing so amazing i forgot to take a pic all crab no filler which made me happy.  Desert was my favorite part the chocolate torte  man oh man it was heavenly and presented beautifully,  expect to pay $70 min per person not including drinks.  There is no bathroom but once you walk out the restaurant there is one to your left. The waiters serve your meals together in courses which is nice. You aren't rushed. Also nice. I will be back but next time a better portion of the rainbow trout please!",

The food was served promptly as well.   Even though the service was good I was not impressed with the food. I ordered the chicken dish and it came with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. I also ordered a side dish of asparagus. Both these dishes were just ok. I think that for the price paid for each dish it should have been better. There was nothing really special about the asparagus and I was expecting more since this is a side dish that is over $15. The chicken had good flavor, but again not worth the price. I think this restaurant needs to reinvent their menu. I have visited NOLA many times and there was nothing about this place that reminded me of my time in that city. When I go to NOLA I enjoy eating charbroiled oysters and beignets. I did not see these two items represented in the menu.   Overall I had fun with my friends but I would wait until this restaurant changes their menu for me to come back.",

It was rich and very tasty with plenty of substance.  Wanted more one of the best.  Onto the main course, I ordered the trout topped with crab.  I believe it is butter reduction sauce.  Very good and crispy with tomatoes breaking up each bite.  Highly recommended.",

The ambiance is good - however, we were seated toward the back left with a \"lovely\" view of the food court (McDonald's!).    Service is great - perfect level of attentiveness.  They keep your water full but don't get in your way.   We had the \"grand tasting menu\" and it was grant.  Six (or seven?) courses - at least half of the menu, but smaller sizes.     I don't want to give the impression that I didn't love it - because I did.  But for the price and reputation, I wanted to see/taste/experience a bit of culinary risk.   None, in my opinion, was taken.   Everything was safe, and rather traditional.  Nothing made me go \"ahhhh\" or \"WOW\".  In fact, I'm having a hard time recalling the tasting items (I do remember the bread pudding).   I would be curious to know how often the menu changes.   For the price, next time, I'm more likely to try something else.",

There are an overwhelming number of choices available in every Casino, but even though this was in the MGM, it was fairly calm inside with nice soothing decor.... now onto the food!  There were so many things on the menu we wanted to try so we shared multiple appetizers and left room for desert.    We started with the LOBSTER SALAD which was so good we wanted more, the lobster was fresh & tender, served over a bed of very young/tender mache lettuce with a very light but creamy dressing.    My husband loves the SCALLOPS, so he had the scallop appetizer and they just melted in your mouth (I had a small bite). The sauce drizzled on the side was tangy and perfect for the scallop and the spinach was to die for (was marinated in something delicious - I gobbled it all up).   We shared the GUMBO and being a southern gal myself, I have to say it was very good, not spicy though. I've had Gumbo many ways and enjoy most all ways but like it best when the Gumbo is not too thick. This was on the thick side but still great.   I had ordered one of the new items on the menu, the FOIE GRAS with Blackberry jam, which came in small slices, drizzled in a bit of bb jam, a few crackers and a small bowl of blackberry jam on the side. I absolutely loved this, it was tender and flavorful and with the jam on top.. yum!!! This is not a regular menu item, so you may not find it.  Then of course, desert... my husband had the KEY LIME MOUSSE which had the perfect amount of key lime flavor, was almost frozen it was so cold and it melted on your tongue like butter.  I being southern, had to have the BANANA CREAM PIE, and no lie, it was light & fluffy, with wonderful curls of thin chocolate on top.   The SERVICE you ask?  The staff, was so friendly and wonderful, made sure we got out in time for our show and brought us bread & tea until we had to ask them to stop!  ALL IN ALL IT WAS THE BEST MEAL IN VEGAS!!! A MUST if you are a lover of creative & different dishes.",

I want favors to enhance already wonderful foods, not mask them.  When you pay a higher price for a meal you have a higher expectation for service and the quality of the food.

    "text": "6 adults and 1 child for family dinner.  We had reservation so no wait. Ordered appetizers frog legs and crab cakes, both were delicious -- actually the crab cake was exceptional. Frog legs was tender and the seasoning was good, similar to buffalo wings only it's the leg of frogs.  The kids even liked them. Next came the soups--two orders each of gumbo and clam chowder. Delicious on both counts: not salty, ingredients in the soup were not over or under cooked which can happen in gumbos and chowders. The entrees were 3 pan roast jambalaya and two seafood pasta (forgot actual name). Yeah it could have been more varied but everyone wanted what they wanted. Overall good taste and fresh (we have one in our party with shrimp allergy and was able to eat the shrimps without even a mild reaction meaning: fresh).    Service was good. They use a tag team system so two servers attended to our table. Christian and Gil both did a solid job. We ordered five bottles of sparkling water but didn't consume the fifth. I mention this point bc they poured water for us and could have easily opened the last one but instead they were observant and automatically took it off the bill.    We were too full for dessert but decided to order a beignet to share for the heck of it. Sauce was good but the fried dough was just ok.   Overall it was a great experience. With gratuity the dinner came to just over $500. We read other reviews about how they felt their meal was pricey or not the value for the amount spent. It's a featured restaurant in a resort hotel folks .. so expect to pay more for the experience and adjust expectations accordingly.  We think it's a disservice to both the restaurant and future patrons to give the restaurant a good review for food and service then ding it down a star or two bc it was \"expensive\".  We budgeted well in advance for the dinner so when the bill came it didn't surprise us or disturb the good time we were having.",

The warm cornbread that they give you is delicious - very moist but the shrimp po boy left something to desire.  The shrimp were fine but it was served on this toasted French roll, where usually toasting makes a roll nice and soft, this one wasn't so I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh.  I expected po boys to be messy to eat but the bread made it even more difficult.  It was probably a six inch roll and they didn't cut the sandwich in half, but it's served in a basket so it's not easy to cut yourself.  The roll was dry in a way where the bread kind of breaks apart when you bit into it so the bread is falling apart as you're trying to hold it.  Just disappointing.",

I hope Emeril just received some cash for putting his name on the restaurant.  It isn't horrible, but it is not good either.    First, it is extremely loud.  I am talking Motley Crue Concert loud.  Second, the waitors act like it is a Five Star establishment. \"Emeril personally created these dishes and each is meticulously made with blah blah blah.\"  Ok...cool...so why do my fried calamari taste like fried rubber bands?  Third, they have an extensive wine list...sorta.  Who would want wine anyway when you are eating food that is comparable to Red Lobster?  \"Should I have a white wine with my frozen fried shrimp\" *pinky in the air.  We had a trip and part of that trip involved a concert...we were early and decided to eat.  This was the place we visited because it was an Emeril establishment.  This is one of the worst restaurants I have visited in Vegas.  Do not fall for the tourist trap.  I need to make a Las Vegas Tourist Trap list so everybody will be wiser.  I despise places like this because they take advantage of tourists by flashing a famous chef name and hoping you take the bait.    Well, I took the bait and now I am stuffed on the wall with an inscription that reads \"Tourist Trap Dope.\"",

The very good waiter suggested that the Salmon should be medium rare (just the way I like it).  What I got was cold fried potato chunks with cold dry sausage chunks underneath an over cooked salmon.  The so-called homemade Worcestershire sauce didn't appear to  be anywhere.  A sweet, unpleasant barbecue sauce was scattered around the plate.  To top it off, the \"onion crust\" was cold, soggy onion strings.  I don't know how all of the items that need to be fresh off the grill could be so cold and soggy while the Salmon was over cooked.  Yuck!  At least the Willamette valley Pinot Noir was excellent.  My wife had one of the worst crab cakes that she has ever had to go along a very boring salad.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "I was here with my boyfriend in December and we had such a lovely experience, our servers were incredible they have duo servers, so you get 2 servers checking on you, we had a male pair and they were so amazing if only i got their names, it was my birthday and they even brought a sorbet with a candle in it after we are finished with our dinner, which was delicious, I got a fish special, the mahi mahi with lemon bearnaise sauce, it was so good. So after this lovely experience we decided to go back to this restaurant when we visited Vegas again for my spring break. Needless to say the service wasn't as great...  We had a blonde girl (don't remember her name might've been Emily) and a guy named Michael, Michael was pleasant although I ordered a fish special and it took him about half an hour later to tell me that they ran out of the Escolar, I ordered the Sea Bass instead but at the point of waiting my bf and I were done with our glasses of champagne, so emily came around and asked if we wanted another glass and we said yes. 20 minutes pass by and our food arrives, mind you we had to wait an hour for our food, and on top of that Emily never came back with the other glasses of champagne. I had a horrible experience and was so saddened that it fell short from our first experience there, we were genuinely upset but we aren't complainers so we didn't say anything to management. After Dinner we did spot the servers that we had the first time around and we told them how we wished we had them as servers that night, will we come back? yes, but we are requesting the first pair of servers we got!",

I ordered the mahi mahi and it was very plain and bland.  The side dishes and appetizers we had were not exceptional and one was disliked by a number of the diners  at our table (the shrimp).  We were a party of eight and the overall reaction was one of disappointment by all since many of us have eaten here before.

They took New Orleans style and elevated it to a very high level.  Normally when I eat out there is always at least one dish that I don't really like but all of the ones we tried were spectacular, especially the perfectly prepared risotto (something that is really hard to find in the US) and the extremely tender, melt in your mouth beef tenderloin with a sauce to die for.  I'd recommend going for the prix fixe menu if you're hungry as all the selections were great and portions were very generous.  To top things off the bread and butter bread pudding was unbelievably creamy apple cinnamon deliciousness and the banana cream pie was light and fluffy but packing a rich banana cream flavor with a nice crunchy crust. All in all a fabulous meal that I would do again in a heartbeat.",

First the positives: great service, and the bread and butter pudding with whiskey sauce is absolutely outrageously delicious.  The sweet barbeque'd salmon was perfectly cooked, but I'm not sure I am one for a sweet sauce on my salmon - that's my own personal preference, so I wouldn't knock the restaurant for it.  Quail appetizer was quite nice.  Negatives: pork chop was dry, savory pudding side dish served with the pork was good but just a bit too salty for my taste.  And \"agast!\" the beignets were dry and hard...a cardinal sin for a New Orleans-style restaurant to mess up the beignets.  For shame!  All in all, the restaurant had a nice atmosphere, great service and pretty good food.  With so many great restaurants in Vegas, you may be better off going somewhere else for your dinner, but hitting Emeril's for the bread & butter pudding for dessert!",

    "text": "This place can be summed up with one word, ewwwww! I ate here the other night with a party of 7. It wasn't my choice and I was pretty sure it was going to be bad, but it was disgusting. Forget the service, the decor, the drinks, I'm just going to stick to reviewing the food. Stone crab claws were obviously not available so we weren't able to try those, but I'm confident they would have been gross just like everything else. We started with 2 dozen oysters, a dozen of each kind on the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up oysters, but these were dry and smelly, a clear sign that they weren't fresh. Next we ordered the chopped salad which was one of the most disgusting things I can recall having eaten in my entire life. The dressing was bland and tasted like they sprinkled some water with a touch of salt and pepper and the quality of the salad and vegetables itself was pathetic (frozen maybe???). Everything was just soggy and tasted like these rinsed everything under a faucet and plated it. I immediately sent it back and didn't bother to order anything else. For our entree we had a grilled whole white fish which was the least offensive item of the evening, but still wasn't that good and it could have been fresher and better prepared. I am typically pretty forgiving of restaurants for making a mistake or trying something that didn't quite work, but this restaurant was consistently bad every step of the way and it's clearly a place that lacks quality ingredients and staff who care about the food they cook and serve. Please please don't go here, you will be utterly disappointed. Emeril you should be ashamed to have your name on this restaurant.",

Our waiter was almost rude and didn't give very good recommendations when it came to the wine. He would also come and clear our plates while people would be in mid conversation - just butting in rather than waiting for the person to finish like most well trained waiters at nice establishments should and do. The food more than made up for this though. Although the menu is indeed not very extensive, I thought everything we tried was delicious. I came here with a fairly large group and since none of us could make a decision about what we wanted to order, we decided to just order a bunch of things and share them. This isn't really a \"family style\" type of place but it worked out just fine for all of us.... although the waiter was rude about it, huffing under his breath \"that won't be enough food\". He clearly wanted each of us to order three courses and drop more money. He was also visibily irritated when we didn't order multiple bottles of wine. Anyway, back to the food: for appetizers we ordered the braised short rib beef ravioli which was awesome. It came on top of a bed of celery root puree which had a really great flavor. We also got the fried calamari with pepperoncini, tomato and cucumber salad that had a really great spicy kick to it, and also the salad the of the day which had blue crabmeat, apple, and candied pecans which was also wonderful and light. For entrees we got the monkfish which was on the specials list which was delicious and buttery, the ribeye which was cooked perfectly and the chicken that was also delicious and flavorful and juicy. We got a side of jambalaya which was amazing and also the bourbon sweet potato puree which was amazingly rich. The desserts were what really made this meal though. We got a special white chocolate bread pudding which was really one of the best desserts I've ever had, along with an impressive cheesecake and a caramel pecan torte.",

I don't like eating alone and so I chose to sit at the bar for a late lunch.  The server working the bar was extremely friendly and able to give me wonderful suggestions both on the lunch menu and on wines by the glass.  I had an amazing burger - I know, I know - but it was too good to pass up.  It had blue cheese and portabello mushrooms on it with a homemade mayo and portwine ketchup.  I saw several other dishes go by that looked equally delicious.  Also, the cornmuffins and sweet roll that accompanies all meals are not to be passed up.

The soup of the day was butternut squash-- which doesn't sound particularly exciting but i was on a butternut squash kick at the time. Boy was I glad i got it! It was the BEST I've ever had. The reason? Somehow, they managed to incorporate meat into it. I could taste it- i SWEAR i could. But I couldn't actually make it out. I know.. sounds a mysteriously scary, but the best I can figure is that they perhaps minced or blended some pork or beef and brewed it with the soup. In any case, it was PERFECT and i could drink it for days! My bf who is strictly carnivore & cringed when i offered him a taste quickly changed his tune and kept asking for more. I will definitely be back, and this time I will be ready to throw down some heartier meals.",

    "text": "a few of us went to vegas for thanksgiving day weekend and while we were walking around MGM hotel we came across this place and thought - dood we gotta eat here, this is the BAM! guy. so, we made reservations that night and i gotta admit it's a big disappointment. a friend ordered a chicken dish, another peep ordered a fish dish w/ some sort of bbq sauce and another fella ordered the rib eye and i got the grand chef testing menu.   so here's the dillyo (out of 5 star)   appetizer:  - gumbo - 2.4 star... dood this dish was disappointing... it's like a wannabe man's new orlean's gumbo. i mean, i get it - u gotta \"vegas'nize\" the flavor but geez c'mon... you're EMERIL the BAM! guy... known for strong authentic new orleans flavor! so sad... and what's with that little pot u pour from into the bowl??? that's sorta whack.  food:  - chicken dish - 4 star - pretty daymn good  - fish dish with some sort of shoestring onion ring and bbq sauce - 3 star - ribeye (med rare) - 3 star (it's swimming in sorta funky smoky tart sauce - but that's subjective to taste of course)  - grand chef tasting menu - 2.5 star - oh... this was the MOST disappointing for $85 you sorta would think that none of the dishes would remind u of a carl's junior western bacon cheeseburger... rt??? ok so if i remember correctly - the gran chef tasting is...1 some sort of lobster salad (it's actually good but somewhat mushy) 2. a scallop dish (this was the best dish) 3. a bbq fish dish that reminded of carl's junior western bacon cheeseburger in taste 4. pork tenderloin (pretty daymn good, but that tomato cooley sauce wasn't my thing) and a few others... there was NO dish that made me go wow... i once ate at masushito's in beverly hills and ordered their $150 tasting menu and that shit made me go wow... i would say avoid the tasting menu and go with a stand alone item.   service:  3 star... the people were very very very nice but they never could repeat the chef tasting menu from heart... they ALWAYS forgot and to check their notes. it's not a big deal but if u have top tier price u better come with ur A game service.   so... would i come here again? sadly no... but i'll try his steakhouse - i heard the prime rib is divine.",

I got pork ribs that had a nice kick to it because it included a lime infused barbecue sauce, with a really nice slaw that had bellpepers onions and some other things to sweeten it up. I hate bellpeppers and onions and i hate coleslaw, but I loved this. Emeril definitely kicked it up a notch for me. My girlfriend got a Po'Boy Sandwich of Oysters, which was okay.. In my opinion it was a little bland, she seemed to like Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill better. I liked this much more. Id say stay away from Po' Boy sandwiches and get a real entree, you shouldnt be disappointed!",

For lunch, my husband and I shared the barbecued shrimp appetizer--flavorful and perfectly prepared.  He had a burger made with beef, pork, and bacon for his entree and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I went for the fried oyster po' boy--I could have used more remoulade sauce, but I didn't ask...was too lazy and too hungry.  We were both too full for dessert, but the servers told us that it's not uncommon for people to come back later, and sit at the bar for an afternoon or evening dessert.  The service was excellent--absolutely no complaints or criticisms.  If there is a drawback, it's a bit on the high side in price, but it's Vegas and it's Emeril's.",

It was very empty, but you would have thought they were slammed at how furious an 8 top table didn't have reservations. So then we get seated and our waiter asks for our drink orders. He was very irritated none of us ordered alcohol. A specific quote, \"8 adults and all I have is waters and 2 iced teas? Really people, start acting your age.\" It was not said in a joking tone and made several in the group very agitated. Then, he commented on the fact that we all ordered from the lunch menu and did not want any appetizers (\"You all are really watching the purse strings, huh?). We were so angry by the time our food came (did I mention it took forever??), we could not wait to leave. I would definitely never recommend it nor would I return.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend went to Vegas last month just for the weekend and decided to eat at Emerils Fish house. My boyfriend ordered the gumbo and it was terrible !! There was no shrimp in it and it tasted like it came out of a can he spoke with the waiter and he said that they were rock shrimp so there small lol!! ummm you should still be able to see them!! So he sent back the gumbo and got a po boy the bread was really hard so he just ate the meat inside he told the waiter and he said he would let the chef know. Our lunch was very disappointing so much so that I went to Emerils website and sent an email I received a callback from Scott Barber (director of operations) 702-429-3827.  He spoke with my boyfriend and was very condescending and went on to tell him that their chefs are sent to school for $3k and if you have never been to Louisianna then how would you know good gumbo? wow talk about terrible customer service and ended the call with \" I'm not going to comp you the next time your out here but maybe I'll buy you a sandwich what an a&^hole!!  I did email them after that to let them know how Rude scott barber was but SURPRISE NO REPSONSE !! so just to let others know I hope you have a better experience than we did !",

It being the middle of the Consumer Electronics Show all the restaurants were booked solid.  Finding a seat was a bad omen I should not have ignored.  Start with the bread..two smallish round rolls...cold...hard (it being a dry climate in the Nevada) ..oh, did I mention how bad they tasted? ..that too.  one of the rolls was actually a pretzel...sounds like a trendy cool idea but they are dinner rolls...I did not think I was at a carnival (that is until I got my entree)  I ordered the Kale salad...super sweet...and this is from a salad eater who loves it sweet...it was too sweet for me...only half finished.  For my entree I ordered the seafood pasta...what  got was three mussels, four clams and a pile of spaghetti in dirty dishwater sauce ...oh, yummo.  ...oh yes...to make the dishwater stew look more presentable it was sprinkled with some crab meat (I guess that is what it was) and some green leaf crumbs,,,(green perfume on this pig of a dish)    The servers humped their butts off so I have to give them props for hard work...hooray for them, but it simply can't overcome the overpriced under-flavored junk I was served...don't know where Emril's \"bam\" went...but it certainly didn't go into the food prep  POST SCRIPT:  The manager contacted me personally to discuss my review and I appreciate that he took the time to address my meal.  I know that running a business is difficult and sometimes in the rush quality can suffer.  I will try them again next time I am in Las Vegas",

But it was over my bad expectation of food quality and atmosphere of this shabby and poor restaurant. Out of 6 we ordered, a couple was so bad with overlooked and over salted. Maybe Emeril was too busy to check the food serving there. One was good, which was mussels as appetizer, others are just average at Denny's level of restaurants.  Then I was suffered from smokers inside of restaurant and, nobody from the restraint employees cared about it. I believe even Las Vegas, smoking is banned at any restaurants.  I cannot rate this restaurant more than 1 star, which means they should be closed and gone.",

I wasn't exactly excited when my man told me his company holiday dinner was going to be here but I was very pleasantly surprised since I never had any desire to dine here.   The private dining room is beautiful & overlooks the entire restaurant. The staff was incredible paying attention to every single one of our needs. From start to finish it was a very enjoyable experience. My drink of choice for the entire evening was a belvedere with 7 and a lime.   The first course we had a Caesar (nothing special) and a kale salad with walnuts & a raisin vinaigrette (loved it). Next course was some alligator balls (wasn't into the texture) and BBQ shrimp with a warm mini biscuit (delicious). Next came out the main courses, I had the BBQ salmon which was really good & my man had a steak with rosemary mashed potatoes (amazing). Our last course which was dessert was my least favorite of the evening. The banana cream pie was ok, and my chocolate lava cake was paired with some cherry sauce & a scoop of peanut butter marscapone (weird combo) the cake itself was very good. My night ended with a cappuccino & overall we had a great time.",

    "text": "This is one of the best parts of my stay in Las Vegas last month, Superbowl weekend. My friend and I ate here on friday night before karaoke at a nearby bar. I insisted on it as I was always a big fan of Emeril Lagasse on the Food Network, with his show \"Emeril Live\". I just HAD to experience this cuisine.  the first thing when you walk through the MGM Grand area and into the restaurant is that the decor is designed like the \"Emeril Live\" set with the bar area looking very similar to the \"Emeril Live\" set, so I was hit with a flood of nostalgia that felt great. I'm glad we had a reservation, but even without that, I was glad we arrived at a time when it wasn't too busy. We were seated and given frequent service by our waitress.  I honestly can't remember if my friend and I ordered any drinks, but we definitely remember the dinner and dessert well. I ordered the barbecued organic Scottish Salmon dish and my friend ordered the herb-roasted free range chicken breast. Both our dishes were divine! the barbecue glaze on each dish was smokey, spicy and sweet in all the right ways, and the sides in each dish as well as the main parts were great and cooked well. It was very tasty and exactly what I would have expected of a dish Emeril would have created for a restaraunt.  The dessert (which I tried looking up and I'm guessing they don't have anymore) was a almond or chesnut induced cheesecake-like cake with raspberry or strawberry sauce and that was good. Sadly neither of us could finish it, though I got about 3 quarters of the way to finishing it.  I asked the waitress how often Emeril stops by this restaurant and she said its not too often but once every month or couple months, and that he actually came by the week before. I was thinking \"damnit! if only I was able to come the week before. I could have met a childhood favorite.\"  This restaurant was amazing and I definitely want to go back. It was well worth the money, which for this trip I saved for the purpose of splurging while in Vegas.",

VERY organized, VERY friendly, VERY accommodating. If something was missed another person got on it!.. It was fascinating to watch all of them work! This VERY nice to see and experience!....   Okay, we started with the Fanny Bay oysters (per. our server recommendation) and the crab cake!.. OH-OH-WOW!!!!!.... The oysters WHERE ON-MYY DELICIOUS!!!!... The watermelon mignonette with lemon and sauce.... WAS PERFECT!!... The crab cake.... Oh WOW.... The crab cake was just THAT!... All crab and less filling!. The remoulade sauce and greens were FANTASTIC additions!!!... Emeril's crab cake it probably second ONLY to the infamous Michael Jordan's crab cake here in Chicago!!.. I knew RIGHT THEN....the entre was going to just as GREAT; and IT DEFINITELY was. My wife got the special of the day which was a pasta dish. She LOVEDDDD it!!!!.. Pasta wasn't over cooked and the sauce was great!... The sun-dried tomatoes added just enough pop of flavor. I got the pecan crusted Texas Redfish!... Listen....... (read rather)... That was probably the BEST fish dish I have ever had in my ENTIRE adult life (THUS FAR)!!... It came with pepper jack grits, vegetable ratatouille and meuniere sauce......! I will leave it at that!. There were NO words as to how good this meal was... CRAZY SONS!!..... WOW! WOW!. WOW!... BAM!!!...  We finished off with Sorbet and pecan pie. The pie was RICH.... But not overbearing. You didn't have to drown yourself in water while eating it. The sorbet was a little much for even two people. The portion could be cut in half and be fine. Mixing both together was a nice clean eating to the overall meal. We both left not full, but VERY content!..   Bam!.....",

We enjoyed drinks for about an hour and was seated for dinner around 7pm.  For dinner, I ordered the pan roasted striped sea bass with basil pesto and polenta.  The chef was really good about making sure there was no tomatoes in my food.  I originally wanted sea bass specialty but he informed me it wouldn't be a good idea with my ulcer (since it was prepared with lots of lemon).  The girls also ordered some Mac n cheese, mash potatoes, and Jambalaya to share.  They were okay.  I had a piece of my girlfriends salmon, which was also okay.  For dessert, we shared the Banana Cream Pie.  Yum!  I definitely recommend the sea bass and the pie here.    The service was awesome here.  From the bartenders to the waiters.  They were extremely helpful and all request were met perfectly.  My only complaint was that the food came out ultra slow.  Also, we originally called in to reserve a table at 5:30.  They said there was no reservation then and only 7:30 was available.  That's weird because we when arrived at 5:30 for happy hour, there was plenty of seating available.  We didn't understand why they didn't take our reservation.  The hostess also was not friendly.    Overall, I am happy we came here for dinner.  We left satisfied and happy.  I would come back.",

The portion size was just right. Each table is provided with a basket of cornbread to go with the food. The shrimp was a nice size and wasn't the salad shrimp like many places use in the gumbo. The gumbo is well seasoned. It's a little spicy but not overly spicy.   I highly recommend this restaurant. I told other Legalshield Associates about my experience and they mentioned how much they enjoyed their lunch or dinner here as well.   Opentable made scheduling a reservation so easy.   Thanks for the wonderful meal!! See ya during CES 2016.",

The restaurant was not busy but the time between requests extras was what really drove the overall experience down. I almost wanted to go to the bar to get a drink refill twice. Just get the sense of being disorganized.  28 minutes later we are still waiting on our bill. That waiter just keeps walking by and nothing. He must be looking for that ketchup for my fries. Thank god we got that refill earlier",

VJ Germano greeted us, his warmth and elation to see us set the tone for a beautiful meal. He remembered all of the items we ordered during our last visit, which always amazes me. He makes us feel like family. For an appetizer, we had the Jumbo Crab Cake with Mirliton & Pepper Chow Chow and Lemon Aioli. This time for my main course, I ordered the Lamb served with House Made Sausage, Goat Cheese Pickled Pepper Potato Cake, Raw Vegetable Gremolata, Romesco, and Red Wine Demi. The lamb was cooked perfectly, my compliments to the chef. For dessert; I had the Banana Bread Pudding served with Fosters Sauce, Caramelized Bananas, and Vanilla Cream. Oh my goodness, it was delicious. The food, the ambiance, and the service were immaculate. We had the best time that night. My heartfelt thank you to VJ and the staff of Emeril's Fish House for everything. We hope to see you all again soon.",

Jumbo lump blue crab cake was great- little filler, great taste, nicely seasoned. Pecan crusted redfish, served with cheese grits and ratatouille, was uber fresh, tasty, and perfectly done. Hubby had trout, fresh and delicious. Portions were satisfying. The banana cream pie is, without a doubt, the BEST EVER, large enough to share. We ended our dinner with a couple of cappuccinos, an absolutely lovely finish to an outstanding dining experience. I look forward to returning on my next trip to Vegas, and hubby and I were discussing a trip to NOLA to try Emeril's there. Bravo!",

First off, the best appetizer on the list is Emeril's BBQ shrimp. The shrimp were tender and prepared with a smoky sweet BBQ sauce. It was so delicious I would recommend this as a must try app. My next favorite app was the blue crab with remoulade. There were large chunks of cold crab meat on a lettuce bed, served with a delicious sauce. The mushroom risotto was not so great. The rice was a bit hard, could have used a few more minutes of cooking.  Next up main courses-  you cannot go wrong with the lobster tail with beurre blanc! The lobster was fresh and tender.  My favorite part of this dish was the mashed potatoes. There were sauteed sweet onions mixed in which took them to another level. Another delicious choice was the crab stuffed shrimp. The shrimp were marinated in a Cajun seasoning, served on a bed of succotash. They were not skimpy on the seasoned crabmeat stuffed inside. This is an all-around great place to have an excellent fine dining dinner!",

    "text": "I really like Emeril's food.  I always have.  In my memory, at least, Emeril's New Orleans restaurants are a shade better than his Las Vegas restaurants.  Maybe just being in New Orleans kicks it up a notch, or maybe my memory is just failing me, but even without the Crescent City authenticity we are still in five star territory here.  Food - Emeril's gumbo is the best I've ever had.  My wife asked me, \"can you make this at home?\"  I started to explain that the first step is a dark roux, which takes something like an hour of stirring on the stove, and that put an end to that inquiry.  So gumbo remains an eat-out dish, and this is the place to eat it.  For my entree I had flat iron steak with a side of jambalaya.  The jambalaya was very good.  The steak was tasty meat and well seasoned, but cooked to medium rather than the medium rare I had ordered.  I'm always a little bit amazed at how often high end restaurants make that mistake.  Medium rare is 125 degrees, for crying out loud.  If the cook can't tell, then use a friggin thermometer.  But I didn't send it back, and I would still call the meal five stars.  My wife thought her wedge salad, and BBQ shrimp with a side of mashed potatoes were very good.  For dessert we split a slice of banana cream pie, which was truly delicious and more than enough for two.  Oh, yeah, and the cornbread was really excellent.  Service - top notch.  They use a \"team\" concept, in which we had two main servers who worked together.  I'm surprised that more restaurants don't do that, since it allows the wait staff to work more quickly and really stay on top of things.  Ambiance - a really large, open room which was nicely appointed, but which still had a bit of a cafeteria feel to it.  In other words, not great for romance.  Location - The trek from the self-park garage to the restaurant is, if nothing else, good for working up an apetite, or maybe training for the Las Vegas Marathon.  It did reinforce our preference for off-Strip restaurants.  Might not Emeril consider putting a restaurant in the Orleans Hotel & Casino?  It would just make sense, wouldn't it?  And maybe it would even bring that extra \"kick it up a notch\" that I mentioned about Emeril's New Orleans restaurants.  Price - I strongly disagree with the reviews here that call this restaurant expensive.  For a high end restaurant in a Strip hotel, it is a downright deal.  Drinks were a little bit stingy, but at a fair price (two cocktails and two glasses of wine came to about what we were charged for a single round of drinks at the MGM casino bar).  And the whole meal described above came in at well under $200.  So, all in all, and despite the overcooked steak, I still consider Emeril's name on a restaurant to be a seal of excellence.  It's a shame that Table 10 closed.  Maybe next time we'll try Delmonico's.",

Mind u I'm excited for the food bcuz of who he is and it was our first time there... when the food came.. the crab cake had too much breading for the price... my daughter's jambalaya were salty to the point where she had to them to take it (they didn't bother to ask if she wanted anything else) and my plate of fish look beautiful but it was soooo bland I had to asked for hot sauce.. there was barely any sauce if any... then I asked them to bring a cake for my daughter bcuz it's her bday... when the brought it out it wasn't a cake and it didn't even have hbd writing on the  whatever is was (it wasn't cake). When she took a bite she wasn't impress... I  took a bite and I was like what is this?!!! It looked fudgy but tasted shitty!!!!!... Nvr again will I go back there!!!! I'm sure there are other dishes that might be good but when u go to a restaurant with the name like Emeril's it should be all dishes not cross ur fingers and hope the dish u ordered is amazing!!!!!",

They forgot my cocktail when we all ordered our first round and the lobster bisque they served me was room temperature. They apologized and got me a new one, and the bisque was very delicious btw when at the proper temp. Most of the food came out right. Frogs legs, trout, red fish, jumbalaya, and rib eye steak were all pretty well executed and seasoned well. I know it's Vegas and this place is kinda touristy (the name gives it a lot of cache) but I was just expecting more thump, or \"BAM\" as Emeril would say.",

    "text": "My history with Emeril's Fish House dates well over 12 years. Over that period of time, the restaurant space has remained relatively the same, but it has transitioned to a more casual environment and the tasting menu has become more affordable with less courses. The four course tasting menu for $48 with wine pairing for $30 is a great value with multiple choices for each course featuring some staples and some special chef's selections. My wife and I shared two tasting menus and were pleased with every single course except one. Our server and team got crushed throughout our Friday night dinner and the customary attentive and detailed-oriented Emeril service was lacking.  Everyone in your party is not obligated to order the tasting menu if one the party chooses and there are three choices for each course which provided enough selection for my wife to order the tasting menu also. I do wish there were more fish choices for the third course. It is a fish house isn't it? The deviled potatoes with the salmon egg mousse and caviar was a nice, light start to begin the meal. The BBQ shrimp is always a winner but I was impressed with the squid ink fettuccini which had both tart and spicy notes for course two.   After an extended wait, like a half-hour intermission, the third and fourth courses came out. The rainbow trout took the third course by a landslide as my requested medium pork chop was well done, borderline burnt. I don't know how the cook or the expediter let this dish get out the door. Luckily, the peppercorn rum reduction offered some moisture and hid some of the burnt char. The banana cream pie has definitely grown on me over my last two visits to Emeril restaurants. Our slice was served colder than usual from what I can recall giving it a firmer texture which took away the mushiness that makes me usually shy away from any cream pie.  Our server was great when she first greeted us offering us suggestions, answering questions, and helping us time the courses when we wanted to add raw oysters line up. After she checked on us after course two, we did not see her again until she dropped off our check and we only saw other team members when they dropped off food, topped my wife's water off, or to clear plates. I understand she was busy with two other double digit parties along with three to four other tables, but our service suffered. I wanted to send the pork chop back for a re-fire or replacement, but got tired of waiting and just ate what I could. The third courses were also sitting table-side getting cold while the runners waited for the wine pairing for the entree. It also didn't please me that there was no description of any of the wines, just \"here is a champagne\"  or \"here is your port.\" A short description of the wine flavor profile and rationale for pairing takes literally ten seconds and would have been much appreciated.  With the addition of a half dozen oysters and one drink, the total for our meal was $172 before tip. I do believe this experience was an anomaly and my rating takes into account my previous three visits. But the service issues could have been avoided with better timing of seating and better staffing not causing service to be spread so thin. Undoubtedly, I'll be back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.",

    "text": "I ate here last weekend and was very surprised at the food.  First, let me say that the service was outstanding.  The servers were extremely attentive and checked on us often.  The restaurant space was very nice and spacious where you don't feel like you are on top of other tables.  Now, the food....  Let me say that I ate at Emeril's restaurants in New Orleans (ok, all of them) and his Delmonico restaurant in the Venetian.  I love his gumbo.  When I ordered the gumbo here, I was so surprised at how lacking in flavor it was and it was extremely spicy.  I can handle spice but this sausage was extremely spicy and the only flavor that I tasted in the gumbo was the spicy sausage.  The shrimp did not taste right to me either and basically fell apart in my mouth so I stopped eating them after the first one.  The only saving grace for me was the BBQ shrimp appetizer.  Those shrimp were amazing and the sauce was so good I mopped it up with my corn bread.  I have had the BBQ shrimp at Emeril's other restaurants and it tasted the same so not sure what happened with the gumbo.  I will not come back to this place.",

    "text": "One of the restaurants I was most excited to visit on this trip to Vegas was Emeril's Fish House, as I remembered enjoying it when I was younger and Emeril is generally pretty reliable.  I guess the restaurant is coasting at this point because the experience was pretty disappointing.  I decided to order the Crystal Fried Shrimp Po-Boy (\"Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato and Creole Mayo on Toasted Po-Boy Bread\"). There was definitely potential here but the execution was about as lazy as I can recall from a major restaurant.  The tomatoes were too thick and kind of mealy, the bread was far too dense and unyielding, the shrimp, though well cooked, were sparse and kept falling out of the sandwich, and the Creole mayo was far too sparingly applied to make any impact.  The fries were good, at least. (But the corn bread that was served before the meal was dry and hard.)  It didn't help, either, that the table next to us had some issue with the menu so our waiter essentially ignored us once the food arrived. (I'd wanted to look at a dessert menu but gave up after 15 minutes.)",

    "text": "Located in the walkway between the MGM Signature Hotel and just before you get to the MGM Casino.   I was disappointed in the food here but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it was because we ordered off of the happy hour menu. We ordered one of the platters to share and to me it was essentially 4 oysters, 6 shrimp cocktail and 2 cold yellowfin tacos not worth the $21 we spent on it. The oysters and shrimp were standard but the yellowfin taco strange as inside it was like some sort of yellowfin tuna fish salad, not a fresh fish as I would have expected from a fish taco. The shell seemed like a fried wonton. I would not get this again.   My Mojito was very good although they called it a \"citrus Mojito\" and it tasted like a regular Mojito. I guess all mojitos are citrus because of the lime so perhaps that is my mistake.   Our bartender wasn't overly friendly and he failed to tell us the MLife player's club card doesn't work here. He only told us after we gave it to him with our bill and then asked him to use it on my brother's bill too. Just thought he could have taken 10 seconds to tell us rather than taking it and letting us think we got points for the meal. Lazy.   This place will work if you're hungry and nothing else is open but I think you can do better.",

Everything on the menu is something I *could* make at home but I would never make the appetizer, drinks, main course and dessert all in one evening. It's comfort seafood kicked up a notch (BAM!).   My last meal there was at the bar and staff is very friendly and attentive. They made good wine/dish parings for me and were even kind enough to throw in a little something extra with dessert.   I had the broiled oysters as a starter - delicious and simple. The Four Roaes whiskey infused with coffee and orange peel is a good choice if you like the flavor of orange chocolate- it's very similar. The main dish I had what apparently is the most popular dish, the Scottish Salmon and paired perfectly with the Pinot Noir that was suggested. Perfectly done. Again it's a simple dish any foodie could make at home but it's nice to have someone else do it for you. The banana bread pudding is a must for dessert- it's worth the wait! Paired with a sweet Muscato well. Ended the meal with a double espresso.",

The front is very open to the shopping/food court area of the hotel which made it too loud and less intimate for fine dining. The decor was just plain ugly, with random wall pieces, prints of onyx (which looks like either bread or intestines, depending on your perspective) and streamers?  The food was even worse. I had the mixed grill, which was scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The scallops were cooked well, but the shrimp were definitely not. They were severely overcooked. Nothing on the plate had any seasoning at all, nor sauce, butter or garnish..nothing..just a plate of a few dry shrimp, bland scallops and plain, boiled crab claws. The presentation was so bad that I couldn't believe the place bears Emeril's name. I would love to see him judge the plate I was served on Top Chef!!  Tied for worst thing about this place was the house wine. While they have an impressive wine list, there is relatively little by the glass. We each had a glass of the house white. Oh my.. It is soooo bad. Rarely do we find a wine we can't drink a glass of..this is on the list. Maybe this is the punishment for not buying a nice bottle...blech..  Save your money, plenty of good places to eat in Las Vegas. This isn't one of them.",

    "text": "Oh Emeril what have you done? My husband and I stopped by for dinner to celebrate restaurant week, this being one of the few menus that actually looked appealing. We have been to NOLA in New Orleans and absolutely fell in love with it so we had high hopes. Initially we were pretty impressed, but by the end of the meal it was a disaster. Here is the low-down:  I started with the spinach, nectarine, and blackberry salad with maple buttermilk dressing. This was a sophisticated take on a Southern summer salad. It was delicious and well balanced; I really enjoyed it! My husband had the heirloom tomato, jalapeno cornbread, and avocado salad. It was also pretty good, but the cornbread croutons were oversized and completely overtook everything else in the salad.   Next, I had the clam chowder which was so creamy and perfectly balanced. The potatoes were just a touch undercooked, I am not sure if this was intentional or not, but it was a nice touch that added a little bite to the dish. My husband had the gumbo. The gumbo was at first bite underwhelming, but the more you ate the better it got. There was a nice touch of heat that continued to build with each bite.  Everything up to this point was good, but the moment our entrees hit the table I was concerned. I chose the pecan crusted trout, which is served with the head on and with a giant bed of slaw on top of it. It is not a visually appealing dish in the least, in fact I didn't even want to eat it. The moment I took a bite I immediately regretted it as it was so aggressively salted that I almost spit it out. It was borderline inedible and the slaw on top had absolutely no flavor and added nothing to the dish. It was one of the weirdest things I have ever been served. My husband had the scallops and baby back ribs, what a weird combination in the first place! I am not a fan of scallops so I won't even go there, but the baby back ribs had a bit of a sweetness to them and weren't too bad. I ate some of those and pushed my fish to the middle of the table. The waiter took the queue and asked if he could bring me something else, I turned him down because at this point I was getting full anyway and we still had dessert!  I had to try the banana cream pie for dessert and was expecting a fluffy, creamy cloud. Dessert was probably my favorite course in New Orleans, so I again had high hopes. Unfortunately, there was nothing creamy about the banana cream pie. It was so thick and almost entirely made of slices of bananas that it was more like a bad version of banana cheesecake. I took 2 bites and wanted to throw my hands up in the air and scream, come on Emeril I know you can do better than that!   Overall, we were pretty disappointed. The service was fantastic, but the trout was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever been served and dessert was such a let down. I know that Emeril can make amazing food, I've had the pleasure of eating it, so what is going on here?",

    "text": "Myself, my mother, my sister, and my friend dined at Emeril's during Restaurant Week 2012. The delicious meals served here were amazing and presented very well. The service was fabulous and the waiters were well spoken, as well as generous (more on that later).  The four course RW meal had many choices. To begin with though we were brought a superb bottle of Riesling. I'm so sorry I missed what the name of it was! After our wine we were brought a bread plate that was full of tasty breads - most importantly, the pretzel bread! It was soft, warm, and had that salty pretzel taste.  For my meal I started off with the jalapeno cornbread heirloom tomato salad. It was incredibly filling. I would not suggest this for a starter when you are going to have more to eat! Although it was delicious, I was wishing for a bit more jalapeno kick.  Next I had the Fall River Clam Chowder. All of our soups were poured simultaneously from the pots they were cooked in, into our bowls. I think the presentation adds a fun moment to the dining experience. As for the chowder, it was okay, but nothing amazing. I've had better chowder from a street vendor in San Francisco.  For the main course I opted for the Hoison glazed sea scallops and baby back ribs. I was slightly disappointed. When the first part of the meal says \"Sea Scallops\" I expected more of those and less of baby back ribs. But it was completely opposite. On the good side, the scallops were so good. Not chewy. They just melted in your mouth and they were BIG. I wish I had had more. I really only had a few bites of the ribs. I didn't think they were that great.  Lastly I had the banana cream pie. It is an absolute must. It was delightful. Somewhat fluffy, yet decadent at the same time.   We finished off two complimentary bottles of wine during the course of dining. Hmm, yes, well it helps to know people in the business. ;)  Overall I can't give Emeril's 5 stars, but I am certainly a fan. I would love to return for more seafood on another visit.",

    "text": "We had a great meal with fantastic service! Doug and Robert are conscientious and personable servers that time their appearance just when you need them! The manager came by twice to make sure all was well and indulge in some nice social chit-chat.   First we ordered 2 cocktails- I had the bourbon smash (Black Beard?) and my fiancee ordered another new drink served in a martini glass. A good start....  Now, onto the food- a new (so I was told) appetizer was a bite on a French bread slice that had goat cheese, a green sauce (sorry, I forgot what it was), and some delish salami slices on top- very tasteful! Next, had some savory large chunk lobster bisque with a delightful twist of sliced fresh tomatoes and crispy green beans- if this combination sounds strange to you- all I can say is that you need to try it- it works! However, I like my soup hot, so let me suggest that you request it that way as my only criticism is that it was warm.  The lettuce wedge was refreshing and what I had expected. The main courses were the halibut (fresh) and bar-b-qued salmon. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the halibut seared and chose the garlic ponzu sauce- which I highly recommend. My fiancee had the salmon and it came with a hash-type side dish- everything on his plate was eaten, enjoyed, with a statement of repeating the order next time come here.   Last, but not least, the dessert! Cappacino lovers- make sure to order it to accompany your dessert, you won't regret it! The rolled chocolate cake has a raspberry filling in the center, the banana cream pie is full of fresh bananas, and the ice cream/sorbet literally melts in your mouth! A perfect way to end a perfect dinner!!!",

Started with the burrata salad with tomatoes and fava beans.  The burrata was fresh but the tomatoes were not ripe.  After speaking with fellow patrons at the bar ( beware of jambalaya), I tried the BBQ shrimp.  Wow that was a lot of salt...  The staff proactively offered to remove the shrimp fro my bill. That was nice and unexpected.  Still- DRINKS ONLY if you find yourself at this establishment in the MGM.",

    "text": "BEWARE - Don't ever go here after 2p, between the lunch and dinner service.  They have a limited menu at the bar and service at the bar.  We were running late for lunch and decided to sit at the bar and get something to eat.... Big Mistake....  When we sat we were the 3rd party to sit at the bar.  We waited at least 7 minutes to even get acknowledged and be given menus.  I knew we were off to a bad start, but we hung in there for more abuse.    More guests started sitting and the next thing you knew - the bar was pretty full with over 25 guests sitting at the bar all waiting to be serviced.  The really retarded part of this deal was there was only ONE bartender trying to service the 25 people.... H E L L O....  There were 4 servers standing on the side talking, a host and a manager taking at the podium and another manager in a suit talking to the servers.  What kind of team work is this???  The poor bartender was doing his best, but the guy was clearly overwhelmed.    When the food runners bring the food out, they just drop it at the bar and don't help out by placing it in front of the guest.  The food sits at the bar as the bartender is busy and can't get to the food to deliver it to the guests.  So retarded and ridiculous.  This is really poor service.  The managers are really good for nothing - why are they not helping out to insure their guests get good service???The managers still did not help out when the bar was full of people - No one helped out.  Unbelievable.  It was stressful watching the bartender - i wanted to get up and help the poor guy.    We ordered a chowder and a gumbo.  To our surprise the bartender whips it up himself and serves the soup from inside the bar.  Strange....There is 2 soup terrines in the bar - one for chowder and the other is gumbo.  Of course, the soup is not poured nicely - there are spills on the side of the dish and he whipped the bowls in front of us.  I would think the Chef would at least like to service the soup.  Not nice at all.  Soup was okay, but the gumbo at Table 10 at the Palazzo was much better.  I think all the cooks, except for one, stays after 2p, as the rest of the food was bad.  Definitely not what you would expect from Emeril.  Sad in fact...  The ceviche was poorly seasoned and tasted awful.    The sausage sliders were okay and the frog legs were mediocre.  Overall a really bad experience.  I will never go to this location again.  Too many other places to spend my money.",

The various fishes were cooked well and the jambalaya style dish was well executed.  They also brought out a cream cheese wanton for my birthday and as desert a strawberry sorbet. Everything was tasty.  What I didn't like was the ambients of the restaurant.  It wasn't intimate enough for both our tastes.  The service and food was more than excellent just wish the set up was a little different.  Good choice if you're looking for seafood.",

    "text": "Emeril's style of cheffery is considered by many young chefs these days to be lazy and outdated. Though he probably was, at some point, an inspiration to most of them (they'll never admit it), his generation's approach to food and cooking seems to be a dying artform.  But there's something refreshing to his laissez faire, rustic kind of cooking. It's less scientific and more \"feel\". Less sous vide and more pan roasted. This is what I was looking for when I dined here.  Unfortunately, the experience mostly seemed hackneyed and lazy.   The server was...well...weird. I couldn't quite read him. Maybe he was new. Either way, he did a satisfactory job and was at least friendly.   We started with the chilled seafood platter. I was excited because the menu said the shrimp and lobster was \"creole boiled\" and that there was king crab remoulade. And though, the shrimp and lobster were fresh and delicious, the were certainly no creole spices to be found anywhere. Not to sound like an elitist, but I lived in Louisiana for 8 years and have eaten lots of creole boiled whatnot and there was no spice at all in this seafood...and barely any flavor. (Ok, I guess I'm an elitist...sue me!)  Second course we received the gumbo and the barbequed shrimp. The former was rich and smokey, full of flavor and decidedly lukewarm. The other complaint about the gumbo is the homemade andouille: super garlicky...overwhelmingly so and whatever spices were in there weren't ground up enough because I was crunching on some stuff every other bite. The shrimp were superb. This is a classic Emeril dish that always delivers. I will say I would prefer a crustier, sturdier type of bread to serve with the dish. The rosemary biscuits, while fantastic, crumble when trying to dip into that beautifully rich and flavorful sauce.  For the main course, we split the grilled salmon with barbeque sauce, frizzled onions and brabant potato hash with tomatoes and andouille. Fresh fish, perfectly cooked to medium, yet a bit overwhelming. Lots of flavor doesn't always translate to balanced flavor. There was a lot going on in this dish and again, the homemade andouille just kind of overpowered my palate (not to mention my GI tract. I think I burped garlic for about a week).  The dessert was decent. We ordered the trio with bread pudding, banana cream pie and chocolatey something-or-other. The chocolatey-something-or-other was (obviously) not memorable. The banana cream pie was UBER rich but tasted good. The bread pudding was definitely the best part.   More is not always better. There was definitely a little too much BAM! and not enough thought put into these dishes. This seemed more like the cuisine of an upscale Claim Jumper than of a world class chef.",

I brought it to the attention of \"a manager\" and he automatically came back with another salad, assuming I wanted another one. I graciously declined and asked for a bottle of champagne for my \"mishap.\" To my disappointment again, I was told he couldn't extend that to me. Oh really? So you can remove the salad from the check but can't compensate me for eating plastic? Hmmmm. I wonder how the health board would feel about this unfortunate error. With a party of 12, the most you can do for me and this error is a free salad? What if I had choked on it? And had to be given the HM and taken to the hospital? It's not about getting something for free, it's about Customer Service and righting a very serious wrong. I'm really insulted. And now all the Restaraunt staff is walking by looking at us like we did something wrong. I think I've totally lost my appetite!",

    "text": "Living full-time at the MGM Signature, I had high hopes that I could make Emeril's one of my regular dinner spots. Wow. Not gonna happen.  The food is excellent -- yet not even the best food in the world can compensate for service that I can only describe as wretched. I've been here five times. Two times (including tonight) I've had to walk out without ordering anything at all after being ignored by the servers at the counter.   Here's the deal. The people who work at the counter/bar absolutely despise their jobs. I've never seen such resentment and contempt toward customers in my life. Plenty of restaurants have bad service. Nothing earth-shattering about that. But believe me, no restaurant employee in my forty years of dining has come close to matching the level of visible disgust that oozes from the Emeril's counter staff. You can see it in their eyes. You can feel it when they speak to you. They don't want to be there, they don't want YOU to be there, and they'll do whatever it takes to avoid serving you. The only thing they do with any degree of consistency is speak to each other in Spanish about how much they hate working there.  I want to make one thing clear. This review only applies to the counter/bar staff. Perhaps the wait staff in the main dining areas aren't so full of bile and resentment, and if so, that's great.  If I could give the management one piece of advice it would be this: Fire the counter staff immediately. All of them. Replace them with trained personnel that know how to interact with customers without copping such a horrible attitude. Keeping these bad apples around is going to create a toxic environment for both your employees and customers.  ***  UPDATE [7/25/12]: I waited three months and then returned to see if Emeril's had gotten their act together. They hadn't. The management hasn't made a single change. The counter/bar staff are still as inattentive and bitter as ever. This is without a doubt the worst dining establishment I've ever encountered.  Avoid this place like the plague. If for some reason you truly feel compelled to dine here, your best bet is to avoid the counter/bar area, sit at a table, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Good luck.",

I was glad I was able to order the scallops and clam dish without mushrooms, and the gnocchi was perfect.  I don't necessarily strive to find fish dishes that incorporate cheese (this one had some parmesan), but I wasn't reluctant there.  My wife ordered the broiled oysters and said they were unbelievable - seasoned well and tender.    Only gripe was the half hour \"happy hour\" from 9:30pm to 10:00pm - not sure why a happy hour doesn't last a full hour.  This came into play when we got held up with a problem with our room at MGM and tried to eat dinner one night much later than we had thought - apparently all the MGM restaurants shut down at 10pm, but looking at the sign we thought we might have a chance since there was a happy hour from \"930 to close\".  The hostess stared at us blankly when we expressed our confusion.  Shame on us for not knowing the hours, but still a head scratcher.  But obviously this is an excellent place and worth a visit if you're looking for some quality seafood in MGM.",

When we ask for refills they brought a new bottle to the table. We all enjoyed our dinner and would revisit the place again. More attention to the customers would be appreciated next time.",

    "text": "Been coming here for years and glad this place is still here.  This was Emeril's first restaurant in Vegas before Delmonico steakhouse and Table 10 (both very good as well).    This restaurant has a selection of not only cajun inspired seafood dishes like po boys and etouffe, they also offer more diversity with dishes like asian inspired ribs and salads.  On this visit, we were feeling quite ambitious.  We started off with the cerviche- there was a mix a fish and shrimp, marinated in a tomato sauce and topped with avocado and chiles.  This was served with tortilla chips.  This was a pretty mellowed down cerviche as it wasn't overwhelmingly citrus-y.  We also got a few raw oysters that were served with cocktail sauce and the traditional mignonette sauce.  Can't go wrong with these as they were very fresh.  For entrees, the bf got the rock shrimp po boy.  It was pretty good although I have to say the breading was a little thick.  The cajun fries that came with it were wonderfully flavorful.  I had a house salad and the gumbo.  The salad was simple- dressed with lemon and olive oil which was very refreshing.  The gumbo was as good as ever- served over rice and even more amazing with some hot sauce.  For dessert, you can't skip the banana cream pie.  This has always been my favorite dessert and I'm not even that big of a fan of sweets.  I had tried to get this at Table 10 last time but was sad they didn't make the banana cream pie.  Anyways, this slice of pie is $8...but I think it's worth it.  It's decadent and ridiculously rich...but you only live once.  The pie has a great graham cracker crust and a wonderful vanilla custard surrounding fresh slices of banana.  It's topped with thick whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce and a few chocolate curls for garnish.  My favorite thing at Emeril's for sure!!!  This place would normally get 5 stars from me but the service was lacking.  I originally had reservations here but the bar looked empty and we were early.  However, after ordering, the bar filled up and our service was pretty much non existent.  We had to flag someone down to get our food after someone from the kitchen delivered it to the counter for the bartenders.  It wasn't the bartenders' fault that it was so busy but overall the place felt understaffed.  I recommend getting a reservation for this place as table service would probably be a lot better.  Lastly, this place is pricey but for the quality and flavor of the food I think it's worth it.",

We began with Louisiana Style Shrimp Etouffee green onion rice, andouille pork sausage, clam chowder soup and blue shrimp something.  None of them were anything to write home about. The gumbo didn't have much of a real gumbo taste.  I would give them all a soft 3 stars. For entrees, we ordered the seafood stew and the special halibut, angel hair pasta with crab meat a side order of hickory smoked bacon Mac and cheese dish. Both entrees were just ok, again a soft 3.  The halibut was very dry and just doesn't qualify as a dish that Mr. Legassie would enjoy himself. The stew was pretty bland too with only one shrimp in it. The taste just wasn't there. The Mac and cheese deserves four.   All in all, this place is disappointing. I was expecting more from good ole Emiril.   Service was excellent ! See pics",

I asked the waiters the best way to eat the oysters and their recommendations were good. I liked the oysters with cocktail sauce lemon and a little horseradish.  Filled me up real good. They give free bread and ice water upon request. Will most likely be back.   Spent roughly $25 and left pretty full. Good deal for a quick bite. Only thing i didn't like was the waiters kept pushing me to get more oysters.. And dagnab it their pushing worked. Go figure.  I recommend you check this place out.",

The service was good - not great - and definitely not what you get in New Orleans.  But it was better than most other restaurants, and our server was friendly and relatively attentive.  I had the Louisiana  broiled oysters, followed by the pork chop with the remoulade sauce and a side of sweet potatoes.  My only \"complaint\" is that the portions were huge.   The chop was close to perfect, and the sweet potatoes were not bad either.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back, but I still prefer THE Emeril's.",

My wife ordered the salmon salad and redfish hush puppies.  The salad was wonderful, and the salmon was cooked just right, moist and tender.  The hush puppies, on the other hand, was way too spicy hot.  My wife took a few bites, but could not finish.  For a restaurant that charges a premium for its entrees, the food should be spot on.  Overall, a disappointing dinner for what we paid.",

    "text": "A half empty restaurant on Friday night of Labor Day weekend should have tipped us off that this might not be a great experience. We have really enjoyed a few different Emeril restaurants in the past so we expected solid food.  I was surprised after seeing their social media promotion of bourbon month that there were no featured cocktails or menu specials, other than the fresh sheet. But we ordered cocktails and a BBQ shrimp appetizer. I had to ask twice for the Pellegrino I had ordered instead of the tap water that was dropped at the table. Our cocktails took an incredibly long time. Did I mention the restaurant was half empty? Once they arrived they were really, really good. Bourbon smash and a peach tea - excellent drinks. Our shrimp came and we enjoyed it. The shrimp were smaller than I expected but tasty, and we really enjoyed the sauce.  Our salad course arrived timely. The Caesar was described as having a Parmesan crisp, which was actually a thin slice of bread that was Parmesan crusted. It was incredibly hard and very difficult to break apart and enjoy in the salad.  Our entrees arrived, again at a timely pace so that was good. My husband's shrimp boil was a massive plate of food. It was nicely flavored and was truly an overwhelming platter of shrimp. I did a fresh fish selection and it was perfectly fine, not awe-inspiring but it was alright. Once we were served our entrees neither of our two servers came back again. We had empty cocktails, and probably each would have enjoyed another has we been given the opportunity to order.  We finished eating, which when you are peeling shrimp actually takes quite awhile, and sat. And sat. And sat. There was a table of 8-10 in our section, and I would definitely cut some slack for that. However there were two people waiting on our table and one of them was virtually always just standing at the server station. One thing about Vegas is usually you get awesome service, and this was shockingly poor. I would have enjoyed being offered dessert, but after we sat and stared at our finished plates and empty glasses for so long we just needed to be done there.  Having really enjoyed restaurants in this group in the past it's tough to just write this one off. But between lackluster food and poor service it would be tough to give this one another shot.",

The food tasted as ordinary as something I can eat at the Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. And I don't know why I even bothered dressing up. Their patrons show up in swimsuits and flip-flops. Gross! I have higher expectations for an establishment that serves $40/plate dishes.",

The silverware was replaced between every course and overall refills of water and clearing of the table was prompt.    The cornbread in a skillet was decent but not amazing, the mac n cheese was better then average.    seared yellowfin tuna with yuzu sauce and caviar - standard sushi with yuzu sauce, although caviar gave it a nice pop/textrure  seared main sea scallop with rock shrimp pilaf in ginger broth - probably my favorite course, the sweet ginger broth was really interesting  pan seared snapper + mussels - the snapper and mussels were good but the pasta and pine nuts under them were only so so  pan roasted atlantic salmon - the salmon was decent the vegetables under it were not  petite cut filet mignon with blue cheese and red wine reduction - tastes exactly how you would imagine it would taste based on the description, 'nuff said  new orleans bread and butter pudding - better then average",

Good bread, tasty oysters and delicious gumbo got us started.  My wife had a fabulous trout special and it was both huge and delicious.  I had the shrimp etouffee and I was blown away.

The staff was nice and polite, my drinks were excellent. Myself and my friends husband both got the \"Maine\" lobster carbonara. It was awesome! Real Maine lobster, ( not the weird kind of lobster they have on the West coast). Big chuncks and list if it, they did not skimp. Lots of bacon and snap peas and just the right ammount of sauce. Not dry or soup, perfect! I don't remember what my friend got but she loved it. We were so full from dinner, we just got coffee and skipped desert.  I would definately reccomend it and will go back again. The only negative is that it is kind of pricy, but its Vegas and everything there is expensive.",

The oysters didn't seem fresh yes I know it's not New England but I've dined here before and they were excellent.  Then I ordered Alaskan King Crab Legs my favorite yes I know they're frozen regardless wherever you get them in the 48 continental states but again they seemed old as well.  The only good and edible item was the crab cake.  The server was super nice and really it's not his fault, I think the food has just gone downhill.

I do cook a lot out of his cookbooks and his recipes are always abundant in flavor and spices.  He is also known for his flavorful meals, but this is not what I encountered here.   Cornbread was amazing!  Tuna poke was fresh with taro chips. The chips were the only thing in the meal with any flavor; Tuna was to have spicy soy and ginger, but the amounts were so small I only tasted the flavor once.  Seared tuna was good. We ordered it medium-rare, it appeared medium to me. Although, the flavor was good and I would order it again.  Pan-fried Rainbow Trout was what I had. Again, I thought this meal was lacking flavor. The fish was cook well with the skins on it, but the beurre blanc sauce was alright, although very little of it.  Service was good, until they rushed the meal. We had not even finished our poke and our meals came out so fast that I thought they might have been pre-cooked in the back. Poor timing for a fine-dining restaurant.    Maybe, I am being over-critical, but I came here expecting to be blown away. Obviously, I was not. For the price, I would go somewhere else or better yet save the cash and get a double-double at In-And-Out.",

They did get our wines/food confused (who ordered what) a couple of times but it was an honest mistake and they were super apologetic and brought us out an extra dessert for the mishap. We did not feel rushed and very much enjoyed the whole experience. We had lived in NOLA for a year and had never tried an Emeril restaurant so I was happy that this experience did not disappoint!

    "text": "Just walked out of here and writing this while the memory is fresh. I've had the privilege of eating in 2 of Emeril's restaurants in NOLA and have never had a bad meal. Not even a mediocre meal. I was wondering how tonight would be since it is Vegas and the namesake chef I'm sure is fairly removed from how this place is run.   I can tell you that it was a fantastic meal. The tome of a wine list has great variety and selections at every price point. The Sazerac was one of the best ever. The servers were friendly and accommodating, and the food was as good as it gets. The tasting menu was a bargain not just for what was on it in terms of ingredients but the portions were full sized for all 4 courses. I love tasting menus because they give you a chance to try a lot of things but every one I have ordered from in my life makes up for the discounted price by making the portions smaller. The portions here tonight were large and created a situation where we could not finish it all. Couple that with a wine flight and it was a memorable meal.   The service was great. Ever present but casual and not over-bearing. When one of the wines tasted a bit off and I asked about it, there was a replacement to something else without hesitation. I've seen some reviews here for slow service but during my visit, they were on their game.   Highlights of the meal were pretty much everything but the stars of the night declared at my table were the Sazerac, the gumbo and the warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Next time, instead of breaking the bank with the hedonistic tasting menu, I'm going to just order those 3 things so my wallet retains its shape and I don't have to feel guilty about not finishing everything.",

    "text": "With all due respect to the guy whose name sits above the restaurant, my coming here had less to do with Emeril and more to do with my hankering for some clam chowder.  Sure, I was a bit curious, having seen his shows when they were still on the Food Network.  However, seemingly like his popularity, it feels like his food (and this place) might be a few years past their prime...  Unlike with my experience at another famous restaurateur's spot just a short walk away, my meal here proved to be rather underwhelming (the fact there were only a few groups here for lunch should've been my first tip).  True to Emeril's roots, the menu features several Cajun classics like gumbo, oysters, and shrimp po'boys.  However, for some reason, their lunch offerings felt a bit narrow.  Either that or maybe their stuff just didn't sound all that appealing...  -- CORNBREAD...FREE (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=obkp07XqvgDSo74G3wXfiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>) It was definitely pretty cool to get cornbread instead of the typical sort of bread options, but I can't say they were anything special.  While it did have a nice flavor to it, the texture felt dry and brittle with every bite.  -- FALL RIVER CLAM CHOWDER...$10 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=d33g1gwyqcn7k40u2PYC6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>) Thankfully, the one thing I came here for didn't disappoint!  The potatoes were tender, the consistency was just right, and it wasn't all that salty (which I was legitimately worried about).  It could've used more clams, but so could every clam chowder in the world.  -- CRYSTAL FRIED SHRIMP PO-BOY Dressed with Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Pickles served with Creole Seasoned French Fries...$16 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=cC38Iqx34IcZVl195SWz6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/emer...</a>) This seemed like a good pick for something light, but it totally missed the mark.  While shrimp were fine (sweet, lightly battered, just enough Crystal hot sauce), the rest of the po' boy was awful (I ate two bites and left the rest).  Sadly, even the fries missed - decent flavor, but not very crisp.  In addition to how underwhelming the food was, I thought the service was pretty unremarkable as well.  A couple of workers were nice, but, again, it was in stark contrast to my experience at Wolfgang Puck's, where the entire staff was super warm and friendly.  Clam chowder or not, Emeril's might have been good enough a decade ago, when options weren't nearly as plentiful.  But now?  Please.",

Pleasantly surprised by the X Factor pinot grigio he recommended after I couldn't choose the right Riesling. Needed a dry high acid wine to perk me up. The wine was great and the service was as fast if not faster than I'd expect on a Saturday night here on summer break Vegas. Gotta come back!",

    "text": "Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is getting a bit long in the tooth both in the environment and with the flavors the kitchen puts out these days.   Emeril's New Orleans Fish House has been a stalwart at the MGM Grand Casino for as long as anyone can remember and offers Chef Emeril Lagasse's love of fresh seafood and signature \"New New Orleans\" style of cooking which is basically Creole and Cajun recipes with upgraded ingredients to justify the $20.00-$30.00 plate costs. The service was superb and although the interior will bring you back to 1999 - they keep the place spotless and the people watching is best in class.   I opted for the Lobster Roll ($24.00) which sports a minuscule amount of Sauteed Maine Lobster, a smear of Tarragon Aioli on a Brioche Bun and Kettle Chips and Slaw as sides. All of the ingredients were high quality and there was thought put behind the dish but the trace amounts of Lobster was frustrating considering this meal was over $30.00 out the door.   Trust me, there was no \"BAM!\" moment to be had.   With Morimoto, CraftSteak, Joel Rubichon, L'Altier, and even Nathan's Hot Dogs all within a short walking distance I cannot justify a return visit to Emeril's New Orleans Fish House and must wonder when Emeril will update his restaurant 's interior and menu to be relevant once again in the Vegas dining scene.",

We had wine from Spain and Argentina. There are good value bottles in the back of the wine guide.   The Malbec from Argentina was especially delicious.    We also had the seafood tower, it was a lot of seafood for the 5 of us.  We should have just had that and salads but we all opted for full meals.   I had the beer braised short ribs.  I didn't taste any beer flavoring and it was a tad on the dry side.  However it was a huge rib.   Probably double cut.  The mashed root veggies were awesome.  Other meals were tuna steak, scallops and a whole redfish .   Nobody really had an outstanding main.  We were also served corn bread which was very good as well.  Go here hungry and an empty credit card.",

It was like it was the very last bowl they had. It did not have a single piece of andouille in it. The seafood was unidentifiable.   The shrimp on the Poboy was losing all its batter. I think they baked it rather than fried. The bread was thick and dense and cold. The few pieces of shrimp kept popping out the side. I gave up and left. Las Vegas has very few places to satisfy the craving for NOLA. Emeril's is off my list.",

    "text": "As Emeril says, \"BAM!\" The flavors here didn't disappoint. However, with the service, although the staff was very friendly, it was quite slow during a non-peak hour.   We went around 3:30pm for a late lunch and just a few tables were occupied. Our waiter greeted us with some complimentary cornbread, which was one of the best I've ever eaten! We needed a couple more minutes to peruse the menu, but it was quite some time before our waiter returned. Then, it took about 30 minutes after we ordered before our food arrived. That might not seem like a terribly long time, but a table that ordered after us received their food first. If we had gone closer to dinner time, we would have been at risk for missing our show.   On the bright side, we enjoyed our entrees!  I ordered the Lobster Roll (labeled as a special), served with a side of creamy crunchy slaw and house-made potato chips. The lobster was fresh and flavorful, enhanced with a tarragon-spiced sauce. It was served inside a lightly toasted and fluffy brioche bun. I loved the sides of slaw and chips, each with their own savory touches. The portion was reasonable for lunch, but not too filling.   **TIP** If there's an entree on both the lunch and dinner menu, you can get it for quite a bit cheaper during lunch. Just keep in mind, the lunch portions are likely smaller. For example, my Lobster Roll on the lunch menu was $24, but over $30 on the dinner menu. I'm sure the dinner version contained more lobster, but I was glad to save a few bucks for what otherwise is the same dish.",

We were immediately seated as a party of two.  Our server was 10207 D-207, whomever that is.  He was great and was assisted by another lady.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Over the course of the meal, I had two cocktails and my GF had water & a Coke.  We ordered the Wedge Salad, an appetizer of BBQ'd shrimp, the NY Prime steak, medium.  We also ordered the Trout.  The salad is huge and two can easily split it.  It was delicious.  The BBQ'd shrimp were fantastic.  Huge shrimp in some sort of brown sauce.  Delicious is the correct word for them.  A must order!!  Next we had the steak which was perfectly cooked and easy to split.  It was very tender and juicy.  But the trout, which I'm leaving for last, was over the top great.  It was perfectly cooked and layered with small green beans and large chunks of fresh crab.  Overall, this meal and the atmosphere were GREAT.  Highly recommended.  Total cost: $132.61, without tip.",

He didn't even like them. He made faces and everything. We actually still laugh on how bad they were.  Waiter ended up ok. But he was obviously sexist. Didn't appreciate that I asked for something that was on the website and not on the menu. He played more attention to hubby and disregarded me.  Not good when I hold the purse strings!

I did have my doubts in the beginning, especially after reading a considerable amount of 1-3 star reviews and the fact that I was able to easily reserve a table for 10 at 7:30p on a Saturday night - I did it on Open Table around 3:30p that same day!  Reason #1 - my uncle called me last minute to tell me that 2 more people were coming so had to adjust our reservation of 10 to 12.  They said no problem.  We still had to wait maybe 15 minutes passed our reservation time since we had to wait for the party before us to finish their dinner, which was not a big problem.  Reason #2 - our server was nice (don't remember his name) and pretty much everything came out in a timely manner.  If anything, our entrees took a little bit longer than our drinks and appetizers.  Reason #3 - from the bread basket to our desserts, food was really good!  The bread basket consisted of pretzel rolls and onion rolls, both were warm and soft and oh-so-yummy.  The gumbo ($14) and clam chowder ($13) were good, the apple & butter lettuce salad ($13 for small) needed more flavor though.  I got the BBQ'd Atlantic salmon ($34), and it was so tasty that even my petite mom who ordered the same thing finished her entire plate.  Hubby's rib eye steak ($49) was big and juicy, and the mac & cheese ($12) was creamy and cheesy.  BTW, there was no kid's menu obviously, so my older one got the clam chowder and side of basil & spinach fettuccine ($9), and little one just got the side mac & cheese and they were fine with that...my little one ended up eating half of my salmon anyways (more mac & cheese for me!).  Although we were all so stuffed, I really wanted to try their bread pudding (I LOOOVE bread pudding) so I ordered that ($11) and my older one got the fruit sorbet ($6).  Holy Creoley (ba-dum-tsss) it was one of the best bread pudding I've ever tasted!  More soaked and moist than what I'm used to (looked kind of like oatmeal), but warm with a hint of whiskey (very very subtle)...ohhh yeahhh.  The fruit sorbet came in three scoops (was expecting just one) and the flavor was mild and smooth.  It's homemade and sure tasted like it :9  The prices here are definitely not proportionate to the amount that you get, but rather proportionate to the taste?  Maybe my group came on a good day or something, but we all certainly left with happy bellies.",

    "text": "Let's see...started off with a recommended wine by V.J. our server...Sierra Batuco 2014 Pinot Noir which was fruity and smooth...actually a very good Chilean wine. V.J. Germano was a very sincere, pleasant and helpful server and went above my expectations of Emeril's. Because of him making my daughter's and I experience so wonderful I would not hesitate to come back. Oh! Now the food! Started off with the marinated beet salad. Though the portion looks small it is a perfect way to start your dinner. The goat cheese was a perfect marriage of the two. Just yumminess! My daughter had the Warm Brie Tart Salad. It was not warm but still enjoyable. For my entree I had the BBQ salmon with anadouille sausage. My first bite was very salty which I am assuming is due to the BBQ sauce (time to re-evaluate the recipe?) But what saved this meal was the salmon itself! Perfectly cooked and so moist and flaky. Could have done without the fried onion rings on top but helped with the BBQ sauce. My daughter had the Poke which she said was delicious! Overall we had a wonderful meal and experience. On a side note I feel it would perhaps put visitors at ease if managers were not in a suit but of something similar to what the servers wear. They look a little uptight in a suit; however all three on duty smiled as did Tyler and truly cared about your experience. Great job the Wednesday night crew!!",

Growing up Emeril was one of my favorite chefs to watch & I ordered the shrimp cocktail and to be quite honest i was not too impressed. I do give the five stars because the service was great and the ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful, But I definitely/mostly likely won't jump at the chance to eat here again if I find myself dining in the MGM sometime in the future. Only because the options compared to other restaurants I feel are very limited.",

We had an early reservation 2:00pm so it was not a mad house of people. My girlfriend is much more lenient in giving restaurants the benefit of the doubt , but not this time. For appetizer we ordered the duck, it was dull looking, cold, biscuit looked and tasted day old. We also ordered one traditional Thanksgiving dinner that was unpleasant to look at, texture and taste was bad, and   cold again.  Turkey had no flavor, stuffing was like mush , and mash potatoes were cold and unflavored. Corn bread was maybe 2 inch by 2 inch , cold and tough.  Lobster roll made me laugh, unappealing to look at, maybe there were 2 tablespoons of lobster filling that did not fill up a bun whatsoever. Flavor could have been better.  Cole slaw had no flavor. This restaurant did not live up to New Orleans great food. I wanted to taste something amazing , I have been to New Orleans 3 times, I have eaten the best food there, this food was a disappointment and over priced. Turkey Dinner base price I believe was $42 , lobster roll $24.  In their defense they did take her turkey dinner back and brought another one out  that was just as bad. We could hardly wait to leave.  This was my 2018 Thanksgiving dinner a la Emeril.",

    "text": "We went there for lunch on our last day in Vegas. It was around 1pm and I would consider that \"lunch hour\" still. We went to the hostess to acquired a table for a party of 4 and we were told that they need a moment to set up the table. I peaked in the restaurant thinking, ok, there is a party leaving so that is where we are going to sit. About almost 10 minutes later, we are still standing there, I was still looking at that table, and it was still not cleaned up!! So I was telling my husband that they are SO slow in cleaning up....and setting up table..I will put it in my yelp review! The hostess must have heard me saying it because she came over and said, just 10 more minutes and your table will be ready. So approximately 10 min later, we were taken to the table that was further into the restaurant next to the bar and not the one that I was staring at...the first thing i think is, why on earth you need 20 min to set up a table that is already there??!!    So the first thing was, we sat down and was given the menu from our guy and told us the water will come shortly. Guess what. The water never came. About 5-10 min later, the guy appear to take our water. One of us told him that we never got our water so he apologized and got some. So we order two chicken po-boy combo with gumbo and clam chowder and the desserts were banana cream pie and bourbon bread pudding.  The gumbo and chowder came pretty fast (that is about 10-15min after ordering). I didn't understand why would any one pour the hot gumbo into a cold plate right in front of us...the gumbo just became lukewarm and it is really a disappointment. So here comes the long long wait for our po-boy. We sat there for almost 45 minutes to a point where we were about to leave...We asked our guy about when the food is coming and he replied it will be soon. We also instructed that we would like the dessert to come at the same time because I really don't want to wait for another 30 min for a piece of dessert. So in between the waiting, I have observed something that is very interesting. So the bus boys bring the food to the kitchen and leave it on one of those \"temporary station\"!!! Then the waiters will then go and look at the food and try to figure out who is getting what! The end result is: everyone looks very confused!!! I really have never seen that...I don't think that would work well if it was a full night at all.  After a while, the lo-boy finally arrived. I knew it was a combo so it would be smaller in size...but it was absolutely tasteless!!!! It was suppose to be some spiced up chicken!!!! There was barely any SALT on it AT all...that is the same on the fries. It was suppose to be \"cajun\" fries...and only the bottom ones have some kind of salt and cajun taste to it!! Totally disappointing!!! So we asked for the dessert to come at the same time right? It did not come!!!! But I did saw two banana pie sitting on that temporary station for the entire duration while we are eating our po-boy!! Finally, as we are finishing, I asked our guy politely about our dessert, then he went and fetch that banana pie that was sitting there and said, \"oh, the kitchen brought two banana pie so you will have to wait for your bread pudding.\" I was a bit pissed by that point because you need 15 min or so to make a bread pudding??!! So finally we finished the po-boy and the bread pudding arrived. That is a part where I was a bit pissed. I understand he has got his both hand full, one with my dish and another dish in the other hand. He put down my pudding and told me....I will come back for the plate...let me say, the plate was big and the table was small. So I was sitting there crammed between the plates and waiting for him to remove it....I saw him walking back and forth at least twice behind me with EMPTY hands....man...COME ON!!! You could not have taken my empty plate and put it on your temporary station??? So my bourbon pudding.....where is the bourbon??!!! Totally again a huge disappointment!!! No taste at all! not even really sweet?!  So in all, we spend over 2 hours here leaving with feelings of unsatisfied in service and food and I will NEVER recommend any ONE to dine here!!!",

I think if someone had just took the time to come by the table and acknowledge the delay, it would have been alright - but to wait that long after order desert and not really have the delay acknowledged was disappointing.  Still - no DOUBT I will be back next time I am in Vegas",

    "text": "i think i've finally learned that putting a chef's name to a restaurant does not equate amazing food.   Emeril's New Orleans Fish House has impeccable service. The first thing our server asked was whether we were on any time constraints. She definitely worked to help us get to Blue Man Group on time.   The food is decent. We basically shared everything so I got to try a bunch of stuff. The food was a mix of hit and miss. My favorite appetizer was the Crab bake. It was savory but had a hint of sweetness. Add this lovely concoction to toasted bread and you've got a winner! My favorite entree was the Sea bass. My least favorite appetizer was the fried oysters. There wasn't anything special about it. My least favorite entree was the swordfish. I'm not sure if it's just the natural texture of swordfish to be dry but the meat was too dry and there was no accompanying sauce to help it out. Definite miss. No time to try the dessert =(   Overall a good experience but it was not as fantastic as I would have imagined. I've got to find the original.",

The hostess was very polite and saw a table for 4 available and she said if you can sit down now we will take you....so we jumped at the chance!  Just excited to be there the food did not disappoint.  I ordered the Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish which was outstanding - very fresh and I could not stop eating the rainbow garlic couscous bed the fish was presented on!  For dessert my group went overboard and we each ordered something different so we could taste the menu.   *Individual Pecan Pie - AMAZING *Chocolate Creme Brulee with Cinnimon Churros - I was jealous that wasn't my dessert! *Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - So delicious *New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - My least favorite, but in defense of the dessert itself I am not a big bread pudding guy and the rest of the group ate it up!  Suffice to say we left that night with our belts undone...and a good night's sleep followed!",

The food was to die for and the service was exceptional!  I just can't say enough.    I had the halibut, it was cooked perfectly and my mouth still waters thinking about it!   We tried a few appitizers and our servers brought us a free appitizer of Ahi Tuna w/some sort of peanut butter sauce and some sort of wasabi somthing - sounds strange but it is soooo good!    Now, besides the food - the service was great!  I think the servers names were Anthony (or Antonio, really wish I could remember) and Rocky.  They did such a great job.  They were very attentive and answered our questions quickly.  My glass was never empty and I loved that we were all served at exactly the same time, like they brought out 3 extra people each placing the plate at the same time (sounds silly, but it made for a fun experience).  All this and it was a crazy busy Saturday night.",

I give the overall restaurant three stars.  Service was great, but I kept wondering who was my waiter/waitress since I saw about 4 different ones giving me food and drinks.  They were all still very nice.  I chose a salmon dish that tasted a little too dry and the worcester sauce was just too much.  I didn't care for the sausages that were mixed in either.  My boyfriend's meal was a huge slab of steak that was really good but too much even for a huge eater like him.  I felt bad leaving 3/4th of meat to be thrown away, but...I'm sure it happens every day.  Price was reasonable and I enjoyed it, but not enough to go back a second time.",

We have yet to have a bad meal there. I personally like the Salmon (but it's ALL good). The salads are always quite tasty as well.  As for dessert, there is only one choice... the banana cream pie. Sometimes we go to Emeril's and order ONLY that becuase its soooo good!!!  The service is always top-notch, even from the moment we walk in the door. Even though we probably only make it to one of Emeril's places once a year, they always seem to recognize us as returning customers.  The wait staff is always attentive.... sometimes too attentive. One time we noticed that the wait staff was very eager to make sure our water glasses were filled and quick to pick up a dropped napkin or replace a utensil. So, we made a little game of seeing how quickly they'd react by dropping a napkin here & emptying a water glass there... the didn't let us down!!!!",

Had a reservation, so table was ready immediately, or should I say tables; they split our party into two tables of 7...There was enough room for 20 people at one of those tables, I spread my arms out fully in both directions and did not touch either neighbor. Hostess did not make any attempt to change the arrangement. Restaurant was dead, I think we were one of only 5 tables at 12:30. One waiter brought us water, 15 min later a diff waiter brought us 1 cocktail menu for 2 tables to share...10 min later 4 people of our group walked out since the service was so slow, so we consolidated to 1 single table. After about 30-45 min our drinks were served and he took our order. The food was pretty awful. We're from Texas and spend plenty of time in NOLA, so we know what the food was supposed to taste like...The only decent dish was the oysters, but that's pretty hard to screw up. How can you make red beans and rice so awful?! The chicken was probably tossed into a pot of boiling water and then drizzled with so-so bbq sauce. For over $400 we expected, at least, decent service and decent food. I never complain and this time I felt like I had to, the manager did nothing. We finally escaped at almost 3 PM. I have no idea why the service was slow, it was absolutely dead in there. I really shrunk this down, but needless to say not 1 single person from our group was happy. It was a huge disappointing way to follow a once in a lifetime occasion. Never ever again. Not even the one in NOLA. Don't waste your time or your money. What a let down, Emeril.",

The service was very good and the place looks great, but it just wasn't what I had expected. Like a lot of these places in Las Vegas they're in a casino, this one is in the MGM Grand.  I wonder how involved Emeril Lagasse really is in this place. I certainly have no information to say that he isn't, but if the food is any indication I would say he's either overrated or he doesn't stop in very often.",

My only urging would be is to actually order the fish as, after all, it is a fish house.

For the multi-tasting menus, they only allow you to do it if your whole party is going to do it which sucked because we were 12 and 4 people from the group wanted to do it weren't allowed. The wines offered in the wine list are quite expensive, not many cheap options. Majority of the wines (per bottle) had a price tag of $150+.  The food had quite a good taste, very well seasoned and very rich in flavor. I had the Rib Eye which had great taste with a side of lobster tail which was quite small, seemed like a big shrimp for the price of $36 for just that.  The tab ended out at $1200 which averages about $100 per person which seems quite expensive when two of us shared meals with other people, we did have two $52 wine bottles but still i think it was quite expensive when there were just 5 appetizers ordered and 10 meals. The wait for the food was quite long as well id say we waited 45 mins for our food to arrive.  Giving it a 3 because food was good, but the price, the wait, and the choices weren't too good.",

We shared the gumbo and the jambalaya (since almost everyone else in the restaurant was eating this). Both were very good, but tasted kind of similar. They also came out almost immediately so maybe there is a large pot in the back. It honestly worked out very well for us since we were on a time crunch. I would recommend getting the gumbo over the jambalaya since it is about half the price and almost the same thing (the gumbo is more of a soup poured over a bed of rice while the jambalaya was like a paella).",

    "text": "In a place like Vegas where there are restaurants on every corner and up-and-coming competition breathing down the last restaurant's neck, just putting your famous name on something doesn't make it good. That brings me to Emeril's.  The design of the restaurant serves to draw you in. It's sleek, chic and modern. I loved that. The bar is large enough that there most likely isn't much waiting for a seat. I really appreciate that.   When I was there it was empty-ish. There were a few people around the bar, but no huge crowds. That is why I was perplexed that the service was slow. The bartenders seem well meaning, but somewhat loopy. I don't know why. Carbon monoxide leak? I was fine. Anyway.   I ordered the oysters off the bar menu. It was that time right between lunch and dinner so I didn't want to stuff myself. They had the oysters at $1.25/pop. Let me tell you something. I may loathe the strip, but I would crawl across glass to get to these oysters. They were JUST the right size. The kind that you bite into and they aren't too big that you want to hurl, but not too small that you don't even realize you have them in your mouth. It was a Goldilocks moment, for sure. JUST RIGHT. The only issue I had was that they mixed so much horseradish in that my nose was on fire. I am a huge fan of spicy and hot, but not in my cocktail sauce, thank you. I swear I think I smoked the oysters with the fire from my nostrils. I asked for more sauce and they brought me out a huge bowl (overkill) and all was right with the world.  I also ordered rock shrimp on a piece of lame lettuce. It sounded so enticing and then I got it. Nope. I'm a fan of shrimp, I'm a fan of creole shrimp, but I am not a fan of this shrimp. It tasted almost frozen then fried. It was really something I'd expect from a mall food court, seriously. And they had it piled on this lettuce that, on the menu, sounded so good. I was so visually let down that I felt like pushing it away and asking for the REAL rock shrimp. No bueno.   So, I love that they carry two kinds of Chimay (blue and red), but I dislike the $13 price tag when everyone else on the strip charges $12, but I do love the oysters! I can imagine I'll try this place again because, hey, oysters.",

I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!  Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!  My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, \"We already have a long happy hour.\" At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that.",

    "text": "Emeril should be ashamed to have his name associated with this disaster of a restaurant.  The service was fine.  The food was a different story.  We ordered the cold apps: shrimp cocktail and market oysters on the half shell. The shrimp cocktail was good. The market oysters were teeny tiny, about the size of a quarter.  We then ordered the hot apps of charbroiled oysters and the crab cake. The charbroiled oysters were lukewarm at best, with absolutely zero seasoning, toppings, etc. Charbroiled or char grilled oystesrs in New Orleans are an amazing, unique flavor, topped with tons of garlic and Parmesan and smokiness from the grill. These were inedible.  The crab cake, supposedly a number one seller was disgusting. The sauce they served with it was so sweet, it distracted from the sub par crab cake. I was going to ask for remoulade (perfect with crab cakes) but decided to ask for a manager instead.  The manager came over, and I expressed my issues. He ended up comping off everything but the drinks and shrimp cocktail. We tipped the waiter 100% of the bill. Why the manager would not comp the entire bill when someone had such a disastrous experience with the food is beyond me.   I travel to New Orleans at least twice a year, and Vegas twice a year as well. This restaurant is no more creole or cajun than an Applebees. I'm just assuming, I have never been to an Applebees.",

He was very informative about the menu and was patient with our request. Here is the not-so-good news. The food lacked flavors. Since this was an \"Emeril's \" restaurant I expected foods like the Gumbo and steaks to have that deep down Creole flavor but it didn't. Great Gumbo starts with a good shrimp broth base to give the roux that down home ,New Orleans flavor but it lacked that. The BBQ shrimp was just Ok. The pecan toasted Texas redfish was a little tastier. We enjoyed the grits and the steaks could have used more Cajun seasoning. Also if you look at the menu on Yelp, you'll be seriously disappointed because it's outdated and some of those great items like , the shrimp po boy, the crab stuffed shrimp are no longer on the menu. No shrimp or crawfish  etoufee? Come on Emeril's , get back to your roots! The bill with tip came to $300 dollars with tip and we felt let down.",

    "text": "Emeril Lagasse grates my last nerve, so it was with much reluctance I allowed myself to be persuaded in here for lunch by some very convincing -- and hungry -- friends.  It was a fine experience, thankfully devoid of the man himself, but I wasn't blown away.  Husband really liked his gumbo, with spicy, smoky andouille.  My oyster and rock shrimp po' boy -- which wasn't listed on the menu, but the waiter mentioned I could combine the two options if I so desired in a sandwich cleverly named, \"The Peacemaker.\" -- was quite good.  Light, crunchy cornmeal batter, *tons* of fresh, lovely seafood, and a chewy, crunchy-exteriored homemade baguette.  But they were accompanied by a bag (literally, they were still in the celo) of Zapp's Tabasco chips.  You can't make your own, Emeril?  I get they're a Gulf Coast delicacy, but they just seemed out of place at this semi-swank eatery next to my $16 sandwich.  My dining companions weren't as lucky with their meals.  Two ordered the flank steak salads with medium-rare meat -- but the meat was *so* rare it was practically mooing.  Another ordered a burger medium-rare, and encountered the opposite problem.  It was *so* cooked air escaped when she bit into it.  She sent it back only to have the second one come out with a pulse.  Sent it back for round three, and it finally came out right.  Dinner rolls before the meal were totally dry and tasted like they'd just been picked up at the grocery store in the day-old section.  At the recommendation (repeated insistence) of a friend, tho, we tried the banana cream pie.  Ridiculous.  The best thing we ate.  By far.  Cocktails were good, ambiance pleasant, and our server was great -- really personable and chatty, and quite attentive.  But overall, I wasn't enchanted by Mr. Lagasse's New Orleans Fish House.  Mostly because I could feel his irritating presence lingering in the air...BAAAMMM!  [Top Chef: Emeril Lagasse]",

My guess was either the salmon or the banana crime pie. This had all the ear marks of staph poisoning . My shrimp was over cooked and cold,his salmon was undercooked and blah. The wine was ordered incorrectly and the staff became surly and indifferent when it was brought to their attention. It was restaurant week in Vegas and the menu was there but concealed behind other menu pages. Stay away from this restaurant it is hazardous to your health.",

I ordered a bourbon smash from the menu and the waiter said, \"We don't have those.\" I kindly pointed out that it was on the menu and he told me, \"Oh. Well, I'll see what I can do.\" The dinner arrived before the drinks.   My Dad's jambalaya was cold, my Mother's fish was undercooked and rubbery, not to mention they did not put her sauce on the side. The chicken that came with my salad was charred and dry. When the drinks finally arrived they were watered down. My bourbon smash was some odd colored mix of mint and lime juice. The quality of service, and food/drinks was absolutely unacceptable for the price. We'd have done much better if we had just eaten at the food court.",

    "text": "NEVER NEVER AGAIN will I eat at Emeril's Restaurant.    I go to Las Vegas about once per month and usually stay at the MGM, because I believe they have the finest collection of restaurants of any hotel on the strip.  While I don't find the food amazing at Emeril's, it's at least reasonable (although known for being too heavy handed with the salt shaker) and one of the best choices usually for lunch at MGM.... until last week.  My girlfriend and I were sitting at my usual spot at the bar.... it was only about 3/4 full having a bowl of clam chowder & wedge salad.... Not bad, but very, very average.  Our waiter was flirting with a customer at the bar about 5 people down from me.  He would go between the customer & his co-worker behind the bar, chuckling laughing & ignoring EVERYONE else at the bar.  Myself, my girlfriend and 2 other restaurant guests were trying to get his attention (he was 3 -10 feet away at all times) for 8-10 minutes, but despite all of us calling for him, he deliberately ignored all of us and kept talking to his co-worker, until we all collectively started yelling for his attention.  His co-worker turned to us and became very aggressive and told us they were busy.... Apparently he didn't realize we were actually there watching them not work, just joke with each other.  I informed the manager and he said he would talk with him..... he walked over to him and gave him of those \"pretend I'm upset with you\" kind of speeches.  After the manager spoke with them, all we received were intimidating stares from the two behind the bar, with no remorse for their behavior... or even apologies for a misunderstanding, if there had been one.  In the end it showed that the service and the management at Emeril's have no passion or care for their food, their clients or their restaurant.... and in the city of Las Vegas there are many many other choices that will always be better.  I told 12 of my professional associates and I know the others that were subject to the behavior told others too.  None of us will ever return.",

The only thing that was alright in my opinion was the mussels $10 at Happy Hour .In addition the MGM is now charging for parking.

    "text": "I'm totally stoked that on my very first trip to Vegas I got to enjoy a celebrity chef's restaurants.  There were a few at the MGM, so it was hard to decide which one to choose. It basically came down to the fact that we were starving and wanted immediate seating.  No regrets though.  For example, I never order chicken in a restaurant.  Never.  I think my local supermarkets make delicious $5 rotisserie chickens and every time I order it at a restaurant its dry.  But I'll get to that later.  Atmosphere: Pleasant.  Felt a little underdressed wearing t-shirts and hoodies because there were linens on the table and the servers were well dressed.  The location of the restaurant in the reference to the hotel was just outside the food court area so it kinda felt like the restaurant was in a mall, but hey its Vegas, there's gonna be commotion wherever you go.  Service:  Awesome, I didn't catch our servers name, but he was attentive and wasn't overly aggressive.  Menu: Being a fish house, we probably should have had something from the sea.  However my date was from Hawaii, he's got plenty of access to some fresh fish.  Besides you've got lay down a substantial foundation before drinking heavily and fish just isn't going to cut it.  Wine list: Absolutely phenomenal.  The list was about the size of my high school yearbook.  Holy crap.  Food-Appetizer-braised short rib and polenta: Good stuff, but at this point we were starving, so who knows?  There was a baked crust on the polenta and the short rib was nice and tender.  Food-Chicken: I had the lemon herb chicken and it was juicy, but of course I attacked the dark meat and was too full to finish the breast.  I want to attack with my hands, but had to knife and fork it due to the classiness of this place.  My entree came accompanied with a wilted frisee salad, which really isn't my thing.  Ate all the tomatoes though.  There was a potato gratin that was crusted with gruyere.  The cheese was good, but I kinda felt like potatoes were a little al dente for my taste.  Date's Food-Pork porterhouse:  Who knew such a cut even existed?  Pork is another thing that I never order because it's usually overdone.  It was a little pink in the middle and was actually really good.  I think there was some apple reduction sauce, but to be honest I was too involved with my chicken and wine to really investigate his dish.  Besides he looked like he was enjoying his dish.  The last thing I'd want to do is interrupt a man while he's eating.    Overall experience: Awesome.  Would I return?  Don't think I'll be returning to Vegas anytime soon.  Besides there are a million in one restaurants there...so there's really no need to eat at the same one twice.",

A big show is made out of the serving, bringing it in it's own little fancy pot to be then poured into your bowl. Interesting enough, but taste wise, hard to distinguish from canned clam chowder. It also tasted like the potatoes weren't quite cooked through.  Our table had various sandwiches/burgers. I had a shrimp po'boy that was decent, the spices actually gave it a very nice new orleans kick.  It came with chips which I assumed would be homemade but instead was just given a bag of chips.  Seemed a little strange for a restaurant that is more towards the upscale side.  I'm not a high-maintenance diner, however there were a number of service/execution issues here.  A couple burgers appeared to be undercooked, ordered as medium but instead borderline rare.  And we weren't offered refills or the check to settle up in a timely manner.  Our waiter seemed like a nice enough person, but unattentive.  Given that the lunch crowd was very light this day and it seemed the restaurant was fully staffed, it's harder for me to accept the poor service.",

Our visit to the Fish House was a couple of years ago, so my memory is somewhat fuzzy on what the other people in our group had to eat.  However, I remember distinctly that we all thoroughly enjoyed everything - appetizers, entrees and dessert.  The atmosphere was modern and fresh (for some reason, I kept picturing some semi-cheezy casual environment with wooden planks - something stereotypical that you would see on the wharf) - it was elegant and spacious.  Service was great.  Emeril's Fish House is in the MGM Grand, and from the moment we walked into the hotel to when we got to the restaurant, it must have taken us 10-15 minutes to get there.

    "text": "We were on a hunt for food before seeing a show at the Garden and settled on Emeril's. I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites.   Unfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a \"mainstream\" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril.   First, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....  So, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a \"crustini\". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable.   Worst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court.   The food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life.   The BFF's two cents on the experience? \"Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced\". Sums it up completely,",

The Mr. and I began our meal with the Rock Shrimp ceviche as well as the Lobster Bisque. Both were very tasty. The Lobster Bisque was very creamy (although we enjoyed Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak more). The ceviche was on the spicy side (a very good kick). The Mr. ordered the seabass which was ok. He was not a fan of it but ended up eating most of my wonderful entree. I ordered the bbq salmon. OMG! so freaken delicious The bbq sauce was delicate and in no way resemble the \"ordinary\" stuff (usually super sweet). I will definitely come back because the food was just so darn delicious. Well - my salmon dish was very very good.",

I was mainly looked at the seafood dishes and they all had some form on pork in it.  I can see why New Orleans is an over weight town.  Emeril should know the the reason a lot of folks order chicken or seafood is because they don't eat pork.  The location in the MGM rand was good.  We ended up ordering a host of appetizers and sides to avoid the pork.  The alligator meatballs could have used less salt and more flavor.  That was such an amateur culinary tactic to add salt in lieu of flavor.  I think the dessert menu also needs something lemon to complement the fish.",

I would like to say that the reason I'm scoring this restaurant so low was just because of the hectic and very unorganized service. Could be attributed to the preparation for their party in the evening. But the food was also just very poor. After waiting forty minutes, we started with oysters which were not prepared correctly and the wedge salad, which lacked flavor entirely. I then had the BBQ shrimp which were overcooked and came with nothing else but a tiny, silver dollar size hard biscuit. My husband had the crusted tuna/ahi sand witch. The fish was awful, mushy, cut incorrectly and lacked flavor. Even if the service had been better, I still would not recommend this restaurant and won't be eating here again. Big disappointment.",

    "text": "No disrespect to Emeril but he needs to do a quality check on the food at this place.  Here's the breakdown... 1) Gumbo - good ... but can't even compare to Commander's Palace.  My own gumbo tastes waay better.  A little heavy on the salt...not enough cajun seasonings.  It just didnt have flare. 2) Clam Chowder - good but tasted like any other place that serves chowder with bacon.  Find some clams with LESS SAND. 3) I had a Special of the day Fish with Prawns (forgot what it was called).  The fish was cooked nicely.  The sauce was a litle overbearing (chipotle sauce).  And who the heck puts tortilla chips ON TOP of the fish?  Just doesn't work. 4) Scallop Noodles: Somebody lay off the butter.  There was so much heavy cream and butter that it was totally inedible.  I know cajun dishes are heavy on butter/cream but c'mon.... this was just rediculous.  The scallops were cooked to perfection however. 5) Crab cakes - Pure meat.  The crab was fresh.  However, it needs a little somethin.... what happened to the \"essence\" of emeril??? Gimme some more \"BAM\" seasoning 6) Short ribs - TERRIBLE.  An overcooked piece of tasteless meat.  Try adding some wine, seasoning... ANYTHING!!! 7) Jambalaya - pretty good.  Some more andouille sausage would be nice. 8) Bread pudding - decent.  Nothing exceptional. 9) Apple cobbler - TERRIBLE.  Tasted like sweet glue.  Someone needs to quality check the apples, I think they might be bad.  We told the waiter and he offered to exchange it for us but we didn't want anymore food. 10) Had a bottle of Chianti The grapes were tasty, however, the wine kept making me sneeze.  It usually only happens when I drink cheap wine....I kept telling myself the bottle was 70 dollars. ===========================  According to my dad, he claims that the restaurant tastes WAAAAY better at lunch (much cheaper too) .  Service was decent, environment was nice.  There's the two stars.  The food certainly didn't match the price.  Why did you close down Commander's Palace (I sure hope it reopens soon)??? Emeril's fish house doesn't even compare in quality/price.  Maybe my tongue has become too sharp.... Cheers to fine dining.",

We were there on a Sunday, so the waits people were complaining about didn't effect us...althou we were warned when someone ordered the pork chop they take a long time to cook...  Due to the $$$ and being on a work expense budget, my pals and I had to stay away from the bar items, and stuck with plain old beer. The bread and whipped butter was fantastic thou!   I had the house salad for 12 bucks and a deep fried salmon sushi roll of sorts...I have had better sushi rolls in my life. I liked it better than one of the other people there with me...I actually ate the whole thing. My salad was pretty good...the white cheddar in it made it better off than an average house salad...dressing had a good flavor to it.   Everyone seemed to think their meals were ok, nothing great, nothing horrible....most of us got 2 appetizers as opposed to a crazy expensive entree. I am sure at places like this it varies by the night...but to be honest I didn't really catch on to the \"New Orleans' theme of the dishes either.",

My dinner menu consisted of: Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham, Gumbo, Warm Spinach and Lobster Salad, and Emeril's Banana Creme Pie.  First of all, cheese and ham is just cheese and ham.  Therefore my only comment on the Marinated Mozzarella & Serrano Ham is \"absurd!\"  The gumbo was good, but not great.  Actually, I think plain old Gumbo is too dull for Emeril's fancy menu.  My favorite dish was the \"salad\" because it wasn't really a salad.  It was a big fat piece of lobster meat that had warm spinach as a side.  YUMMY!  Then waiter's recommended Banana Creme Pie was a pleasant way to end the meal but it wasn't better than an ordinary Marie Callenders pie.    This posh restaurant was placed in the right spot of MGM grand.  The concept of the decor was dimly complex that it boggle me on why he would portray New Orleans like this.    All I have to say is Go Saints!  Next time I want to experience New Orleans, I better go to Louisana because Emeril failed to bring it to Vegas.",

The dressing, to add insult to injury, was so salty that it was impossible to choke down.  Soup, lobster bisque, also revoltingly salty.  The foie gras was acceptable - except for yet another overly salty port wine reduction.  A beautiful piece of well aged steak was ruined by a pile of sauteed crap.  Seemed to be vegetables, but so overcooked, that it was hard to tell what you were eating.  This vegetable mush was, again, so salty that it was inedible.  Once you scraped off the salty debris, you could choke down the steak - barely.  Service?  Slower than molasses and unfriendly to boot.  We asked for pepper 2 times and it never showed up.  I heard from a bartender in the hotel that Emeril sold it to Martha Stewart.  Hmm.  Any connection?  A complete waste of good ingredients and primo space.",

We had 3 kinds of wine and different mixed drinks. All came out quickly and tasted great. 3 of our party had the tasting menu. (I can't recall if it was 4 or 5 courses) Timing was great. Complimentary bread, salads and appetizers rolled out right on time and entrees directly after.(pretzel rolls were my favorite!)  We didn't have to rush thru anything to get to our entrees or wait for our entree. It was impeccable timing! Mushroom toast and bbq shrimp were both great. We had Caesar and apple salads with crunchy sweet toasted nuts..everything was so delicious we were all just passing around and sampling off each others plates. I had the fisherman's stew...DELISH! Light, fragrant broth, perfectly cooked shrimp and shellfish and flaky fish! We had 3 ribeyes, all cooked differently and all to perfection!  This is rare! The pork chop was charred on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The butterfish was perfection! We sent an additional tip back to the cooks to show our appreciation and how thrilled we were with everything!   Entire time our waitress was attentive and on top of things but never bothersome... Then came desserts (yum) I believe we tried everything they had except the beignets. My favorite was the bread pudding by far! I will be recommending this place to anyone who makes makes the trip to Vegas for sure and I know my family will as well! Great job to the whole staff and Emeril Emeril and mgm! This is an outstanding restaurant!",

    "text": "From what I'm reading, this must be one of those hit-or-miss places depending on who is working that night. In my experience, HIT all the way! First of all, the bacon and fontina macaroni and cheese was out of this world. Every bite was better than the one before it. For my entree, I ordered the All-American Angus burger (not exactly the most refined item on the menu, but I wanted to see how it tasted), and, as expected, was delicious. The fries it came with weren't very remarkable, but the sandwich... I'm the type of person to devour his food before his taste buds process its flavor, but I was doing everything in my power to make this meal last as long as possible. Also, our server that night was nothing short of incredible. Not only was he was polite, friendly and attentive, but he gave my girlfriend an employee discount on the check just because she works inside the MGM, and gave us a passion fruit sorbet to split because her birthday was 5 days before that night. If every other experience is like the one I had, I will DEFINITELY be back.",

(see? to me that's an indication that maybe a surprise is involved?) We sit at the table and our server comes over and says -- loudly -- so, I hear I need to find a cake. d'Oh! 2. If you've ever been at a restaurant with a large group and seen well orchestrated service it's beautiful, subtle, artistic. Here? The servers all gathered and stood (not so quietly) in back of us. Then, the server (yes, the same one who loudly announced our cake) said, loudly, On My Mark and counted 1,2, 3. and then plop. all the plates clattered to the table.  So on to the food -- it was fine. edible. but again, not memorable. we went because it was in the MGM grand and good for a group. would I recommend it? no. Did it completely suck? no.",

Very good. *   Cream of mushroom soup.  Sister-in-law says it was delicious. *   Barbecue shrimp.  A signature dish.  Brother says it was very good. *   Grilled hebi (spearfish).  Medium to large filet, thick, grilled, with chive olive oil.  Served on a bed of potato pieces, orange, and onions.  Very good; brother also had this dish, and agrees. *   Pecan crusted Texas redfish:  SIL says \"very good.\" *   Banana cream pie with banana crust, chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce.  Tall wedge of pie.  Very dense, rich banana cream with pieces of banana.  Thick layer of good whipped cream.  All three of us thought it was excellent (and I'm not very fond of banana cream pie).  My brother has been to Emeril's before, and thinks very highly of the place.  I liked it a lot, but nothing knocked my socks off.  Still, it is one of the better restaurants I've tried - much better than I would have expected from a restaurant empire.  I may not return for a meal, but I'll be back for a piece of that banana cream pie!",

Why and How can I be so dumb???  The second thing that happens is I enjoy my food and service so much! I have ordered many things on the menu including raw stuff and various fish dishes and now I could just close my eyes and point and I know it would be good. It is great to eat before any concert at the MGM Grand Garden, and the decor is so beautiful with a really pretty open bar and glass partition to the main walkway to the studio walk. I suggest this any night of the week!!",

We also had bland crab cakes at the table, tried the DELICIOUS mac n cheese and had another small shrimp salad that was good.  The guys got steaks and everything was just ok, cept that SALMON!! good god! We got the butterscotch creme brulee and all shared it.  Came with sugar cookies and whipped cream.  Nothing special.

    "text": "Right off the bat, Emeril's was one of my top 5 dining experiences of my life.  It was a combination of impeccable service, well prepared and artfully displayed food, amazing wine, and the company of a great group of people.  I decided to join two friends and asked if they could change their reservation from 2 people to 3.  The front desk had absolutely no problem accommodating that change....or our change to 4 on the morning of the reservation or changing to 5 that afternoon....and no problem at all to accommodate our 6th guest that suprised us at the last moment.  I'm in the restaurant business and hate people like me who change their reservation over and over again!!!  We were seated at a large round table and presented with menus.  My eyes went directly to the 6 course chef's tasting menu with wine pairings and I knew exactly what I was having.  Wound up 5 out of the 6 of us went this direction.  We were presented with a complimentary first course of ahi tartar--compliments of our server Rocco.  As we went through the rest of the meal (I'll edit the review and post the menu, but I don't have it in front of me right now) our servers introduced each wine and each course with confidence.  They really knew a lot about the wines and how they complimented each course.  Everything tasted amazing, except for the striped sea bass with gnocci and red wine braised leeks.  The sea bass tasted amazing by itself, but was overpowered by a gorgonzola sauce and fresh tomato paste.  The leaks were grey/pink and the gnocci was gray and bland.  As a whole the dish was visually unappealing, lacking in texture, and the flavors were way out of balance.  After dessert and coffee, I noticed we were the only table left in the restaurant and the Manager and Chef were sitting at the bar.  We asked for the check--we were not presented the check until we asked for it, a very nice touch considering we were lingering, sipping coffee, and conversing after every other table left.",

Emeril's menu seemed to have us covered, and during their happy hour (bar-only), it seemed fortuitous.    We ate half a dozen oysters at their happy-hour prices, which were a good start.  The prie fixe menu - soup, salad, entree and dessert seemed like a good deal, as well.  The duck confit salad was surprisingly luxurious.  The clam chowder was sufficiently clammy and salty.  The entree of Sweet Barbecue Glazed Salmon was plentiful and filling, while also being more sweet than anything.    My friend's entree of what looked to be Scallops in Spaghetti looked down right sad.  Barely a tiny bowl's worth of food, and it honestly looked like it came from a can.  Yes, spaghetti from a can, with tiny scallops added to it.    Dessert came and went, the Bread Pudding being extremely buttery.  The service was courteous when they came by at the bar, but otherwise, they were really more interested in whatever else they were doing - maybe setting up for the rest of the night, filling table orders.  All in all - did I feel like my dinner was worth the $63?  Yes, it's a fair value for the strip.  My friends?  Not even close.  I miss Seablue.",

I mean, Emeril wasn't here to personally kick it up a notch, so how could I be guaranteed that my food would indeed meet his standards of notch-kicking?  I was wrong.  sidenote, I ran through my usual repertoire of quoting Futurama: \"c'mon Elzar, kick it up another notch with your spice weasel!\" \"if you promise to stop interrupting, alright. against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch\"  I tried the whiskey-marinated roast beef po'boy, wanting to see how po'boys stack up against the sandwiches I'm used to. It was a huge sandwich - I want to say a foot-long, with a hearty helping of beef, lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo.  the sandwich also came with \"Zapp's spicy\" potato chips. and now, more Futurama jokes spilt out: \"Brannigan's chips are like Brannigan's love: hard, and fast\". but they were quite tasty - kettle cooked chips for the win.  my advice - go during lunch. a huge, tasty, filling sandwich and some sodas will run you about $17 - in this town, that's quite a deal!  you can also purchase Emeril products, like his hot sauce. the decor is nice, not shabby but not uncomfortably upscale.  and now, if anyone needs me, I'll be in the Angry Dome.",

Cons: A bit of a wait (go here when you're not starving and have time to hang out) almost too eager bus boys and hosts.  We wanted to get dinner before the Eagles Concert Sunday, 5/24/15 and a lot of places weren't taking reservations or had wait times from 45 mins to one hour. We didn't give this place much thought because as much as I love seafood, my boyfriend can't stand it. Luckily they offered steak and a burger entree so he was okay with it. Even luckier, they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. We had two waitresses and like three other people waiting on us (removing corn bread baskets, emptying plates and refilling water) it was kind of confusing and I could tell my boyfriend was getting annoyed by the constant refilling of water and the fact that the waitress didn't mention the beer he was getting was non-alcoholic even though he asked what the percentage of alcohol was (it should've been on the menu). I almost gave my first 5 star rating if it weren't for these little discrepancies. My boyfriend got the all American Angus burger which he said was decent. I got the seafood pan roast which consisted of chef's selection of fish medallions, mussels and gulf shrimp, seafood and andouille pork sausage jambalaya with lemon butter sauce. OH MY GOODNESS. Best combination of seafood I've ever had. The fish (I don't even know what kind of fish it was) melted in my mouth. Everything was seasoned perfectly and I enjoyed every single bite. The wait was well worth it and I'm happy we randomly ended up here. It was the seafood God's will.",

    "text": "Food was fantastic!!  But be sure to check your bill if you are ordering from a happy hour menu.  It is Vegas, tourist traps are everywhere and businesses/workers are savvy about how to get you trapped.   It was around 5pm, we wanted to grab something light and quick before going KA.  Many MGM dining does not open until 5:30.... this restaurant was a few it was open when we get there.  We looked their menu at the front desk and it was what I like.  After we were seated, we realized the menu we saw at the front desk was a happy hour menu.  So we moved to the bar area, grab one of a bar table it was available without any napkins and utensils. When a server (female) came, I asked her we want to order from a happy hour menu and she said okay and gave us a happy hour menu.  Later, a different server (male) came and took our orders.  I was pointed at couple of items from the happy hour menu and 1 item from a regular menu.  If you are ordering mojito, make sure which mojito you are ordering.   I said \"mojito\" meaning that the mojito in a happy hour menu, \"Fish House mojito ($7)\" but the server asked if I am ordering the \"tropical mojito\"? which cost you $15, he did not explain the difference in between my mojito and the tropical mojito so I've got an impression that he just attempted to sell higher priced item.  Nothing wrong with the tropical mojito, it is sounds like a nice mojito if you would like to spend extra money and sugar for experiment.   We finished everything, everything was amazing.  When bill came out, we were charged for a regular price on everything!!!!   I told the server and he said the happy hour menu is only at the bar counter not at a bar table.  I was very clear with the lady who gave me a happy hour menu when I seated.   And why he did not tell me when he saw I was ordering out from the happy hour menu?   More over, a bar table, I mean a small round high table (with no napkins or utensils) in a bar area normally considered to be a bar, eligible for a happy hour menu at least in Seattle.     Anyway, he fixed the price to a happy hour menu price (except one item which I could have mentioned but I didn't).    I would give them 5 stars if I did not have confusing experience about their happy hour system and the server did not attempted to sell me a higher price mojito.",

I was in Vegas for four nights and had oysters at four restaurants and these were definitely the best. They were the biggest and most flavorful, and also came with the best vinaigrette sauce - not to mention the best price in town. We had a couple dozen oysters and also tried the shrimp cocktail which was a big disappointment after the oyster victory. I'd definitely return just for the oysters and skip the shrimp next time.",

The food was exceptional, however although the service was attentive our server droned on for almost 3 minutes about the menu, instead of just letting us decide what we wanted to order. I don't necessarily need a very lengthy oral presentation of the food, rather I would just like to order my food and enjoy in peace. If it wasn't for the theatrics of the server, who came off as fake, I would have given Emeril's the five star. The pecan pie dessert is absolutely to die for!",

When it went way down hill, I stopped going... approximately 15 years ago... too many great restaurants popped up to give it another try.  Recently I read a review claiming that it had been redecorated and a new great chef was in place... well we were going to be at the MGM so we stopped in for lunch.  The redecoration consisted of removing the gate which makes you feel like you are dining on the walkway... kind of foodcourtish... fail  My appetizer was the $24 crab cake.  It tasted OK, but they did not use lump crab.  It seemed like frozen Dungeness and was covered with some sort of cream sauce... fail.  My wife's appetizer was the $18 sweet corn chowder with lobster.  They brought out a bowl with 2 tiny pieces of lobster (I guess to prove that there was any) and then drowned them in an overly sweet corn puree... fail  My shrimp po'boy got sent back, as the shrimp were cold and the bread was rock hard... inedible... big fail.  My wife had the prosciutto flat bread... overcooked and uninspired... fail.  Service was also uninspired... pleasant enough, but my wife was never asked if she wanted a refill on her wine, we were never offered coffee or dessert.  The high point of the meal was the fact that they offered Pride Viognier by the glass... in fact the only thing this restaurant has going for it is the wine program.  I have had similar poor experiences at Emeril's Delmonico restaurant.  Here is yet another celebrity chef that needs to spend more time at his locations and less time on TV.",

In town for convention and saw empty seat at bar and knowing I wanted to eat light I picked it so I could have fish. A mistake. $14 for a tiny kale salad that thankfully I ordered dressing on side courtesy of another yelper commenting it was too sweet.  I expect a larger portion for $14. It was more like a normal restaurant $5 side salad portion.  I ordered a special of the day.  Trout. It was overcooked and a bit dry.  The crawfish on top was horribly fishy tasting and hopefully won't make me sick tonight. I'd skip this place if I was you.  That said. I've found most dining experiences in Las Vegas these days to be grossly overpriced and barely enjoyable. Vegas used to be a great place to eat decent food at reasonable prices.

My BBQ salmon was completely overcooked despite me requesting \"medium\", and everything was terribly salty. To be honest, I probably could've cooked a better serve of salmon. The sauce pretty much tasted like BBQ sauce from a bottle.   To be fair, my partner's scallops were large and very well cooked, though again a bit heavy on the seasoning.

Placed an order for 2 Filet's - only to hear that they were out of that cut of steak.   BAM, disappointing!   The \"creamy\" mashed potatoes were soupy and inedible.   BAM... You get the point.     The jambalaya came out cold.     Burger for the kids cooked medium well?   How about ground beef consistency in the middle.  It was medium at best.  Sent it back and due to the length of time we had been waiting we just had it removed from the bill as my kids were now tired and hungry only having eaten the side of fries and pretzel rolls for dinner.   Great.      Bourbon sweet potatoes?   Oily and over seasoned with cinnamon and no Bourbon flavor.    Let our server, Don, know about our dissatisfaction and a manager never even made his way to the table to check on us.  Did I mention that after we expressed our dissatisfaction to him he had another server bring over our check.   He never came back to check on us after we expressed our displeasure.  Poor execution.    Overall sorely disappointed.    Asked for the General Managers name, (Sean?) but not even worth the effort to write a letter.     BAM! Won't be back...",

    "text": "Our lunch at the Fish House was interesting.  It was a Saturday, but the back half of the place was empty.  This is where our group of 5 was seated.  I don't know if they forgot about us back there, but the service left a lot to be desired.  We waited a long time on our food, and for the check.  So, that was a little annoying.  I had the clam chowder, which was very good but lacked seasoning.  It is brought to you in a metal, maybe cast iron (I don't know), bowl.  Then, it's poured into your bowl to eat.  This kept the soup hot until the end, which I liked.  Good size pieces of clam and a lot of potatoes.  Certainly hearty.  But, like I said, lacked seasoning so I had to add salt and pepper.  My wife had the caesar salad.  This was 2 large slices of romaine with a good amount of dressing.  It was too acidic for my tastes.  There were 2 long cheese breadsticks that were good though.  I had the fried shrimp po' boy for my entree.  I really liked this sandwich.  I took my first bite and found the bread overwhelming the meal.  So, I (like the other 2 at our table that ordered this) ate the remainder open faced.  This was the way to go.  It's a good sauce with some kick and plenty of shrimp.  Never had a bite without shrimp, which a lot of places skimp on in sandwiches.  I will definitely get this again.  It's served with creole fries.  These were long and thin and had seasoning on them.  They were also good, and I got so many I didn't come close to finishing them.  The shrimp and grits (which my wife ordered) was not as successful.  The shrimp were overcooked and the grits lacked flavor.  I think they needed more cheese.  Also, the sauce lacked heat that you would expect at a cajun/creole place.  So, we likely won't get this again.  But, the meal wasn't a bust for me, I recommend the shrimp po' boy.",

    "text": "Emeril's has been bookmarked for a while so I was excited that my boss wanted to eat here.  I stayed at the MGM so it was awesome that we just had to go downstairs for dinner.  The circular bar is at the entrance of the restaurant and the bar staff was pretty friendly.  I arrived early at around 7pm and the restaurant looked about half empty so I was a little confused to why a 7pm reservation wasn't available.. weird.  The decor was nice but you could get away with jeans and a polo; the two walls enclosing the restaurant were lined with bottles of wine.  For starters, we ordered the Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp.  The calamari was tender and crispy, but nothing spectacular.  The BBQ shrimp were wild blue shrimp-- again, very tender and the BBQ sauce wasn't too heavy.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FH5u097W2ywgDx5evASoyRQ%2Fl.jpg&s=33b1997c2d935aaf67e194307fc7824dfeaad47d3aaf66519e860ac540def400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FWLv7aTEh8wDr6vfY_AlvjQ%2Fl.jpg&s=dd21740eb65107fd675544eba17bf8991ebcbc59fb39192eda576eaf02978d52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  I knew I would order a fish entree since this is a fish house, and I freaking love fish!   I was torn between the pan roasted sea bass, the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, and the whole grilled American Black Bass.  Our waiter Gus was really helpful and suggested the whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass.  The two Bass's were market price, so I knew they would both be pretty fresh.    I was pretty shocked when the fish came out because it was a lot bigger than I had anticipated-- the bass barely fit on my plate and it literally was the whole fish!  The grilled/charred criss-crossed skin looked great (I love charr!) and the bass was Citrus and Herb stuffed with Chardonnay Agrodulce.  The whole fish was perfectly cooked-- very juicy and flakey!  The best part were the cheeks, charred skin, and the belly (i love the fatty part).  I ate it all.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FWAbM_0y6h2Q8OLy3BKLiLQ%2Fl.jpg&s=e83dcb5e9d67f6877f1c57a84cc786be85e83ff4e93d08a7fc081251116fd805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  The Wine menu was huge compared to the food menu so we had to ask the sommelier to help us out.  Our table ordered all different entrees: fish, etouffee, and steak, so he suggested we go with a Pinot Noir.  We ordered a bottle of the 2010 A.P Vin.  I was surprised that the wine wasn't corked; it was a screw top which I thought was odd.  The wine was pretty fruity and paired nicely with our entrees.   For Dessert, I had the Banana Cream Pie.  YUM!  I love how they use whole slices of banana instead of mashing the banana in with the filling.  The pie was garnished with caramel sauce and chocolate shavings.  The ratio of the pie was 50% banana, 50% cream, so I didn't feel too guilty about polishing it off.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FdE08svm378CZOkRgk-Q5Fg%2Fl.jpg&s=bb46bb5a9ae7d91e2162bb6e2d603d6714ef8c39521a3fe4ce0fe2fdcf8781f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  I tried some of my co worker's Frozen Key Lime Mousse Pie.  If you like tart, you will love this!  The creamy part of the pie and the coconut cookies mellows out the tartness of the frozen lime.  It also comes with a Mandarin orange coulis(a pureed sauce) which helped balance out the sweet and sour-ness of the pie.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FlLCza292bSMRstYxdqdt8Q%2Fl.jpg&s=617e4687c66dc53c9e64841c0f318f79f954dfcd398768e00f2fde9b28df7bfe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>  I'm definitely coming back here to try the other seafood dishes!",

I was not a member of Yelp during my vacation to Las Vegas 5 months ago, but my visit here is still fresh in my mind! When my boyfriend and I first arrived in Vegas, Emeril's was the place we wanted to go for lunch, after hearing about it on the Food Network. It wasn't very busy, so we got seated quickly with a view of the casino mall. My first desire was to try the infamous banana cream pie. But we thought we had better eat something substantial first, then dessert afterward. I started out with a fresh green salad and bowl of seafood gumbo that was perfectly seasoned! The bread basket contained hot, homemade assortments of breads & rolls. That was hard not to keep eating it all! Finally, the time came for the grand finale! Already, I was getting full, but I just HAD to at least split the banana cream pie with my boyfriend. Our waiter was wonderful and kept doting on us throughout our meal. We were feeling very special as he talked us into trying their famous bread pudding with whiskey sauce, along with the pie. So we split both desserts and thought we were in heaven! Then soon after, the waiter brought us samples of more desserts on the house. He wanted us to try their different flavors of sorbets. Other diners were looking at us like we were gluttons for dessert! Everything tasted outstanding! We finally waddled out of the restaurant so full, that we needed to get to our room for a period of rest & digestion. Too bad our friends who were supposed to meet us there, missed their plane! They really missed out on this memorable dining experience!",

So tasty that we actually almost ordered a second one (my boyfriend and I shared one) had it not been for the amazing bread pudding!  I am running short on adjectives to adequately describe how good the food was!  Definitely go and order the whole grilled lobster and bread pudding!

(and after reading all the yelp reviews about the banana cream pie....)  We were seated and handed a wine list...no...make that a wine novel. We were instructed that if we wanted wines by the glass, to turn to page 52. No lie.  This was a little daunting, so we just went with sodas. To start, we shared a blue crab bake that came with creole spiced crostinis. My husband is still drooling over this. I'm afraid to mention it again in case for fear of him packing his bags and flying back to Vegas just to get some. It was THAT good.   For an entree he got the tamarind glazed pork medallions that came with some stuffing and on top of a little dollop of sweet potato puree. I had a bite, and it was so good.  I had the Ribeye steak, which came with a side of mashed potato. It was cooked some sort of \"emeril's special\" steak sauce. It was very very good.   Last  but not least, the desserts. Our waiter started walking over with the dessert menu, and i said no thank you, i don't need a menu, i'll have the banana cream pie. It was probably the most scrumptious thing i've ever eaten. (well, dessert wise, anyhow). My husband got the s'more tart, which he also thoroughly enjoyed.  Our waiter, Doug, was very attentive and an overall nice guy. Also, I bought a tshirt (gotta get some emeril-abilia) and it wasn't rediculously priced like i thought-- only 9.99! Thanks Emeril!",

The signature New Orleans Barbeque Shrimp were to die for. There's nothing traditional barbeque about these shrimp, there's just 3 shrimp sitting on a plate that have been cooked in the most flavorful reduced sauce ever. Save the rolls that are put on the table until the shrimp arrive so that you can mop up the sauce. You also can't go wrong with the Fried Oysters with Old Fashioned Remoulade and Apple Smoked Bacon Bibb Lettuce Tossed in Apple Cider Dressing and Cornbread Croutons. The oysters were cooked perfectly and loved the remoulade sauce with them. I did wish the oysters breading had a little more crunch and the cornbread croutons were a little less dry but I'd order this again.  The only disappointment, but it didn't keep me from eating them, were the Beignets with Powdered Sugar and Coffee Ice Cream. The beignets were not quite up to Cafe du Monde status. My suggestion if you do need your beignets fix is to tear it in half and spoon the coffee ice cream into it.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch to save a little $$ after splurging at Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys the night before... As amazing as that meal was, our lunch at Emeril's was just as good, and that's sayin' somethin'. My hubby had the clam chowder and I had the scallops with risotto for an appetizer. We could have split the scallops, it was a really large portion for an appy and SO DELICIOUS. I forget the type of cheese it was made with, but it was creamy with a touch of spiciness which I LOVED. I ordered the Scottish salmon with the andouille hash--again, this was spicy and sooo delicious. Hubby ordered the sea bass with orzo and I sampled his and it was excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, everything was seasoned so wonderfully and I loved the spicy Creole heat to the dishes. By then we were so stuffed that dessert wasn't an option. This was my favorite meal of our Las Vegas trip. The only complaint was that since it was lunchtime, the waiter was a little too intrusive (and a bit weird to be perfectly honest), but with such great food, that's easily overlooked. This is a must-dine on your next trip to Vegas.  I would recommend going for lunch since it's less $$ too.",

I think they had lobster and loads of butter and cream in them.  I should have paid better attention, but I would definitely make sure to order some of the spuds.

    "text": "We were so fortunate to get two seats at the bar of Emeril's NO Fish House at the MGM Grand in Vegas!!!  This place was packed, most of us waiting in great anticipation for Neil Diamond's concert just around the corner.  We had to stand like sharks and wait to grab our seats as the next guests left, but boy were we glad we did!   We spent the next hour or so enjoying a fabulous lemon creme brulee and several cocktails.  As many of you know, I'm on the hunt for \"real, original, great looking and tasting\" appletinis and I finally found it at Emeril's!  However, it was only because I spoke to the bartender personally about the ingredients he would used and asked him to substitute \"sweet and sour\" with Midori.   With that settled, I receive the beautiful, bright green appletini with that burst of flavor only Pucker & Midori can deliver.   I asked for another (not realizing my bartender had changed) and he brought me the cheap, sweet & sour, dirty-martini-looking drink and I told him that was not what I had previously and then had to tell him how to make it).  At least I held my ground and didn't just drink it to be nice.   At $17 to $20 a pop for cocktails in Vegas - get what YOU want, not what you are SERVED!!!   We had such a good time at this bar.  It is absolutely gorgeous and the crowd was fun.  We even had the Neil Diamond look-alike sitting three chairs away from us.  It was too funny - he looked just like Neil did in the 70's!  He, He.  ONLY IN VEGAS!!!",

Nice layout and attractive decorations.  Negatives: One of the worst waitresses I have ever had.  She was a miserable b!tch.  If that is not the career path you want then do something else!  Just because you are miserable doesn't mean you have to bring everyone to your level.  Should have gotten a manager but I was so shocked I actually was at a loss.   I had been trying to come here for ages, every trip to Vegas in fact since I had heard it had opened.  To have such a terrible experience purely due to service is honestly heartbreaking considering how good the food is.  The sad part is that even though I know the food is good that I dont know if I will ever go back.",

He seemed really annoyed with us. I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.  The guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling. There were staff complaining about tips from other tables openly.   Improve the personality of your staff and restaurant and perhaps we will go back some day.",

I knew there was trouble when they handed it to a manager and told him it was overcooked, and his response was \"Again?\"  Still spent $70 (with tip) AFTER they took off a significant amount for the lobster.

The attire is business casual and the staff is super friendly. I've tried many things on the menu and i've have no complaints about the food.  If you are willing to spend money, try the chefs menu for that night!! The prices vary every night because it's always a different menu. We've paid anywhere from $75 a person to $125 a person and it's soooo worth it! It's typically a 6 course meal including dessert. My favorite appetizer was the tuna tartar.  The only downfall about this restaurant is the food coma after you get after the meal! You're in vegas and you don't really feel like going out anymore!!!",

Emeril's Sweet Barbecued Scottish Salmon Andouille Sausage & Brabant Potatoes with Spicy Onion Crust and Emeril's Homemade Worcestershire: a very tender piece of salmon, but clearly not worth the $33 something price. I've had the same exact salmon many times. Nothing made his dish unique nor worth it's price. 3 stars because it did nothing for me to justify being at Emeril's.  Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken Gruyere Cheese, Onion & Potato Gratin, Baby Frisee & Cherry Tomatoes Horseradish Brandy Demi Glace: my friend ordered this and it was very tasty.

    "text": "I had several trusted family members and a few yelpers with similar tastes as myself tell me that I needed to make a stop at Emeril's.  They all told me the same thing, service was top notch, the food was amazing and every single one of them gave me rave reviews and stories about their evening.  So I marked it as a place we had to stop off at.  Let me just say that I do not hate Emeril the chef.  And while I can't stand to sit down and watch his cook show, I actually respect him as a cook, more importantly as a philanthropist, with the foundations he has set up and all the work he has done to repairing New Orleans.  That said I think I could have just given one of those foundations 200 bucks cash, and I think I would have been left feeling more satisfied then I did dinning and paying for the meal that I had here.  So let's begin with the evening, we started out all well and good, and we wanted to try the chefs tasting menu, my g/f who is much smaller then me didn't think she could handle eating four courses, so what we wanted to do was I would order the 4 course tasting menu, and she would pick out three dishes of her own, she was going to get a salad, soup and main and we were just going to split the dessert.  The server then told us we couldn't because the kitchen couldn't get the timing on the dishes going out to the table.  I then asked would it make it better if we ordered two desserts, to which he said no.  He then went and told us that if we each are sitting at the same table and wanted to do the chefs tasting menu we each had to order it.  I asked him, if I were to come alone would I be allowed to order the tasting menu, and he told me I could.  I couldn't figure out or understand why it would be different if two people were sitting at the same table.  Anywho we both got the tasting menu in the end.  Salad:  Blue crab meat, red onion, carrot, cucumber & mixed greens tossed in sweet soy vinaigrette, with fried pickled ginger and sesame seeds.  Simple clean flavors, the crab meat was cooked to keep it's natural sweetness and delicate texture which was great, however the vinaigrette was a bit strong for my tastes can seemed to overpower then entire dish.  It was an OK dish, it did seem like it was something I could go to any fusion-asian restaurant though.  Seafood:  Sweet Barbecued Loch Duart Salmon on Andouille, sausage and potato brabants with spicy onion crust and Emeril's housemade Worcestershire.  With all the work and things that they did for this dish, it was ultimately forgettable at best, what ever was on the crust for flavor was long gone by the time I got to eat it and with all the elements that went into creating this dish I thought it would have had a bigger impact, additionally, with all the ingredients the presentation of the dish was sloppy.  Meat:  Grilled Pork Tenderloin & baja shrimp on white cheddar, cheese and chive mashed potatoes with caramelized onion reduction and flash fried kale.  What can I say about this dish?  This is where things went really down hill.  We got our dishes and first thing I notice is that the portion sizes are different, mine is smaller and more rectangular then hers, and even without cutting it open I knew my piece was way, overcooked, her's on the other hand was pretty questionably undercooked.  (Bloody pork.)  I thought the reason we did this all this was so they could get the cooking time right on the tasting menu!  I was dumbfounded and flagged a server, (ours was no where to be seen) she then looked at it and told us it was normal.  I told her it was the pork dish from the tasting menu not a beef dish.  She then took it back and the chef's went and re-fired her meat.  Desert:  Apple Strudel with Caramel Sauce, Caramel ice cream and whipped cream.  I really didn't get this dish, I thought it was supposed to be a warm strudel dish but that could be enjoyed with the ice cream and Caramel sauce, it was cold the entire dish was cold.  The pastry shell on top was soggy and cold throughout, it was actually frozen to the bottom of the plate.  It was inedible.  Two bites and we were done.  Sadly the one good thing that stood out from this night is the bread, it was the only thing that I could say was really good and memorable.  The rest of the menu was forgettable, poorly executed, and frankly a disappointment.  We saw our server only a few times that night, when he came to take our order, when he brought two of our four dishes and the check.  That was it, sadly, it was a very slow weekend, the restaurant was very empty and there was an abundance of wait staff, and bus boys, but for some reason they were all to busy to refill drinks.  The couples at the other tables next to us said they noticed the same thing.    So sorry guys, Emeril's may have been a great restaurant at one time, but it wasn't when we were there, and with all the choices of restaurants in Vegas these days, there are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money.",

When they brought the water it was in fact large and shareable however the waiter filled two glasses and then took the bottle away????  No check back from waiter until the very end of our meal.

Anywho, looked through the menu and I decided to get something off the dinner menu and the bf wanted to have the tasting menu. Sounds good yea? No. we can't do that.  The waiter came by and said we both had to do the tasting menu so the timing of the food would be the same.... Ok.... you couldn't have told us when you handed us the menus? Thanks! Let's spend another few minutes choosing. Well, since we weren't going to be in LV that often, we decided to spurge and both do the petite tasting menu for $65. Not bad for  4 courses. But I wasn't really digging the choices.   Mixed greens with crab meat in soy vinaigrette - Really soy sauce? not the flavors I was hoping for. Wasn't bad tho, tasty and sweet.  Seared Salmon with potatoes and sausage - Nothing special, not memorable at all, but tasted ok. How unmemorable? Well, as I was waiting for my 3rd course to be RECOOKED, I could not recall this dish...  Pork tenterloin with cheesey mash potatoes -  Ok to be fair I wasn't looking forward to this dish because I already had an Awesome pork tenderloin the night before at Mesa Grill, so expectations may have been set a bit high... but my god I wasn't expecting this. Since we both had the same dish, you'd expect them to be executed the same. Nope, never assume.  I first took a bite of the mash potatoes and noticed it was cool, so I touched the plate but it was kinda luke warm. The pork sauce was cold. The meat was more on the rare side of medium rare, tho I asked for medium. Who cooks pork rare? Do I look like I wanna take a gamble for a tapeworm?  The bf's was medium so I had a piece of his. Flavors were decent, but once again nothing special. Back to my rare piggie...  We called for a waiter who asked what's wrong. I told him my pork was raw and he called another waitress to help. She asked if it was ok if she brought out another one. So I agreed and they took my raw one away. Lo and behold I get my 3 but pieces back.  Are they suppose to recook the same pieces?  At least the mash potatoes were warm this time. I actually didn't know there was cheese in it the first time since it was so cold, the cheese wasn't stringy. Took 2 bits and called it quits. It was still a little too pink for me.  By now I really just wanted to leave, but we still had dessert. They had apple strudel listed. Confused, but hoped for the best because for a restaurant of this caliber if they have something this simple, it must be good! Once again, do not assume... (I don't gamble, this is why: I suck at it)  Apple strudel with ice cream- Strudel was pale white, ice cold, chewy, doughy and just plain uncooked.  The plating of the items was also not centered.  (Please see picture) What a lovely way to end the evening.   If you are coming here, I do not recommend the tasting menu.   There was one thing I did like tho, the dinner roll. It was light, fluffy and fresh. I recommend that. I had 2.",

    "text": "My star is more like 1.5 than 2. Oh boy, why did I choose here for our LV dinner? I was watching Emeril Green on TV and wondered if he had any restaurants in So Cal. But the closest place he had was in LV. I just happened to be there in a month so I thought it would be a great idea to try his food as a special dinner for me and my bf because we only had one night in Vegas.   We ordered Crab Cake for appetizer. The cake itself was a bit salty for my taste but it was good. But I don't know why they put their deep-fried(almost burned taste), over-seasoned bread aside which came with the cake. I think it's too salty and too hard to go with the cake. When I bit off, it crumbled and fell on my skirt:(  For our entre, we ordered Mahi Mahi, which came surprisingly unseasoned comparing to the crab cake. It came on the top of mashed potato with no gravy or no taste what so ever... So I suppose I eat nearly unseasoned Mahi Mahi with unseasoned mashed potato...? I've never tasted anything like this before and I did not like it. The fish was too dry for my taste anyway.  For dessert, we ordered his famous banana pie. ...It wasn't bad but it wasn't extraordinary either. I've had much better ones before. Other than that, their customer service was very nice and professional. I loved their bread too.  Maybe we didn't order the right meals. Maybe we are from different country with different taste. But I can tell you it did not worth the money I paid.",

So we went, and pretty much from the time we sat down it was disappointing..  First our waiter/waitress team intorduced themselves, of which really only the waittress said anything, through a very thick hispanic accent..  She left, and then we didn't see anyone for about 15 minutes.  The male waitor came back and and asked us if we 'wanted the food' yet... We asked if we could order some drinks first..  Anyway, service was just odd.  I ordered the Gumbo and Rib Eye. The gumbo was fantastic once i loaded it up with tabasco, otherwise it was quite bland and lacking seasoning that I would call 'cajun'.   The Rib Eye was clearly a dissapointment. It was a good portion but thin, and as would one expect a juicy steak, this was not. It was cooked well but not juicy, majorly because it was served only luke warm.  After being a fan of Emeril for such a long time, I really expected more... But this disappointed.",

We had some of the appetizers on their happy hour menu. The grilled oysters, bbq shrimp and some gumbo. All of our choices were delicious. I especially liked the grilled oysters. The butter sauce went so good with the garlic bread that is on the side. The bbq shrimp were pretty good, my husband enjoyed those more than me. The biscuit it came with was soft and tasty too. We both liked the gumbo which had good flavor. We live in Houston and whenever I try gumbo here it tends to be overly salty. That was not the case here. It was seasoned well and it had lots of little shrimp so the portion was filling in itself. I had an Emeril's coffee which  I could have drank infinity of. It wasn't boozy but perfectly sweet enough with a little caffeine to get me through the evening. When we were trying to get out of there it took a while to get our check and what not. They were pretty busy so it was understandable. Overall we had a great experience here and would come back next time were in the area.",

    "text": "We decided to splurge last time we were in vegas and hit this place up. When you're considering a buffet, you always worry about lines, especially on a Friday night at 7:30. The nice thing about this place is that it's spacious and had no wait!  Each section has its own dedicated wait staff that takes your orders, brings your water and bread, etc. They only leave your section to grab drinks from the bar. Otherwise they have their own service station with anything you need right there. Our drinks were always kept full and we were never waiting on anything for more than a minute or so.   We tried a couple different items. First, we started off with Poke and my wife had the mussels. Everything was to die for and super fresh. I ordered gumbo and beer-braised rib roast and it was incredible. Everything came out quickly and the food was just delicious. It ended up being about 40 dollars or so per person, which is about what you'd expect to spend on a nice buffet on the strip.   We were both stuffed, but saved just enough room for the banana creme pie....which was heavenly. I really wanted the pecan pie but after all the comments about the banana creme pie, we had to give it a shot. If you're on the fence about it, do it. You won't regret it.   The entire meal was well worth what it cost. The atmosphere isn't too loud even though it's right on the walkway at the MGM with all the other restaurants nearby. The service was top-notch and the food was phenomenal. The only thing missing was Emeril himself coming and seasoning our dishes and giving us a \"BAM\" or two. World class experience that we'll be back for next time we're in vegas.",

    "text": "OK would be how I would describe Emeril's, I will start out by saying I am not a big seafood or creole fan so I am not a great judge of the food itself. The atmosphere in this restaurant is really beautiful, the decor is simplistic but elegant and it is tucked in the back part of the MGM so there is not as much foot traffic as there are in some of the other areas. The wait staff was friendly and very knowledgeable regarding food and cocktail selections.   Food being probably the most important part of a restaurant and I would judge it with 3 stars, it was really just OK, good but not great and for a chef who is know for his bold use of spices I though they under-seasoned and slightly overcooked. The portions are small (about what you would expect for an upscale establishment and everything is a la cart which can very quickly add to the cost of the meal. I will say the side dish that had Cheesy Home-style Grits were absolutely delicious but at a cost of $15.00 for a pretty simple dish it was in my opinion over priced.      Finally the service is extremely slow, the wait staff was very attentive but the kitchen took a long time to have the food ready. Not a huge problem if you are looking to spend time with friends but since we were going to a show after dinner it became a bit of an issue. This was also on a slow night as the whole place was at best 1/2 to 3/4 seated so I can only imagine how they would operate on a busy night.   Overall I would not recommend them to anyone but if a friend or guest wanted to go I also wouldn't put up a fuss. With so many choices in Las Vegas this establishment just fell short, hopefully they will step up their game because it truly is a very nice ambiance.",

My whiskey bread pudding for dessert was the perfect amount of sweet.   The service was great and definitely top end restaurant service.",

The guy who brought it out seemed like he was just mad to be working that day or something. We walked away and sat down at a table in the Casino excited to take a bite. It looked like it was thrown in there a was mashed up. It also tasted it like it was frozen a couple of times. Just very disappointed",

While the restaurants in the MGM hotel are \"open\" because you can see the gaggle of crowds walking by, this place still gives a nice intimate feel.  I came here with about 5-6 coworkers and we were able to have nice dinner conversation.   What I ordered:  -Seafood gumbo:  This had a nice kick to it and had a good amount of seafood and veggies to it.  I really liked it and wanted another plate, but decided not to.    -Seafood pan roast - a good amount of seafood and sausage. It wasn't the largest portion and I thought it could have been bigger, but everything went well together. From the fish to the mussels to the sausage, it was an explosion of flavours.  Overall, if you have the budget, this is a great place to try in Vegas.",

I was impressed with the wait staff. They were on top on keeping our drinks full. That is where it started going way down hill. It took over 45 minutes for them to bring us our food. When the food came out, it was lukewarm. The steak I order was not rare, like i ordered it. It was a very bland flavor. I expected the meat to be savoy; but, it missed the mark. The fries were cold and soggy. One of my coworkers had to remind the server about his drink he ordered. When he got it, you could tell it had been sitting awhile because the ice had melted.   I am sorry Emeril. Your place is way over priced and the food really is not that great. Perhaps you should revamp the menu, because I was not impressed.",

I come back today and now get treated poorly even before we get seated. The picture of the gentleman on my image display is the individual that made me lose my appetite.   It's sad that as a Noir rewards member, I got treated horribly perhaps because I was not dressed appropriately and was in shorts and a t-shirt. I've eaten here many times before without incident and now Tom whom doesn't seem to acknowledge that myself and 7 guest are in front of him is acting rude. Rather than paying us attention, he's staring at his computer alongside his assistants without even a hello or welcome greeting.   Mr. Tom, you have a job because of paying return patrons like myself. Try practicing humility sometime, it might be a little refreshing.   Management, please look into this because I'm sure it's not an isolated incident by the negative reviews already posted prior!",

We even had a manager to comp a dish for a hiccup not even worth mentioning. The staff is great. One person even remembered we were celebrating  our anniversary and offered us sherbet served with coffee and a  how sweet is that. They care about service and pays attention to their customers.

    "text": "This was not my first choice to be honest. But they didn't look down on us by our casual attire like Tom Colicchio's restaurant right next door.  The service was great, they were on top of everything. Refilling water glasses, removing finished plates, and taking orders.  The free cornbread I would pass on. It had a lot of honey or honey flavoring. The cornbread itself was dry and almost tasteless save the honey. Maybe some nice chunks of corn and maybe making it slightly thicker and offering less of it.   Started with a salad. Roasted chicken atop mashed potatoes, sprinkled with brussel sprout leaves and bacon. The sauce that was around the plate was delicious. I feel like there could have been some textural differences in the plate. Everything was soft. Maybe a crisp to the brussels, flash fried or the bacon. Small piece of chicken, but tasty.   Ordered the 16 oz boneless ribeye. Came out perfect medium rare.  It had a side head of roasted garlic and topped with a rosemary twig.  It was delicious with the worcheshire sauce, but there could have been more of that especially with a 16 oz steak.   Ordered brocollini, tasted more charred than anything. I like charred on meat, but this almost tasted only of ash on raw vegetables.  I think grilled to a perfect al dente would have been nice. I didn't taste any of the other flavors it was supposed to have.  Lemon... nope!  The cajun fries were good, a mixed batch of old and new it seemed. Or it could have been the cut.    Ended the evening off with the lemon cheesecake. Deliciousness, light cheesecake with lemon flavor served with fresh berries. We devoured it.  The crust was still a crisp.",

Light, fluffy and not too sweet, this bread was the best corn bread I have ever tasted.  The jumbo shrimp were fabulous. Perfectly cooked, with just a hint of garnish. The tuna in the poke was some of the best raw tuna I have had the pleasure of eating. So fresh and tender, it almost melted away in your mouth. The poke was only lightly seasoned.

From the waiter, bus boy, etc--everyone was tremendous.  Definitely felt like a valued customer!  Wifey got the lobster roll and I opted for a daily special of salmon over jambalaya.  Our meal started with complimentary cornbread.  Fresh & warm, this hit the spot!  We ate it all--there was none to spare!  We split their gumbo before our main entrees.  My wife loved the gumbo.  Had just a shade of heat--nothing too much to handle.  This would be great for a hangover cure!  Wife kept talking of the gumbo throughout our meal and now wants to try cooking gumbo!  I am a willing guinea pig for her cooking experiments!  :-D  Lobster rolls are easy hits and this was delish!  Yummy lobster covered in aioli wrapped is a soft, sweet brioche bun.  Throw in their homemade-like chips and you have a happy wife!  My salmon over jambalaya... Meh, it was OK.  I expected stronger cajun flavors especially with the jambalaya, but it was fairly bland.  4 stars--not a must-try but you won't be disappointed here!",

    "text": "I was disappointed really. Overall it doesn't  live up to the hype and based on my own expectations, I felt that I leaned towards over valuing stars just because I have always appreciated Emeril as a chef. However, Vegas presents itself as a marketing machine for famous chefs to put a restaurant in place that I doubt the namesake visits much at all.   I visited at lunch, and ordered the lobster roll. It was basically a small hotdog bun with maybe 1 ounce of lobster. In my particular roll the lobster stopped an inch short of the end of the bun which was not cut open. It was just bun.  The kettle chips were tough and tasted a bit charred.   What went well? We were seated immediately at the bar, and service was fine. The actual taste of the roll was tasty but minimal. Think of a tablespoon of lobster.   So, from the quad pillars of culinary excellence, here is the outcome-  Facility- 3 stars- really crowded and situated to maximize seated customers. It's difficult to get around. Also, it's quite loud.   Service - 3 stars- it was good- not a best practice benchmark, but good.  Food - 2 stars, the chips were not great, the slaw was bland, and the roll was not great.   Value - 1 Star - not a lot of value here. It was a forgettable experience and the lobster roll was disappointed. For $24  dollars I venture to guess the cost of goods was less than $3 to make, and that is just bad.   That's 2 stars. And while it is on par and very similar to the other \"namesake\" restaurants in the area, it doesn't distinguish itself.",

We decided to go here for one of my good friends birthday dinner just by googling we chose this spot and plus she loves seafood (and so do I) sooo it was a great choice in my opinion lol. The setting was very cute and the service was very warm and welcoming. We actually all got the same meal expect for one, I think she got something with pork or lamb. So yes you could say the pasta was a big hit around the table. Even-though most of the dishes were the same it was still fun sampling each other's pasta, the more the merrier! After our meal was done they came out and sang my friend happy birthday and gave her a desert on the house! We took pictures and shared in each other's company it was so much fun!",

Heres a question for you: What kind of \"Fish House\" only serves trout and salmon on the entire menu. So for a low price of $30 I can choose between a fish you can catch in lake mead vs a fish you can buy at any grocery store. And this is suppose to be a strip quality seafood restaurant? The service is ungodly slow on top of that as well. We arrived 2 hours prior to a show we were seeing at the MGM Arena (which is literally 30 seconds away from the restaurant) thinking we would have plenty of time to eat. We ended up not being able to order dessert because we ran out of time. Stay clear of this awful excuse of a high quality downtown restaurant. You have many other choices for your money and time.",

    "text": "I have actually been going to Emeril's occasionally over the past 20 years, and it hasn't changed much at all, but what has varied has been on the downside.  Of course Emeril's serves standard New Orleans fare, such as pecan-crusted redfish, gumbo, oysters, etc.  The ambiance is a bit dated, with an oyster bar, large Vegas-style wine wall, dark red rugs and curtains, and large formal tables and chairs.  The service is friendly, but a bit confused the last time we were there, with two servers sharing the duties on our table and not talking to each other enough.  There are three problems here, the first of which has always been the case, while the other two have developed over the years.  1.  The prices are high.  This is typical for a Las Vegas resort restaurant, but they are still too high. 2.  The food is not always completely right.  The server assured me the recipes had not changed for many years, so I guess the execution is to blame.  For example, the BBQ shrimp were awash in a sauce that was far too salty.  The redfish, on the other hand, seemed to rely on the pecan crust for flavor but had no other discernible seasoning.  The old standby - banana cream pie - was not as smooth and creamy as I remember it (maybe not quite thawed).   3.  There used to be an exciting atmosphere in Emeril's, but this time it was totally lacking.  Partly this may be due to there not being many tables occupied, but the old \"we're good and we know it\" attitude has disappeared.  It makes Emeril's less fun.",

I ordered the shrimp and grits entree also a side of sausage and shrimp jambalaya. The shrimp and grits were amazing, perfectly seasoned! The jambalaya was mediocre.

    "text": "Emeril Lagasse's Cajun specialty restaurant, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, located in the famous MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. Emeril Lagasse is an American celebrity chef, whose specialty includes Cajun, Creole and French. And did I mention that he is also a James Beard Award winner and have semi-regular appearances on Bravo's Top Chef? Now you know why we came here.  For starter, we had the Maine Lobster Bisque and the Gumbo. The decision to order the Gumbo was self-explanatory. We were at a Cajun restaurant after all. I found the gumbo to be a bit salty and a bit too peppery, although my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I ordered the lobster bisque because, well, it is one of my favourite dishes of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster bisque, it had fantastic lobster flavours... briny and savoury. It was the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin. However, it had little white clumps throughout the bisque, likely undissolved corn starch or flour, whatever they used to thicken the bisque. They also could have put in a few more chunks of lobster... It's okay, I understand, lobsters don't grow on trees, do they now? Despite the flour clumps and the lack of chunky lobsters, the bisque was excellent. I would order it again in a heartbeat.  For the main course, we had the Crystal Fried Shrimp Po Boy and Emeril's Barbecued Shrimp. I found both dishes to be on the salty side. Unfortunately the Shrimp Po Boy, which I was so looking forward to, turned out to be a disappointment. The saltiness covered all other flavours.  Not ideal. The upside is that the portion sizes were humongous. Come here on an empty tummy!  I documented my whole Las Vegas trip on my blog, please come and visit for reviews on other restaurants and loads of pictures! ;)  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsimplygluttonous.blogspot.ca%2F2013%2F08%2Femerils-new-orleans-fish-house-mgm.html&s=d27a752c2036f7105fe9dd8cec59413f45a71e5d36f4baec89592dcf88f992e9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">simplygluttonous.blogspo...</a>",

Price:  Average for a good fine dining restaurant.  Food:  - They give you three different types of complimentary bread which were not really my kind of taste. - The lobster bisque had amazing flavor and was the best I've tried so far. - Had Point Judith Calamari with salad for starters which tasted normal. - The color of the ribeye suggested it was cooked just right but the plating didn't look appealing and it reminded me that Fish Houses do not specialize in steaks. - Blue Crabmeat Stuffed Shrimp was amazing. - Pudding was good but nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "Seafood is probably my favorite kind of food.  I have almost more cravings for fish than I do for chocolate.  Other than cupcakes, I think fish is way up there in the \"in love\" department.  It's healthy and when cooked well, it's divine!  Our stay in Las Vegas was about to be filled with numerous celebratory activities and to start off or long weekend of shenanigans we, oy, the birthday girl ;o) , chose Emeril's New Orleans Fish House for her birthday.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly, albeit next to the kitchen, but promptly.   It was nice a fancy here, a wee bit more fancy than anticipated, yet we kept our optimism on high ground.  This was a good and a not so good thing.  As our order were taken and waters were being brought out, and the bread, we were already famished.  Granted, we were a large party and the waiters were doing their best to attend to tables as fast as they could, we couldn't help but notice a few of our table's missing waters several times throughout our dining experience.  It took awhile for our appetizers to come, but when it did, we were delighted.  Like some other reviews have stated, the calamari was pretty delicious.   And I'm not particularly a calamari fan.    Our meals finally got to comin' and I went the safe route: salmon.  It was no ordinary salmon though, it was Emeril's Barbecued Salmon with andouille & potato hash - crispy onion crust - Emeril's Worcestershire sauce:  $32 . <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=85w_lWKGU8buRpmWaaLuQg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8...</a>    I really did enjoy this dish, and so did the bf.  He and his bro ordered this pasta which they loved.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=SVLhDRMNBQ8xqPhX2WTtPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8...</a> Dessert:  My BF and I ordered the Butterscotch creme brulee with two sugar cookies. This was the highlight of our dinner! It was just marvelous!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og?select=-8VEbYBrsB1nR6AgMVfWcg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BjH8...</a> So the three stars doesn't come from the food, it was definitely delicious.  A bit pricey, well no, it WAS pricey for what we got, but it was good.  It unfortunately goes to the service.  The MIA water refills for some of our party, and the very very long wait to find our waiter so we can pay our bill.  That was a little bit of a downer too.  The food is worth trying here, perhaps I would come for lunch though, so I won't be breaking my bank account and wishing I bought a new dress instead of an expensive dinner.   *side note: they do give a little somethin' somethin' for someone who is there to celebrate a birthday. All equipped with a lighted candle *Cue the happy birthday song*  yes.  Yelp 365 Challenge: 71/ 365",

    "text": "My husband and I love emeril and our favorite restaurant of his was Delmonicos but we were going to see the Jabbawockies show and decided to try this restaurant of Emeril's. I started with the cocktail called Fishhouse punch no. 2 and it was delicious perfect combo of sweet and sour and had a unique flavor. My husband got the mowie wowie I am sure I killed the spelling on that and he said it was ok. We started with the crab cakes which were delicious and I got  the gumbo which I thought was Ok but then again I am not a big gumbo fan but I thought Emeril's version would change that, but it didn't guess I am not a huge gumbo fan. I also got the marinated beet salad which was amazing! So much flavor! Then we got the bbq shrimp which was really good. My husband and I both got the short ribs as our main dish and it was really good and tender, melt in your mouth just like his steaks at Delmonicos are. Since we got the four course deal it came with dessert and I am not a dessert person I rarely ever get desserts at restaurants but since it came with it I got the bread pudding and it was THE best dessert I ever had! I was in love and I think about it often that's how good it was. My husband got Emeril's signature dessert the banana cream pie and he said it was the best he has ever had. I would also like to not the staff was very friendly and attentive and rushed our meals out towards the end when we let them know we had a show we had to get to. Definitely coming back her to try some of the other dishes since were so pleased! I didn't get any pictures of the food but I will next time! The complimentary cornbread was also very delicious but don't eat too much, save room for all the other wonderful food!",

The clam chowder was fantastic and didn't taste the least bit \"fishy\". The swordfish steak was tender, but was $ 35.  The scallops served with spaghetti squash and red bell pepper remoulade was tasty...BUT, the service was beyond SLOW. It took 2 hours for what should have been a 45 min meal. A very irate man with an East Coast / Jersey accent next table over was cursing as he told the waiter that he had been waiting way too long and demanded the rest of his meal to go and then stormed off. It seemed like they didn't have enough chefs working or something and the poor waitstaff just seemed tired and disappeared for 20 min at a time.",

Emiril did not disappoint.We started with wine, which took awhile to decide because the wine list was a huge book! I decided to go with the Riesling and the bf had Red,Red Wine which both satisfied our thirst for alcohol! For starters I had the clam chowder bowl and I am not lying when I say, best clam chowder in my life! Very creamy and flavorful. As my entree I ordered the lobster ($38). Very tasty but a small portion for the price but I know that's how it goes when you try to be fancy. LOL. The sauce in the lobster and ricotta was very creamy and delicious! The bf ordered New York strip steak and received a huge portion. He was very satisfied and I quote \"the best steak in my life!\" We ended with dessert and took our waiters suggestion and got the banana cream pie!! TO DIE FOR!!! This is a must try!! Rich, but not too sweet and every bite was pure satisfaction!   An overall amazing experience. The service was friendly and prompt. I swear the water guy would fill up our glasses once we took a sip. I had to tell him I was Ok after the 5th refill. A must go-to restaurant if you're in Vegas and near the MGM.",

I could have gotten most of the menu items anywhere.  Service for our big group was poor.  The restaurant management assigned 2-3 servers for our big table which is not enough.  Took our table 30 minutes to get water, another 15 minutes to get wine, and another hour to get our food orders in.  It would have been OK except the food was all cool (no longer hot).  Menu is very limited and definitely not New Orleans style (and I have been to New Orleans).  There are better restaurants to go in the area.  The banana cream pie was pretty good.",

Since we did not think to make reservations, we had to wait for a table and that wasn't even in the restaurant itself, but the outer part where people can see you when they walk by. Still, we did not mind seeing it was an opportunity of a lifetime to dine at one of Emeril Legasse's restaurants. The seasonal oysters with dipping sauces were great... as are fresh clams if they have them. Those were the highlights! Great sauces too accompanying them. If you prefer your seafood cooked, they have a big selection as well. For those of you who do not like seafood, well, there are things for you too such as chicken, pork chops, steak, but I highly recommend the seafood. There is gumbo as well, but I don't think it was THAT good. It wasn't bad, but not superb.",

The soonest available was 9:30, so we took it. Well there were plenty of seats open, just none of them were open to people till 9:30?!??!  Anyways, we sit down and I order a drink almost immediately which was promptly forgotten. I got my drink last...mind you everyone ordered drinks 5 minutes after I did and got theirs first, which still took 10 minutes to get. We also ordered oysters from a bus boy who said he was assisting the waiting but for some reason NEVER told ANYONE about the oyster order. So after about 15 minutes and having to flag the waiter down and even asking for bread, which was basically store bought crap-biscuits, we put our order in. About 30 minutes later, after asking where the food was, it finally showed up.  One thing they don't tell you is that it takes 25 minutes for the food to come out....I didn't know microwaves took that long.  The only thing that came out before I could finish asking for it was the bill. Crap Service = Crappier experience. Go to McDonalds in the food court and get the fish sandwich for a better experience.   Food - 7 Drink - 3 Service -  -8",

I started with the soup special, which was some sort of Thai chicken hot-and-sour type scenario and fairly good if unmemorable.  Then I had the tuna sashimi lettuce cups or somesuch.  They basically featured butter lettuce with crispy wonton strips, raw tuna, and thin slices of jalapeno with a sesame-soy type dressing.  AMAZING.  Really, really good.  I liked the decor, especially the fish sculptures at the entrance and the glass wine cellar in the center of the room.  Very spectacular, very Vegas.    I'd like to come back on an emptier stomach.",

Fondue is a misnomer for this dish. It was more like crackers with an avocado relish and a cheese dip. But it was completely delicious; I scarfed down every last crumb.  For the main dish, I ordered the mixed seafood dish and my boyfriend got the steak sandwich. The seafood dish was almost like a paella -- fish mixed with shrimp and clams and mussels in a risotto-like rice. Thankfully, the flavors weren't overwhelmingly fishy. The steak sandwich is served cold with a warm au jus accompaniment. It was good but so are the sandwiches you get at the corner deli.  We ended our meal with the banana cream pie. When we ate at the Emeril's in New Orleans several years ago, the pie stood out in my mind so I had to order it again to see if it deserved the pedestal I had placed it on. It did. It was a massive piece of pie with a ton of fresh bananas. THE BEST banana cream pie I have ever had.   If you're willing to drop some dough on a meal, this is a good option. I  might come back just for the pie.",

    "text": "Decor/ambience was nice.  Service was great. They bring enough servers to be able to place everyone's dishes in front of them simultaneously which I thought was pretty cool (I know, I'm a dork).  They start off by giving you a dinner roll and a piece of cornbread. Though they weren't bad, I expected more from Emeril. Of course I wouldn't downgrade a restaurant just because of bread but I love bread and good bread can certainly make a difference in your opinion of the restaurant.  The rest of the food, from the appetizers to the main course (we didn't have room for dessert, though I regret not trying the banana creme pie), was extremely flavorful. The gumbo had a nice little kick to it but it wasn't overpowering. The baked scallops on the half shell (3 per order) and the fried blue crab cakes were both quite tasty.  I ordered the barbecued salmon (I know, I never imagined joining those two things together) and I thought it was delicious. I usually prefer salmon raw because restaurants tend to overcook them and dry them out, but this one was cooked just right: tender, moist and full of flavor.  The prices were a bit higher than usual but that's what you get for eating at a place with a big name attached to it.  All in all, I enjoyed this meal. But I should mention... as flavorful as I thought the food was, I thought everything was a bit salty (if you're Korean, the more accurate word would be 'jjah') so keep that in mind when you go.",

    "text": "I don't mind spending money for a special occasion meal providing the food and the service are commensurate with a high-ticket entree.  (about $40 per entree.)  We arrived at 8:30pm and there barely was a wait.  The greeter was courteous.  When we first sat down, they promptly took our cocktail order and told us that water and bread would follow.    The good:  I had just ordered the same cocktail for dinner the night before at the Voo Doo Lounge.  The one at the other place was nothing to write home about, even though it was the same exact cocktail.  I don't know what they did differently, but the one I had here was truly spectacular.  I'd give it a 10.  I ordered a dirty martini using Grey Goose vodka.  The place was nicely decorated, on the main traffic isle to the concert arena (good for people watching), and was clean.  The bad:  They came around with bread, and you get just one piece of bread, the size of a garlic knot (not very big).  One of my dinner companions was very hungry and after asking, they finally came around with a plate full of bread, but the visual just served just as a tease.  She thought he was just gonna leave the whole plate.  Instead, he gave her just one, and moved on to other tables to pass out the other rolls and acted like it was the last bread on earth and he could only spare just one.  The wait for dinner was very long.  I didn't time it but I'm gonna guess to say it was 45 minutes.  I realize the kitchen might be backed up or something, but our waiter never came by to say he knew we were alive and we were up in 2 more tables (or whatever).  There was plenty of staff, in fact, they told us they were fully staffed that night gearing up for the exiting crowd (not until 11pm) from that night's AC/DC concert.  We were there during a non-busy time, as the restaurant was only about 75% to capacity and virtually no wait. For a $40 entree, I want my waiter to be on top of things and attentive.  Not only did we have a waiter, but we had a waiter's helper/busboy who came by with water refills and the like.  There really was no excuse I could think of to ignore us that long.  I had heard that the food here was so amazing that I simply couldn't wait to try it.  I ordered the Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish.  It was overcooked, very dry, and there was nothing special about it.  To me, the mark of good food is food combinations, seasoning, and the sauce.  Anyone can make fish, chicken, and steak.  It's what you pair it with and the sauce that floats my boat.  Anyway, there were no such good comments I could make.  There was no sauce or special flavors and the food pairings were nothing unusual.  How about you put together some Cajun seasonings or regional Louisiana cooking, for Pete's Sake?  I felt like I could have had the same fish for $10 at a local diner.  It was plain Jane and dried out.  It came with Coucous.  The coucous was very good, but hey, it's coucous.  Who can get excited about coucous?  It's like saying you got excited about rice.  The vegetable was asparagus.  I guess they put it on the grill as well.  It was so overdone that it brought back scary memories of my mom's generation when they used to boil vegetables to death.  It was completely wilted and also had no flavor or distinctive seasoning.  If you're gonna wilt it, then use some spices to rev up our palates.  If you're gonna make it plain, then serve it somewhat al dente so we can at least get in all our nutrients.  I ordered the Beignets.  The last time I was in New Orleans, I am ashamed to admit, I bypassed breakfast and instead ate beignets every day for breakfast along with my robust French coffee.  Those beignets made a lifetime lasting impression on me.  While La Gasse's beignets were edible, they weren't light and fluffy and were certainly forgettable.  I'm giving the restaurant a poor score for non-existent service (when they clearly weren't busy) and a meal that was no better than Denny's. DT",

It was pricey, but well worth the experience.  Each and every dish was fantastic and kept getting better as the meal progressed.  Before this meal, I was not a huge fan of salmon but now all I keep thinking about is Emeril's barbeque salmon with peach and bourbon sauce - yum!  The filet  mignon was pretty darn awesome too!  The wine pairings were nice and we were all introduced to some new favorites.  The service was excellent and the wait staff knowledgable.  We were seated on time and were close to the last ones out, but we never felt rushed.  All in all, an excellent time!  I give it 4 stars because they had run out of some main dishes at 8:30, but the tasting menu was as printed.",

The salad was fresh and we were given an adequate portion.  The salad dressing was good without being overwhelming.  Next we ordered the gumbo (being where we were it seemed like the thing to order) which was good even though the portions were not anything to write home about.  Next came dessert.  We were planning on each ordering the banana cream pie but the waiter talked us into an order of banana cream pie and an order of bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  We shared them and they were both awesome.  Then the waiter brought us three different flavors of sorbet on the house that were outstanding.   I know we did not try anything really challenging but I was completely satisfied with the service and the food and definitely would go back again.",

    "text": "We had a great meal at Emeril's. We let them know when we made our reservation that we wanted the chef to prepare a tasting menu for us. This was the fourth or fifth time we've done this and it is just a wonderful experience. As with any of the celebrity chef chain restaurants, the chefs normally need to follow the formula set out for them. By asking for the tasting menu, I think the chef gets the opportunity to be creative and in this case, James Richards ran with it. We also opted for a wine pairing and our sommelier, Scott McSimov, was great.  We started with a glass of Roederer champagne accompanied by oysters two ways - first chilled with a raspberry granita, lovely greens with a lemony dressing, followed by an oyster shooter which was slightly warm in a cream, bacon and tarragon sauce. The shooter was a standout for the evening.  We then progressed to a light white and I did not keep good track of the wines. We had a lake fish from Iowa accompanied by ramps in an onion vinegar dressing with a few roasted potatoes. It was very tasty, light and delicious.  The next course was a lovely perfectly cooked risotto with fresh peas and seared scallops. This was finished with manchego cheese and a dash of chardonnay vinegar to bring out the flavor of the wine pairing for this course.  The next course was a take on smoked salmon. It was salmon roasted on a cedar plank with some chopped egg and roasted tomatoes. I'm not a great fan of smokey flavors but the chef should get an A for effort and creativity. This was paired with a Pinot which worked well with the bolder flavor.  The final savory course was very unusually prepared using what I think was the Modernist technique. The ribeye was frozen solid, then seared with a blow torch (if I remember correctly), then cooked for hours. I think the intent is that it becomes very tender and remains rare throughout without the gray edge. This was paired with morels, mashed potatoes and a generous amount of very tasty foie gras. The accompanying full-bodied wine from Spain was a good match - Numanthia Termes. The steak was not as tender as I expected, but was very tasty.  We ended with a lovely dessert wine - Kracher from Austria - the famous banana cream pie and a turtle cheesecake.  All of the portions were very generous and we could really only have a bite or two of dessert.  During dinner, we learned that there is a kitchen table where we can also have this experience. We may opt for that if there are more than two of us, but our corner booth was very comfortable and we consider this a not-to-be-missed dinner each time we visit Vegas. We finished the evening with a tour of the kitchen and an invitation to return at lunch the next day for the famous Po-Boy. We were in a food coma and passed on this, regretfully. The dinner was $90pp with $55pp for the wine pairing.",

Once seated our waitress took about ten minutes to get to us, another ten for our glasses of wine. The food, though a bit pricy, was excellent in flavor and presentation, but not as fabulous as expected, except for the gumbo!!! The rib eye was okay, but unremarkable, the halibut was bland and SO SMALL..... Seafood salads were just okay....and food took about 40 mins. Had to ask for refills on water and ask for bread. I have to admit that I expected more from this restaurant than average food and bad service - in fact my friend was pissed at me for leaving a $20 tip on a $200 bill - she wanted to leave $1, and she's a waitress!!!! And that's after I had to have the manager take our bill up to cash it out after ten minutes waiting for the waitress......",

My brother and I were broke, and this place is spendy... so we decided to get something simple like soup, and an appetizer.  The soup was creamy with chunks of sausage, but it must not have been that phenomenal or putrid, because I don't remember what it tasted like.  I move on to order the crab cakes... I figure this is a famous dude's New Orleans kitchen, so the crab cakes would be sublime.... I was SO WRONG.  They were so fishy, I could not finish them.  To give you some insight, I cannot tolerate even the fishiest of an aftertaste..... salmon is out, sea bass, as is red snapper... pretty much EVERYTHING except for tuna (albacore), shrimp, and crab.  I loathe that pungent seafood taste with all of my being... maybe I was a fish in my past life??  Anyhow, crab is usually very tolerable to me, but this just grossed me out.  I felt like I was eating the dirtiest part of the ocean out, and she hadn't showered for a week.  Ugh.  Well, you see the four stars... you want to know why?  Not because of the pretentious waitstaff, who were so annoyed by my brother and my under-$50 tab... not the overdone, ugly decor, and the cheesy plates with Emeril's signature on them... not the pricelist.... the BANANA CREAM PIE.  This pie was A-MOTHERFUCKIN-MAZING.  In fact, my cousin was right.... this is this restaurant's Saving Grace.  I still have dreams about that pie, from it's light and rich-at-the-same-time whipped topping (with chocolate!!!!) to the firm, buttery bananas... to that golden, savory, perfectly-spiced crust (that my brother so awesomely called \"that  amazing junk on the bottom\") that just tied the whole thing together like a gift from the Gods.  This Banana Cream Pie is the only reason I would ever  grace Emeril's restaurant with my presence and hungry stomach... and hard-earned dollars.    Try it and you'll understand.",

I was a little ambivalent about our choice since it was a Thursday evening during Spring Break and there was no wait, especially for a big group.   We ordered tons of food.  We split the crab cakes to start.  I also ordered Emeril's mouth watering, best tasting corn chowder ever!  It was a splendid blend of cheese (which I absolutely love), bacon and corn.  It was a nice size bowl of soup that I could just eat for days straight.  I had a glass of wine which was also to die for, unfortunately I don't remember the name.    And of course if the appetizers and soup are magnificent, one would expect their main course to be a complete bombshell.  Oh was I in for a disappointment, I ordered the Opah with Emeril's own seasoning.  I hate to say it but it was the driest piece of fish that I have ever tasted.  I was immediately disappointed and really just wanted to order another cup of my bacon corn chowder.  I would return purely for the bowl of heavenly soup.  Mmmm mmm...  So I'd say this place was definitely not worth the hype. There are tons of other restaurants in Vegas that are worth the dollar.",

The dishes we ordered were better than expected and the service impeccable.    The butter lettuce tuna wraps were divine! Just the right amount of texture variation with an excellent crunch and fresh tuna sashimi.  Mmm, I'm craving it as type.  And the service was incredible attentive.  Very professional servers and the use of multiple servers allowed for the plates to be delivered simultaneously.  Loved it! If I lived in Vegas I would be a regular.    PS The decor was beautiful as do all restaurants in the MGM appear.",

    "text": "Just had a very memorable experience her this past weekend. We made a reservation and my boyfriend asked that since it was a date to make is special. When we arrived, they sat us right away at a round banquette that overlooked the entire restaurant from the back of the room. Perfect location. The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done.   We went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly.   thinking we were jsut getting \"tastes\" of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine. The \"wine guy\" (our own personal sommolier) gave a description of each after pouring, and the only complaint was that he was soft spoken so we had a hard time hearing him. They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good. After that i was so full of wine and stuffed with incredible food i just went back to our hotel and zonked out! ;-P  For anyone looking for a memorable dining experience, there's lots of celebrity chef restaurants out there but this one was really worth it. The bill came out to about $300 for two with tip, I believe (i just glanced at it as he opened it) Not bad at all.",

Started on a positive note, smiley waitress, the clam chowder came fast (the waitress said its same as the new England chowder but its different as hell it has bacon and crab meet and no mussels... also the potatoes inside were under cooked). Then the hell started 1HR of wait time for the main course! 1 bloody hour of wait, what kind of place calls itself a high end chef restaurant with people waiting so long, nobody apologized until finally i stood up and went to the manager. The manager said its normal because the food is good and fresh total nonsense! The food arrived and was amazing the pan fried cod was spectacular... but still 1 hour of wait?!?! Go eat somewhere else or be ready to drink a lot while waiting.",

So I looked at the menu and to my surprise it was my favorite time...Happy Hour! I wasn't super hungry so I sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and their bbq shrimp. Let me tell you this was the best thing I had while in Vegas ( I didn't have good food experiences). But don't be fooled by the name \"bbq shrimp\" because New Orleans bbq shrimp has a rich butter base with worchester sauce and white wine (yes I looked it up :) It was accompanied by a perfect sized biscuit to finish up the sauce. They had other interesting items on the Happy Hour menu but I had so much walking to do I figured I'd better not indulge. So for this review I know I only had 1 item but I think it's worth stopping in be it planned or by accident.",

My cousin and her husband held their wedding dinner here, and I have to say it was a memorable experience.   Appetizer - Complimentary cornbread: Flavorful, moist, and dense.   Appetizer - Alligator Meatballs: Thank you, Emeril, for introducing me to alligator meat, which is delicious, so move over chicken. This has a little bite to it, but it won't kill your taste buds.  Entree - Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish: I was wavering between this and the Sweet Barbecued Atlantic Salmon. Both are excellent choices. The redfish was tender and flaky, but the grits and veggie ratatouille stole the show.   Service - I have never witnessed waitstaff so synchronized when setting each diner's entree down all at once. Our server and his team were on point that evening.  Overall - Certainly, not my last visit. Food and service were superb.",

I can say through out the meal the staff where friendly and helpful.   We started with the Frog legs, a first for me. The crisp coating and wonderful sauces paired wonderfully with the light flavor of the frog legs.  My friend had just sides for dinner wanting to experience the New Orleans flavor.  Bourbon & Brown Sugar sweet potatoes: A sweet yet savory experience. The flavor of the sweet potatoe was not overpowered by the amazing sauce.  Shrimp Jambalya: Not very strong on the heat but strong on the flavor. The portion was amazing for a side. This one I recommend.  Slow Braised Collard Greens: Well I did not try this I was told it was wonderful.  I had the Pecan crusted Texas Rockfish. Let me say I have never liked grits until I ate them here. The grits on the bottom paired amazingly with the light flavor of the rockfish. My portion was cooked to perfection light and flaky.  My first experience with an Emeril restaurant and I will be back for sure.",

I got here on a Tuesday around 6pm and so it was not too packed but not slow either. The female bartender immediately asked if I was going to eat at the bar which I said \"yes\". (I'm hungry but not too hungry)   I ordered a wine. They brought over some fresh bread in a couple of minutes. I didn't even have to ask for water either. (You need it in Vegas). There's only one TV at the bar but better than none.   I ordered the gumbo which was hot/delicious. The only thing I wished for was more shrimp and more sausage in it. I had like two pieces. Lol call me cruel! Other than that it was so good. We should have 1/2 stars on yelp because not sure I should deduct an entire star for that or not. I just really wish I had even 2 more pieces of either one.   The bartenders are very friendly and I looked around and didn't hear anyone complaining about anything. I heard the bartenders make some small talk as well. I would def come back.   I heard the lunch menu is different so I would like to try that.   Prices are a bit steep as well but what do you expect??  I must say the guy next to me which had the chicken got more than I did at woolfgang pucks last night plus he had some fingerling potatoes to go with it.

Now that there are SO many amazing and high end restaurants in Vegas, it is really hard to choose one! After looking at quite a few restaurants, this one stood out to me the most.   We couldn't have been happier with our experience. Our servers, the wine selection, and the food were fantastic. Some of my favorite things we ordered were the cheese plate and the cheesy grits! We also ordered a seafood risotto dish that had andouille sausage. Do yourself a favor and order the grits as a side dish. They are so delicious.   This restaurant is beautiful. I was so happy with everything. I really enjoyed the ambiance. I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant.   We were planning on going to the Cirque du Soleil: KA show after (also located in the MGM Grand) and it was less than a 5 minute walk!",

Garden salad is a bit on the tart side but has some pleasant flavors. Croutons, radicchio, bib lettuce, cucumber, and a couple other unfamiliar items. The seafood gumbo is alright. Could be hotter in temperature but on the spice side it has a nice little kick. Comes with sausage, shrimp, and okra. The rice is a tad too \"al dente\" for me.  Second trip. Corn bread still a home run. Trying the collard greens and bacon Mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is really tasty with a nice crust. Nice sharpness but not too sharp. Greens taste great. They are meant to be shared. The Mac is a bit smaller.  Staff has been great.",

Not sure why, but we were there a week ago Friday, and had a fantastic meal made even better by excellent service.   We started with the bbq shrimp appetizer - amazing! For entrees, I had the chicken, hubby and our friend each had the porterhouse. We all loved every bite. Oh and the cornbread they serve before the meal - wow!!!   The servers asked at the outset if we had show tickets so they could accommodate our timing - very thoughtful!   Prices were also very fair for what was offered.   We had such a good time that the next night, we canceled our other dinner plans and had dinner here again! Cannot wait to come back and try the Po'Boy sandwich for lunch.",

Two of us in our party had hotel food comps ($150 & $100), so Mario took the time to split the bill so we could utilize our comps.  The food was delicious. We started off with a bowl of clam chowder and crab cakes. Some in our group had the dish sampler ($68) which was a 4 course meal consisting of crab salad, seasoned cod fish, steak, and dessert. I ordered the rib eye steak which was expertly seasoned and cooked. For dessert, we had the Banana Creme pie and the Banana Foster, simply outstanding.  Overall, the whole dining experience was enjoyable from waiter to food to drinks. A must-go dining establishment.",

Once we were at the restaurant the hostess greeted us and sat us down at our table. We were greet by two waiters that will tend to us.  Obviously, the restaurant has that southern seafood vibe through out the establishment. The waiters uniform brought even more of an unique take and added a lot to the atmosphere which look like a real fisherman's apron when they are catching fish. The uniform is made out the wax canvas just like a real fisherman's apron.   First, ask us what kind of beverage we would like to order. I ordered the NOLA peach tea. A real nice smooth to my taste buds. For starters we had the corn bread which is delicious and of the waiters told us they added apple sauce to the corn bread to have sweet taste. I ordered the crab cakes for appetizers. The crab cakes were decent. For me, it had a lot of fillers of corn and celery, did not of a whole lot of crab. I am used to having a cake full of crab but everyone has their different  take of crab cakes which I can respect that. In previous reviews everyone seemed to enjoyed the Pecan crusted red fish so I took a chance on ordering it. The taste of the fish was Ok and the sauce was just ok too. My boyfriend enjoyed his Creole seafood boil. His father enjoyed his shrimp and his mother enjoyed her salad. I do love the attentiveness and the drinks !  The place was not busy last week on Thursday which gave us super customer service and staff was very attentive. I would not mind coming back again and trying new items on the menu.",

The restaurant was slow so we had two servers attending to our table.   We shared a Shrimp Po-Boy ($16.00), Fries ($7.00) and Clam Chowder. ($12.00) The sandwich was the best Po-Boy that I have ever had. The shrimp was fresh and  plentiful. It taste like the perfect balance of shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickle and creole aioli. The clam chowder was light and not loaded down with potato. It was delicious but it had the tinniest amount of clams in it. The french  fries were good but not made to order. With a slow restaurant and a charge of $7.00 it should have been served freshly made.   After we finished we decided to order a small French Press Coffee ($7.00) and a slice of Banana Cream Pie. ($14.00) The pie was loaded with bananas and very tasty.",

    "text": "At the beginning of this current \"Celebrity Chef\" era there were few names on Emeril Lagasse's level, and although the Massachusetts native who made his name cooking in Louisiana has slowly faded from television his three Las Vegas Restaurants remain popular destinations with Emeril's New Orleans Fish House now pushing twenty-four years old inside the MGM Grand.  A survivor amidst shutters and re-brands, the space formerly housing Fiamma actually hosting its VIP opening as Ambra Italian Kitchen + Bar on this particular evening, it was promptly at 6:30pm that seven guests sat down inside the elegant space, General Manager Tyler Anderson having already coordinated a menu tallying approximately $90 per guest before tax, tip and Drinks.  Offering excellent customer service across two-and-a-half hours, Soft Drinks and Cocktails including the seductively sweet Razz-Matazz arriving quickly, it was following an Amuse from Chef Ken Lum that dinner got rolling, a big basket of Corn Bread conquering the willpower of many who typically abstain thanks to its moist yet crumbly consistency and light sweetness.  Choosing broadly from New Orleans Fish House's Dinner and \"Mardi Gras Happy Hour\" menus, an inspired take on Chicken & Waffles with spicy Wings in an oversized Ice Cream Cone arriving first, it was continuing the theme set by Gochujang/Kochujang that Frog Legs impressed thanks to Creole Glaze, juicy flesh easily slipping from Bone before the first course ended with a generous Wedge Salad and Sweet Corn Hushpuppies topped in tangy Creme Fraiche plus Emeril's own \"Spicy Cajun Caviar.\"  Built for celebrating, another table with 50th Birthday balloons having an excellent time beneath high ceilings and soft lighting while Pearl Jam played at modest volume, it was not long before Entrees and Sides flooded the table, Carne Asada Fries and their naked siblings each circulating quickly while Macaroni and Cheese topped by Lobster also made fast friends as a result of more Meat than the $22 price tag might suggest.  Happy to see Lagasse's legendary Redfish still executed faithfully, seasonal Squashes refreshing the palate between Pecan-crusted bites, suffice it to say that Beer Braised Pork Belly is probably not for those counting calories but thanks to slow roasting and robust Sauce the results are exemplary.  Finishing up housemade Pork Rinds, plus a big scoop of Rice teaming with Shrimp and Sausage, it was saving little space for Dessert that the table was once again filled, seasonal Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp tangy and rustic while individual Pecan Pies and steamy Bread & Butter Bread Pudding battled for top billing with the longtime title-holder for World's Best Banana Cream Pie.  ****1/2:  Although Sin City makes it easy to visit a new Restaurant 365 days per year, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House remains one of the Strip's most consistent eateries thanks to big flavors from Chefs Ken Lum and Sean Roe while GM Tyler Anderson leads an excellent FOH.",

They have a nice selection of appetizers, salads, and entrees.  The complimentary cornbread was fantastic!    I ended up ordering the poached shrimp with the a Cajun sauce and served with fried okra.  It was fantastic.  The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the okra was fried perfectly!  I also had the wedge salad, which was a nice selection of  gem lettuce, heirloom tomatoes, bacon and blue cheese.  I didn't partake, but they had a nice selection of desserts.  The gentleman sitting next to me had the banana cream pie and it looked amazing.  They offer a full bar.  The service was very friendly and attentive!  I highly recommend Emeril's.  BAM!",

I won't lie, I only came here because I saw pictures of the Banana Cream Pie and my sweet tooth demanded it.  I figured that I'll put up with whatever entree choice made sense to bide my time until the pie arrived (and it made me look like an adult by not just eating pie for dinner).  I am so glad I ordered the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Good grief!   It was friggin great!  The grits, the veggies, the whole set up was phenomenal.  Then cometh the dessert.   When it arrived, I was a touch concerned that the heavy ratio of banana over cream was going to hold it back.  However, it works.  It works really really well.  YKnow... as I eat it, I am realizing that the crust (of all things) may actually be the best part.  Hmmmm... should I order a second one?    I would be remiss not to mention the stellar service.   Den, Matt, and Robert were super attentive and friendly.  They really made it fun being here.  They answered questions, chatted, and helped make me feel like I was hanging out with friends. I hope the floor manager realizes how well they worked as a team and that great food paired with great service is exactly what will bring me back.   I look forward to exploring more of the menu the next time I come in.",

If you're looking for value and/or a food coma, you won't find it here.  Entrees ordered were as follows: gumbo, lobster roll, and the fish special of the day (some kind of pan seared crusted fish on a bed of herb pasta)  They were all so expensive. My lobster roll was a 4.5 inch soft dinner roll sliced open and packed with roughly 3 bites of lobster. I got played. Nowhere near those big bountiful stuffed lobster rolls you'd get in any normal establishment outside of Las Vegas. Was pretty disappointed.  Afterwards I galloped over to the slot machines, looking for a pick-me-up after such a lackluster meal, but ultimately threw away even more money. Never again, Emeril. Never again!",

    "text": "This is going to be so easy to review.Excellent!I have nothing but great things to say about Emeril's establishment.It was Top Notch from the server to the Crab cakes,to the Fantastic dinner.I have to say also for all this rolled into one,It was a hell of a Good Deal.  There was no wait,we were seated immediately.We were quickly greeted by our waiter.He had one of the best Mustaches I've ever seen,I was very envious of it.He was great! I had the house Lager and the Lady had the Moscato.They were both excellent and enjoyed throughout the whole meal.We also ordered the crab  cakes as an appetizer.It was well done with a hint of peppers with a creamy,crunchy texture.  We had no problem figuring out what to order,it was easy.Bye the way they have an lengthy menu of fish,Jambalaya,to oysters from blue points,to Hama hamas.So I ordered the Halibut and my lady ordered the oven roasted chicken.Wait TIL I describe both of these dishes. The Halibut had a light seared and cooked perfectly on top quinoa peppered relish.So Good,my mouth is still watering.So here is the kicker roasted chicken at a fishhouse.It was done perfectly served On creamy mashed potatoes with bacon fried Brussel sprouts.So you had to eat the Brussel sprout with the mashed potatoes which brought out the smokyness which was delectable.We both had bites of each other's plates and the combo with the Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were awesome.It went down Good.  If that wasn't enough that well groomed mustache waiter gave us Two sorbets which were off the hook.I was lucky that this establishment was down stairs from my hotel room but if your in Vegas you have to visit this  Gem.Emeril ,Congratulations You hit it out of the Park.",

    "text": "Meh, I have had better. Ive been to Delmonicos, Lagasse Stadium and now this one and I must admit they are all consistently boring and bland. The service was spectacular, but the food wasnt as flavorful or spicy as i would have hoped. Nothing jumped off the pages of the menu which the table agreed on so we went with server recommendations. The star of the night was the pecan crusted Rockfish and the Happy Hour menu.   The dining room is dated and so are the menu selections, which are very limited. In hindsight this concept of a restaurant would fit perfectly on a cruise ship, but in Vegas we require a bit more effort from restaurateurs to bother going back. The place felt like a holdover from the restaurant trends of a decade ago when Food Network chefs were in and they sold the restaurant. Now restaurants are more food forward, people need excitement, fresh flavors and more ambiance. This place was lacking in all categories. The concept was clearly on auto pilot.  Would I go back or send my friends and family  as a first choice? No. The service was amazing , amouse bouche was a nice touch and even the check was brought and closed timely, but the food was missing that Creole taste I grew up on and thats the ONLY differentiator.  For great seafood AND ambiance AND flavor I'll stick with Milos, Mastros and even Oyster Bar at Harrahs.",

Upon getting seated, one of the waitress went around and took the linen and placed it across our laps for us, and our waiter came to get our drink order. Hubby and I ended up sharing a 16 ounce steak and mashed potatoes. Just warning, it is pretty pricey! As we are waiting, they provided us with some corn bread. One member of our party went to the restroom and they instantly came and re-folded his linen to look nice.   Our meal came out and when they noticed another member was gone, they covered his dish until he came back to keep it warm. The steak was huge! I've been to other restaurants and when you order a steak it's always so small and not worth it. The portion was very generous and it was seasoned to perfection! Hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal and we may be back if we are in the area again!",

Have to go to these places because the colleagues I go with want great sea food.  There was only one vegetarian entree and it did not disappoint. It was the quinoa and grilled vegetable dish. I also had the whole roasted cauliflower. Please ensure at least 2-3 people like vegetable before you order the cauliflower.   The desserts (we got a platter) were excellent. The coffe drink with whiskey was excellent. All in all a good place with great service. My colleagues were swearing by the seafood but look at other reviews for those.",

All 45 of us headed on over to Emeril's New Orleans Fish House. We requested the large seating table in the rear of the restaurant and BAM just like that we turnt it up a NOTCH ya diggg!!!  Everyone ordered various dishes. Many of them chose the gumbo as an appetizer, and from the smiles and mmmmms it seemed to be a hit. Most of them ordered xtra rice with the gumbo...Since there wasn't a Rib-Eye on the menu (my go to steak) I went all in with the Beer Braised Short Rib....And Yelp family it was on hit, so tender sitting on the fluffiest bed of mashed potatoes with two mini carrots and a sauce so tasty...BAM!!! Next time ya in Vegas turn it up a NOTCH and enjoy the wonderful customer service and great food & drinks at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House",

We were onsite for a concert at the Gran Garden Arena and wanted to get a bite to eat. The Pub has a 45 minute wait. The Mexican place was packed. We headed over to Emeril's because I saw a number of open tables. Seemed like a casual dining room. We were seated right away.  I about soiled myself when I saw the prices. Of course I had to keep from flinching because I was with a guest and did not want to look like this was even an issue.  We wanted to eat light so we both had the Gumbo and the Baby Sweet Gem Wedge salad. The salad was amazing. I enjoyed every bite. So far, so good. Great service and 5 stars. Then we got the Gumbo.  The the delivery was part of the presentation. They bring the gumbo in a little pot and pour it into your bowl. Meh.  The gumbo was not horrible, it was just lackluster. Mine had three shrimp and the sausage was hard to find. Even the okra was hard to find. It was as if they scooped up the gumbo from the top of the pot without going deeper to get me some of the good stuff. The flavor did not blow me away. So I am deducting one star for the gumbo and I am not deducting 2 stars because I would need to try an entree or two to rate a more in-depth dining experience.",

Appetizers: I'm not a fan of oysters. I tried some from some of the appetizers our party and wasn't a fan. I just don't like oysters. So I am sure these are really good. Just not my thing. The garlic bread was good too.   Meal: ribeye steak. I should have gotten the filet or gumbo. Ribeye is decent but I like bone in ribeye steak. This was definitely really good though. Also the jambalaya is really good! I really should have tried the gumbo. I heard it's really good.   I should have tried some dessert.  Great place and I suggest trying them out if you are the MGM.   *oh I saw a guy fall asleep at the bar lol",

FIL remarked on the lack of True cajun/Southern dishes on the menu, at least other than the gumbo.  Overall I thought the options were good, but not great.  My FIL's meal was exactly the same meal I had at Todd's a couple weeks ago (seared fish, Israeli couscous, lemony sauce).  Mashed potatoes with blue crab served as the \"surf\" in the hubster's \"surf 'n turf,\" though, to be fair, that was a student's menu contribution through one of Emeril's charities.    We ordered the gumbo, which was delicious, and oysters to start.  Both were great and enjoyable.  My pork shank was tender and savory, and the red beans were creamy and delightful.  The shank was so large that I easily had enough to bring home to use for soup.  Overall it was a great meal and a good experience, but not necessarily the best I've ever had.  On second thought...the banana cream pie.  That WAS the best I've ever had.",

My dining companion started off with the beet salad which was okay followed by the pasta with mussels they were the smallest muscles I've seen and certainly were not reminiscent of a fine New Orleans dining establishment she also had the banana cream pie which again was great so the deserts are hitting the mark But the meal is not the menu is not a real authentic New Orleans menu and I looked at some of the plates of other people dying around us the trout looked good on the menu but in the presentation was good but the people in next to me saying that it was not good it was flavorless and full of Bones Emerald get it together next time I come back I hope you have a better experience",

So I got the cheapest thing I could find on the menu (I'm just plain-folk)...which was the pork chops (and I'll get to that in a minute). Then any sides you want, they are extra (generally $10-$12 per side). I understand it's a classier restaraunt than your average Cheesecake Factory or whatever....but Geez Louise!!  So about my porchops......okay, AMAZING!!! 16 OZ of pure meat! It was delicious and if I ever go again, this is what I'd get.  The mac n' cheese was very tasty too.

Everything came out really well it reminded me of McCormick and Schmicks. It was cooked to perfection. Also tried the Gumbo and it was spicy and good but I think the clam chowder is much better. They also make a great bloody mary, the spice was good but they came in short glasses.",

My friend & I shared the rib eye special and lobster bisque. The bisque was great, with lots of lobster taste, and some lobster chunks. The steak was aged 46 days, cooked medium rare, and served with sauteed vegetables & mashed potatoes. The steak was super tender, and flavourful. The mashed potatoes were quite good, but the vegetables were meh. The service was also weird.",

    "text": "Skip it.  Worse meal of our trip, in both food and service, a True disappointment as Emeril is one of our favorite Chef!  No comparison to Robuchen's or Rick Moonen's RM seafood or even Shibuya or Wolfgang's.  I had better food at the fish and chip stand in NYNY.  The crab trio tasting was less than memorable.  The king crab was ok, the rest meh. The oysters had so many loose shell shards in them, and they didn't give us any utensil to serve the condiments.  We are from boston, so maybe we are a little spoiled by proper lobster bisque.  But what we got was salty and less than tasteful.  It was made edible only after we asked for some cream fraiche.  The only thing that was somewhat decent was the grilled whole fish wife got, even if it was a bit overcooked.  My own entree was so unmemorable, I can't even remember what I had now.  Oh definitely skip the Creme Brulee or rather egg custard, we left ours after one spoon.  The service was terrible, from the hostesses to the waiter, felt like we were in a road side diner (actually that maybe an insult to some of the diners we had visited that had awesome and attentive service).  Amateur night is how I would describe it.  We had ordered a bottle of sparkling, which the server took away and did not bother to return and refill until end of our meal.  We had a show to rush to and when the waiter came to drop off the bill we even discussed it and he watched me put my card on the table.  But instead of picking it up, he turned around and left.  Ahmmm, really?   Truly a disappointment...",

Great menu, great food, great service, just top notch all the way around. I have noticed that the last three or four times that I have dined here that menu choices were not quite as interesting, and that the food quality dropped off. The last time the oysters were small, the gumbo was mediocre, and the portion small. Pricey for what you get. Sadly, I will not be back. I like Chef Emerils work, and have been to at least two of his other restaurants in Vegas. There are just too many other good choices to go back to mediocrity.",

    "text": "Well my dear sweet Emeril's. I have such a fond memory of eating here 10+ years ago for a special trip to Vegas with my then bf but now my hubs (poor bastard, right?). We finally made it back for a happy hour & it wasn't too happy, happy this time. The service is mostly why. We rolled up to a full bar & took the last two available seats & waited to be acknowledged with a happy hour menu. Then waited some more & some more. We watched as the bar staff mixed cocktails, cleared plates, cashed out tabs etc etc & finally had one member ask if we needed a menu? Um yeah after waiting 10 minutes for any acknowledgement we were a bitt fussy & said sure... why not? I think he got the hint & grabbed some waters too. Felt like a real movie star at this point. The service vastly improved from there Thank You Sweet BABY JESUS! But in their defense so did the bar clear out as it was getting close to the end of happy hour. We ordered the for lack of correct turn the ham & cheese flat bread off the regular menu & the Fried Crystal Shrimp from the happy hour menu. I really loved the pretzel bread which staved off my eating my hubs fingers while waiting for everything to happen. The shrimp were plump, crispy & had some awesome sauce. The flat bread was there in no time. The ingredients were very fresh & tasty however the flat bread was obviously re-heated because the edges were like rock. Very disappointed with that. I expect that at Olive Garden not Emeril's not at 5:45 p.m. The drinks were the saviors. We had the French 75 & Sammy's Rum Punch & both were excellent. So what did I learn? Stick to the happy hour menu at the bar & come with the idea I'm going to be waiting at happy hour for everything....",

    "text": "Ah yes, back in happier times this was the ex's and mines favorite Vegas restaurant. We came here so often we had our favorite waiter that always took great care of us.  Flash forward to even happier times. Happily divorced that is. I have family staying at The Signature condos connected by a looong walkway to the MGM where Emerils has been for 15(?) years. It's Super Bowl weekend and I figured most decent places would be maxed out. I called and successfully made rezeez for 5 about 10 days out.   The place has seen a remodel since I last visited and looks great. We were enthusiastically greeted and promptly seated exactly at our appointed time. My niece saw Stone Crab Claws and launched into an orgasmic squeal. \"OMG, I have to get those!\"  I replied, \"yeah we'll have to get one of those for the table.\"  She shot daggers my way...\"oh no way, I want an order to myself.\" Alrighty then.  Yep, you guessed it. Out of Stone Crab Claws. That'll teach her for been so greedy eh? So the meal didn't get off to the best start ever. We did order possibly the best ceviche I have ever had, and soon the claws that were not to be were soon forgotten. This ceviche made up of rock shrimp, fresh white fish, sliced avocados, and a generous helping of sliced jalapenos was a divine start to the meal.  Bonus pause: I spyed a great value for our wine: Dry Creek 08 Zin, $44. Deal. The wine list is extensive and there are more great buys to be found.  The food? Well I was that guy. The guy that ordered the worst choice of the table. I know this is a seafood place, but I was drawn to the braised pork shank. The red beans and mustard greens lent a nice southern authenticity to the meal, but most of the shank was just too dry. It was also lacking seasoning. Just kinda boring, until you got close to the massive bone. The meat nearest the bone was the definite payoff. Succulent and most satisfying, but one had to really work for the money shot. At $32 not a rip off by any means given the portion size, but I wish I  would have started at the bone and worked outwardly. Now you know.  My nephews filet was the envy of the night. Perfectly seasoned and oh so tender. Right up there with the best steak houses, although not a huge portion, but more than enough to satiate all but the most gluttonous diners.  Our sever seemed to be a novice, but the ultra pro floor manager regaled us with amusing asides and some anecdotes of Emerils history. The gent knows how to work the room.  If staying on this end of the strip, this is a great option. It is semi-high end, but not outrageously so for current Vegas standards. It is a very relaxing room where you'll never feel rushed. A definite departure for most of Vegas.",

Regardless, We continued with our dinner.  We had alcohol, appetizers, main courses, and the famous banana cream pie. The crab cakes were delicious and the seafood was very flaky in this dish. We ordered a couple of steaks With specialty steak sauces. It was very delicious. We also ordered Lamb and some seafood dishes and they were fantastic. The mix drinks are good. This place is open for lunch and dinner, but I strongly recommend paying attention to the happy hour. There is really good value here where you can get delicious food for very reasonable prices.  Please bring back the marinated steaks cooked on Cedar. This is my only complaint for this restaurant, but it is still very good.",

I started my dinner with the Shaved Fuji Apple & Butter Lettuce Salad. Yum! My favorite part of the meal! There really wasn't a whole lot of Butter Lettuce in the salad, but it did have an abundance of matchstick sliced Fuji Apples :) The salad was tossed with honey glazed almonds, celery leaves and shaved manchego cheese and dressed in a super light, citrusy, sweet and slightly sour dressing. I'm not a huge fan of celery, but the mild taste from the leaves was a nice refreshing accent.   For my main course I had the the Pan Roasted Flounder. It was a little...confusing? The fish was cooked perfectly, tender and flaky with a nice light \"crust\" from the sear. The part that I didn't love about the dish was the corn grits, it was a little too...gritty. It may have been the corn, but it felt a bit grainy when I was eating it. The Maine Lobster sauce that dressed the dish complemented it nicely. Creamy, but light with nice lobster chunks and wild mushrooms laid atop the flounder.   Service was very friendly and courteous. Given that the restaurant wasn't crowded, we were attended to promptly but not excessively.",

Usually I don't like eating at the celebrity chef restaurants because it's really over hyped and the food is overpriced and tasteless.    I had the Louisiana Crawfish Etouffee to start off with, it had good spice, flavor and a lot of crawfish in it. I could have just filled up in that and I would have been happy for the whole dinner.  My main course was the New Orleans Cedar Campfire Rib Eye Steak, which is one of the better steak that I have eaten in a restaurant. (I hold have asked them to sear the fat on the edge of the steak and it would have been perfect).  The only thing I didn't like was the veggies on the side that came with the steak, it's was all a bit soggy and mushy.  I would have given it a 5 stars but the veggies jut really wasn't that good.

    "text": "My boyfriend suggested we ring in the New Year with a little New Orleans noise. Last time I came here they were closed, so this time around I figured I'd be judicious and make a reservation with it being New Years and all. I didn't want to strike out again, so we nabbed a spot through Open Table.   My boyfriend was pretty psyched to try Emeril's Fish House. He believes New Orleans and Las Vegas (and NY) are among the top culinary capitals in the world - so we'd be getting a two-fer here!! We were a little surprised when we arrived and Emeril's wasn't flooded with people - we were expecting scores of people on New Years Eve. I guess many folks were jostling with the millions out on the LV Strip for the imminent countdown.   Service was fantastic! We were waited on by a trio of attentive, personable staff members that really made us feel so welcome and relaxed.  We started with the Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo and the Iceberg Wedge Salad. Great gumbo loaded with chicken, andouille sausage and vegetables in a strong-flavored broth.  We also ordered a few fine cocktails. I had the Expresso Martini to ensure I would be wide awake after all the dinner inhalation, er, I mean consumption, into 2012! My martini was smooth, aromatic with strong currents of Kahlua and expresso.   For our main courses, I had the BBQ Salmon with Andouille Sausage and Potato Hash, all topped with onion crisps. It was absolutely delicious! My big juicy salmon fillet was perfectly cooked with a nice slightly raw center.  It was classy with a little bit of sassy! I will definitely be partaking in this succulent salmon next time I come in. My boyfriend ordered the Seafood Etouffee. I don't know it is was his lofty expectations or his picky palette, but he wasn't blown away. I was hoping he'd be overcome with joy but such was not the case. He said it was good but he will try another selection next time.   Emeril's Fish House is a wonderful place to come dine, with fresh salivating seafood and steaks, exceptional service, impressive wine list, decadent cocktails and beautiful decor. Come in and experience New Orleans inspired creations with creative Emeril Lagasse spin.",

First off, I am a HUGE fan of Emeril's and will visit any restaurant he has in any city I'm visiting so when I made my first trip (and all subsequent visits to Vegas) I come here.  The service here is impeccable as it is at all his places. Anything I've ever tasted is so fresh and bursting with incredible flavors. The menu is always changing so this is what I remember having then (which some are avail at his other restaurants)  *Fresh Angel Hair Pasta with Smoked Mushrooms and House Made Tasso Cream Sauce: cooked perfectly al dente, creamy to mellow the bite of heat that comes with the tasso. WONDERFUL!  *Pecan Crusted Redfish w/ Shoestring Potatoes and Vegetables: LOVE this one! The fish was cooked to a juicy heavenly perfection and coated in a fantastic crust of pecans on a bed of grilled veggies and topped with crispy potato stings. They have different variations of this dish in a few of the other places. I had the Andouille Crusted Drum in New Orleans and that was awesome.  *Tasting menu: Always changing but I did a 6 or 7 course meal and the portions of each item were way bigger than expected. By the time I got to dessert, I had to take it with me cause I was going to explode! Def worth the $75 I believe I paid.  *Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: Ridiculous...in a very, VERY good way! Banana Crust drizzled w/caramel Sauce and topped w/ chocolate shavings in between thick layers of pudding and tons of slices of perfectly ripe bananas.  Do yourself a favor and go!!!!",

Had a couple of HH drinks, their mojito and margarita. Good stuff.  Got a couple of raw oysters. Not sure what I was thinking--should have ordered more. Very tasty.  Got the fried oysters also. What in the world? These guys were mutant sized, like the size of my hand and almost an inch thick in some places. So good though! Get this!  Also got the HH crab cakes. Not too impressed. Don't bother with this. I think it was the blue crab cakes. Tiny. Decent taste, obviously not lump crab so stick with the oysters.  Didn't have room or time for anything else. I had dinner to go to like in an hour. Vegas baby.",

It was great, cooked perfectly! My wife had the lobster and truffle dish which was so rich and tasty!! We concluded with the desert sampler: pecan pie, banana cream, and bread pudding.

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Emeril Lagasse & had wanted to dine here on other visits to Las Vegas for dinner and just wasn't able to. This time we ventured off our own hotel property to dine at Emeril's here at The MGM. We had a reservation for 500pm & were stuck in traffic on the strip and had to call and push back; not a problem; the staff was more than accommodating. If your coming from somewhere else, I highly recommend valet'ing your car; it's too far to walk from self parking and confusing. The MGM is also always packed and so large, it's a little hard to navigate. We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. Again, I don't recommend not having a reservation. You can get a reservation from Open Table via the Yelp app; makes it super easy! We started by telling the waiter that someone in our party had less than an hour for dinner; the waiter suggested ordering quickly and was accommodating to his needs. The rest of us wanted to relish our dinner and enjoy the experience. We started with frog legs ( off the current prix fixe menu and priced separately) and andouille sausage gumbo. Loved the frog legs with house made ranch for dipping. You get 5 nice sized legs; fried just right and good to share. The gumbo was a bit salty, in my opinion; maybe because I was taught in the dirty south by a southern mama how to make it just right?! My water glass and lemon never went empty; just out of surgery this was a dry trip to Las Vegas. My fellow diners, however, had Cosmo Martinis and a southern beer called, TurboDog. Impressive wine list to couple the display of wines encased. I wish :) My next course was the filet and broccolini. It was cooked to perfection and spice rubbed with a blend of Emeril's pepper and various other Cajun type spices. There was a wine and mushroom reduction that went well with the meat and the smashers I ordered on the side; yummy mashed Yukon gold potatoes that easily served 3-4! My dining mates had the fish pan roast and crab cake; both were amazing ! The crab cake off the appetizer menu is very generous and not at all , typical . It was loaded with nice, fresh lump crab. Yummy. My boyfriend ordered the cornbread , which is literally a pan full! Afterwards, 3 of us split the $10 banana cream pie ; as if we were not full enough! It was a good 4 inches tall and so rich and delicious. The Fiori espresso is perfect to end with ... I was impressed by the staff and food ; the decor is getting dated for a place and Chef so amazing ; it's very late 90's and the dining music was very 'disco' ; if it's supposed to be a fine dining experience with the price tag to match ... Change up the music to match the class :)",

She was the cute blonde that worked the night of the 21st haha. When we were seated, the host pulled out Cary's napkin and layed it on his lap. I wasn't angry but was like \"whoa..... you don't see that very often.\" haha. My manfriend was in awww.  For starters, I got the gumbo and Cary got the lobster base something.... Both were delish! The lobster whatever it was called was creamy and my gumbo was packed with flavassss. For our entrees I got the crawfish and shrimp thinging.... OK it was JUST like the gumbo and Cary got the bbq salmon which was amazing! THough my entree tasted just like my appetizer, I didn't mind much. I was super jealous of Cary's food because it was good! Maybe the next time when we come back, I shall get something way yummier. The service was also on point! Very attentative and super friendly.",

The drinks and  dinner menu are a bit pricey but worth it..I ordered the Purple Haze drink($4) = delicious. All together my bill came up to just under $40. The birthday girl ordered the tasting menu($50) and the other girl the seafood platter. The seafood platter was quite small and was almost $60.    **** If your in Vegas this is definitely a must go. You will enjoy it! Some of the best service i ever received!  9-27-12",

    "text": "Hmm.  So hard to rate this experience, because Las Vegas is as different from New Orleans as a desert is from a bayou... But I must say I was disappointed to find the decor in Emeril's Fish House to be so very...Vegas.  I was hoping to escape the MGM chaos for an evening of Big Easy jazz, and instead the restaurant was glitzy and glam, complete with glass walls so that the parade of attention-grabbing casino-walkers distracted from the experience all evening. That being said, I can comment only on the salad, dessert, and service, since my long drive through the desert found me filling up on snacks and fast food such that I was unable to partake in an entree on this particular Saturday night at Emeril's. The salad, a daily special with arugula, grilled mushrooms and asparagus, was subtle. A little TOO subtle. I should have passed on the black pepper, because it so overpowered the salad that I detected little other flavor.  It was mildly disappointing with what I've come to expect from Emeril. My server was of course, not the top-rate personality that you would find in NOLA, but I tried to keep an open mind since the cities are so very different.  My only complaint with the waitress (other than our very different tastes as evidenced by her recommendations which I wouldn't re-order), was that she became scarce in the latter half of my meal, and I had to wait too long to order dessert, and had to order my coffee from another server I happened to flag down. I reallllly wanted to try the huckleberry cobbler, but the waitress raved of their signature banana creme pie; so I went with the dessert trio of banana creme, pecan pie, and bread pudding.  The bread pudding was to die for.  Or kill for.  The pecan pie was great (but I haven't met too many of those that weren't), and the banana creme pie was somewhat dry in my opinion. I left half on my plate. I'll have to go again next time I'm in town to give it my full attention, complete with entree.  But with the stiff competition in Sin City...maybe not.",

The food was pretty good, the atmosphere was great, and it's located right in center of the MGM Hotel and Convention Center, a very convenient location. Our expectations were very high because of the stellar reputation Emeril has created but I must admit that we where a little disappointed.",

I never want to share even though last night it seemed like it wasn't as good as usual I still had plenty  of it...

We had a 11:30am reservation and was seated immediately....there were only 2 other tables being occupied at that time.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive as well as patient while we decided on what to chow down on.  We started with lobster bisque and gumbo, followed by sharing a wedge salad.  Lobster bisque did not look very appealing, but it was so tasty!  Gumbo had a nice kick to it and was very filling.  Their wedge salad didn't come with blue cheese, but ranch dressing instead...which was different.  I had the Seafood Etouffee and he had the Shrimp Po Boy as entrees.  We both enjoyed every bit.  They were quite large portions for lunch and we were stuffed, but had to split the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  CANNOT leave Emeril's without the Banana Cream Pie!!!  It is delicious!  We had a great meal here and it was a great start to our foodcation in Vegas!  We would definitely go back.",

It came with 5 shrimp, completely soaked and drowning in BBQ sauce, and the tiniest, most deformed biscuit you have ever seen. Maybe the diameter of a half dollar. Tiny. I also ordered the creole fries. Nothing was wrong with them...they're just nothing special at all. You could have fooled me and told me they were from Chili's and I would've believed you. For desert I had the bread pudding. Very delicious but since this is a gourmet place, it was very, very small and at $13. Yikes!  The staff is very, very sweet. They do a good job. Again, the food isn't bad, it's just nothing to rave about. I can see fancy under-eaters at this place who won't think twice about spending $32 on chicken and mashed potatoes. I kid you not. That is the price of the chicken dish.  Don't get me wrong, I will treat myself to an expensive meal every now and then but this place just doesn't wow or amaze me enough to return. Meh.",

I started with the wedge salad and we got the cornbread as an appetizer.    From there, I had the shrimp pasta that was very, very good.   My husband got his usual salmon but it did not disappoint!  We got our favorite dessert - banana cream pie!    Yummy, yummy, yummy!  We had two servers waiting on us - I think in the past we've had three but two were more than adequate.    I barely took a sip of water and my glass was refilled!    Finish with a plate and it's gone!  We had stopped by Emeril's the day before to check to see if they would accept an Open Table gift certificate and confirmed our reservation.    We were impressed that they had taken the time to note the check in our reservation and the waiter asked us about it when she brought our check.  Yes, Emeril's is a bit pricey but oh so worth it!",

    "text": "Sadly a Swing and a Miss...  We needed a snack before the True festivities of the evening started so walking thru the food mall at the MGM we only wanted appetizers and cocktails so we looked for a place that had seating for our small group with cocktails.  This was not out first choice but had enough people in it so it wasn't barren but still plenty of room.  We were seated and just kinda sat, I saw 2 servers keep looking at us while they were talking to others.  Finally one of the  2 came over for our drink orders.  Our friends after working, flying, dealing with airports/transportation and looking forward to a party were beyond ready.  So we sat finally our order was taken, after the order the drinks were delivered.  Shortly after the food was starting to be delivered.  This is when the problems started to occur.  The food was great like I said we only had a tasting of the menu.    Kumamoto oyster, a small, sweet, briny, deep small shelled and a firmer textured oyster.  Probably the last shot for this one in the season, they were tasty!  Emeril's barbecued shrimp large prawn shrimp shelled and marinated in a zesty bbq sauce.  Good stuff we enjoyed it!  The Grand De Finale' Emril 3 Cheese Bacon Mac and Cheese need I say more?!  No. I didn't think so, but I will OMG I would come back drive to the strip and park and walk for this small piece of peace in the world it is the zen of mac and cheese I really had to hold myself back I could have easily gotten out of control.  So the food was great, the delivery of the food was great but the whole thing was just a huge mix match during the whole process that confused me.  As I said in the beginning 2 waiters were watching us as they took others orders.  The same 2 that tag teamed us all night.  1 would take a drink order the other would bring 1 but forget the other drink order.  The other would come check and ask about drinks and we would say we ordered but one was forgot?  The other would come back with the other drink.  You know what you drink and one of our friend drinks his drink on the rocks as soon as he got it he started to smack his lips and lick I said \"oh oh whats up?\" him \"it's not my drink but I will drink it\"  So basically the miscommunication and utter disarray screwed it up.  No biggie not the end of the world, but for such a well known Chef this is one place that is not doing his reputation well.  He needs to come in and check things out and get his staff back on track his food undeniably good but if it is not made to his standards, served properly in this town of amazing restaurants and top chefs you will fail.",

    "text": "My feelings are mixed.  Though I can be known to make a few snarky comments about  TV chefs, I have had 2 great meals at Emeril's restaurants in the past.  My expectations were probably tainted by an experience over 10 years ago at Emeril's in MGM.  Back then it had a much more fine dining vibe to it and the food was delicious.  So I was a little disappointed to arrive and find some of the staff dressed casually, the noise level loud and music more appropriate for their happy hour/bar area than for a dining room.  For the salad course, my guest sampled the \"Baby Romaine Hearts Caesar\" while I had the \"Seasonal Apple & Butter Lettuce Salad\".  The romaine was in no way \"baby\" as the sections of lettuce are served whole and reach from one end of the plate to the next.  The dressing was mediocre.  I did inquire about the seasonal aspect of the apples in my salad as it is June now in Vegas.  Please don't call something seasonal when it so clearly isn't.  I was surprised to get equal parts apple and lettuce.  The apple appeared to have been kept in water before being plated and not drained properly as the whole dish had an overall watery aspect to it.  This drowned out the dressing making it rather bland.  For starters I had the Judith Point Calamari which was quite good.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the peppers and olives served alongside.  Now might be a good time to warn other potential diners that aside from the atmosphere being too casual to be considered fine dining, the portion sizes are as well.  This isn't necessarily a problem, just something I like to be aware of.  At a nicer restaurant I often enjoy getting several courses to sample a variety of food.  The portions here are large and not designed for that.  I ended up leaving half of each course uneaten.  My main course was by far the best.  I had the Grilled Lobster with Chile and Lime.  Again, it was cooked perfectly and I liked the light flavor of chili with it.  Dessert was the famous Banana Cream Pie.  It was OK, but the \"cream\" part was not, in fact, creamy.  They had manipulated this element to allow the pie to be cut into huge, towering wedges that would hold a beautiful, upright shape.  This means texture and flavor were sacrificed for appearance by adding quite a lot of starch or some other thickening element that kept it from having the creamy, pudding texture I normally would associate with this.  Each course was rather slow to come, but I am blame that on the kitchen, not the servers because each course was cleared promptly and water refills were plentiful.  I probably would not be back.  If I am spending close to $300 for 2 people to dine I prefer a more refined setting where the food is more consistent.  However, the lobster was so good I might be tempted to order just that at the bar to satisfy any upcoming shellfish cravings.",

So I can't really compare.   Made a reservation thru Open Table for 5pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away, as they had just opened. The ambiance is nice, loved the wine bottles displayed in the middle of the restaurant. Our server immediately came over and introduced himself and took our drink orders.   My eyes lit up when I saw the bread basket had pretzel bread in it, Joe's Stone Crab is my other spot that I usually fill up on their pretzel bread. Who knew this would be the highlight of my meal, actually my glass Sauvignon Blanc was a highlight. Anywho, this is what I ordered:  Cold Salmon Tartare-this was good, served with flat bread. Good flavor.  Horseradish blue shrimp with cous cous-this was a huge let down. The dish had no hint of horseradish at all, it was more of a BBQ taste than anything else. I believe it was Isreali cous cous, so they are a bit larger and have a slightly different texture than regular cous cous.   Banana Cream Pie-I can't really judge this as I guess I'm not a fan of banana cream pie, my guess is if this is your thing, it was probably delicious. I was trying to be different and order something I wouldn't normally order.  I don't see myself ever coming back here or recommending to anyone to try, even if it's RW.",

However, everything was sub-par.  The salad was ok - apple/walnut with lettuce - too much dressing and not enough flavor.  The app was really salty - shrimp with some sort of creole sauce BUT the worst part was the awful biscuit - hard and dry.  The main was salmon for me with andouille sauage.  The sausage was AWESOME but that salmon was dry and not good.  My colleagues had the steak and the restaurant over cooked most of them - well done steak should NOT be served esp for a fancy work event.  Lastly, the dessert - bread pudding.  It was not good - tasted like oatmeal with cinnamon sprinkles.  Overall, I was disappointed and would NOT go back there again.",

They sat us quickly and kindly even though we didn't have a reservation. The service was impeccable and I would recommend the young man that waited on us have some type of promotion. I ordered from the preset menu because it seemed the best bang for your buck, and I was pretty darn hungry. The corn bread.. Amazing! Sounds bizarre, but that corn bread was to die for. For my first course, I ordered the clam chowder and no regrets there! By far the best clam chowder I have ever had, and I live on the coast. The scallops were beautiful, but unfortunately I could taste that they weren't fresh, but perhaps that's because I'm accustomed to having them fresh off the boat. They were also bland, which is to be expected from a scallop, however, the bed of beans and corn they laid it on did nothing to help the taste of the plate. That was the only let down of the evening, and it cost them a star. It's Emeril's restaurant, I expected better. The banana cream pie was rich, too rich for how full I was by that point! It was also very tasty. Huge thanks to our server for bringing out the bread pudding because he had overheard that I had never tried that dessert before. I loved it, a new favorite to be sure. Overall a positive, happy experience. I'll be back next time I stay at the MGM.",

Since I was not too hungry so I just got the Apple & Lettuce salad and Clam Chowder.  The salad was good.  Very fresh.  The portion was ok but the soup was kinda small.  The soup was thick and creamy but not much clam.  My friend ordered Halibut.  $40 but the portion was very small.  I tried the fish and the taste was bland.  Not too much flavors.  Overall, this is a very standard restaurant in Vegas.......Come back??  Probably not because there are more better and good restaurants in Vegas!",

Great restaurants all over town offer a three course meal for 30 40 or $50 to benefit three square.  And we ended our national holiday with emerils. Emerils is located at the MGM Grand in a section called the district. I would've thought it was new but my friend said she had been coming here for years.  So Emeril gets extra points for having a $20 wine pairing. Not all of the restaurant week restaurants do this but Emeril did.  And they did not mind that I refuse to drink sweet wine and had to change out two of the three wines . However there are minus points for making the dessert on the restaurant week menu smaller than the regular dessert.  I started with the gumbo on the recommendation of a friend and it was really good . It was spicy it had a lot of shrimp and sausage . But the real star of the show was the Hawaiian butterfish. It was served exactly the way fish should be served in my opinion without skin and without bones. I am a True stickler on this. It was seared to perfection.  It was served with a spicy sauce but it was also served with an avocado cream sauce that really defies explanation. It was just so good. The fish was served on a bed of pickled veg and also with fresh cucumbers. The contrast was simply amazing.  When I'm in the mood to brave the strip I will definitely be back",

The burger looked pretty average. The salad was ordered without walnuts due to a noted allergy and came with walnuts anyway. For the money, this should have been a better experience.",

The seafood gumbo dish was okay.  Nothing spectacular..Your average gumbo.  The etouffe- I am probably spelling it wrong - was really awful.  33 bucks for this dish.  Bf didn't hate it like I did but really if this is supposed to be his signature dish -- it was an overpriced letdown!  The hyped banana pie -- lacked real flavor, way too much whipped cream and mushy crust.  Definitely not worth the don't-want-to-know how many calories.  The best thing?  The soft dinner rolls they serve before the meal!",

I'm not going to complain about the price, considering everything is overpriced in Vegas. The poor quality food stood on its own for a reason to be left dissatisfied. We had some shrimp and biscuit starter, that just looked graded when it came out. It looked like something out of Beetlejuice, with a murky macabre sauce squirted all over some overcooked shrimp.  The biscuit was pasty for some reason as well.   Next out, the drinks. I ordered some tropical drink, and it was room temperature and reminded me of a bloody marry. Didn't see that one coming.  My coworker ordered a Boulevardier and it had a cranberry a vodka vibe to it. Maybe Emeril is a wizard after all.   The entrees were a bit better but still underwhelming. The Pecan Encrusted fish was more of a fish fillet with some coarse and soggy nut crunch slapped on top. Encursted implies to me that theres some crunch and its at least somehow affixed to the base ingredient. But what I know? I'm not the Food Network A-Lister. Fortunately it was the first real meal of the trip, making every other meal seem fresh and delicious in comparison.",

The selection of fish and some seafood is great, but they always have Demonico's steaks as well, for those that don't prefer fish.  The service is impeccable; thank you Ivan and team.  The maitre d' checked on us more than once and our Sommelier Sean Morgan was outstanding.  We've been to Emeril's in New Orleans twice and I have to say we have always had amazing food and service. We were comped a couple of items (won't say what or why) but we didn't ever make a negative remark. Our server was just very observant and picked up on a small issue.  Our feeling was, if you are nice and engaging with the staff, you will get the best service.",

Instead we did two bottles of Rombauer - the Savignon Blanc (ok) and the Zinfandel (out of this world).  This was a 6 course meal with each course getting progressively larger and richer until the piled high unlimited dessert course at the end which was like eating right off of the dessert sample tray at Olive Garden (only not plastic).  Salad, potato tart, scallops, sea bass, and lamb were the other courses and all were excellent.  The chef's table doesn't apparently get a ton of traffic and they were eager to know how we found out about it.  And I honestly don't know...the wife booked it for 8 of us.

They also served us some cornbread as we waited. Cornbread was okay, just seemed left over. Not fluffy and kind of hard and heavy. We ate it all because our entrees took forever. The restaurant was pretty empty with maybe 5-6 tables. I don't understand why the meals took so long. They were great about filling our waters and tea frequently. I had the broiled oysters and wedges salad as my meal. The oysters are swimming in so much butter, it was more like a butter soup with some tiny oysters. I couldn't get past all the butter. I ate 2 and gave the other 2 to hubby. Wedge salad was okay, but not $15 great. I think it had gold beets in there which I did not care for. Hubby had lobster roll. He said the bread and the chips and coke slaw were good. Service was meh. Like I said, it seemed to take forever to get our entrees. We were there almost 2 hours for lunch! A server introduced herself at the beginning and also told us of about 2-3 other people that would be waiting on us. Still, entrees took a long time and then had to wait to get our check and then wait to pay. We did a lot of waiting in an empty restaurant. I would pass on this one and try Craft, which was perfect or Morimoto or there's an Italian and Asian place I would try.",

Service was a little slow - we had sat at the bar and there were only a few customers in the bar.  Oysters were decent, not the best I've had. We also had shrimp cocktail which was good, but only included 4 pieces. The sliders (beef and pork belly) were great! Drinks were decent too.  Nothing over the top just a standard meal of drinks and apps. Likely a better spot in Vegas to get oysters.",

The wait was so worth it. Going through the MGM on the way to emrils it was all that I could think of. Especially the banana cream pie! I mean if it's a dessert Wolfgang Puck dreams about, it must be good right?! We finally get to the restaurant and the hostess says the table isn't ready yet for our reservation! At this point its so close, yet so far away! Thirty minutes later they are finally ready for us, YaY! First at the table they give you a corn bread basket with butter. The corn bread was warm & toasty. Then with the butter, wow! We ordered the lunch steak and cheese a cheese burger. The steak was cooked perfectly and was tender. It was great! The burger was pretty good as well, but the steak was better! Now, for what I have been waiting for! The famous banana cream pie! If I could I would eat this every day! Its <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebomb.com&s=355187a2a784c6ee933e2e46feb84e4a2bbc84cde0736652fb6961a6a23327f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thebomb.com</a>! I even asked the waitress if they would ship a pie to NY! We all laughed but I was crying a little on the inside because I was serious! Another great place to try if you dont mind waiting!",

    "text": "Yeah, I'm not sure why I ate here either. It ended up being the closest place to sit down after my feet gave out from walking around the casino in high heels. I wish I would have picked a better (and cheaper) place to collapse.  We were told that we would have a team of three servers/bussers to attend to us. I didn't really see the point of this, seeing as there were only two of us. We got just as much attention as we would have with a single server in the end. (They need to lose those geeky aprons as well) I was excited to hear we would be getting a bread basket, but it ended up being cornbread (never understood the appeal of that crumbly stuff).   I did appreciate them asking if we were on any time constraints (if we were seeing a show at a certain time). This really sped the service up and our food arrived tout de suite. First impression: the lobster tail looked really underwhelming. The mashed potatoes on the plate and the lobster itself were overly salted. I could pretty much only taste salt. The tail meat was difficult to get out of the shell and ended up making a gross mess on the plate. It really didn't seem that fresh at all.  The mac and cheese made with fontina and pancetta was the best part. Nothing offensive about it. Considering how much I paid for that lobster, it should have been stellar and the highlight of my week. I really should have just eaten at the food court. SKIP, you can do better.",

    "text": "After a night of drinking, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House was tossed out as a suggestion for lunch.  Six zombies and a baby wandered into a restaurant with grumbly tummies and a hunger for seafood.  Sweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster( $16), Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce and seafood risotto (forgot the price but it was a lunch special so it changes daily anyways), and Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish ($37).  I honestly wasn't feeling too well so I stuck with sharing just a few items.    The Sweet Corn Bisque & Maine Lobster came out first.  It was everything I imagined it would be and it instantly made me feel loads better.  Sweet corn bisque that melds perfectly to delicious Maine lobster.  It had a couple chunks of asparagus and a cherry tomato.  The cherry tomato didn't offer much in terms to flavor to the soup so I'm thinking it was there for color and texture as were the asparagus.  It was smooth and creamy and was comfort in a bowl.  My main dish was the Pan Seared Fillet with hollandaise sauce on top of a seafood risotto.  After my disappointing ribeye at Aria, I was hoping this would hit the spot.  It did not.  The fillet was cooked perfectly but there was no seasoning and not even a nice char.  I pushed my plate away after eating a couple slices of the fillet and most of my risotto.  That was some really excellent risotto and the hollandaise was balanced beautifully.  I also got to eat a good bit of the Pecan Crusted Texas Redfish (Anson Mills Pepperjack Cheese Grits, Garden Vegetable Ratatouille with Creole Meuniere Sauce).  The fish was amazing and flaky and those grits made my skirt flip.  While the garden vegetable ratatouille was fresh and flavorful, I could have done without this and had more cheese grits.  Hey, we're talking cheese grits here.  Can you blame a girl?  Service was excellent and everything was served with perfect timing and precision.  It's a beautiful restaurant and it wasn't too busy on a Saturday noon.  It's definitely worth taking a $10 Lyft from Bellagio to MGM for!",

The wine selection is very nice., I don't remember what we had but they were all delicious.

They were both pretty good but there are plenty of Po' Boys in San Francisco that taste just the same and cost less. I do appreciate the fact that they didn't skimp on the shrimp and oysters in the Po' Boys. The pre-meal bread rolls were pretty damn good though.   $106 for 5 people and 5 entrees. Not a bad deal at all. But it wouldn't be a place that I'd say is a must eat.",

    "text": "I'm typically not a fan of huge chains, but while taking a family friend to Vegas, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm hesitant because the quality in both the food and service is never as good as the original.  It's natural that as you grow, you have less and less control.  Emeril's fits exactly into that category-- the food was solid, but the service was a bit spotty.    I dined with a family friend of mine who had just returned from a trip to Alaska. He loved the food, saying that the seafood was better prepared than what he had while on his trip.  We had a show to see, so they were kind enough to fastrack our meal so we could enjoy both dinner and a show.  While the food was memorable, the servers and wait staff could improve their manners. We sat next to one of the cash registers, where some of the servers would congregate. Nothing speaks of fine dining, then having a bunch of servers talk about their exploits and \"getting ass.\"  If only we could have taken the meal to go, or if only they had given us Bose server-cancelling phones, it would've been a perfect experience!",

For instance, when you order clam chowder, they bring out a mini pot to serve it to you in another bowl. There is about enough clam chowder in the bowl to serve an infant mouse.   The Steak Sandwhich on a roll is cold and really not worth it.   I also had the steak on a board which really screams, just put it on a plate and give it to me.   The reason I come here is one reason. The Banana Creme Pie. Let's get one thing straight. I have no sweet tooth whatsoever. I could care less if I ever ate chocolate again. This thing is simply amazing. The graham cracker crust is the key to what makes this thing brilliant.   If I were you, I would go to Emeril's Delmonico's instead. Pretentious, but better menu options. And of course you can still get a BCP.",

We were seated quickly. However, all three waiters forgot to bring a drink menu.  I had to ask several times. By the time I got the wine list, our dinner was served along with our appetizers. Terrible timing. One of the waiters responded to my surprise at the timing by saying... Well it's better to get food early than late.  I thought that the response was rude and seems to indicate an issue with dinner timing.  We had gotten a 25% off dinner coupon so I felt like we were being rushed and/or not getting their best service.  Now, the food. We got their house specialty-the salmon. It was cooked well but the dish was mediocre. If I'm paying almost 40 for a dish, I want it to be something I can't make at home. My husband got the pork chop. He thought it was good, but also not special. For the price I was very surprised at the average dishes although the portion size was good.  The restaurant was very well designed, but I was disappointed with our experience and will not go back or recommend this place.",

First of all the soups were great (clam chowder and lobster bisque), however my Shaved Fuji Apple & Butter Lettuce was drenched in a not so pleasing dressing and there was too much apple to lettuce.  I then ordered the sea bass and it was tasteless.  It had a pesto sauce which I thought would give it a nice zing but the pesto was either old or not prepared well.  It did not add to the dish.  My husband had the Cedar plank camp fire rib eye and it was a huge portion but the sauce took away from the taste of the meat.  The country smashed potatoes was the only redeeming featured item. We left the restaurant feeling that we way had way too much salt and the cost of the meal was exorbitant based on the quality of the meal.",

Plan B - one door down is Emeril's.  No wait and we were promptly seated.  Never thought I will be eating at Emeril's in Vegas but I need to eat!

The fish was a tad oversalted - not unpleasantly salty but the fish didn't really need it. Mahi is pretty much a perfect creation as it is, and there's no need to do much to it.The rest of the entree was absolutely fantastic though - I loved loved loved the orzo and mushrooms and the mussels we ordered were tasty too.  One slight annoyance was that they wouldn't split the entrees for us so we had to do it ourselves. I know that may not be the \"classiest\" thing to do at a white-tablecloth restaurant, but we each wanted to try more than one thing and we didn't want to spend 100 bucks on lunch alone. It seemed like an easy enough request to accommodate but whatever.   As others have mentioned, the best part of the meal by far was the banana cream pie! If you go, you must try it. It was completely decadent without being too heavy or too sweet. The pie alone is worth the trip.",

We were told to call a few days ahead when we returned and they would make it for us.  Which we did but what we got the next time was just standard lobster bisque nothing like what we had the first time.   The food was still good but the service is a bit over the top.  However the last time we went there was hardly anyone there and the food was not as good.  We went at lunch and what really struck me as odd was the cheap rols they were serving.  These rolls where the same sweet ones you get at any discount store and frankly even I wont buy them.  I was rather insutling when the waiter served them with his silver tongs.   Cheap rolls are cheap rolls no matter how you serve them.  The rest of the food was good but not as good and I honestly do not know if the prices are worth a repeat.

The people who are complaining about it being expensive should have a reality check because in my opinion it is worth every penny.  If you want a cheaper seafood diner then you should head to red lobster or long john silver but you will get some crap food there.   I had the grilled octopus starter (amaze balls) and the shellfish pasta which was superb.  The shellfish was top notch....the shrimp in the dish were huge and fresh...I have had shrimp that were caught off the boat I was eating them on and the ones in this dish were just as good.   My dinner companion had the halibut and collard greens...she was as equally happy with her dish as I was.   The service was just as fantastic as the food!    Ignore any of the negative reviews and try it for yourself.  If you are a cheapskate or think the olive garden is fine dinning then I wouldn't waste your time because there is no way you would appreciate this food.",

Loved the hot little pre-dinner pretzel rolls they served here.  We had 2 people waiting on us, and they could not have been nicer or more attentive.  The only downside was and EXTREMELY rude and loud table directly across from us.  Not the restaurant's fault of course, but it did make our experience a little less than perfect.  As far as the food goes, we will definitely be back.  The salmon was done perfectly - I asked for mine to be cooked on the drier side.  There was just enough barbecue sauce - not too overpowering.  Dessert was beignets with chcolate orange sauce - didnt like the dipping sauce, but that's just me.  Wonderful restaurant!",

I went a few months ago and did not have the fun/culinary experience that I usually have. The waiter seemed stressed and hurried. The food was another story: The steak was tough and chewy - I couldn't eat it and when he saw that I didn't eat it - he didn't offer to get me something else? So I didn't push it. I just wanted to leave. Another dish that we ordered tasted funny and the presentation was all over the place (all four of us voted on this) and there you have it - we couldn't get out of there fast enough. This used to be my favorite place to go and experience such amazing food and presentation. I know that if Emeril was at this restaurant-none of these things would have happened. So sad I have to say goodbye to one of my Las Vegas traditions.",

With many choices I decided on Emeril's. What a mistake.  When dinning alone, I prefer to eat at the bar. I have found throughout my travels that if good food and service is provided at the bar you've truly found an outstanding establishment, or in this case, not.  First off, I wasn't offered a wine list. With a very large wine room they don't have a sommelier. When I asked the bartender to pair wines with my meal all he could do was ask \"do you want white or red?\"  I started with crab cakes which were so over seasoned that I couldn't tell if it was crab or white fish. Next was Gumbo. That is good but I think the shrimp had been frozen. Main course was Blacken Wild Sea Bass that was over cook served with a vegetable melody swimming in worchestier sauce. I wasn't offered a dessert menu.    Any other restaurant would ask if there was a problem when they clear the plate away and find most of the food had not been eaten. Not here as they just don't care. $85 later and I left The Strip vowing never to return again.",

    "text": "NOT A FAN.  I only refrained from giving one-star because the Ahi Tuna is probably one of the prettiest dishes I've seen (take a look at my pic NOW haha)  Luckily I didn't go in super high expectations, but I can't imagine this standing up to many of the other restaurants within 20 feet walking distance.  We ordered the Crusted Ahi Tuna and the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Appearance was awesome!  The Ahi Tuna's taste was alright, and I just didn't enjoy the Redfish.  I understand that tastes/types of food differ and this many not have been the spot for me, but my complaints come from the service.  Problem number one is that we had two waiters through the night, which is already confusing.  Maybe they got their game plan confused:  They each asked us \"how we were doing\" once during dinner.  They asked within a minute of each other, immediately after we received food and before we started eating.  Awesome.  Problem number two is possibly related to how young I look (or maybe I'm looking into it too much).  The waiter dropped off the menu when he seated us.  After our meal he didn't ask if we wanted dessert and dropped off our check.  Now, this normally wouldn't bother me too much.  I started getting pissed when our same waiter (the one that gave us our menu) seated an older couple right next to us.  He proceeded to give a detailed explanation of their specialty dishes, recommendations, as well as explaining the option of a pricey prix-fixe tasting menu.  I'm not saying I would have ordered differently if I did get the speel, but still....give it regardless!  Also, I was peeking around at all the desserts passing by -drool-...but not like we had the opportunity to order anyways.  I felt pretty neglected (we all just need some love right?) especially for a restaurant that wasn't even half-full.  It's one of the only instances that I've walked out and complained directly to the host.  He seemed very sincere which was nice...but didn't offer for us to give them another chance, if you know what i mean ;)",

It was anything but hot. It was barely warm. The dish was just ok. Nothing to write home about...For dinner, my husband ordered the king salmon grilled and I ordered the fish stew. My stew was pretty tasty. However the jambalaya was mushy. His king salmon was very bland. For the price, I don't see myself going back.

The servers were friendly, attentive, and informative.  For the appetizer, we tried the raw oysters.  I can't remember which ones we had exactly, but it was the one the waiter had said was plumper.  I have to say that the raw oysters were so delicious.  It was clean tasting and almost refreshing.  I wish there was more than four on the plate, because i wanted to keep eating.  For the entree, my friend and I shared two dishes.  We got the BBQ Salmon and the Pan-Roasted Gulf Flounder.  Both were very well cooked.  The salmon had bolder flavors, while the flounder was milder in flavor, but had a richer sauce.  It was almost too rich for me.  We also order a side of the Asparagus and Roasted Paquillo Peppers with Goat Cheese, which was perfectly cooked.  While I enjoyed all the things we order, none of it really stood out to me as super spectacular.  I guess I had high expectations for Emeril Lagasse to wow me, and he sort of didn't.  The best thing that night were the two raw oysters I ate.    Perhaps we didn't choose the best dishes or perhaps this was not a restaurant that pushed flavors to the limit.  I'm not sure.  I would still recommend this restaurant though if you are looking for a solid menu to impress a date.",

My friends are about 30, so I'm pretty sure she didn't mistake us for underage. Despite that, the food was excellent. Heirloom tomato and mozzarella was delicious!! The tomatoes were just sooooo good! Had the pork chop, very good flavor, really enjoyed the sides.  For dessert we had a pecan chocolate tart thing... it's very chocolatey (and not as much like pecan pie as expected), but it was great! Wine list is insanely big.  They also have fun cocktails like a \"bam\" drop which was good. Happy hour at the bar has amazing deals! We enjoyed a drink there before dinner.

    "text": "This trip marked our second time eating here.  Similar to our first experience, the food was fantastic and service was exceptional.  This time, we came with another couple friend and shared our entrees so that we could try a variety of dishes they had.  During our 2nd visit, we decided to order frog legs; it was the first time all four of us tried frog legs.  Honestly, I had no expectations on this dish at that time since I wasn't feeling well.  When I first saw it, I thought it was shrimp tempura and it took a while to figure out that it was actually frog legs.  It tasted pretty yummy and the meat was very tender!  During our meal, I noticed that the staff changed out our used utensils and plates after each \"course\" we ate.  They were also very kind and observant; they gave us extra small plates since they seemed to know that we were sharing our food.  Also, the staff provided us with a complementary blackberry-something sorbet to help celebrate my husband's birthday!  It was extremely nice of them!  Plus, it was soooooo good!!!!  A perfect finish to our lunch meal!  Korean Elvis' turn: Yes, the food and service was superb as was the last time we dined here two years earlier. Also yes, the frog legs were my choice since I wanted the food that might to be authentically Cajun.   The food was as delicious as before. We got the gumbo, a steak dish, a fish dish, and yes; the frog legs. In my history eating at celebrity chefs' restaurants were always hit or miss. For example, eating at Mario Batali's Carnevino was awesome while Wolfgang Puck's restaurants in Hawaii was a total waste of money and expectations. However, this place is up there in all of the restaurants I have been to in Vegas.   As the wife had said, they changed our utensils before every course. This is called pre-bussing and I have only seen it done in less than a handful of restaurants in Hawaii: Morton's among a few others. This shows the level of service which is met in these restaurants. We went there the day of my birthday, and the restaurant provided a sorbet to commemorate! That was going above and beyond what I expected in this place!  If you're looking for great service that doesn't break the Vegas budget too much with great Cajun food, I wholeheartedly suggest this eatery in the MGM. Happy yelping everyone!",

Honestly, this was one notch up from the Cheesecake Factory, not alongside Brennan's, etc. And, at $200 for three people (our bill) it needs to be better. If the bill was $125 I would have given in a 5-star. But, if you are going to charge a premium, we better leave telling stories about how good it was.   And, again, the food was darn good, just not best we've ever had. Not even close, in fact. The three of us travel more than often for work and have eat much, much better, for far, far less.   The apps, were pretty good. The Cajun BBQ Shrimp was tasty and the sauce it came in was good. The calamari wasn't tender, wasn't greasy and we demolished it. In fact, both were fairly priced.   Two of us went with the Pecan crusted redfish, which was well done. Is it the best redfish I've ever had? Not even close, but it was good and the fixings came in strong, too. I've had much better redfish (for half the price) on the Gulf Coast, however, but we also need to take into account that this is Vegas and it costs a bundle for rent here. Still, the flavor could have been a notch higher.   I personally didn't eat the pork chops. A friend did. He was thrilled with the portions and flavor, but mentioned it was a 3.5 not a 5. (And, he's had that dish at similar priced spots across the US.   The biggest letdown came with dessert. I ordered the pecan pie, which I'm a huge fan of and the pecan pie I've had at Pappadaux (a lower priced chain) blew this away. The crust was great, but the pie tasted like it was just thawed.",

They did not care that we shared the tasting menu which is amazing!!! Sooooo many places will not allow this but they do. It was perfect. The first thing we got was the balsamic salad. Then the BBQ shrimp (the best thing ever is this shrimp dish), then it was the main dish the short rib. Now the short rib was ok for me, but I'm not a huge short rib fan. Everyone else raved about the rib. So it was just me. Get extra mashed potato because those things are heaven on a fork. I almost ate a whole side because it was so creamy and good. Then the last was banana cream pie. Amazing amazing amazing pie. Overall I will go back to this place every time just for the pie and great tasting menu",

I wasn't planning on drinking, but I saw they had my favorite drink, Pimm's cup, on their happy hour menu! If you've never had a Pimm's cup, it's a very refreshing and very British drink with muddled cucumbers, ginger ale and a gin-type base. Other than drinks we shared oysters, soft pretzel sticks and fried shrimp. I tried to order calamari off the regular appetizer menu, but the bartender said they weren't serving it yet, which is weird because there were customers in the dining room. Then another guy at the bar ordered a whole meal off the regular menu! In any case, I tried again with dessert and was more successful. The taste of New Orleans dessert plate included a mini pecan pie, bread pudding and banana cream pie. All three were amazing and satisfied my sweet tooth.  I definitely recommend Emeril's for happy hour if you're at the MGM.",

The restaurant was not very full but the atmosphere was fun and the huge wine racks were fun to look at.   I started with the green tea fizz cocktail and it was so light and refreshing, although it was a little bitter. Between the five of us we tried a lot of different things. I had the barbecue salmon and it was absolutely my favorite meal of the night. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was probably the best I've ever had. It paired great with the potatoes and sausage. The calamari was also top notch, you could tell his fresh it was because the finished product was so light and fluffy! The shrimp and grits meal was also good! The guys ordered the fishermans stew, they liked it but we're disappointed by the size. It wasn't worth the price so I would skip that meal. All in all it was a great experience!  Another notable factor, our waiter Rocco! He was outstanding and very personable!",

    "text": "Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is located in the MGM.  Came here with my mom and sister during a \"Girls Weekend Vegas trip.\" We settled on Emeril's out of convenience and curiosity. We were staying at the MGM and didn't want the hassle of waiting in line to cab it to and from another hotel and this was the first time any of us would be eating at an \"Emerial\" restaurant.  I made same day reservations, on a Saturday, without any issue.  Our reservation was at 9pm. Once seated and settled, we asked our server about entree recommendations. The items that our server recommended, in the exact order: 1) \"Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak--16 ounce Black Angus Ribeye, Warm Remoulade Sauce, Emeril's Worcestershire and Country Smashed Potatoes,\"  2) \"Cider Brined Double Cut Pork Chop--Rosemary & Chive Potato Puree, Savoy Cabbage and Natural Reduction,\" 3) \"Emeril's Barbecued Atlantic Salmon--House Made Andouille Pork Sausage, Brabant Potato Hash, Sweet Barbecue Sauce and Crispy Onion Crust\" and 4) the Diver Scallops. I was surprised to hear that the steak and pork chop were among his recommendations since this was a seafood restaurant.  OUR ORDER: **Sides: Andouille Sausage Jambalaya & Port Wine & Foie Gras Sauteed Wild Mushrooms **Entrees: The Halibut for me; the Diver Scallops for my mom; and the Cedar Camp Fire Plank Steak for my sister **Dessert: the Banana Cream Pie  The sides were very good, especially the Wild Mushrooms. It was very rich, probably due to the foie gras. Between the 3 of us, there were leftovers because after while the richness of it all was too much.  My halibut looked good as it was presented over a bed of beans, small veggies, and nuts mixed in a red tomato type sauce. However it was a bit salty and overcooked. My mom's scallops were very good, 4 large ones on a plate along with asparagus and small side of the same wild mushrooms.  My sister's steak was surprisingly very good, which made me understand our sever's recommendation. Cooked well, seasoned well, with a combo of textures from the steak to the mashed potatoes.    Now the best thing out of the entire meal was dessert. Again we asked our server for his recommendation and he couldn't stop raving about the banana cream pie. Now I'm not a fan of banana flavored bread, cakes, cupcakes, pudding, including pie. However, because he was spot on about the steak I decided to take a leap of faith and get on board with my mom and sister who both wanted the banana cream pie.  The pie came and went...we devoured all of it. Light, fluffy, with a hint of banana it wasn't as bad as I had imagined it to be. I'd go so far as to say this was the best banana cream pie I've ever had...definitely made with quality ingredients.   So overall, my 1st time at an \"Emeril\" restaurant was ok. The side of wild mushrooms; the cedar plank steak; and the lovely banana cream pie were the food highlights of the meal. I doubt I'd come back if it were up to me, but I'm definitely glad I tried it.",

    "text": "We ended fall restaurant week 2014 at Emerils. We did the Open table reservations once again and got email updates to confirm but never a phone call from restaurant to confirm. We arrived early which was not an issue for staff and were seated right away. I do have to say I was hoping for a more quiet setting it is open concept for most part with the bar at the front without a partition from dining area so crowd noise was sufficient enough to not allow an intimate conversation.  First course. Started with a Seafood & Andouille pork sausage with shrimp and steamed rice. Jut what a Gumbo should be, thick and flavorful. The dish has that cajun bite that adds just enough kick but not to make you scream for a glass of water. Josie had the Tuscan Kale Salad with Raisin Vinaigrette, toasted Pecans and Queso Mahon Cheese. She stated kale was crisp and fresh vinaigrette had a good flavor no long aftertaste.   Second course. Josie had the seared scallops with Bacon, corn summer vegetable succotash with a herb caper butter sauce. I had a bite of these and they were melt in your mouth good. perfectly cooked and the succotash was flavorful. I had Fisheman's stew. Littleneck Clams, Mussels and Shrimp. I was not impressed with the dish and was hoping for more sauce. Had a crustini for dipping but with the lack of sauce it seemed pointless. I know it is a stew but the overabundance of stewed tomatoes took away from the overall taste.  Dessert. Bread and butter pudding and Banana Cream Pie. The bread pudding has this flavor you want, a buttery melt in your mouth without the mush taste that some bread puddings offer. Small Banana cream pie square with whipped topping, chocolate shavings and caramel sauce. Great ending dessert adding a touch of soft flavor after the spices we had in the meal itself.  Overall a good dinner. Not sure if I will be back. They did offer a wine tasting for 20 dollars that sounded nice if we had the fortitude for that on this evening. 3 stars for tonight. Ambiance was not great and noise was loud. I know it is a prix fix menu but I have seen better efforts on restaurant week that would make me want to return and try a full menu pairing. Again I don't get the $4.50 a glass for a diet drink. Hope someone can tell me why this is a restaurant pricing standard in Vegas. Again my glass was never empty, bonus there. Staff was attentive and present when needed. Maybe I have high hopes for a restaurant put together by a star like Emeril. So 2 seafood places this restaurant week and RM Seafood would be the winner.",

This fish itself was the highlight of the meal, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Again, though, the sauce was bland, its yellow color the only way I could tell it was saffron.  Also, the fettucine was stuck together.  Not what I would expect from a restaurant at this level.  Service was good, but I wouldn't go back again.",

More like a NY trendy place.  The service was OK - the waiter gave the next table some complimentary appetizier, but not for me.  It was reasonably prices for some fine dining.  I forgot what kind of fish I had, but it was moist and delicious.  I did order the famous banana cream pie.  It was good: creamy, light, and not too sweet.  But I wasn't blown away by it.",

He told me it was straight lychee flavored vodka!  Yikes! Had I known that...I wouldve gotten something more wussy than a lychee martini.  ironic huh!",

I asked the waiter what kind it was and they didn't know but it came from Colorado.  Going to get that particular breed and raise it myself it was that good.",

My party opted for individual orders, as opposed to pre-made course meals. The clam chowder is amazing, thick, creamy and full of clams, not to mention HUGE! The blue crab meat spread is also very delicious. Both the sea bass and salmon entrees are flavorful and fill you up! The chicken comes in a large portion and is pretty good too. The only order that was a little too tiny was the bacon crusted texas rock fish. A party of 4 will easily spend $200 here, but as I said before- if you're willing to drop the cash, drop it on over here!",

    "text": "Given that Emeril is the king of the Food Network, I naturally had high expectations of this place.  I was somewhat disappointed... there was really nothing all that memorable about this meal.  Everything was mediocre to slightly better than average... that goes for not only the food, but also the decor and the service.  The best item we ordered was the steak, though \"medium\" was more close to \"rare\", which came with a big side of some of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've had.  Beware that most of the items on the menu are quite heavy.  The spicy seafood pasta dish was a slightly more sophisticated version of a jambalaya but it did have a nice flavor to it with a good little kick.  The most disappointing dish at this \"Fish House\" was the grouper we ordered.  The fish was overcooked and dry and if it weren't for the cream sauce they drenched the fish in, it really had very little taste.  The apple cobbler dessert was also a disappointment, maybe it would've tasted a bit better if it had been served warm.  Like most of the dishes we ordered, I got sick of this after a few bites.  For the price you'll be paying, you're best off going to many other better restaurants in Las Vegas.    And please, I plead everyone out there, let's stop with the use of \"bam\".  Our cute waiter was fine up until that point.",

We had no wait for our reservation, and for the MGM which is such a zoo, that was impressive.  The problem is that the food is just not excellent, and it just doesn't taste like the dishes you're used to cooking if you're a fan of Emeril.  Perhaps we ordered poorly, but of the four things that we tried, the beet salad was the best--that's not saying too much for a restaurant that specializes in seafood.  The BBQ Shrimp is supposed to be a specialty of the restaurant--think peanut butter BBQ on slightly tough shrimp, and you get the idea--perhaps other people like that, but it's not my taste.  Keep looking if you're after a special restaurant while in Vegas.",

The jambalaya was better, but kind of dry and even though it was a side it could have been an entree with such a large portion.

We ordered the menu set for both my husband and me, with the wine pairing for him, and a delicious mojito for me. I don't know what the bartender did different with the mojito, but it was the best I ever had, and even the server told me that it was one of the best! It was a bit small, but worth every penny. We started off with fried rock shrimp and picked carrots and radish (kind of an asian flavor to it) in a lettuce cup with a caviar vinaigarette. The rock shrimp was seasoned just right, and I just picked up the lettuce cup and ate the whole thing like a wrap. Both the hubby and I loved it.  Then we had a broiled oyster that was not so good. It was cooked with a creamy sauce with onions, the sauce was good, but I hit a chunk of shell on my first bite, and that ruined it for me.  The pan cooked salmon on a black-eyed peas/yams salad was okay. The salmon was a little tough, but the crunchy salad had an interesting texture and tangy flavor to it that added a few points to the fish. The black cod with mixed mushrooms and a wheat-berry vegetable melange was awesome. The mixed mushrooms were cooked together in a sherry or wine sauce, yet retained their individual flavors. The cod was tender and went with the sides quite well. The filet was juicy but the shrimp on top was a little over-seasoned. The bleu cheese was a nice touch, but you have to be careful to taste just a teensy bit with the food, or it easily overpowers the meat. The dessert, bread pudding with warm cream and whisky reduction was heaven. When I told the server the bread pudding was awesome, he smiled and confessed that it was his favorite of all times.  The husband liked the wine pairing, though most of it were white wines (for the seafood), and he's not a fan of white wines.",

    "text": "We were starving for lunch and couldn't pick a place and ended up walking right past this place and ducked in.  We were in New Orleans two months ago and missed going to Emeril's there so we figured this was a perfect chance to make up for that indiscretion.    The atmosphere was awesome - of course it was not NOLA at all, but the interior was just gorgeous.   The pace of the service was a *tinge* slow, but I think it might have been intentional so you could relax and enjoy your food, not get it as quick as possible.  The waitstaff and hostesses were super, super nice.  The lighting was nice and we definitely enjoyed being there and the conversation.  Unfortunately, the food was kinda meh.  I got a shrimp po boy, and honestly, the one I got at the little dive bar right by the hotel in NOLA was WAY WAY better and about 1/3 the price.  Joel got fish tacos - and while what he got was tasty - it could barely be called a taco - it was more like a fish quesadilla without any cheese.  It wasn't *bad* at all.  It just didn't blow me away as I expected.  I definitely want to give the one in NOLA a chance, but with so many other places in Vegas to eat, I don't think I'll be getting back here any time soon.",

Of course they are never around to manage quality control as they are busy doing their shows on Food Network and endorsing overpriced merchandise.  Let's just say I don't remember what I ordered but do remember that it was fish (mahi mahi I think) and it was very dry and the sides were overcooked and dull in color. The service was polite and quick. More than anything, I remember the fun conversation and boisterous laughs I had with my friends and family.",

I ordered the gumbo, a crab melt type appetizer, and the banana cream pie. The gumbo was average, I've had much better before at other places. The crab melt appetizer was disgusting- I ordered it based on the recommendation of the waitress. It is crab in some mayonnaise like sauce that you are supposed to spread on these crostinis that they give you. The sauce didn't taste very good- too sweet- and the crab tasted fishy.   Overall, the only redeeming thing about the meal was the famous banana cream pie. I overheard the waitress telling other people that some people go here just to have that alone. I was thinking- what a great idea- that is what I should have done! So keep it in mind.",

They are some of the most courteous servers that I've ever encountered.   A group of 4 friends and I during our first trip to Vegas, made this our grand dinner location and that it was. From the amazing appetizers to our fabulous entrees of succulent red fish, and scrumptious steaks, to mouth water shrimp and scallops, everything was perfect. This is some of the most seasoned and well-flavored food I've ever tasted. You won't be disappointed. Each dish is made with such care and every plate is distinct with it's own sense of flavors and personality.   I live in New York City and have frequented many restaurants of the culinary bad boys, Batali, Flay, Morimoto, and Lagasse; and this is definitely one of those great restaurants that puts Emeril on that list.   **Deal Seeking Diva tip** Secure yourself a reservation.

    "text": "I have been to 2 of emeril's restaurants in Florida and had exceptional experiences at both. This evening, I went to emeril's New Orleans fish house in Las Vegas.  I was not disappointed. I was on a trip with my mom and this was one of the restaurants I had always wanted to try, but I would advise making a reservation. The restaurant may appear to be a walk up place, but it gets busy quickly. We found out happy hour went until 6 pm. Our reservation was for 5:30 but we showed up early and they were happy to seat us then.  Our waiter told us the names of himself and 2 others that would be helping us. I asked if we could have happy hour specials even though we were sitting in the restaurant. He said of course and gave us the regular menu and the happy hour menu.  We ordered 2 apps from the happy hour menu (which were much less expensive than regular menu price) and I ordered a margarita from that same menu (VERY good) Then I asked if we could wait until later to order further. The servers were extremely helpful and accommodating. One of them even came up later and told us that happy hour was ending , just in case we wanted to order anything else. The 2 apps we ordered were the poke and the BBQ shrimp. Again, off the happy hour menu, so I'm not sure if they were smaller than what is offered on the regular menu, but it was the perfect amount for us. The shrimp app had 4 large grilled shrimp in a thick, wonderful, flavorful brown sauce and included a rosemary biscuit. The poke app came with a pile of amazing taro chips. Both were delicious. For our meal, we shared a wedge salad (fantastic) and the pecan crusted redfish over pepper jack grits and a ratatouille (all exquisite). The serving size was perfect - and they split both the salad and entree without charging extra.  I was very happy we tried so many wonderful things.  Service was extremely attentive.",

He used to be the Flay of cooking shows. Anyway... It was a dream come True to finally eat at one of his restaurants.   The crab cake was perfect. The grits sublime. Etouffee was fair, and the $80 lobster tail was disappointing (chewy).   The decor is boring in the main dining room and walls with their copper twists and cable strung art boxes were terribly dusty. The bar and entrance is charming.   As far as the service, we went in the afternoon and were quite neglected. With 13 people in the room (most of them prepping table settings for the dinner service and some walking back and forth... And three behind us at the water/wait station... ) I was surprised at how long we sat with empty drinks and no one noticing. Regardless of the dust and poor service, the food was great except for the over cooked lobster.   I look forward to visiting New Orleans and trying some more Emeril! Even with $80 chewy lobster, I still adore him and hope one day I get the chance to tell him face to face how he and his shows made a terrible time in my life so much better.",

Park in the garage, walk in through the Star Lane Shops, go through the casino to the Studio Walk shops and there you'll find Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Well, I found out it's worth the pain.  I had a show at the Venetian at 8 PM, so I made a reservation with Open Table for 5:30 and I was seated immediately.  Then began service that was equal to some of the finest restaurants at which I've eaten in this  town.  One of three people was always aware, in an unobtrusive way, where I was with any of the courses.  Within seconds of finishing a course, someone was there to ask if they could remove the dish.  When my iced tea was almost finished, a new glass was brought and replaced the old one without having to ask.  And, Emeril's passed my pink packet test with an A+ grade!  I began this review with the service first because I wanted it to be the stand out it was.  For the first course, I chose the Caesar salad with romaine hearts, parmesan cheese, roasted garlic grissini and a creamy house dressing.  Most of the description comes from the menu.  The dressing and shredded parmesan were outstanding.  For course two, I had to go with the gumbo.  After all, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, isn't it a law you have to try the gumbo.  It was a mixture of shrimp, chicken and Andouille pork suasage with okra and rice.  The gumbo had the proper thickness and it was peppery spicy, not hot sauce spicy.  it was very good.  For the main course, I went with the sweet barbecued Atlantic salmon.  My waiter said the chef suggested medium rare cooking.  I told him it could be closer to rare and that's just the way it was.  As the menu states, accompanying the salmon were \"spicy Andouille pork sausage hash, crystal fried onion crust And Emeril's house made Worcestershire.\"  There were pieces of Andouille, cubed potatoes, and some fresh tomatoes.  The salmon was excellent and the barbecue cooking gave me the chance to try salmon prepared in a different manner.  To end this dinner, I chose an item not on their online RW Week menu but is on their normal menu.  It's the flourless bourbon chocolate cake with sweet cherry compote and peanut butter mousse.  What a combination!  Delicious chocolate cake with some peanut butter mousse and some cherries.  One forkful was a blast of different flavors.  This is a winner.  There were also some chopped, glazed nuts for texture.  This was an excellent beginning to my Restaurant Week.   Note to M Life members.  If you take your receipt to the M Life club, they'll give you M Life points for the value of your dinner but you can't get it directly from Emeril's.",

    "text": "Review for HH only: 2-6 M-F, including food and drink specials. Good quality for HH, decent selection. You can get a light dinner for 2, sharing 4 dishes and a cocktail, with tip, for $50.   COCONUT CURRY STEAMED PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS: A must-order. For $8 you get a heap of mussels in a great sauce that tastes like a bowl of Tom Kha soup and curry powder hooked up one night. I just wish the table bread was more suitable for soaking up that great sauce. FALL RIVER CLAM CHOWDER: sounds pretty basic right? This wasn't my choice, but it ended up being one of my favorite dishes. BF called it the best clam chowder he can remember. Great creaminess, punch of seafood flavor, really comforting. SHRIMP, OKRA, AND ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: The main dish I was looking forward to, but underwhelmed by. I've had a lot of gumbo in my day and this one was solid but not the awesomeness I anticipated. Good subtle build-up of heat, lots of sausage, good value.  ALLIGATOR MEATBALLS: I've had alligator before, and I don't dislike the slight gaminess to the flavor, but I was unimpressed by the 'balls here. The creole aioli mustard was a slight drizzle, felt this dish didn't have much flavor. The most expensive dish we ordered, $4/ball, was not the same great value as the other dishes.  I wouldn't get this again.  HH prices only valid in bar area, recommend seating by the raw bar to watch the chef put together seafood dishes. Service was fine, restaurant isn't particularly large and has an awkward corner location. There isn't enough on their standard menu to tempt me to return for dinner.",

Sorry- but would not return or recommend!  I will say- I did complain about the po boy- the general manager was so very nice!! He took the Po boy off my bill and even gave my mom a huge slice of banana cream pie!! Which, by the way, was pretty incredible- filled with fresh bananas!

The king crab squid ink pasta was nice and buttery, so I was happy with that. But I usually order appetizers because I can't eat too much at a time, and I was still hungry after this tiny, $20 dish. I mean considering it's his New Orleans seafood spot, perhaps I should've ordered gumbo or jambalaya instead. I know it's Vegas and shit is overpriced, but I'm pretty easy to please and this was underwhelming. Bam? More like womp.",

I had to flag down the hostess and ask if a server had been assigned to our table.  Then our service was started by one server, continued by another, and finished by the original, which was fine but came with no explanation.  We had to ask for drink refills when they stopped by to drop off our next course.  Perhaps understaffed that day, which happens, but just communicate with us, let us know what's happening.  On food, I would highly recommend any of the food we had: 1) Complimentary cornbread and butter (some of the best I've had) 2) Barbecue shrimp (4 large pieces, big enough for 2 people but the sauce was outstanding, comes with a biscuit to help soak up some of the sauce - note that this sauce does not mesh well w/ the cornbread) 3) 10 oz flat iron steak with frites (OK - not outstanding - on flavor but incredibly juicy) 4) Side of mashed potatoes (very, very good if you like potatoes, HUGE serving, way bigger than two people and unnecessary since both the steak and lobster roll ended up coming with sides 5) Lobster roll (one of the best I've ever had although I didn't realize it came w/ any sides and ordered an unnecessary side of mashed potatoes)",

    "text": "After looking through the wonderful world of Yelp at the various famous chef restaurants in Vegas I decided on Emeril's and boy am I glad I did!   Made reservations during brunch for 5 pm (yes, food is always on my mind, even when I'm eating it).   We arrived at 4:40 and were seated right away. To start off I had the HH Louisiana Style Broiled Oysters 4 @ $12. It was love at first bite! Heavenly mixtures of garlic and creole goodness! Yes I soaked up that goodness on the delicious bread it came with and wished I had ordered more but my main course was yet to come. To drink I had the HH Classic Margarita @ $8 and just right!   For the main course I chose the 3 Course Tasting Menu for $45. First course I chose the Gumbo because you can't eat at a NOLA inspired restaurant and not have the Gumbo! Spicy is all that comes to mind when I think back on this dish. It came with 3 shrimps (which I cut into bite sized pieces) and enough sausage to feel satisfied with. If you like spice, I'd say this is your dish (although everyone's pallet is different). Would I order it again? No. In my opinion it wasn't anything special.  For the second course I chose the Beer Braised Short Rib. First bite I made sure to include all the yummy goodness that was on the plate, the smashed roasted root vegetables, the fried parsnips and that sauce (was it a reduction sauce or a gravy?) any-who, the first bite was... You ever take a bite of something, close your eyes and have an out of this world experience?  No? Eat here! Cutting through the meat was like cutting through butter (must be why they give you butter knives). I'd definitely order this dish again.   I also got the chance to try the Herb Roasted Chicken Breast ($28) and if I could order over I'd choose the chicken. The fact that I had such an experience with the short rib and I'd still choose the chicken over it, should tell you how excellent it was. It wasn't even the taste that amazed me (it was super delicious) but how well the chicken was cooked. If you knew me you'd know I do not like chicken breast as they are always over cooked but that's not the case here.   For the third course I chose the much praised Banana Cream Pie. As hyped as it is I'd say I was a bit disappointed. But let me explain... I don't like cold food/desserts. I felt if it was topped with hot fudge I would've been okay with instant death after this meal. Haha! There was caramel drizzled over it but I couldn't taste it and I was not a fan of the super crunchy crust.  But this is all personal preference, you may love all this.   Service was on par with the food which was a nice surprise as I've found you either have good food and bad service or vice versa. We were seated immediately, checked on numerous times and our waiters (there's a team of 3 per table) were very friendly.   5 stars because all in all I'd definitely eat here again and again. Well worth the money and the time it took to find it in the huge MGM Grand.",

I am from the coast so I know good fresh seafood. This year the seafood tower which costs $140 was not anything like last year nor was it of any quality near any good seafood restaurant- especially at a $140 price tag. The shrimp looked like they were thrown on the platter and they were not cooked completely. The lobster and crab claws weren't even cook completely. These shellfish should easily come out of their shell if cooked correctly but both had to be pried in little pieces because the meat was stuck to the shell. They did not give us butter sauces for the lobster so we asked but it never came. The waiter even told us that something didn't look right about the seafood tower but then said he was wrong after he checked with the kitchen. We liked Emeril's last year but it is clear something as gone down hill. We could have gotten much better seafood for a lot less at a lot of places.",

Which was DRY and overly toasted on the outside. Must've been sitting out there for a while. I was excited for them but just had one and already felt sad.   **From the HH menu:   -PORK BELLY SLIDERS (3): TERRIBLE, one of the three was 80% fat not to mention they were still too tough to bite through. As you pull it back, it would fall apart.   -SHRIMP AND SAUSAGE GUMBO: MEH. Major okra slime, salty, forgettable, shrimp was a mush as soon as you bite it. Another disappointment.   -4 Oysters $6: average, not freshly sweet as it should be.   **NON-HH menu:   -LOBSTER ROLL $23. WORST LOBSTER ROLL i have ever had. Full mayonase, zero lobster flavor, presentation subpar (see picture).   Service was great, too bad it doesn't match the food.   I would not recommend this place.

Grossly so, did you spill it in there?  And then my second appetizer came out, the scallop / lobster ravioli was waaaay too salty.  I did NOT pour their black sauce over it either, but I tried a drop of it on a spoon first - the waiter warned me that sauce was salty - so I did not use it -- the dish was too salty to eat Even without this sauce on it, would have rendered it uneatable  if I poured that on it.  So my review is..  could you guys in the kitchen try some OTHER spices other than being lazy with salt and pepper ?  To me, it's just LAZY to use cheap spices instead of spending the right time to get the other flavors to come thru ..  Really!!!!  Because those two without Cayenne, garlic, onion,  or any of the other awesome NOLA seasonings leave me with a very bad experience.  1 star",

    "text": "I have never received such awful customer service at the MGM Grand. If you are seated and served by a tall, blond man named Ivan, I would politely request another server. Not only did he pay no heed to my family's severe food intolerances and allergies by insisting we order dishes that involved our allergens but he also belittled them by suggesting that he too had the same food sensitivities and allergies and is \"fine with it\" which is ABSOLUTELY disrespectful to say to someone who has Crohns or MS. Our inquiries regarding the food were met with blunt, sarcastic remarks (\"What is in the clam chowder?\" \"Clams.\", \"Is your tea black or green?\" \"It's TEA.\") which made it seem as if he had no information regarding its ingredients or any decency to reply in a respectful way. He treated our table as if we were stupid, and unfortunately without knowing that one of us was a sous chef at a Michelin star restaurant and the other was a personal chef. The surf and turf came very salty and salads were absolutely not worth the exorbitant price. The shaved head busser/server huffed around our table with such attitude as if giving us water made us self-entitled. The only person I would give 5 stars to was a soft spoken man who politely continued to fill our waters and bussed our tables at the right time. We thought this would be a nice place to enjoy a meal but we left with such a bad taste in our mouths and spirits, we hope that no one experiences such poor service here.",

On this occasion, we had the trout which was very moist and flaky, seasoned perfectly. The beet salad was also a very generous portion that was proved to be a perfect starter to the main course. The Banana Cream pie was THE perfect dessert where the Bananas were ripe and the crust flaky and sweet but not overbearing. A very generous slice that was shared among 3 people.   Aside from the amazing food, the servers were friendly and well versed in the menu while the decor was modern and simple with a beautiful bar as a centerpiece.  Overall, a fantastic restaurant where the food shines above all else.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Emeril's in Las Vegas and I must say that  enjoyed the food and ambiance at this location, much more than I did in New Orleans.  The restaurant is not very large in size, which makes your dining experience a little more intimate.  Before ordering the wine sommelier was nice and knowledgeable.  During my visit, I ordered from their 'Try 3 Pairing' Menu, which started off at $50.  On this menu, they have several appetizer selections to choose from such as an Apple salad, Lobster Bisque, Crab Cake, etc. The main dishes consisted of Herb Roasted Free Range Chicken Breast, Beer Braised Short Rib, etc.  For dessert you had the choice of Emeril's Banana Cream Pie, New Orleans Pecan Pie, and Homemade Fresh Fruit Sorbet.  To complete my order, I decided to order the Lobster Bisque, which was okay.  Next, I order the Herb Roasted Free Range Chicken Breast with Brussels Sprouts and Potato, while ending my meal with the Mango Sorbet.  Overall, I would consider returning here in the future.",

So my expectations were low.  The Blue Points were fresh and the accompanying condiments added a wonderful zest.  The beet salad with cheese and walnuts, sprinkled with greens was delightful.  The pecan coated redfish with grits was a hearty portion and prepared in the time honored creole style.  My dining companion was very happy with the Mahi Mahi.  Service was friendly and prompt.  One item that irked me was how the crackers were served with the oysters: in those little plastic package that may go well in a low price establishment but not when you are paying $3 an oyster. Small things matter",

It was nothing like the fried crab cakes I've had back home in Texas, and I found it delicious! The Frog Legs were $9 instead of $15 because of Happy Hour! They are a MUST try. I would come back just for the Frog Legs.  Afterwards, I ordered the Chef's 5-Course Tasting. I highly recommend doing this. It includes smaller portions of the items on the menu and a full dessert.",

The Food: The 8 ounce filet and scallops (with gnocchi pasta) were cooked to perfection. The side of wild mushrooms were good. Their signature dessert, the banana cream pie, was the best I had ever had! I've included a few pictures of the meal with the steak being the half portion picture (we split it) and the pie was dug into before we took a photo (my apologies to the chef). The free amuse appetizer was just \"ok\". 5 Star meal!  The Service:  We were greeted warmly and the servers (more than one were attending to us) were prompt and helpful.  Ambience: Comfortable seating and the restaurant music wasn't crazy loud like many of the Las Vegas restaurants.  We will definitely go back to Emeril's the next time we're in Las Vegas!",

The shrimp cocktail were enjoyable and the shrimp was fresh and properly cleaned/deveined which are necessities to me. The BBQ shrimp were a must try along with the gumbo as the BBQ sauce went perfectly with the shrimp without being too sweet or heavy. The sliders were good as well but the seafood here is the star of the show.

The seared cherry tomatoes, bite-size pieces of green beans, and other flavors complimented the seafood beautifully. The server recommended a wine that harmonized well with the meal.  This was a lunch offering: $21 for the fish, $3 for a side of rice (which was a special request), $13 for the wine + 19% tip. It was well worth the money. I would go back.  P.S. They have a 3-course \"Tasting Menu\" in the evening for $50. I think I saw this delicious trout in the advertisement pic.",

    "text": "I was with a friend who had no choice but to grab lunch at MGM since the convention was going on and she only had about an hour so we were limited on our choices.  Emeril's NOFH was the only one without a long wait on a Friday afternoon during a massive convention so we went with it.  Honestly, I wish we hadn't.  I have never been so disappointed by an Emeril brand restaurant.    I don't mind paying good money for GOOD food but this was so utterly mediocre it was painful.  I had the lobster roll, which after viewing a friend's recent post from Maine on facebook of an INCREDIBLE lobster roll, this was simply tragic.  Tiny.  Hideously tiny portion.    But that was nothing compared to the Po Boy Shrimp sandwich my friend had.  Seriously, 80% bread and 20% shrimp.  It was ridiculous.  The bread should have had some removed.  As she remarked, hasn't anyone seen Chopped?! The judges would have roasted the person who made that - it's a mouthful of bread with a seasoning of shrimp.    Our waitress was friendly but lacking towards the end and unapologetic when we POLITELY told her how we felt about the food.  We were along the lines of, \"Yeah, the shrimp was good, but it was so much bread and the fries were incredibly salty.\" And she didn't say a word, then went right into offering us dessert.  Very disappointing service - EXCEPT for the hostess.  She was sweet and personable.    Absolutely do not recommend and Emeril, you know better.",

I ate at three place previously and they didn't ask me for I'd during payment, not to mention double the price dinner I paid for without issue. All other locations had professional staff, this place just felt cheap and off. I wouldn't come back or recommend this place.",

Starting with the hostess who seated us, we were treated like frequent customers.  We had three servers (including our head server) who treated us as though ours was their only table that night.  Together they offered suggestions, kept our water glasses filled, and kept our used dishes cleared off (all without disturbing the conversation at our table).  I took our server's suggestion and ordered the Lobster Pot Pie from the menu. I've never eaten anything like it, and I must say that this menu item is a big part of the reason I gave 5 stars.  My wife is not much for seafood, so she got the small filet mignon.  I glanced over to her plate from time to time, and it was obvious that it was cooked perfectly.  My wife said that it was very tender and juicy and flavorful.  Indeed, I usually get a morsel or two after she eats her fill...but not last night. Our trip to Emeril's last night will keep it on our list of places to visit when we come to Las Vegas",

My crab cake was so-so... my co-workers version of hers was way too salty.  However, my other coworkers mussels she said was good.  If you dine in at their bar they serve you free corn bread with butter which was excellent.  Drinks according to my expert coworker was watered down and an old fashioned wasn't so old fashioned.  Our food also took sometime to come out but I think that was to be given considering it was CES 2017 week and being on a Saturday night.  Overall, it was an okay experience.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that I have been coming here for many years. Loved the restaurant, the service and the experience so much that I asked my wife to marry me here 10 years ago. Last year we came in, and service was very poor, but we love the food so much that we decided to try it again on this trip.   We went for a late lunch and decided to sit at the bar for happy hour. After waiting a few minutes, we finally got menus and water but the bartender rushed away without saying a word. Another 10 minutes passed before I called the bartender over to ask if we could actually order a drink. She took our order, and then proceeded to seat and serve 2 other people next to us, and then served food to 4 people at the far end of the bar. She finally came over to say she is very busy. Mind you, we were 4 of 10 total people at the bar, and I counted at least 12 employees, not a single one doing anything, and the dining room had 2 tables.   Next problem, everyone of our 4 drinks could not be made because their CO2 tanks were not working. So she disappeared again. I saw what I'm assuming was a manager because he was the only one in a suit, VERY nonchalantly finally come over and shake a wire, and then walk away. Still nothing. I finally get the bartender to take our food order while our 4 glasses of water sat empty, and we got 2 bottles of beer because apparently it was the only drink they could offer.   Food arrives, BBQ shrimp is still absolutely amazing, even though the size of the shrimp seems to be getting smaller & smaller during every visit. Main course shows up.... shrimp po'boy. While the shrimp was very good, the bread was stale, & the lettuce and tomato seemed like leftovers from the day before at best. I got the sauce on the side because I've read that they tend to overdress it. I ate the shrimp and dipped in the Cajun sauce which gets 4 out of 5 stars from me but the complete sandwich would get a 2 if I was feeling generous   I get the bill within seconds of asking for it, and not even an apology for the lack of being able to provide what we wanted, or for the poor service. I'm never one to want free stuff, but an acknowledgment of the failure on their part would have been nice. I'm typically at least a 20% tipper if not more if the experience is good, but She got a 5% tip, which was generous. Had they at least had 15-20 customers, the staff of at least 15 people been slightly busy, I could have over looked some of it, but this was just a complete lack of standards from the onsite manager down to our bartender.   I really wish someone would go back and review the standards in this place because it used to be a destination that I went out of my way for, but at this point it is officially part of the past. Such a shame.",

We are  a big fan of New Orleans style cuisine so this fit right up our alley. we started off with the Heirloom tomato salad, which was very nice. The tomatoes were not at all mushy and had the perfect snap when you bit into them. Also, had the Raw oyster special where these half dozen were from WA state. Just delicious!  For the main course I had the Ribeye. Perfectly cooked steak @ med rare. Good flavor and size. So compared to the Cowboy Ribeye at Beauty and Essex - it beat that one out. Compared to the ribeye I had a Golden Steer and New York that I had at Harvest - Not quite there. But still good nonetheless. The wife had the trout with crab meat. That was really good. I had a side of Jambalaya - which was one of the best I've had since being in New Orleans.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie which was on point!  The ambiance and feel of the restaurant was very nice and the service was very good, as well!   Would I go here again? Yes.",

We both got the pan roast..... I'm not sure if it was just my dish but was EXTREMELY to spicy nothing on my plate I could eat and I eat spicy food..... I was to frustrated to eat anything else    We got the taste of New Orleans dessert platter which was YUMMY  I did enjoy that....  And my drink was extremely yummy!!   I don't think I would ever go back but I do appreciate the manager taking off my pan roast that was super appreciated .... I'm a huge foodie me and my girl love to eat but I wasn't pleased",

    "text": "**Restaurant Week Menu** and some regular menu items:  I've been here in the past, and a group of friends and I decided to come here for the last day of Restaurant Week.  This is probably my favorite place to go for Restaurant Week and here's why:  Comes with a 3 course meal for $50.15.  I ordered the shrimp Andouille sausage gumbo, flat iron steak, banana creme pie, and a latte.  Also tried some seared ahi tuna, creole fries, broiled oysters with parmesan, and alligator meatballs for fun.     We started off with cornbread and butter.  The cornbread was sweet, and I'm always happy when the butter I get is spreadable (because it doesn't happen often).   Typically for Restaurant Week, venues provide smaller portions of their menu for you to try.  Not this place.  I had a full portion of gumbo to start.  Between the cornbread and gumbo, I thought I wasn't going to have any room for steak or dessert.  Somehow I managed.  :D   Anyways, the gumbo had the perfect amount of salt.  It includes shrimp, okra, rice, and andouille sausage.  Very savory, hearty, and delicious.    The seared ahi tuna was drizzled in ponzu sauce and came with a side of creole fries.    We also ordered broiled oysters with Parmesan.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was served on a bed of sea salt and red peppercorns, but the oysters were already seasoned enough.  Expensive ($3.50 ea), but it was very good.    The alligator meatballs came with a small amount of collard greens.  Interesting flavor.  Wasn't bad.  I think it lacked some flavor.    When I ordered flat iron steak from the Restaurant Week menu, I was expecting small flat iron steak, but nooooo.  This steak was large, thick, and juicy!  It was cooked exactly how I wanted: medium rare.  The steak was drizzled in some red sauce and came with a side of sauteed onions, a couple of cloves of garlic, and fried mushrooms.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, but the steak was very tender and juicy.  I only had room for half the steak.    Last, I got the banana creme pie.  OMG, this is probably my favorite dessert....right next to creme brulee!  Come to think of it, I think this banana creme pie outranks creme brulee in my book.  I inhaled it.    Also finished with a latte.  They serve my favorite coffee brand: Illy.  Came in a cute cup that had the perfect portion of latte.  It was also served a little warmer than room temperature, but that's how I like my coffee/lattes anyway.    Overall, I had a great Restaurant Week experience here.  All the items in the Restaurant Week menu are also available on the regular menu.  It was awesome that they served them in full sized portions.  I am definitely a fan of Emeril's!",

    "text": "I was on the fence between 1 or 2 stars for this place. I went with 2. I guess the food wasn't absolutely terrible. Just not very good.  We were here for quick lunch before heading back to the airport to catch our flight so we just had a couple appetizers to share.  Gumbo, frog legs, crab cakes, creole fries. All pretty bland (although the gumbo did have a nice kick). No depth of flavor. I got the impression the cooks here are just recipe followers who aren't putting any passion or effort into the food they're putting out.  Gumbo: 95% white rice in a bowl with a couple chunks of Andouille sausage and a couple shrimps.  Crab Cakes: Looked great on my plate until I dug into it with a fork and it completely disintegrated into a pile of flavorless bread crumbs and very little crab or anything else. Mostly just dry flavorless breadcrumbs.  Frog legs: Ive never tried them but thought Id give them a try here. They tasted like flavorless, greasy chicken wings (although meatier than a typical chicken wing). The breading covered maybe 30% of the meat, the rest was all over the plate.  Hand Cut Creole Fries: I don't know what that pretty colored red seasoning was on the fries. But it tasted like nothing.   We thought of having dinner here on one of our nights out while staying at the MGM for the weekend. Glad we went somewhere else instead.  This place has been part of the MGM's restaurant offerings for a while but I would say it has probably seen better days.",

I've had the standard dinner at Emeril's once and it was quite good, but that would probably have been a four star review.   But if you dine at the Kitchen Table... that's a totally different story. We were treated to a seven course meal that was improvised by the restaurant's head chef the day our host booked the table... though I'm usually against the idea of Fois Gras, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted when they served it... so I enjoyed it with a side-helping of Jewish guilt. Each course was served with a glass of wine that was perfectly paired with the food we were enjoying. And after the main meal, the servers brought us an endless selection of the restaurant's entire dessert menu... unsurprisingly, Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie was gone within minutes of hitting the table.   This was one of the most impressive meals I've ever experienced... and it's easy to say that it was worth every penny since I didn't pay for it, but the check game out to about $450 per person... in a group of about 20 people.

Almost thought I was eating at a French restaurant.   Signature Banana cream pie was not like Nawlins. Lacking was texture of the filling, crust firmness, flavor, adequate carmel saucing and the shaved chocolate chunks (crumbled chocolate was substituted).   While suits abound throughout the service side, the kitchen staff has definitely stepped it down a notch or two. Or perhaps Emerill has shifted his focus to his other three Las Vegas outlets at the Venetian.",

Now imagine my disappointment to find that the menu has less to do with New Orleans than your average Long John Silvers (please note the food is much better than LJS, the menu is not).  So what we did get was great service, a good atmosphere, and really good food. If your looking for a fine fish house with a limited menu I suppose Emril's is fine. Personally I say pass and look for RM down the way.  Still looking for Cajun food in Las Vegas.",

But anyone that knows me well knows that I'm a procrastinator. But I digress. We started with the clam chowder and a scallop appetizer. Both of these starters were quite pretty tasty but nothing spectacular. They sure didn't make up for my overcooked stuffed lobster or the hubby's whole fish. The waiter (don't even get me started on that creeper) advertised the fish as a better deal for ravenous mate. It may have weighed more in ounces but that was just due being honored with the job of picking around the bones and all the other inedible parts.   We will not be back.",

And yes it is expensive (dinner for 3 cost us $180 including the tip.), but that keeps the riff-raft out and in Las Vegas there's plenty of low brow riff-raft everywhere! Started dinner with The Martinez ($16)-best mixed drink I've had in a long time. One thing I like about Las Vegas restaurants is they waste no time getting the booze in front of you. We ordered a sushi roll (good), mac & cheese (great), lobster bisque (very good); kale salad (very good); ahi tuna steak (excellent); collard greens (the best!) and topped it off with banana cream pie (better than sex). The service was A+. My wife initially ordered the clam chowder but it had bacon in it. When we told the waiter my wife was a vegetarian, he suggested the bisque and took away the chowder at no charge to us. After dinner, we walked over to see the show \"Ka\". Not a cheap evening out for our family, but one we completely enjoyed and will remember. We'll be back.",

    "text": "I would definitely come here again but maybe just for appetizers and banana creme pie. Our waiter was very friendly and talkative (he looked like George Clooney and spoke like he was in the 1950s...pretty entertaining). My bf's family and I ordered too many appetizers so by the time we were done with that, I was completely stuffed. We started off with the clam chowder (with applewood bacon) and gumbo (spicy with rice, sausage, shrimp). Both the soups came in a tiny pot and was poured into a bowl in front of us by the waiter. Cool presentation :) The bacon wrapped scallops were amazing! I've never had scallops that HUGE before. Crabcakes were also really good with the apple slaw garnished on top. Mac n cheese was also good, but the cornbread was pretty mediocre. I also ordered a cocktail --New Orlean's Nectar which was very good. For the main course, I had the BBQ salmon. I wanted it cooked medium which was the perfect texture, but I was so full from appetizers that I couldn't enjoy the salmon that much.  I also tried my bf's lobster risotto which was a little bit too creamy and heavy for my liking, but they definitely did not skimp on the lobster. Meat lovers should definitely try their ribeye that came on the wood it was cooked on. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and banana creme pie. I am not usually a big pie fan, but the banana creme pie with fresh bananas was probably the pie i've had. The tiramisu was not good (compared to Shibuya's which I had the night before), so no need to try that. The meal came about to be $300 for a party of 4, so not bad-- worth a try.",

The different textures and blending of flavors made it very clear to me that this was the reason Emeril is a master chef. The entree portion was pretty large. With tip, my bill came to $52. It was a little pricey for lunch, but well worth the quality and experience.",

For our other choice, I asked the waiter if we should have the Creme Brulee or the Bread Pudding. He emphatically recommended the Bread Pudding.   The Banana Creme pie was excellent. BUT, the Bread Pudding was better than excellent. It was fabulous- one of the best desserts I've had.  I was also impressed with the waiter (and the rest of the staff)- a perfect combination of professionalism and friendliness.

We had the fresh tuna and butter lettuce wraps which were phenominal!  The tuna with basil and ponzu oils were such a good compliments to each other.   We ordered the gumbo and the clam chowder next and I have to say that the clam chowder had a good and unusual smoky flavor.  (Maybe coming from andouillie sausauge?  Or maybe it was the \"bam?!\")  \r The service here was really good too.  My friend had the grilled ahi tuna with heirloom tomatoes she mentioned to our waiter that she was allergic to tomatoes and asked if something else can be substituted for it.  This was no problem of course, but moments later the waiter cheerfully came back and told her that the  gumbo that she ordered had tomatoes also and asked if she needed something else instead.  Thankfully, she was only allergic to fresh tomatoes and not the cooked so was still able to have it  which she said was delicious.  The tuna however was a little salty (they gave her a salad instead) without the tomatoes, but she was thankful at the fact that the waiter cared enough to check on the food allergy.\r Overall the rest of the entrees that we had were decent at best.  I would definitely come back just for the chowder and the tuna wraps alone.",

How about Emeril's? The service was top notch, starting with our waitress asking if any of us had time constraints - 3 of us had to rush back to the airport, so that she asked was awesome.    The apps were good - shrimp with a tini tiny little rosemary biscuit, crab cakes and fried calamari.  They were good, but not amazing, but then again, pretty generic items.  There were more interesting apps., but that's what we all wanted.  The wait staff brought out our food, stood staggered between us , and delivered our food with a semi-flourish.  It was very sweet.  We oohed and ahed.  I enjoyed my Seafood Pan Roast served with Two Medallions of Fresh Fish, Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, Traditional Seafood Jambalaya and Essence Spiked Butter Sauce.  It was pretty rich, though, and I ended up just eating the fish.   I liked the space and that there was lots of space between tables.  This very reserved group of clients opened up here and I think they...felt special...:-) The next day,  the clients sent very warm thank you notes and mentioned several times how much they enjoyed their dinner.  There were no vegetarian entrees on the menu, otherwise, I'd give 4 stars.",

Despise the Valentine's Day rush, we were greeted almost immediately by our waiter Lawrence.  He was very professional and well knowledgable throughout the entire dinner experience. Never once were we rushed through our amazing dining experience.  Our drink order was taken immediately and was served with warm bread.  As we waited very shortly for our appetizers, a small bite sized tasting was placed before us. An absolute surprise that definitely started our night off right.  As appetizers, we had an apple salad and oysters. Absolutely amazing. Perfect portion size and flavor combinations.  We went with the barbeque salmon that was plated atop of vegetables, potatoes, and sausage. Piled on top of the salmon was a creole onion crust. My boyfriend ordered a medium-rare steak. It came out at the perfect temperature. The size was large, but that's what I expected from Emeril's.  Lawrence stopped by our table to deliver a rose.  His service was incredible and definitely exceeded our expectations.  The managers stopped by to assure that everything was taken care of to our liking, which is amazing to have that one-on-one interaction.  You can definitely tell they cared about this establishment.  We of course had to try the banana cream pie, their specialty. It was one-of-a-kind.  Along side was a great moscato to end the night right. Both waiters had wished us a great night and another thank you from another employee on the way out of the door.  All in all, an amazing experience with delectable food and service with a smile.",

The restaurant is situated at the center of the MGM casino and the location reminds me more of a restaurant you'd find at a strip mall. The decor is nice but unmoving with no view to the outdoors. The restaurant also lacks its own restrooms, so you have to use the casino's facilities located down the corridor--try explaining to your party why it took you so long to get back from the restroom...  As for the food, it is way over seasoned, be it the crab cakes, the Texan Redfish, the gumbo or the pork chops. The quality of the ingredients was also questionable. The pork chops were poor cuts, completely fatty, and cooked poorly (burnt on the outside and rare on the inside).   Finally, this seemingly fancy restaurant is without a sommelier, although it boasts a comprehensive wine selection.  Our server recommended a white wine (as most of the dining party had fish) which was more of a desert wine that did not compliment any of the dishes.  With the food being salty, the wine tasted even sweeter.   In the end, great company, not the restaurant, made the dining enjoyable.",

    "text": "For our Vegas trip we made a plan to dine here.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  Two people in our group ordered the lobster bisque as a starter.  It was amazing.  If you're into smells, than this soup will blow your mind.  The taste was also impressive.  The only thing negative was the lack of pieces of lobster meat.  It's a cream-based bisque that is really smooth and velvety.  Others ordered the bbq ribs, macaroni and cheese, and the chargrilled oysters as appetizers.  For dinner, I had the shrimp and sausage pasta.  The shrimp were pretty large and the sausage was very flavorful.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding (very smooth) and key lime pie.  The pie had a velvety smooth texture.  Not your usual key lime pie.  Both were amazing!  The restaurant's ambiance is modern and contemporary.  Even though we didn't have reservations, we were seated right away (there was only 4 in our party).  It was a Friday night around 7:30 pm and they weren't very busy.  It was also the Friday after Thanksgiving.  I think it was a slow season for Vegas.  Overall, the restaurant was superb.  A little pricey, but you are paying for the Emeril name.  I'd definitely go back.",

Service was very polite and friendly, but the kitchen was painfully slow. 3 different kinds of oysters but our waiter couldn't tell us the difference between them. The frog legs were tasty but very oily. The crawfish and trout was really salty. My boyfriend got the ribeye fillet and couldn't finish more than a few bites because the reduction was way too rich and pungent.   Best part were the pretzel rolls, wasn't worth a $140 bill",

    "text": "Wanted to celebrate my birthday with a meal at Emeril's at the MGM Hotel. My wife and I shared a bowl of gumbo, sweet barbecued Scottish salmon, and pecan crusted Texas redfish. Every aspect of the service was absolutely outstanding. Shortly after we sat down, they brought us a small handout. Very tasty. Next came the gumbo. They were kind enough to split the gumbo in the kitchen. There was ample sausage, shrimp, and other goodies in the broth. It was good, but not great. The seafood restaurant in our local casino does an equally good job with their gumbo. I expected more from Emeril. The barbecue salmon had an andouille pork sausage and potato hash accompaniment. Delish!! The pecan crusted redfish came with pepper jack cheese grits and creole meuniere sauce. Yumm! Both fish dishes were terrific. So with excellent service and two main courses that were outstanding, why the 3 star rating? For me to give 4 or 5 stars, it has to be a restaurant that I want to return to soon. As a local, driving to the restaurant required parking at the MGM hotel. MGM has decided to add $15 to the cost of a meal at an MGM restaurant. Boy that pisses me off. I won't be going back soon. Hence 3 star review.",

Standout wine by the glass: The Rocco (Grigsby vineyard) was velvety and jammy nicely balanced tannins.  Overall, great experience and I will be back again.",

I live for a little spice in my food, and each had enough.  The crab was my favorite--fresh jumbo crab, the capers really add to this dish too.  The gumbo was good, average taste, and the salmon entre was good...he adds Andalusia (spelling? Sorry Andalusians if incorrect) sausage to spice it up, but the salmon itself is so fresh and light, it weights it down too much for me.  But it was good.  It would be a better dish if they ditched the sausage on this one.. Service impeccable.  Host stunningly gorgeous.  Nice hiring Emeril!",

Tiny... $12 Any Trader Joes Salad is better than this!!!!!  Crab Cake $18..  Save your $...  Not crab cake..  Just crab meat topped with greens and veggies.  Ate it because I didnt want to waste it.  Jambayala:  Good flavor and the rice was cooked al dente.  Biggest complaint that it was COLD in the center.  Yes, like microwaved COLD!    Gumbo:  Good flavor and seemed like the only dish that was genuinely heated on the stove and not nuked.    Our server was polite so no complaints there.    The food was definitely a dissapointment.    BAM!",

    "text": "Hey single ladies, I know you like to party Girl come and kick it with me Calling all single ladies here tonight Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa at...EMERIL'S FISH HOUSE! - Remady (single ladies)  After watching KA, you gotta be savvy about where to eat, especially with the influx of people coming from the show. Unfortunately, both our phones were out of batteries so I chose a place that wasn't super packed but was also a new experience, and it turned out better than I could've hoped for! I guess it was just a coincidence that Emeril was one of the main judges for the most recent Top Chef season...in New Orleans...  First thing I noticed while walking past the bar towards our table was a trio of cheesecakes that I knew I had to order at the end. Since I'm not familiar with creole cuisine, we skipped the regular appetizers on the menu and went straight to the New Orleans appetizers. The bbq shrimp was good, and what made it special for me were the biscuits since it made it a genuine creole experience. The baked oysters were so tasty with tiny hints of bacon in them. A memorable start so far.  Seeing as how this is ultimately a seafood restaurant, we shared the baked lobster and the barbeque salmon. First of all, the amount of lobster is not a joke. It's substantial and really really good. The balance between the flavors and heartiness of the lobster and the bbq salmon were wonderful. The salmon brought a lighter feel to the meal and had no complaints with the andouille sausage it was paired with. If you love lobster, you will not be disappointed here.   We sat next to a couple and the gentleman was celebrating his 60th bday coinciding with valentines day weekend and we shared a delightful dessert conversation. Even though we were stuffed, I couldn't resist and had to order the trio of cheesecakes...if I remember correctly, one was normal and there was a chocolate one and a caramel one or something. Yay for cheesecakes! With all this being said, I look forward to more New Orleans inspired dishes in the future.",

Though it was steady inside the restaurant, we were seated instantly. As we sat down at our table, the hostess set our linen cloths on our laps for us.. Cool! I thought that was awesome!   Our waitress was very kind and attentive and she answered all our questions. She was also quite informative about all the small details such as ingredients and what tastes best, and most importantly, she was very knowledgeable on the menu. I did not catch her name, but she had layered, brown hair with side bangs. Terrific service!  The basket of bread was to die for -- I ate probably around 5 rolls before my main dish. So, so, so good!   I ordered the shrimp creole. It contained a plentiful amount of shrimp along with grits (amazing!!), beans, and a delicious tomato sauce. I loved what I ordered and savored every last bite.  My brother and mom enjoyed their meals too. Sadly, the three of us were too stuffed to order dessert, as I'm sure Emeril's dessert menu is to die for. Had I gotten dessert, I most likely would have given this restaurant the full, five stars.

I ordered the gumbo but the portion was appetizer sized and the shrimp (not shrimps) was overcooked. On the positive side, it was very lively and looked out onto the hustle-bustle of the casino.

To me since the food was great and my concerns were appreciated and customer feedback seems to be valued I decided to add a extra star! I can't wait to be able to update with my experience once I make my way back to try the giant lobster that the person next to us was having!",

For my entree I had rockfish with steamed littlenecks in a clam cream sauce.  good but didn't wow me.  For dessert I had a chocolate almond coconut tart served with chocolate ice cream.  Good, but again, not great.  I mostly ate the filling and the ice cream. My friends, however, really loved this place (one had the gumbo and the sea bass and the other had steak) so maybe I am just jaded.",

The menu was interesting (I chose the pecan crusted redfish) and the dishes were cooked to perfection.  The bar menu was somewhat limited so, after being reassured that they had a full bar, we ordered something off menu and they delivered a delicious cocktail - I didn't see their bartender but they clearly know what they're doing.  The service was really, really good - both the lead and his assistant were attentive and responsive - great service, overall.  The combo of the food, drink, service topped off with an over-the-top banana cream pie made it a great experience and evening.",

    "text": "I stopped by this restaurant to view their menus. The hostesses were not busy and yet seemed indifferent to me even asking to view the menus. I noticed that Fall River Clam Chowder was served. I was excited about this and shared with the hostesses that I was born and raised in Fall River and Emeril actually lived next door to my grandmother. They seemed completely disinterested. I mean...how many times has a guest been actually from Fall River??? I asked if it was possible to place a take-out order of the chowder and they indicated yes with no problem. So, we left and I tried to keep this is an option for later. I returned the next day, same hostesses, same poor disposition. However, I really wanted to order the chowder and they have nothing to do with that. When I inquired about the ordering, they said I needed to order at the bar. I went to the bar and placed an order for 2 Fall River Clam Chowders to go. My husband, being from the midwest, wants nothing to do with any seafood, so he had picked up something else from the food court. He met me at the bar while I waited for my order. After about 15 minutes, I had to ask for a glass of water. No offer of water or any other beverage was offered to me. Another poor bat at service. Then after my water was brought to me, the bartender told me that they were out of containers and could not fulfill my take-out order. So, my husband asked...trying to be kind to me, if he could eat his food there if I changed to dine-in. They said no. So strike 1, 2 and 3. Never got my Fall River Clam Chowder! And I will likely not ever in the future as this experience has left me completely dissatisfied and will not recommend or return. Wicked BAD all around.",

    "text": "I've walked by this place so many times and never went in. It's probably because I'm not a real big seafood eater. But what really caught my eye was the specials they had one day - Lobster Bisque and Striped Sea Bass. That just sounded really really good.   Before I sat down, they asked me my name, which I thought was weird. But when the waiter came over and addressed me with Mr. B, I realized that is why they asked me. He asked me what I wanted to drink and all I could think of then was water. When he brought my water back, I ordered the lobster bisque and also asked what type of beer they had. They have a huge selection of wines - the bottles are all over the place. They also had a huge selection of beers. And, as I mentioned to the waiter, since this was Emeril's place, did they have Abita? Heck yeah, I ordered a Turbo Dog.  Now, here is where the fun begins. Do you know when you see those people in the fancy restaurants on TV when they get a lot of people rushing towards your table with everything you need. Well, that is what happened when they brought my Lobster Bisque to me. The waiter put down my bisque, followed by the bread guy, and then followed by the beer guy. They just kept coming and coming. haha  The lobster bisque was amazing. The flavor of the lobster was, and this term usually means something bad but in this case it isn't, overpowering. By that, I mean there was lots of lobster flavor, yet you could still taste all of the individual ingredients. When chefs say that on TV, I always laugh. But in this case that is exactly what they did.   Next up, the Striped Sea Bass. This was cooked with bell peppers, baby spinach, russet potatoes, and a rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction. They also had a striped sea bass on the menu prepared differently, but this was the special so I got that. I ordered a second Turbo Dog when the sea bass got there. The combination of the two was fantastic. Perfect flavor combo. The rosemary garlic (BAM!) reduction was incredible with the fish.   To top off this perfect meal, I ordered a coffee and their Bread & Butter Bread Pudding with Warm Whiskey Sauce.   And, I can't forget to mention the service. The service here rocked. My waiter was always around and they paid close attention to my \"fluid levels\" throughout the night. My water was always refilled quickly, as well as my coffee. The waiter knew the menu very well and was able to describe everything (I heard him describing some of the specials to the table next to me and he wasn't just delivering a \"script.\" He was describing things in great detail). All of my dishes and place settings were picked up promptly and the silverware was also picked up between the current courses.  I always stay at the MGM when I go to Vegas, so this will become my \"regular\" place after my recent visit. Next time I'm going to try that Filet Mignon au poivre.",

    "text": "Emeril's is my favorite place for a upscale dinner in Las Vegas.  I always get the chef's tasting menu paired with the sommelier's wine flight.  It's pricey, ~$150/person with the wine but well worth it!.  On my most recent trip to Emeril's, my boyfriend and I were celebrating my birthday and our chef tasting menu was as follows:  1st couse - Stone Crab Claw Salad with shaved apples, honey-glazed marcona almonds and butter lettuce topped with machengo cheese - this was one of our favorite courses, the crab was so fresh!  Paired wine was a nice, dry champagne from France  2nd course - Lobster Pappardelle Pasta with fresh mushrooms - so rich and delicious, I shouldn't have eaten so much and saved more room for later!  Paired wine was Pinot Grigio, cut through the richness of the pasta very nicely  3rd course - Pan-Roasted Black Bass in basil pesto with a Sicilian capitone sauce and crispy pancetta - loved this dish too!  Paired wine was a white blend of viognier, grenache, marsanne and rousanne from Paso Robles, this was divine  4th course - Cornmeal-crusted fried quail and corn hash, our least favorite, a bit too gamey for us. But the paired wine was Pinor Noir, my favorite, yum :)  5th course - Cedar Plank Campfire Rib-Eye with with Louisiana-style shrimp etouffee and an andouille pork sausage - this was SO good but I was so full by this point that I couldn't finish.  All 3 components were awesome and the etouffee sauce on the rib-eye was excellent!  Paired wine was Cab Sav, so full-bodied and luscious  6th course - New Orleans-style bread and butter bread pudding - to die for!  I was so full but this tasted so good I had to finish it.  Paired wine was Moscato di Asti, not too sweet and the bubbles were quite lovely  The service is impeccable.  We had two waiters who both new the food and wine backwards and forwards!  If you're in Vegas and want to spend some dough on dinner, head over to the MGM Grand, Emeril's does not disappoint!",

We did go in about an hour before closing, which usually means the staff is winding down and starting to prepare for closing. I ordered a whole fish entree-- it was delicious, but the bones were not easy to eat around. The bones usually stay in tact and you can pull them all out by the tailbone. No such luck. My fiance's seafood pasta dish was very bland. The seafood was fresh but the pasta sauce had no flavor at all. Great service, great wine, great chowder, but the whole fish entree was not easy to eat because the bones were too soft and just fell off the tailbone when i tried to remove it-- and I order whole fish from other places. The pasta dish was just not good.",

It was a very slow Tuesday early evening and despite the ample open tables (and the fact that we were nearly run over by the throngs of shirtless kids coming from the nearby hotel pool), the hostess acted very snobby and put out that we didn't have reservations. After we were sat, no one came by with menus for several awkward minutes. Service overall was incredibly slow- especially considering how empty the restaurant was. Our server was very friendly and likable though (when we saw him). The food was just ok. My husband loved his crawfish special but the restaurant was not very accommodating to my gluten free diet and several of my shrimp were not deveined (yuck!) Overall it was meh. I wouldn't return considering the snooty atmosphere and less than stellar service. For the price, this was definitely not worth it.",

We waited 30 minutes to even order and 40 minutes between finishing our salad and receiving our entree whereas the table next to us had sat down later and finished earlier. Additionally the sauce on my plate, or lack thereof, was dried on my plate and the manager's excuse was the plate must have been so hot that it vaporized on the plate. Try...it sat under a heat lamp long enough to dry hard on the plate.   While overall the flavors were good and my spinach and snow crab salad was AMAZING, it's hard to look past terrible service with not even an attempt to make the situation better.   With all of the phenomenal restaurants in Las Vegas, this place, unfortunately, will not be on the repeat list.",

This one was no different and the bbq shrimp, gumbo, calamari, gratin and seafood stew did not disappoint.   I gave it 3 stars this time for 2 specific reasons - the service was slow and seemed disinterested, maybe because we did not order any wine?  More important, we ordered the bread pudding which we all like and consider this as Emeril's signature dessert. What was served was anything but. Dont know if they ran out or it was half baked, what we got was soggy and pasty -no where near what we have had before. No clear explanation provided, not that it mattered.

So here we go; these were the dishes we started with: Seafood Gumbo, Yellow Fin Tuna Tacos, Ham and Shrimp Jambalaya, and Crawfish Ettoufe. Lets start with the Gumbo. The Rue (not sure thats how you spell it) was the right color and the right temperature. Because the rice was non existent, it was very much just a soup. There was absolutely nothing special. While it did have a nice spice, it fell short of a True outstanding Gumbo. It was acceptable at best. Moving on to the Fish Tacos. Quite a nice balance of refreshing contrast to the rest of the dishes and the shells were exceptional. The Jambalaya was really good. Great balance of spice. It felt authentic and I would recommend this one. The Ettoufe not only was over salted, it was not a traditional Ettoufe by any stretch. The tomatoes rather than the seafood was the star of this show. This was the big let down that would make me question returning.",

My husband remembered loving the double-cut pork chop and his mouth was watering for it again!  He wasn't disappointed!  It is the best, juiciest pork chop he's had in his life.  I got the steak which came served on a plank of wood that it was grilled with for extra flavor.  It was delicious, and I will order that again.  Our friends each got the BBQ salmon dish and said it was to die for.  The portions are a generous size as well.  Although all of us were stuffed, we ended our meal with Emeril's famous banana cream pie that we all shared.  It's a giant slice and is out of this world!  Even if you think you can't eat another bite, order this for dessert! The service was great, the decor was contemporary and pretty, the prices were reasonable compared to other restaurants of that caliber.  And the food was all we'd hoped for!  It's on our A-list for next year's Vegas trip for sure!",
