I think it's completely ridiculous that because I warned future patrons about cash payments that I am asked not to come in.  I still stated the food was delicious but because I'm using Yelp as Yelp is to be used I am no longer welcome which is fine by us!  After so many trips and inconsistency we all are fed up anyway!   After every visit where we used cash payment we loved the food so much we decided against cash payment and just paying with a card but this is bonkers!   Attached is photo of message from owner!",

If you're vegetarian this is a great place to go with your omnivorous friends. Excellent service as well...",

I ordered the Salmon as the entree, and when it arrived to the table it looked incredible, but upon taking the first bite I was surprised to find out it was frozen and not fresh salmon.  For anyone who eats fish, the difference between frozen and fresh fish is night and day.  It was dry, hard, and just awful.  The waiter came over and asked how everything was.  I told him I cant believe for this price, you would serve frozen fish.  His reply was.... Yes, the fish here is frozen.  So def won't be coming back to this low quality spot ever again.  $17 for frozen fish is a joke.",

I ordered the starter mini Meze (\"Mini Mees\"?) selection, which included some of the best hummus, baba ghanoush, and loubieh I've tasted.  The Lentil soup was average--I added some tabbouleh to liven it up.  I had their Mint Lemonade--and that was exotic and delightfully refreshing.  The pre-main course fare had me hooked already.    For the entree, I got the Chicken Shwarma plate with rice, tahini, and a jalepeno mint sauce.  It was pretty mouth-watering and tasty.  There portion was generous, enough for two meals, so I took a doggy bag home for another meal.  I didn't have dessert, but next time I'll try the Shabiet: filo pastry stuffed with milk custard and topped with pistachios and honey. (I can't wait!)",

It just relocated to Village Square (great for date night movie and dinner:). I've loved all the items ordered (salads, Chicken Schawarma, etc) as they are very well flavored, meat is super tender. Staff have been friendly. Four stars for now, as I'll see how I like the new location and update later.  Update to my review dining on site for date night with my hubbie: 5 stars! Great service at new location  (staff are friendly, professional, courteous, and prompt), food is still extremely flavorful and tasty, dining in allowed for the plate of fresh hot bread. Enough food that there are leftovers for later..yumm. Music lightly playing sets a welcoming atmosphere...just upbeat enough to bring a smile, but mellow enough to feel peaceful. Yaay!",

Not only does it remind me of home, but possibly is even better than what I grew up knowing was the best place in town. (The grape leaves rival my grandma's, but I'll never tell her that) Khourys is family owned and has a great hospitable vibe. The hummus and homemade cracked wheat pita bread is amazingly dangerous. I have to control myself so I have room for the rest of the meal! Everything is fresh and healthy, not greasy I've been a regular for years and even though Khourys has moved a little farther away from me, I will still make the drive to get my fix. It's worth it!",

If you like baklava, you must try Khoury's version because they have perfected it! The perfect balance of philo, honey and pistachio. They roll them, which makes for an amazing consistency and crispy texture you don't get from the triangle baklava.   Everything from their simple salad that is dressed in a light and bright citrus dressing to my favorite favorite: jalapeno hummus and veggie dolmades. Their grilled marinated protein have never disappointed me. Every single one I have tasted I have loved! I wake up craving this place. I am craving it now!!!  I have used their catering/delivery over the past 3 years and they are so easy to work with and very professional. LOVE this place. Thank you for your excellence!",

There are quite a few options in the area, but my Husband absolutely loves Mediterranean food. I looked at their menu online and we were quickly sold when we saw their 4 course menu for 2 people for $42.  We started with jalapeno hummus, which was really delicious. Then I had the house salad and my Hubby had the greek salad. Their house dressing is so good! We both ended up getting the gyro platter and were definitely not disappointed. Everything was piping hot and obviously very fresh. The portions were huge and everything (especially the rice!) was really yummy. We shared dessert (I don't remember the name, but it was different and very good).  Our server was very helpful and friendly. I got a glass of wine and my hubs had an iced tea and our total bill was less than $50. Overall, we were really impressed and found ourselves wishing they had a location closer to home in Henderson. Next time we are in the area, I definitely see us going back.",

I can't tell what spice or what it is but it's still good.  I ordered the mixed plate chicken and beef kabobs and my date ordered the parsley salad.

They serve their homemade baked bread hot and savory however it turns cold right away. I wonder why. Don't let the bread go cold, eat it right away with a serving of hummus which is creamy and thick. They have a menu dinner for two with appetizer, entree, soup and dessert. It's a fair enough portion not the regular serving. It was our best choice. I tasted the beef and rice soup and it's unappealing, I prefer the lentil soup.   The chicken kabob was satisfying. It wasn't dry. The rice was just perfect I was surprised that I even though I was hungry and the food was delicious, I still didn't finish my plate. I guess I got full right away. The 2 skewer kabob filled my empty stomach. My son always love the Gyro sandwich. I asked for some chili sauce and they gave me a fresh minced jalapeno and it's quite spicy. I enjoyed it with my chicken kabob.",

Fresh, top-notch ingredients stand out in every dish. Tabbouleh is made as it should be made, with abundant parsley, mint and lemon with just enough bulgur to soak up the tangy, refreshing  dressing. The tabbouleh & hummus are worth the trip alone, as are the fresh from the oven pillows of pita served with olive oil & za'atar  for dipping.   You won't go wrong with any of the beef or lamb dishes, but vegetarians won't feel like second class citizens here. The extensive menu has everything one expects to find in a Mediterranean restaurant plus a few wonderful surprises.  Everything is profoundly fresh, tasty and nicely presented.  Service might be an issue during prime time dining hours, but on a recent late Friday afternoon, our server, Irvin was right on point. But when food is as outstanding as it is here, don't worry about it.  The food is THAT good.",

Dounya(I think that was her name) was the sweetest, very attentive, and super accommodating to my little ones. You could tell they could've used a couple hands as we waited a bit for her to come around and what not but it definitely wasn't her slacking; again total disclosure it was Mother's Day at 6:00 and it would not discourage me from showing up there for dinner at the slightest.

I had to go to the front to pay my check. I asked to speak to a manager and the servers stated that there wasn't one available & that they didn't know when one would be in. This was my first time here & was extremely disappointed. I expected much more from Middle Eastern restaurant.",

The chicken was baked tender on the inside crispy on the outside served with a piece of broccoli.   For dessert we shared the rice pudding that was just meh, ok not too sweet and sprinkled with crumbled pistachios.",

I yelped Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant and the reviews were not only positive, there were tons of them!  I emailed Khoury's a \"pre-order\" list and when I followed up with a phone call, I was able to get the pricing right away.  There wasn't any beating around the bush so that was helpful.  We connected the day of the order to confirm the delivery, which was awesome.  The food was delivered on time, the gal that delivered the food even helped us carry the food to the 2nd level.  We would definitely eat at Khoury's again!  We ordered the family catering of chicken, falafel, rice and salad.  The Falafel was a bit dry but everything else was so good!",

    "text": "There was another review on here that said it best: 3 strikes out. We keep trying this place because the food is excellent (particularly their jalapeno hummus), but there is now little reason for us to come back. The service is terrible. Yesterday, there was only one waitress and at least 5-6 bussers, so you can imagine how thin her service was stretched. There were people trying to get her attention all around, so I felt for her. I understand that sometimes restaurants are understaffed. When she finally got around to us and took our order, we ordered the Shawarma Plate with Gyro meat, which we have ordered 2-3 times before with no problems.  When our food was brought out, it was chicken instead of gyro meat. We left it untouched and waited almost 10 minutes for the waitress to come check on us, and we let her know that our order was wrong. She spoke to me in a condescending voice and said that Shawarma is chicken, explained to me what gyro meat is (which I know), and we should have ordered the Gyro Plate. According to the menu, the Shawarma Plate can be \"lamb, chicken, OR gyro.\" She didn't really acknowledge it as her mistake, even when we showed her in print that the menu says \"or Gyro.\" When she brought out our correct order, she apologized and loudly exclaimed \"Here is your GYRO PLATE.\" Well, there is no Gyro Plate on the menu, and I will reiterate that Khoury's Shawarma Plate advertises Gyro as one of the meat options. On top of all that, she never brought us drink refills after promising to do so, and I watched her bring drinks to other tables in the meantime.  Until they get their customer service together, which has been deplorable on previous visits as well, we will not be returning. It's really a shame because their food is so tasty, but I do not appreciate being talked down to when the waitress took our order down incorrectly.",

Not joking when I say it took 25 min to get a drink or a refill & around 45 min for food. I used to make the drive to eat there, but I will spend my time & money elsewhere now. Side note: I have also used Khoury's for catering in the past, but now I must say I'm hesitant to do any business with them. Side note #2: My boyfriend is pissed I'm leaving even 2 stars lol",

And on the rare occasion I had to come in and out for lunch, I informed the waiter who made sure it came out in a few minutes, and I was on time for my meeting.   Tips for eating out: Chill out. Enjoy the experience. Talk to your dinner date. Stay off your phone. Have fun. Don't rush! You wont believe how much you will enjoy your meal. Try it...you might just love it.",

The Mtabal Baba Bhanoush ($8.50) is basically grilled eggplant mashed with garlic, lemon and sesame oil served with fresh baked pita bread.  The Pita Bread here is delicious, we recieved a basket of hot and puffy pita with the appetizer.  I had the Lamb Shawarma Plate ($16.50) and it was served with VERY generous portions of sliced grilled lamb and rice, also included tomatoes, onions, pickles and shawarma sauce. The shawarma sauce is listed on menu as a Tahini sauce, it was very creamy tahini.  The entire meal was very delicious and flavorful.    The menu has a lot to choose from and includes a large variety of gluten free and vegetarian dishes. I'll be back to try a few other items including their salad and kabob menus.",

Once we were seated the owner, Fanny, came right over to say hi, and to check in. Quickly and cheerfully letting us know the restaurants history (they were 10 years in another location), a few menu highlights, and to take drink orders.  I took Fanny's recommendation and had the homemade beer sausage in a bright lemon sauce. The yummy dish has a citrus pop for sure, but I totally loved the contrast of the earthy sausage and the lemon sauce! It was really different and yummy!   Next time I think I am going to try a table full of apps, they looked amazing too! It was hard to decide, with so many great choices!  Can't wait to walk on over again soon!",

Driver was also waiting quite a while. I love their food but I will definitely not order to go from Khouris. I could have sat down in the restaurant and ordered the food and received it faster than this. Super disappointed. Not sure I'll even come back to eat in the restaurant.",

I just left the restaurant the owner was standing in front and as I walked up to get my check after sitting there for 20 minutes completely unattended he asked me if I was there to pick up a to-go order?  Again, good food but not good enough to warrant the horrible service that I have experienced!  This was was my fourth and last visit!",

    "text": "A good Tabbouleh salad tells the heart and soul of whose in the kitchen.  Today it was not the owner(s), and if it was gees too bad.  The salad was presented on a bed of romaine leaves, which is okay and acts as a filler from plate up.  The salad was by no means how they pictured it on the Mezza pictures.        There was hardly a breath of crack wheat used, a fine grind can make it hard to find in a salad, and tomatoes were finely chopped but covered by what looked liked grass clippings(parsley). The dressing had just a hint of lemon.  They serve sliced lemon with the plate to kick up the lemon flavoring if you like.  The bread served, was not fresh and already began drying out.       I took the olive oil and zartar spice for dipping the bread and poured it over the tabbouleh which helped with some well needed table salt made it far more enjoyable. (Hedary's down the street does a way better tabbouleh that comes out ready flavored and does have cracked wheat that can be seen.  I think they use a medium grind.).      Khoury's  recipe is certainly unique in that I found no mint nor cucumber nor green onion. The cost for this bowl, was $9.95 a little pricey for what's not in it.  I have made Tabbouleh a zillion times and can state for $9.95 you can make a HUGE bowl to feed a lot of people.  Today I just did not want to make a Huge bowl and left the work to some where else and can say it was a disappointing adventure.       There is a lot of staff working there and I think probably a big overhead shifted to the food costs is why something so inexpensive to make is pricey...I overheard a waiter tell some guests that a shot of Vodka for their drink was $8.00 and I'm thinking well vodka for $8.00 a bit much???...Oh well...The life of Lebanese food in this town will one day fall into the right hands and we will have a champion that will offer value,flavor and hope in this desert town!  I will go back one day, but not in the near future.",

Give it a few minutes and let the loaves cool down; then dig in. You're welcome. Since every Lebanese person is an expert at critiquing Lebanese food (and basically everything else) you can trust me on this, you won't be disappointed. My wife gambled on the kafta and I placed my wager on the chicken shawerma sandwich. Both of them paid off big. Of COURSE I had some of her food, are you kidding me? Their rice is made just like mom makes it, and they're accurate with the amounts of spices, especially sumac. Did I mention the fresh, made to order pita bread? What're you waiting for?!

    "text": "Since our former neighbors worked there, my partner suggested that we give them a shot the first time, while they were in the old location. When we did, the food was outstanding, very reminiscent of a small chain of places we used to frequent back in Arlington, Virginia, called Lebanese Taverna.  Alas, although the food was more than up to snuff, the service left a lot to be desired.  Not so for our 'return' to the new location, I am happy to report. And the food hasn't taken even the slightest dip in quality. It's always a thrill to be able to sit sipping wine or some other drinks, and watch while the out-of-this-world fresh pita bread is made, rolled out and baked in their wood-fired stone oven, and then served hot with oil and spices. Surpassed only when you dip it into the tasty hummus, baba ganoush and cucumber-and-yogurt mix that we could just have as a meal unto itself. But then there would be no room for the spinach Ftayir or the Samboosak, both highly recommended apps.  Our last trip for the main course, Bear had the Meat Combo, while I opted for the Lebanese Sandwich (aka \"Lahm Bi Ajeen\"), which was a pleasant surprise. It certainly changed my expectations of what a sandwich can be, or what as an American, I am used to seeing - heavy with meat and some veggies and lots of condiments. This was airy, light and plenty flavorful with ground lamb, spices and the fresh tomatoes and chopped onions. I would have it again in a heartbeat.  As a matter of fact, I have even suggested that we could now make it a habit of coming back to Khoury's at least twice a month on a regular basis. The food, though healthy as all get-out for you, doesn't taste like 'diet' food, and it's satisfying, but doesn't leave you feeling bloated. I wasn't surprised to see the number of people coming in just for take-out orders. If they were closer to us (we're in Summerlin), I have no doubt we'd do a lot more business with them, than just ordering burgers or pizza.  Whenever you're in the Village Square vicinity, I would enthusiastically recommend checking them out! Two thumbs WAY UP from this guy!",

    "text": "Everything fantastic! I must start but saying the are two types of kibbi, in Lebanese cuisine, one cooked and one raw. I have enjoyed the cooked version at many restaurants, but never found the raw version, in Las Vegas. I was excited to find kibbi-nayi, the raw version, on their menu. I ordered it, without hesitation, along with samboosak as my appetizer. The server asked me if I was aware that it was raw and I assured her that I had been seeking out this dish for a while -- and that I had high expectations.   I was served two, fresh out of the oven, pitas accompanied with a plate of Lebanese olive oil and dried herbs. (I don't remember if they came before or after I ordered but it was incredibly hard not to eat them both before but food arrived. I didn't want to fill up on bread, but damn, it was great!) Next my samboosak arrived. Five mini pastries filled with lamb, onions arms almonds. They exceeded my expectations!   When my kibbi-nayi arrived, it was served with an assortment of olives, pickles, pickled beets, radishes and other assorted vegetables. My server informed me that I could use the veggies or the pita bread to dip into the kibbi. She also asked if I wanted more pita bread. I told her that I was interested in something more neutral, since the fresh pita bread was so flavorful that it might distract from the flavor of the kibbi. She returned with some toasted (or possibly dried) pita chips.   Wow. This was truly an epicurean delight! I've had steak tartare many times on my life and I thought raw lamb might be similar. Nope. This was an experience all to its own. Delicate, perfectly balanced flavor with a wonderful texture. The pickled beets were my favorite but everything, on which I spread the kibbi,  was amazing!   I was stuffed. When my server (I'm sorry I can't remember her name) asked if I was interested in dessert, I asked about the shabiet.  \"It's a little bit of heaven,\" she replied.   She was not wrong. Flaky pastry, filled with custard, topped with crushed pistachios and a light honey sauce. Most importantly, not too sweet!   A wonderfully experience, overall, and the iced tea was damn good too! I've been back five times, since my first experience in mid December, and will be back again! I even bought a gallon of their Lebanese olive oil.   If raw lamb is not your thing, try the gyro or shawarma sandwiches. The lahm bi ajeen is also great.   On my last trip, I wanted to try the kousa,  squash stuffed with lamb. I was told that they no longer make it. It says, on the menu, that it is a seasonal dish so I hope that they will make it again, in the future.  If you enjoy Mediterranean food, I highly recommend this place. Even if you don't, I still recommend it!",

Plus I ordered the veggie stuffed grape leaves (which I often have on the Fatoosh. It's a yummy combo.) These are the best stuffed grape leaves I've ever had...they have a nice spicy kick. I ate my fill when I got home, and still have plenty for another meal tomorrow. Oh... and the pita is divine. I love this place!!! And I have to mention this...the sumac...the spice.

Good for dates or causal dinner with a friend. Must try their freshly baked pita bread!  So, I tried the Lentil soup and a Lamb Sharawarma walnut salad, which is basically sliced tender lamb combined with feta walnuts, lemon and peeper. The lentil soup is absolutely delicious and I found myself satisfied with this dish alone. The salad was bigger than I thought it would be, it was good, but not sure I would opt for the lamb walnut salad, maybe next time I'll try chicken. I ordered a glass of Sangria, well made, not sweet or strong, just perfect!   They have happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6. There's never been a wait and they have spacious seating. I'm definitely making this place a regular.",

Now I wish I hadn't!  The restaurant was not busy at all so firstly we were surprised that the service just wasn't up to scratch. Our server didn't particularly seem to be interested in serving us and through the night some items where just forgotten about and we had to remind her.  My friend ordered the kabob. It came out burnt. The veggies and the steak where charred and she had to return it. Myself and two other friends ordered the gyro sandwich but unfortunately it wasn't served in a pocketless pitta as it should be. It was in a wrap. Non of us where overly impressed. I would say the best part was the feta fries... Disappointing visit.",

When I got seated with my family, they first miscounted how many napkins to bring, then plates. The hummus/pita and dolma that we ordered for appetizer actually came before the much needed plates. I ordered the sujuk (spicy sausage) for the main entree, which is something I don't see too often on the menu of a Greek restaurant. Irvin, our 2nd server, was actually very attentive and helpful. He definitely saved our dinner from the poor service we received at the beginning.   I'll have to say though, the dessert sealed the deal! Baklava sundae with homemade rice pudding... YUM",

The fresh pita bread they put hot on the table. Next was a complimentary salad had a vegetarian pizza which is outstanding and of course my all-time favorite the Farooj chicken with garlic parsley lemon potatoes carrots and broccoli melt-in-your-mouth with Chris penis one of my favorite dishes of all time love this place please try it when you're in Vegas.",

We were seated almost immediately, the restaurant was busy but far from being at capacity. We were told who our server would be, but then nothing to the point we were about to leave. Nevertheless, eventually the food came and it was outstanding. I had the chicken kabob. It comes on a bed of rice, which may be the best part. Fluffy and very tasty. The puffy bread is fresh, you can watch it being made, and comes with an olive oil oil and herb plate for dipping. It was very good but even though they have outstanding food the inattentive service gets them 3 stars.",

I love the food at Khoury's, but I'm afraid I'll take my business elsewhere. Hummus Factory up the street on Sahara is amazing. While they also get backed-up, they estimate the correct pick-up time and are always apologetic when they are busy.  Such a shame.",

They actually have the proper garlic sauce here that is supposed to be served with the chicken shawarma.  The grape leaves and hummus were excellent. The fattoush could have had more pita in it, but it was good. The chicken shawarma was excellent. It was perfectly seasoned.  I definitely will be back. If you like Lebanese food then come try this place. I definitely recommend that you try the shawarma. Good eats!! They also make the pita bread fresh in an oven that you can view from the dining room. Hot and fresh.  I will try the raw kibbie on my next visit and update my review.",

The food is fresh and delicious, and the customer service is ALWAYS on point. The jalapeno hummus is always a must to order, with the Khoury's salad. The pita bread is warm, fresh, and HIGHLY addicting. I go through periods where I take a break from eating meat so this is a great place for vegan and vegetarian dishes like the falafel, manakeesh, or veggie pizza (no cheese). But for times when I am craving meat, the filet mignon beef kabobs I nearly dream about. They also have bomb feta fries as well as regular fries.   Side note: I've only been once, but they have a fantastic happy hour mon-fri from 3-6pm $5 wine/sangria (best sangria ive had, strong in a good way) and $2 beers and $3-$6 bites",

She asked if I was here to pick up food like as if I was there for some kind of a delivery service or something like that. When she found out I wasn't she had was all smiles and I find that absolutely in comprehensible. I had to explain to her that people that might do deliveries could actually be customers to so how you greet everybody matters.

First of all, the server was overwhelmed and, of course, the service was very slow and inept.....not the server's fault. She was working very hard given her circumstances. Despite the slow service, we had a great time(I'll get to the food later). We watched this scruffy middle aged man, in shorts and Tee shirt, smooch some famliar tables. We hilariously determined that he was the owner/manager....great entertainment!!!! So...the food... I would have not taken the time to write this review if I wasn't embarrassed by my recommendation and if our Lamb Shawarma tasted as I experienced on our previous visits. My Lamb Shawarma could only be described as Lamb Jerky, Rice, and Tomatoes... I really like Lebanese food and would hope this restaurant makes it; but get the old guy with the shorts into the kitchen!!!!",

The restaurant is certainly pretty and there is truly not a bad table in the place.  They are thoughtfully spaced so that a private conversation is possible.  The service is also excellent.  Our server, Fanie, was very pleasant and seemed genuinely committed to our needs.  The cuisine was excellent and fresher than fresh.  I always measure a Mediterranean restaurant by its hummus and pita bread.  We started with the Jalapeno Hummus which was creamy and flavorful.  It was not hot, but had just the right touch of jalapeno.  The pita was light and puffy.  We also shared a Lebanese salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions, lightly dressed in a minty lemon juice dressing.  It was very fresh and as good as it was on its own, would be a perfect accompaniment to any of the entrees.  We shared a Lebanese sandwich of ground lamb and spices.  It had an interesting savory sweet flavor going on and was quite delicious. The fries were very tasty, too.  Finally, Fanie treated us to an order of baklava.  As full as I was, this was the perfect ending to our meal.  It was sweet but not overly so.  Khoury's is a winner and its new location in a Village Square means that we will be frequent diners!",

The baba ganoush appetizer was superb, as was the lentil soup.The lamb with hummus was very nicely done as well. It was a good amount for a lunch item. Our server, Kymiah, was amazing, superb and flawless. She greeted us with a smile, was very attentive, conscientious and highly professional from start to finish while busy working other tables. It goes a long way when an establishment has employees like her. All I know is, there were a lot of flavors to go along with the perfectly prepared food. Kudos to the kitchen and owners. Well done! (The only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the fact that there were a number of tables that were not cleared off after the diners were long gone. Half eaten food sitting on tables is not an appetizing sight).",

It was Lebanese style.Our server was Dejan; Day-'An and he was a nice guy.   He was attentative with our food, water, dessert, all the dressings that went along.   I ordered the beef with rice but asked him if the chef can make it half and half. The tahini sauce was amazing when drizzled on the meat and rice\"Sure!\"  Dejan made it happen for me.   The pita bread with olive oil is so fresh, yum.  He even got a side of hummus and it was the best that we have tried thus far.   My girlfriend had a side of fried goat cheese with the tomatoes and cucumber which went well with the side of seasoned olive oil.  Her main dish was chicken shish kabob which had a strong flavor of lemon  and oregano with long grain rice.  To finish our night we had the rice pudding sprinkled with crushed pistachios on top, it was nicely chilled and milky sweet.   We couldn't finish our main dishes so we had two to go boxes and made an awesome lunch the next day after two minutes in the microwave.   If we are in Sahara and Rampart in the Village Square and craving for Lebanese food we're there at Khoury's Mediterranean.",

    "text": "Eating here took me back in time, to when I spent 2yrs in the Middle East!   The Good: Menu choices! Right down to Beverages, especially non-alcoholic Bev's. I'm talking about Mint Lemonade and a variety of hot teas plus Turkish Coffee! We got a Mint Lemonade and I was instantly transferred back to Kuwait. They brought out some puffy bread with some Olive Oil and Cracked Peppers- delicious!! The quality of the food was great!! The Khourys Salad, was just as tangy from Lemon juice, as I hoped!! My husband got the Fattouch salad with Gyro Meat- he LOVED IT! I ordered the Combo Kabob plate. This was evening, **which matters because portion & price change for Lunch and dinner**  The Negative: Why am I deducting a star? For one, the menu stated that the lunch serving size for kabobs were 2, dinner was 3 with the choice of Salad or Soup. I was looking forward to getting Tabouleh salad. But it was about $2 extra to switch the salad option. I thought I had a choice, but apparently you only get a choice for lunch. The Combo Kabob plate gives you 3 skewers of your choice of meat ($21.95 for Dinner), yet when I asked for 1 skewer to be the Lamb, it was a $2 upgrade. When I finally got my dish, the rice was cold. But that didn't bother me so much because I wasn't going to completely eat all the rice. What DID bother me, was that for $23 I got 3 skewers (Chicken, Beef, Lamb) with only 3 small to medium chunks of meat, with grilled veggies in between. Only 3 pieces of meat per skewer! I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants and all their skewers were filled with meat and the grilled veggies (onion, tomatoes, peppers) were on the side WITH HUMMUS. This dish did not come with Hummus, they did add a small amount of Cucumber Yogurt dip (which was tasty). Honestly, for a $23 diah, there should be leftovers of meat. There wasn't. They trick your eyes by putting veggies in between. The food itself was delicious. We also ordered fries on the side- because learning this was a Lebanese restaurant, we have had the BEST french fries in Lebanon! But these were disappointing. They were limp, no crispiness whatsoever. Their Garlic Sauce was on point though! As far as Ambiance goes, i felt it was too bright in there and also that they seat you very close to other people. They probably want to deal with one area, but I could literally hear the conversation at the table next to us while the rest of the place was empty (cuz this was around 10pm).   But I would definitely be back and would take advantage of their happy hour or lunch menu. But I would not order the Kebab Combo plate for dinner again, Because the portion size does not justify the cost.  Service was good. Loved the music.",

So then we asked to speak to the manager, but the owner/manager didn't come talk to us; they sent over the hostess that sat us & they didn't do anything to make up for it. Really unprofessional place.   I really enjoyed the food & it was a decent price, but had to write about our experience.

But today, I got seated outdoors and was left outside for 25 minutes. Not a single person came out to give us water or take our orders, they completely forgot about us despite several of them making eye contact with us through the window. Needless to say that we left because it was very agitating and rude.   Sadly today however, I wasn't able to enjoy the food. However, the fresh pita bread is absolutely delicious especially with the jalapeno hummus or the olive oil and seasoning they give you. I recommend the kafta or the chicken kabob plates. Those are my go to meals when I come here usually.",

    "text": "I always have a soft spot for Mediterranean food, but this was my first time eating Lebanese style. Absolutely loved the family style ambience here, but also how incredibly busy they can be. They started our table off with pita bread and olive oil, only the pita was humongous! They are freshly baked near the front counter as well. Just as the ambience, the kafte and shawarma platters also seemed family-style; so many portions! The meat was so tender and delicious, definitely try their gyro. We ended our meals with baklava rolls and Mediterranean coffee, which was the perfect blend of sweet and fragrant.   Would've rated 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow, almost disregarded service from our waiter. We waited for our entrees for a good half an hour as well, don't know if that was the kitchen's fault but it was hard to enjoy anything before our meals arrived.",

    "text": "We came here because it was convenient, having just walked out of Settebello a few doors away.  Because we had already had drinks and a taste of the awful pizza there, we weren't all that hungry, so we decided to stick with shawarma sandwiches - lamb for me, chicken for Mr. Cluck, 9.95 each.  Even so, we were served a basket of warm, puffy pita with some olive oil/balsamic for dipping.  Our server was Simi, a delightful young woman from Israel, who couldn't have been nicer, and didn't betray any annoyance that we were ordering so little.      I loved that we were able to substitute salad, rice or broccoli at no extra charge, and we both went with salad.  It was a large portion, but simple - just romaine, tomato, cucumber and some seasoning, accompanied by a lemony vinaigrette.  The sandwiches were excellent, and we were given cups of extra tahini to put on them.  The pita had that extra bit of crispness around the edges that makes a sandwich great, and we both enjoyed our meals.  Khoury's is a large place, with cloth napkins and tablecloths covered with paper.  Only the lighting - too much, in my opinion - prevents me from thinking of this as an upscale place.  A little dimness would add megawatts to the atmosphere.  When one door closes, another opens.  In this case, you can take that literally.",

Also, their babaganoush is some of the best we've had around town also. Overall a phenomenal place for friends and family....did I mention you've got to try their gyro meat?!",

Also, I love that they have bellydancing music playing in the background with a mixture of some pop & traditional music as well. Love their veggie kabobs, bread (delish!

    "text": "I have been to Khoury's only a few times. The food is alright. I would come here more for convenience. As of the date of this review, I made an order over the phone about 20 minutes before I arrived. I literally left their restaurant a little while ago feeling very irritated. I walk in. Stand by the counter. Waiting for a server or someone to come up to me. Nope. I stood there for about ten minutes. I even looked at my watch when I stepped inside. For whatever reason I thought, \"Let me see how long this takes.\" Three employees were walking back and forth near me. No one says a word. No acknowledgement. Nothing. Which evidently, has been an issue with other reviewers on here. Normally I'd say something, but I was curious to see if anyone would, well, do their job of assisting a customer. They're weren't slammed with customers. There were folks sitting at tables, but nothing crazy. I run my own business. The first thing I would want any employee to say to a guest is, \"Hi sir/mam. Welcome. Have you been helped yet?\" You just want to make sure the customer has been tended to. I don't understand what's so difficult about that. As I said earlier, I find their food to be alright. It's on the pricier side, and the portions are a bit smaller than what I'm accustomed to with other restaurants. I hope a manager or someone sees this review. Because the last thing I would want for my own business is an employee's lack of customer service losing me business.",

However, ever since they moved locations...it has been a nightmare. I've have dined in and have done take out...the last time I dined in with my family was a few months ago-there were 5 of us and the restaurant was dead. It took 20 minutes to take our order. 15 minutes for the drinks to come, and over an hour for the food.  They have amazing pita bread and the waitress was unwilling to bring more as we were waiting for our food. Overall, a terrible dining experience.  Today I called in an order...she told me 25 minutes. I waited 30 minutes before I left the house thinking it would be ready. I got there and she said the food was ready but she just needed to bag the bread.  Well 30 minutes later she accomplished bagging the bread and all of the food was cold. The fries were cold and no microwave could revive them. No apologies, nothing. The back up for carry out was atrocious behind me.  I wish the 5 people behind me the best of luck. Hopefully they didn't order the fries.  Also a man in front of me obviously had surgery on his foot...the girl came out balancing multiple bags of pita bread to transfer to him for a balancing act....and then asks, \"would you like a bag?\" I didn't think she would have to ask, in fact she should have offered to take it to his car-idiotic",

I've eaten a lot of Lebanese food in  my life and it's my favourite kind.  My only complaint is their system doesn't always seem to sync up - I order from them at least once a week and although I always ask for no pickles on my chicken shawarma half the time it come with pickles. Even if the box has writing on it saying no pickles! I also regularly ask for a side of garlic sauce and again 50/50 if that happens. Not the end of the world even with these issues there is no where better for this food in the city.",

They also have complimentary freshly baked pita bread that is delish with an olive oil and spice dip.   I ordered the Greek salad for my main meal since I was so full already, but it was so so. The dressing wasn't the best   I would go back though. Definitely recommend it",

I ordered the mezza plate and got to taste everything. It was great! Baklava for desert. The only complaint is the service was slow just because they were soooooo busy, but it was so good I ordered more food to go.",

My mom and I ordered feta fries, veggie pizza, and hummus with pita bread. The pita bread and hummus came out first, we wanted that as our appetizer. The hummus is good, and the pita bread is amazing. Then the feta fries came out. The feta fries were good, but there was a lot of the sauce on there, it kind of made the fries cold and soggy, but it was still a good dish. Our pizza came out almost 10-15 minutes after the fries. We got so full on fries, we tried a piece of the pizza. The pizza was just ok, it was nothing special, but it's Mediterranean food, not a pizza place. The services was just ok, it could have been better, but it wasn't horrible. Overall this place was good, but I've had better.",

They had beautiful puffed pitas as well that were amazing. If you like lamb this is a great place to get it. The lamb kabobs were amazing as well as the lamb gyro. Lastly the baklava was nice and flaky. It wasn't soggy and was very traditional but also was topped with pistachios. This was amazing. We will definitely be back thank you for this amazing food!!!",

It was only half full of patrons when we arrived and no person to greet us.  We sat in front of the window & waited again. Then the menus came & we said we weren't quite ready.  But 15 mins. later we finally flagged a busboy down & asked for more olive oil/Zatar for dipping our puffy bread, as 1 little plate wasn't much for 3 people.  He took our order of  Shawarma (w/rice), Moussaka (w/salad) & Kofte kebab (w/salad & rice.)    We waited 45 mins. for our orders & no manager or owner came to apologize or make good.  One friend's Shawarma was fine she said.  The other friend ordered her Kofte well done & it was burnt black.  My Moussaka was total mush.  Yes, mush.  Like, is there any eggplant under there?  Our salads were just lettuce, pieces of very unripe tomatoes & a boring dressing.  We had to ask for more bread because the other had gotten cold.  The only reason I didn't send mine back was due to hunger pangs & that it could well take an hour.  Now, could anything else go wrong here? I shall never, for any event or person, return to Khoury's restaurant.  They don't deserve my patronage & that's too bad because it's right in my neighborhood.",

Changing the rating to 4.  ========================// This post was in 2017  3 strikes out as they say..   Not coming back until they get their act together. In my opinion , the place, needs better management.  This was the last chance I am giving this place and had no choice but to walk out again.  4  unclean tables outside and we wait for 10 minutes without water service..   I gave this place another chance after the previous 2 \"not so great\" experiences..  I waited at the counter for 10 minutes and no one paid attention. The servers were all in the kitchen and one of them saw me and chose to ignore me. I walked out...The previous time, it was a takeaway order which was completely messed up..  I know the place can do better with good service... I wish them luck!",

The fresh pita bread that magically rises into fluffy soft pillows is beyond words. Sometimes servers don't come back to the table often enough to refill drinks, etc but overall the service is good. The lights could also be dimmed a bit during dinner service. It's super bright which doesn't make for ideal ambiance. But honestly those are small potatoes.

It was a deliciously baked puff with olive oil and fresh herbs. They make it in house so it's nice and fresh. I got the feta fries and a Lebanese street food option with lamb. The meat was earthy and full of good flavor. Similar to a moussaka taste. My BF got the gyro and said it was alright. When the feta fries came out they were entirely soaked with the sauce and almost to the point of inedible (my tip is to not order them or order the sauce on the side). Our waitress was kind enough to offer regular fries and took them off our bill since I didn't like them. For Mediterranean food, trying something different was good. But probably should explore other things on the menu.",

Very rarely do middle eastern restaurants continue this tradition. Also, the kabobs have the most wonderful flavors that make Khourys unique. My go to is the chicken kabob with a side of baba ghanouj. I love their baba especially because it includes picked vegetables.  Lastly, the baklava is delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed!",

Just if you order take out make sure to tell them to put condiments. Last time I picked up we had so much fries not even 1 ketchup . And we weren't eating at home, so was a bummer. And there's another cool thing they have on the menu.  They have doh for the kids to make bread or pizza, or just play. It's just $1 extra but entertains the kids, and they even cook it for you to take home! So much fun!",

And, they happily substituted broccoli for the rice. The seasoning was exquisite.   OMG Yes to the Grass-Fed Lamb Tenderloin Kabob.   Plus, our waiter Dounya was one of a kind. More than just pleasant. Very kind soul. Also, she told us about the Vote Special which was a wonderful gift. We got to enjoy a free appetizer with it.   We enjoyed it so much we came back 3 days later for a second time. Yum!",

No romaine  The mezze is a great option since you can try a little bit of everything. I ordered the Greek fries to go and it went soggy. Still good but I will advise you to put the sauce on the side of to go order and warm the fries in the oven when home",

The bread they serve with the food is amazing, and it pairs well with all the dips in the house Mezza appetizer. The meat combination plate was a little different, most of the meats were heavily seasoned with spices. But the basmati rice was delicious.  For dessert we ordered the kanafi which is shredded pastry and sweet cheese topped with honey and pistachios. If you love cheese then this is definitely a dish you should try! I don't know too many Mediterranean places in Vegas that serve this but it's so good!!",

We devoured every bite of it. Steak was so tasty and tender. Rice is good as well.   Also, it's worth asking for their pita bread.   I highly recommended their sangria, very refreshing! They have a big wine list and few options for cocktails.   We were too full that we didn't get to the dessert part but I intend to try their chocolate baklava next time.  I would say prices are reasonable as the servings are huge. They also have lunch and happy hour menus.  Our server was quite busy and barely around but other than that, I definitely see myself coming back here again.",

    "text": "I know I have reviewed this place before and gave it 5 stars. Not sure why it's missing-- so this is considered my \"updated\" review. This used to be our favorite Mediterranean restaurant and I will never return.   Brought the 84 year old mother in law for her birthday and were treated like crap. When we came in we jokingly asked the waiter if we could have the happy hour sangria pitcher. We knew they did not have happy hour on Sunday but hey, it never hurts to ask and we were celebrating an 84 birthday. The waiter seemed annoyed and can back a few minutes later informing us that the owner said absolutely not!   Ok-- so we ordered the sangria and the cucumber dip, grape leaves, fried cheese and fatoosh salad for an appetizer. Cucumber dip had no flavor, fried cheese was cold, grape leaves looked like they were made 3 weeks ago and the salad had zero oil so it was dry as a bone and nobody liked it. We had the waiter pack it to go so I could give it to the homeless.   Dinner was kibbi for the birthday girl, chicken kabob for the bf and I got the vegan mousaka that I always get. We all ordered rice and fries with our meal.  The waiter never came back to clear the appetizer dishes and then brought out the dinner. It was a complete mess. Once that was settled we looked at our meals. The kibbi was shaped into meatballs. This was very strange as I have never seen this presented like this. We weren't sure what it was. Nothing special about the kabob. The mousaka was HORRIBLE and I. Hold not eat more than one bite. All 3 orders of fries were cold and also looked like they were made 3 weeks ago.   The waiter removed my meal and they had to replace the fries. What a disappointment to go to a birthday dinner and not be able to eat anything. The waiter never came back until the end to see if we needed a box. Of course we did because the food was so bad. I boxed everything up so it didn't get wasted and we gave it to a homeless man in the parking lot.   I was also shocked that they didn't even say happy birthday. Just brought the check. That was a $100 that was completely wasted. We would of had a better meal at Taco Bell. By the way-- the restaurant only had 3 tables. It was not busy, so that is not an excuse.   Not sure what happened to this place but it is not the same. Went down hill fast. It's a shame, we always looked forward to eating here. Don't waste your time or money.",

My best friend and I ordered the vegetarian sampler platter and a fattoush salad to split, and it was the perfect amount of food to share and sample.   PROS: + delicious food + fresh puffed Arabic bread + garlic sauce was bomb + large portions, perfect to share  + service was on point  CONS: - I wish they had one closer to where I live in Henderson  Being from Michigan, the place that has the largest Arab population in the US, it's been rather difficult to find anything that compares to the Mediterranean food there. Khoury's definitely surprised me, and I'd say is in the top 3 of my favorite Mediterranean places in Vegas. The other two yummy places are Hummus bowls and wraps (assembly line, fresh food) and Zaytoon (small Persian restaurant attached to a mini market).",

We typically order the chicken Shwarma, hummus, and babaganoush served with warm, fresh, baked in house Pita. We love their side salad and the lemon house dressing. If you order the plate it can def serve as lunch for the next day. Overall it's solid food and always consistent.   The only negative is it is a bit pricey for this cuisine as dinner for two is typically around $50.",

Mediterranean is always fun, there's not a lot of these places in Las Vegas, and this one is doing everything right. I recommend the mint lemonade, which we ordered twice it was sooo refreshing. Their coffee is authentic and also available for purchase. I went home with a lbs of it because I LOOOVE Turkish style coffee and this one is perfectly spiced with cardamom",

    "text": "The food is and has always been good here, but the service has gone down tremendously since they moved locations from their previous location off of Russell which was much better. It was nicer inside and employees were on top of things.   The new location has only kids employed who really don't know how to multi-task properly, don't pre-bus (remove dirty plates) and also don't know the basic steps of service to deliver to a guest. We came here on a Monday afternoon and there were only 5 tables with guests, yet every other table in the restaurant was dirty, so we had to wait to be sat until they cleaned off a table. There was never a manager in sight.   Nevertheless, the food was good which it always has been. There are plenty of delicious Mediterranean restaurants in Vegas to choose from with much better service, so not sure if we would come to Khoury's again which is a shame because we loved going to the old one. Maybe we will try it again a year from now to see if the service has changed.",

    "text": "Don't want to jinx this, but I will be bold and write a review for this new find for my family, a Mediterranean restaurant that is not Greek or overpriced or a dive. Check, check, check.  (Not that I don't love all 3--and sometimes all in the same place.)  We have been in search for the \"neighborhood restaurant\" for some time.  A place that you can kick your heels up, and yet be casual and familiar.  The proverbial place where eventually everybody will know your name, and the food is always the same--good.  A place that won't break the bank if you go with the fam once a week.  A place that, despite all the new eateries cropping up in town like wild mushrooms in the forest, you still want to return to, even if you can't justify doing a new Yelp review.  We think we found that place.  The vibe is \"family elegant.\"  I made that up, but I think you know what I mean.  Service was attentive but not fussy.  We ordered shwarma sandwiches, succulent pieces of grilled meat on pita with sauce and vegetables.  We also tried the hummus, which was flavorful and smooth, and not overly thick.  The bread that came on the table was rough and artisanal.  You can tell that they make it in-house and it comes literally piping hot! Don't touch it right away.  And don't make the mistake of overeating it, sopping up the unctuous olive oil with herbs, leaving you less than optimal room for your meal.  (Rookie move on my part.  I know better!)  The lentil soup was KICK-&SS.  Hearty, bold, harmonious flavor.  Forget bottomless mimosas.  I want this to be a bottomless lentil soup.  Desserts were splendid.  Of course, the obligatory baklava.  But also a sundae made in-house that is a traditional Lebanese dish slightly adapted with ice cream that is a great note to end the meal and is none too sweet.  Go crazy and get the traditional mint tea to accompany it.  Actual mint leaves flavor the tea and you drink it in a glass, not a tea cup or mug.  Just like we did in the markets when I was a student abroad in Egypt.    My only quibble is how loud it is in here.  It is just, \"What did you say, Sonny?!\" all over the place.  The music is too loud (though it is good--and authentic Middle Eastern tunes).  Which in turn perhaps makes the people speak too loud.  And you just feel like you are shouting, and hearing shouting, which is not super relaxing, or the right or ideal setting to savor the very fine meal that they serve.  This is an easy fix.  If they do, I think they may be seeing a lot more of us.",

The lamb Shawarma was however so so, and the fries were saggy. One more downer, Coke was flat, so the waiter offered the smallest bottled Coke with no refill as an alternative (a couple bottles would have been a more gracious service recovery gesture). A three stars, with the potential of four if not for all the discrepancies.",

I'm a lover of Mediterranean food and have visited just about every such restaurant in town at one time or another, but I keep returning to Khoury's.  The food is delicious, fresh and very consistent ... I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here.  Some of my favorites are the lamb shawarma, farooj (an outstanding garlicy, lemony chicken dish that is well worth the wait as they make it fresh) and jalapeno hummus.  Since my husband and I agree the Khoury's is one of our favorite restaurants we decided to have them cater our wedding a few years ago.  We dealt directly with the owner Mariz and found her to be very professional and accommodating.  She provided more than enough for our event, and as expected the food was a big hit with all or our guests.  I see a some other reviews complaining about service, so I just want to add that I have never had a bad experience here.  I also don't go into a family run casual restaurant expecting to have a perfect fine dining experience, and I refuse to nitpick good people for every little mistake they may make.  It goes without saying that I will be loyal customer of Khoury's for years to come!",

The new location is bigger, more open and has a better layout then the old location.  The one thing that has not changed is the quality of the food which is just amazing.  We have never had a bad dish here and the prices are not bad.  You get a good quantity of food to go along with the quality so if you leave hungry its your own fault.    This place is amazing and we will come back several times and I highly recommend this place.  If you have never had Mediterranean food this is a place you must try.  The bread is made fresh, the food is made fresh and everything here is definitely worth eating.",

    "text": "I stopped in for an early dinner on the weekend. The dining area was spacious and clean with a touch of sophistication without losing its casual feel. The service was great throughout the meal and our server answered every question I had without hesitation.  I ordered the house Mezza which consisted of several small plates and fresh from the oven pita bread. Even though it's a little pricy ($35) I would recommend it to share, as it allows you to taste a wide selection of what they offer. It's very filling so don't be worried that it only has one hot item, falafels.  The baba ghanouch was rich, smokey, and not overly salted. The hummus as well was definitely a notch above your run of the mill grocery quality. A fresh basket of bread was brought upon request and I could watch it being taken directly from the oven, which makes all the difference. If you are more of a meat and rice fan, you can order it easily enough on their diverse menu but for the more adventurous I highly recommend the Mezza.  Lastly,  being curious, I ordered the Mediterranean coffee. This is a very strong, thick coffee brewed with cardamom in a traditional czeve. This is not for the faint of heart, but with a touch of sugar it was better than I expected. Very strong, a slight powdery feel but not bitter at all. This was my first experience with it and would order it again. How many cups of plain ol'joe have you had? Live a little and order this after your meal.",

Ordered a takeout of their kabob combo plate of chicken, beef and kafta with rice, pita and lentil soup.  The only edible item was probably the soup.  All the meats were tough, tasteless and burned.  The 2 kabobs were tiny dried up pieces of chicken and \"filet mignon\" beef, which had an unpleasant odor, put on a skewer with similar \"veggie\" pieces.  Kafta was a tiny burned piece of ground meat equally dry and tasteless.  Even the rice was really bad and was \"garnished' with a single broccoli floret. I saw the pita being baked in the oven but it was tough, dry and tasteless as well.  I am from middle east and know what this food should taste like and this was definitely not it, not even close.  Perhaps the owners will take notice and make improvements.",

    "text": "This is the most authentic & delicious Lebanese food you can find in Vegas! My server, Brandon, was really knowledgeable & attentive, which was helpful because the menu is expansive & I had no idea where to even begin. He recommended the fresh squeezed mint lemonade & it paired perfectly with the pita, which is TO DIE FOR, and jalapeno hummus, very refreshing!!! The beef kabob was super flavorful and the rice is so good it cannot be replicated. Haven't sampled everything on the menu yet so I definitely will be back! I've tried many Mediterranean/Arabic restaurants in the area and Khourys is simply the best. Brandon was an AMAZING server and the place has such a genuine feel I would definitely recommend it!!",

It's a nice place and my hopes were high, but I was very disappointed. I LOVE Mediterranean food and sadly this was lacking. At first I was very excited to see a brick oven in the front making fresh pita, after a while I wondered why they didn't open the front door to let some cool air in as they must not make a habit of using the air con. It was warm inside. Back to the pita, it sucked, worse I've had. To me it's kind of the cornerstone of the meal and it was bad. How do you screw up pita?!? Sadly for them I won't be  back.....",

The food is consistently good and the service whether you dine in or take out is exceptional.  The hot pita bread, hummus, chicken shawarma and kabobs are among my favorites and all are  delicious.   I've turned my entire family onto to khoureys and whenever we crave middle eastern food this is where we go. Compared to many other Middle Eastern restaurants in town you without a doubt get more food for your money. For example the kabob meal comes with 3 kabobs, salad or soup and rice! The portions are not small and the quality is the best you can find in any restaurant.   I visit here at least a few times a month and I will continue to return.  Thank you Khoureys for bring quality Mediterranean food to Las Vegas.",

After going through about fifty places with him (yes he's that picky), he agreed to Khoury's. I ordered the food to go and the cashier was so sweet! We made conversation while I was waiting for the food and it was hot and fresh even when I got to his place.  I've never had Lebanese food, but I definitely would go back. The labni was to die for and I loved the kibbeh. He approved and pretty much ate everything, but the kibbeh-nayyi was his favorite. So if it's good for him, it's good for me!

They have a wood oven fired up baking endless rounds of pita to perfection. They serve the pitas as a starter while you wait for your food. I've had pita from many Greek-type places but this is by far my favorite because it was doughy whereas other pitas I've experienced were thin, dry, and reminded me of cardboard. Definitely order a side of hummus for this amazing ness! I came for dinner with a big group of 8 so we ordered practically the entire menu haha   Many appetizers to start, I highly suggest you go for whatever your eyes desire cause these little dishes are the best part of the meal! We had two kinds of salads, which I couldn't stop picking at to the end. They were topped with beautiful Roma tomatoes. For an entree we shared a ginormous meat platter with an assortment of chicken kabobs and delicious lamb. Ask for tatziki sauce because it blends in phenomenally well with the meats! Everything felt and tasted incredibly authentic",

They offer several dishes without meat (vegetarian). Their meat grapes leaves have a great flavor but they are the size of my ring finger. I have never in any other mediterranean restaurant seen grape leaves the small. Their cabbage roles are the same.  Literally the size of your finger.  The moussaka is very different than any other I have EVER had.  It is basically (dinner portion) two slices of eggplant with meat on top and then a marinara. It is clearly not baked in a casserole and topped with a cream & cheese based (bechamel).    This restaurant has been around for some time (even if this location is new). Many people in the area really like it but at the same time I don't think many people have had a lot of mediterranean options to know the difference.   It is OK. Not a must try but it will do.",

You would think the chicken would be seasoned with garlic not put garlic paste all over the chicken and call it garlic chicken sandwich with warm soggy pickles and  awful fries. The quality of the chicken was bad to.  The french fries on the side were also a let down. All I had was Basically Potato skins. So disappointed that all the money we spent on the food went to waste. Aside from these 3 sandwiches we also ordered another 2 meals that also went to waste. So unfortunate.

I hate to sound like that person but the family was of Middle Eastern decent and my family is Asian. It just felt like he was feeling the other family a little more. Cool. Just don't make it so obvious. Last thing, he took forever with check. He would walk out of the kitchen and back in not once checking on us about the check or dessert when we were obviously finished.

How does the owner state she is just a manager when we asked for the owner or manager?  How does the owner prefer to let a customer go and \"investigate\" what happened?  I have NEVER heard of such a thing, especially as I have restauranteur friends and they would NEVER allow a customer to leave unhappy.  Why ask for a phone number when they will NEVER call you?  Why not resolve the matter before the customer leaves?  These are questions that run through my head as I am appalled by Mariz's ownership skills in the restaurant business. Mariz, Telling us you're the manager and not stating you are the owner is definitely concerning.  Especially when you allowed us to walk out the door very dissatisfied with the customer service your server provided.  When we refused the dessert because we wanted to get out of there you FAILED to make things right. If you had pride in good customer service you wouldn't have taken my number as you yet have \"called me back\"  It doesn't take a week to figure out where your staff went wrong, especially when we indicated there was disrespect from your staff.   My review was placed because you allowed us to leave.  What business owner allows that?  I don't even think a trained restaurant manager would allow a customer to leave unsatisfied.  Understaffed is one thing, RUDE and ATTITUDE is another.  The fact that YOU, as the OWNER, did nothing speaks volumes.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and even if I thought of going back, now that you have done NOTHING in over a week demonstrates you would rather lose loyal customers than resolve TERRIBLE customer service.",

    "text": "This place is tops! Khoury's recently moved across town and are now dangerously convenient for me. The location is nice and relaxed, with patio seating and a chill vibe- great weekend lunch spot.  The salads are my usual pick here, $10 each but huge and loaded with toppings. The Greek with shrimp (+$4) and the Mediterranean Garbanzo (add lamb, or not) are my favorites.   Their lunch specials are well priced: $10 for a small entree (my guy likes the stuffed cabbage rolls) with a choice of side (their hummus is great!) and pita bread. Their bread is noteworthy because it's made fresh in house, super-soft and chewy.   Service is polite, call in your order if you're in a rush, and snag a loyalty card: spend enough and you'll get a $10 credit. Shirts, spice blends, and some small gifts available for purchase at the hostess stand.",

It took a few minutes for my friend and I to decide what to order, but the waitress was patient.  I decided to order the lamb and filet kebab lunch plate. They are accommodating with gluten free and low carb requests which is great. I ended up asking for broccoli in place of rice and a side of baba ghanoush.   Our meals came out quickly and everything was delicious. I haven't loved Khoury's in the past but this experience was much better and more impressive than my previous visits.   Glad to have this new convenient location and I look forward to visiting again soon.",

    "text": "Khoury's is the most legit Middle Eastern food in Las Vegas. First of all - the fact that they have garlic sauce on the menu is INCREDIBLE - it's rarely found on restaurant menus so be sure and order extra. If you haven't had garlic sauce, do yourself a favor and get your booty over to Khoury's. It has the consistency of mayo, but there are no eggs in it. The only ingredients are garlic and olive oil, so if you're planning to make out with anyone, make sure they have some too. (Also, I have tried and failed to make this at home more times than I can count. Garlic sauce is a thing of beauty when it's done right.)  I've had many of the dishes here and they're all fab.   There are only two things I don't love, so let's get to it, shall we?  1.) It's a little over-priced. I mean, look - it is the BEST middle eastern food in Vegas, I know...but like, also...Middle Eastern food is home cooking, not gourmet eating. Maybe I was spoiled growing up in Michigan where you couldn't swing a cat without hitting great hole-in-the-wall Arabic food, but the entree pricing seems about $4-6 too high. 2.) If you try and order on Postmates, there are only like 5 or 6 things available in the app. I don't know if this is because that's how they set it up on purpose, or if it's an accident, but I can say for CERTAIN that I would order delivery from them more often if the full menu was available. (The delivery company that's used on their website is awful, it's called Zuppler and the customer service is terrible. I recommend using Postmates or just picking it up yourself.)",

    "text": "Oh my gosh! Where do I start?? Hands down the BEST Mediterranean food I've ever eaten!!  My husband and I came here on a Friday afternoon for an early \"date night\" and we could not have been more pleased. The atmosphere is open yet intimate. We had another couple sitting right behind us, but it was still as if we were in our own little world. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic and made sure we were taken care of without being overly pushy or in our faces. The fresh baked pita bread right out of the fire. What else can you say about the pita. It is a carb loaded gift from the gods. Pair that with the ecstasy that was our hummus and we were easily the happiest couple in Vegas. I had falafels for my dinner and my husband had the chicken skewer. We hardly spoke during dinner because we were both in our own personal nirvana. Every now and then we would grunt at each other and take a bite of the other one's food. Everything was spot on and absolutely FANTASTIC. Oh my gosh...I almost forgot about the fresh squeezed lemonade. It was exactly as lemonade should be and was the PERFECT complement to our dinner. Then we ordered dessert. Dessert is tricky for us because I am unusually picky. We ordered rice pudding, but they were out. The waiter suggested the baklava and ice cream. I was a little hesitant (I love baklava, but it has to be done just right or it gets chewy and kind of rubbery), but we decided to give it a try. Boy were we ever glad we did! The baklava was flaky and warm and gooey and perfect and paired with the ice cream and pistachio crumbles in an absolute cacophony of perfection. Khoury's is at the top of our list of places to return to for date nights and every other time in between!",

They have a really good \"date night\" menu that comes with appetizers, salads, main dish and dessert for $45. You can't go wrong! And the stone oven pita bread  you'll just keep asking for more. Tonight we were honored to be serviced by one of the family members/owner of Khourys. When you have a family owned restaurant and can keep cooking consistently then you will have customers that will drive far to eat there! The service is spot on. They are always walking the floor.

The ambience is great to cater to any event.. from a casual day out, to a romantic dinner or a big celebration. The homemade warm fluffy bread comes straight out of the fire brick oven and it is just right to warm up your taste buds for what's to come. Every menu item is absolutely delicious from the appetizers to the main entrees. The chicken farooj is so heavenly I'm a chicken piccata fan so I don't know how I'm ever gonna appreciate any other place that serves it after trying it here! It was the perfect combination of garlic, lemon and seasonings..every bite was full of flavor. You also have to try the MINT LEMONADE (I was hesitant at first) but I'm so happy I tried it! It was sooooo divine! From the flawless service (thank you to our server Lana) to an amazing dinner experience, hats off to both the chef and server",

She asked us if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and seated us. It then took ten minutes (at least) for someone to come over to us and ask us for our drink order. We actually had to flag someone down. When the waitress came over, she apologized for the wait and was very friendly. Another waitress came over and told us that she completely forgot about us and also apologized. They were very sweet.   The food was excellent. Everything came out hot and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. We did the $40 dinner for two and ordered the Greek and Khoury salads, the meat pies, beef kabob, baked chicken and baklava. The homemade pita bread and dipping oil were also delish. We had no complaints on the food and would come back.  We will give this place another try and if the service is better, which I hope it is, I'll update my review to at least 4 stars.",

    "text": "Meh... Overall disappointing. Food was good but over priced and not enough. I don't mind paying more for good quality food but when you skimp in the portions I feel liked I got cheated. Kabobs were good but not enough meat. Barely four little pieces of meat on each skewer. Gyro meat entree however had a good portion of meat and was delicious. I've been a loyal customer for years at their original location but when they moved it's no longer convenient for me. I've been craving Khoury's hummus so I did the extra drive to get some take out last night. They don't appear to have the full menu on yelp so I decided to call it in. I was trying to order over the phone on the drive over however the girl taking my order was of no help and it seemed like I couldn't get my questions about the menu answered. I ended up ordering upon my arrival (which could have saved 20 minutes). She then told me that I was her last order (9:30p on a Saturday night when they close at 10p) and that she should have been off 45 mins ago. I laughed but in my head thinking why would you ever tell the customer this? I still tipped about 15% but then realized she left and never even finished the order. One if the other waitresses put my To Go order together, double checked everything and even made sure the bread was hot. I wish she would have got the tip. Maybe the new location has extra overhead but please don't skimp on the portions when you're already priced higher than competitors.",

I'm used to flat made in a pan kibbeh and this was kind of close.  The rice was good, the kabobs are really delicious, and I appreciate that they have meat dolmas, not just vegetarian.

This is a nice local spot different than the typical Italian/pizza that one usually goes for on a date night or just to grab a drink and catch up.  The alcohol menu isn't huge but they have plenty of options.  They wee unfortunately out of the more rare beer I wanted (please restuaranters, learn to update your menu), but I found another beer to my liking easily.  The HH menu is actually remarkably good.  Usually HH only gives you basic appetizers like hummus and falafel, but this one included actual smaller offerings of real eats.  I had 2 kabobs, lamb and steak, both excellent and super filling.  HH prices are great and under $5 for meals and drinks, but looking at the actual menu cost seemed pretty typical of the area.  Portions are very good though and can easily feed you for lunch the next day.    With a nice outdoor area to dine when the weather is nice and a very large menu, I'll be back, especially if i can make HH once again.",

We were charged full price even after pointing out THEIR menu error.  I give it 3 stars because the food was good, just disappointed in the menu change up.

I almost did with the retarded girl on the phone. Once I told her I left my to go bag her immediate response was, \"I don't see anything on the tables\", instead of saying, let me check with the other server to see if he set it aside. Let's not forget that my server never once filled my water cup and took forever just to check back with me every so often. I was a party of 1 and it literally took me over an hour to get out of that place because the service is so slow. Oh and the restaurant was practically empty with 2 SERVERS! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER KHOURY's!! Needless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone and will only go at my own risk when I crave grape leaves. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT",

Definitely have recommended this place to multiple people so far and not one has been disappointed. Even had their catering at a few events and everything is so spot on. The jalapeno hummus is a literal must try!",

Eventhough it wasn't packed, the service was slow, only 1 waitress for all tables. I ordered a combo kabob plate. The kabob was good however the rice was either left on the stove for too long or it was from the day before, the rice was cracking. It's not a cheap restaurant so you'd expect more. The Hummus and bread were great. We were a party of 4 adults a teenager and 2 kids. We ordered sojok, falafel, kebbe nayye and many other things which were good.",

I have dietary restrictions and allergies, and our server April took extra care to ensure my needs were met. Every recommendation she made was spot on, and every dish delicious. We had deep fried cauliflower, spinach ftayir, the gyro sandwich, lamb kabobs, and finished the meal with an out-of-this-world shabiet. We will definitely be returning soon. Well done!",
