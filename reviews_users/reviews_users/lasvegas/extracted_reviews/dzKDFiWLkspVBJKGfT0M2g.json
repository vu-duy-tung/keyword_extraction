Update 4-13-2015 Sad Ray no longer works there. Food is still great and the new waitress was nice, but just average, not fun like Ray!",

    "text": "I've been a customer of Oyshi for some time now. This is the newest location. The ambience was agreeable- it's spacious unlike other places with an open floor for general seating. Along the side were tables to accommodate larger groups and booths for added comfort. I was impressed with their design for the outer tables. They were more secluded but not completely shut off from then general population for privacy. For this review, I will based if off the last time I went for my younger brothers birthday. We had about 15 people. It was easy to make reservations and they had given us their largest table in the back which was a more intimate setting which I liked given the size of our group. The service was on point. Our server (who I forgot his name) would check up on us from time to time where I didn't need to go looking for him. I appreciate that. He did have two others who assisted him with out addition orders/refills. They were very accommodating to our group, given I bought a cake and they provided us with all that we needed.  The quality of the food was great both the sushi and meat. AYCE sushi and all types of steak? Hell yea!  The only thing I need to address is the quality of one of their desserts that originally when the company opened up was to die for at least for me. Their parfait dessert is ridiculous now. It needs to either be taken off the menu or don't call it a parfait at all. Majority of it is ice cream then there's a few pieces of fruit which I can count, syrup and whip cream. It would be great if they brought back how they originally made it. My family and I love eating here and we will be coming back when the cravings take over. Overall, Oyshi is one of my family and I's top sushi places to go to! A must try!",

    "text": "I've eaten at the other location, and liked it. But I tried this place, and I have JUST NOW recovered physically enough from the worst food poisoning I've ever heard of to write this review.  We got the all you can eat for a late dinner.  The sushi was fine, as far as I can remember.  I ordered oysters, two of them came in a little plate.  I slurped down the first one, and it tasted like a corpse soaked in brine.  Since I shoot raw oysters, it was already in, and I figured, what are the odds the second one will taste like that too?  MISTAKE.  I told my dining companions, \"Wow these taste like they've been dead for a while...\"  I forgot about it and moved on.  That night, my friend (who didn't have oysters) woke up around 1 or 2 am and puked.  She said she was fine the next day.  I was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach must've just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi.  I went about my day like a naive, unsuspecting fool.  Wednesday, around 4:00 pm.  In my office.  The rumblings of gastric distress started to bubble.  I had cooked my usual breakfast, and gotten a sandwich from my usual place.  I thought maybe the sandwich wasn't sitting right.  Within 20 minutes or so my vision started hazing, and my stomach started blowing up like that blueberry chick from willy wanka.  I felt nauseous.  Made it to my car and sped home, feeling sicker and sicker.  I bolted to my toilet and JUST made it in time as a violent torrent of vomit erupted from my face like a hurricane.  Violent wretching for several mintues, and then I slumped into my bed, exhausted.  However, there would be little sleep over the next 12 hours.  Every 10 to 15 minutes I would have explosive, violent, searing diaherrea like a poop volcano.  It started to feel dangerous after a full day of this, so I got myself to a hospital. I was diagnosed with a deadly food bacteria present in dirty seafood and prescribed antibiotics. As I got in my car to drive home I projectile vommitted in my car. I had to call a friend to take me home and pick up my meds. I was unable to get out of bed for a full 6 days, except to crawl on hands and knees to destroy my toilet every half hour or so.  Needless to say I will never eat here again.  I also can't see myself eating oysters ever again. Feeling thankful for modern medicine because this is the ish people die from.  NEVER FORGET. NEVER AGAIN.",

When my friends and I went yesterday for the second time, the service was below average. Although the servers were really friendly, they constantly forgot about our food. We had to remind them at least 5 times. I could look over it, but it wasn't really busy which irritated me. It was such a let down. Going to have to reconsider coming here again.",

So you feel like you're in some cavernous spot, and when it's bright & sunny out it kinda feels weird. However, if you like that sort of thing, then have at it. Our Server, Rey, was pretty awesome! His energy & enthusiasm was the light in this cave. We ordered a few things then based off his suggestion, we ordered a different roll. Nice one too!  The Food Runner, I found myself helping him out. Like when we delivered the edamame, rather than attempting to place it in the middle of the table, he placed it off to my side, because there were a few things in the way. In my experience, yes I have worked in restaurants, when that happens, you set the dish down, make room, then place the dish in the center. However, that was his kind of thing, literally, just bring the food out. Didn't add to the experience, was just there. Oh but wait! The food! Yes, we did eat here. The sushi wasn't bad. For being our first time, and we only ordered 4 out of the tons of options! Again, I've had my share of sushi and the staple of a roll is the consistency of the rice. It has to be sticky. It has to hold it all together with the help of the seaweed. Well, flavor wise, the rolls were good. Like seriously. The rice was just meh. It wasn't terribly sticky. Some parts were a little brittle & dry. No, not the worst thing, just not the best. Now here's the AWESOME part. The have all you can sushi for $20! Yup! $20!! I can do and be experiencing this little feature for sure! Of course I'll be trying more sushi options for sure! Plus, what other way can you experience a spot with an all you can option??? It's on!",

I have added a star for the friendly server our last visit, which will be the last.   It was a Saturday eve, around 6pm w four of us; two got the all you can eat, and my daughter and I, a la carte. The quality and freshness of the sushi was poor to begin with but the quality of the ayce comparatively was horrid.    It was sad but yet amusing as had a friend over from Asia and was headed to Tokyo the next day and we were watching the World Cup on their bar tv in which Japan was playing.  There are plenty of decent sushi places but this is not one of them. I had heard they're other location is good, but don't think I will even attempt as have other places on my list.",

    "text": "I live nearby and have read over the rave reviews, but only recently managed to make it in for Oyshi's AYCE lunch. The selection is large, with several sides and apps, as well as grilled dishes, to supplement the nigiri and (massive list of) sushi rolls.  Definitely ask about the daily specials to ensure you are trying their freshest fish available: the scallop, smoked salmon, conch, and mackerel on my visit were all incredible. Nigiri portions are generous with thick-cut large pieces.   Favorite rolls are the CHUNG HUA (salmon tempura and garlic yum yum spicy tuna inside topped with white fish and avocado, spicy ponzu and sesame oil sauces): it's spicy and has a great mix of flavors without being too heavy, really liked the sauces. This roll is nicely balanced out by the YELLOWTAIL TRIO (yellowtail chunks, cucumber, gobo, kaiwari topped with yellowtail sashimi dressed in ginger sauce), which is a lighter roll with the fish and fresh cucumber as the stars.   Standout apps include the sashimi salad, the vegetable tempura, and the miso soup (generous portion, lots of seaweed, and a savory-not-salty broth). The must-get orders for us include the Chung Hua roll above, a selection of nigiri, and incredible MACKEREL SPECIAL HANDROLLS, with gobo, kiwari, and cucumber.  Extra star for great service: Jesus is my favorite server f(rom another restaurant) and his attention to detail is unsurpassed. If you've never had a server recognize you across town and greet you by name, you might not understand. Jesus is the best, request him specifically if you are going for a special occasion or as a large group.",

I ordered the lava roll, yakitori beef skewers, tempura, lobster fair, seaweed salad, baked mussels, and sizzling rib eye steak. Out of everything I ordered, the stand out would have to be the baked mussels. They were absolutely addicting. If I could, I would eat a whole plater of those mussels by myself. The lobster fair was indeed a great affair in my mouth. My brothers and I attacked the entire plate within seconds. The lava roll was good for a AYCE standard. However, I was pretty disappointed about the sizzling ribeye steak. It was rather dry and lackluster.  I wasn't fond of the customer service. It was pretty slow due to the lack of staff during, but I wouldn't blame them since it's Christmas Eve. The longer the wait, the more discouraged I felt to order more food. I've been to other AYCE Asian restaurants with better food and better service. Overall, a decent dining experience.",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars for our first outing at Oyshi Sushi!  For a Holiday lunch in December, my family and some friends dined at the newer Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.  Our initial choice was Makino's (which isn't THAT bad) but we figure, \"What the Hell?  Let's go try something new!\"  Off to Oyshi it was!  On our weekend lunch the place wasn't overly busy thankfully.  Our party of 11 was seated in their more private party room towards the back of the restaurant.  Lovely decor!  Except when we looked at the HUGE mural in the party room and put it all together...it's a Japanese dude...somewhat naked!  Ha Ha Ha, but hey, at least it didn't faze us from some awesome eats.  Because we couldn't decide what to order from Oyshi's menu, the adults just ended up getting the all-you-can-eat.  And at $21 per person for lunch...it's a FRIGGIN' steal!  I mean, if you're gonna order more than one roll (which can average over $10 each easy) then this option is the way to go.  Also, if you're a sushi piggy like me it's the ONLY option!  You can guarantee each of the rolls I chose to try were in the upper price vicinity, probably around $12 per roll.    With Oyshi Sushi's all-you-can-eat menu you ALMOST get free range of the entire menu.  Most of the hot items and signature sushi rolls are available for you to order.  Only thing not on the all-you-can-eat?  Sashimi and sashimi with rice...of course.  But that's OK because there is so much to eat.  And eat we did!  I felt so bad for these folks because I just kept on ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  With just the four folks in my family, we EASILY ordered at least 12 signature rolls!  Oinkers!  And that's not including the hot dishes we ordered of the menu!  You can see how getting the all-you-can-eat saves you a bunch of $ when you are an avid sushi eater.  I estimated our total without the all-you-can-eat option - I would have spent over $175, not including tax & tip!  Yowza!  OK, so this is just to show you some of the things we ordered off of the menu (and to show you how Fatty McGee we really are when it comes to sushi):  -Tiger Roll ($12) -Oyshi Roll ($13) -Love Affair ($13) -Dynamite Roll ($11) -Volcano ($10) -Lobster Fair ($13) -Rainbow Roll ($11) -Spider Roll ($9) -Red Dragon ($11) -Monster Roll ($14) -Premium Spider Roll ($12) -Ahi Poke ($7) -Tempura Shrimp ($7) -Yakitori Beef ($4) -Edamame ($5) -Potato Croquette ($4) -Gyoza ($5)  See what I mean??  We ordered all that (for just FOUR of us), and it doesn't include multiple orders of the same sushi roll!  Add that up right there and see the savings!  Save some money AND eat well!  How can you get any better than that!?  Quality = Good!  Sushi rolls were all made to order so they were cut fresh for us.  The fish was fresh that day, no fishy smells.  The sauces were kept on the light side which I appreciate because after a while everything starts tasting like eel sauce if you're not careful.  Sushi rolls were of a nice size as well, definitely bite size but not tiny at all in order to save them money.  Rice to fish ratio was on point and very generous.    At the end of the meal (which literally took us over TWO hours) you also get your choice of one dessert.  Only ONE you say?  Yep, and I have no problem with that.  By then you are most likely stuffed like a turkey after all that rice you've consumed.  So ending the meal with something light, like a Mochi Ice Cream, or a slice of Green Tiramisu?  No problem.  I'm already feeling bad since I think my family alone ripped you guys off!  Service for our party was great considering our party of 11 was taking up space and time.  Luckily our poor little Japanese server was up to the task of our large ordering shootout.  As a mention, parties of SIX or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity.  Boy did she earn it!  We actually tipped extra over the 18% to show how much we appreciated little her serving our entire party (seriously this dainty girl was no taller than 4 feet 11 inches).  We were eaters for sure!  Combining the other folks in our group, we easily ordered at the very least 25 sushi rolls.     Will I be back here again?  Yes, yes I will.  Oyshi!",

The service was bad, waiting for water refill is at lease 30 mins. The worst of all, original check showed up on our table did not have 18% tips, but they charged on the credit card. When you sign the credit card slip, the slip says \"pre tip\" and asking you to tip again. I don't think anyone is managing the place as the busboy drop the dirty dish box on the floor, kicking the box across the dinning area. The wall painting was not family friendly.

    "text": "My cousin brought me here while I was visiting Vegas. Currently, I live in the midwest in small-town USA with no real sushi in sight (unless you think imi-crab, mayo and a cucumber wrapped up in rice & seaweed is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>). After being deprived of fresh sushi for a year, this place was *heaven* (read that again in a sing-songy voice). So at first I wanted to rate this 5 stars but then I had to remember that I was raised in California and Hawaii, so I know a thing or two about quality sushi and quality fish. We both got the AYCE for dinner! Size-wise, the rolls were kinda small. However, the filling to rice ratio was spot on. Some of the rolls were packed full of fish with no crazy veggie fillers so that was pretty great. My favorites were the Lobster Fair (not spicy) and the Dragon Roll (a little spicy). I also got the \"Maniac\" one but that was way hotter than expected. The oysters were SO good. The shrimp tempura was okay. It was nice and hot, but the batter was really thick and heavy, not light like I'm used to. I love love loved the ocean salad they serve before your main courses come.  My only disappointment was that when we ordered a second Lobster Fair towards the end of our meal, we could only eat 1/4 of it and I couldn't take the rest home. =(  [It's probably a rule with the AYCE, which makes sense, but still, it was almost a whole roll!!!]  We finished our meal with the creme brulee dessert. It's almost an amuse-bouche. You can finish it in about 2-3 bites. It doesn't really taste like like creme brulee though, it tastes more like a thick vanilla pudding with a carmelized sugar top that has a beautiful crack when you hit it with a spoon.",

My favorites are the Love Affair, the Kamikaze, and the Garlic Japanese Lasagna, yum! My wife loves the Salmon Lover roll.  The servers are super friendly and always come around to make small talk and jokes. We typically only order sushi but occasionally the servers will randomly send us appetizers to try and get us to branch out. There are also some secret unlisted menu items that they only offer to some people because of the limited availability... but you'll have to get to know the waiters first!

There was a party ahead of us so we waited but asked a passing waiter if we could just head to the sushi bar and sit down. We were told to wait for the waitress to seat us. So we patiently stood around for about 10 minutes to be seated at the bar, at which there were four open seats. The waitress eventually came and seated the party ahead so we stood at the front desk for a bit. Behind us a couple came in, headed to the bar while indicating to that waitress, who waved back to go ahead, sitting in the two middle of the remaining available seats.  My husband and I looked at each other, then the waitress who then indicated they were a party of three and could not move a seat over to let us sit at the bar as well.   We stood there kind of shocked while the waitress then told us we could either sit at a table ( wouldn't be able to do half rolls which as just two people allows us to enjoy more different rolls) or sit at the separate alcohol bar (no bartender, away from the sushi chefs, kind of dark) or wait for one of the other couples to finish at the bar. We felt pretty slighted. We had stood there politely and waited our turn to be seated, only to have the remaining pairs of seats be taken by an INCOMPLETE party with no apology at all from the waitress. Just a kind of oh well you can wait or sit elsewhere.  It was pretty upsetting to have this happen, especially considering we came for my husbands birthday and wanted to do something nice.   We left. Had come before and enjoyed the food, which brought us back, but don't know if we will be returning for awhile. Seriously if I was able to give 0 star I could!",

First it took us 30 minutes just to get water for a party of 15.  Second, when they bring out the orders they just place it on the corner of the table nearest to their entry and expect us to sort it out to whoever ordered it. Third, they just keep doing that and expect us to make room on the table instead of cleaning out our table which was a total mess because of all the empty plates on the table.  Did runners were rude. Just the worst I have ever seen compared to our other parties we had at sushi spots.  I feel our gratuity shouldn't have been automatically added after that service. Stay away from this place is you got a party.",

For non-spicy rolls, my favorites are their: japanese lasagna, lobster fair, and teriyaki chicken roll. We enjoy their red snapper, yellowtail, octopus, salmon, and spicy tuna nigiri. Gyoza, steamed or fried is amazing too. I can go on, and on.  Every employee is incredible at what they do. Always smiling, refilling the waters, very friendly, and fast. The chefs, have great personalities!  Sometimes, I come for a girls night out or I bring my toddler. They are so sweet to my boy, giving him toys and making sure he's taken care of as well.  This sushi spot is all around INCREDIBLE.",

    "text": "Is it cool that I like the interior design and art better than the food?  Just kidding.  I started out with miso soup and popcorn scallops.  The scallops were okay and it came with two sauces; some kinda mustard and I believe ranch.  Otherwise the fried scallops alone didn't have too much flavor or spice like wasabi batter or something.  Didn't meet my expectations but I dealt with it.  Eating it took me a while, but it gave me enough time to chat with Kat and her hubs about the restaurant ambience :P  This is the 3rd restaurant that I've found to have AYCE.  Nice foldable menu and good basic selections.  Salmon belly nigiri was good.  I found their fish to be on the dry side for the other nigiris as served.  Cool thing is their portions are bite size.  For my main roll I ordered the Love Affair... oooouuuu SO NOT sexyyyy either.  It looked like a mound of imitation crab mixed with crispies and lobster bits dumped on top of the cut rolls, hiding beneath the chaos.  But the flavor was good.  Nice that the restaurant has space for larger groups and separate dining areas.  The tall ceilings, creative wood designs, lighting, and paint art captured my attention the most.  Just to note too, walking into any Japanese restaurant I'm used to being greeted by the chefs or workers.  Here they have it modernly designed on the entrance wall - no joyous welcoming shouts...  Our waiter had a tiny misunderstanding with our separate tabs.  Also took a couple reminders for drink refills.  I shall end my review with a fair nod.  I might come back however it will not be my first choice for AYCE.  I wanted to have a taste of their green tea creme brulee.  Mission accomplished and I will say that their green tea creme brulee by itself is deserving of 5 stars.",

    "text": "For a while, my sushi squad (it's okay to laugh) were coming here weekly - yep, it's that good.   Oyshi is super clean, has a chill atmosphere and a friendly staff who are quite accomodating.   The menu is chock-full  of deliciousness - and you'll find something for everyone, even the non-adventurous. I love the nigiri here - perfect portion size. The ahi poke bowl is great, and I love that they've got it on the all you can eat menu, whereas most places will only permit one per person. We always get a ton of nigiri and a few of the skirt steaks, cuz they are a sizzling plate of yum that can't be resisted.   Chef Daniel was our absolute favorite, so you could count on us occupying a large booth in the back every Friday night. Since he has moved on, we hit this place up at least once per month - as some things have changed, which is a bummer - but it's overall still a great spot.   Room for improvement here would be the hot tea. They give you an entire pot (which is rad!) but because the tea leaves are left to steep, it's oftentimes incredibly bitter by the middle/end of the pot, which makes me sad.   You know we'll be back. Every other Friday for the rest of eternity :)",

    "text": "Couldn't be happier with this restaurant.  Greeted quickly and requested a booth that they cleaned right away and were sat, ordered drinks and then the waiter, Ryan started making suggestions for food.  Since I'm veganish, I didnt want traditional sushi or the sauces containing fish and they had several items on the menu to order.   And I think I tried al of them.  The potato crustini I think it was called was incredible, like deep fired mashed potatoes! Order it without the sauce if your not a meat eater.  I also had the tempura fried veggies and tofu and a veggie \"sushi\" roll that seriously couldn't have been more happy with.  (See the pics within the post).  The place is clean, upscale modern decor, clean bathrooms and the food and drinks arrived quick!  Ryan repeatedly came back to make sure everything was good and if anything else was needed.  I've read some mixed reviews on here and have to say none of the things I read were my experience here.  Every place has off days and home run days, but I have to believe the way my experience went today is more the norm.  Highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back in the future.",

They have happy hour Monday-Friday from 3:30-5:30 pm which is 20% off. Lunch is 22$ and dinner is 27$. The main detail I noticed on the menu that differs between the two is that dinner include one order of uni and other dishes... also all you can eat does not include sashimi too. Similarly to other ayce sushi place you can not share but it seems they allow some people in the same parties to not participate in the ayce options.  The staff is friendly and we came as a group so our order was completed slowly... it seems during the lunch time they only have two sushi chefs which cause the slowness but other sushi places seem that way too.   Wasn't too busy with us as a table and two other table being used. The environment is clean and the bathroom is well maintained.",

He said the next time you're in Las Vegas you need to check out this place and that \"I'll thank him later!\" This place did not disappoint! This is hands-down now my favorite place for sushi here in Las Vegas!  There are ample parking in the strip mall. This is a very nice restaurant outside and inside. The restaurant is very elegant, spacious, with high ceilings. This location appears to be a new building so everything if fresh, new, clean ....  They have a very impressive array of sushi roll selections from your basic sashimi and nigiri sushi to their hand rolls and \"signature\" hand rolls! If you love sushi, I highly recommend ordering their signature hand rolls and other hand rolls!! Most of these selections are very exotic and unique! Nice combination and mixing of ingredients! The hand rolls were my favorites here!  Service is exceptional! They kept coming to see how we were doing, as well as making sure our drinks were topped off or didn't run low.  The next time you're in Las Vegas, take a drive away from the strip for some really fine hand-crafted sushi!  Oh, and did I forget to mention? Its all you can see for about $35! Even better! Yummy!",

Our strategy is always to get the nigiri sushi/appetizers/items that are limited - totally worth it then. What I like most about this place is that the fish is fresh. We ordered A LOT of salmon. I would skip the poke - it's mostly seaweed salad. Another highlight is that you can order sizzling plates of rib eye and other meats which were nicely portioned and tasty. Also got the medium house sake for only ~$12 which actually tasted fine and you get a good amount of shots when you're sharing it btw 2 people.   Our server was funny and quick with everything. He checked on us multiple times. This location is bigger than the one on Rainbow and we didn't have to wait for a table when we came in at 9 pm on a Saturday. There were plenty of open tables as well.",

Throughout our experience here, they were attentive, service was fast and amazing.  Food: Wasn't \"blown away\" by the food but it was pretty decent. The quality and preparation was awesome and some exceeded expectations. For example, the oysters were very clean and served just right! (And this is coming from the guy who doesn't like raw oysters) The sea urchin sushi was superb too. I was too hesitant that it would be too raw and gooey but it was rich creamy like half boiled egg yolk. Try the surf and turf too because the meat wasn't a brush off. It was soft and juicy, for the price that was paid for it, it definitely stands out. All the sushi and the rolls, had great rice to ingredient ratios as well so you don't have to worry about getting too much rice and not enough seafood.  Overall I'd give this a 3.5-4 Star experience!",

I recently went there for lunch for the first time and was reminded how good the food and service are. Whenver anyone from out of town comes to visit, I always take them to one the Oyshi restaurants. I have yet to take anyone there who didn't agree it was the best sushi they have ever eaten. Amazing place, great service, tons of roll options, and very reasonably priced.",

Always takes our orders promptly and remembers our favorite rolls. It definitely says a lot about the kind of service we receive here since it's always super busy and we still get special service. The rolls are always fresh and made perfectly! Our favorite rolls are the Japanese garlic lasagna, salmon sashimi, the Ian special, and the Lobster Fair. But honestly, anything you order is amazing! We recommend this place to everyone!!",

Very unprofessional yelling in the restaurant and kitchen, swearing and he has the nerve to apologize for getting loud because it was a long day for him, no excuse!  He then tries to make conversation, but we were done! I'm very surprised none of the other workers stepped in to quiet him down.  Some of the other workers laughed at his antics but I could tell they were embarrassed.",

Get there early on a weekend dinner, it gets busy and service gets slower.  Lots of staff to make sure your food gets out fast and freshly prepared.",

I thought it was unique because I've never had AYCE sushi but coming to this place I thought it was worth . The place was really nice and clean , super spacious with nice decor . The staff was friendly and took their time with us when it came to ordering and making sure we were fine or if we needed stuff . The food was great , though the portions were small . Lots of rice on the rolls though , and they don't have much stuff when it comes to raw fish . Other than that , I thought this place was great and I would definitely come back when I'm in Vegas again !",

Tonight was the final straw though. Waited 20 minutes to reorder and that was on top of the 10 we waited for the first round. Decided to pay the bill and leave. The server asked if we were in a rush, I said no but I'm over waiting for 20 minutes to order. Then he brushed us off with a, oh that must of been all my fault. Uh, ya it was. You served the table next to us and we had a table with all empty plates and drinks. When the owners asked if everything was ok, we told them what happened. Their response? Next time will be better. Lol nah, I'll be at Sushi Koma from now on. Bye!  Love this spot. Everyone is super cool even if you want to hang out for a while. They play good music and it's not crazy loud or packed like the first spot. I like the steak bites and hot tamale roll. Try to Japanese garlic lasagna too. If you like a lil spiciness ask for spicy maniac sauce. I dip everything in it! Don't forget to ask for Kenny! Best server in Las Vegas!",

However, my experience at the Sahara location is so bad I was impelled to write this review! Tho the ambiance was nicer than the rainbow location, the customer service here is HORRIBLE! They are so slow! To make it much worse the male manager gives you a rude vibe. Boy, he needs some serious customer service training. I was gonna just ignore it thinking he might just be having a bad day, but the next few times our family came back he couldn't be more ruder(if there's such a word)   Anyway, I promised myself  I will never set foot in that location again! I love Oyshi so I will be loyal to the rainbow location only!   They just lost my business!",

Also gone is the performance stage. The rest of the decor looks half finished. Luckily, their food is much better. A sampling of tuna, albacore, halibut, and yellowtail nigiri showed that their sushi is better than your average AYCE spot. An order of pork belly was good despite drowning in sauce. Rolls were fairly well crafter with minimal rice and ample fish. Each AYCE meal comes with one dessert. I opted for the velvety smooth chocolate creme brulee with its thick sugary crust.  A kid's menu is available. My kid's order of popcorn chicken filled a large bowl. As an a la carte item, it was an inexpensive deal that easily would have fed four kids. He ended his meal with a ice cream parfait made with vanilla ice cream, granola and chocolate and strawberry syrup.  3.5 Stars",

We waited 30 minutes for our two rolls. They were not rolled well neither were the portions right. They were very difficult to eat with chop sticks due to the super loose rolling of the sushi. Because of the wait and low quality we kept our order to just one roll each. One positive was that my friend loved their Thai tea.",

    "text": "Experience:  a friend invited me to lunch, and this was the spot he picked. We met one other friend who mentioned their is another location she had frequented.   Facility: The restaurant was very nice with lots of unique accents and modern decor. They had both chair and tables and half booths with chairs too. The bar is pretty small and seats around 8-10.   Service:  It was very slow when we arrived, and it seems when restaurants are really slow, they tend to forget to check on their guests. They were friendly and helped when you asked, but I felt I had to flag them down too many times from their little congregation at the hostess booth. I'd give the service a 3 star rating.    Food:  the food was good. The $22 AYCE lunch does not include the sashimi, so that was a disappointment. They also don't serve oysters, uni or sweet shrimp for lunch. We ordered calamari, veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll, gyoza, seaweed salad, mussels, Cali salmon roll, snow mountain, a few other rolls they ordered I don't remember.  A special shout out to the dynamite, which actually had a teriyaki flavor, the Tempura shrimp, the atomic bomb roll, and this fabulous cucumber salad called sumomono, which was a nice palate cleanser.   Overall:  this was a pretty good lunch. Not my fav AYCE sushi place, but nice enough where I would come back with friends again.",

So these employees use the dirty bathroom then can't properly wash their hands then handle your food. Lovely. When I brought these issues to the servers attention and asked to speak to the manager, there isn't a manager there, she was sorry, made no adjustments for the food and walked off. $80 spent ok a place where the quality of food is not a concern and they aren't clean.",

    "text": "I've been to the other Oyshi location, on Rainbow, a handful of times when a friend is in town...its her favorite sushi spot.  Saturday night was the first time I'd been to this location, and I'd definitely return again.  For starters, we were there with a rather large group, about 13 people for a birthday party.  We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, in a private nook.  It was a really nice section.  I like the look of this location better than the other one...to me, its brighter, and seems a little less run down.  The server we had, I want to say he said that his name was Kenny?  I think it said \"Golden\" on his nametag..., anyway, he was spectacular.   Funny, friendly, triple checked on our orders.  He was really on it.    We were given a couple of \"specialties\" after we let Kenny know we were all having AYCE.  They brought out a ceviche, which I sadly, could not eat. (Avocado Allergy) Everyone else said it was delicious though.  They also brought out a Super White sashimi with a fried jalepeno on it, with an orgasm sauce (not sure if that's what they call it here, but that's what it was.).  This was really tasty. Super white is my favorite anyway, and the jalepeno was sweet with a nice kick.    As always, my husband and I ordered nigiri.   Most of what we ordered was pretty standard, but there were a couple standouts for me:  1.  The squid.  I've never eaten raw squid before; only grilled or fried.  I was anticipating a firm texture, like tako (octopus), but it was tender and delicious.  This was served with a piece of mint under the fish.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  A definite must have.  2. The Super White.  Tender.  Buttery.  Delicate... Pro tip:  Order the fresh wasabi and put some on this. (put some on everything you eat, but this one especially.)  HOLY flavor punch, Batman!  3. The halibut.  Incredible.  I've had halibut a few times, but this one was exceptional.  We really had a good experience here.  The reasons I'm only giving three stars are:  1.  They missed a few pieces of our orders.  Not a huge deal...but I REALLY wanted those oysters, and we didn't really have the opportunity to ask for them, since we ordered those towards the end of the meal, and our server was trying to get a bunch of separate checks organized.  2.  They charge for fresh wasabi.  One of my favorite spots does not charge extra for it, so this was a bummer.  We still got it, because a friend ordered it for us.  Its kind of a bummer to have your dinner budgeted and realize something you really love costs extra, when it doesn't at other places. Now that I know, if we return, we'll be better prepared.  3.  Their hot sake is bloody expensive.  $8 for a large hot house sake?  I'm used to paying $3-5 for a large bottle.   4.  At the end of the night, 3 drinks were brought out and only given to the front half of the table.  First of all...if you're only bringing 3 for us to share (since we didn't ask for them and were not charged for them)...you should probably do one for each section of the table so everyone can share a little bit of one.  Also, the drink was not made well.  It was a Moscow Mule, which is one of my favorites, and it was just not good.  WAY too much mint, not enough lime.   5.  My creme brulee was given to someone at the head of the table instead of me, so I got a half eaten creme brulee at the end of my meal.  (yes, part of that was the fault of the people I dined with, for not asking who ordered it...but if you wrote it down correctly, you should have just brought it to me.)    So...a good experience.  Service was MUCH better than the other location.  Other than the creme brulee thing, and missing my oysters, our server was really good.  People make mistakes, I'm not mad about it...but it does need to be stated.    The food was standard, but again...better than the other location.    I'd definitely come back.  It won't be my first choice, but I won't avoid it either.",

SHOUT OUT The Volcano Roll comes Honey-boo-boo style.  SERVICE Horrible. The waiter always came to our table apologizing when he didn't do anything and that's when he actually came to our table.

I wish I remembered the name of the sushi we got but they all tasted great.

My party walked in at 9:45pm when there were still about 5 tables in the restaurant. The restaurant is supposed to close at 11:00pm. The hostess with a look of disgust on her face says \"we're closed\" with no further explanation. Having this memory of this place will always leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  I've eaten here before and I can honestly say service is pretty bad and the food is not that amazing. The fish quality is poor and the food is far from special.  The oysters were enjoyable but are not on the AYCE menu.   SOHO on Jones is my go to Sushi spot in town! (Although it is not AYCE, the food is of high quality and they have an amazing happy hour and it always comes out to be the same price as doing AYCE for me).",

I had ordered and paid for my meal on postmates pickup and when I arrived I picked up my order. When I got home with my dinner I noticed this is what my 3 orders of Masago looked like. Keep in mind, I had personally picked this up and was extremely careful driving home with the $30 dinner I just paid for. The order looked as if someone threw it on the tray in a rush, and when I came to pickup there was a long line as well so quality and customer service was trash. There was no fixing it either it was in such a horrible state there was no way to eat it. I know this restaurant appears a lot on postmates and door dash, but I would strongly go against delivery with this fraudulent ass restaurant. There is nothing worse then getting all the way home and seeing this shit. Come on now..",

    "text": "I'm a HUGE sushi guy. So much so that spending over $150 isn't out of the question for some legitimately good fish.  I came here at the suggestion of my friend who had previously enjoyed it. The decor is very hip and showed a strong traditional Japanese aesthetic. An eclectic mix of hip hop was playing in the background.   So far so good....  Now here's where things went down hill. My friend and I ordered our rolls and appetizers. Soon after the waitress left our waiter arrived with our edamame. I politely asked her if I could get an extra pair of chopsticks. It technically wasn't an extra pair as I never received a pair but no biggie right? Wrong! The server was rude and asked me if I was sure. As if I had reason to lie. Dude, I don't have utensils, who cares if I got a pair or not, give me an extra pair.   Apparently though asking me if I was sure wasn't enough. She looked under my menu and all over my plates to see if I hadn't \"misplaced\" my chopsticks. This left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been more polite, expedient and professional to simply give me an extra pair. I swear I'm not stealing your sticks lady!  Another point that rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that in the 30+ minutes we were there I only got a refill on my drink during the last 3 minutes of our stay. That kind of sucked.   The food was ok. The mussels were pretty good. The reason I'm not knocking this place down to a 2 star review is because the food wasn't horrible ans because our original server, who I can only imagine 'sensed' we weren't having the best experience, tried her best to save the night. Too little, too late. Although I do appreciate the effort. You rocked.  Doubt I'll be back. If you want good AYCE sushi go to Goyemon. If you want really, really good a la carte sushi go to Yummy Sushi Grill off or lake mead and the 95.  Final word: exiting the restaurant i couldn't help but notice their B health rating. Now B isn't bad but an A is the standard and pretty much expected of any restaurant. If I could I'd give this place a 2.5/5.",

The place seemed run down not as clean as it usually is a few months back.  We walked in around 5 and it wasn't busy but as we walked to our booth literally every empty table we passed had a handful of crumbs that needed to be wiped down. When we got to our booth there was a good amount of crumbles that we wiped off our seat and spilled soy sauce on the table we had to clean before sitting.  Miso soup was overly salty as if they dropped 2 packages of miso soup in 1 serving water?? Our cucumber on our salad was very rubbery and transparent (old cucumber that was left in water for awhile .. not fresh at all)  Seeing the minor set backs we didn't choose AYCE instead we went with a few basic rolls & had the waiter suggest and pick one of the best.  Spicy Tuna was overly spicy and we like spicy but this was just way to hot!  California roll had way to much crab a SUPER small amount of avocado and 1 layer of rice I could literally count the amount of rice rolled on the seaweed.  My husband had sushi with raw fish both inside and on top which was a greyish brown color. We both looked at each other like WTH is that bc it smelled a-bit weird. Chicken teriyaki was boiled chicken with no seasoning with a watered down soy sauce layered on after it was boiled.  We ended up leaving not finishing ANYTHING we order and went to Sushi-mon which is across the street!  As we left .. again there were a lot of messy tables but 3 associates talking and laughing near the door. Very sad because this was such a good go to for good food, but this was our first ever sushi place that we left not wanting more!",

Wait staff is friendly, Chefs know what they're doing, everyone knows their jobs well, and makes you feel like you're cared about.  Literally every sushi chef is personable and remembers your tastes after you've been in a few times.  Management actually cares and is quite approachable with any issues you might have. Pretty great environment on the front end of the business. Now, the food. Literally the best quality AYCE I've had. Not sure if it's straight quality or if it's the competency of the chefs to add to it, but man do they serve some amazing plates. With pricing under $30 per head it's hard to ever pick a different place to go out to dinner together.  Great value for the price. Great service. Great food. Above all, it's consistently good. Not much more to say. Thank you to management, chefs, and staff. Keep it up.",

    "text": "Second time coming to this location after a fairly good experience the last time we came when we were in Las Vegas. The website and Yelp both say this location closes at 11pm so we went in for a late dinner at about 9pm. The restaurant was noticeably less crowded than the last time we were there but we were seated right away. Our waitress was good and quickly came by and took our orders. The first round of food came out quickly, everything was good except the uni which was definitely bad.   The restaurant started to thin out and eventually we were the only table left. I have worked restaurants for a long time so I get it, I know what it is like to be over it and want to go home. However, there is a level of professionalism that is expected when you have any customers around. My parents ordered a couple of hand rolls, etc for their last round and was definitely falling apart and literally thrown on the plate.   The biggest issue for me was one of the other employees (not our server). Before 10pm the rest of the workers were already cleaning up and talking to the other employees, no big deal I get it. However, one of the employees was incredibly unprofessional. Literally yelling (again we were the only table in the restaurant), cussing every other word, I literally heard him at one point YELL \"Oh fuck ya, when her fucking titties were hanging out!\" I am far from a prude but I was literally there with my parents who are obviously older and do not tolerate that kind of stuff. My mom was mortified, that employee did  come by our table with a half-ass \"sorry for being loud, it's been a long day\" while literally laughing. We were all over it and just wanted to get out of there. When we left not a single employee said thank you, good night, anything.   I would definitely recommend going to their other location or just trying another AYCE sushi spot.",

The chef I think was eavesdropping at our conversation lol I ordered a big bottle of sake then seaweed salad - EXCELLENT - usually I share so I have room for the real stuff. To die for sashimi platter  - red snapper, albacore ( wished they had Blue Fin), Spanish Mackerel.  Nice almost perfect sliced pieces. Lots of interesting conversation in between...more Sake.  Finally I offered sake to the Chef which I often do when I'm seated at the bar solo. He accepted and we toasted Kampai. The Piece de resistance to top off my already overstuffed belly - Unagi w avocado hand roll - moist not drenched in sauce.  Not too sweet and seaweed wrap just perfect & crisp for biting into!

We ordered a beer, two miso soup, one ahi salad, one tempura, one pork belly, one mussel, six orders of sushi, and one roll. Yes we must have ordered a lot because it took them twenty minutes to come back to the table to check on us another twenty minutes to take the second order, another twenty minutes to tell us that our order will come out in no time. ..... we gave up on waiting and asked for the check. Waitress was still nice and polite but the speed of food was no where close to four stars... more like one star. .. nice waitress made it two stars.... manager was on duty, calling and talking with someone important.

    "text": "Thought we would finally try out Oyshi since we were in the area and had heard such great reviews. Upon entering the place was fairly quiet with the exception of a screaming child, no big deal, and the normal chatter of customers. We came in around 1 on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We put in an order for the AYCE almost immediately and began waiting. It was nearly 25 minutes before we received our first things, we were told the kitchen was backed up, yet when we got our food the calamari was cold, flavorless, and rubbery. My baked roll was cold. When I asked the server if it was supposed to be at least warm, I was given the run around and he finally said it had been sitting while waiting for the other things to finish and that he could get me a new one but it'd be another 20 minutes! I agree and when 20 minutes came it was just as cold as the first time. The manager didn't seem to care and almost everyone else was getting their food in a timely manner except for us. In total we ordered 5 rolls and 1 appetizer (3 of the rolls and the appetizer being ordered in the first 5 minutes of being there) and that was in the span of an hour and a half. even after all that we were given a half ass sorry from the manager and still paid full price. This place is completely over rated and I will stick with a different sushi restaurant that is more reliable and friendly. Too bad because the place was nicely decorated but that's about as far as it went.",

    "text": "Never written a review before but this was just ridiculous.. Had been to this location multiple times and always had pretty good service. On a Wednesday night we did AYCE we were here for over 2 1/2 hours because of absolutely awful service(I actually took a 15-20min nap at the table and still nothing had changed)! Multiple times we waited over an hour for food, the times we got food it was the food runner throwing random stuff we didn't want or order and she would ignore us and run off before we could say anything. Table was never cleared until almost 2 hours in. Had to get up at times and get someone to help us so we could get refills on water or put in an order for more food we would have to wait forever for. Then after all this the manager didn't even care! Just said sorry very unapologetically and had to almost argue to get a discount on the meal that we most definitely deserved. Very disappointing. I had always liked this place and now I don't know if I will ever eat here again because of this experience which sucks because the food is always good :/",

The waitress barely looked at us when she spoke, kept calling my wife and I \"you guys\" and did not listen to our answers when she asked a question. Also no half rolls disappointing. No comparison to Yama Sushi or a couple of other places that we often frequent. Would not recommend the all you can eat as with opinion is not a good value at this restaurant. Perhaps if sitting at the Sushi bar the service would be better.  Might add; have had the pleasure of enjoying Sushi around the world, not just various locations in the US and VEGAS in particular. Doesn't make me an expert by any means, but perhaps a little more adept on determining what I expect. Whether it be Japan, Korea, Europe, Guam, Hawaii, Taiwan, or here in the US, service is service and quality is the same expectation regardless. If a restaurant wants to be great, they have to be consistent.",

The prices are lower- The ambiance is clean and classy- The music was 90's pop and at perfect volume- The staff were all so polite and helpful making selections. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because they don't offer half rolls. My husband doesn't like a lot of the raw rolls that I order and it's too much for me to share his baked rolls. All in all... It was delicious and we will DEFINITELY be back!!",

It took them 45 min to serve drinks that suppose to be the easiest thing to do. I've eaten here before and the service was way different from what I experienced. Really disappointed in the overall outcome of dining here. I couldn't give the place a half a star for some reason so I settled with one.",

When we arrived the place was half full, but still seemed overwhelmed, dirty dishes piled on empty tables with hostess clearing tables, waited about 5 minutes before she was able to seat us.  Not a big problem, but should've taken it as a sign of things to come.    We ordered some hot tea which came luke warm which got us off to a bad start.  The sushi, dragon rolls, caterpillar roll, tuna, were all fine, but took about 20 minutes to arrive.  We also ordered salads which came AFTER yes after the sushi about 30 minutes later.  When I mentioned this to the waiter, he simply said that we have two different kitchens and we bring things when they are ready.    Overall, it sushi was ok, probably 3 stars, but service was lacking so minus a star.  Probably would not go back.",

He asked for our drinks and gave us time to think about our first order. We didn't get our own plates though until we asked for it after appetizers.

Second, either the chef doesn't know the menu or he just thought that I was too stupid to know the ingredients in the rolls I ordered cuz I ordered a heart attack roll and the menu says there's yum yum soft shell crab mix inside, I watched him make it and he put regular crab mix inside, I confronted him about it and he denied it and said he did put the soft shell crab mix in it, even though it wasn't cuz there was no soft shell crab in it... Also i ordered seared mackeral nigiri and he served it to me cold, he didn't even sear it... Not to mention they give u small cuts of fish... And 3rd, the worst part about this place... They had flies in their sushi case shittin all over their fish, I didn't even notice em til my daughter showed me... They leave their sushi cases wide open even while they're just standing there with no orders, everyone knows ur supposed to close the sushi cases when ur not using em to prevent that from happening, and to keep the fish as cold as possible, but they just didn't give a shit, I can almost guarantee they're running a dirty kitchen too...Never coming back to this place again..",

My husband and I have never had a server with so much personality, so kind and made sure everything was perfect and we had everything we needed. Please, if he makes a suggestion then take it! He let us know about an item not on the menu. The burger and fries roll was phenomenal! As for the food. We tried the rainbow location and the food was good but I think the service at the Sarah location made our experience really stand out!",

    "text": "Why so fancy?!  So my wife and I were driving one day, trying to figure out how we can top off our empty stomachs when we saw this gem from the streets. Located in a plaza on Sahara off of Teneya, this spot had a clean look to it. Plenty of parking. Walked inside and almost felt as if I was under dressed. This place is Fancy. Greeted as we entered, we were shown to our table in record timing. Well, for a sushi restaurant. Very spacious, great modern decor, and plenty of seating. Well lit, with just the right amount of volume on the music.   Our server was great and gave us the full run through of the menu and drinks. No empty glasses here baby. Food came as fast as we ordered them. Well, at least from what I remember. Here's the rundown of what we ordered.  What ordered: Miso soup Ahi poke Calamari Baked mussel  Shrimp tempura Sizzling beef Beef asparagus   Nigiri: Tuna  Garlic Tuna Salmon Albacore Garlic albacore Yellowtail Ikura Uzura - quail egg Masago - smelt egg Tamago - sweet egg  Know what? We cleaned our plates. Yes we did. The fish is fresh. A bit light on flavor for the mussels, but amazing taste for the sizzling beef. Since I'm accessing long term memory and my   hippocampus isn't cooperating, I'll have to keep it short. (Note to self, write review within a week of visiting business).  This place is well worth the drive. Perfect for that elegant date, without the outrageous prices and AYCE bustle. We shall see you again FANCY!",

Did the AYCE option (and upgraded to the dinner option) since it was cheat day for one of our friends so we could ordered items only available for the dinner AYCE price. So we ordered all the dinner only items and the assorted nigiri that we often ordered. Every thing was great. Service from the sushi bar was quick and before long we were almost too stuffed to ordered desserts.  The one thing I have to constantly remember to do when dining at most Korean-operated sushi restaurants is to ask the chef to go easy on the sauce or serve it on the side for all of the specialty rolls. But that is completely a personal preference thing.  Baked Mussels were a good appetizer to start our meal.  Seared Salmon Nigri - yum  Salmon Skin + Fresh Salmon and Ikura Handroll - make sure they put all the ingredients in one hand roll and not make three different ones.  Unagi Nigiri - good, but even better if slightly more caramelized.   A la carte options, Lunch Specials are also available for anyone not in the mood for AYCE.",

I had to keep drinking water as I ate because their sushi would make my mouth dry and the rice would stick. The fish and rice ratio was way off. The fish is cut thin with a thick compressed dry rice underneath. All I eat is nigiri so it's sad that I didn't reorder nigiri for my second round.   The options here are a little limited compared to other AYCE sushi spots.   The inside is very clean and spacey which I really liked. The service was great. They were fast and always came by to ask if we wanted to order more.   Maybe I came on a off day but I didn't like this second visit here!",

Our server Sharon  Shen was very nice she made sure to check our tables for more orders or refills and even though she was busy with other tables she still had time to make small talk.   My wife got grilled beef asparagus she wasn't sure if this place had anything she might like so she ate before we came.  That's what we usually do and then she just gets appetizers but to our surprise Oyshi  Sushi  had a decent variety of things for her to choose from.  (Good to know for Next time)",

I'm not one to knit pick so I can handle a few frowny faces and rolling eyes, not that I'm a difficult customer, quite the opposite, but I've had enough of their crap. I spend hundreds of dollars a year there so I don't think it's too much to ask to be treated nicely and met with a smile. The white 20-something snowflake looking girl who sat us needs to go! She doesn't smile, she throws the menus on the divider by the table and she has terrible customer service all around. First point of contact sets the mood and this irrelevant girl shouldn't be the face of any public establishment.  If you're craving really good sushi go to Naka Sushi on Lake Mead and Rampart in the shopping center next to Chase bank, they're alot smaller, kind of a hole in the wall but the people, workers and food are top notch. Oyshi is good but they're overrated and I'm tired of paying them good money to treat me like shit as if they're doing me a favor, if I could rate them -5 stars I would, giving them 1 is being generous.

Lunch price is $23 or $24 and dinner is $27 if I remembered correctly Dinner price comes with oysters, uni, and sweet shrimp. We came in right when they opened, we were the first table for the day. Not sure what was going on but the hostess was not having it, she was not friendly and seemed annoyed having to seat us. She also helped ran food to our table and same attitude, grumpy and not happy, made us feel uncomfortable.   Our server was very nice, made recommendations and our drinks were constantly re-filled throughout our meal.   They have nice variety of rolls, lot of appetizers and other dishes you can order as part of your AYCE which is great. Rolls were pretty good, some better than others but overall I had a satisfied meal.   I have been to other places where the dinner price was lower and it comes with oysters, uni and sweet shrimp. $27 is pretty expensive for AYCE, especially since there are so many other AYCE places that offer similar options.   Overall, it was nice to try the place since my friend comes here all the time and she wanted me to try it out, but it wasn't as great of an experience for me. The hostess was the first turn off, and although the food was good I can go elsewhere for similar items but a little cheaper.",

I wanted to order so i called him and he said just one second, after 20 minutes i had to call him again. He even walks slow. I understand that it was busy but him not coming and walking slow makes me never want to come back here. I wish i had a different server. If anybody is reading this and coming here, make sure to avoid the table he is serving. I hope the management take action.",

The service was very friendly but we waited over 25 minutes for our first round of AYCE. The food quality was ok but nothing to get too excited about. Prices were average. My biggest gripes were the layout- crowded floor and you have to walk through a wait station in front of the kitchen and not run into any servers to get to the restrooms...and the music. It was nightclub music- ok whatever- but it was as loud as a nightclub. The group consensus is that we probably won't go back. It wasn't a comfortable atmosphere and not worth that for the sushi.",

Our favs were spicy tuna, ika with shiso, and unagi. The ambiance in this restaurant is comfortable- high ceilings, subtly decorated, and very spacious. This place beats Goyemon hands down. The only downside is that you are limited to one dessert per customer. If I have a craving for AYCE sushi, this will be my go to place.",

The specialty rolls are definitely not the combinations that I typically prefer. (But they do allow custom orders with AYCE). Kinda like they are trying to hard to be different. The baked mussels are the business. The mojito was awful. This was close to home we will be back to try more stuff.",

At that point I wouldn't be surprised if the water came with rice too. I get it, rice fills you up and it's a business but when you're serving up rice with fish garnishes that's how you loose business- I don't plan on coming back. I'm pretty sure there was more meat in onigiri than their rolls. Not to mention how long it took for everything. I believe that this place would be decent if those 2 things were fixed.",

    "text": "My mom's friend picked this place and she's very particular about what she eats with her limited diet so I went in trusting.  They have some cool rooms off to the side where larger parties can have more privacy (not total).  It's a trendy-looking place with modern vibes and polite, helpful staff.  It's off the beaten path for tourists, so you're more likely to run into locals here.  Lots of parking in that strip mall so we found front row spots in the early evening during the week.     For dinner they offer 2 menus, one for entrees and one for sashimi / sushi.  I asked about the AYCE option but it's not self service.  You'd have to keep ordering and if you're self conscious about people whispering about your eating capacity, probably not the safest choice. Some of our party ordered the sukiyaki (Mom said it was on the sweet side, but she liked it), salmon teriyaki, rib eye teriyaki and I don't recall the rest.  I had some salmon sashimi with a rainbow roll.  My aunt shared a lot of her ribeye and it was great, but it comes out sizzing on a hot plate so if you don't eat it right away it quickly turns from being medium rare to well done.  :-/  Didn't like that form over function choice but is okay since I avoid red meat.  My meal was okay.  Nothing mouth popping.  It's a little pricey.  My meal was well over $20 and other dishes range around $15 to $18 for a single serving.  It's not a bad choice for sushi but not worth going out of your way to visit.",

    "text": "My first experience with sushi in Las Vegas was at the original Oyshi on Rainbow.  I decided to give this place a try tonight as it's much closer to home.  I ordered AYCE and with iced tea and tax, the cost was just under $32.  Items ordered:  Sweet shrimp Uni Agedashi tofu Miso Spanish mackerel (nigiri) Salmon belly (nigiri) Yellow tail (nigiri) Dynamite (baked in a round pan not a roll) Sibuya (deep fried 5 piece roll with no rice) Lava flow (8 piece traditional roll) Green tea tiramisu  One of the rules is you can only get one order of uni and sweet shrimp per person.  I ordered those first from the appetizer section.  I'd pass on these two items again.  The uni wasn't that great and there was nothing special about the sweet shrimp.  The miso was fairly traditional.  The three nigiri that I ordered for the second wave were just OK.      Then the best part came.  The dynamite in a pan is very good.  It's a baked crab mix with scallops, onions, mushrooms, and shrimp with a yum-yum sauce.  It's baked and topped with the sauce and sesame.  Very enjoyable.  The Sibuya is a 5 piece--no rice--deep fried roll filled with spicy tuna, salmon, cooked shrimp, and avocado topped with smelt eggs.  The topping is yum-yum and eel sauces.  This had a good spiciness to it with the spicy tuna and the deep frying gave it a good flavor.  Finally, if you like a little heat, the Lava Flow is spicy tuna and asparagus inside and topped with seared whitefish and jalapenos with added topping of Nyi sauce and flaming chili sauce.  Tasty.  For dessert, I got the green tea tiramisu--a green tea cake soaked with green tea.  A good ending.  My server was Ray and he was excellent giving me some suggestions.  Service from the sushi bar was prompt.  I was brought a new iced tea just before I finished my first glass.  With some of the spicy food, you needed a cool down.  An OK dinner.",

    "text": "Sad to say, but this restaurant has gone down in service and quality over the past few years.  I dined in here with my family for my mom's birthday. My mom was craving her beloved \"love affair\" roll and green tea ice cream parfait so we decided to dine in here. Sadly, we found out towards the end of our meal that they didn't even have green tea ice cream. :(  Service: It could improve a lot. Our waiter made it seem like we were just another table to wait on. It seemed like he just hated his job overall, no smiles at all. We had to remind him a few times on some missing items.   We kept getting incorrect orders brought out to us and had to reject them probably twice. We either received 2x or 1/2 of our item orders. For example we only ordered 2 orders of amaebi, we received 3 orders. No big deal. Then maybe 5 min later they brought out 3 more orders of amaebi that we rejected. We ordered 5 orders of baked mussles and we only received 3 orders of baked mussles.  I'm not sure if it was a server/kitchen mistake, but we tolerated it.  We were missing two of our rolls and mentioned it to our waiter. He even admitted that our rolls might have been dropped off to the wrong table. At this point you'd think he would try prioritizing our rolls, but no he didn't. We told him we still wanted them (since we were still hungry from waiting for all of our orders still). He warned us that it might take awhile for our food to come out because the kitchen is backed up. That's not our problem that our food got dropped off to the wrong table.   We noticed none of the employees had any sense of urgency. Two tables next to us weren't bussed for an hour.   Quality of the food: Every time my family eats AYCE Sushi, we normally use a lot of wasabi and ginger. This wasn't the case. We received a watered-down wasabi and old ginger. Their nigiri isn't the freshest. My brother loves Uni and when he tried a nibble of it, he spat it out instantly. lmao. He said that the uni texture was jelly-like and tasted very fishy. Their \"love affair\" roll that we came for states that they use lobster. I honestly believe the \"lobster\" is just a bunch of crawfish tails. However, I think their meat is good though.  We had their grilled beef asparagus and surf and turf roll, and I think those were the highlights for me.   Cleanliness: When we first arrived, we were handed our plates for our wasabi and ginger. We were given two plates that were dirty that we didn't use. So I recommend checking guys' plates! The ladies' restroom needs to be cleaned and stocked. They were out of toilet paper and there were used paper rolls/napkins everywhere. Their bathroom checklist was public and I noticed they don't keep track of their bathroom checks. I'm going to assume they check it daily and forget to sign off of it, but considering their check list is open to the public eye.. it isn't a good sight to see for other dining patrons.  I'm giving them 2 stars because our past experiences from 3 years ago were all good and we didn't have any prior issues.",

The salmon skin handroll was nice and crispy with minimal rice. I didn't feel cheated like a lot of other Ayce sushi spots. They have a full bar, which is awesome especially if you're not in the mood for sake. Our server Lau, provided us with some of the best service I've experienced in a long time. He was knowledgeable and made great recommendations as well as entertaining us with his stories and jokes. It made the experience more personable and fun! He kept our drinks coming as requested, and constantly made sure our table was clear. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "4/8/2018:  This is our first visit here. Hubby took the AYCE lunch @ $23.00 and I had the Dinner Sushi @ $18.00.  For my meal, miso soup was served first and it was nothing to write home about. Bland and watered down. Certainly not full-bodied and there was no real \"miso\" taste to it. It's like they were holding out on the miso - too expensive to put more in the soup? To their credit, though, they did put a generous amount of wakame (seaweed) but only a small amount of tiny, tiny cubes of tofu. Dang. Tofu isn't THAT expensive! Eating their miso soup was like drinking lightly-flavored miso water mixed in with wakame and a diminutive amount of tofu bits.  Then came the tossed salad, which was a good-size salad but the dressing was minuscule. So stingy on the dressing, OMG.   The tempura dish was very good! Hot (temperature-wise) and flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed THIS dish!  Now the main dish came out, which was a variety of sashimi on top of shredded daikon (radish) and shiso leaves (very delish...LOVE these leaves!). No rice. After a long while, I finally inquired about having rice and the gal looked on our table, noting no rice there and retrieved a bowl of round-top rice.   Now back in the day when I was growing up, you NEVER served rice with a rounded top. This way of serving rice was reserved for dead people. Yep...DEAD people. My grandma used to serve little bowls of round-top rice to her deceased husband on a little Buddhist shrine she had in her bedroom.  As for the overall ambience, it was beautiful but the music they played was incongruous to the Japanese theme! Instead of quiet-tone, Asian-type music which would have been conducive and appropriate to dining and digestion, they blasted their nightclub-type music which was almost too loud for conversation. Management apparently thinks people enjoy having their eardrums blasted while eating sushi! Taste in music was pure hell - to us, anyway. Even if they played the same type of music but toned down the volume, that would have been tolerable. But they force patrons to listen to music of THEIR liking. Bad business! They are thoughtless to customers' taste in music. If you're going to inflict YOUR type of music on your patrons, have the decency to turn the volume down to background music.  As for the food server, first we had a female take our order and then later on, a male came to our table. He acted like we were putting him out when we asked for more water and a to-go box, which he brought. But when I asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box, he almost sarcastically asked me if there was anything ELSE I'd like??? My goodness. What an attitude! He's there for a job and it's his job to service patrons. It's also HIS fault that he didn't bring a plastic bag along with the to-go box. That's only common sense: You need a plastic bag to put your to-go box in, just in case the box leaks - which DID happen on the ride home.  Not once during our meal did ANYone come to our table to refill our water or ask if everything was alright.  Overall, we did enjoy our meal but because of the ambience, poor service, poor attitude, poor choice of music, lack of service/concern for its patrons, and food quality and amount, we will not be back. There's just too many other places from which to choose! Well you never know until you try, and we tried! Been there, done that.",

Ordering a bunch of different things and sharing them all is the best way to go with AYCE sushi because you discover what you love and what you don't want to go back for. This is the second location in town and it's a very nice spot. The layout, decor and fun seating arrangements are the best part of this place. The food is ok, good but not fantastic.  Vegas has so many incredible sushi spots so having as many options as we do oyshi should offer half rolls and a few sashimi options. Most sushi places do and the ultimate giveaway is the rice to fish ratio. This place is big on rice. They also didn't carry super white. WTF?   So we came in a big group and ate our hearts out but I didn't have any unbelievable moments. Some things were better then the others and my favorites from this place were the iris roll, unagi and Spanish mackerel. But again nothing was a wow. Lots of rice and a 1 hour limit.   The company was great so overall we had fun but with so many sushi options this isn't at the top of my list.",

Staff was nice, but not necessarily consistent  (few grumpy folks when I stayed at the sushi bar, but maybe more so cause I eventuality just put my headphones on).   Sushi and sashimi were both quality (sorry not a roll guy much). However, they weren't very traditional in preparation, as some sushi didn't come with the traditional automatic wasabi between rice and cut, or the brush. Not a big deal.   They offer an endless option for $32 or $37 For lunch or dinner respectfully.  I'm sure it would be worth it with the higher end, expensive rolls.   Overall, I'd definitely come again, and/or bring friends. Solid local option.",

    "text": "Sushi can be so strange, and so personal, and opinions are like *ssholes - everyone's got one. But this must be said: I love Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.   IF you come here often, you learn the pace and the chefs will learn your taste and it's like chocolate and peanut butter: magic will happen.  If you come here thinking you've got the most sophisticated sushi palate on the planet, take your stuck-up self somewhere else. Because this AYCE is not about how much uni or conch or surf clam you can talk them into giving you. It's about sitting at the sushi bar and biting into creative hand rolls that are handed to you by hand - enjoying the crackle of the toasted nori cone and having a cool time with a team of what are probably the coolest sushi chef personalities in the city. It's about enjoying the game on the generously-sized HDTVs while experiencing awesome service. My water cup / green tea cup is NEVER empty here - that is a rare thing, especially at an AYCE sushi spot!  My favorite kitchen item is their deliciously tender and flavorful 'Asian Skirt Steak' served sizzling on a bed of onions and cabbage (included in AYCE), solid apps and skewers (also included) as well as appealing gyoza (steamed or fried) and other standard \"Midwestern\" Japanese kitchen items are all included.  Not a fan of the species of oysters they serve (and I love oysters) - weird texture - so I just don't order them anymore. There are plenty of other things I like ordering. Fresh scallop sushi (better than Sushi Koma's), the 'Monster' hand roll (soft shell crab, eel, spicy crab, avocado) and a few other secret items that I'm not going to disclose because I don't want them to be out of them the next time I go, which is currently once-a-week whenever possible.  This place is the jam. (Go and discover it for yourself.)",

    "text": "I've been going to Oyshi Sushi's Rainbow location for many years (it was my favorite sushi staple), and was delighted when it's sister Sahara location opened since it was much closer to where I live.    Oyshi consistently delivers fresh tasty quality sushi to its customers.  The deep variety of choices on their menu provides both cooked and raw choices for a varied crowd of people to be able to come together and share a Japanese style menu even though some guests don't indulge in eating raw seafood.  Their traditional sushi is so skillfully prepared that their yellow tail at times seems to just melt in your mouth.  They have so many varieties of rolls that a first time visitor could spend quite a while choosing from their assortment.  After years of coming here I can recommend some of my favorites.  The Rainbow Roll is a traditional California roll topped with a variety of seafood (tuna, salmon, yellow tail) in a mouth watering colorful display.  For a spicy roll, I enjoy the Red Rock.  It's a roll filled with spicy chopped salmon, served with a spicy mayo type topping. It's not the I have to drink water type of heat, but it has just enough heat not to blow out you taste buds.  If you're a soft shell crab lover, I highly recommend the Spider Roll.  The Spider roll contains fried soft shell crab parts layered in a crab mixture, placed in a roll.  It's slightly warm, extremely tasty, and the crunch from the soft shelled crab provides a delicious mild crunch to a roll that you just cant get enough of.  The all you can eat selection also includes tempura selections as well as rib eye steak served sliced in smaller pieces, with onions on a sizzl'n hot metal based plate. If you are still able to handle dessert, they offer a sunday or moche with the all you can eat option.  Beer, Cocktails, assorted beverages and hot tea (at additional prices) are available.  Their all you can eat lunch price is slightly lower than their dinner price, so you can expect to pay approximately 25 per person for lunch and 30 per person for dinner. Of course you could purchase off the menu for lighter appetites.",

We ordered the sea urchin, tiger roll, rainbow roll, spider roll, shrimp tempura, hawaiian roll and some other appetizers. He sea urchin was very good - tasted very fresh. The tiger roll was also pretty good. The spider roll was a little weird - first it was cut super thin and fell apart when I would try and pick it up. Then it had bits of hard pieces. At first I thought it was rice that was dried out then I realized it was pieces of tempura batter from the shrimp which makes me think the shrimp tempura used in the roll was not fresh.  And then the rainbow roll seemed very dry for some odd reason.   The place was clean. Service was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't super small or super crowded like many sushi places In the area.",

I went with my husband and 2 kids and we ordered all you can eat for us and for the kids we got chicken. At the end we ordered ice cream for all of us and he was so nice for no reason at all took the kids ice cream off the bill.

Father's Day was a busy night. Still, the restaurant reserved my seating for three in front of Chef Daniel at the Sushi Bar.   The all-you-can-eat menu is pages long and includes sizzling hot plates (e.g., surf & turf), cold salads, hot soups, tempera, sushi combinations, and one selection from their dessert section for about $25.00. Although the Hamachi Kama isn't included in the all-you-can-eat price, I usually order it. It is on of my favorites.  The atmosphere is relatively quiet and roomy. The lighting is dime in the evening. This restaurant offers a more private atmosphere with room for large parties as well. They have a full service bar. They have TV's at the bar and the sushi bar.   The restaurant often has daily sushi fresh catches that are available for the all-you-can-eat patrons. I love when they have the red snapper and fresh conch.   You won't be disappointed!",

The sushi chef that helped us at the bar was very friendly and conversational.  Since we're new to Vegas, he even suggested some good places to go check out for recreational purposes.  We'd recommend this restaurant and will likely return, but will probably check out other places in town (since there are soooooo many options).  If you're nearby, I'd definitely say it's worth the stop.  Here's the rundown on food:  Things we tried that I'd recommend: Rattlesnake Roll - good stuff, great combo of flavors Oyshi Roll - the signature roll lives up to it's role - a must-have Gyoza - order it pan-friend (even though they only list deep fried & steamed) Chung Hua - Probably my favorite roll of the night Nuclear Bomb - chef made this when we requested one of his choices - not for the weak tongued.  This one's very spicy and tasty! Yellowstone - really great baked roll Ahi Poke Salad - I really enjoyed this - well rounded flavor, fresh and tasty - wife thought it was too seaweed-y Shrimp Tempura - the kiddo loves this stuff  Items you could skip: Baked Mussels - rather bland, prefer 'em creamier and with more zip Calamari - very basic, dipping sauces are okay, nothing special, needed salt Heart Attack - it's good, but have the Nuclear Bomb instead Treasure - wife said she liked it, I didn't think it really stood out much;",

    "text": "Yet another phenomenal dinner at Oyshi. Food, service, atmosphere, everything was great.   Service was attentive, but not overbearing. Never had to wait for a refill, and we were frequently checked in on.   But the real kicker was our sushi chef, Nacho. Friendly, funny and overall just awesome. I'm always impressed when the chef offers to make me their own creation, and his was truly delicious. Not like anything else I've ever had, and so amazingly plated, I almost didn't want to eat the roll.   Plus with their drink specials Mon-Thurs, this place is definitely in my AYCE sushi rotation.",

    "text": "This place is 5 stars all the way. I'm honestly not an owner, a relative of the owner or a friend of the owner. I don't even live in Vegas I am from LA and here on business. But I do get to Vegas quite a bit. And now every time u do get out this way I will be eating here.   I was finishing up a business meeting about 2 miles away and looked on yelp for a sushi place with a good rating. They fit the bill so I drove over there knowing nothing other than they got a great rating on yelp.  When u drove up I was immediately impressed with the outside as it was very attractive and was obviously part of a new shopping center. Then I saw their sign that they had an all you can eat dinner and I got really excited!  Anybody that knows me knows that I can eat. And if your offering me all you can eat im going to be there for a whole. And since I hadn't eaten all day I was ready. I sat at the sushi bar where they told me everything on the menu was available on the all you can eat with the exception of the sashimi.   There were 5 people behind the counter at the sushi bar and they cranked out the food really fast. But it didn't taste rushed and it certainly didn't taste like all you can eat. In fact it might of been True bast sushi I've ever had.   There was one sushi chef that took care of me almost entirely. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because he have me great service as did everyone else I came on contact with.   So to sum it up if you live in Vegas or are visiting (it's only about 10-15 minutes from the strip) you must try it. If you line sushi you will love this place.",

As with any group that is doing AYCE, we got to try a lot of the menu through coordinating orders and sharing with each other. From the appetizer section, to the desserts, everything we had was pretty tastey.   Some highlights were their surf and turf roll, fried gyoza, sweet shrimp nigiri and fried heads, eel nigiri, tamago nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, and their baked mussels.  The only real low points with the food was that the super white tuna wasn't that good, and each person could only have two orders of their awesome baked mussels.   The service from the staff was top notch. While it took awhile to get our food a couple of times when the restaurant got full and busy, the servers and what we assumed was the floor manager always made sure to check on our orders and help get stuff to our table. The floor manager even took our order a couple of times, cleared our table, and refilled our drinks on more than one occasion. The staff there was firing on all cylinders and was really attentive.   This was my second time coming here, and I really enjoyed the food and service again. I definetly will be coming back, and with more people. I would recommend coming to this place.",

We got our drinks, then the wait came. The sushi chefs literally didn't acknowledge us one time. It look maybe 20-25 minutes for the waiter to come back. Another 25 to get any of our food, then it all came out very slow. We were there for like over two hours. They kept walking past us, taking orders from other people, and serving them first without even asking us if we wanted more. Uh. Okay.  The food, however, still awesome. Muscles and oysters are sooo good, the miso pork belly, nigiri, heart attack and the \"my favorite\" rolls were sooo good, plus the always delish rainbow roll. The Chung hua was pretty good, but the other one we got was kinda weird and bland.   Basically, 4 for food, 2 for service. I'll go back though. Every place needs a second chance.",

The first time was for lunch, we did not partake in the All-You-Can-Eat option, rather just ordered a few rolls and apps. The waiter was so friendly and enthusiastic we decided to bring a few people who were visiting back for Dinner.  Now for dinner, hell yes we all did the All-You-Can-Eat! It was $27 bucks each, awesome. We were committed to taking them down! One roll at a time! OK, so we did not end of doing that, but we has a super fun night with lots of great food!  Our waiter Kenny was a rock star! We were goofing and laughing with him all night! And we had a lot to laugh at, because apparently the new food runners had not quite figured out the table numbers and kept delivering our food to other tables, and vice-a-versa. I know this sounds annoying, but oddly enough it became part of the entertainment of the night. Kenny kept checking in to see what we were still waiting for, and making sure it came. We were never missing sushi on the table or going hungry, he just had to order a couple specific rolls 2-3 times before they finally made there way to us. We had a blast!  Insider tips.... -They do take reservations, but the only way to make them is to actually speak to a hostess. The girl at the front desk admitted to me they never check the answering machine.   -They have an awesome large room if you want to have an AYCE shushi party! It is separated from the Dining Room and looks super cozy!  -Last tip, AYCE is less during lunch. Only $22, as opposed to dinner time when it is $27",

We came on a Sunday for a surprise lunch for my mom for Mother's Day (I made sure it wasn't ON the actual day so she'll be genuinely surprised. Hehe) Let me start off by saying that I've never been to the other Oyshi location so I'm not here to compare or anything like that.  So, the interior is just GORGEOUS! High ceilings, beautiful decor, bold, gorgeous color. The tables, benches and chairs are comfortable and spacious. Our hostess greeted us with a smile and our server Kyle, was just as delightful. He was so sweet and nice and accommodated us very well. Always checked up on us, with a smile every time.   Now on to the food. Divine! I've had a lot of sushi and Japanese food, in general and this place is one of the best I've ever been to. Food quality is amazing. The fish was so fresh and sushi never broke apart (Sadly, I've been to a lot that does & it's not pleasant). Hot foods came to us really hot so we knew they were freshly cooked. I loved it!  Oh & the best part would have to be the price. AYCE lunch was $21.95. For the classiest, yummiest, Japanese food, that is inexpensive! Sushi items seemed endless so you'll have a variety on top of the kitchen items. And please, please, please, try the Green Tea Creme Brulee & Green Tiramisu. Eating them was.. love at first bite!",

My brother and I usually get the Uni to further test their seafood quality. We even tried their oysters (we usually don't) and they are very good as well. They also have an extensive menu and even offer uncommon items like Natto (fermented soybeans). The service was excellent; i think this was partly because they thought we were new to AYCE dining. Overall a solid sushi spot for AYCE.",

    "text": "A few other people have already complained about the service  Not sure our server's name, maybe it was also Kevin, maybe not.  Considering every place we went in Vegas was wonderful and the service incredibly good, it was quite a contrast that the service at Oyshi was so poor.  I didn't like the server because his language and behavior was like high school kid.  I understand a $50 meal for two isn't luxury, but it isn't cheap.  Also we tried to wave at him 3-4 times and he wouldn't acknowledge we were there.  It takes the fun out of going to a buffet.  I wonder if management does this on purpose so people don't eat too much.  We eventually changed servers, but I felt like they didn't care that much.  In my whole life, I've never felt angry at a restaurant.  Honestly, I get more polite and better service at McDonald's.  At times the server was just talking to his friends, the cook about girls.  We felt uncomfortable at this place and just left after a few dishes.  It was a waste of money and no one likes to do that.  Food is fine for this kind of thing so no complaints there.  But it's important for customer to feel comfortable at a restaurant.  Do not go here.  Literally every other worker and server and person in Vegas we met was awesome, had a wonderful time.  But this restaurant was a bad experience.",

I was very surprised that it was only 1/3 the size of what I normally order here in Hawaii. You're eating in Vegas therefore, you'd expect their size to be at least normal, but that's what you get when they want to be cinchy, frugal, or should I say tight .

It was very normal and nice at the beginning of our dinner.  We stared with miso soup and seaweed salad and some other appetizers. Then we ordered some sushi and the first problem was started with sushi. Their sushi was too many rice with fish. I could not think about taking a picture but it seems like 'Oh you guys will have AYCE? then I will make you not to eat too much.' for me. I wasn't sure whether I order sushi or rice.    Then we ordered 2 kinds of rolls and another seaweed salad during eating it. As you can see in other people's reviews, this place's services sometimes very slow. I expected that seaweed salad can be served right a way because they do not have to cook. We called our server and he just said it will be coming so no rush. Then the seaweed salad came out when we are almost done. You know, seaweed salad is just salad and probably most people eat seaweed salad with other main dishes. That time, we were almost finished so we couldn't finish our seaweed salad.   And finally, we asked for check and told our server that we are all finished. Then he said that he has to charge for leftovers which were 2 peices of roll and seaweed salad. And it will be the normal price, $8, which is regular price for the roll and $5 for seaweed salad. I knew there are leftover charges but I didn't know that they will charge the normal prices. Isn't that means we can take out leftovers when we charge normal prices? But it was also fine. I knew I have to pay for the leftovers because it is AYCE so I said okay we will pay. And he brought check with only extra $5 for seaweed salad. Okay I appreciate with it.  We were disappointed with sushi, slow service, and leftover charge. Then we pay the tip only $1. I know it is kinda rude, but today, I didn't really want to tip them. Then we came out from OYSHI SUSHI.   THE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS. GUESS WHAT.  OUR SERVER FOLLOWED US AND STARTED TO YELL AT US AND SAID F**KING A** HOLE, F**K YOU AND KEEP SWEAR AT US  Before that, we thought today was not really good so we should come again and enjoy our meal but once we hear that the server yelling and swear at us, I thought  tip him $1 was execellent choice.   I know it is not really manner put $1 for tip. But what kind of manner is that? Even though he was upset with us that we put a dollar for tip, that does not mean that he should say FU*K YOU AT CUSTOMERS. MC.DONALD'S WILL HAVE BETTER SERVICE THAN THAT!!!!!!!!! May be he wants too, I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE WITH PAYING 26-27 DOLLARS TO GET THE WORD FU*K.",

    "text": "This place is owned by the same oyshi on rainbow and robin dale in the southwest, so naturally I thought it would be pretty good. Unfortunately like my carnal lust for orgasmic sushi I was left disappointed and a bit unsatisfied. Having said that it wasn't all that bad. The fantasy roll, heart attack roll and a classic remix a crazy Cali roll were great. The one roll that was a huge disappointment was the Ian special. As for sides the ginger didn't taste fresh at all or the wasabi. The service was very spotty, the server forgot to refill my water quite a few times and the Resturant wasn't even that busy. The ambience is decent and nice. Not to ostentatious or to subtle but a nice complement to setting the mood right for a memorable night out.   All in all the place is average at best in terms of price and service. The plus point and a huge reason to return is the roll have a new fresh take on them and many of sound good to try, there is too many to try by yourself. Bring 7 people with you on your quest for something new and exciting. Some rolls will be forgettable kind of like their service but others will leave you lost in a sea mind numbing, thought altering perception. Definite place to try if you are up for something new.",

Among the plethora of nearby sushi restaurants, my friends and I consistently choose yours because you have the best menu, cooked by the best chefs, and served by the best service staff in town. I can't be adamant enough about this. Your restaurant is the closest thing to a perfect sushi restaurant for the price that I have ever been to. If I had one gripe however, it is with the lack of assortment provided for the mochi. Only strawberry?! In 2015? What is this North Korea? Where are the choices?? A meal as good as the ones you provide deserve a happy ending, David. You of all people should know that. Keep up the phenomenal work and PLEASE consider offering more variety in your mochi!!!",

    "text": "This was, by far, the worst dining experience that I've ever had. My girlfriend and I met here for lunch. Our server was apathetic, so say the least. My girlfriend inquired about a lunch special, which was called \"Sizzling Plate\". Our server stood their staring at his notebook and kind of shrugged his shoulders in response. My friend asked him if he was new there, and he mumbled \"kinda new\" while still staring at his notebook. She pulled out the menu and pointed to the plate that she was asking about and went ahead and ordered it. Five minutes later, he came back with a different menu in which the Sizzling Plate was crossed out with a black sharpie. He told us that they no longer offer that special. We asked for a manager, and out came Peter. Peter seems like a very nice person; however, he is by no means management material. It is clear that he has not had any training in diffusing situations or handling customer complaints. He reiterated that they no longer offered that special, even though the special was still listed in the menu that we had received. We went back and forth until I proposed that they honor the special for us until they update all of their menus, to which he obliged. I decided to mention to him that our server was very rude and dismissive, only to hear from Peter that our server was sick and not feeling well. (IMO, our server seemed hungover...) As Peter walked away without apologizing for a rocky start, I saw our \"sick\" server making our drinks, which involved cutting fruit and gathering mint leaves to be muddled. There was no bartender on duty, which was abundantly apparent when we took a sip of our drinks- my drink was supposed to be a strawberry and mint infused lemonade, but it tasted like strawberries and rum... I sent it back. My girlfriend also sent hers back, as it tasted terrible as well. We waited 40 minutes for our food. We had to ask three times for our checks. Once we finally received them, Peter still had not offered an apology for the terrible, apathetic, slow, uniformed service that we received. To no surprise, they had not discounted our checks for the inconvenient and mess of a meal.",

To add insult to injury the manager did not really apologize but blamed on the people who delivered the lettuce. He said he had a similar problem with the edemame.  And as if this is not all bad enough he did not even offer to comp the one item we had eaten before the bug appeared. No class!! No sense of the customer. We will stick to I Love Sushi.",

Me and my wife both like the fact that they had specialty cuts of fish such as konch shell fish, salmon belly, halibut fin, and even scallop raw. Our server was very helpful and guiding us through the menu and even helping us learn how to drink a sake bomb. We sat at the bar and cook was very helpful. Recommending cuts of fish that he thought we might enjoy. And even stearing us in the right direction for dessert. The price was only a few dollars more than where we used to go as regulars, but here we felt that we were treated nicer and also got fresher fish for our money. If you make a trek to this location, be sure to sit next to Pete at the bar. The guy knows his way around the sushi bar and is very entertaining with his blow torch when he is searing items. Definitely worth the extra dollars if you're going to spend the money on sushi anyways.  ***edit***  After multiple trips and somewheres in 100's of lbs of fish consumed we are still incredibly happy with this establishment.",

    "text": "Not bad but there's many better options.   The good: All the rolls we ordered were good and average price. The menu has a variety. The manager is present and checks on tables. The place is clean. Fish didn't taste like imitation but the rice wasn't great. The server and manager were friendly. They do let you customize a little (they took off the wasabi mango sauce for us).   The bad: Service was very slow. It was a Saturday afternoon and it wasnt packed...maybe short staffed?? The waitress may have been new (not sure). The manager did come over but it was hard to get his attention and our servers attention when we wanted to order. We had all you can eat ($27) and got about 5 rolls between the two of us plus two appetizers. The pink plastic flower stickers cheapen the decor. Seats were really uncomfortable!!",

But everything else after that was very good.   We met Kevin, GM, and found he was a very nice gentleman. He apologized for his crew not taking care of us when we showed up.   Kenny was our server and he was very polite and patient with us. Always accommodating and attentive.   The food was very good from the nigiri sushi to the rolls and the ribeye.   The place was roomy and never felt crowded or our conversations drowned out. We were able to have a discussion without having to yell. Felt comfortable there.   Had the AYCE (all you can eat) dinner and their rules are fair and written out plainly. If you are hungry, go for the AYCE as there were a great many choices that are included. Will be back when we are in town again.",

    "text": "The ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food itself was good. but the SERVICE? Let me tell you this.  I don't even write yelps, but my very first experience was with a party of 8 and at first the service was good, we were served all our appetizers and we were waiting for our actual nigiri orders to come in and another party was next to us and I saw the server give what looked like a very similar order to what we ordered, it wasn't until our party kept waiting for our orders to come that I realized that WAS our orders that the server gave away. Later that night my friend informed me she saw the same thing and over heard the server and the opposite party's conversation when they gave them our order. The opposite party said \" we didn't order that \" and the server just said \" uhh it's okay you guys can just take it \" . It's been some time since my last visit in hopes that this time that my experience would be better, and boy was I wrong! This time i was with a much smaller party. We walk in and we aren't greeted at all. And we look at the workers at the register waiting to be seated or acknowledged and we end up standing there for a little over 5 mins before someone asks if we've been helped. We wait a couple more mins before we're seated and in that time another party walks in and is greeted and seated before us. Once seated we wait again for another 5-10 mins before someone to took our drink order and we get our orders in.The food itself was again, good but the time span between everything was kind of lengthy. We would get one order at a time finish it and it would be a couple of mins before they took our plate away and the next order. My overall experience was nothing that I would recommend and I will not be returning.",

I'm super picky when it comes to fresh fish as I grew up eating some of the freshest from the California coast and Bodega Bay. Ika especially is hard to find fresh - usually I order it and am disappointed to find it mushy, but not here.  So good!",

We finally had to ask where our food was and when the hot food came out it was cold so we sent it back and waited some more.  We were not the only table this was happening to.  There seemed to be plenty of servers and bussers and everyone looked busy but there wasn't a whole lot going on.  The servers and the manager made sure to not make eye contact with anyone but glanced toward the back of the restaurant contantly.  $27.00 isn't bad for all you can eat except when you can't get the food you ordered.

I'm a dining event organizer since 2010 and I'm always searching for the good restaurant, trying it out for me to bring people to restaurant. I was driving by this restaurant and saw they have Happy hour available from 3PM to 6PM which it was just 3PM so I decided to try this place. Their happy hour menu is Dinner Menu with Lunch menu price. I was sitting at the Sushi bar and I could see 3 Sushi mens in this small sushi bar. I thought it's going to be fast. They took my orders and I only ordered Sushis and some appetizers. I got my sushi plate after I got my appetizers which I waited quiet bit already. It was alright but never had sushis in the white round plate before unless you go to Buffet or something..little different I thought. It took maybe about 10 mins to get plate to plate and last order I waited..it was way longer.  I thought they forgot my order and had to ask if it's still coming out. And waited again..and there's my food...with nasty plate. You can see the prints everywhere I was like..how can they serve food in this kind of plate? I still tried it and I could smell Sesame oil from sushi? I had 2 from the plate and start wondering where is the smell coming from and looking at the plate and started feeling disgusted...I couldn't finish I mean..I didn't want to..it was really nasty. The waitress who served me was pretty nice and friendly so I gave them 20 percent tips but food wise...I'll never going back there again.",

It wasn't as fresh. And they forgot one of my orders. So I wasn't too happy with my first experience.",

My family along with another couple were waiting and I can see that there are multiple tables available and then two different sets of people walk in and we're seated before us and it appeared that she might of been friends with the hostess. Prob why we were skipped over. I got the manager and he was just as rude as the hostess. Making the comments like I've never been at a restaurant before. The other couple also left because apparently I wasn't the only one seeing what was going on. So unless you are friends with the staff be prepared to be ignored. I took my family and drove the 30 mins to island Sushi I will never go to that place again!!",

Decided to try this place because they had AYCE sushi and they just opened.  We were the first people there.    Lunch time AYCE is $23.  There was a good selection to choose from.  I always have to get the poke salad!  Most places I go to the seaweed salad is always fishy.  Omg!!! Perfect seaweed salad not fishy at all!  The poke was sashimi style nothing added to it.  I could it the poke and soy sauce all day, it was that good!  The sushi rolls were good.  I will definitely be back to try the dinner which was $35 and it offered sangrias!!!",

I would have to say the quality of food here is average hence the 3 stars. The sea urchin wasn't that fresh but I did like the fried head for the sweet shrimp. The nigiri was okay here. Wasn't as fresh as I would like it to be and they pack a lot of rice with the nigiri. I found myself to be full fast and the cut of fish with nigiri was small. I ordered the cucumber salad and I didn't care for the dressing that came with it. The oysters were fine but the sauce did fall off one of my oyster so it wasn't a pleasant bite. They don't do half roll orders for the rolls but I liked that they do hand rolls. The hand rolls were good. They do have some rolls that are 5 pieces though. The sizzling plates were a nice bonus. We ordered the beef and shrimp one. Came out nice and hot. Overall I wouldn't come back here for AYCE. I would just order al la carte here. Food was average and could have been more fresh.",

    "text": "My wife and I are fond of trying out new-to-us places to see if they're good and provide an alternative to our go-to place -- Oyshi Sushi is NOT one we'll ever come back to!  Not only is the sushi not \"oishi\" where every piece of sushi has more rice than fish, but the rice isn't even good sushi rice. It has a sweet offputting flavour that just drowns out the experience. If the goal was to stuff the patron full to lessen the AYCE experience, they have succeeded.  The service is where it really boils down to, this is Las Vegas, a place that has so many restaurants and eateries vying for patronage and sometimes the service, not the food makes or breaks it. We had to flag down servers several times to get in our orders, that is if you even get one to give you eye contact. And then the constant repetition of asking where the order is because after a server takes it,  the order never seems to make it to the kitchen regardless of several kind follow-ups. Whatever, if you want good sushi and a pleasant experience, Oyshi Sushi is not the place to go unless you don't mind waiting for your food forever with a sub par service.  PS. It's \"all you can eat\" as long as you order just one. SMH.",

As soon as you walk in the door you're greeted which was  nice. We were seated immediately as there was no wait. Instead of sitting at the sushi bar we sat at a table which was better for all of us.  We all decided to have all you can eat as we were all starving. They have a great selection on the menu so much to choose from. The waiter even gave us recommendations on some of his favorites which was nice. I have to say The Sushi was very good and fresh and the service was great. We never waited for our rolls very long or anything to drink as he was spot on when we needed something. I would have to say the lobster roll was probably one of my favorites as well as the screaming roll. But they were all good. Some of the spicy ones that my brother got the nuclear bomb and the hot tamale were really good but I would have to say the nuclear bomb was probably hottest that I have ever eaten LOL but it was good. The sauce was lip biting for sure. I like how they put a twist on some of the rolls just when you're thinking how could they add that to a roll like cheddar cheese you eat it and it's great. I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't. I will definitely be back as it's so close to my house I could walk if I wanted to.",

Ordered a rainbow roll at 6:30pm and at 7:50pm we asked where is was. They had no clue so 15 minutes later we received the roll. It took 30 minutes to even get a water!!! Everyone around us was complaining and the whole atmosphere was a downer. Food was good, but I would rather get sushi from the grocery store then deal with this bs. P.s...they leave a pitcher of water on the table...not to be nice...it's because it's too difficult for them to even refill a water",

    "text": "Sorry oyshi sushi on rainbow but it's just me and the Sahara location now. They must be doing really well to open a second location.   This location is huge compared to the other. They have both very distinct styles and decorations that coincide perfectly. In the rainbow oyshi I sometimes feel cloister phobic when I walk in and have to sit in a jamm packed restaurant. But this location is ginormous. Twice as many customers can fit inside and they have quite a few private rooms and areas. Love that there are four tvs. Two at the bar and two at the sushi bar area. The waitress told us they're trying to put up a projection tv on the wall so all customers inside can see a game, show, or whatever. When they're able to do that it'll be even more awesome.   The children's menu is pretty good and if your child wants to do the ayce sushi they can too for a discounted price.   Don't get confused about the menu. It's very different looking and organized differently from the other location. The only thing not included in it is the sashimi, which is the 5th page.   I found that this location has more of a variety of rolls and desserts too. Such as the rainbow one has creme brulee, but this one has chocolate and green tea creme brulee. Which I should add that green tea one looks like infant poop, in color and consistency. BUT is absolutely delicious! If baby poop was that delicious I would eat it everyday. Even my husband was a little afraid to eat it, and was pleasantly surprised at how great tasting it was. He thought it tasted like the green tea ice cream just in custard form.   The usual sushi I get. Tiger, spicy tuna crunch, lobster and screaming were just as top notch as they usually are. It came out super fast and fresh. I thought it may have tasted a little fresher.. Which our waitress says she heard a lot but doesn't know how since both locations get their delivers each morning fresh. Must Be in our minds? I also got my usual calamari, grilled asparagus and egg rolls.  Like always I left plump and happy. This will definitely be our new location since it's larger and closer to our house. Go oyshi!",

We have been to this location at least monthly since it opened, at around $100 a pop. But in the last six months the service has gone from decent to TERRIBLE. We just waited 40 minutes after being seated to order entrees. Forgot the miso. Have you ever been so angry that you just had to leave without even getting the entree? That is right now. Just there a few weeks ago and they forgot to bring my dinner until after everyone was finished eating, and brought the miso with the freaking check. The time before that, they totally forgot my tempura vegetables side order. I don't know if they need to fire these servers, train them better or if the managers are assigning the tables in a way that makes it so that they only come to your table every 30 to 40 minutes... But something needs to change. Tl/Dr: excellent food... if they remember to take your order or bring it to you.",

    "text": "Overall score of one star. This review may be long but I wanted to be sure that these one-offs were not left unnoticed.   My family and I came here for dinner on Christmas Day. We called ahead and were told there was no wait. On arrival the wait was 20 minutes. Forgivingly, we decided to sit at the bar to kill time.   Low and behold: they did not have a bartender. Not only was this made noted to us, but we were told by a server  that drinks would have to be ordered when we sat down; completely fine, they seemed busy.  So we were seated in one of their private rooms. We sat  down and the menus were not spread amongst the table and placed for us to distribute amongst ourselves. In retrospect, it was a small complaint compared to the 30 total minutes we waited for our beers. Which, on delivery, the server mentioned he would be back for our order  after he brought the 22oz Sapporo bottle he forgot.  So upon his delayed return and 10 additional minutes for this bottle of beer, he attempted to again avoid taking our order. I quickly asked if we could order starters, in which he responded quickly: IF we were ready he could actually take our whole order.   We started to fire off items for our party. At this point we were just happy to be ordering. Things appeared slowly but we had to ask for the ginger and wasabi for the table after about three nigiri plates were served. It's traditional that AYCE sushi establishments either bring this with the first plate or serve it immediately after the first order is placed; this was not the case.   It was a slope from here. We had to ask a runner every time we had something missing from the table. The server wouldn't observe or offer the entire party if they needed anything else, for example: refills on beers. (Which, in my experience as a server, is key to making a great tips!) and to top it all off we were service charged as a party of 7, although their menu explicitly states 8. Luckily, it was 18% and by the end of our meal, we opted to save ourselves more time by letting it go.  They probably knew we would not be back, as on our way out the server's attempt to allay any concern was that \"(he) would redeem himself the next time.\"  That phrase in itself made me write this review. Not only did you subliminally acknowledge the subpar service you provided but you were unwilling to listen and communicate with your diners, whilst imposing a service charge that was unwarranted. This is not only a poor reflection of service standards but the unimportance the staff perceives with poor guest experiences.  I don't recommend visiting this establishment to anyone looking for anticipatory service.",

    "text": "I've never visited Oishi Sushi. This review is based on a delivery order.  To say I was underwhelmed is a such an understatement, it's almost a lie. First, the sushi. Sushi is about rice first, and this rice was NOT sushi rice. It was unflavored and didn't hold together. The sushi pieces were impossible to pick up in one piece, not even with your hand, and the rice completely fell apart if any soy sauce hit it. As far as the fish, the halibut was meh, and the tuna was bait food; sinewy and more gray in color than red. The gyoza were over cooked, room temperature and dried out, like they'd been cooked yesterday and heated under a heat lamp. And the miso soup with clams was  just watery, with barely a hint of miso. The clams in the soup were okay, but sparse.  Isn't pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant to provide soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger with delivery orders? We got bupkus. I was surprised that they supplied chopsticks, the only thing this establishment did right!  I'm sure that most of the restaurants that contract with a delivery service aim to get return business and lure customers to visit their physical location. That concept seems to have been utterly side-stepped by Oishi Sushi. There are certainly two people here who will go out of their way to avoid this establishment. You simply can't slap some poor quality fish on some stale rice, most likely cooked in a rice cooker the day before, and call it sushi.  I'm usually pretty forgiving, but this meal, for thirty plus dollars, was the biggest disappointment and waste of money that I've had in a long time. The only thing acceptable was the quality of their waribashi (the disposable chopsticks).",

Today we tried the Sahara location, being that it was closer to our side of town. I regret not making the drive to Rainbow.   This Sahara location is very disorganized, dirty, no hot water in the bathrooms and the quality... well I have seen better technique at my local Smith's grocery. Sushi is all about the rice first, and this place must use Uncle Ben's Minute Rice.... microwave version. Please have some leadership behind the (sushi) bar and maintain quality. It's not far to ruin the brand name and possibly turn away business from your Rainbow location.    It is night and day between this location and Rainbow. Very sad that the consistency is so far off.   I regret wasting my sushi crave today on this place..  two thumbs down.",

    "text": "This is my second time here and my last. I've been eating sushi for over 14 years and this is a small step above supermarket quality. To judge sushi I base it off of its simplest form, nigiri.  2 components, rice and fish. None of the fish here tastes fresh and the rice is so dry that it gives the nigiri a weird texture. It's almost as the rice is undercooked and underseasoned.    The rolls are weird and although imaganitive, unappetizing. The combinations don't go together and don't sound like they would.  Who wants mushroom and asparagus in their sushi????  Bottom line is if you want real sushi, don't come here.  If you're with a group of people and looking for a place that will have something for everyone then go ahead and make a mistake and come here.  If I ever have to come back with my friends I won't be eating.",

As the face of the business her attitude and manners said \"We could give a crap less.\" Not the image any business wants to exude.  Our server Vangie saved the day with her bubbly attitude and her menu suggestions. After some discussion of what we were looking for Vangie recommended the all you can eat.  The expansive selection of the all you can eat menu is worth it. There are some caveats, but they are well worth it.  The only draw back that some may find with the system was half sized sushi rolls, 6 piece, instead of 8 or 10.  The sushi was good, and the other offerings tasty. I would absolutely eat there again, and the price is good for the quality.",

I don't usually see a separate area with a bar in a sushi restaurant but it's here alright! and the cocktails options look great...I will definitely try it next time ;) not today to early for that :/ hey!! don't judge it's noon/ lunch time & on a Monday ;)  A 4 star due to the flavor of the sushi, it wasn't a super wow...ur typical Vegas sushi. Nothing compares to Cali sushi:(  Service was great, cool chick w/ great eyebrows ; ) very helpful and great suggestions.  Love the in house made Creme Brulee!  A must.   I'll be back, perhaps I'll order something different and hopefully it will wow me to a 5 star  : * Will definitely recommend it to Fam. And Friends.",

The only thing was limits on the shellfish per seating (2) oysters! Fresh! But sometimes two doesn't satisfy the hunger... So have everyone order anyways, ya know!     We were seated in a semi private area for 8 , we only had 6, but was happy with the seating. Our server, working his way thru school, was very informational and provided great food service. We were there on a Monday, and there was no crowd, rumors says on weekends, you have to wait in line.    We ate well, fresh fish and everything was tasty! Based on our own experience only positive vibes!!!  Aloooooha!!!",

Sadly no recommendations from me.   1) Limited menu for AYCE.  2) Slow service for not having many customers.  3) Sushi was not as good as it is claimed.  4) They put waaaaay too much rice portions in each sushi, the ratio to rice & fish was not correct. They try to load you up in rice so you get full faster with rice.   LASTLY, Hubby & I got FOOD POISONING. I get it! You eat raw food. It's possible, but it can be prevented. I'm preventing it by not coming here again nor recommending this place.   Go to place for AYCE sushi: HANABI SUSHI. 2 thumbs up every time. Never have I gotten food poisoning either.",

There are definitely some great options for those of us who really don't eat sushi.  Atmosphere was great, service was on point until it got packed.  It understandably slowed down once people started piling in.  The appetizers and sushi are kind of on the pricey side, so you are are better off going with the all you can eat for $26 if I remember correctly.  They only limit certain items which are stated on the menu.  So here is where it gets interesting.  If your not into sushi but love seafood, I went with some baked clams (kind of heavy on the mayo but still good) and simply shrimp sushi roll.  It is still cooked.  Ask you servers, they won't steer you wrong. And you can order other items all you can eat off the appetizer menu including chicken teriyaki, steak teriyaki, surf and turf, all on a skillet.  I also had the asparagus wrapped with meat and it was very yummy.  I preferred the steak over the chicken but the chicken was still good.   Bottom line, if your friends insist on sushi but you want some other items, come here and you can't go wrong.  Oh yeah, and the sushi is great (according to my coworkers).",

One little thing, I do hope they add more offerings for kids menu, the one fave place we have in Aliante area is that they include miso soup and tempura shrimps - otherwise, highly recommended!   Side note: Best time to come in with a group is after 1pm - seems to always slow down and you get more server time.",

No bartender and place wasn't busy, a waiter did ask if I wanted water as he handed my the bill when I sat down and I replied \"it's going to take that long that I need water?\" He said should only take 5-6 minutes. After sitting for 15 minutes my to go order of 2 simple rolls ended up taking a total of about 30 minutes to put together.   Place was not busy (it was 3 pm and they had 3 sushi chefs) and I was in a big hurry (hence calling ahead) so heads up if you plan on ordering pick up, they're slow...really slow.

I loved the modern, spacious atmosphere inside. Our waiter (Ray) was very courteous and overall service was nothing to complain about. I went for the AYCE and was not disappointed. For nigiri I got several orders of salmon and halibut. I can't describe how fresh it all tasted. The sashimi just melted in my mouth which I can't say has happened before so I knew this place was the real deal. I also got the salmon avocado hand roll which was also quite good. The last thing I got was the Yellowtail Trio roll which also tasted very fresh and flavorful. Of course I couldn't leave without dessert so I got the green tea creme brulee.

My sister in law's soda glass was literally empty for a good 15 minutes. No servers are walking around, checking on us. We had to practically beg for the attention of the servers.

He should probably give up serving and be a sushi chef because the service was terrible. His excuse at the end was that he was training two other new servers. The craziest part was there was NO manager in the whole place to correct any of the issues we had! You bet he added gratuity to the check at the end though! We all happen to work in the industry, most of us down on the strip and this wouldn't fly where we work. We all sat down and ordered all you can eat around 7:30 pm. The gap between drink service and ordering was pretty long. Ok so we can handle that I guess. When we finally were able to order food came out and half of it was missing throughout this long dragged out dinner. We were missing rolls, appetizers and soup. We mentioned it a few times but we never got it. By 9:23 we were so annoyed we asked for separate checks. Now we had told him this from the beginning. I know I'm use to producing and running up to 20 separate checks at a time and it takes me about 8 min to separate them and then another 8 to process payments. We timed it and literally did not get our check back till 10pm when we all started to head up to the front of the restaurant just so we could get out of there. No apologies, no compensation and 18% added to the checks. Food was average for what we were able to try because half of it didn't come out. Stay away from this location. They just take your money and waste your time!",

I do miss the sushi place that was there before,,, they had a roll I have never seen.... It was on flames literally!!!",

Somewhere after two orders it took 35mins to get someone's attention to make another order and another 20 for someone to tell us they're making it. Our server never came back after he initially got lost, but came back to tell us \"sorry that's the way it works.\" Bullshit. Tried to be understanding seeing as they were shorthanded, but then again the restaurant was only half full and 2 servers and 2 runners walking around. Not our fault they were understaffed. The other sad thing is not everyone in the service industry is taught customer service and it clearly showed here today. Obviously won't be returning even though one of the servers(not ours) tried to repair the situation as much as he could. Too bad because the food was decent albeit it got sloppy as the meal went on.",

We also ordered drink menus & they were never brought out to us, Other than that  the food is great! I would definitely recommend the servers to be a little bit more attentive to there customers next time around though.",

Almost an hour later I got my meal. The restaurant was great but the service was severely in need. I ate 2 rolls paid my $40. For my all you can eat sushi witch I have to say forcing a gratuity I am happy to do but this was crap. Really don't recommend going there with a group of any size.",

We had a really large party here, so we reserved a separate dining room to accommodate for all of us. Their service was really great. Food came out pretty fast and the waiters are friendly and are very attentive to your needs.   The quality of the nigiri was just OK. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't particular stand out. The proportion or rice to fish is average. They give you more rice than some better places I've been to, which tends to fill you up. Also the quality of the fish wasn't great either. It was fresh, but with certain cuts of fish, you can generally taste a difference in quality from the texture. The rolls were pretty good, but they generally are at any AYCE place. None of it seems to stand out, but I rarely see that anyways.   One of things I got that usually well judges the quality of a place was the uni and a salmon skin roll. The uni was ok. Usually a good piece of uni will have that buttery texture, which this one didn't. This one also had more of a soapy taste, which is generally from uni that isn't as fresh or good quality. The salmon skin hand roll: a good one will have nice, crispy, crunchy pieces of salmon skin. But the ones I ordered here were crunchy and moist, meaning that they didn't toast it long enough to get that right texture.  Overall, it was ok. It was about $26 a person for dinner, which is pretty typical. I've already found some other better AYCE sushi places in Vegas, so I probably wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to.",

    "text": "We went to celebrate my wife's birthday with friends and family and reserved the VIP room. We have been there before and thought the food was good and wanted to go back. I do not usually post reviews but this was by far the worst experience I had to say something. From the start our server was not very forth coming. Just him asking for our drinks was a bother to him. He could not even get through the entire table of 10 before he had to excuse himself and said he will be right back. We all looked at each other like wtf just happened?? Then when he finally took all of our drink orders he ended up forgetting one and it took forever to get him to bring that drink.   We figured we better get our order in right away since we were already afraid of what was to come. So our food started coming out and the runners that were delivering the food literally had no idea what each roll was. They came to the table and had the list of what was on their tray but didn't know which was which. So they just basically put the food on the ends of our table for us to figure out what each roll was for ourselves. This happened with each person that brought anything out to our table. It ended up A couple of us didn't even receive all of our rolls and we received a couple extra rolls that didn't even order.   This was about an hour into us being there and do you think we have received any refills on our drinks by now? One of our friends actually went to the bar and asked for a pitcher of water. Literally baffled at this point.   Needless to say at the end of the evening we asked to speak to a manager and the lady that was walking by at the moment that actually paid attention to us claimed to be the manager. We told her our concerns of the service and lack there of and how they did not know any of the food they were serving. She seemed like she had heard it before but was not willing to compensate us for our troubles. Only to offer us more dessert. No thank you.   DO NOT SIT IN THE BACK ROOM AS THEY WILL FORGET YOU ARE THERE! But also please train your people on the food you serve.   10 people that will never eat at this restaurant again!",

When we were finally seated, we were given dirty menus with dripping sauce on one and both were sticky and gross to touch/look at. Menu didn't have any salmon or hamachi collar or any riceless rolls. We settled on popcorn scallops, the Iris special, a \"lovers\" roll, and all the nigiri on the specials board. None of which looked super appealing and not what we would normally order. There weren't very many choices. I was super skeptical bc none of the people making the food were Asian. I'm a little biased since I think Japanese should make Japanese food, Mexicans should make Mexican food, etc. All the fish was old. The rice was not fresh. The sauces were unimpressive. My hubby drew the line at the seared garlic albacore. It looked more like jerky and smelled terrible. He took one little bite and spit it out. He told the server that we were sorry but we were very unsatisfied with the quality of the food. The one good thing is that she didn't put up a fight. We left. Date night ruined. Do not go here unless you are into cooked rolls only. Even then you're better off with supermarket sushi.",

    "text": "It was a great place to eat. It was really quiet and nice on the inside. The sushi rolls were satisfying and they have better appetizer selections than most places I've ever been to eat sushi. The waiter was very prompt and nice. She really knew the menu very well and she was patient. You know how some waiters/waitresses can be when it's your first time at their establishment? They can be seemingly impatient and rude because they want you to hurry up and order. Not this place. She knew it was our first time, so she suggested awesome rolls and gave us plenty of time to figure out what we wanted. No rush. I would suggest going on a weekday. Some All you can eat sushi places have a timer set in place for how long you can sit there and enjoy your food.",

We went last night (Saturday) for dinner and there was no wait. You know how rare this is if you've ever been to the original.  Food was awesome as usual. Tastes so fresh. Every time I take someone new I love when it hits them that \"ohhh.... so THIS is what good sushi tastes like!\" Took full advantage of the AYCE offer. From the spicy heart attack, to the savory dynamite... it's all good.   Get there soon... before it becomes as popular as the first locations and you find yourself waiting an hour plus to be seated.",

So I went searching via the Internet. we found the best place! After 3 phone calls, we decided to make reservations at this establishment ... Each employee I spoke to was extraordinarily consistent with their description of the restaurant, the food, the service and everything within. After I made the final reservation We had felt that We had already been there and had the experience of their cuisine. The staff has that much of a visual. There was no need to look online to see what they have to offer they could explain it to you right over the phone and you could see it.   Our waitress was Jamie. And she couldn't have been more pleasant or more inviting or more amazing for The Establishment she is employed for what.. her knowledge of the extensive menu, Sushi, sashimi, rolls, drinks any specials that the chefs would/could surprise you with that night... let's just say, you didn't think twice to take her advice. And the only thing left to say is... I hope you are in your vehicle driving to one of their two locations and have a wonderful evening.",

Was very slow. There were only 7 tables occupied. The sushi's were served first (before the appetizers) 20 minutes AFTER they got our orders !!! And there were 5 sushi chefs working. One of them was busy taking a video of the other chef making a sushi roll. We never wait that long at other sushi places where there are only 2-3 chefs. Most of our appetizers came after the sushi rolls. They forgot a couple of orders but we didn't bother telling the waiter cuz we didn't want to wait another lifetime.",

She said, \"We already sat the last seating.\" Then my boyfriend asked her if we could just sit at the sushi bar. She said no. I asked her what time they sat the last seating and she checked the clock and said, \"Oh, we're still seating for 10 more minutes.\" She didn't apologize and kind of laughed it off like it was funny. It was a terrible start. We should have turned around then but we walked over and sat at the bar because we were starving! We put in our order with the waiter which was a large Saki, miso soup, edamame, and chicken terriaki. Then we ordered a couple of rolls with the chefs. What was odd is that our rolls came out before our drink order, which actually never came :(. I also had to ask a total of 3 times for my miso soup. The waiter clearly didn't care about us. For a place that has a pretty decent star rating on yelp I did not see any customer service what so ever. I was so disappointed. Do yourselves a favor and save the trip.",

We walked in and stood in front of the hostesses for at least a good 90 seconds (90 seconds too long) before we even got EYE CONTACT. They were too busy chatting amongst themselves. Then, they didn't even ask us how we were doing. We sat down and ordered - the waitress had absolutely no knowledge of the menu - huge red flag (even your staff doesn't want to eat here?). We then noticed one of our plates was dirty and had old food on it, so of course we asked for another. They took the plate back and came back with a \"new one\"... which we could clearly tell was just the old one wiped off with a rag. After that, we couldn't stay in that place one more second. Bottom line: I wouldn't send my WORST ENEMY to this restaurant. You can have the best food/product in the world but if you have terrible service, your business will STILL fail. It's a good thing there are plenty of other amazing sushi places here in Vegas - this one will not last long among them.",

The restaurant is new and large and can accommodate large parties easily. They have all you can eat at a reasonable price.    Cons: some of the quality of the fish is questionable sometimes. Ive been here a few times and sometimes I can taste that the fish is not the freshest or the best quality.   Overall, this place is not bad. Ive been here about 5 times since this location opened and before that I would go to the one on Rainbow but the wait was just so long at that one so Im glad this one opened.",

I sat at the sushi bar tonight, and the chef just absolutely stuffed me full.  I lost track of how many pieces I had, but I'm sure it was over 31, and the bill was $31.  I tipped the waitress well and threw in an extra $5 to the chef tip jar as an apology for leaving sushi on my plate.  It was all worth every bit of it, including the over-stuffed feeling I'm having now.    There were several pieces where the chef's creativity really came through.  I'd write more, but it hurts to sit down.  I will be back there just as soon as I can.    Thank you, thank you, thank you!    S.",

Looking forward to uni with quail egg, we were disappointed they were out. It was incredibly cold (I know this has nothing to do with the service).   Driving by today we decided to stop again. Got seated right away which was nice. Our server asked our drink order but by that time we were ready to order. She did not want to take our order since another customer was waiting for something. So we got our waters and waited. She came back to take our order and things already went wrong. We ordered beef tataki but got beef wrapped asparagus. Ordered another beef wrapped asparagus but got nothing. Ordered uni but they were out... again. Ordered three orders of gyoza but got two. Ordered three seaweed salads but got two. Ordered a dynamite roll and a lobster affair roll but got two lobster affair rolls. Ordered three pork belly and got one. Ordered a red dragon roll and got a regular dragon roll. The salmon nigiri was warm and did not taste fresh. We ordered the Oyshi scallops which had crab also, but when we got the order there was no scallop. I called over a food runner and sent it back. The server came back and aggressively asked us if we had ordered cooked scallops. It's like she couldn't remember anything even though she wrote it down. We said there were no scallops and she said they were chopped and mixed with the crab. It was a lie. I looked through it. Besides, no one minces scallops.   It is unreasonable to pay more for dinner prices when they are out of items only offered for dinner, like uni. This is the third time we have been to this location and all three times they did not have uni. I will never come back.",

It was my date and I's first time coming here and we were seated at the sushi bar by the very inviting waitstaff. The menu is full of choices and my date and I did not know what to get so, our sushi chef Jon had some really great suggestions and gave them to us to try and they were all AMAZING!!! my favorite was the Love-Affair roll. Also Jon really made our first time eating here a wonderful experience.  He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and provided excellent service!!! Someone give this guy a raise!! Overall, this place just because my newest favorite sushi place! Will DEFINITELY be coming here from now on.",

The staff is Awesome and the food is always on point! We of course had the AYCE and it was just as Amazing as their other location that I used to frequent.  This location is cute, dark, sexy and romantic with a fun club vibe with music playing in the background.  We enjoyed the, screaming orgasm, lobster affair, love affair, Hawaiian roll, fried scallops, gyoza, poke, sweet shrimp and shrimp tempura. I really enjoyed the New York style cheesecake and Heather enjoyed her green tea ice cream for dessert.   We ordered iced tea and were brought a nice carafe for refills.  Oyshi is the best, I am truly spoiled every time I visit and this new location is just as fantastic as the one on rainbow.",

Her excuse was that it was busy and almost closing. That should not be an excuse and it is a piss poor excuse at that. We were there 2 hours before closing.

    "text": "Oyshi is located in a plaza that doesn't have other restaurants so it was pretty empty when we went - Saturday lunch time.  The restaurant interior surprised me. Very modern and comfortable. There are private rooms for larger parties. We were seated in a private room which was perfect since there were kids with us.  AYCE = $21 for lunch, $26 for dinner. You pay the dinner price at lunch if you want oysters, ebi and uni.  Our first round consisted of mostly appetizers. Stand out apps: potato croquette - very nice fried, good flavor baked mussels - plump and covered with creamy sauce that has masago in it shrimp & veggie tempura - good batter and slightly sweeter than normal tempura sauce ahi poke - not a whole lot of fish, but great seasoning on a bed of greens  Appetizers that didn't really wow me: dynamite, spicy sashimi salad, fried calamari  Food came out in a very timely manner and the wait staff were attentive and quick.  Sushi: SALMON BELLY received much praise SPANISH MACKEREL was good but cut sloppily YELLOWTAIL was not buttery but still tasted fresh RED SNAPPER great texture and sweetness UNI TOPPED WITH QUAIL EGG was a bit discolored which concerned me and didn't have too much sea butteriness to it but still enjoyable EBI I passed on because I don't like raw shrimp but seemed okay. I tried to eat the brains but they were very shrimpy  OYSTERS plump and very white. I could've used more lemon or some sort of mignonette though  As for the rolls, they all started to taste the same. Lots of rolls are filled with krab, and topped with fish. The eel & avocado roll was very disappointing because there was too much of the teriyaki type sauce and the avocado was not ripe. Presentation was good, but the actual handiwork of the cuts wasn't that great. The salmon lover and sexy rolls had some sort of buttery yellow sauce drizzled on top that almost made me gag because there was a faint hint of banana to the sauce. I am not a banana fan. Especially not on my sushi.  Freshness: 3/5 Service: 5/5 Would I return? Yes.",

You can have one dessert per person per AYCE so we tried the green tea berry parfait & the green tea creme brulee. Absolute heaven.   Service was on point with no complaints at all.

Last time we came here they had a C health department rating and we didn't notice it until we left- and these are suppose to be properly displayed not next to the door where you can only see once you are leaving.  I will probably still come back every now and then but ever since getting sick twice I just feel like I should probably find another sushi place near my house. The servers are okay, I have only had one server that was attentive the rest usually just stop by every now and then or whenever you wave them down-- which would be understandable on busy nights but I have only ever been there after dinner rushes.",

    "text": "Dear \"Golden Boy\",  Maybe you had an off day but I was really disappointed with my AYCE dinner with you today. Upon sitting down there was rice on our chairs. 2 out of the 3 menus have some sauce and brown wet spots all over we wiped off ourselves. Water came out slow. The baked rolls came out lukewarm. The baked mussels were lukewarm. Nothing was hot. Even fried Agedashi tofu was warm. The only hot foods was the kids menu item we ordered (popcorn chicken and miso soup). The busser with the goatee was exceptional. He brought out everything I asked for right away (soysauce, the rice and soup that came with the kids meal). Our plates were not cleared and no one cared to move it when bringing it more food and our table is full of empty dishes already. I had to ask them to clear it. It wasn't a busy night. There were plenty of empty tables and maybe you were understaffed. Regardless, being over polite doesn't make up for subpar service. The tables being serviced by other servers who sat down after us got their food before us. How is that possible when theirs was fried and baked items that take time? You brought me the check even though I was still missing an order. I hope you enjoyed my eels. I came to this location because I've had multiple good experiences at the rainbow location. I should have kept driving and went to Sushi Mon like I originally intended to. Had a really disappointing time tonight. Hope you guys live up to your name so as to not mislead any more people coming for the Oyshi brand of standards.  Another food review: The caterpillar roll which has nothing to do with you had really over cooked, dry and tough eel.",

They have a lot of appetizers to choose from AND their nigiri is fantastic. I'm not a roll person, but they do sound pretty delicious. Service here is sometimes a hit or miss, personally I prefer when girls serve me because they're more attentive and provide better customer service than when I have a male server. I've been here many times that sometimes I'm greeted with \"welcome back!\" I normally recommend this place to friends or old co workers, and that says A LOT since I used to be a server at another sushi restaurant and I preferred this place over my old work. Keep in mind that I would get half off on everything at my old work but I would rather pay full price for better quality sushi over at Oyshi.  Tip: check out their daily specials by the sushi bar!~",

Oyshi at Rainbow gets crazy packed busy, and for good reason.  I am not a raw fish fan and like someone else said they have an excellent menu especially for those of us who like cooked fish.  I came to this location for the first time on a Monday at dinner time. There was only a few people here, but for some reason they sat us right next to everyone else?  Our waitress was very sweet and nice. Our food came out very slowly and took a very long time in between even though there was two cooks and not too many people. I saw a shrimp tempura lying on the floor, who knows how long, kinda gross.  It's pretty and new, but I'm not sure",

We walked in on a Saturday afternoon (party of 3) thinking it wasn't going to be busy since it was around 3:00 pm. We were not greeted by the 2 servers who were standing at the counter busily staring at their cash register like they had no idea what they were doing. After 5 minutes of standing around, we were finally asked how many was in our party. That same server left in which we thought she was going to get our table ready but in actuality, she disappeared. So again, after 5 mins we were asked if we have been helped. This server decides to take us to a table and then proceeds asking us what we would like to drink. She then leaves us at our table while we were under the assumption she was getting our water. NOPE! We waited for a good 10-15 mins and decided to get up and leave. Most horrible experience waiting around especially since we were starving. Never going back there ever again! We decided to go to Goyemon down the street and we had the best sushi and experience off the strip ever! So go to Goyemon instead of this dump of a restaurant!",

    "text": "My family and I went here for lunch today.  We all chose the AYCE option.  It was $21 for lunch and included almost everything on the menu (no sashimi).  My husband ate 8 rolls!  The food was fresh and came out at a nice pace - which gave us more time to relax and talk with each other.  We were not rushed and there was no time limit, like there are at AYCE places.  I don't eat fish - or seaweed - and was surprised that there were so many choices for me to do the AYCE as well - terriyaki chicken, gyoza, egg rolls, miso soup, salads, vegetarian rolls (with soy wraps), and beef plates.  I highly recommend the Grilled Beef Asparagus - thinly sliced beef wrapped around an asparagus spear and grilled with a light, sweet sauce on top.  Each AYCE lunch comes with 1 dessert - I had the chocolate creme brulee - absolutely fantastic!  Service was good.  Vangie, our waitress, worked at our pace.  She gave us time to look over the menu in full, made some very tasty suggestions, and was able to answer all our questions about ingredients and what was included.  Any time we accidentally veered off the included choices, Vangie let us know and suggested a similar item from the included choices.  She was very patient with us and really kept the food coming out while giving us our space.  If you go - ask for her.  I read some reviews where the server just didn't come back after awhile, not Vangie!  As she saw our plates emptying, she returned to ask if we wanted more, clear off used dishes, and refill beverages.  Oyshi is definately going onto our list of places to return - often and soon!",

We sent it back and witnessed one of the sushi chefs argue with his manager insisting he wouldn't remake it.. After like 5 more minutes of arguing with his manager in front of customers he reluctantly remade the roll but then proceeded to stare me and my date down from behind the counter.  Naturally I had had enough and summoned the manager.  Manager seemed more bothered than actually concerned on making it right and made no effort. He pretty much stood up for the chef that had previously been arguing with him.  He said that managers arguing with their employees is \"typical restaurant environment\" This is a complete disappointment as we are regular oyshi 1 customers, the other location and service and food is great.",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 12/100  They say you can only joke about a bad experience after a certain length of time. It's been a month since I paid over $100 for an all-you-can-eat for 2 and looking back, it taught me a few things.  My friend and I are currently on the hunt for great sushi places in town and this being the closest to our homes, we made it our first stop. I have fond memories of the previous sushi place that took up this space and for some reason, I was expecting the same quality food and service.   After having waited about 10-15 minutes for a seat in a half empty restaurant, we approached the hostesses in haste when we saw more recent customers led to a table before us. We had a young female server that busy Friday night. Famished from work, we were ready to go on a devouring spree which started with a plate of edamame. The fun began with their specialty rolls such as the red rock, red dragon, and surf 'n' turf - my favorite. The surf 'n' turf consisted of a thin slice of rib eye steak placed above the roll and a shrimp tempura tucked inside. Great combination topped with eel sauce, if I remember well.  Things went downhill from there. We should've just eaten all the sushi we wanted before getting dessert. Back then, I didn't know if 1 dessert per person was the rule of thumb for all sushi buffets but it certainly shocked us when our server gave us our check after creme brulee. We gave over half in cash and said to charge the rest on my card but the whole amount was charged on my card and the cash was also taken in. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might have been a flimsy mistake. After getting in touch with the manager, our cash was refunded, but only after much hassle to the restaurant and ourselves.   The food quality was good but some improvement could be made to service. Might come back again.",

She took us to the upper section where nobody was sitting.  I've had a bad experience with service here so we were weary to sit up there.  We asked if we could sit in another section and I guess that was an inconvenience.  We ended up leaving.  They weren't friendly at all.  They were even laughing at us when we left!

We could of gone to our favorite place Naked Fish but they don't have AYCE and I wanted to take my sister to a place she never been.  Get there around 7pm.... Its not busy so I figure PERFECT even better don't have to wait for table or probably wait long for our food.... WRONG!!!!!!!  They sat us down but we wanted a lil more quiet area so we can catch up.  Asked to sit at the table where I always sit with my family.  That corner table was like a fridge!!!!  My sis asked to see if they can turn off vents above us or do something, the woman server said its just the fan only and will have it lowered.   .... Said we will both have AYCE and that it was my sisters 1st time here so she showed her menu and what was not part of the AYCE.  We ordered 3 order of shrimp tempura n poke and other items.  Got the items but no poke n tempura... Place our 2nd round order and questioned where is the surf n turf, tempura n poke.....\" Oh its coming \"..... Asked Manager for another beer with 2 cold glasses n again stated we waiting on 2 surf n turf.... Finally he brings it out NOT SIZZLING n not hot!!  While other table in corner has there's coming out sizzling n smoking??!!!!!  My sis looked at me like WTF??!!!!  ALL DURING THIS TIME ITS STILL COLD AS F**K AND OUR FOOD WAS GETTING COLD BY THE SECOND!!!!!  Ask server in jokingly way if there's a jacket or blanket since its still cold.... She said I'll tell them to lower the fan.  Ummmm weren't u suppose to do that when we 1st sat down????  ..... Placed 3rd round, asked BTW we still waiting on our shrimp tempura and poke!!...... FINALLY GOT IT but only 2 orders of shrimp tempura!  At this time we were cold AF so stepped out to warm up.  Came back in and server said we turned off the fan for you.  ????.... After fact we sat here over an hour?????  So we order dessert vanilla creme brule which was good but we were still cold AF!!  Fan stop but a/c still felt like it was blasting only on us??!!!  NEVER have I ate there in that same spot and was that cold nor felt any type of draft on me!!!  .... By this time I was furious since we had to ask numerous times for our food plus while placing our order there was a long period of time to receive our food and let me remind you IT'S SLOOOOOOW!!!!!!   It been busier before and I had better service!  ......   Wrote a note on my receipt and HAND DELIVERED TO THE MANAGER!  NOW LET ME SAY THIS, I'VE DEALT WITH HIM TWICE PRIOR TO THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND HE WAS NICE AND VERY SOCIAL MAKING SURE WE WERE HAPPY WITH OUR EXPERIENCE THERE.  \"THIS TIME\" HE HAD AN ATTITUDE OF A DEBBIE DOWNER IDGAF ATTITUDE!!  NEVER ONCE SMILED OR ASK HOW'S THINGS GOING..... WHEN I PERSONALLY GAVE HIM MY TAB AND SAID THERE'S A NOTE IN IT ALL I GOT WAS A \"OK\"?!!!!  WHAT A POOR SORRY UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER TO HAVE AT A RESTAURANT!  WHERE'S YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS????  NEVER BOTHERED TO ASK A QUESTION OR TRY TO RECTIFY THE HORRIBLE EMBARRASSING SERVICE WE RECEIVE AND IN FACT THAT I RAVED ABOUT THIS PLACE ON THE WAY THERE TO MY SISTER TO ONLY BE ASHAMED I TOOK HER THERE!!!  ..... EVERYONE ASKED WHY I EVEN BOTHERED TO TIP??!!!!  I GAVE 15% TIP IN SPITE OF THE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!.....  NEVER COMING BACK NOR WILL I EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!  AFTER SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL OF MY COWORKERS AND FRIENDS, MAJORITY ALL SAID THEY STOP GOING THERE BECAUSE OF TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!",

Inside is very pretty and modern looking , music is good, host and chefs were good. Shout out to young man who was our server he was the best but I'm horrible with names so I can't remember but he was great !!! My 6 year old daughter loves sushi and our sever made her smile and enjoy her visit especially when he brought her out a ice cream sundae after asking me if it was okay for him to bring her sweets . Visit was great what I'm about to say aren't really complaints just opinions   -the twist on this place is modern and hip to were I'm more use to \"traditional\" sushi , not a negative thing just saying my opinion and a tip to people who aren't use to places that have a modern twist .   -the ice cream was yummy but I personally enjoy my green tea ice cream plain no chocolate syrup whipped cream or granola necessary . So for people who don't want all that on it just request none of that .   -THE CHEF I want to say his name was Nacho , charming and very nice and good imagination with rolls . Whole time I was just eating what ever he was creating because menu was a little overwhelming (not a bad thing) but I was inpatient and starving from the gym lol so I just wanted any food in front of me and I felt a little daring so I decided to put my trust in my sushi rolls to him lol everything was yummy !! but ONLY tip would be make smaller portions so I can try all your inventions next time I'll mention it :)   Will be returning soon :)",

My waitress Kim was quite assertive and checked in often to make sure we were pleased. Here perky personality made me smile.  Tanya was not our waitress but still checked in on us. It isn't often you find a place that the staff is friendly and keeps you laughing your entire stay. Found my new sushi addiction!! Must also add the staff is very easy on the eyes......

    "text": "We always go eat sushi here on dinner time and they always serve good but this time we Went on happy hour 3 pm to 5pm and they serve food really low quality. You can barely see fish on it. I order dragon roll and eel on top was so tiny and cucumber salad looks nasty n messy . All the sushi we order came with big chunk of rice. I guess they serve happy hrs like that coz it's 20% off from regular price. And other things i notice is once you put 2nd round sushi order they alway put more rice and less fish. Disappointed",

The fish to rice ratio is decent but not great. They tend to be a hit or miss location. I've had days where it was all on point and I've eaten till I was gonna burst because everything was perfect. Then I've had days where the rice has been purely terrible. Just hard and tasting like it's been left out for awhile. Because of this inconsistency in terms of their food quality is why I would only give them 3 stars. Great happy hour specials however. The sake deals are on point. They have the space for large groups but still the consistency is their weak spot.",

No matter how busy he gets, he's always attentive and always has a great attitude! If you come to Oyshi on SAHARA, request for Kevin. HES THE MAN!! I'm more than 100000% sure you'll love him as much as my family and I do.   To top it all off, if you may know..the sushi buffet is the best! Super tasty and comes out quick!

Sorry to say, for the first experience, i'm probably not gonna be coming back.   Service is very slow. Our first order of Ikura, Saba and spicy tuna took nearly 20 minutes to make. non of which is cooked and the restaurant was not very busy.   When we finally got our sushi, the rice was mushy. pieces were very small.   It took a while before we could put in our next order which again took a while to get to us.   Apparently we weren't the only ones not satisfied with the service. had 2 other tables that were commenting the same thing.   On to the next sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "Oyshi is pretty tasty. Their nigiri selection was more limited than what I am used to, but the pieces that we did order- the  hamachi (yellowtail) in particular- were good. The fish was fresh and the only items that came across as overly fishy were the oysters. Many of the rolls on the menu had cream cheese in them, and based on the ones our table ordered a lot of them are the same base roll with different sauces. This may or may not bother you depending on your roll preferences.   The nice thing about Oyshi is that their sides as well as one dessert item are included in the AYCE. My hot green tea came in it's own pot, which was also cool. Service was fine, though the servers kept bringing by items that belonged to other tables (not a big deal; just make sure you keep tabs on what you ordered). The only reason I mention this is because Oyshi charges ala carte prices for leftovers like many other AYCE places, so having extra items delivered to your table could be problematic.   AYCE dinner is $28 with an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more. I personally won't be adding Oyshi to my sushi rotation, but I would recommend coming here  when you have a larger group due to the bigger capacity of the restaurant compared to other sushi places. They also take reservations.",

    "text": "The Oyshi on south rainbow blvd is one of our ultimate favorite sushi places in Vegas. Being closer to home, I swore this location would soon be one of my new frequent regulars. Needless to say, I have come here a handful of times but never had anything justifiable to review... on average could never give more than 3 stars, but after this sad encounter, I guess it's time since my rating for it has depleted.   I'm big on customer service & truly believe your server contributes to a large part of your dining experience. Our server's name was Junua, and I wish I could say one good thing about him. He was emotionless, unhelpful & scarce majority of our stay... to order or get refills from him was so difficult. It started with asking for more Splenda since all of the ones given were crunchy from being wet previously & dried. All downhill from there. The place wasn't even busy with only 4 other tables. No excuse honestly.  We ordered our usuals. I don't think it's bias, but the chefs here are just not as good as the rainbow Oyshi location. The ASIAN SKIRT STEAK was dry, the LOVE AFFAIR had not as much lobster & crab but excessive crunch flakes, and the AHI POKE was bland. The GREEN TEA PARFAIT had rock hard granola & was drenched with strawberry syrup. I couldn't even enjoy it. In terms of what was decent? The MONSTER ROLL, SPICY TUNA & SALMON NIGIRI were good.  Oh, they no longer have white tuna on their menu... and apparently there is a one order limit on their baked mussels and they have crossed out the \"multiple orders allowed\" on their ice cream? I thought this was all-you-can-eat? Lol. I think we are officially done with this place. Aside from the extremely cute decor and fun playlist, it's no wonder this place isn't busy on a Saturday.  *SIDENOTE: He had no name tag on (young black guy), but shoutout to the sweet busser who was friendly and far more accommodating than our server Junua ever was. Get that boy a raise! Our busser honestly is responsible for this being a 2 star rating instead of just 1! We appreciate you, sir.",

I know the Oyshi off Rainbow has a lively feel than this location.  The place was nice seemed bigger than the Oyshi off Rainbow. My friends and I had to eat all you can which was $27. Plus, they have $5 cocktails on Wednesday & Thursday!! The cocktails were $10 so it would be 50%. I ordered the Moscow mule it was very refreshing not as strong as the Yoshi Mojito or the Lychee?   As far as for the sushi it was no doubt bomb dot com! Especially the high roller... I love sushis with cream cheese it makes everything so tasty in my mouth. I'd recommend to come with a party if you're planning on eating all you can eat otherwise I'd just order my fave rolls to save a few bucks.   Our waitress was also the host Chloe, I'd say she was nice when it came to taking our orders she was very patient.",

Without diverting too much from the food, I would just like to say that there are a few unhappy people employed here, and it shows. It was pretty apparent that there is a lot of internal politics going on at this place. It made me feel very uncomfortable as a patron.... Aside from that, this place has decent food, a great selection of rolls, sushi and sashimi.      I counted forty signature rolls on there menu. My friend who visits the place frequently, suggested the \"High Roller.\" It did not disappoint. The screaming sauce had a small bite to it. The \"Nuclear Bomb\" was my favorite of the night. The crunch flakes (I think it was coconut) gave the roll a great taste! I was feeling a little brave so I also ordered the Sea urchin with quail egg. It didn't look very appealing, but it wasn't gross either. Come to think of it, it didn't have much flavor at all. It tasted like a sunny side up egg with some cold fish inside.      The service was okay. It started off pretty shaky, but the waiter opened up to us later in the night. I think he was having a bad day. The place is pretty clean and modern. They have plenty of adult drinks to choose from, along with a small bar near the entrance.",

Decent wait staff service. The guy behind their bar did their best to completely butcher irrashaimasen .  First thing I noticed is that I ordered the poke salad and the tuna that was in it was scrap tuna. Just the low quality end pieces that wouldn't look good if used as nigiri.  Then we got a roll we didn't order.  Then we were told that we couldn't order half rolls (the rainbow locations allows this) unless we were sitting at the bar... I'm still trying to figure out how this makes even a little bit of sense. We were told \" well you can order half rolls if you are sitting at the bar\". The bar was 2 feet to my right. The restaurant had 3 total tables occupied, it was dead... this didn't make any sense. We likely would of consumed twice as much had we been sitting at the bar.  Our waitress was a little forgetful. Didn't bring us drinks or even wasabi when asked.  All of our sushi would just fall apart. I even received ikura where my nori  WAS BACKWARDS. Will not be going to this location ever again.  2 stars instead of 1 because of the wait staff service and fresh fish- I ate there yesterday and am not sick at least.",

    "text": "THERE IS A SECOND LOCATION WITH MUCH BETTER SERVICE AT 7775 S. RAINBOW BLVD! Read my other review, go there instead if you can. Same great taste without the terrible service!  This is the only Sushi place I come to. I've tried a lot of sushi places in Las Vegas, but it's hard to find a place that tastes like it's right on the coast. I'm very picky about quality when it comes to sushi, it's not like a burger where you can deal with it being mediocre. I started coming to this place about three years ago when it was operating under another name, but it's always had the same great quality and taste.   One thing I will say I did not like before was the service. It seemed like they didn't assign a server to your table, so you would just have all these confused servers asking you what you wanted, or needed, and having your order come out with occasional mistakes, and the constant interruption of people not knowing when you were last checked on. It's gotten much better over the years and I can see business has picked up a lot.    I always tell my friends from out of town to try this place instead of somewhere on the strip which costs 3x as much.    To whom it may concern: keep up the great work in the kitchen, and focus on a more personalized floor experience. We don't want to have 5 servers for our table, just one really good one. Thanks for all the great food, we'll be seeing you.",

    "text": "AYCE sushi is equivalent to the happiest place on earth for me. I can't believe this was my first time here because they have so many appetizer, nigiri, and roll options. I'm seriously so impressed!   Sushi: great quality seafood. The fish to rice ratio is fair and not as generous as Sushi Neko, but the quality makes up for it. I tried the salmon, tuna, fresh scallop (A MUST), sweet shrimp, uni, oysters, and eel. Their appetizers are the best I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. I had ahi poke, shrimp tempura (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and mussels. The mussels were the worse because it wasn't creamy or flavorful enough.   Desserts: AMAZING! They have more than your usual ice creams and mochi ice creams, like a variety of creme brulees, tiramisu, etc. The green tea creme brulee was more like a flavored whip cream in my opinion; I like mine more thick and creamy but still sweet and good nonetheless.   Service: Kenny was our server and he was fantastic. It was super busy when we came in, but he still found time to be attentive and catered to us. He made conversation, suggestions when we were hesitant and deciding on what to order, and my favorite items were from his recommendations. Thanks for not judging me when I ordered like 10 items as my first order lol.   Overall: Oyshi is on my top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants. I can't complain with great service and quality fish. I'll definitely be back!",

Not sure if it's the refrigeration or the preparation method but this location needs to step up their game.

I will say that if you are into the AYCE sushi.... this is probably a great spot for you, they have a huge selection of rolls, sushi, appetizers, and I was pretty impressed when I saw the final bill.

The food ordered either didn't come or was mixed in with another plate (with somebody who's not even seated next to you). There were long wait times before your first and your second order (that's if you actually got what you ordered). We kindly pointed it out to the manager that we weren't getting the appropriate service and all she did was rush through some of the missing orders (and yes I said some because there were still other orders never came). After a while (an hour) it became comedic that one of the first rolls we ordered finally showed up (after telling the waitress no less than 5 times that it was missing). It was the crunch shrimp tempura roll (which, judging by amount of time it took for them to prepare, is apparently a complicated roll).   Overall this was not a good experience. The waitress was disorganized and bad and the manager was ineffective. The idea of an all you can eat sushi sounded good but this place is no where near worth the money you pay to eat there ($28 per person). Oh and the worst was we had to pay 18% gratuity since we were a party of 9. Needless to say they did not earn it.   Bonus: we asked for wasabi (since you know, we are eating sushi) and they brought us two HUGE mounds of wasabis bigger than a fist size for us to share. I mean who needs that much wasabi?!?!? Lol",

Just keep in mind that parties larger than 8 ppl would include a service fee.   All you can eat includes an appetizer, sushi, specialty rolls and dessert for $27 (dinner price). It does not include sashimi which is standard at most AYCE restaurants. We sat at the bar which was really the best place to be. We had the opportunity to talk to Chef Daniel who made some of his recommendations and made us some sushi rolls that were off the menu.  Honestly, his creations should be part of the menu as they were unique and excellent.   The appetizer menu was very extensive with plenty of options! Every single dish we tried was fresh and very tasty. The only roll I did not like was the spider roll. It appeared the eel was fried hours before and was not very fresh. Overall, I was very happy with the atmosphere, service and the quality of the food!",

We ordered from Vince our waiter and right away he said the rolls will \"take a while.\" We waited an hour and a half before finally checking on our order only to find out that they had forgotten to place our order altogether! Vince our waiter said \"oh I thought that someone delivered it already\" there was not a sorry or anything. Vince had no regard for our time and gave the impression that he couldn't care less. We asked to speak to the manager who said she would get our food delivered right away. Another 30 minutes passed before we even received our order. They then refused to comp any of the 4 AYCE meals. They did offer house sangria that \"was just made this morning\"   We arrived at 7:00pm were seated at 7:45pm and didn't leave until 10:16pm. Do not come here unless you have hours to spare. Such a bad experience for my family that I had brought here from out of town. Terrible!",

We finally placed our first round of AYCE sushi and it took almost an hour to not even get everything that we had ordered.  We finally had enough and decided to just figure out how much each individual order was and cover it with tax and left.  Here's the worst part, the server came out to get us as we got back to our car and told us we needed to pay the full price for the AYCE since we \"got food\" even though we barely got anything. Also that server who confronted us literally only talked to us once. Didn't bother to check in, and starting cussing us out saying he would have to pay for it out of his pocket. And then he turned around and said it wasn't even his table. Eventually we went back in and told the manager we weren't paying anything extra than the individual orders and she said ok.  Absolutely inexcusable. The kicker was that we went to McDonald's right after and they apologized for the wait when it would take 2 extra minutes for the fries to be ready.",

    "text": "Lunch $ 21.00 / Person - Dinner $ 26.00 / Person for AYCE.  Rice, rice, rice and a brick of rice in my belly. This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.  The menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.  Don't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor/ fish/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all.   The only redeeming dishes were: 1. Dynamite appetizer  2. Salmon belly nigiri 3. Baked mussels  4. Green tea creme brulee And that's it...  The service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.  In the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting.   In a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana.   Now, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening.",

Ambiance: 4 - The epitome of comfort: Tables that are far away from each other, enough to spread out your leg and arm span so that you won't hit another person. But still, not far away enough that you can't hear the conversations of the table next to you!   Spacious with more tables and semi-dimly lit, this Oyshi seems to have a bit more romantic lighting, if you will. Don't worry! You can still see your menu!!   Service: 5 - Our table service was fast, friendly, attentive. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so they were really able to cater!   Food: 3 - Just like their other location, they also offer AYCE and the choice of one of their specialty desserts!   I'm usually a huge fan of their food, but the quality of the rolls were just not as good as the original location! When the taste is up to speed, most likely I'll go back, but for now, I'll drive the longer drive to the first location.  However, if you do like this location and are looking for a roll to try, I recommend the Love Affair & the dessert is -always- worth a try! Also, if you like fresh oyster, theirs is delicious :)",

Were we greeted with a smile and told there was a wait. Then after we were seated the illusion were off an the nightmare started. Service was less to be desired an often times i was interupted with audible weird sound?? Feeling quite awkward I proceeded to order few sushi rolls and appetizers.  The shrimp tempura was not light and flaky. It tasted more like it coated with a heavy batter an was served not pipin hot but luke warm? The pink lady sushi roll look like my nephew (5yrs old) learned how to make sushi for the first time  The Pokie has three pieces of light colored Ahi Tuna with seaweed and abundance of white onion on the bottom.   Then to make matter worse 5 piece roll, coco roll, an mango roll all over sized pieces that could even fit in your mouth. The fish quality was very poor. Also tasted either salty or extremly sweet.  So i started to look around an noticed that the staff at the sushi bar; food runner who brought the food was just not in a pleasent mood.  They all seemed to give off a tired overworked type of mood. Waiter/waitress haphazardly put the plates anywhere and not clearing the table first of any dishes. My friend ordered the desert. She being brave (lol) ordered the green tea ice cream and that was overspun.   Inconclusion i had high hopes of this place especailly how inviting it seemed on the outside. Alas very disappointed and won't be dinning here anymore. Gave it 2 stars for hostess who greeted us promplty with a smile.",

The service we received was horrendous and there is nobody to blame except the owner because evidently she was also our server. I understand it is a busy holiday evening. However, we called prior to arriving and asked if they were  busy amd whether we needed to make a reservation. We were assured that they were not busy and we could just walk in. Once we arrived, we were informed that they were tremendously busy and we must wait at the bar. We proceeded to sit next to a minor and her father at the bar (which specifically states nobody under 21 is allowed.) Thereafter, once we were seated and orders placed, we were ignored- plates never cleared (AYCE) and water not filled, despite us asking. The mere reason for giving 3 STARS is due to the Sushi Counter chef, Pedro, whom made an otherwise disappointing experience tolerable.  We will contunue to visit the Rainbow location. Merry Christmas.",

Our waiter waited until our entire party was present before checking to see if we wanted to order. By the time we ordered and food was starting to come out, we were told that it was last call at 9:45 (they close at 10:30). I fm felt rushed and pressure to order more food to make sure I got my money's worth for AYCE. The rest of our food including dessert came out and by 10:15 the staff was mopping and cleaning around us. There were still at least 6 tables still eating while employees were rushing around trying to close up for the night.   I find this extremely unprofessional and terrible for service. Even though the food was good, I felt that I didn't enjoy it because I felt rushed. It was pretty clear that the patrons were being kicked out, the closer it got to 10:30, the more unwelcome I felt.   This location gets 2 stars only because the food is good but the service is horrendous.",

I'll walk in, then they'll tell me they're already cleaning so we can't eat there. Just avoid this hassle and go straight to the Rainbow location.

A lot of the reason we come is the atmosphere, though trust me the food is no disappointment AT ALL. Every time we come it feels like being around family. The people here are so personable, they do so well with choosing staff. I've never been treated any less than kind, no matter the flow of traffic. The AYCE is very well priced for the food you receive and it's easy to get caught up indulging with the amazing items to choose from. Each of the chefs here are magicians in their own right, Sam and Leo are great, but Ed is by far our go to guy! Where ever you find Nacho he's always fun & look for the name tag \"Golden\", I think he's the first person we grew fond of when we began coming here! I always recommend Oyshi when people are looking for a place to eat sushi and I don't plan on finding another one as long as we're in Vegas.",

There aren't many good ayce establishments in Las Vegas,  however Oyshi on Sahara stands out as a rarity. The fish is unusually fresh for ayce, the fusion rolls extremely creative, and the sushi chefs - starring Chefs Daniel, Pedro, and Curtis - are awesome guys that know what they're doing (they also have a sense of humor). Additonally, the servers have all been very friendly and everyone makes you feel really welcome.  This is the only ayce sushi restaurant I go to in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try. If you don't - or if you don't like it - then I hope you can rest at night, comfortable in the knowledge that you are everything that is wrong with America.",

Once the waiter got there, he was pleasant and attended to the table. Fresh selection of fish and very creative rolls. I would dine there again.",

The entrance way was so busy we have swim the thru the ppl who refused to make rm, walked up to the hostess counter... a waitress was scrambling around and didn't even acknowledge us! She was walked away and continued on with her shift... next the hostess steps in, grabs menus and walks off to the sea off ppl to seat them... all the while no one has said a word to our party. Then when she finally decides to grace us with her conversation she says it's an hour plus wait... no thanks... so my take on the food is I won't be eating it",

Our waiter was awesome and super laid back. We got along right off the bat and he was able to tell the bartender to make a whiskey sour although It wasn't on the drink menu. The waiters name is Kenny, he was really understanding after the over servers brought out the wrong food, and forgot to bring out some of the rolls we ordered. He was willing to not include it on the bill on his behalf, with no questions or hassle making us feel really relieved that we didn't have to try and finish these extra rolls that we didn't like nor order. Don't get me wrong the food is amazing, but there are some things I'm not interested in but every time I come I'm never disappointed in what I order.",

Has a good bar, neat little lounge area,and the sushi is decent for the price.  But I don't know if the service can be any slower. First time,restaurant half empty, took us (4 people) 30 minutes to get our first round of sushi.  After that the waitress disappeared and we didn't order the second round for another 20.  Last night there were two of us at the bar, again, the restaurant was 3/4th full.  First round of sushi came out fairly quickly, however our server Mono disappeared time after time as we sat there with no food, or empty glasses.  Lousy.  I guess it's my fault for thinking a second chance was needed.  Taking my business elsewhere.",
