We Ordered: I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar Sandwich with Fresh Fruit & Strawberry Lemonade. The bf ordered the Original Fried Chicken & Waffle, Waffle Fries & Strawberry Lemonade  Food: Everything is made from scratch here, and it's obvious from first bite. My breakfast sandwich was perfect in every way-- the waffle was fluffy yet crispy, the bacon flavorful and the egg cooked perfectly. I added maple syrup about half way through and was glad I did-- it accented the flavors perfectly.   I had a bite of the bf's chicken & waffle and it was very tasty! Slightly spicy, with the perfect crunch. The chicken was tender and the waffle was delicious .   The fruit was fresh (strawberries, bananas and pineapple) and the waffle fries were perfect.   Drinks: We both ordered the strawberry lemonade, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. It was clearly fresh & made from real ingredients. They had ice water available for free.   Value: Moderately priced, great value.   Thanks Bruxie, we'll be back!",

I specifically asked what was on the sandwich (I ordered the BBQ bun).  I was told slaw, fried onion, pickles, Bruxie sauce.  Asked for sauce on the side, no pickles.  I got an over cooked hockey puck that was fried in burnt grease, no slaw, all kinds of spicy bbq sauce all over the sandwich.  Took one bite and spit it out as I am extremely sensitive to spicy foods.  I still cannot feel my tongue.  Due to the fact that I am as sensitive as I am to foods, I always always ask what is on and in my order.  I am specific.  Never once was bbq mentioned.  Total flop and a huge disappointment.    ** consider having you employees who are running the register fully trained and ready to give accurate information.  I now get to skip lunch and pay for it.  So we went back after I called (months later) and it was ok.  The waffle fries we got were cold and it just isn't like the one in California.  Sorry guys I was hoping for a better experience.  I will improve the star rating but it wasn't over the top.",

The dressing, bacon bits and fries is so good I poured my normal fries into the pan to mix it up. Seriously loved everything they served. Do get an unsweetened tea from them, coz it can balance out the flavor. May not be too hungover friendly, but who cares. I'll definitely revisit next time when I'm in Vegas.",

Everything was so good from the chicken to the waffle itself. The only downside is that sauce comes on a lot of them which can make the waffle soggy and messy. I think I'll ask for the sauce on the side next time as the sauce was very good as well! Parking: if you love free parking (which is few and far between at LV hotels these days), I recommend parking at the Tropicana, taking the walking bridges over to NYNY, following the signs to \"the park\", and Bruxie is literally right out that door. It really wasn't too bad of a walk.  Then you can just walk right across the street to Tix4Tonight and get discount tix for shows!  Will definitely be coming here again to try more things off their menu.  Side note: you can get fried chicken and waffle fries with a waffle on the side too if waffle sandwiches aren't your thing.",

I only live once, my stomach will survive I think...  Odd hour already after dinner time so there were hardly anyone there. So lucky us we got to take our time to decide what we wanted although the menu wasn't huge or anything but as a newbie we were enticed to get everything or want everything. The food coming from the side looks so good. So the concept is you order at the cashier and they bring the food to you.   Tried the following  Nashville Style Hot Chicken & Waffle Sandwich: This was the hubbies favorite because of spice. I liked it too.  Original Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich: It was good, just original. I really like the extra flavors instead, but dang they cooked the chicken just right.  For both the Chicken was nice and crispy and tender at the same time. The Waffles were not what I expect it to be. I thought it was going to be like Roscoe's but it's not. These are different. Bread-like but crispy and thin. It taste light and not to carby.   It was the perfect bites I have had in awhile. Not oily at all. How do they do it? Perfect just perfect.   I want to come back and try the breakfast sandwiches and the desserts one day. Will need to come back and see if it's consistent to give it a 5 stars. YUMMY!",

Not sure I'm a huge waffle and chicken fan after this but I didn't hate it either.  Very soggy, I was anticipating having a sandwich, not a fork and knife meal.

The line was out the door, groups of teenagers satisfying their morning waffle cravings but the line moved pretty quickly. We were also able to find a table immediately and noticed that while the place was packed, people were still moving in and out and there was plenty of room for the incoming teenagers.   Food came fast, delivered right to our table, and when I asked where I can get some syrup, the waitress brought it over for us. We both ordered Holy Chickens and man what a combo! I've had chicken and waffles but never with an egg and bacon. My buddy described it as \"breathtaking\". This might be a new favorite. We are walking the same direction this morning as well, maybe we will pop in and grab another meal. If not today, I know we will be back soon!",

By the way if your confused about parking your best bet might be at the New York New York parking lot cut that's the closest parking lot, and you do have to pay for anything more than an hour. But back to the food, the line went by really fast, there was two cashiers. I ordered the Holy chicken. It was a waffle sandwich with a chicken in the middle with bacon an over easy egg and siracha sauce. Since it was my first time there I signed up for their loyalty program and got a free strawberry lemonade with my first purchase. The food didn't take long at all maybe 15-20 minutes. I grabbed syrup on the side and poured it on top. It was amazingggggg! I literally finished it in 5 minutes and the flavors went amazing together. Salty and sweet exactly how I like it. Their strawberry lemonade was A+ as well. My friend ordered their Irish nachos which was waffle fries with cheese and bacon bites and sour cream I think? And they were really good as well! I will definitely be back! And I loved the waffle irons on the wall in the dining area it was super interesting.",

They use chicken breasts, but they're nice and moist.  The Original had the perfect balance of sweet and savory. You can add seasoned fries and a drink for $3.95. The strawberry lemonade was refreshing, and they have a bunch of other house-made sodas. I'll be back the next time I'm in town!",

Parking situation sucks anywhere on the strip but if you are going to visit The Park,  I personally recommend parking at Monte Carlos parking garage.  There are ample seating inside. Limited outdoor seating available...but all of us Vegasians know the weather here. There's only about few weeks in a year that we get to comfortably be outdoor. Otherwise it's too cold or burning hot.   It's nice to have a casual eating spots like Bruxie on the strip, which serves fried chicken on a freshly made waffles. I got the original chicken and waffle which came out to be exactly $10 with tax. I personally think it's overpriced for such a small portion but just about everything is overpriced on the strip so what can I say.   I would say my chicken waffle was decent. Waffle was fresh and airy with little bit of sweetness. Chicken was crispy and went well with waffle. Had little bit of coleslaw which didn't do much in my opinion. Simple and good, but underwhelming in terms of portion. I would recommend ordering fries or other side dish if you are hungry.   Clean dining area, friendly staffs and good chicken waffles. I am a fan!",

I decided to try the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffle Sandwich, waffle fries and a \"Palmer\" (lemonade w/ iced tea).    The food arrived quick and looked impressive.  Not sure whose idea it was to make a waffle sandwich, but it's really hard to eat.  I'm not sure how you're supposed to eat this with your hands.  I ended up using a fork and knife cutting the pieces of chicken and waffle and dipping it in the maple syrup.  The waffle is light and crispy, similar to an Eggo.  The boneless chicken breast was crispy and juicy, though I was expecting it to be spicier and more heavily seasoned. The sandwich has pickles, lettuce and some kind of mayo, which I think is weird as I want to eat chicken and waffles with syrup.  Kind of wish there was an option to get just the chicken and waffle, not as a sandwich, though I'm sure you could request it.  The waffle fries were awesome and super crispy.  Even thought it was fast food style, the guy still came around to ask me how the food was and refilled my beverage.    The restaurant was spotless with tons of seating and TV's all around.  Came at dinner time and there was only one other family there.  Maybe people aren't hungry for hot chicken and waffles when it's 105 degrees out.  For the strip, I think Bruxie offers a pretty good value @ $14 for my meal.",

It's very hard not to stop by when walking through The Park. So many amazing places to choose from Bruxie is by fast one of the best waffle breakfast places in Las Vegas.",

Left a message on the corporate site, called and left a message for the manager, no response.  We make it a habit to visit, will NEVER go to Bruxie AGAIN!!!

I will say they did seem vegetarian friendly allowing subs of bacon for other veggie friendly ingredients.  i ordered chicken tenders and fries and my love ordered a sandwich with fries  The fries weren't that great... and the tenders were good, maybe a little dry leaning.  The pricing here isn't cheap so with their prices I'd expect something a bit better.  My husband ordered a sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was good, again nothing to write home about.  i didn't like that if I wanted a refill of tea, i had to go to the counter and wait.  I'd of preferred to refill myself as the place gets busy.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of waffles and you should be too!  Back in the day, The Strip lacked a lot of things, specifically good casual eating spots. Slowly, but surely the times are a changin' and Bruxie is the newest of the new when it comes to casual comfort food eating. I came to Bruxie and went hard, I ordered the Nashville Waffle Chicken Sandwich and the Bacon Mac n' Cheese bake.   The Nashville Waffle Sandwich, which by the way is a Vegas only option, mimics the Buffalo Bleu Sandwich, minus the gross Bleu cheese crumbles. I'm sorry if you like bleu cheese, but it's pretty much the devil in cheese form. The sandwich is a spicy fried chicken breast tossed in Buffalo Sauce, topped with a veggie slaw and two huge pickles on top. The hotness level was perfect, the sour dill mixed with the spice and light sweetness of the waffle really worked. Stoner Food. Level, Expert.   The Mac N' Cheese, was stellar; crunchy cheese on top with a gooey warm cheese center and big chunks of bacon. My only gripe about this is the portion size, for six dollars I felt like the dish it was served in could have been deeper. I mean this cost about as much as the sandwich itself.   Bruxie is a fun option while at the Park and just different enough to be worth your ever valuable dollar. The price point is set to Strip Prices, so be ready for sticker shock when you get the total, my meal alone was $25 with tip. Still, I would go back and try another, which my I'm leaving a four-star here.   Chicken + Waffles + Cheese + Bacon = I die.",

I was hoping there was a little more taste to the waffle or something different atleast.   In the end I ended up taking the chicken out and just eating the waffle and that was only because I was still hungry and the chicken just tasted like absolutely nothing.  It's a nice quick eat if you're around the area and just walking around, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",

My friend and I discovered Bruxie after leaving the NY NY hotel: None of the restaurants around the casino area really stood out to us. While walking towards the strip, we decided to give it a shot. I scanned the menu and was happy to see there was a burger available for me to enjoy. I chose the Mac and cheese instead of fries.  We sat down by one of the huge open windows facing the busy strip. When the server brought out my burger, immediately I was confused because I didn't order a waffle. Suddenly it hit me that even the burger was served atop waffles. I gave it a bite, and was very happy we chose Bruxie to have our last Vegas meal. The Mac could have been cheesier, which is my preference, but I was relieved it wasn't bland. I've noticed that happens at restaurants so often.  The cheese to patty ratio was on point and the waffle was crisp on the outside yet airy. It was a good balance for the beef. Definitely a win!",

Serving chicken in a waffle seems scary at first because I always associated them with sweet 'toppings'. Decided to go with the Nashville Chicken. It was absolutely delicious. Fried to perfection featuring an extra crunchy exterior and a tender juicy interior. Another really nice detail are the waffle shaped fries. Make sure you check them out while in Vegas.  I've already been 3 times in 1 week and I can't get enough. The second time I went I ordered the classic chicken skillet. It was good, I can't complain but my absolute favorite is the Nashville chicken. 3rd time I had it as strips with the waffle cut fries - absolutely mouthwatering. Have a meal here, seriously, you won't regret it!  Please open a restaurant in SF - I'll be your #1 client - that's a promise!",

    "text": "The next coolest thing to the newest entertainment attraction are the restaurants that open with the development. Take the Park for example. Inside the month-new Park at NY-NY, there is a hot new restaurant that opened up there called Bruxie. This past Saturday when my brother and I were hanging out in the Park, we decided on dining in Bruxie. My brother who dined in Bruxie once before recommended the chicken tenders. His convincing words to get me into Bruxie were,  \"The chicken fingers are better than Raisin Cane's.\" That was enough convincing.       Despite how delicious their chicken fingers are, Bruxie built it's reputation on waffles. The two founders Dean Simon and Kelly Mullarney turned the Belgian waffle into a grand slam ingredient featured in place of bread on sandwiches, as breakfast, and numerous items. When it comes to chicken tenders, the waffle fries are a home run that takes the taste out of the park.      Bruxie is one of the few restaurants to be located under the Empire State Building. When I stand a few feet from the Strip at the entrance to the Park, I see the NY-NY Empire State Building rising above the storefront. With the Empire State Building as a landmark there is little difficulty finding the first Bruxie outside of California.       As soon as I entered the two room eatery, I ordered at the counter. I decided on the chicken fingers with waffle fries, and sugar cane cola. I'd exchange close to $13 with the enthusiastic cashier for a buzzer. I'd wait in the patio room for a few minutes until the buzzer activated. No need to leave a table overlooking the spacious room that reminded me of a park lounge because an employee delivered the food to the table. I did have to inform him that I ordered a sugar cane cola which he soon delivered to the spacious table. This leads to the tip that the staff fills the cup in lieu of a self service beverage fountain.       I put Bruxie distant from the price gouging category to the \"You get your money worth on the Strip.\" The four chicken fingers were Big Foot size. These chicken fingers were giant and delicious just like Raisin Cane's. Sharing the tray with chicken fingers and waffle fries were Ranch and Carolina sauces. Missing was my favorite chicken side: cole slaw. The delicious cane sugar based cola complimented the food.      In conclusion, I enjoyed Bruxie. As far as comparing it to Raisin Cane's Chicken fingers they are tied. Bruxie left me with the lasting impression that they served me a tasty meal at an acceptable price for the Las Vegas Strip in the newest Las Vegas Strip attraction: The Park.",

It was definitely one of the less expensive meals we had in Vegas and made a great lunch. I would love to go back and try those creme brulee waffles...",

Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.  The chicken, although piping hot, was not that flavorful or juicy. I had the Original so maybe I should have had the BBQ which sounded good.  The Waffle \"bread\" was also pretty bland and was extremely crunchy, which I thought I would like but didn't work on the sandwich.    On the flip side, I ordered a chocolate shake and fries and they were both really good.",

    "text": "If you're not a waffle fan then stop reading!!! Just joking, but Bruxie is known for their chicken and waffles. Located on the Strip behind Shake Shack, this little shop offers their own spin on some classic American dishes. Of course, you can look up the menu yourself and see the specifics, but I'm here to give a review!   Be warned, this restaurant gets busy fast so be mindful of when you decide to visit. I came with a small group at around 7 p.m. and it was pretty busy. Then again, this is the Strip we're talking about so it's expected. This restaurant is self serve so the only service you receive is when you order and are given your food. My service wasn't good. The cashier that rang us up actually spent fifteen minutes talking to their friend who was ordering food in front of me. It was rude for not only me, but the customers behind us. The server that gave us our food also got our orders wrong. At least the restaurant has substantial seating space, so finding a seat shouldn't be hard especially if you're with a small group. My party and I used the tables with high chairs because it was next to a wall outlet. On a side note, thank God for restaurants that have wall outlets near the tables because when you're walking around all day on the strip, it really kills your battery.   Back to the review, the food took a while but it was a busy day so I don't hold them against that. When we did receive our food I was pretty excited. I ordered the Chicken Poutine which was their famous waffle fries topped with their home made chicken, cheese, white gravy and chives. If you haven't had poutine before, GO GET SOME RIGHT NOW! I'm a huge fan of poutine and their version was delicious. The cheese and gravy was ooey gooey good while their fries and chicken still maintained a small crunch to it. We also ordered the Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken & Waffles Sandwich,  the Original Fried Chicken & Waffles, and Chicken Tenders. They also offer syrup to go with the waffles and I recommend you try it. Their waffles are LEGIT. It's so soft and has a great flavor to it. The sweetness from the waffles and syrup really compliment the savory chicken. Their chicken isn't exceptional, but it still has good flavor. Really, their waffles are the star of this restaurant so you have to try it.",

Once I took my first bite, I thought I'd died and gone to chicken and waffle heaven. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffle was light and fluffy. It has slaw on it and I almost requested that it be left off because I'm usually not a fan. However, the slaw was tasty and doesn't take away from the deliciousness of the sandwich.   I ordered the vanilla cream soda to go with it and it was also delicious.  The bf thought it was too sweet but I thought it was perfect.   The only thing negative about Bruxie is that there's not one close to me! I could eat it every day!",

It was one of the best fried chicken I have had out. I had the chicken with chipotle honey sauce. It came with a bacon cheese waffle. The chicken was so crispy and moist. The waffle was to die for.  My boyfriend had the original chicken sandwich. The waffle for the sandwich was thinner than my waffle. He didn't really care for the slaw on it. I tasted it and thought it was good. Just a matter of taste I guess. There is no denying how good the actual chicken is though. We also had the mac and cheese. It was really good. Wish there was a Bruxie near our home.

Bruxie is located at The Park, the promenade connecting the Strip next to New York New York Hotel Casino with the T-Mobile Arena, home of the NHL Las Vegas Golden Knights. the Park is spacious, comfortable, great vibe, local artists painting everywhere, interesting sculptures and piped music.  Bruxie is a fun, modern place with a very friendly staff.  Lots of indoor seating with limited outdoor seating.  The line can be very intimidating but then you realize its not a line to be seated but an ordering line.  It takes a while, but once you order, the food comes pretty quick.  We had the Holy Chicken! waffle sandwich, waffle fries, slaw and a chocolate custard shake.  Came to about $27.  I never thought much of the whole chicken and waffle thing, having it only once before and not being impressed.  This, however, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblew.me&s=730d1b56d1911aa1446282c0e56b375f7fb87b77b3a26ee2af32cebbf4d3bcbf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blew.me</a>.away.  Crispy maple glazed chicken, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, sriracha sauce and a sunny side up egg, wedged between a soft and airy on the inside and crispy on the outside waffle.  It was perfect.  I was making noises with every bite, the noises you make when its so damn good.  It's been six hours and I can't stop thinking about it.  The waffle fries were crisp and lightly seasoned.  The slaw was crisp and creamy.  The shake was rich and thick.  There was everything right and nothing wrong with this meal.",

There was a good portion and they were crisp and juicy. he sauce was good and added to the taste of the chicken. Only 3 stars due to how slow we got our food.   Thank you for dining at Bruxie.

Located at the lobby level, outside \"The Park\" entrance part of the New York New York hotel and across the MGM, nestles this little place. I did not expect it to be take-out, but not take-out. So you walk-in and order it like a regular take-out place. You sit anywhere you'd like and your server will deliver your food to your table. So helpful and like regular dining service, they checks on us if we'd like more water (even tho self served) if we were okay (which we were) and to take our empty plates (which went full to empty real fast.)  Interior is pretty divey and hip with their brick walls and gorgeous view of the strip/terrace area. You can choose either high tops, benches, or lower shared tables.   We were served our food so beautifully crafted and definitely worthy of pictures.   -BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES: WOW, an original-tender and crispy chicken in a waffle sandwich topped with some good honey chilli sauce and slaw. I wanted to eat the whole thing, but needed to save room for the...  -CHEESE WAFFLE FRIES: What you would expecet, waffles fries with cheese on top served in a mini skillet. So cute! And yes, it was great!  -BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN COB: THIS. The next time I would go back to Vegas, I would definitely come back for this. It's regular cobb salad with avocado, egg, greens, and tomato BUT topped with their fried chicken specialty. Kind of healthy, but certainly flavorful! My anti-salad boyfriend even enjoyed it.  and for dessert....  -LEMON CREAM & BERRIES: The waffle was so good and so was the cream! Maybe to tarte and sweet for me.  -STRAWBERRY PALMER: Flavor is more lemonade and less tea.  I would love to come back and try their other fried chicken entrees!",

My brother in law got the original and my other brother in law got the holy chicken. I took one bite of his sandwich and holy chicken was it delicious! the waffle was nice and crispy, the egg was runny and creamy, the chicken had a crispy crunch... I wish I had gotten that sandwich, but I was still happy with my chicken tenders. sauce was a little runny, but still tasted great... definitely give this place a go!",

    "text": "Talk about spot that been meaning to get in for years. The biggest thing keep me away is not fan of hitting the strip between parking and more so enjoy little places off the strip more. Bruxie the concept of waffles with everything and anything imagine on top or between. Hell yay! Waffles by far one of my favorite breakfast foods. There was lot of hype about this place back when it open sometime ago. I excited to get my Bruxie on.......  Since I was going to check out the Armory nearby get some birthday gifts figure perfect time try Bruxie. First time wanted to try few things but only so much food one person can throw down. Lol! I ended up ordering the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar Sandwich. Also the Nutella & Banana Waffle. The Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar was perfect the breakfast sandwich to kick start the day. The egg was cooked perfect, bacon was nice crispy nice cut not super thin (worst if it to thin curls up and bacon should be nice strip of bacon), and the cheddar perfect compliment brings it all together. The Waffle.....The Waffle not only is the reason Bruxie made name for itself. Waffles are by far the best ever had in my lifetime. Not only appearance spot SPOT on. It beautiful golden color, looks nice light not heavy dense waffle, and first bite crispy outside then hot moist fluffy inside. I literally could eat just waffles by itself all day. I think there that good! The Nutella & Banana make sure have enough room for one more waffle. The combination in dessert waffle nirvana. Start not many places think of great dessert waffle. Nutella and Banana winnah. The waffle being hot out of the press melts the Nutella then throw in the cream spread and fresh slice banana. The powder sugar on the outside of the waffle. The first bite made complete mess out of my mouth. The powder sugar went all over my shirt. It worth it!!!! They have one more dessert waffle on the menu and no doubt going go back to try plus the stable chicken and waffles.  It like the fact that can sit outside or inside being that in park place. It great spot chill people watch. I mention earlier if fan of waffles Bruxie is must stop while in Vegas. The only thing that was bummed about that the sodas are only sugar cane based ones. Not fan of. They do sell other drinks out of bottles can get.   The service was five stars. Everyone from the person took my order to the person drops off your food. All smiles, friendly, and made my first time great time.",

I loved the chicken and waffle. The waffle had a nice crisp and the chicken as well, the combination was perfect!  The Angry mac n cheese was alright, the cheese was too thick if that's even a thing. Maybe too much flour on their cheese sauce?",

This year we ordered a variety: 4-piece chicken tender (OG seasoned w/ all three sauces; fries included), 2-piece fried chicken (1 original, 1 kickin'; bacon-cheddar waffle), and creme brulee dessert waffle. They were a perfect combo to try a little bit of everything and definitely worth the money.  Personal insight: To me, I favored the bacon-cheddar waffle over creme brulee since it tasted both savory and sweet (my sis on the other hand preferred creme brulee bc she wanted all sweet). Also prefer kickin' seasoning - love the spice and caramelized sauce.  TIP: Sign up for their rewards program to get free drink during first visit!",

The combination of a slightly sweet waffle with a fluffy interior and s light crunch to the outside followed by an egg and a fatty piece if bacon is heaven to me. I have the waffle fries as well. The service was fast and I left satisfied. Stop in while in Sin City and I promise you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Holy moly these waffles are fantastic.  The hardest decision at Bruxie is whether to go sweet or savory. But you really can't go wrong with anything that you order.  I took the sweet route and ordered a waffle sandwich stuffed with nutella, sweet cream and bananas. I also asked to add strawberries on... so like relatively healthy? Here's to hoping. The waffle was perfectly crunchy and sweet and came topped with a generous sprinkling of powdered sugar. Although I'd love to try some of their other menu items it'd be tough not to order this on a future trip. To drink I went with house made strawberry lemonade. You can also add champagne to this if you are feeling crazy... did not do this, and regret not doing this.   My fiance absolutely loves chicken and waffles and he was a big fan of Bruxie's take on it. This is a cheddar jalepeno waffle served with either two or three plump and crispy chicken strips with sides of honey and butter for dipping. So decadent and so delicious.   If it's a nice day take your waffles to go and eat them at one of the many tables in T-Mobile park. There aren't that many 'fast casual' options on the strip that aren't complete garbage, and food in the casinos is of course way overpriced. Bruxie was a nice happy medium, and a great option for snagging a quality breakfast on the strip.",

Would day this isn't a fancy type of brunch place, more a slow food kind of joint with family style seating...no real brunch type drinks but overall if you're in the mood for a quick and good breakfast it hits the spot...ordered the chicken and waffles with the sriracha sauce and maple syrup and found it to be solid. Waffles were crispy and maple syrup balanced well with the saltiness of the chicken...opted to also try the vegetarian option of the mushrooms and arugula which was decent and ordered a side of Mac n cheese with bacon which was good...most definitely would recommend this spot just wish they had more of a sit down brunch kinda menu ( bloody Mary's anyone???)...but hey, totally hit the spot and I'll happily come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

It's super close to the T-Mobile Arena. I came on a Thursday evening with my sisters! We ordered different things. The chicken tenders, the original and the Bruxie burger! All the sandwiches comes on waffle bread! Tasty! We also had a large order of the angry Mac n cheese! The tenders were okay but the sandwiches were way better! Definitely get a sandwich! The Mac n cheese was different, the buffalo sauce stands out for sure! We ordered strawberry lemonades for drinks. They were kind of small! But they had a water cup station. I was actually shocked that this place wasn't a sit down restaurant but you actually order first at the counter! Definitely worth trying!",

    "text": "The idea of chicken and waffles never really enticed me...until I had the opportunity to sample this combo at Parlay Gastropub (LI spot for those reading this who happen to live in Vegas). Just understand it became a concept I was open to...and then there was Bruxie which took things to another level.  Like, when I say another level I mean the top of the Stratosphere kind of level. Why not take thin, crispy waffles and fold them over to make chicken sandwiches? Why not fill them with crazy ingredients? Why didn't I think of this? Well I'm glad somebody did!  Bruxie, located in The Park on the side of New York New York, is something contemporary and cool enough to easily be found in the actual NYC (I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up there soon). I needed breakfast so what do I do? Yelp! Waffles? Chicken? Okay, that'll do.  But when I get there I don't just get chicken and waffles, no no no. At Bruxie things get interesting (in a good way). Holy chicken! That's the name of my breakfast-ish choice and it lived up to that name. Maple glazed chicken, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, Sriracha mayo, and a sunny side up egg.   Honestly, words can't describe this thing. Okay, I'll try to use words: Sweet. Savory. Spicy. Sexy (wait, maybe not that last one....or maybe.....). Anyway, it's just everything you want when you think of chicken and waffles. Add in some waffle fries (clever) and their own brewed coffee and you'll end up with a meal that'll do you in for the day.  Overall, I'll be thinking (dreaming?) about Bruxie for quite some time. The creative and amazing tastes they concoct (and their employees were a class act too) make this place a must. Yeah, I know there are 5-star restaurants and gourmet chefs aplenty, but go to Bruxie. Just do it and be ready for something you won't soon forget.",

The chicken is fried nicely that the oil residual is minimal as the skin is lightly battered and the inside is hot & tender.

    "text": "I'm glad that i stopped here and tried a different spin on chicken and waffles. I had the holy chicken sandwich with waffle fries and a strawberry lemonade. It was so good and left me full practically the entire day. I liked the mix of flavors between the maple glazed fried chicken, sriracha sauce, bacon, and egg. Dip it in some waffle syrup and you get this tasty sweet and salty mix with a little kick from the sriracha. I originally thought the waffle would be more fluffy and that the sandwich would break apart immediately as soon as I bit into it. It held together great and it's likely because of the waffle was a little crunchy on the outside and thinner than i'd expected. Overall the service was great, food was yummy, and you know it's not a bad choice when the line is out the door. Definitely a must eat if you're a fan of chicken and waffles.",

It's not really much room to eat off of and the syrups gets soaked up by the cardboard paper they have over the trey.",

The chicken was tender, juicy, and very well seasoned. It did not have that typical oily finish as you would think from a fried item. Biting into it there was an amazing bounce to the waffle and the chicken. The maple syrup sauce blended perfectly with the sandwich and gave it a nice sweet flavor without taking away from the crisp of the chicken and the waffle. The coleslaw worked very well in the sandwich by adding some extra crunch and tanginess. My only complaint is that my bottom waffle was a little thin, making the bottom fall apart as I was eating.  The Irish fries were good.. But they could have been better. The cheese on the fries tasted natural, but it was a little grainy and salty. This kind of overpowered the rest of the dish.  The service was impeccable! A few times I got out of my chair to get something (it's more of a order up front and get utensils and water yourself place) and a server stopped me and said he would get it for me). They took very good care of our every need! Servers also reminded me that there were free refills on my strawberry lemonade and not once did they let my cup go empty. Overall well worth a try and I will come back when I go back to Vegas.",

I went with the chicken and waffles, which is topped with cabbage and some sort of spicy-syrup deliciousness. The waffle and chicken were equally crunchy and yummy. The waffle fries were cooked to perfection, although someone may have gotten a little carried away with the salt, but it didn't deter me from finishing the entire thing. The strawberry lemonade was also amazing. Definitely not fast food preparation or pricing, but the quality is well worth the extra bucks! I'll definitely be visiting again.",

If your thinking about trying the place during rush hours -- call in the order!!  Nashville Tenders (5/5) seasoning was on point! Spicy with a great crisp! I'm definitely a chili-addict and tend to find most Nashville seasonings quite mild but this has a great kick and the heat builds after each tender.    Holy Chicken! (4.5/5) loved this sandwich and the portion is very generous! The flavors are all great, bacon is crispy, egg was perfectly sunny side -- just make sure to eat it fast because it starts to become a soggy mess once the syrup is introduced.  I would imagine this would taste the best 'dining in'.  I shared this with my boyfriend and glad I did, although the flavors are AMAZING it just gets a bit heavy after a few more bites~   Atmosphere is great and staff is friendly (did I mention the waffle fries were great too?) -- but like many places in Vegas there is limited seating, you may have to share a table with strangers but I'm all for an organic conversation!",

I was ready to give this place a 2 star rating until we got our Nutella banana dessert waffle. Crispy waffle, chocolatey Nutella, and sweet custard and bananas...it all just worked!(and for $5.25 this is a good deal!) Ambiance is urban garage picnic and prices are above expectation.

I had the Nashville Sandwich and it was the best. I usually have a hard time finishing my food but, I was the first to finish my plate. The portion sizes are great, if they gave you a whole waffle it would be too much. The pricing is about $11-$12 just for the sandwich alone. It is definitely worth checking out and grabbing a quick bite. I couldn't wait to eat my sandwich as you can see I took a bite before I could take a picture.",

Great for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner or late night. Fun dining experience. Accommodating staff.  This is one of those restaurants where you place your order at the register, grab your flatware and condiments, and they run drinks and food to your table with one of those buzzers. If seating is limited, take your order to go and sit outside on the orange chairs. (PS: Those vibrating buzzer don't reach the orange chairs. We asked.)  Drumroll please, now for the FOOD! Hubs had the Classic Chicken and Waffle sandwich with homemade slaw on it. I had the Buffalo Blue Chicken and Waffle sandwich with a celery and carrot slaw. WE LOVED IT! The waffles were light, airy and just buttery enough without being greasy. A little thinner than a Belgian waffle and better! Chicken was seasoned nice. Great taste. Crisp and still juicy. As for the waffles fries, wished we asked for them crispy. But no big deal. Just a little soft but we were really there for the Chix & Waffs, right?    We will be back. Maybe we'll order two sandwiches each. We enjoyed them that much!",

We all ordered one of their chicken and waffle sandwiches and they were amazing. When you get it, it may seem like it won't fill you up, but you'd be surprised with how dense everything is. However, it's not oily or over heavy as you'd expect from chicken and waffles. The waffle was perfectly made and the chicken was so well cooked with a nice fried skin on the outside with very juicy meat on the inside!  The service there was phenomenal! One of the workers refused to let me get up to get my own free refill and insisted to get it for me (note that at this place you just order at the front and they'll bring you the food so it's not exactly like a restaurant).   Be careful of the syrup because it is delicious, but it is prettttyyyy sticky and got a bit of it on my clothes xD",

The place is fun and friendly, two musts for an enjoyable experience, and I just looooove waffles, so of course Bruxie's is my go-to waffle joint.  My fave picks are the Bacon, Egg and Cheddar and the Lemon Cream with Berries... I have been known to go totally bonkers and have BOTH on the same visit (and then not eat for the next 48 hours)!!  Of course the Fried Chicken Waffle is a classic, and equally scrumptious, and so are the other waffle sandwiches, but I always seem to order the Bacon or the Lemon waffle and they are always, always the BEST part of my day. Waffles and cappuccino and a cold lemonade   The B.E.C has crispy, smoked bacon, a just-right runny egg, and the right amount of melted cheese to combine with the waffle in every bite and make you want to keep eating all day long.....  On the other hand, the silky slightly tart lemon creme with berries is a dance party in your mouth, hitting all the right notes and putting a Chesire-cat-like smile on your face. Words to the wise: Go to Bruxie's .",

When the food was ready it sat on the counter for a long time while the two girls whose job is to take it to the customers talked to each other about who knows what...Finally, one of them started bagging the order for me to take out. That process seemed to take longer then it should have. The girl couldn't figure out what bag to put it in, or she was just confused about something with take out orders. When we got the meals, the food had cooled down from the wait. Fried food is not that appetizing cold. The Strawberry Ice Tea was flavorless...The staff all look like high school kids that weren't into it. I didn't see anyone who looked like a manager supervising anyone. I can't imagine what it would be like if the place was busy. I'll give it another try to see if things change.",

The prices were okay, keeping in mind that this is food being served on the strip. The customer service was very good given the fact that their drinks are refillable only if a worker gets it for you, which We never had to ask a worker once because they were attentive enough to always ask us for a refill before our drinks were empty. The one thing that everyone needs to do when coming to this place is get some of the free syrup that they offer , which is next to the ketchup, and eat that with their waffles. The syrup was definitely one of the bigger reasons we liked the place. One big down side was the fact that our French fries were pretty cold. They weren't stale, but they did feel like they were waiting to be served for awhile. Overall however the place was very unique and a great place to eat at The Park.",

    "text": "HOLY MOLY... This place is LEGIT!!  My aunt went recently and highly recommended it for the chicken and waffles. Everyone knows I love my shake shack so it was tough for me to walk by shake shack and wait in line at Bruxie's. Probably the best decision of my recent trip though lol  Lines are always out the door, regardless of time, but they flow very well. I got \"the original\" that consisted of the chicken, waffle, syrup and some coleslaw. HOLY CRAP that was the best dang chicken and waffles I've ever tasted. Chicken was fresh and nicely cooked, waffle was warm and crispy and everything was just on point. Literally had a foodgasm in my mouth.. and that's not a bad thing!! Be prepared to use alot of napkins though due to the syrup lol  Also ordered my girls the kids meal and wow I was impressed at the portion size for the pricing. Plus they come with a drink.. yay.  This place was sooo good, I came back again. Walking 2 miles round trip was super worth it!  Anyway, I must add that I love the fact that they bring the food to you! I thought it would be one of those establishments where you come up to pick up the food when your buzzer goes off but I didn't notice that it's sensored and they know where you're at. BEST SERVICE YOU CAN GIVE! Also, they offered to help take some trash away when they notice you're almost done. OMG, I feel so spoiled!   Regardless of the time, this place is freakin awesome. Always has seating (unlike next door) and outside to lounge around in perfect weather is probably the best way to eat your meal. Love it! Can't wait to be back and I've been highly recommending it to anyone going to Vegas!!",

The waffle is very crispy, and the fried chicken coating takes a step past crispy into crunchy! I really enjoyed it.   The waffle fries were just okay, I would skip them and get tots instead if you want some potatoes on the side.   The strawberry lemonade was super delicious as well!

None of us got that, but we were very happy with our choices. The definitely take chicken and waffles to new heights. My waffle sandwich had chicken, bacon, cheese, sauce, and a sunny side up egg. Plus syrup. The spices tots were good, and the ability to add a small shake in a combo didn't disappoint as my chocolate peanut butter shake was awesome. Others got the chicken tenders and the chicken waffle sandwich that was loaded with Mac and cheese and other stuff. Everything was delicious.",

Finally got the chance to come in for a quick bite before heading to Caesars Palace for a wedding.   I kept it simple and ordered the bacon, egg, & cheddar waffle which was great. It's the only thing I got so I can't speak much to the menu but this was a solid dish. A bit smaller than I thought but I enjoyed it none the less and loved how they melted all the cheddar onto the waffle first. Will definitely give them another try in the future. Staff interactions were minimal but the few encounters hd were fine, not too packed the morning that we went either so we were able to eat inside and people watch a bit. Everyone who ate in my group seemed to enjoy there food. Recommended!",

We ordered the B.A.M.F, with a side of waffle fries and their dessert waffle. It is pretty pricey, but it's worth sharing it with someone. Taking the first bite, the chicken was juicy and tender. It was not at all hard to chew. The only down fall I really have is that it was a bit salty as you continue to eat. Maybe a bit less on the seasoning? But overall it was really good. Hubby love chicken and waffles, so once he heard he was so excited. We will be back if we're ever in the Vegas area again or we'll try the one in LA. Very good and half of it is already filling enough for one person! Can't wait to be back again soon!",

We ordered the original chicken and waffles, spicy chicken and waffles, and the holy chicken. All was very flavorful and delicious. I really enjoyed the spicy fried chicken, it had a good kick to it. Let's talk about the waffles! Great batter and portion, love the maple butter. The waffle is really different, there's like chives or green onions in it, which gave it superb flavor. I would totally recommend this place. Definitely one of the best highlight place to eat.",

Who doesn't like handheld food? You can sit and eat or take it on the go! But I wouldn't recommend that because once you add the syrup it can get a little sticky. But I preferred the loaded waffle fries!! I'll eat potato anything and these were amazing!   Not to mention the prices are very reasonable for the Las Vegas area when all the nice restaurants are $40+ per person. We will definitely visit here again next time we're in the area. Delicious!",

They connect with their customers in ways that are unmatched by any other restaurant. The food is better than Gordon Ramsey's cooking. Ces is one of the employees and has got the most beautiful smile anyone could have. Kevin will make you laugh and feel like you're at home  And Eva can make you feel like the most important person in the world. If I had all the money in the world I would eat at Bruxies every single day for the rest of my life. If I could bring one thing with me to a deserted island, it would be Bruxies.

I personally had The Classic sandwich and like I said everything was cooked perfectly. I found it to be a bit dry so I added a decent amount of syrup and hot sauce. The fries were also so good! Reminds me of chick fil-a. Food came in ten minutes, and the sandwiches are large and filling for roughly $11-$12. There's a party in my tummy - so yummy so yummy :D  Now as for the management I felt there is some definite room for improvement. The young lady who took my order was less than pleasant. She had lip piercings and super dark eye makeup, which is all good  but she genuinely just seemed like she was pissed off and hated everyone. She never smiled or recommended anything good to try. Just stood there as if I was doing her an inconvenience. I don't understand why she was the first person we saw when we entered the place, when they have amazing employees such an Vanessa (she brought out our food) who are happy, smiley and bring a good aura.   The tables were all dirty, we had to clean our own! Which is totally BS cause I could see a manager ( I assume) in a burgundy sweater just standing around in the back. There was one girl (I didn't get her name, but she was a young African American lady w/ her hair in a bun ) who was working her ass off! She never stopped moving the whole time I was there! Whenever she got a free moment she would wipe down a few tables and then go back to fulfilling milkshake/drink orders. I also saw her keeping up the restrooms. My point being, she was working 2x while manager stood around. I can't stand that.  The condiment area was lacking. Only one of the ketchup pumps worked and it was incredibly messy.  Although they did keep two water jugs out with cups - super awesome especially in summer time heat.   I probably won't make the trip here again as it was fun but not unforgettable. If I was a guest at New York New York I would 100% say check it out cause it's fun but for locals, just hit chick fil a.",

Customers are selfish and sit 2 at a 6 chair table. Staff doesnt say anything at all and will take your money and leave you to yourself for a seat. Also a lot of staff was wandering around but there was no clear guidance. I might be back but only to grab and go....some day  Update: They messaged me asking to explain and respond to an email? I did and no one responded lol. Really don't care because doesn't change my review. It was early opening and everything should have been right. It's close to T-MOBILE arena and should have their stuff together. Also there needs to be a sign giving clear direction of what to do. Order here, then take a seat. Or send a party member to save a seat because you will get cut off and order the food to dine in only to eat it in your car.",

    "text": "The spicy chicken waffle sandwich wasn't very spicy. So that was a bummer but the flavor was good.  I think I'm being picky because I've had better fried chicken. Buuut, I will say that the waffle was pretty delicious. Perfect crispy texture on the outside while having that thin light fluffy interior you expect from waffles on the inside.  They have their waffles DOWN. The fried chicken is just not the best that I've had.  I will say though, I love the concept of the restaurant. Waffle sandwiches stuffed with fried chicken? What's not to love?  This place isn't perfect. It's not the best sandwich I've ever hand. It's not a sandwich that I couldn't dare to dream without. But you can't really go wrong with a fried chicken/waffle pairing and this place does it pretty well.  3 stars because I wouldn't really go out of my way to come here. But if you were in the area, it wouldn't be a bad choice for a meal.",

We usually get there around brunch time, so the line tends to be long and out the door but it moves quickly. You order at the counter, and the food is brought out to you once it's ready. My favorite is the crispy chicken waffle sandwich! The waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the chicken is well seasoned and crispy without losing any of the juiciness. The spiced tots are a yummy add on too!",

The chicken and waffle was flavorful throughout my meal. The waffle was thin like almost the size of bread. Compared to other waffles I have tasted in the past, this waffle maintained its crunch. I'm not a fan of fluffy foods unless it is dessert so eating a crunchy waffle really makes me smile.   If you are with people who do not like chicken, they do offer a plain waffle option as well.",

Chicken was breaded wonderful and tasted great with the help of the hot sauce they provide. Waffle was probably one of the best waffles I've ever had! It was a little crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy in the inside. I also got an order of fried pickles because who doesn't love fried pickles?! They also came out really hot and tasted so fresh! The only thing about them was that they were a little big but that wasn't even a problem because the taste definitely made up for that. Most definitely coming back and encourage everyone to at least try this place 1 time!",

It's everything I look for in fried chicken and waffles (in a sandwich form) -- crunchy texture, well seasoned, a little heat, crispy waffle. I'm a fan and can't wait to go back for more.  My kid on the other hand, didn't like it as much as I did. His young palate wasn't crazy about the peppery coating on the kid's chicken tenders and couldn't eat more than one bite.

    "text": "Having always been a fan of Bruxie, I was excited to see that Vegas now has one located right next to Shake Shack! It's been a while since I've had a delicious chicken and waffle sandwich and Bruxie sure did deliver. I ordered the Nashville Style Hot waffle sandwich which included a nice and juicy fried chicken thigh with shredded lettuce, pickles, and a nice tangy sauce to top it off. I opted out of the pickles since I'm not a fan, but everything else about the sandwich was just so delightful, I loved it. The waffle was soft, fluffy, and not too thick so you wouldn't get tired of it easily.  The chicken was fried to perfection and since it was dark meat, it wasn't dry at all. A couple days late on this review, I'm definitely starting to drool as I'm trying to remember every bite I had.   As if the chicken sandwich alone wasn't enough, I tempted myself to get a kids meal with a small order of waffle cut fries and mac n cheese. I wanted to get both as sides but fearing that the side orders would be too much, I ordered the kids meal thinking the portions would be smaller. Not sure if this is the case, but it definitely was the right amount for me! You also get a kids cup of either lemonade, soda, or milk with it. Both the fries and mac n cheese were bomb, if you happen to be on the fence like me - I say just do it!   Having ordered way too much food already, I had to mentally stop myself from getting one of their sweet waffles. The Creme Brulee waffle looked so heavenly and luscious, I definitely died a little inside... But it's okay, this just gives me another reason to be back next time!   Service was good, not great. After you order they give you what looks like a pager or buzzer, but it actually doesn't buzz. It has a number on it and once your order is ready, the workers call out your number and after spotting you, they walk over to hand you your order. This might be more efficient inside, but since we sat outside, it was a little unorganized. I think having an actual buzzer and just having customers walk up to pick up their order would be much easier. They forgot my fries and drink and I had to walk back to the counter to ask for it. It's no big deal, but I think it's easier to just pick everything up all at once at the counter than having the workers struggle with bringing everything out to you. But regardless, the workers were really friendly and got me my fries and drink right away!  Overall, I totally recommend if you're a waffle lover!",

My order was the Nashville Hot and that was a really good pick. Idk what kind of sauce that was but it was a really good mix of flaver and spicyness. Along with it was the pickle in it which made a really big difference. A thin slice of the pickle was all it needed. This a by far the beat waffle sandwich i have had personally. I also tried my friends order which was the original. It was good as well but for my personal taste it was a bit sweet. We hinestly thought if they added a pickle it would have upped the flavor.  It was a really good place having a patio. If you wanted to stay inside and look outside you have that option.  The people who worked there seemed very nice a d bring your order promptly. I have no complaints abkit Bruxie at all and i cant wait to go again. I really like that in our day and age that a chicke. Waffle sandwich is an option. Greag job and thank you Bruxie!",

It took us only 5-10 minutes to order and we ordered the \"Holy Chicken\" it came with cheese, applewood bacon, an egg and the thick juicy flavorful chicken. Every flavor complemented each other no extra sauce needed. The sandwich itself is very filling and the chicken was extremely thick. We will definitely be coming back if we are on the strip.",

The Park was extremely busy, and Bruxie's line was pretty long. We waited for about 20 minutes and ordered. The cashier only put in one order of the original fried chicken and waffle instead of two. So we had to go through a whole process of putting in a second order. First order came pretty quickly but the second order didn't come until someone checked on us if we were waiting on anything else. However, they were all really helpful and constantly checked on us. Even though the ordering process was a little out of order, their excellent customer service had completely sold me. The sandwich was really fresh, chicken was super tender and juicy, and the vanilla cream soda was to die for. Bruxie, I'll be back for you!",

Of course chicken and waffles is not a new concept but the spin Bruxie puts on its creates a whole different experience. The waffles themselves are crisp and freshly baked. Initially I wasn't sure how I would like it but they were crisp and light not crisp and stiff! It made for a great waffle sandwich. The chicken was delicious and very nicely fried. I got the original chicken and waffle combo and my date got the Nashville Hot chicken combo. The original waffle sandwich comes with a chicken breast dressed with chili honey, slaw and I added pickle. The Nashville comes with a chicken thigh dressed in a tangy sauce and slaw. Both were amazingly good! The combos come with fries which were also good. We spilt an order of fried green pickles, yes our eyes were bigger than our mouths! More than enough food and wasn't able to finish them. The combo is a little pricey but worth every penny for this killer combo and you may even have a little to take home!",

I've tried plenty. My fav so far is the bruxie burger with BBQ sauce. An employee recommended the pastrami and Swiss. I loved it too. I've tried plenty and nothing is not good. Next time I want to try the Nashville hot.  The crisscut fries and excellent as well. I didn't like the buffalo fries but my brother loved it. I really enjoy the cheese fries with added sriracha.   Serivce is excellent as always and btw if your reading this order the strawberry lemonade! It's free refills are a plus but the drink is AMAZING!   The location is perfect.

    "text": "Not really sure what they hype is with this place.  I guess it's the concept of chicken & waffles in a sandwich form.  The chicken was moist and had a nice crunch to it.  The waffles was light and thin.  I guess I'm not a big fan of it being in a sandwich form.  I would rather it be in the traditional form where I can slab the waffle with butter and just pour on the syrup myself.  The chicken didn't really have that much flavor to it.  I guess it got overshadowed by the syrup and coleslaw.  I am also not a big fan of their cane sodas.  It gives the soda a different taste than I am used to with the Coke products.",

Tried the Original Chicken and Waffle and Mac n Cheese, the chicken was pretty good but Mac n Cheese wasnt so special.   Some of the staff's service was just bad vibes. FOUND A HAIR in my mac n cheese after a couple a bites, told the nearest worker about but she just looked at me as if it wasnt a concern. She came back with another plate of MnC said sorry but honestly it wasnt even genuine. Pretty sure not all of them are like that, told another employee Derek about the situation but was glad he cared about our satisfaction and truly gave an apology.",

    "text": "I'm normally not a fan of Chicken and Waffles only because other places I have tried such as (Roscoes Chicken & Waffles) were over pried and greasy or just was too salty and not crispy.   Decided to try Bruxie because I read somewhere that they were pretty good and also since we came to check out the new T-Mobil Arena. Staff was friendly and although it was pretty busy we only waited about 10 min for our order .  The Chicken was very tasty and not as great as I was expecting which is a plus.   Waffles were so moist and yummy . I just wish the Savory Waffle that came with my chicken and waffle skillet order was bigger or they could have given 2 pieces rather than 1 for the amount of chicken it had.   Over all , prices are decent or what you expect for food on the strip . I would defiantly eat here here again. I got back to my moms house wishing I had placed a to-go order.   Wished they had this place in the Bay Area where I'm from but I guess it's a good thing they don't or else I'll be broke and obese if I ate this everyday.. Lol   Try it , you won't be disappointed!!",

The Mac had some descent flavor and was cooked well. The loaded waffle fries were a little under cooked. Waffle fries should be kinda crispy and these were not. Close to soggy but not quite. Flavor was typical for loaded fries. Overalls it was a great brunch. Worth checking out for sure.",

It's tucked in away from the Blvd, there's lots of greenery and the architecture of the arena and the nearby structures was gorgeous.  I was late to the Chicken and Waffles party. I never had them much before. I opted for that Nashville Hot chicken waffle sandwich. I was sold on the heat of it plus a tangy sauce with pickles seemed to make a more complete sandwich than their original Chicken Waffle Sandwich (which seems to only include slaw).   The waffle held up pretty well for the chicken sandwich. It was only near the end where the tangy sauce and the chicken proved too much for the waffle. Waffle could have been cooked a little more to prevent sogginess. The tangy sauce was fantastic touch to the heat of the chicken. Chicken was juicy and rich. The waffle sandwich runs you about $12 by itself but I was very pleased with the sandwich, plus it's still cheaper than getting a good beer in T-Mobile arena. I did eat some chicken tenders from my buddy, that was a little more of a miss. The breading fell off the tender too easily, although the chicken itself was still juicy and delicious.  It was a great pre-wrasslin food. Definitely worth a shot for that delicious delicious chicken and waffles sandwich.",

I did not expect to like it when I first walked in - I am more of a savory and salty kind of person, rather than being inclined to sweet stuff. And naturally, waffles were sweet in my mind. Until Bruxie's!   The waffle was puffy and crunchy in just the right amount. Paired with a Nashville Crispy Chicken and waffle shaped (real) potato fries, the waffle suddenly became a savory food. One I went back to, not just once but twice in the next two days. What was a potentially disastrous experiment for me, became an amazing experience!  I even tried the sugary waffle. Mouth-watering. You need to try both types - sweet and savory - when going there. Oh, and going with the combo is for sure the best choice!   Don't miss it out when in Vegas! The Park is a must-see on The Strip, and Bruxie's is just there in-between New York - New York and Monte Carlo. Just stop and have a seat inside or outside and enjoy the view and more than anything the food. It's like nothing you've tasted before.",

If this is your first time trying Bruxie I'm sorry you had to go to this location the ones in California are way better way more hospitable sand HOT FOOD! SMH! Eat at your own risk! Pretty sure every other place on the strip literally has the basics which is HOT FOOD and better customer service! Terrible establishment! Called prior about allergic options was told everything is good and they had options for all. Soon as we get there and ask it's a different story no options they basically laughed in our face! When telling the manager he said he would take care of it I go sit down I look up and the manager is gone disappeared into thin air! Didn't know they did magic at Bruxie as well!! Smh just horrible man! Gotta get y'all selves together here! Never will I be back at this trash establishment!!",

    "text": "This is not your typical chicken and waffle restaurant that are now fairly common. It's a utterly modern update on a concept I thought was complete.  Location: Bruxie is located in the NYNY hotel side of the NYNY, TMOBILE arena, Monte Carlo trifecta. It has indoor modern tech style seating as well as a small outdoor bar type seating area. The outdoor seating  can accommodate up to 10 people with 5 seats on each side with a heating/cooling mechanism above the seating.  Menu: chicken, chicken, more chicken, and a waffle. You can your chicken however you like, to many options to name. I was with a fairly picky eater who opted to have his sandwich \"deconstructed\" which allows everything to be presented separately so you can decide what to add or take away. Your items are brought to the table when ready. I had the tenders/fries. The tenders were fried to a crisp perfection as were the waffle fries. They were seasoned enough to be tasteful but not over bearing. They offered plenty of accompaniments to add as well.  Price: reasonable and fair averaging $9 per item.  Drinks: the had a selection of beers I wasn't familiar with. I'm not a fan, but for those that are in sure this is exciting. They hand craft all of their sodas. I had the root beer which was absolutely delicious.  Overview: I'm come back any time. The service was excellent, the location perfect, and the food delicious.",

For whatever reason, they have 2 cash registers but only chose to operate one that day.  I don't understand this at all.  I would assume that Sunday mornings were a normally busy time so why were they not prepared to handle the crowd?  Anyway - on to the food.  Just ok.  I LOVE Nashville hot chicken, so I was super excited to try out the hot chicken and waffles sandwich.  The waffle - very good.  Hot chicken...not so good.  It was super sweet and not what I was really looking for, although I thought the slaw was tasty.  The quality of the chicken was great, very moist, I just didn't love the hot chicken flavor.  My wife got the original and basically gave the same review.  Super super sweet but good waffle and good quality chicken.  Oh yeah - the coffee - DO NOT GET IT.  -3 out of 5 stars.  Burnt, bitter, worst gas station coffee we've ever had.  There was not enough cream/sugar in the building that could have made it taste remotely good.  We may or may not try it again, possibly at a different time of the day to see if anything changed.",

We stopped at this place, located at the New York New York Hotel and line was already building, so we thought \"why not!\". I ordered the Holy Chicken sandwich which had a poached egg, chicken breast, sriracha mayo and of course a waffle as the buns.   When I took my first bite, I was absolutely amazed at how perfect the chicken was. It wasn't undercooked, overcooked, NOTHING! The meat and seasoning was ridiculously good, and the combination of that with the egg and Sriracha mayo made it one hell of a breakfast sandwich.  My only flaw was I paid 20 dollars for a sandwich, small coke and a side of fruit (that came with the sandwich). Seems overpriced as hell, but It was good.",

Came in for lunch and had to try their original chicken and waffle sandwich. Hubby had their hot pastrami and Swiss. We also tried their strawberry lemonade, waffle fries, and mac and cheese.  Maybe I have a giant stomach but I didn't find the sandwich that big. I had plenty of room for sides after eating the sandwich.  Both sandwiches were great - messy but super tasty. Waffles were nice and light and the meats were nicely done. Crispy but not too greasy. Waffle fries were average. Mac and cheese was below average - kind of reminded me of a cheese whiz. Would skip that for sure. Loved the strawberry lemonade! Nice balance against the saltiness of the rest of the meal.  Priced at $10/sandwich and about $3-4/side. Casual option where you order at the counter and take your food once it's ready. Items are made fresh to order.",

I ordered the Nashville Style Hot Chicken Sandwich, Lemon Cream & Berries and Strawberry Lemonade.  Food was delicious and good size portions.  I couldn't even finish half and was pretty hungry.  What really put it over the top for me was the customer service.  They were genuinely friendly and nice.  I was asked several times if I wanted a refill on my lemonade, asked how my food was, they took my food and tray for me when I was done, even after I insisted I would do it myself and it was all done in a friendly sincere way.  That kind of service is rare for me for quick service/casual places in Vegas and what gives them 5 stars instead of 4 from me.",

The waffles are the perfect texture and consistency, just the right weight to hold your chicken. The chicken is so crispy and juicy and surprisingly packed with flavor. I dumped syrup all over the sandwiches each time I went and it just adds such a unique flavor. I get the Arnold Palmer, (can't remember if they had a different name for it over there?).. and it's delicious. It has strawberries in it and it just tastes super fresh. If you are staying at one of the nearby casinos or just at an event at Tmobile arena, definitely stop by here!",

My husband said there was a slight hint of syrup but wasn't sure if was baked into the waffle or added as a drizzle. It came with waffle cut fries.   Both items were very large servings with fresh ingredients. The chicken was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, and the fries were crispy and hot.   Very enjoyable.

We made a mental note to try it sometime. We decided to go there for a late breakfast the next day and are so happy we did! We both got the breakfast sandwich and loved them. The waffles are so light and yummy with just enough crunch. I was disappointed because I had looked at the menu online and was so excited because I wanted to try the Pastrami sandwich and they don't have it at the Las Vegas location. Also I read about the secret dessert and I was too full to order it. Next time for sure!! Service was fast, seating is plenty and the atmosphere is nice. Huge fans to cool you inside and misters outside. Good music playing. We will definitely go back!",

The Holy Chicken sandwich was really good, however I felt it somewhat lacked in value for the price tag of $13.50.

It was goodly-sized and filled with a nice amount of bacon, egg, and cheese, while remaining reasonably-priced especially given its center Strip location in the brand-new Park. Service was fast and friendly.  I felt we received outstanding value.  In the \"bang for the buck\" breakfast comparison with Eggslut (I like Eggslut a lot), for me, Bruxie wins hands down.",

We arrived around 11am on Saturday which apparently is one of their busiest times of the day, but thankfully once we got there the line was short. Seating is very limited but since it is fast casual, most of the seats clear up after patrons are done with their meals. We were able to secure a table of four after a 3-5 min wait. I ordered their new Holy Cow waffle sandwich. Although I wasn't too sure about having it with egg, I'm glad I did. This gives it a good sweet to savory ratio. I also ordered a side of Angry Mac and Cheese. This is a must. It is cheesy, with a zesty buffalo taste. My friend ordered their bacon waffle and this was amazing! It melts right in your mouth.",

The waffle was super crunchy and reminded me of eating toast instead of waffles. The waffle was not sweet at all and a little larger than the frozen waffles I see at a grocery store.  It broke very easily when I took a bite.  The chicken was super crispy, but very salty. I felt like drinking a lot of water after eating the whole sandwich.  I liked how there was a lot of lettuce and tomato slices.   The sandwich was very messy and a lot of the sauce would come out.   This place was decent, but I have been to better chicken sandwich places.",

    "text": "What's better than chicken and waffles? CHICKEN AND WAFFLES SANDWICH!! I've been wanting to try Bruxie after walking past it while strolling around the strip. There was a poster of their \"Holy Chicken!\" sandwich outside of the restaurant and I was tempted to try it out for my first time. This sandwich consists of the fried chicken (maple glazed), bacon, cheese, Sriracha sauce, with Sunny-Side Up egg along with the waffles. Bruxie does an amazing job making the waffle crispy thin and not too heavy to go along with the chicken. If you're more of a waffle person than a chicken person, I probably wouldn't recommend it because the waffles are crispier and thin rather than fluffy and sweet!  Their servings are pretty huge but you also get what you paid for as this sandwich was around $13 (YIKES)! I also tried their \"Palmer\" drink and it was perfect since it was not too sweet.   I came around 11:30-ish am and it wasn't that packed but by the time I left, there was a line out the door around 12pm so I would try to go before noon. There are plenty of seats outside and inside but I can definitely see this place getting packed throughout the day when it would be hard to find a seat.   The process to order and eat is pretty fast and easy. You receive a buzzer while acts like a tracker for the servers to find the table and deliver the food to you! I love this concept because you don't actually have to get up and pick-up your food.   I gave this place a 4/5 because I felt that this place was a boujee way of incorporating soul food for hipsters to like, it wasn't anything too special that \"wow'd\" me. Overall, I'm a big fan! I definitely will want to come back and try out all their other sandwiches!",

Gotta try everything while you're in Vegas right??).  The waffle is crispy on the outside and light and fluffy in texture.  Chicken was perfectly seasoned, moist and not overly fried.  Bacon had the right thickness and well, nothing can ever be bad about it! The surprise was the sriracha mayo - I personally don't eat spicy but the sriracha mayo was lightly sweetened with a kick and went really well with this sandwich! Two thumbs up - I will have it again next time I'm in Vegas!",

The pure maple syrup in the middle of the desert is kind of funny but of great quality.  I had the chicken strips, one of them was slightly over cooked but the rest were super tender.  The tots were very very good as well.  The only super minor draw back I saw was the tables are bolted on and there is only table for a party of more than 4 being on the same table (you can sit kind of together with gaps).",

    "text": "Some people steer away from places like these because of the \"hype\" but I think Bruxie lives up to its name. Living in the Bay Area, the closest one would be LA. I frequently visit Las Vegas, and I always find myself at Bruxie at least once on my vacation.  Everything I've ordered so far has been delicious - the original chicken sandwich, Irish nachos, chicken tenders, etc. So many different options! The waffles are perfect substitutes from your typical bun or bread. Chicken comes out piping hot and crispy. Sauces and slaw add flavor and an extra depth of texture.  I'm a huge fan or Chick-Fil-A, but Bruxie wins with their waffle fries. Always crispy and fresh. If you like them loaded, try the Irish nachos! Cheese, sour cream, bacon. Yum.  A typical order of one sandwich and an order of Irish nachos is perfect to share between two people. Depending on when you come, the lines could be out the door or nonexistent. It's typically more busy around brunch.  Decent portions. Crispy waffle fries. Real cane sugar sodas. Free refills (just ask). Bruxie, please open one closer to home.",

Delicious Cluckin BBQ Chicken Sandwich($12.95); a lot going on between two sauces, slaw, pickles, crispy onion strings, & a substantial Portuguese bun, but not overwhelmingly so.   I didn't try her Holy Chicken! Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($14.50) but the combination of a cheese-covered waffle, runny egg, & applewood smoked bacon cradling maple glazed fried chicken got my breakfast companions' approval.   He ordered Chicken & Waffles ($11.25) & best believe I stole bites of his side of tots, sips of his extra buttery (I don't know how else to describe it) Strawberry Shorty Shake, & damn-near half of his butter & maple syrup-topped waffle. I'm clearly not one of those girlfriends whose scared to eat in front of her boo.   Casual breakfast spot outside of New York New York. Order at the counter; grab your own water, utensils, & condiments; food is brought to your table. Friendly staff, reasonable prices. Thx for a decadent first meal, Bruxie!",

I have like 3 Bruxies near my house, so I can pretty much get my fill whenever I want to.   We were staying at a Hotel across the street and were cutting it kinda close to check out time.  No worries, we ran across the street and got a quick bite to eat.  I LOVED this breakfast Sammy.  I got the Egg, cheddar and bacon on a waffle, and my husband got the chicken, egg, cheese and bacon on a waffle.  His had a sirracha mayo on it, and he said it was a plenty spicy sandwich.   The waffles were really crispy, and delicious.  I may have to re-think my view of LV Bruxie, because I will most certainly be back.",

The server was so nice they were able to cut into 3 pieces for us, it was actually good size for all of us to share and we were full for a while too.    I like the fried chicken waffle sandwich, the chicken was very tender and the flavor was just right.  Never had mac & cheese inside of a sandwich, and their mac & cheese was on point.  I think if we have one more person I would have just got the mac & cheese on the side to share. next time.   This is the type where you pay first and find your own table spot.  we got lucky and we found this long table for the 3 of us.  As we were leaving, there was a long line waiting for tables, come early, so you can get a table.",

There were other people waiting outside then too so it's definitely a popular place!   I ordered the Holy Chicken sandwich with waffle fries as a side and a coffee. The sandwich looked amazing!!! It also tasted amazing! The chicken was cooked really well and the waffle and chicken and bacon was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The waffle fries were great and the coffee was also (surprisingly) very good! This is a must stop-by place on the strip!",

When you have all the other delicious options in Las Vegas, Bruxie probably doesn't make the cut for me as something to write home about.   The chicken was really crunchy and well seasoned, which I really liked. I found the waffle to be overly moist to the point of sogginess. My sandwich, however, did have pretty good balance of flavors and textures. I will say this-- get their vanilla latte!!! Seriously. It's the best vanilla latte I've ever had. I would go back over and over, but solely for the vanilla latte.",

We had the chicken tenders with fries (the original seasoning) and their strawberry creme brulee waffle and OMG everything was so delicious! Plus the prices were reasonable and our food arrived relatively quickly upon ordering even though the place was busy, so nothing to complain about really.  The tenders were perfectly cooked, the seasoning was tasty, but the best part was definitely the waffle. Even though I'm a huge Nutella fan we wanted to try something different so went with the strawberry creme brulee and were not disappointed! Definitely could be shared between 2 people. I guess the one downside is our waffle got a bit cold as we were eating our chicken, but I can't imagine how much better it would've been if it were warmer since it was still fantastic while cold! It had plenty of strawberries in it, all bite sized, and the amount of creme brulee to waffle ratio was perfect.   So anyway, highly recommended for a quick lunch, especially if you're craving some delicious fried chicken and waffles that are filling and also one that won't destroy your wallet like a majority of places in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is a fast food joint with amazing Chicken and Waffles. My friend and I were walking down the strip just to get some fresh air. We found a long line outside of this food establishment. I quickly checked Yelp to see what others were saying about this place. I read mostly good reviews. As I finished reading some reviews, my friend and I noticed that the line was moving quite quickly.   We decided to get in the line and order something to share to see what the hype was about. As we had previously just had a meal an hour before coming here, we figure we would get something simple. We ordered the plain chicken and waffles without any sides.   We walked back to the hotel and divided our chicken and waffle in half. One bit in and I knew I had a winner in my mouth. The waffle was so crispy. The chicken was crispy on the outside and extremely tender and moist on the inside. The chicken batter had some spice and something a little sweet in the batter, giving it this amazing taste.",

I went all out and ordered the B.A.M.F. which consisted of Fried Chicken, Angry Mac & Cheese, Cheddar, Pepperoncini, and Angry Cheese Sauce all on a delicious waffle. I also had a side of tater tots and coleslaw which wasn't really necessary but nonetheless delicious.   For sure recommend this place. I'd like to try out several other things on their menu. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll probably be stopping in here for a quick meal.",

I ordered the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich and a strawberry lemonade to drink. If you sign up for their rewards you can get a free drink, so my lemonade was free! I loved that there was a syrup dispenser along with the ketchup dispenser! They also had a self-serve water jug.  The sandwich was just what I needed.... juicy dark meat chicken, perfectly fried and crisp on the outside. It also came with chili honey and cider slaw. The slaw was well dressed and came with the perfect amount, but I wish the chili honey had more chili in it! I added a bit of cholula hot sauce throughout the sandwich which made it perfect. I also wished the waffle wasn't as crispy and maybe thicker or fluffy.",

    "text": "We were staying in the Las Vegas strip for 8 days and stumbled across this amazing find, it was so good that we ate lunch here twice while in town. The specialty here is chicken and waffles sandwiches. The waffles they use are nice and thin and crispy, and the chicken is fried to perfection. We split the crispy chicken sandwich is battered and fried twice. It's moist with a perfectly fried outside with a little hint of heat. We also got fries and a drink with our sandwich. All the soda is made in house with real sugar and it's absolutely delicious. We also split a side of bacon Mac and cheese which was deliciously cheesy. For dessert we shared a Nutella and banana dessert waffle which was a perfect sweet treat and dusted with powdered sugar. The staff here is also super friendly and helpful. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you table and will check on you. If you are on the strip and wish to have chicken and waffles you must check this place out. If you're not into chicken and waffles they have other sandwiches served on waffles like a turkey club or even just chicken tenders. This place opens at 9am and serve till midnight or later.",

Tried the fried chicken, pulled pork, sundae, and some other sweet object I can't quite remember, and it was fantastic.

Went on a Friday morning and waited about 15 minutes. Ordered the original chicken and waffles, green eggs and ham and the chicken fried poutine waffle fries! For all three the total came out to be $28 dollars. For myself and my two brothers we had a hard time finishing it all and they're big boys. I recommend trying the original chicken and waffle sandwich! The waffle was spectacular especially when fresh, so crispy!!!! On the green eggs and ham there was wayyyyy too much pesto and had to scrape it off but it was a good try! For the poutine fries,I felt that there was not a good chicken ratio to the fries, like having too much rice with meat it's just bleh. But overall the cheese curds were pretty good and the gravy itself! Waffle fries = plus one! Their dessert waffles looked amazing too but decided not to get it.",

    "text": "It's been years since my fist several visits to the original location in Orange County since it is quite a drive from me (just under 100 miles). My finacee and I were hungry after walking around the strip and I was happy to find out that they had a location in Las Vegas. There was line that was out the door when we arrived, but it moved quickly and our orders were taken and we were sat before we knew it. Now, since the only other Bruxie I've been to was the original location, I wasn't used to the servers having to get your drinks for refills. I understand why because of the way the setup is for this particular location, just wondering if the other locations in CA do this as well? We ordered \"The Original\" and added an egg to it, the \"Nashville Hot\", a Strawberry Palmer, and a ginger soda. I'm glad to say that the food was just as tasty and just as enjoyable as the original location. My finacee enjoyed the Original very much. The chicken filet still had that nice crunch to it and the nice flavor of the herbs and spices. My Nashville Hot had a nice kick to it, but I don't think people from Nashville would call this \"hot\" at all. I enjoyed it because I was able to still taste the chicken, the kick of the spice, and the rest of the seasoning, without overpowering my palate. The Strawberry Palmer was flavorful enough to get the strawberry flavor without being overly sweet. The Ginger soda was a bit strong on the ginger flavor. Also, unfortunately the waffle fries were a bit tough and luke warm. I prefer my fries, crisp and hot. Those were the only small bumps on the road and still an overall great experience for the both of us.",

I was surprised how much I enjoyed everything we ordered.  We wanted to try a couple things so we got The Original Chicken and Waffle sandwich - it was excellent and I loved the fact I could actually hold the entire sandwich in my hand and eat it.  It made the experience and flavor much better to me than the huge plates at some of the other chicken and waffle spots.  We also ordered the Chicken Tenders plate and Waffle Fries.  Also incredible~ . This is a new favorite spot.  And the price is very reasonable.  So, if you are in the mood for some delicious comfort food - Bruxie is it!!!",

Never had a waffle sandwich before, so I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It came on a tray, with the sandwich propped up on a piece of cardboard. It came with a pickle and some extra sauce. Wasn't sure how to eat it - hold it like a sandwich or knife/fork? When I picked it up, unfortunately all the pork fell out because the fold in the waffle was all soggy. Not appetizing. It was like the waffle wasn't cooked long enough to develop that light crunch on the outside. My friend's waffle sandwich fared a little better but I could see it was also not crisp enough.  If they cooked the waffle a little longer, it would have been perfect.",

The chicken was crispy and had a maple glaze on it. The waffle had melting butter and the two combined very well, I was afraid it might be too dry but it was extremely juicy. My wife and friends got the sandwiches which is their specialty and they enjoyed them. I didn't get one because I don't like eggs. The employees were very nice and answered all our questions and cleaned our plates as we finished but we didn't feel rushed out.",

Took about 15 min to come out but man it was worth the small wait! The chicken was so crispy and piping hot. The butter was melting into the waffle. I drizzled syrup on the waffle and started cutting into bite size pieces. My kids loved the chicken, they said the waffle was just ok but I thought the waffle was outstanding! My order was way more than enough to share and we all left full and happy! Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.",

I had the original because how else can you compare anything if you didn't have the original. I went around noon because I didn't have breakfast that day. The line was short and you order and pay at the register. You hold onto a buzzer and they bring out the food when ready. You grab the utensils you need, extra syrup if you want and water is dispensed near there as well. I don't think they have people cleaning after you all the time, so the table we sat at was dirty from the customers before us. It's a big portion but I think it's doable to finish the meal by yourself. There wasn't really anything special about the chicken or the waffle. I felt like the waffle was similar to an Eggo waffle and the chicken was small. The cole slaw wasn't anything special and there's a lot of hype to this place but maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I wouldn't recommend ordering the original because I have had better plain chicken and waffles.",

Before lining up we noticed something new and decided to check out Bruxie.  While everyone in our group ordered chicken and waffles, for some reason I thought to myself that a salad would be good. I know, I know, who in their mind would go to Bruxie and think...gee I've eaten so much fatty food while in Vegas, maybe I'll just get a salad :/ Surprisingly enough, the Roasted Mushroom & Grilled Chicken salad was more than I could have ever hoped for. The tasty chicken was balanced balanced out with Crimini Mushrooms, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Herb Goat Cheese, Romaine & Arugula, Lemon Vinaigrette and a Balsamic Reduction. The portion itself was huge and probably should have fed at least 2 people but I was hungry and ate it all.  The girl at the counter was friendly, there was ample seating at 9pm on a Friday, and our food was brought out to our table with a smile. I'll be back Bruxie!",

They kept the door propped open during the lunch hour and we all wanted to wear our coats. Plus the music was way too loud.  It didn't improve that much with the food. The husband and I got the classic fried chicken waffle sando. If I was blindfolded I would have just guessed I was eating sauce on crispy bread. Any subtlety of flavor was lost with the sweet chile sauce which overwhelmed everything. I had hoped the slaw could have cut the spicy sweetness (and for the record I can handle spiciness) but there wasn't enough of it. I did request pickles which helped a little.

I ordered the Green Eggs and Ham waffle and my husband ordered The Original (chicken and waffles, with chilli honey).  OMG!  It was delish!  The waffle is fluffy but not overwhelming, and the eggs and pesto were a great match!  My husband really enjoyed The Original and said it was one of the best he's had.  The chilli honey was a nice addition!  I had iced tea, which was not only refreshing, but you can actually taste it.  My husband had an iced coffee with had a surprising kick and it was refreshing as well.  We wanted a sweet treat, but the waffles were enough to satisfy our hanger pangs (yes, we were almost hangry -angry hungry).  I got a refill of their delicious tea, which they graciously offer.  The service was fast and friendly, but the place tends to be loud and busy (although we walked by at around 2ish and it was not as busy).

There was a ton of food cooked and ready to be served but despite several (6? 8?) food runners and managers, they just couldn't get it together. Hence four vs. five stars.   That being said, it would get five stars if they got their act together in the service front. The waffles were crispy and buttery tasting without being too greasy, and the flavor combinations were creative and delicious. We ordered the sausage and egg waffle, the pesto and egg waffle, and the lemon berry waffle (side notes: the pesto is what elevated the already good flavor of that waffle sandwich, and the lemon berry waffle needs more berries). All were incredible and we would go back here in a heartbeat if we came back to Vegas.",

    "text": "LIBERO IN LAS VEGAS: In town for a volleyball (vball) tournament and Las Vegas is a destination for many things, including an interesting dining experience. Back in November we tried chicken and waffles (C&W; someone in our trio's first time) and I was directed to try Bruxie, a restaurant with locations here as well as in Southern California.  A 'libero' in vball is responsible for defense and to foster rallies and digs to make the game more fun to watch. I give you this definition because Bruxie reminds me of this role. A re-imagined take on what is now an epidemic of C&W spots all claiming to be authentic, Bruxie's twist is presenting the dish as a sandwich with the waffle's role creating the excitement.  Used as the bread, now C&W is a sandwich to be picked up, held and savored. Some have lettuce, arugula pesto, tomato and various preparations of chicken - Nashville hot, original seasoned, crispy and buffalo-style. Lot of choices including dessert waffles, custards  and sundaes so there's something for everyone who wants decadence with skosh of guilt. Don't expect any healthy options here!  The chicken was the star for me. Served hot (although not too busy, it took a little longer than we thought), golden brown w/a kick of heat on the backside and extremely flavorful with an crunchy crust drizzled in chili honey my two piece original was moist white meat which I'd recommend. Now I understand what the few extra minutes were for - fresh preparation.  For me though, the waffle wasn't as successful. With the two piece you get a bacon cheddar waffle. Thick in height, light with a savory batter the waffle missed in one way - the bit of bacon seemed caramelized and we crunchy like candy. if intentional, this wasn't a pleasant bite for me as the bacon flavor was non-existent. Crunch, no munch.  Overall though, a great chicken outweighs the waffle and holds the team together and you should put Bruxie in your lineup.",

Highly recommend if you just wanna get something real quick",

There are two different types of waffles that get served here. The fluffy style, Belgian I presume, and the crispy style, like an Eggo? that they use for their sandwiches. The whole premise is the Bruxie, which is like a sandwich, so the waffle is made to support the contents, but they are so big you can't pick them up like a sandwich. My preference would have been the fluffy waffle, and to eat it with a fork. But the taste was great all around. The custard shake was epic. A perfect treat for a hot day, I got the salted caramel one and loved everything about it.",

A solid 5 is worthy of a score as it hit all the elements of a great yelp restaurant: fair prices, clean restaurant, delivery to table short, and of course the most important the food here is delicious. The chicken has enough flavor, seasoning/spices and never dry only juicy tenders of meat. Not to mention the umami taste of the waffles was up to par as well. Definitely will pay this place a visit again if in the Vegas metro area!",

My friend got the holy chicken waffle sandwich and that one is a beast. More like a heart attack. It has bacon, sunny side up egg, and Sriracha sauce. Whoa.

Scattered on a bed of fresh cut romaine is juicy chunks of chicken breasts tossed with very aromatic sun dried tomato (gives the salad a nice sweet and tart flavor, very summery) and yummy cut crimini mushroom. The portion of the salad is generous and it will leave you full. It's one of my go-tos on the menu every time I'm at Bruxies. :)  They have a large area for seating so finding somewhere to sit wasn't hard and it seems less busy than Shake Shack, good for us.

Although I came in the winter cold, I suspect in the summer this place will be even more amazing once they open the garage-door style windows.  Food is wonderful, and on par with the LA location at which I've eaten.  I split the following:  Lemon Creme and Berries (Dessert) Waffle -- this is great, but tart so prepare yourself for that. It's an adorable waffle sandwich filled with lemon creme and... raspberries(!).    Original Seasoned Crispy Chicken Tenders (comes with Waffle Fries) -- A classic fried chicken tender.  We asked for a side of the chili honey sauce to pour over as if our chicken was the original with bones... but had instead opted for the one that would be easier to eat.  The skin is crispy, the chicken juice, and finger-licking good.  Strawberry Lemonade -- Sugary, oh my.  But great to drink with the rest of the salty and sweet food we'd ordered. Also FREE REFILLS. Insert love eye emoji here.  An easy stop located on the outside of NYNY (more North from the standard entrance). Go on, you know you want to go.",

We sat outside and with the fan and the shade it was cool, even on a hundred degree Vegas day. Definitely will return if I get a chance.

We each got three piece chicken meals with what they sell as a \"waffle\". Having eaten c+w all over this country I figured I had a good idea what Im eating when i order c+w....   Wrong.   This place doesnt even serve real waffles. They serve a rock hard and dense brick of biscuit dough that has been subjected to abuse in a waffle press.   Fake ass waffle and SERIOUSLY OVER SALTED batter for the fried chicken. To salvage the meal i had to pick the breading off (no saving the disgusting waffles, they went into the trash).   God help you if you are dumb enough to think this food is worth paying for.",

Don't forget the waffle sauce, but it can get stickyyyy aaaayeeee. Only downside is that if you go during the day it's hot and you're gonna get a swampy booty. All good.. Worth it for the food.",

We came here twice in one day and it was great. We had ordered a side of the Angry Mac & Cheese, a side of Fried Pickles, a Southern BBQ Waffle Sandwich, a side of the Bacon-Cheddar Waffle, and an order of the Irish Nachos. I loved it all! Like honestly, I don't think there was a bad bite. Everything was also tasty as leftovers. I especially went crazy over the angry mac & cheese and the Irish Nacho. Waffle fries, Bruxie Cheese Sauce, applewood smoked bacon, sour cream, and chives... it's a no brainer. Get in me!  If I have to say one bad thing, I think there were too many pearl sugars in my bacon-cheddar waffle because it became unbearably sweet after a few bites. No need for syrup. I just used the maple butter they supplied on top while trying to remove all the globs of pearl sugars I saw in the waffle. Decadence!",

It's a short walk from the arena, close to California Pizza Kitchen and a variety of restaurants in the area.  Parking is horrid (as you can imagine) on the strip.  We just Uber'd it to the arena.  Nice that it's open late (til midnight), as our concert let out at 11pm.    Ordering is done at the counter entrance and you get a beeper to take to your table.   Food was delivered to us pretty quickly especially as they were pretty busy.   The 3 of us ordered the original chicken waffle sandwich, chicken tenders, and the goat cheese/mushroom waffle sandwich.  Food was really good except the goat cheese/mushroom wasn't my favorite.  I still gave it 4stars for the other food.  Stick with the fried chicken and you can't go wrong!",

The chicken was seasoned very well and it was perfectly cooked. It was not greasy at all. The waffle was crisp and fluffy at the same time. The small bottle of maple syrup that came it is such a charming touch. It stole my heart. It was the perfect amount for the waffle. I also had the strawberry lemonade it was delicious. Perfect contrast of sweet and sour. My daughter ordered a milkshake it was so creamy and delicious. She also ordered the Irish nachos with were really good too. The staff was really friendly.  Great atmosphere.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was pretty warm inside and I had to clean my own table. I will definitely be back.",

I actually like sticking to The Original (basically a fried chicken sandwich using a waffle instead of bread) and then getting some fries. This time we also tried the kickin' strips (not spicy, but had good flavor) and the angry mac n cheese (which wasn't really cheesy, but I still enjoyed the flavor).   Overall a good place if you're in the mood for fried chicken, but it's not necessarily going to wow you.  Stay Cheerful ;)",

To begin, I was thoroughly disappointed in the cleanlines of the ketchup, water, syrup station and friendliness of their staff members upon arrival.  After receiving my meal, I went to the front for the ketchup and they were out at both stations.   When,  I asked if ketchup stations could be refilled I was told to hold on, however I waited for over 10 minutes for that to take place.  However once I received my Ketchup from the waiter she threw it on the table at me in an fit.  Our drinks never arrived with our meal so we had to get them ourselves.   Next, for the price of the food  we could have stayed home.  This place truly does not exemplify the standard of chicken and waffles.  Therefore,  my review of this establishment is a no bueno!!",

    "text": "Three stars because, to be fair, fried food isn't exactly my first choice of cuisine but I do have to credit it for delicious finger-licking comfort food after a long night of clubbing in Vegas.  Very casual ambiance where people order at the front and then find seats in the back- luckily we were able to beat the lunch crowd 11am on Sunday and so we could get a seat inside.    I went with the Original Fried Chicken and Waffle (my friends ordered another original sandwich and the Original Seasoned Fried Chicken and Waffle Skillet) and we decided to order Fried Chicken Poutine to share.  The sandwich is rather filling already, especially for one who tends to avoid food with a lot of grease.  I usually don't like spicy foods, but the chicken and waffle had a great sweet-and-spicy balance.  Chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside (thank god) and the waffle was nice and crunchy!  The only complaint I had was that I literally took one bite of the sandwich and the waffle broke apart immediately and splattered sauce all over me... definitely a 5-napkin meal in my case.  First time trying poutine- absolutely delicious though it kinda was an overkill on top of everything else we ordered (three girls had a hard time finishing half of it)!  I know poutine is supposed to be very rich, and it was very hearty- just be prepared to completely pass out afterwards!    If you are someone who loves fried food, has a hangover, or is completely willing to enter a food coma for the whole day, this is a good place to check out- not sure if it's necessarily the place for someone who is completely sober and prefers lighter meals.",

I went with 4 girlfriends on a trip to Vegas and wanted to grab a quick bite before a pool party. This was exactly what we were looking for. You order at the counter, get a number and a waiter brings you your food. Quick and efficient. Light and fluffy waffles with a slight crisp to the outer layer acted as the bread for perfectly fried, juicy chicken breasts that weren't too oily. We each tried a different sandwich and ALL of them were amazing. The fries were decent and the drinks refreshing. My gf's and I joked that we should look into opening one in NY. My inner fatgirl would be an issue though.",

I tried the strawberry lemonade. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. Not powerfully strawberry-ish, though.  Only 50cents to add cheese sauce to their side and drink combo. This place isn't price gouging at all and I respect that a lot in sin city.  Chicken waffle sandwich was intriguing. The chicken \"breast\" appeared to be a conglomerate of mixed chicken breast pieces, tenderized and breaded in a patty shape, rather than a single breast. It was nice quality meat mostly so I didn't mind. Just wasn't expecting it. Asked for my slaw on the side and it was probably less than 1 big forkful. Not upset I'm not that into slaw.  Waffle fries with cheese sauce on the side was good.  The waffle it's self was okay. Light airy and crispy. I was expecting a bit more tenderness, TBH.  The food I would rate 3 stars. Good not great. A nice easy lunch. The customer service pushed it up to 4 stars. The kid running around helping people and clearing tables was super zippy and cheerful.",

Fortunately, there were only a couple people in front of us so we got to order quickly. The first thing I noticed was the very reasonable pricing. I ended up getting two of the liege waffles ($3.95 for the regular and $4.95 for the chocolate filled- though the regular comes with chocolate to dip so maybe skip the chocolate filled?) with a coffee ($2.50) and my friends all got waffle sandwiches.   We sat down with our buzzers and the food was brought to us quickly. Service was great, food/coffee was GREAT, and I never felt crammed even though it isn't a huge space. Definitely a must-eat breakfast (or lunch or dinner) on the strip!!",

The chicken waffle combos are seasoned and tasty! Food arrived quickly as well. The second time I went I got the turkey avocado sandwich and it was simply the tasty and cooked to perfection.

They will give you a number and will bring out the food afterwards. I was a little overwhelmed by what waffles I wanted to be honest because I couldn't pick between savory or sweets. In the end, I went with savory.  I ordered the Nashville Hot while my boyfriend ordered the Holy. I preferred mine over his since I like my food spicier and no cheese. It was a good amount of food and I was getting full after the first half of the waffle. The chicken was so soft and juicy. I can see why there are so many reviews to this place!   Definitely check out this place if you're in the area!",

The bacon cheddar waffle with fried chicken (got Nashville hot) was enormous and the waffle very unique-caramelized with cheese pockets yet retained fluffiness.   The chicken was seasoned perfectly-well spiced and not salty or too oily. There is self-serve maple syrup and generous portions of butter served on the side.   The Belgium mocha was also very richly chocolate and creamy, I was surprised at the quality!    I would love to try one of the waffle sandwiches next time which were also massive and full of interesting toppings. Food is brought to your table with a buzzer and service was quick and organized. The only thing I didn't like were the waffle fries as I assumed they'd be soft but they were really crispy- some people might like that.",

Waffle fries were standard waffle fries, in my opinion but I absolutely loved the waffle sandwich. We got here at 9am when it opened for breakfast and there was already a line out the door. Definitely recommend to come earlier to avoid standing in a longer line. I was very surprised by how crowded it got at 10am. However, it could be worth the wait!",

The drinks were terrible (seriously, do not order their ginger based cocktail. It was harsh!).   The chicken was fantastic and the waffles tasty and freshly made. The only downside was that most of the other food was unexceptional (namely the fries). Stick just to the waffle and chicken and it will be a blissful experience.",

For a second night in a row, my husband suggested eating fried chicken since he had previously seen a billboard at Bruxie early in our stay.    We have eaten at Bruxie's 2nd location at Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade and was happy to see a familiar California transplant here at The Park.  At this location, ordering typically easy as you walk in, you'll see the menu boards above the order counter.  First, order your food and beverage at the counter.  Next, you'll be given a small placard with a number that identifies your order.  Meanwhile, find seating that will accommodate your group and finally, a server will bring your food to you.  At this location, the service was friendly and efficient.  The food was tasty and served fresh and hot from the kitchen.  The fried chicken in our sandwiches had a crisp breading and the chicken breast meat was actually quite tasty and moist.  Waffles are used as the bun to the sandwiches.  The fresh baked waffles are light and crisp and hold their texture without getting soggy.  We enjoyed the food and flavors at this site.  The only surprises that we had were the higher prices of our draft beer ($8) and sandwiches.  Ah, but, this IS Las Vegas.",

It was more of a savory waffle than a sweet waffle. Though they did put some maple syrup in it.  I also got a spiked milkshake. It cost an extra $5 to get it spiked. It was bomb! So worth it! It doesn't matter where you are on the strip. Go to Bruxie for an awesome meal! It is not that expensive either. The waffle sandwiches are pretty big and cost $12.

Recently, I've seen so many white bread versions trying to copy Roscoe's. I even had one place serve me fried chicken with Eggo waffles lol. There was a Bruxie, (a SoCal-based eatery) across the street from SDSU in the College area of San Diego for years, but it went under last year. So when we took a weekend vaca to Las Vegas shortly thereafter, I was pumped when I saw they had a new location on the Strip, right across from the Monte Carlo and T-Mobile Center.  The food is BOMB. I had the buffalo chicken waffle sandwich with the buffalo cheese waffle fries and a pink lemonade; all in all ran me about $13. The wife had a buffalo chicken salad which was huge and delish ($9). My brother and his friend both ordered the Nashville hot strips and waffles with a spicy syrup. Pure culinary murder. The strips were tender, big, and juicy. For the portions, location, cleanliness, and price, you'd be very hard pressed to find better on the Strip.",

I heard such good reviews from my friends in Cali but I never actually went so I was glad when they opened up a place here in Vegas! I just hate that it's on the strip lol.   I've tried a couple of things on their menu - the original waffle sandwich, the waffle sandwich with the Nashville hot chicken, and the Irish nachos (?). I gotta say I LOVE the Irish nachos; I think it's my favorite thing on the menu. It's waffle fries with some cheese sauce & bacon & just ooey gooey goodness! Between the two sandwiches that I tried, I would have to go with the Nashville one Cos I love spicy food! It has a really nice kick to it, but definitely not burn your mouth kick. Definitely try the Irish nachos tho (I really hope that's what it's called lol).",

We were expecting it to be quite heavy, but were pleasantly surprised by how light the dessert crepes were. My brother and dad liked the creme brulee waffles the best.  Overall, the texture and flavor of the waffles were perfect and we would definitely come back. I can't wait to try a savory crepe next!",

I ordered the chicken tenders that were very juicy. The waffle fries that came with my chicken tenders were dry. Pure cane sugar sodas made there were very sweet, and you get free refills. The prices are unfortunately strip expensive and I don't believe worth almost $10 for a sandwich that does not come with french fries, Or for chicken tenders with dry waffle fries. No other customers in the store, but never had a manager or other server come to the table to ask how everything was or see if a sofa refill was needed (like they did on my last visit)",

    "text": "Bruxie has some seriously delicious chicken! The waffles are pretty good too.  We stopped in at probably the worst time, shortly after the naming ceremony for the new hockey team. Holy cow, they had obviously been hit hard by the crowds and the restaurant looked like it! Totally understandable for the amount of people that were drawn in by the special event. It was obvious that the staff was trying to play catch up with busing tables and getting orders out to everyone. Since it was a special circumstance I can't really speak to what the normal cleanliness would be in the restaurant or how long it would normally take to receive an order.  I ordered the Nashville-Style Hot Chicken that is served with a Cheddar Bacon Waffle Biscuit topped with Maple Butter. Wow, so much flavor in this dish. The Nashville-Style Hot Chicken was hot as promised and will satisfy a craving for spicy food for sure. The waffle helped balance out the heat. I loved the flavor of the cheddar bacon waffle with the maple butter on top. So yummy. The only part I didn't love was the crunchy sugar crystal pieces that were fine at first, but started to overwhelm the flavor towards the end.   My husband ordered an Original Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. This was also very tasty. The sandwiches are larger than the dish I ordered so I'd suggest this for larger appetites.   For dessert we shared a Liege Waffle with Caramelized Pearl Sugar. I think next time I would try another dessert option. The waffle was pretty good, but it was not what I expect in flavor and texture from a liege waffle. The pearl sugar crystals were large and the texture became off-putting for me as I ate more of the waffle.  Overall, the chicken is amazing and the waffles are a close second. A delicious meal for sure if you are near the NYNY or Monte Carlo.",

I wasn't disappointed, the chicken and waffles sandwich was delicious! The only downside was the Mac and cheese, it was bland, but the sandwich more then made up for it. The staff was friendly and attentive, noticing I didn't have utensils and bring me over some even though it was self service.",

Be it dripping with warm maple syrup, topped with fruits, preserves, jams, and whipped cream, or as a bun for a perfectly seasoned boneless chicken breast, spicy BBQ Chicken, California club, pulled pork roasted turkey, pastrami and Swiss, roasted mushrooms and goat cheese.... wait, what were we talking about?  Bruxie, the Cali born waffle joint has made it to Vegas.  And yes, it is as good as expected.  Outstanding, with no sweetness.  Nothing get's in the way of making a great waffle.  The Naked with cinnamon sugar or maple syrup the perfect way to whet the palate.  In general, the consistency of the waffles hold up well to the \"wet\" fillings with their outer layer maintaining the crispness.    For breakfast, the prosciutto and Swiss, oozing with melted Swiss cheese and a fried egg, all kinds of good eats. A generous smear of whole grain mustard cuts the richness of the yolk perfectly.  Sub sage spiced breakfast sausage and cheddar and you get a solid country sausage and egg breakfast sandwich, equally tasty.  Of course, chicken and waffles.  Take an aggressively seasoned, not too heavily coated,  deep fried, crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside boneless chicken breast, give it some sweet heat (chili honey) and top it with some cider slaw.  Calories and fat aside, oh yeah!  For something that will make your head tilt like a confused dog, try the roasted mushroom and goat cheese.  Sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, arugula, lemon vinaigrette and a balsamic reduction in a waffle?  It works and well.  Friendly service.  Prices are what they are.  Expect to pay $10 for any \"sandwich\".  A great fast food option for the frenetic Strip.",

I ordered the smores waffle for the kids, and they didn't even care too much for it. There was this lemon custard waffle dessert like dish with fruits...

The other stuff is good, but I don't see a reason to order them.   The sandwich waffle IS NOT the bacon waffle you get in the skillet. The bacon waffle is a different, tastier beast.  The Bacon Waffle is the best waffle I've had with or without chicken. The bacon fat doesn't hit you over the head with smoke or salt, the pork fat mixes in well with the sugar and rosemary. The outside is crisp and has a crunch from the crystalized sugar, the inside is flaky and soft.  The Chicken has a kick. Crisp and Juicy. Get a side of honey for a dip.",

I asked her if we can split the bill and she gave me an attitude right away. She should not be giving customers nasty looks and shaking her head while taking orders!!!  I ordered the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork waffle sandwich & a strawberry lemonade, and my friend ordered the Bruxie Burger & the regular waffle fries (which we shared). We thought the portions looked small at first especially since the prices are not very cheap, but we were mistaken. We felt so full near the end of our meal. My pulled pork sandwich was okay; it was a little messy to eat since it started falling apart as soon as I took my first bite. I was not a fan of the strawberry lemonade. It tasted very bland like mushed strawberries and water.   I am giving this place three stars because of our rude server, mediocre food, and slightly high prices. The prices would be better if the sandwiches included fries. $2.95 for a separate order of waffle fries (which only included like 6 fries) was definitely not worth it!",

The Nashville was DELICIOUS! I was not disappointed. It was a light flakey waffle topped with lettuce sauce and of course chucken. It was a bit spicy. Loved it! My ceaser salad was just ok. A bit too much dressing. Lemonade was good.   I would come back in a heartbeat. Cant wait to visit vegas again just to eat here! I love the big fans on the ceiling.",

Original Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich (4.5 stars) - Very tasty seasoned fried chicken with a dash of chili honey and slaw in a waffle to be eaten like a sandwich. Cool and so delicious. Only downer was that waffle was a bit cold, wish it was warm like the rest of the sandwich.  Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich (4 stars) - Carolina BBQ sauce was really good with a slight kick. Pulled pork itself was a bit mushy. But the BBQ sauce with the meat and the waffle worked nicely together. Again the waffle itself was a bit cold.  Atmosphere is modern and atmosphere was lively, a bit hectic on opening week. Managers and servers are super attentive and friendly to make sure you have a great first experience.  It's part of the new Park area in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. Part of a bunch of new hip  places to try around there.   Bottom line: A new Vegas must try, definitely hit the Fried Chix and waffle at least once. Was too full to try the frozen custard, coming back for that next time...",

I love me some chicken and waffles and Bruxie did not disappoint!! Fried chicken, crispy bacon and a runny egg?? It doesn't get more perfect than that! It was served with warm maple syrup and everything was so tasty. I saw people eating these \"sandwiches\" with their hands but this was definitely a \"fork and knife\" situation for me. The waffle was thinner than a normal belgium waffle but the carb to protein ratio works. The chicken is crispy and perfectly cooked through and seasoned. If you are in the area, you need to try this chicken and waffles place because it is the best!",

I don't like syrup on my chicken, next time I know to ask for it on the side. My husband got chicken and waffles and son got waffles with a side of scrambled eggs. Both enjoyed their meals, especially the fried chicken. Also got the Belgian mocha which I didn't really care for, my son's got chocolate was better.",

I fondly recall the first Bruxie I had at the original location here in Orange County like yesterday and like some kind of new school In N Out they have stayed the course ever since.  The ingredients are all from well known and quality purveyors such as Tillamook, Chenel and Boar's Head. The soda is all made from pure sugar cane and the floats are hand mixed. Look to the Smoked Salmon Lox & Dill Cream Cheese and Hot Pastrami Bruxie sandwiches for a guaranteed win. The Root beer soda and Creamsicle Float also will not disappoint.   The lines can become outrageous at times, but that is expected with food of this quality at this price point located on the center of The Strip. The employees do a great job of mitigating frustration and keeping the lines moving. That is when they are not bending over backward to get ketchup or a drink refill for sitting customers.  Honestly, I think Yelpers at large take the fast and fast-casual categories way too seriously and therefore the baby gets thrown out with the bathwater in reviews. If you  do not find any value in their sub-$8.00 offerings Shake Shack literally next door.   A solid option for lunch.",

I should preface that I'm not an enjoyer of chicken but Bruxie's crack chicken is an exception. We had the strips and spicy tots and the sandwich on the bun with the slaw (don't remember the name) and both were tasty as always. I don't think I'll ever visit Vegas and not stop for a lunch bite at Bruxie, it's just something about the crispness and flavor of the chicken that make life complete.

The waffles were not overly sweet and were also very airy--not at all heavy like a regular waffle!   We ordered the bacon, egg, and cheddar and the green eggs & ham sandwiches, both of which were absolutely delicious! The spicy tots were a super fun alternative to traditional hash browns, and the orange cream alcoholic shake was such a delicious indulgence at an early hour.   I foresee myself coming here again and again when in Vegas! Thanks Bruxie!!",

    "text": "So it's has been awhile since my fiance and I have been to Bruxies. Since we were both craving chicken and some Irish nachos, we both decided to take a trip to the one in the strip. We originally tasted the one in Irvine, Ca. where they did not disappoint.  Located right in the area between Park MGM and T-Mobile Arena, we decided to give this place a try. Pricing was a bit on the pricey side from what we both recall as we were looking over the menu. So I decided to try the Buffaload w/ fries and my fiance got the El jefe with the Irish Nachos. Knowing that our tab came out to about $45 bucks we could not wait to eat.   So the stars keep rolling down due the experience. One star taken away because it was overly pricey for the taste. Or as they say you get what you pay for. As soon as our food came, Irish nachos was measly and did not barely have any bacon, sauce, or not even a handful of toppings to enjoy it. They bring the Buffaload along with my fries, cool it looked pretty appetizing at first. The size was big, however do not let the size fool you. The buffalo sauce they used was not even hot enough and it was already cold biting into five minutes later. It was so bad, I did not even finish it and gave it to my fiance. As for the El Jefe, and the girl at the register told my fiance it was supposed to taste like seasoned carnitas. No where near close to that taste.   Overall, for the price and for the taste, I would go somewhere else where it's not overly priced and get the quality you love. On to the next.",

    "text": "My Vegas vacation ended with breakfast at Bruxie, and what a delicious way to go!  I got the fried chicken skillet, that came with a savory waffle and sausage gravy.  I think it could've been hotter, temperature wise, because the middle of the waffle was kind of cold, but the flavors were all there.  And the egg on top was the piece de resistance.  Everything on that skillet worked, from the crispy fried chicken, to the soft waffle, and bit of sausage in the gravy.    Seating was a bit hard to find.  It's communal seating, so after snagging a spot, we had to wait for someone to wipe the table from the previous diners.  Also, the floors were sticky, so they need to work on finding a way to clean the dining area as often as possible.  Prices were standard for a place on the strip, but I think it was worth it.  The other option was a sad croissant sandwich from a place in NY NY.. it was cheaper, but not worth it IMO.  Next time I would get my food to go.  There are a few tables outside near the entrance of the hotel, but I can't imagine sitting there during those hot Vegas summers.  I'd probably eat my meal back at the hotel.",

While on the search for something we don't comparatively have at home, we stumbled upon Bruxie. Located near New York New York Hotel and a host of other restaurants lining up the strip.   The venue is outfitted with exposed brick in a cafeteria-esque vibe punctuated with food served on metal trays churning up sweet and savory waffles along with soups, salads and other Southern staples.   Chicken and Waffle is a brilliant play on taste and texture. The chicken is well seasoned and tender while the waffle is crispy with a hint of sweetness. A great combination!   We opted for The Nashville- -smoky in flavor with just the right amount of heat while dressed in a tangy sauce, lettuce and pickles to balance out the kick and an over-medium egg to bring it all together. Washed it all down with a refreshing strawberry lemonade!  A meal worth trying if you're in the area!",

My main gripe with chicken & waffles is that it's difficult to eat. The waffle is too unwieldy. The chicken pieces are too big. Bones? All that syrup? Where does it all go? Bruxie solves that. The waffle they use is lighter and thinner, so you get the full waffle experience without the logistical difficulties. The chicken is in manageable pieces.   I got the Original. It was phenomenal. Sweet, spicy, crunchy. The spiced tots were a great addition. They would have been great with ranch, but I was too busy stuffing my face to get up and ask if they had it. My friend got the Irish Nachos, which were delicious, but a little overwhelming. Very heavy. I still think I got the best thing. In fact, I loved that it wasn't too heavy for a chicken & waffle sandwich. No food coma here.  My Original and tots came to $17, which is pretty good for breakfast on the strip. I want more.",

While wandering around Las Vegas around the New York, New York casino, you'll find Bruxie located on the edge of the building. This place pretty much offers all different kinds of chicken and chicken sandwiches and it's quite the place. I came here on Friday night and ordered the \"Holy Chicken\" consisting of Maple Glazed Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Sriracha Sauce, and a Sunny-Side Up Egg. In case you skipped over what was in this sandwich, it was perfection with a side of waffle fries. The food took a little while to make, but then again, perfection does take a little bit of time. Once finished and served this thing was almost overwhelming to look at. The waffle fries were fantastic in every possibly way, making them the perfect companion for the monstrous sandwich. The sandwich is actually hard to describe, and is definitely a little overwhelming on the taste buds. The chicken itself is crunchy but juicy, with oh so good breading. The egg, Sriracha sauce, cheese, bacon, and honey mixed together makes this thing so much more then just a chicken sandwich, this thing is definitely in my top 5 chicken sandwiches of all time, did I mention how good it was?   Bruxie is not a healthy place, but if you feel like living it up in Las Vegas, you should probably give this place a try.",

It was our last day there and we were both pretty tired and feeling hungover, but chicken and waffles sounded like something that would hit the spot and we were not disappointed.  First I love the location, it is right in New York, New York area, which honestly is my favorite.. and it is located to an area where on a nice day you can take it outside and eat at one of the tables. The area to eat is not very big, but it has room if you have a large group. Plus they prepare the food very quickly so people come eat and leave pretty quickly. It is good for family if you have a family to bring.  We decided to order a waffle sandwich that the guy at the front desk recommended and boy oh boy it was sooooooo good. We split one sandwich but honestly I almost had wished just just got my own because it was just that good. The ratio of sweet to savory was perfect, honestly it is some good hangover food.  The sandwiches are a little messy to eat, but I do not think it is worth getting upset about, I mean you are eating a waffle with syrup... and common it is Vegas loosen up . The prices are a little high though, so do not come if you are looking for something on the cheaper side.",

The texture of the waffle is nice because you can eat it like a sandwich and it doesn't fall apart or get messy. Also, refills on the drinks are free and you can interchange your drink for free too.

I was a little hesitant I would be so satisfied considering that my waffle sandwich, Buffalo-style fries, and drink was worth the $19 pricetag, but it surprisingly was.  The Original chicken waffle sandwich is/was a culinary masterpiece. Took 10mins to get to my table, but worth the wait. The waffle was light and crisp. The chicken perfectly fried and lightly battered. The slaw and chili-honey sauce complemented each other nicely. TIP: order an extra side of the sauce for dipping/topping. Also, feel free to change soft drinks without extra charge.  The Buffalo style fries were great. Not too soupy or soggy, with ample blue cheese sprinkles. Just wish there were a few more fries per order.  I'll be back for this meal next time I'm in Vegas.",

Probably the best chicken fingers I have ever had! The ranch (that I usually hate) was fantastic and my husband who doesn't like BBQ sauce loved theirs! The chicken was actual tender meat that looked hand battered. They had light spice to them but nothing over powering. The fries were just basic waffle fries nothing spectacular. The strawberry lemonade was tasty too! Not too sweet!   The reason for the 4 stars is the staff! They weren't overly helpful and almost seemed annoyed. It wasn't even busy...which maybe I could have understood. Also $15 for chicken fingers?!?! Yikes! They were good chicken fingers though!",

The location is convenient -- in the Park between NY NY and the Monte Carlo, with a street-facing facade that eliminates the need to hike through a smoky casino.  At 9am, Bruxie is busy but not overloaded.  It takes a few moments to place your order, grab a seat in the spacious and tidy dining room, and wait for your order to be delivered.    I had the original fried chicken and waffle, with a side of fruit.  I was familiar with Bruxie's style of chicken and waffles from an earlier to visit to one of the Orange County locations, and the Las Vegas location is True to the rest of the franchise.  The flavor is outstanding. My only complaint: not enough crispiness, both on the waffle and on the chicken.  In my world, fried chicken is all about that perfect crisp on the outside to contrast against the softness and juiciness on the inside.  Prices are surprisingly good -- consistent with other locations, and not obviously jacked up due to proximity to the Strip.  Odds of me returning are quite high!",

All of it was amazing. The Waffle was light and fluffy. Chicken was crispy and moist. The Mac and cheese had perfect cheese flavor. The Waffle fries amazing as the bacon really added flavor.   All of it was so good but as you get through about half of your meal, it starts to feel too heavy and you just can't continue eating anymore. I still had the room but tapped out. This is expected with how heavy the food is but Bruxie is definitely still significantly lighter if you were to order the same stuff at other places.  I hope to come here as I'm in town again!",

I got the basil/goatcheese/tomato waffle sandwich, and it was great.  The waffle fries are also delicious.  Warning, it is super messy to eat, but 100% worth being a hot mess in Vegas.    There's plenty of seating and the service was decent, but quite slow for the dinner rush. There was only one person working the register, with a line out the door.  Finally they brought someone else in and the line was much smoother from then.  There wasn't wifi, and we walked here so I dont know what the parking situation is, but the food was delicious.  When I found out there were more locations in LA, I was super excited.  Cannot wait for my next Bruxie's dine-out.",

My favorite dish was definitely the fried chicken with waffle, especially the waffle. The bacon cheddar had a glaze on it and usually I don't like sweet and savory together but this was so good. The fried chicken weren't thighs or drumsticks (which I prefer), and sometimes it was a little dry but the outside was super crispy and yummy. For the Irish nachos, it's nice to snack on, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The waffle fries itself was really good!",

Sandwiched inside was a peppered fried chicken breast, two strips of bacon, cheese, some special sauce (I think chipotle or spicy mayo, I have no idea) and an over-easy egg. Sounds like a mess right? I thought so too until I saw the picture on the menu (I took a picture so you can see too). I was full when I was half way through my sandwich, but I knew if I stopped eating, I would regret it. This restaurant is new to me, and Las Vegas' arena Park area. Thank goodness they have locations throughout Southern California.",

Oh the orange drink is extremely good, not sure if it's a soda or what, my daughter got that, she usually doesn't like soda but she loves hers.

I ordered the original chicken and waffle sandwich and requested the sauce on the side so I could try it individually with their signature sauce but also with the syrup. Note: syrup not needed cause their sauce is 100% on point! The chicken was cooked with just the right amount of crispiness and that right amount of good grease you need for this dish. Also the waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just as it should be. To drink I had their cherry cola which selling point here is that everything in their store is an in house production no 'name brands' all their own unique creations.  Everything paired extraordinarily well and the guest service was one of the best I have ever had!  I will most definitely be back at Bruxie's the next time I am in Vegas!",

Waited maybe about 15 minutes to get the food. We were some tables with chairs and bar stools. Must go back for our next Vegas trip",

I've had Bruxie's in Orange County bookmarked for ages but never knew a location opened up right next to Shake Shack in Vegas! I tried the Original with fried chicken, chile honey, and cole slaw. One bite of that crispy waffle and I was hooked. Made to order fried chicken with the right amount of delicate crunch. I normally don't like sweet mixed with savory but the light smattering of chile honey distracted me from any excess sweetness. I love cole slaw on sandwiches!   The sausage & egg waffle sandwich looks underwhelming compared to the Original, but the combo is a breakfast staple.  Nutella & bananas! Sweet cream and sprinkles of powdered sugar  We ordered thinly sliced pastrami & Swiss, waffle on the side to take home. I popped the waffle in the oven, along with the pastrami topped with cheese a few hours later-- soo good!   Separated the lemon cream & raspberries so the waffle wouldn't get soggy. Dip waffle pieces into the tart lemon cream and add a berry-- refreshing and the berries aren't sour!   Order at the counter, receive a pager, and choose a table. Staff will bring your order out. Water, utensils, maple syrup and condiments are available at the counter next to the registers.   Can't wait to visit again!",

The chicken like I said is HOT and the chicken moist inside, crispy on the out, their bbq sauce is spicy good. Oh and of course I get the ginger beer. One of these days I will try one of the sandwiches, I just love the chicken, dill pickles and ginger beer. I don't even bother with Shake Shack, even though their burgers are amazing. If you are at the Park between the Park MGM and New York New York and in front of T-Mobile and don't try at least try a home made soda, (I suggest GINGER BEER! Lol) you have no one to whine to about boring food for lunch, SILLY you! If you visit you need to check it out, you are welcome! Lol!

Order your food at the counter and have a seat on a table of your choice.    Food:  The Original Fried Chicken & Waffles: Seasoned Breast, Chili Honey, Cider Slaw Nashville Style Hot: Spicy & Smoky Fried Chicken Thigh, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Lettuce, Pickles  Oh my gosh, the waffle was perfect and my favorite was the original.  The chili honey and slaw was such a great combination.    I will definitely stop by whenever there's a BRUXIE in town.",

It had melted cheese on it which really added a salty, savory flavor. The angry Mac and cheese was a little spicy and cheesy. It had spicy bacon in it too! The golden mule was a great breakfast drink to have with this!! When we got there the line was really long and the place was PACKED. I was worried because we were so hungry, but they were so efficient with taking orders we only stood in line for a few minutes! We also were able to sit at the bar on the side and only waited about 5 minutes before they delivered our food! All the people working there were really helpful and friendly!!",

My boyfriend and I decided to be adventurous and try out their limited time only Korean style burger that was supposed to be a bit spicy. We ended up getting a side of fries and a cream soda as well that apparently they make in house.  It didn't take too long for our order to come out and when it did, it looked really good. They were nice enough to cut the sandwich in half, but the slaw in it kept falling out. It was really salty cause of the soy sauce and it drowned out the flavors a lot from the sandwich in whole. But the chicken was nice and crispy and the waffles were soft and fluffy with some crunch too on the outside. The fries were of course good cause it's hard to do them wrong the sods was pretty good too.  I should've stuck with my gut instinct to just get their signature chicken and waffle sandwich. But glad I gave it a shot though.",

The crust was thick and crunchy, but no complaints here. I prefer a Belgium waffle. Theirs was a little harder and thinner than I like, but still tasty. Mine in particular was undercooked in some places. So was my chicken, which is why this is a 4 out of 5. On another positive note, the mango/strawberry (I don't remember) lemonade was fantastic. And they had it sitting out so you can get your own refill. Highly recommended.",

But if you're not from Southern California, Bruxie isn't bad!  My hard-to-please mother really enjoyed it. And if my mother thought Bruxie is delicious, 5 stars for everyone.  Let me put it out there, it's not cheap. It's not In-n-out or Chick-fi-la. It's like $13 for a burger without a drink or fries, but that's kinda normal in Vegas. We got the Original, which is a chicken sandwich. The combination of light airy waffle, crispy thick chicken patty, cole slaw and maple syrup was very satisfying. Just writing this review, makes my mouth water.  You can't eat this burger/sandwich without getting your hands in syrup. So please wash your hands before and after.  The restaurant is located in New York New York, towards the strip. It's right next Shake Shack which is more visible if you're driving on the strip.",

In fact the food tastes just as great, the service here is amazing, and the location is perfect!     So far my favorite is their Buffalo Chicken waffle with Blue Cheese and Slaw, however on my next visit I am definitely going for the Pastrami Waffle sandwich.  Since I got to taste this sandwich on my last visit I was sold on the perfect taste of Pastrami and their Mustard sauce.I am sure everything served here is delicious and worth trying though.  I have yet to make it to the dessert waffles due to being overly full, but I will soon.  I will say I remember the waffle fries being a little more well done in the LA location, which they tend not to be so much here and also the portion is a little smaller.  They may be fresh waffle fries so like some other fry places, I'll just need to ask for them a little more on the well done side.  I will say that our last visits have been during our hot Summer months and for some reason the doors are always opened and only half of the room have fans, so expect warm eating conditions, this is unfortunately the only part I don't like   The service here is also amazing!  They stop by and check on you often, refilling your drink and removing your empty trays. Definitely a great place for a quick bite.",

    "text": "PROS: Delicious, great value for your money (especially for it's location on the Strip) CONS: Can get busy  During our trip to Vegas a couple weeks ago, my sister-in-law, a Las Vegas local, recommended we try this place for their delicious waffles. She ended up taking my husband and daughter there and both were so pleased with the place that they convinced me to go try it the next day.   We went back on a Friday around 10:00 am and I could tell that the crowd was close on our tails. When we got in line, we were already near the door. (You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you.) Our family of four ordered a Country Sausage & Egg Sandwich, The Original (Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich), a Holy Chicken, a Naked Bruxie Waffle, and a Mint Shake. The sandwiches were much larger and much more filling than I expected. And to top it off, all the food we had was absolutely delicious. The meals even come with a mini bottle of their maple syrup (which I took home with me). The Mint Shake even had REAL mint leaves in it, not just mint flavor added.   As a native of the Bay Area, chicken and waffle joints are commonplace for me. And I've never really cared too much for them. I mean, it's fried chicken. And a waffle. No biggie, right? Then why, after over a week am I still thinking about how Bruxie's waffles have perfectly married the two? Why can I still vividly recall that when I bit into the waffle it delightfully crunched then casually melted in my mouth?  So my sister-in-law had breakfast there today. She sent us photos. And now, I'm looking for an excuse to come back to Vegas to visit family, of course, and to have a waffle while I'm there.",

I believe there where having a minor tech issue with the orders so I just went back to my seat and waited for my order. She not only came back with my order but with a full refund!!! I was perplexed as this is the first time something like this happens to me and it exceeded my expectations.   With this in mind I'm positive that not only they thrive to give the best customer service possible but truly emphasize it. Thanks guys for gifting us an awesome last meal in vegas, we will come back without hesitation next time and obviously recommend it as the food was better than I imagined.",

I was kind of excited to try it...let's say that the children opted to eat it in an deconstructed way...waffle and chicken separately...I myself tried the chicken and found it a little dry for me as it was white meat but the batter was pretty good. The waffle I find a bit thin, I like the waffles thicker.",

I went for a waffle chicken sandwich ( which is what they are known for); since I love barbecue sauce I chose the barbecue chicken sandwich that came with slaw and crispy onions. While all the ingredients were nice and tasty: chicken perfectly cooked, onion rings a very nice touch and great waffle that was perfectly crisp, the barbecue sauce was no good. It tasted like a slightly bitter tomato sauce with nothing else to it; I was highly disappointed and immediately regretted not getting one of the original chicken sandwiches (which was recommended Yelp). It tainted the taste of everything and I feel like this place deserves a five for taste, but I cannot give it that because of the barbecue sauce. I also ordered a side of their waffle fries which were good, I wish I would have ordered them loaded I am sure they would have been fantastic! The business had a simple yet appealing and clean set up. The whole place was very clean,  stocked with outlets for you to charge your phone and the sauce station was nice as well. The service was friendly and surprisingly fast.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone; please don't make the same mistake I did and stay away from the barbecue sauce, so you can truly taste the quality of their food.",

But how awesome that these little known places are starting to creep their way into Vegas!  Unfortunately have only been here twice since it's located on The Strip (where no local really likes to travel to, lol!), but well worth it!  Located in \"The Park\", a great new addition to the Strip, same area as T-Mobile Arena, New York New York, Shake Shack, Beerhaus, CPK, Sake Rok and the big, tall lady statue!   Casual spot. Lots of seating inside, a handful outside. Open kitchen view where you see them making waffles on the waffle makers. Cool decors, i.e. the waffle maker wall, garage like separator from the semi-outdoor seating to inside, chrome touches, etc.   I've tried \"The Original\" Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($9.25) and it is an extra $4 more to add Waffle Fries (aka side) and a drink!  Big, crispy, flavorful, juicy chicken breast in between a crunchy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside, airy, light, Belgian waffle, topped with chili honey (salty & sweet goodness!) and cider slaw! I'm a sucker for fries so those were awesome too, but talk about carb-overload!  Service was fast and the workers were on top of everything!   Really trying to find a reason to come back to try the Prosciutto & Swiss Sandwich, like ASAP! :P",

I saw an ad on FB for the $5 Crispy Chicken Waffle Sandwich on Waffle Wednesday (7/26/17) and have had this place in my Yelp bookmarks since I first moved to Vegas! I knew it was time to try it.  I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich but didn't know that I had to show the ad on my phone so she almost charged me full price but I mentioned the ad & she gave me the discount! Yay!   My boyfriend ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Waffle Sandwich & it was just phenomenal. Especially dipped in syrup, which they have at your disposal along with water & ketchup! The chicken here is super juicy & meaty with an amazing crust that's crunchy & flavorful. The spicy-ness was just right. The waffle was slightly sweet, crisp on the outside, & fluffy in the middle. I'm telling you, it was THE absolute perfect bite!  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was good but I'd prefer to not to have the sauce it comes with (the mayo of some sort) & no tomatoes next time. I couldn't taste the flavor of my waffle enough in this one. But of course, it was still delicious because that chicken is TO DIE FOR.  They bring you your food to your table, but we did clean up after ourselves. I will definitely come back to this place in the near future.",

Apparently, it was a new hype that we never heard about until we got there.   We ordered the The Original Fried Chicken & Waffle, Chicken Tenders with Fries and two shakes.  First of all, I'd like to give the disclaimer that the chicken comes out boiling hot -- which, in my opinion, is a plus! If you burn yourself, well, then it's your fault for not being adult enough, haha. I wasn't really feeling the breading too much, which is why I'm knocking off half a star. It was lightly seasoned and was a bit thin for my liking. The meat though was white and delicious.   The waffle was delicious and was a perfect combination for the chicken; however, the waffle broke as soon as my boyfriend picked it up. He had to use a fork and knife to eat it afterwards. As for the waffle fries ... well, let's say I was very disappointed. They tasted super chewy and like rubber. I love criss-cut fries too, but these were a total let down.   I also thought the ranch was a little watered down, which didn't go too well when dipping our crunch chicken tenders.   Overall, this place is OK if you're looking for a quick bite. They have a cool tabling technology where you just place your beeper on your table and the staff will know where your table is. We spent about $30+ for two people.",

The chicken was fried to perfection in a tasty batter and had an excellent flavor.  -Prosciutto and Swiss with arugula, whole grain mustard and a \"runny egg\". This was my favorite for sure! With you first bite breaking the egg it's yolk runs into every nook of the waffle getting a bit of each ingredient in every bite. So lite and simple yet satisfying!  -Nutella & Banana with a cream sauce. Looking for a sweet waffle to end this experience I had to go with this, Nutella being a favorite of mine. Not overly sweet but the warm waffle keeping the warm and gooey with the right amount of bananas and cream sauce this did not disappoint!  They have a counter with forks,knives,napkins, ketchup and of coarse waffle syrup. Most of the dishes we had didn't need syrup but just a little on the chicken and waffle wreaks took it over the top.",

There aren't many vegetarian options but I got the mushroom and goat cheese salad sandwich, which would have been a pretty decent salad. I'm not entirely sure why they needed to put it in a waffle. And then we both shared the appetizer plate of cheese fries (without the bacon). Once we finished, we felt sick the rest of the night - similar to how you feel after eating White Castle. It's just greasy food that has the novelty of being in a waffle. So if you're drunk, have at it. Otherwise, I'm going to pass.",

Prices are good and they have big pitchers of ice water to quench your post-nosh thirst.  I wasn't a fan of the loud music in the main counter area, but we sat in the quieter side dining room. There are also plenty of tables outside. I definitely recommend this spot for a tasty affordable meal in the land of insanely overpriced grub.",

Where else would you find In-N-Out, Shake Shack, Eggslut, and the soon to open, Momofuku and Halal Guys all in one town? Bruxie, a chicken and waffle favorite originating from Orange County, is now available in The Park.   Their waffle sandwich is made to perfectly pair with the chicken. The waffle is not sweet, somewhat thin, and stays crispy. It sandwiches a perfectly tender chicken breast. Most people try the original buttermilk chicken first, but I loved the Nashville-style hot chicken. The spicy and smoky flavor is not exactly that of the Nashville chicken I experienced at Hattie B's, but delicious nonetheless. I didn't see this item offered at any of the other Bruxie locations so this may be a Vegas exclusive.   If you're a fan of waffle cut fries, these are a must have.   I'll have to return to check out their sweet waffles including the Liege Belgian-style waffle. I'm also excited that they offer frozen custard, which hopefully does justice to the Wisconsin frozen custards I've tried.",

There were a few large groups of 5+ people but this was not an issue at all. service was fast and the restaurant was relatively quiet compared to pubs and other fast food places. Overall, we were in and out in about half an hour.  I had the green eggs and ham -- perfect for any breakfast lovers out there. Thinking that this breakfast item wasn't going to fill me up, I ordered two pc chicken tenders on the side ($1 each). The green eggs and ham was SO GOOD -- I also put one of the chicken tenders in there and it made it even better! By the end of my meal I was really full, so that was a bonus. My partner had the Nashville skillet with the spicy sauce on the side. He too was happy with his meal and he was really full as well (this is rare, to be honest). The servers were really friendly and chatted us up to ask where we were from, what our plans were, etc.  Overall, Bruxie was amazing. Wish it was in Toronto; I would definitely recommend, and I would definitely go again!",

On our first visit, we chose to split the Holy Chicken. It was mighty delicious.  The flavors popped in my mouth; savoring every bite. I knew that we had to be back. And that we did!  We went back with our friends and we decided on chicken and waffles.  I had the cheddar and bacon waffle. WOW!! We also had the fried pickles. Our friends raved about it too. So if you are near one of their SoCal locations or Vegas, it is a must stop kinda place. It's kinda good we don't have one close to us...I would probably be there every weekend. Good for business,  but not for my figure.",

I saw the BAMF and thought well at least I'd have Mac & Cheese if nothing else.  OMG...this had to be the best sandwich I've ever had.  It was spicy mac & cheese, crispy (but not too) chicken and the waffle was cooked to perfection. Husband and son had ones with eggs on them and loved them equally as well...not sure of name....too busy savoring my sandwich.  I'm a local.....strip is reserved for visitors so....

We stopped here on our way into Vegas since it was a mile or 2 before our hotel. My only complaint is the parking. It was terrible and being hungry already, the parking situation made me pretty hangry, but when we finally found a place to park the food was just as good as I remembered it if not better.   The last time I was there 2 years ago the charged you for a side of syrup, but this location has a syrup dispenser much like a ketchup dispenser so you don't have to hold back or waste $2 on a small thing of syrup. Our meal was delicious and I plan to make a habit out of stopping at Bruxie on my way into Vegas whenever I end up making the trip over there.",

My girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich combo with waddle fries and a strawberry lemonade! We wish the strawberry lemonade was bigger, but it was good, definitely fresh! I love how they have water by the condiments as well!!   The waffle fries were delicious, perfect salt and still soft, not too crunchy like it sat around the whole time. It's a nice place, quiet when they first open but starts getting busier around 10ish! It's a cute place!",

Awesome dude give the man a raise.   I ordered the Nashville Smokey and Spicy Chicken Waffle sandwich was ginormous and delicious.  Had enough kick paired with the slaw, dill pickles, and sweetness of the waffle and syrup was perfection made my taste buds dance.   I also ordered the Buffalo Style Waffle fries which were yum but they do get a bit soggy quick because of all the cheeses and sauces. We're tasty as well might be a bit heavy to eat all of this again at one time best to share the fries.   I have been to the many other Bruxies and once again they did not disappoint.  I am a fan and give the Bruxie in Vegas a repeat offender score.  Yummy in my tummy all day every day!",

The chicken was juicy and tender with extra crispy breeding. The pickles were perfect, not to thick or thin, cold and crunchy. I'd ask for extra next time.  Their soft drinks are all a little bit special, they make natural sodas and lemonades that are good enough you won't regret your soft drink like I so often do at other restaurants.  Two slight complaints: They're not open for breakfast, and the fries are just your average quality waffle style. Still totally 5 stars.",

Get the Nashville hot chicken and maybe try the spiked milkshake that I was unfortunately too full to try. Also they no longer have the poutine waffle fries.

    "text": "So glad I finally took the time to check this place out! I personally love chicken and waffles so the thought of a restaurant that combines both into unique sandwiches was a must try for me.  I came here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door. It definitely gets busy, but the line goes by pretty fast. You start by ordering at the counter and then they deliver your food out to you.   I ended up over ordering, typical me. I opted for the Nashville hot sandwich along with a chocolate shake and buffalo fries. I honestly loved everything I ordered. The sandwich was delicious, but huge. I ended up only eating half the waffle. The fries was great too! A little spicy, a little tangy and all delicious. Lastly the milkshake, ahhh, to die for. The perfect little dessert drink on top of the chicken and waffle goodness.   So glad I came here & will definitely be back again soon! Seems like it'd be a great place to check out before or after a concert at the T-Mobile arena.",

Instead of grabbing brunch at eggslut, my sister and I decided to walk over to Bruxie..which had a much shorter line. I ordered an original fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($9.25) and it arrived looking NOTHING like the menu picture. I decided to put that grievance aside, but was met with on overly crisp waffle paired with an oddly sized piece of chicken. The cider slaw and chili honey were pooled at the bottom of the waffle fold and shortly after picking up my sandwich it split in half...dumping all the honey and slaw over my tray. The waffle, being overcooked was not pleasant to eat as its rough texture was anything but the fluffy waffle I've experienced in the past (at their Orange County location).  VERDICT: Overpriced and not consistent with the quality of their other locations.",

The inside and outside has neat decor and tons of seating with even TV's too! So the organization of this place is casual with ordering up front with the cashier and then they deliver you your food made to order.   I tried the *Fried Chicken Poutine* which was delicious with the gravy, cheese curds, fried chicken pieces, and chives on top of waffle fries. The *Original Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich was interesting to taste with the chile honey sauce. I closed it out with dessert: *Lemon Cream & Berries Sweet Waffle* and *S'mores Sweet Waffle*... both were excellent!  The busser guy working the patio was also very friendly and on point.. so efficient being quick and helpful! Overall, Bruxie hits the spot for decently priced and crafty tasty eats, desserts, and lemonade with great service.",

I got the fried pickles and the Irish Nachos and like I said both great.  I was also taken back that my daughter asked for cheese and bacon only on some of the fries and it was like she asked for a steak or something not served.  Basically what she wanted was the Irish Nachos without the sour cream and chives but with cheddar cheese.  The guy had to go ask the kitchen if it was possible and only after I pressed the situation.  The kitchen of course said there was no problem and one of the cooks even looked at me confused as to why the guy was even asking.   But like I said, I liked my food and I may be back.",

It's almost always been hey the chicken was delicious but the waffles were meh or vice versa or they were both complete crap. So of course as people hyped Bruxie up I really didn't feel like I was missing anything. But having finally given Bruxie a chance I'm sure glad they ain't just serving that regular chicken and waffles stuff.  Went with the Original friend chicken and waffle sandwich. For me, anytime a business mentions the word original to anything on the menu I kind of have to order it. It was pretty good. The chicken was tasty. The waffles warm and freshly made. I think that's one of the things that separates Bruxie from a usual burger or sandwich spot. I don't really know of any burger spot making warm fresh made buns usually they're warmed up or just cold. That with chili honey, cider slaw, and pouring all that syrup makes it delicious.  I'd for sure be back cause it's not just chicken and waffles. They have waffle sandwiches filled with pulled pork, pastrami, etc. Salads, bacon infused mac and cheese, waffle desserts, waffle fries. I kind of want to go back now.  Service was excellent, fast and friendly. The girl who helped me actually knew the menu and had some great recommendations. Made me feel welcomed and want to come back.",

Their fried chicken is so juicy and tender, and all of the flavors in the chicken and waffle original are so scrumptious. We also got the buffalo and bleu, which was so tasty and it had just the right amount of kick for breakfast.   They have a fun soda selection and thanks to their friendly staff, we got to try many variations of the sodas, as well as their creamy custard. Wow, I wish we could go back right now.

You cannot go wrong with the Original Chicken and Waffle. The portion is huge and you eat that bad boy like a taco. And just like a taco, all your fillings (coleslaw & syrup) falls right out at the end. The chicken is tender and seasoned well. The waffle is cooked to perfection, so you don't have the flimsy, soggy or chewy situation.   I don't know what the kind of cheese is smothering the cheesy waffle fries, but I need more of it in my life.  I've also had the pleasure of eating the Fried Chicken Poutine waffles fries. The gravy and cheese curds just make the experience so much better. The meal is piled high on a skillet and I had to throw the towel in as I could not finish it.   I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",

The Nashville chicken was on point, it packs a pretty satisfying spice without burning off your taste buds.  Chicken strips were breaded evenly and pretty general.    If you get the nutella banana waffle I recommend getting the white cream on the side.  For some people the pairing is strange, so I was glad of having the option of not using it.   I will come back!  I want to try the original sandwich and the cheddar bacon waffle skillet too!",

Chicken wasn't dry at all.  Also, get their strawberry lemonade. REALLY good.",

    "text": "Wow, I have such mixed feelings. I want to give it 5 stars for how it started and 2 stars for how it ended.   Initially, I was completely blown away by the Nashville Hot Chicken (skillet with cheddar waffle). It was crispy and the portions were good. I love hot chicken and normally wish it was hotter at other places. Well this was HOT hot chicken!! Woohoo!   The waffle was meant to balance out the chicken spice. It had a lot of large sugar chunks on the outside which were welcome at first but over time it became way too sickly sweet. There were just too many sugar chunks. The waffle also was dense. So dense and kinda gooey on the inside. I was hoping for fluffy.   Between the sickly sweet waffle and the inferno chicken, my tastebuds are totally fried. They tried too hard to strike a balance between the intensely sweet and intensely hot.   Just too intense; too much of a good thing.",

    "text": "This was my first time to Bruxie, when I first saw the waffle sandwiches, I immediately knew I HAD to try it.   I went with my family for brunch around 10 am on a Wednesday. There was a decent amount of people at the restaurant. The service was also very nice, the lady taking our order was extremely kind.  I got the Original Chicken Waffle Sandwich, which was $11.95 and my brother got the Holy Chicken! Waffle Sandwich, which was also $11.95. I wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth, so I got the Nutella and Banana Waffle, $5.95. Also we got a side of Coleslaw for $2.95.  I first have to say, this place has the BEST waffle I've ever had in my life. I personally love crispy waffles than soft and cakey ones. Bruxie serves just the PERFECT waffle. It's crisp and not so thick, it perfectly companies the fried chicken. The Original Chicken Waffle Sandwich tasted AMAZING, the price was also very reasonable for the portions and quality of the food. The Coleslaw was the best I've ever had too. Now the dessert waffle, Nutella and Banana Waffle was just lovely. It tasted like HEAVEN. Everything harmonized together and in my opinion, the waffle went with the sweet better than the savory.  Overall incredible place, would definitely come again to try the other amazing menus.",

Very ultra modern and hip  2. Could be a great place to meet up friends like I did and catch up   Service  1. Overall 7/10; they were ok at the register and adequate with service.  Just like a glorified fast food so not like a sommelier type restaurant  2. Credit cards ok 3. Visit while on the strip and near the T-Mobile arena   MoJo 1.

    "text": "Unfortunately, my wife, and friends and I weren't pleased with the food. Our hotel concierge suggested eating there. The menu and vibe of the restaurant is great, but the quality of the food is mass production. They get tons of business, so I get it, but I was expecting a bit more southern cooked as it was described to me. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked in old oil, so while the inside was tender, the outside breaded portion was burnt. It wasn't seasoned a lot, so I had to revert to using hot sauce, which surprisingly I don't like to do because I LOVE to taste the flavor of the food over anything. My waffle was golden brown and looked amazing, but it was hard and extremely crunchy. I also ordered the fried pickles, which were amazing I have to say. There were 3 others in my party, and we all ordered a version of chicken and waffles, whether it was in sandwich form or not. The irish fries (I think its called), were okay, but I'm not sure if they were good because we were hungry and had already spent roughly $15-17 per person. Needless to say, this wasn't the best experience, and I'd probably not go back. I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for authentic southern style food. Not a knock on the establishment because again, they have a huge following, and we even waited 20 minutes, so they are many who love their food, I'm just not one of them.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.   Ambiance: Nothing special. It can get loud and super crowded with people waiting for tables. The place isn't large so big parties will have trouble finding seats. The tables, chairs, and stools are pretty typical for a semi fast food chain. I say semi because its not really fast food but kinda is at the same time.   Service: You go up to order and they bring the food to you. After you are done, you have to throw away your trash. So its not too much of a sit down and dine kind of service. Overall the servers are nice and polite.   Food: Honestly, I think I was really hyped but I just thought it was okay. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and 3 pieces of fried chicken (2 original/1 Nashville) that comes with a waffle. It was good but it wasn't the yummy dance good. I was ready to have the biggest foodgasm when I got my food but I think my mental desires/expections for the food really override what was actually getting ingested. Therefore I think it was okay. Don't get me wrong it is still delicious but I don't think I would crave for it or go out of my way to get it.  I thought it was just okay and since I would probably not go back I give it 3 stars.",

I mentioned fried chicken to my friends and they were totally on board!   There was a bit of a line and I have to say it didn't move very fast - I think there was only one person taking orders. But once we made it to the front and were given a little buzzer, things moved quickly. It was a beautiful day, so we waited at a table just outside for our food. Our buzzers actually never went off, our food was simply brought out one at a time.   I ordered the Irish Nachos. I'm a sucker for waffle fries and these totally delivered. They were absolutely covered in cheese sauce.   My friends both ordered the traditional fried chicken waffle sandwich and I got to have a few bites. It was delicious! The chicken had crunch and flavor. The waffle was light, crispy and savory - almost like a bread instead of a waffle. The sandwich also had slaw and honey - so good! Both moistened the waffle just a little, which made for a nice texture and balance to it's crunch.   I definitely want to come back to this place and try one of their dessert waffles, too!",

    "text": "The Holy Chicken...Best sandwich ever..... I've had chicken and waffles once before but never like this. First off, amazing chicken tenders. It'd be worth a trip just to get some tenders. After ordering, I was second guessing myself about how a sriracha sauce would go with everything. Short answer, amazing. It's a creamy mild sriracha sauce rather than just a straight sriracha. The bacon was great and then with a sunny side up egg, the whole thing just went together perfectly. I had to go back for another one before leaving Vegas.",

Location: I actually think they have outgrown this location, it's time to expand.   Overall: this is a self service shop once you order, so there really isn't much to say about the staff. The food is excellent and that is what makes it so popular. I recommend the BBQ waffle combo or original. The one knock I have on the place is limited seating. It's time to expand or add a real outdoor patio with fans.",

    "text": "Always excited to try different chicken and waffle places! First meal once we landed in Vegas and did not regret. The place is located at The Park it's a nice area with a lot of bars and restaurants. Super friendly staff and was patient with my boyfriend and I since it was our first time. Everything on the menu sounded so good! But we both went with The Original fried chicken and waffle sandwich, which also came with cider slaw. We also got waffle cut fries (not shareable you'll want your own) and mac n cheese (shareable) for extra sides. Everything was delicious nothing disappointing. The waffle was perfectly crisp not soggy and the chicken was flavorful and crispy skin. You can never go wrong with waffle fries and their basic mac n cheese was yummy as well. I would definitely come back again to try more of their menu!",

I thought everything about the place was awesome until I tried my sandwich.   I ordered the Nashville Hot. It might have been the sauce that comes on it but I was not a fan. The chicken didn't really have any flavors I was expecting - it was not spicy at all just very saucy. The relish sauce that came on the sandwich did not work for me. My boyfriend got the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich and mentioned that there was barely any sauce on his chicken/sandwich which was very unfortunate. We also got an order of waffle fries... which was basically 4 pieces. Not exactly worth $3.  I love the restaurant logo, concept, and atmosphere. Maybe my next experience will be better. Looks like I'll just have to check out another Bruxie the next time I find one around me!",

There were 2 water dispensers, which was appreciated since it was 104 degrees outside! The fried pickles were HUGE, perfectly battered & seasoned! The fried chicken was marinated in buttermilk batter, which gave it an amazingly delicious breading. It was topped with a little bit of coleslaw (not mayonaissey, thank goodness), & onion straws. It did not need the BBQ or cheese! I put syrup on the waffle \"sandwich\". The waffles were perfect, not too hard or too soft. I ate it open-face. It was too much for me to pick up & eat! I saw a man take on the challenge! Check out my pics!",

In my most honest of opinions, the drink size doesn't really give me any sense of value because the sandwich is so largely proportioned in contrast. I could choke to death on my final portions of the sandwich because there's only enough strawberry lemonade to get a person halfway through. At the end of the day, sandwiches here are firey (tasty). It's $30 for two people to eat, and you're gonna run out of juice. I don't mind paying when the quality is high, but I'm unsure if it was the amount of in-store traffic causing pressure on the person prepping the food or just luck of the draw that caused my 2nd visit here to be less impressive.",

    "text": "First time at Bruxie's. Came on a Wednesday around lunch time. Short line. We told the cashier it was our first time and she was super sweet and told us recommendations and good things to get on the menu! I ordered their most popular item, the holy chicken and my boyfriend ordered the 2 pcs of fried chicken with waffle on the side. My order was DELICIOUS !!!!! It was the BEST chicken waffle sandwich i have ever had! So tasty and all the flavors mixed so well to create an amazing sandwhich! I don't usually write to many reviews but I was so impressed by this sandwhich I decided to come here and write a review. My boyfriend said his was \"fckn amazing!!\". We loved the waffles so much we ordered another round. We will definitively we coming back here again! We are now fans of Bruxies!",

If you been to here before in Orange then the menu is similar.   For this visit, just wanted to try the chicken tender meal to see how it compares. The waffle cut fries were good and the chicken tenders were hot and juicy. I would definitely want to come back and try the chicken and waffle sandwich and the creme brulee dessert sandwich.   What is diffrent though is that they do have a small menu for beers on tap and they do carry Stiegl which is a plus! Next, they do provide a clean space with their napkins, condiments, syrup, and water cups. Finally the seating area is spacious but it won't seem like there will be a seating problem since it is located in The Park so there is a lot of outdoor seating too.  Finally it seems like they are training their staff still and I do appreciate that they did check on our table a lot to make sure we were ok. They do charge a 3% surcharge to ensure healthcare and benefits for their team for each transaction but it's not a big deal since everyone of their staff was helpful and friendly that our table interacted with. Definitely will be back to try more!",

Usually they are cooked in a VERY hot iron that caramelizes the pearl sugar lumps.  They cooked it in a normal iron then used a propane torch to \"caramelize\" the exterior.  The result was a charred exterior and almost raw (hard) lumps of of sugar.  Better than a regular waffle, but leaves a bit to be desired.",

My boyfriend got mad and started swearing at how unhealthy America was after we left! So, just be sure you're not coming here trying to be healthy! This is the place you come to indulge. It's easy to find as it's located at the entrance to The Park and New York, New York hotel and you don't have to walk through any casinos to access it. It's a fast food restaurant with a non-Vegas vibe. Total five stars food wise. Two starts for ambiance.",

While I have had chicken and waffles, the sandwich and skillet concept was new to me. And it works! Tried the original chicken and waffle sandwich, wasn't overly impressed with the chili honey sauce but it was decent. My favorite by far was the crispy chicken sandwich, with savory fried chicken breast with dill pickles sandwiched between waffles. Amazing. The waffles are crispy on the outside and soft inside. So good. The service both at the counter and table were great. This will be a staple for my next trip to Las Vegas.",

What exactly is it that Chicken brings to the table here?  I just can't figure it out...  Well, Bruxie came in to answer my query.  The menu offered many good options:  waffle/chicken sandies (thin, airy waffles), waffle/chicken skillet (which appear to be different thicker, possibly chewier waffles), and salads (the \"why bother\" option).  We opted to share the seasonal crispy chicken (How this was different from the regular?  Um, I'm unsure.  There didn't appear to be any pumpkin spice).  Anyways, it was good.  The chicken was indeed very crispy and moist in the center.  At the condiment area, you could add mustard, sriracha, etc.  I liked the sriracha the most.  I think it was b/c with the sandwich, you already had something deep fried and plopped with an abundant amount of mayo.  So the vinegary chili kind of cut the richness.  And maybe if the waffle was thicker...like the waffles they let you make at hotels...that would be stellar!    So I still don't think I need chicken with my waffles, but I'm certainly not against Bruxie's version.",

Their choices of items on waffles was vast and the price wasn't too bad compared to other on the strip restaurants. At first, we ordered the nutella and banana on a waffle, super good and the waffles are freshly made. The only thing I would suggest is to leave the sweet cream off, that way you can really taste the nutella more. On the way back to our hotel, we just had to stop in again to try the original chicken and waffle. The chicken was nice and juicy inside despite being fried and it has a little kick to it. Great flavor which left you wanting more. I wish they had the place on Jersey!  Staff were very friendly as well. The have indoor and outdoor seating with a live band who performs outside if your lucky.",

Pros: food is tasty and really good value, Cons: a bit greasy and portions are a bit smaller (by Vegas standards).   Food: Almost everything on the menu is a Belgian waffle sandwich of some sort. I ordered The Original--a fried chicken waffle sandwich. Would eat again -- chicken was crunchy and super flavorful (I think it had rosemary in the breading?) and the waffle is really light and airy. My friends ordered a plain waffle and the raspberry lemon cream waffle sandwich -- I'm not a fan of lemon cream and it was a bit soggy, but still tasty.   Value: Like I said, for being in Vegas $8-10 a sandwich is not bad at all. Left full and happy.   Atmosphere: It's in a really nice spot by New York New York with some outdoor benches. Inside is modern and spacious. The line was long, but we had no trouble finding a table.   Service: Staff were so so friendly and helpful!",

I love that everything is made from scratch and fresh to order, even the sodas.  I had the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and my husband got the original chicken strips with waffle fries. It was around $20.  The sandwich was huge. The waffle of the sandwich was great...not too thin or too thick and the right amount or chewy and crispy. My only complaint was that the description said slaw and pickles and it could have used A LOT more of both. The hot chicken was crispy and juicy. Super tasty, but not as spicy as I was expecting. The original chicken strips were excellent. Waffle fries were good, but nothing special.  I would really like to go back for some of there sweeter waffle options like the Creme Brulee Waffle.  They are absolutely worth checking out!!",

I split the original chicken sandwich with someone else, and also ordered a side of waffle fries & lemonade for only $3.50 more. Honestly, if you aren't too hungry or if you don't eat a lot in general, splitting one sandwich among two people is a good idea since it is a lot of food. The waffle was pretty thin & the chicken was flavorful, and it was overall easy to eat. I came back a day later to try the Angry mac & cheese, & for $6 it was so good! I loved the buffalo kick to it & the bacon on top the most. The only criticism I had about it was when it arrived, it was only slightly warm so it was cold pretty quickly.",

I highly appreciate the amazing customer service that was provided at Bruxie.

The chicken is done well for most all of it but the waffles on the waffle sandwiches are flimsy and lower quality. I thought the chicken sandwich (El Jefe) was slightly above average (mainly due to the toppings), but the chicken lacked some juiciness and was overly battered (I liked the hattie B's chicken sandwich more in the Lux).   All that being said, Bruxie has a fair amount of breakfast/brunch options at a fair price with fairly decent value. Expect to wait in line for 20+ minutes on the weekend mornings.",

Um.. my picky brain just couldn't grasp how this could work but I caved and we showed up! Let me start by saying this place is impressive! The menu is simple enough but there is something for everyone. They have all day breakfast selections as well as chicken tenders if a sandwich isn't your vibe. We decided to have the chicken and waffles order and a waffle sandwich as well as share an order of waffle fries. My husband isn't a fry guy but after having Bruxie's he said he now wants to try fries with all his meals lol  Bruxie also makes their own sodas which is super cool, they have a selection of regular and spicy ketchup as well as a never ending supply of syrup for us wafflelonians.  They make shakes and custards which we'll have to try when we go back home to Orange County. If you're looking for a delicious, reasonably priced meal on the strip then look no further!",

Very messy but the beef patty which is all hidden in this picture was cooked perfectly, and the flavor is right on mark. Thin waffle is not overwhelming and can hold all these stuff - Knife was still needed. However, I will recommend their chicken & waffle. they are wickedly yummy. #waffleburger #lasvegas #lasvegasfood #bruxie  Holy chicken waffle, awesome flavor! I usually don't like fried chicken but this rocks. The batter is light and with the great maple flavor. Highly recommended if you come to Vegas. Thin waffle is always a nice pair for this. #lasvegas #lasvegasfood #chickenwaffles #bruxie #holychicken",

The waffles were light, airy, with a slight crunch to it. The chicken? It was the best fried chicken I ever tasted. Outside was crunchy and had a nice amount of coating while the inside was juicy and tender.   My only complaint? I wish they would open another location that's not on the Strip!",

Light, airy, and crispy on the outside. I loved the burger and devoured it within 3 minutes! I'm a picky eater so this was a hit for me. My friend got the chicken burger with feta and oregano dressing. The chicken was small, but was sooo juicy and seasoned perfectly! The fries were also delicious, crispy, and seasoned well. I had the strawberry Palmer, which was refreshing but had absolutely no sweetness (which oddly I would have rather had a little more sweetness). Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to try the sweet desserts, but I'm willing to bet was also amazing. Definitely try this place out!",

    "text": "Take away the location, the view and the novelty of The Park, and all you are left with is an overpriced meal. I'll be honest, I had great hopes and expectations for this place, but my experience really took a turn to negative town, and then sped down that road, from the very beginning. Wanna hear more? Read on...  We got to the restaurant and the greeting was not much different than that I get at McDonalds. It was literally a \"NEXT\" cattle call to get to register. And that is when the fun started. I ordered a chicken finger meal with a strawberry lemonade and my girlfriend ordered a cobb salad with a Chardonnay. Sadly, what they call a Chardonnay on the menu, was actually a Pino Grigio (written right on the bottle), and the poorly-trained cashier kept insisting they were the same thing. I don't blame him for the mixup, I blame management.   Anyways, we were given a pager and told to sit anywhere we wanted to and the meal would come to us. We waited for what seemed like 10 minutes to receive my lemonade and then another 7 minutes for my food. Now, I do not mind waiting for good food to be served, but I did mind waiting that long to get an overlay sweetened strawberry lemonade and food that is very comparable to Jack-in-the-Box or Popeye's chicken. The fried chicken on both plates was half seasoned, borderline burned, and on the dry,  so it was nothing to write home about. In particular, the Cobb salad wasn't good nor visually appealing... tomato chucks were too big, the bacon had a stale taste and texture to it and the lettuce was straight out of a bag (I saw them refilling their salad station when we were leaving).  Like i said earlier, I really wanted the experience to be good. So, to make sure I left no proverbial stone unturned, I also ordered their Mac and Cheese which truly looked scrumptious. Unfortunately, that was yet another let down. They serve their Mac and Cheese in a cast iron skillet...but that is only for show. I thought they baked the dish in the oven (in the cast iron skillet) to melt the cheese, but they do not. In fact, the 'cheese' was gritty (a sure sign it was made with powered cheese), a bit on the cold side and under seasoned... not good.  Lastly, the appearance of the staff for it being such a new restaurant, left much to be desired. Uniforms are disheveled, and the staff is comprised of a bunch of teenagers who seem to be running the place. Want some delicious fried chicken? Keep walking because you will not find it here.",

The morning we were set to leave we decided to wander around the strip and find a small joint to eat in.  Well we wandered into Bruxie and didn't want to leave.  The food was so so so so so good!   Who ever thought you could replace sandwich bread with waffles?   And why didn't they think of it sooner?   These guys don't just trade up, they get creative.   There are all kinds of sandwiches on the menu.  Best of all is the classic chicken and waffles which is amped up a notch with the tastiest burbon sauce.  Absolutely fab!  I enjoyed every bite and will definitely pop in agian when we go back.",

We waited in line 10-15 minutes to order and only waited a little over 5 minutes for the food to come out. It was so fast!   I got the Holy Chicken! waffle sandwich and LOVED it! The sandwich was salty, crunchy, and sweet! Exactly what I was looking for in my chicken and waffles. The egg, bacon, and fried chicken combined made the sandwich very filling and worth the bang for my buck ($15.70 all in). The waffle was amazing - crispy, light, and super fresh. The fried chicken was balanced and didn't have too much breading, which I loved too.  The only weird thing was the waffle didn't come with syrup. Luckily they have a self serve syrup station so I grabbed some myself and put it on.  My sandwich at Bruxie was quick and delicious. I'll DEFINITELY be back the next time I'm in Vegas :))",

The chicken and waffle are a great balance, where one doesn't overpower the other. Hot, crispy French Fries. Portions that you think may be small, but fills you up nicely.

    "text": "The chicken and waffles at Bruxie are out of this world; this is one of the few places I'd give 6 stars based solely on the food if I could. Actually, my friend and I ended up finishing our meals and ordering a third sandwich to split because it was that amazing.  Food: - Green eggs and ham ($8.25) blew my mind. I absolutely loved the pesto paired with the egg, and the waffle was so crispy. Would definitely recommend if you want something lighter than fried chicken! - The original ($11.95) was also incredible. I've never had more tender and flavorful fried chicken in my life. - Crispy chicken ($11.95) wasn't bad, but probably my least favorite of the three we ordered. It tasted a bit generic, but I also had much less of an appetite by the time we got this, so that probably contributed to me not liking it as much.  Price: Kind of pricey after tax + tip (almost $45 for three sandwiches and fries), but considering this is Vegas, I'm not too surprised.  Service: Workers behind the counter were friendly, and food came out pretty quickly!  Ambiance: Casual and pretty calm on a weekday, although I can see it getting super busy during peak hours/weekends. Restrooms were clean, and there were a decent number of seats inside the restaurant.",

You can find something on the menu more affordable, but overall it's a bit pricey for me. :P",

    "text": "Honestly unexpected but this was probably my favourite breakfast/meal of the entire trip.   We went at opening (as usual, we always try to dine during non-peak hours when we travel to save stress) and there were only a few people waiting alongside with us.   They quickly took our orders and gave us one of those little buzzers to put on our table. This place is a very casual, family friendly, order and go kind of deal, lots of seating and a nice fan/ac inside though! There's also a bunch of outside, picnic table type seating outside.   I got the Holy Chicken! waffle sandwich (sriracha mayo, cheese, applewood smoked bacon, maple glazed fried chicken, sunny side up egg) my husband got the Sausage Egg and Cheese waffle sandwich.   This was SO good. The chicken was crisp with the lightest batter, it was well seasoned and flavourful, along with the maple glaze adding the perfect touch of sweetness. The sriracha mayo added some kick to cut through that richness, along with a perfectly cooked egg.   The thing that really made this great for me was that the waffle was light and thin enough for it to work in a sandwich. I've had some before where they're these hefty thick belgian waffles, but these made it perfect. The right balance and ratio for a good sandwich that doesn't make you feel sick afterward, even with fried chicken and bacon.   Add this to your list!",

My trip companions were intrigued by the waffle sandwich when walking on the strip earlier so we decided it would be a good post show meal stop. I didn't order the waffle sandwich. I ordered the chicken strips and fries. I read reviews that the chicken was well seasoned and very good. I decided to skip the sandwich and the chicken and waffle meal and go straight for the chicken. It didn't disappoint. Very good, very tender and well seasoned. Fries were delicious. Everything was served fresh and hot. I got the 4pc and I was so full I couldn't make room for a dessert waffle. Maybe next time. Only gripe? I don't think they give free refills on drinks.",

We stayed at Park MGM and needed some quick food in the morning, so we stopped by Bruxie. The food is exactly the same as the socal locations, but there is some Vegas tax foolery! I guess if you're not from socal, the prices wouldn't be so outrageous, and this place would be worth a try. But I just can't bring myself to be okay with getting the same food at higher prices.  The food itself is just like how I remember it. Bonus this time was that I got a vanilla latte. It was very sweet, which is how I like it. So you might want to tell them to adjust (if they can) if you're not as much of a sugar fiend as me.",

I really really liked their mushroom and goat cheese waffle sandwich, which also had sun dried tomatoes, arugula, and a balsamic glaze (vegetarian friendly!). Their chicken tenders were awesome too. I'll be coming back to eat them for the last time before I go back home!  We came around 12P.M. on a Friday afternoon and there was a line and probably waited about 15 minutes in it to order. There's a good amount of seating inside, and even more outside. If you do sit outside though (in the orange chairs) their buzzers don't work that far so you'd have to wait for your food inside then take your food out there. They have 3 black tables right outside where the buzzers do work.",

They replaced it with a Belgium waffle that is dry and has no flavor. The waffle skillet is why I've recommended so many to come to this place and now it's gone. Not impressed and definitely will think before visiting.  Service was still great and all, but that entree along was worth the wait in line.  Original post I had the Original Seasoned Chicken & Waffle Skillet. It has tenders and chicken breast and it's amazing!!! Well worth the price. It doesn't come with a side because it's a lot of food but I ordered the cheesy fries and they were good as well. I definitely recommend this meal with the Palmer drink. It's Strawberry lemonade with ice tea mixed in.",

Today they had a special for their barbecue chicken and waffle which was pretty much very similar to their original but what it up being about nine dollars rather than $12 for their classic. So we thought we would try that and it tasted pretty decent. However I got the waffle fries and those were pretty much cold. We thought fries would be especially when we got there right when the restaurant opened. You basically order your food here and go to your table and they bring you your food. It gets pretty messy with a sandwich and especially with syrup involves it can get sticky. They don't have a very convenient bathroom or sink that you can wash your hands right after eating. They have ice water near the napkins and condiments section which was nice. It took a little longer than I thought to get my order but I suppose when they cook the chicken when you order it it will take some time. If I am in town again I will probably visit again and hopefully my waffle fries will be hot next time!",

So we were headed back to our hotel at the Excalibur, when we saw Bruxie's; that was on Wednesday June 8th. We loved it sooooooo much, that we ate here everyday, including the morning that we boarded the plane.  This place is absolutely Freaking Amazing.  Shout out to Ms. Ann Marie and Mr. Andrea for providing exceptional customer service during our many visits.  We begged Ms. Ann Marie to pass the word to the powers that be, please come to Oklahoma and Texas; there is definitely markets waiting to be tapped!!!

I had tried Bruxies sometime awhile back at their location in Irvine and I think I got a dessert waffle, but really it didn't leave any lasting impression. This time around I got the breakfast sandwich the first day (bacon, egg and Gouda I think??) and it was so damn amazing. My sister got the Nashville chicken waffle and said it was also delicious. Also had the strawberry lemonade which was too sweet for my taste, but if you water it down a bit its good. Also got the coffee, which was strong. Second day, I wanted to try their chicken waffle which is what they're known for, so I got the Nashville chicken waffle which was amazing- has a bit of spice to it. It's located at the park which is between New York New York and Monte Carlo. For Vegas, this place is a hit because the food is so damn amazing and it is insanely cheap for Vegas.",

I totally recommend this sandwich. The Buffalo Chicken does have a small kick to it but it's barely noticable. I'm not even a buffalo sauce fan but this sandwich rocked my world. I'm definately going back again to explore more of the menu!",

I asked a waiter if this was chocolate and he stared at me like I had ten heads I actually ended up asking him if he even worked here when he was so surprised. He told me the ice cream was chocolate so I just agreed. A friend in the group saw how confused I was and brought my sundae up to the front where she was told that they don't even have chocolate ice cream..... Just wondering why it's even on the menu then ....  good thing their focus of the restaurant is not ice cream.",

Instead of ordering a waffle sandwich this time I changed it up and ordered their fried chicken with waffles. The chicken came out piping hot glistening with the Nashville Hot sauce. The batter was perfectly crisp and the sauce had a pretty good kick. Close to bordering too hot for someone that doesn't like too spicy.   The waffle was burned as you can see in my photos. I chalked it up to the bacon and sugar that was in the batter. But I think it was way overdone and looked burned. Not sure how they could have plated this and brought it out. The waffle was also sweet with pockets of sugar, designed I believe to cut the spicy chicken.   The Savior was the lemon and berry cream waffle. The cream was tart with a nice hint of lemon to offset the crispy and not burned waffle. The raspberries were a perfect compliment to top it all off.   The custard was more icy than what I remember at the other Bruxie locations. I didn't get the rich and creamy taste that I remembered from my other times.   Skip the fried chicken and stick to the waffle sandwiches. I noticed that everyone else's waffles were perfectly cooked except mine.",

    "text": "There is something about coming to Vegas and eating at restaurants that are located all over Los Angeles, but our first time dining there is in Vegas! ha! The same thing happened with EggSlut - last time I came to Vegas, I tried EggSlut for the first time even though there are a ton in LA!  Anywho, this time my family wanted a quick lunch and something we have not tried before, and I always wanted to try Bruxie and here we are! And here was one of the best meals of our trip or of any restaurant!  We had the $5 coupon for signing up online for their newsletter which was awesome, it's a great coupon, and although the prices are not too expensive, this makes it even cheaper!  We ordered two sandwiches - the Original and the Holy Chicken WOW these.are.dee.lish.ous!!!  The original has chili-honey, coleslaw, and their original seasoning. The chicken is so light, juicy, tender, while the batter is also so light and crispy, thin, and just so tasty with all the seasonings. The waffle is absolutely amazing - fluffy, crispy, and airy and oh so good, and together they make quite a good size sandwich! It isn't too spicy but the sweet-spicy honey-chili is amazing.  Now the Holy Chicken . . . my god this was amazing and almost puts Roscoe's to shame with the chicken and waffle combo!  Again, the delicious waffle, so fluffy and crispy and thin, but the chicken is glazed in maple syrup - seriously, what is better than maple syrup and fried chicken!? Thick, crispy applewood smoked bacon for some added savory-salty flavor. Thick slices of gooey cheddar cheese sticking to the waffle. A hint of sriracha for some kick, and the cherry-on-top, a fried egg cooked perfectly with the yolk running down the chicken and soaked up by the waffle!   Seriously, thank you Bruxie for this phenomenal lunch with the absolute best fried chicken, waffle, and combination of ingredients as well as the great service for something special and perfect in Las Vegas! I will be happy to return next time I am in Vegas and visit the LA locations!",

    "text": "Was craving breakfast, looked on Yelp, and discovered that my hotel was just a few minutes away from a Bruxie. I went with a few other friends and ordered their buffalo bleu waffle sandwich. My friends tried the crispy chicken (I think that's what it's called), one of the breakfast sandwiches, and a caesar salad. The pricing was fair considering it's more of a \"specialty\" type of food. The sandwich was about $10. The food came out really fast in less than 10 minutes.   The portion size is huge, I had difficulty finishing the whole thing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, really really good. I love buffalo sauce and I really enjoyed the sauce on the buffalo bleu. The coleslaw was just okay, a bit flavorless. I was expecting a bit more creamyness from the slaw to balance out the tangyness from the buffalo sauce. The first half of my sandwich was really good, but when I got to my second half it got to be too much. All you could taste was the strong buffalo sauce. Maybe it would be a good idea to get the buffalo sauce on the side? Regardless, this chicken and waffle combo really hit the spot. The waffle was light and crispy and did not get soggy at all. The waffle held up pretty well, which I was surprised! We ordered a side of waffle fries, which were pretty basic. I would skip on these.   All in all, Bruxie lives up to its hype. It's good fast food that will fill you up. I wouldn't mind coming back!",

If you're in Vegas or planning a trip, make sure you eat here at least once for an awesome breakfast or a hungover brunch.   The line can get a bit long during peak hours but it's worthy of the wait. I recommend the FC&W sandwich & the Nutella/Banana/Sweet Cream. This food was so good, I'm seriously getting hungry again just writing my review.  Menu:  It's not a big menu, but you're here for the FC&W so look to order one of the variations for a crowd pleaser.   Decor: They have a wall made from waffle irons. The seating is plentiful, but the amount of space they allowed themselves for lines to form is far from adequate. Also, when they are ringing people up, it's hard to get a single file line setup as people tend to bunch up. A designated line 1 & 2 should be implemented with one of those retractable rope devices.  Location: It's tucked away down a side street bordering the outskirts of the NYNY Casino. It's near the waterwalls.  See my photos of the outside, inside, & food.",

While we were eating, another worker came and said they had made an extra shake on accident and was wondering if I wanted it. Of course! I had a feeling it was because of my birthday because we were in the back of the restaurant and it was packed in there. But it could've been an accident, however it was nicely coated with whipped cream and caramel. It was a sweet gesture nonetheless. Customer service there both times were phenomenal and they were all very friendly. If I ever come to Vegas, I'm definitely stopping here!",

I'm no expert on chicken and waffles, but I know good food when I eat it- this was not just good, it was phenomenal. It made me believe in the existence of a benevolent god.

It was only about a 15 min walk from our hotel so we decided to give it a try. When we arrived the line was out the door and we contemplated going next door to Shake Shack instead but I'm so happy we decided to wait! My boyfriend and I both got the Holy Chicken! and shared an order of the Angry Mac & Cheese. The sandwiches were amazing! The chicken was seasoned well, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The combination of flavors from the sunny side egg, sriracha mayo, and saltiness from the bacon all meshed perfectly. I also added a little syrup which gave it a hint of sweetness. The waffle was also nice and crispy without being overdone. The mac & cheese was soooo good. There was a hint of spice from the buffalo sauce but nothing overwhelming. It was nice and creamy plus you can never go wrong anytime you add bacon to mac. For drinks we got the strawberry lemonade and added a shot of vodka for $5. Yes, I know it was breakfast but hey we were in Vegas....  The meal was so good that we thought about it our entire trip and wanted to go back before we left but ended up running out of time :( Hopefully we can visit another location during a future trip. This would be great in The Flats in Cleveland *hint hint*.",

The guy working the door was kind of enough to entertain us with his enthusiasm for waffles, that's always a plus while waiting in line. I took one of his suggestions and rolled with the creme brulee and a house coffee to wash it down- so delicious but a tad on the soggy side. I digress.  My buddies took stabs at the Chicken & Waffles, one of them being the spicy Nashville specialties. Great as always, but that's expected. Welcome to Vegas, Bruxie.",

It's a bit on the dry side and lacks in flavour. I do appreciate their idea of putting anything on the waffle like chicken, eggs, chorizo, avocado etc. That's what made the waffle taste much better. I ordered the Original Chicken & Waffle then substituted the chicken breast for a chicken thigh. Wanted a bit more flavour and a juicy tender piece of chicken. I've had chicken and waffles before, Roscoes still takes the cup.   Service: 3/5, not bad. There was not much of team work going on. Some were nice, some totally clueless to what was going on. Overall this was an OK experience.  If you're interested in Bruxie, try the LA location for more options.",

Even more unfortunately, my boyfriend had never tried chicken and waffles together before that place, and despite all of my ranting and raving about the True culinary masterpiece that is a good plate of chicken and waffles, he wasn't buying it. Well, thanks to this place, he understands now.  You have your choice of savory, sweet, traditional, and non-traditional waffle sandwiches.  To play it safe, we just stuck with the original and Nashville sandwiches.  What this place gets right, and what is most important about chicken and waffle sandwiches, is that the waffle can't be too soggy or crisp, and the chicken can't be overly fried. The waffle here has just the right amount of moisture, while still firm. The chicken isn't overly breaded or fried...it's like eating a chick-fil-a chicken breast, with different seasoning, on a good waffle. A+ quality.  My boyfriend wanted to return but since we were limited to less than a week's worth of breakfast, we sadly could not. Unfortunately, this was the best breakfast we had that week by far and we definitely wasted our money trying to find good breakfast elsewhere.",

This place was pretty crowded and looked promising so we decided to give it a try.  I've always been a fan of chicken and waffles so it started off on a good note. We ordered the original fried chicken and waffles and the original seasoned chicken tenders and fries. The staff was super friendly and the food came out rather quickly.   The chicken was seasoned superbly. Not too salty nor bland. The batter was super crispy and the chicken was perfect. Not dry at all. The chicken had a lot of flavor as well.   The waffles were thin and on the crispier side. They weren't dry at all however. They managed to be fluffy as well. Not too dense. It was pretty good.  The fries were not too special. Just regular fries. They were good.  If I ever come to Vegas again, I am definitely going to hit up this place.",

    "text": "Wacky and wonderful Bruxie!  On a recent friends trip to Vegas, our culinary needs collided beautifully - while I lust for fried chicken, they love all things waffle. In our pre-departure Yelping to find culinary delights, a friend happened upon Bruxie, where the two come together to make the ultimate brunch. We're so there!  Bruxie is a stand-alone joint on the strip (as in not connected with any of the giant hotels), so you'll have to brave Las Vegas Boulevard and the desert sunshine to reach it. Step away from the slots and tables, it's ok!  It's well worth it to support a business that hasn't been swallowed by a casino and is still a special treat away from home.   Inside Bruxie has the typical fast casual set-up: you peruse the menu from the line, order at the register, are handed a number, and then grab your table while the food is brought to you.  While there were many tempting treats, I figured on my first visit it was best to stick with their classic offering, the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  Served up as the menu says with chili honey and cider slaw, you also have a choice of sides - I opted for the fresh fruit to keep it lighter.   When your food arrives, you will be visually dazzled! It's a mild misnomer to call what Bruxie serves a sandwich, let's face it - this is a decadent taco, bro!  A thin but sturdy and very tasty waffle comprises the taco shell, and your chicken and slaw is generously stuffed inside, with a healthy drizzle of the honey. Syrup is also available at a condiment bar if you want to go full brunch on this bad boy. The size and the various liquids can overall make the tacowich a little difficult to eat, 2 of the 3 of us were relegated to fork n' knife it as the waffle split under duress, but no biggie! What's important here is the flavor, and this is a tasty offering. My waffle-loving friends were overjoyed by the waffle, and I was so happy the chicken was juicy and seasoned perfectly!  All the other flavor elements added balance and variety, and still let the chicken be the star, as it should be. I was also happy the side cup of fruit was standard but luckily not canned - thank you for not cheaping out on fresh produce!    Bruxie is definitely recommended for indulgent brunchie needs at all hours, and whether you lust for waffles, fried bird, or the delightful marriage of the two, you will be happy!",

The waffle itself was something I've never tasted before.  It was light and crispy but you have to put syrup on it or it'll taste like nothing.  I really liked how light the waffle tasted to it because all the other waffles I eat are thick. The chicken itself was delicious and it was the perfect amount of spiciness! The only thing that would have made it better was if it wasn't as oily... I know it was fried so its not brainer that the skin would be oily but this oil was on another level.   Overall I think if you want chicken and waffles in Vegas then you have better choices.",

    "text": "So night and day from my experience at China Poblano last night! Thank you YELPers for steering me here. I am not a big chicken and waffles fan because the chicken is usually dry or bland and the waffle is usually basic. Thank you BRUXIE for showing me what True chicken and waffles are suppose to be. I got the chicken and waffle skillet after a recommendation from a food runner there (who took the time to discuss the menu with me :-))  DELICIOUS from the first to the last bite. The chicken was moist, fries well, and seasoned all the way through. The waffle was dense and flavorful. I don't do a lot of bacon infused foods, so I was hesitant but the bacon was not overpowering and real complemented all the flavors.   The service was great. Multiple people asked how the food was, which came out promptly despite the small rush they had. There were people constantly circling to clear plates, offer refills, and just saying hello with a welcome smile.  I have already told a few friends in Vegas to come here, I will be back!",

The sodas are made with real sugar cane. The coke tasted like the Mexican coke!  We ordered chicken fingers it came with fries. The fries need to be cruncher they are blond in color.  Also ordered bacon cheddar waffle which was horrible.  it has sugar cane pearls large enough to not melt and I'm guessing to add extra crunch.  This is not pleasant to eat! Also the waffle is extremely doughy. I think they're sugar pearls cause it to not bake properly leaving a very doughy and dense waffle. not my favorite.   we also ordered the waffle chicken sandwich that was very delicious chicken is very tender juicy flavorful waffle could be slightly cruncher. it was on the blonde side, soft side. Not saying I wanted it dry and hard. But if serving with hot crunchy chicken sandwich it needs to hold.   For dessert we ordered  waffle sundae the custard ice cream that came with it was very creamy very delicious! We ask for the regular waffle. Not the one on the menu since the sundae waffle is a Liege, all the deserts uses this kind. Liege is the crystal pearl raw sugar waffle think undercooked dense.  they were more than happy to accommodate our order and change the waffle to the one served with the chix sandwich. It was very delicious has dark chocolate, not sweet to compliment all the other sugar in the sundae the peanuts were nice and roasted very crunchy, whipped cream was quality whipped cream.  Over-all maybe going back for just breakfast but as of now maybe next time.I not worth $50",

Not just a heads up my poor review of this place has only to do with the wait time. It shouldn't take over an hour to serve 3 waffle sandwiches so to speak. I found the food excellent for the most part although the berry one was a bit tart for me. I would go here again granted I got better service and got two spicy chicken waffles.

Guy taking order seemed a bit distracted, and made a small mistake on our order.  We each had a breakfast waffle sandwich; one sausage, one bacon.

The strawberry lemonade is pretty good too.",

There was already a line (some being post EDC wakin up and probably getting a bite before leaving town) early in the afternoon. The line went by quick and we got our food fairly quick as well.   Restaurant wise, I has a decent amount of seating inside but there was seating outside too. Originally my friends and I wanted to sit outside but wind randomly picked up so we opt'ed to sit inside.   I've tried Bruxie in Cali at Huntington Beach in the past and I feel like that experience was much better than this one  I had ordered \"The Original\" which was a fried chicken & waffle sandwich with original seasoned breast, chili honey, and cider slaw, a side of waffle cut fries, and a strawberry lemonade.   I had recalled the sandwich I had gotten at Huntington Beach be MUCH larger. I remember getting my order and was like WOW... how am I putting this in my mouth (.... ssshhh....) but this time, I felt underwhelmed. Size of the waffle seems normal/reasonable/similar but the size/thickness of the chicken and the amount of slaw was definitely underwhelming. If anything, I'd say this was half the size of what I've experienced. Presentation was flat. Size was flat. Flavor was a bit one noted and the \"skin\" wasn't that crispy.   Even my friend's irish nachos that's waffle cut fries w/ cheese sauce, smoked bacon, chives, sour cream looked really sad. All the noted toppings were minimal...   I am happy I did get to try this location at least once but now I don't have to come back. It's quite a pain to come down here as a local Lol especially since everyones charging for parking nowadays. I know its a restaurant on the strip but dang... maybe that's why our food came out fairly quickly. Everything just sitting around waiting to be put together, not freshly made",

Quick service which was great because it isnt a sit and order type place and we were getting ready for a busy day. Size was good. I expected the waffle to be like a typical waffle, fluffy and a little bit sweet...it wasnt. It tasted more like toasted sliced bread. Not bad, but just wasnt what I was thinking it would be. By it resembling more bread it is much easier to eat the entire thing. I liked the establishment, lots of natural light and a huge fan to keep you cool. Menu was small as far as offerings but I think very well rounded.",

It's a casual place where you order at the register and get a buzzer and grab a seat. I ordered the chicken strips but the cashier made a mistake and rang me up for the original chicken and waffle sandwich. When it came out it looked so good that I kept it and thought I'll try the chicken strips next time.   Our order was the sandwich, waffle fries, the country sausage breakfast waffle sandwich, angry mac and cheese, strawberry lemonade, and a ginger beer.   The sandwiches were a good size. The chicken was crispy and had a sweet and spicy taste. We could have shared a sandwich or took the rest home for leftovers if we weren't going to a concert. The waffle fries dipped in ranch were so good. The angry mac and cheese was super tasty and a large portion good for sharing.   The food was good. Service was good. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken and waffle, chicken strips, and Irish nachos.",

In our 6 day Vegas trip, I tried fried pickles from three different places and Bruxie's were the best. First, they're cut thick, which is different than most (thinner slices/cut like spears). Second, they dredge in delicious seasoning (like their fried chicken). I loved that the seasoning had a bit of heat.   I was lucky that when I arrived, there was only 2 people in front of me. After, a huge line started forming out of the door.   I will say that they seem incredibly inefficient. I watched my pickles sit under the heat lamp for a solid 5 minutes until a worker came by to fulfill/bag my order.   81/365",

I decided to try Bruxie, and chances are good that I'll return the next time I'm in Vegas.   I arrived around 9 p.m. on a Sunday night, and the place was pretty empty. It's the kind of place where you place your order and then take a pager to your seat. I was able to order immediately upon arrival, and I had my food between five and ten minutes later.   I ordered the original fried chicken sandwich, and I thought it was really good. The waffle was mildly sweet, slightly crunchy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. The chicken was juicy with a crispy, flavorful breading. The slaw added the perfect amount of tangy acidity.   This is definitely one of the best places to get relatively inexpensive food when you're not looking for a high-end dining experience around the strip.",

I think this was a classic case of ordering the wrong item because when I took apart my sandwich and tried the waffle and fried chicken separately, they were actually really good! I wish I had ordered a classic waffle and chicken sandwich with some syrup instead. After eating what I had ordered, it seems that chicken and waffles is a dish best left alone.   I will come back when I can to try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "I knew about Bruxie from back in the day when they opened their first flagship store back in Old Towne Orange. I knew the owner because him and his father would eat at my mom's restaurant nearby. I never really tried their savory waffles until now. Wow. Now I know why they were so busy. You can't go wrong with fried chicken sandwiches in between waffles.   I ate at this location twice during my trip to Las Vegas. Original spicy chicken, waffle cut fries, strawberry lemonade and their Wisconsin frozen custard- everything was fresh and so good.   Very casual environment. You order at the counter, and they give you a gps tracker where your food gets dropped off at whichever table you choose. Inside and outside patio dining. They also have beer and wine options.  Self serve area for ketchup and waffle sauce (basically sweet syrup) and napkins.   Crispy chicken fried in clean oil and light fluffy waffles- what a combo!  Service is efficient. Nobody stood out in an extraordinary way. I did have one woman try to clear my plate when I was still eating- not cool. They have a spot to tip but actions like that get big fat zero dollars from me. I am a good tipper because of being part of the restaurant industry for many years, so mediocre and rushed service gets no love from me.   Come for the food.",

    "text": "\"Mmm... Fried chicken, fly vixen. Give me heart disease, but need you in my kitchen.\" -Nasty Nas  Bruxie is amaze. It may not be the most traditional introduction to chicken waffles that I could have had, but it was such a good one. And it absolutely helps that I'm a sucker for breakfast food at all hours. That said, the breakfast thing isn't even that big a part of what they do at Bruxie.   Between the exquisite sides (Angry Mac & Cheese, Irish Nachos, and Fried Pickles) and delectable entrees (a Southern BBQ Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich and a Bacon-Cheddar Waffle), there wasn't one thing that I don't wish I could have eaten more of. Like, A LOT more of. I could easily eat like five servings of just the angry mac & cheese. The gooey cheddar cheese, succulent pieces of bacon, and slight kick of buffalo sauce is so delicious, it'll make you punch a baby right in its potato face. The fried pickles, while not exactly holding their breading as well as I would have liked and being extremely hot (albeit fresh), were still so yummy. The breading was well-seasoned and they were nice big chunks of goodness to be dunked in old faithful, Ranch dressing. The bacon-cheddar waffle was also so good. Imbued with little pearls of sugar and bacon, the waffle was just the right amount of crisp and airy in all the right places. With maple butter slathered on top of it, it was one decadent bite that I'm all about. And the Southern BBQ Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. Oh man, what a mouthful. A mouthful of savory, warm, crunchy, cheesy heaven. Not only does the sandwich bring it in the taste and texture department, but it will absolutely fill you up. I swear, I felt as though I could barely move after finishing up. I could have sat there, sedentary listening to Ariana Grande and Bon Jovi play all day long. And the Irish Nachos, oh man. It's like they were tailor-made to be consumed after a night of drinks. The waffle fries covered in melty cheese, sour cream, bacon, and chives are such a perfect combination to soak up all that alcohol.  Basically, you can hit up Bruxie at literally any time of the day and find an amazing meal to suit your needs. I absolutely cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "I had walked by this place numerous times during my trip in Vegas. I was solo, had no one to confer with I decided to stop and check this place out. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu & offered suggestions when asked.  While I am normally one that goes for fine dining, every know & then a fast casual spot does the trick. So while heading down the strip i figured this was where i would stop for a quick bite before heading to ride the High Roller. I want feeling the waffle sandwich which they are known for, instead I tried the cheddar bacon waffle.. with kicker chicken (breast). I must admit, I was a little leery of a waffle with cheddar and bacon inside but it was delicious! The waffle was soft & tender and the cheddar blended perfectly. The chicken was crispy and a lil spicey.. the perfect combination for me.   The only drawback was the waffle seemed to have been pieces of actual sugar in the waffle. Guess that was the pearl sugar listed on the menu. I didn't like that at all. I figured that was the sugar used in the production of the waffle. Overall, it was a good experience but please... hold the sugar for being blended into t by e waffle as an ingredient... not pieces of a sugar cube cooked into the waffle. I don't prefer my waffles to crunch.",

    "text": "As I started to plot out where to eat for all of my meals while I was going to be in town, picking the last spot to go to before my flight home was by far the easiest.  I mean, how could I not hit up Bruxie?!  Considering how much I LOVED their Irvine location, this practically guaranteed a delicious ending to my trip.  Which kind of explains why I did it again last month!  Well, that and the fact that they're just that good!  Located on the outside of New York New York, and right next to Shake Shack (also love!), it's great how this part of The Strip finally has some better food options (we wouldn't even bother before).  Thankfully, everything about this Bruxie was just as amazing as the one in Irvine.  In fact, if anything, the menu actually looked slightly better.  The range of options was the same (fried chicken, waffle sandwiches, salads, etc.), but there seemed to be more variety now!  -- HOLY CHICKEN - Maple Glazed Fried Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Sriracha Sauce, Sunny-side Up Egg...$11.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bruxie-las-vegas?select=qwDv2kffPT3T-7ZqPHJIgA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brux...</a>) Aside from how the waffle fell apart after just a few bites (it needed to be crispier), I loved everything about this!  The egg, cheese, and bacon were perfect complements and I liked the glaze's sweetness.  The star was the chicken though - crispy, juicy, and super flavorful!  -- KICKIN' CHICKEN - Spicy & Smokey, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Romaine, Pickles...$11.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bruxie-las-vegas?select=BvswIgx2g-M04lPohc41Zg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brux...</a>) Even though it wasn't as spicy (or kickin', if you will) as I thought'd be, I thought this was great!  The chicken was moist, nicely battered, and still very tasty.  What's more, the tangy sauce was awesome and the waffle was much better this time around!  For all of their waffle sandwiches, you can make it a combo by adding a side of waffle fries and a drink (with free refills) for $3.95 more.  Sure, the sandwiches are filling enough on their own, but this is well worth the money!  The waffle fries are insanely good (perfectly crispy, lightly salted) and I LOVE their Strawberry Lemonade (a little sweet, but nothing a little more water won't fix).  Despite having tried something different every time I've been to Bruxie (here and Irvine), I'm still disappointed in myself for not having tried their regular fried chicken yet!  Fried chicken & waffles dishes have failed me before (a la Roscoe's), but I can't imagine I'd have to worry about that here.  I guess I have even more reason to come back!  Alhough, considering how much I love these guys, I never really needed another one.",

I prefer a more savory chicken and waffles experience so this really hit the spot for me. I love waffle fries and there's were delicious, but I wouldn't recommend the milkshake that I got.",

He's been trying to get me to come here with him for a year.  Yep, I should have come with him sooner because I think he might be right.  We got our items to-go which made me think that it wouldn't be tasty by the time we walked back to MGM, got in the car and drove back to Cosmopolitan.  Again, I was wrong.  Fried chicken that tastes good lukewarm?  That's still crunchy?!?!  Sign me up please!  I can only imagine how seriously delicious it is hot, fresh from the fryer.  I got the caramel custard as well.  This custard was delicious!  Not too sweet and had a great fluffy texture.  I cannot wait to come back here and try EVERYTHING else on the menu.

Pretty long wait for under-seasoned chicken and so much sauce the waffle gets soggy and starts to fall apart. I'm a texture gal and soggy food just doesn't cut it for me so even eating this mess with a fork was a no go. Maybe I didn't order the right thing and maybe it's just not my cup of tea but I wasn't that impressed. The service was so so, you got what you needed but the employees as a whole weren't very friendly.   I will say this - as long as they are milking this trend their decor was spot on and pretty cool.

I've heard great things about locations in SoCal and even joined their mailing list before this one opened. We have several great chicken sandwich spots in town and this one, after a long wait that probably overinflated my expectations, ranked just average.  Menu gets some seasonal additions and changes, and the item I came in for was no longer available (Cali Pesto Chick). I got the BAMF (fried chicken, 2 cheeses, macaroni, and peppers) and my pescatarian partner in crime got the roasted mushroom and goat cheese, both on waffles. The chicken was large with a thin, flavorful crust, but the toppings weren't so great- mac is premade with a sauce that includes bacon, angry cheese sauce tasted artificial. Mushroom and cheese combo was okay, the sundried tomatoes were an odd addition. We both liked the waffles more than expected, they were soft but held up surprisingly well. Portion size for both meals was fair for the price and location.  NOTE: only one vegetarian option, macaroni cannot be made vegetarian",

    "text": "Bruxie was probably my favorite meal that I had in Las Vegas! The restaurant is located right outside New York New York in the Park section. I showed up at a pretty off time, so I didn't have to wait in line. You place your order at the register and then they bring your meal to your table. I decided on the B.A.M.F with a Strawberry Lemonade and a side of fries.   The waffle was absolutely huge but perfectly cooked, soft but still had a nice crunch. The chicken was delicious and very moist, the angry mac and cheese and pepperoncinis definitely get the sandwich a kick, but it wasn't intolerable. The fries were nice and crispy, I also loved that they had spicy ketchup to dip them in which was pretty unique.  Overall, an awesome place to get breakfast/lunch/dinner! The staff was really friendly and even came to my table to offer me a refill and see if I needed anything else. My flight got changed or I would have come back for breakfast, I went to Eggslut at the Cosmo and thought this was way better! This will be my go-to spot for sure.",

It was relatively busy but we were in and out in about 30 minutes!   Spiced tots were more like \"seasoned\" tots - they were not spicy at all but just had some flavor to them. Not bad at all! Just not spicy like the name hints.  The baked waffles were SO FLUFFY! I've never had a waffle so airy and light. But don't let that fool you, they are big and I was full so quickly!   My husband had the Holy Chicken and he said it was full of flavor and also very filling. They serve large portions here!!",

But once we got over there we saw it was worth it, they have a water area outside, a big chess game and some big plastic chairs. The teenager and the baby were both thrilled by the outside scenery (which is not a part of the restaurant).  The line goes out the door depending on the time but the service is fast. The seating is first come first serve.   We ordered the holy chicken and the fried chicken and waffle. Two of each and one milkshake. We all agreed the chicken was really yummy. My husband found the holy chicken overall a little too sweet, but I did not. I would say go in with the syrup conservatively.   My one complaint is the syrup is cold, for a place whose menu surrounds the waffle I would think they would offer warm syrup?!   We will be back for sure, just might try something else on the menu to see if it's just as good.",

    "text": "Top quality ingredients, and real maple syrup trump the heavy, high fat, no apologies menu at Bruxie. The only light things on the menu are the holes in the waffle fries.   Come hungry.  I've seen a few waffle and waffle sandwich places fail. This one is very busy, mostly because of the meager breakfast and brunch offerings in the hangover capital of America.   It's certainly not the best chicken and waffles that I've ever had, but it was very good. They have a good staff that moves food, and keeps tables clean. They don't cut corners on the product or the condiments.  They have a Bloody Mary that is really good. So why 3 stars?  Was it worth the ten minute walk, and the $8 parking fee at the Park MGM garage?   No.   Aside from validation, which I know isn't happening, I had hoped for a restaurant with more comfort in its decor for a comfort food restaurant. Tables that felt more like a cool southern joint, and less like a third-rate Zaxby's fast-food McMeal kind of feel.    The service tried to offset it, but cheap tables make good food seem cheaper. Given their high prices, another fail, that isn't helping their case for \"worth it.\"  If Wendy's is your idea of quality dining, this is your spot. Get 'er done!  Come soon, though, before the fad burns out. There is little here past various riffs on chicken and waffles, and fast food that you could get anywhere else for far less.",

My brother in law found this spot on yelp, I decided to pass due to it being a Friday night and this place is on the strip, so I opted to stay home and have them bring me back something. They came home completely impressed and with a chicken strip combo for me.   I loved it!!! I was expecting for the food to arrive cold and soggy since it's a 15 min drive from my house to the strip, but that wasn't the case.   I had to try this place out in person!   We went yesterday (07/11) and it was packed! It's located outside the New York New York and it's in between MGM Park. There is an entrance to the casino right next to the restaurant, so no need to walk around the entire outside if you don't want to.  I do suggest that if you have multiple people in your group, send one of them to look for a table while you place the order.   My husband order the Holy Chicken it has Maple Glazed Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Sriracha Sauce, Sunny-Side Up Egg, served, of course in a waffle! I had to get the 6 tenders and fries with the Bruxie cheese sauce and the Angry Cheese Sauce, which I loved!   This placed nailed chicken and waffles!!! You definitely won't be disappointed! And you better believe that as I'm writing this, I'm trying to convince my husband to take me right now!",

Both were cooked just the way I liked it! What made the difference is that it was fresh. The majority of the menu items were variances on the fried chicken sandwich. They all looked delicious.  Clean interior, friendly staff and plenty of room to dine in. There's even ice water in a big pitcher ready for the guests. Helpful for those hot Vegas summers!   I would go back.

Just plain Waffle House; I wouldn't come back.",

It was ok, got the egg on it since it was brunch and I couldn't really eat it without using a fork.  It was ok, just not some awesome 5 star place. Also, it's very casual, order and they bring it to you.",

I got the buffalo chicken waffle and a Hefeweizen. OMG I was in heaven! my bf got the syrup skillet. He loved his too. I wish we had one in Salt Lake! Will definitely be back when in Vegas!

The food came quicker than expected, the food looked really tasty. There was one downside to this though, when ordering i specifically asked for no sauce at all, but when my food came there was mayonnaise on it. They replaced the waffle in no time but that is not the reason why this has a low rating.  The chicken had a very nice look to it, the texture of it was decent, and it could pass for real nashville hot chicken. But looks isn't what makes the food good. The chicken was indeed tender, and crispy. But, the chicken had no flavor what so ever, it tasted like as if it was overcooked or if they used old oil. The waffle just tasted like a wafer with no flavor and almost made me puke when I was eating the waffle by itself. The place itself has a very nice aesthetic to it and it could be a good hangout spot and if you're looking for something quick to eat, very outgoing and polite employees. But dinner wise, I wouldn't think twice about not going to this place again, everything but the food is good about this place. I feel like this is just an over-hyped place that you should just avoid.",

Whether you go with the original chicken and waffles, their spicy version, or the sweetness of lemon cream and berries you won't go away unsatisfied. The salads are also amazing and their waffle fries make the perfect pair with any sandwich. I've tried many places and haven't found anyone who gets this combination right....until now. Some places have soggy waffles, others make their waffles way too thick and drown out the chicken and yet others just can't get the chicken right. The location on the strip is perfect for people watching, it's clean, busy and definitely awesome. The staff is very friendly and helpful, we were being checked on quite often, our drinks were constantly topped off and our table remained clean and clutter free throughout our meal. I can see a drawback for locals though, there is very little parking nearby so that would definitely create a headache. Next time you're in Vegas, give Bruxie a try, it wil definitely surprise you how good it really is.",

    "text": "The Perfect Food Spot to hit up before going out on the Strip  My co-worker and I stumbled upon this place as we were walking the strip after our conference.  We were looking for something that was different and was not crowded.  Monday Night Football was on TV.  As we were walking from the MGM Grand to mid strip, I saw all the 4 and 5 stars on Yelp for Bruxie.  So we thought we give it a try, we were not disappointed!  I ordered the 2 piece with Mac and Cheese.  After I burnt the top of my mouth with the fresh out of the fryer fried chicken, I was in heaven.  The syrup adds an sweetness to the saltiness of the outer crust of the chicken.  The chicken was not dry inside and the crust was not too hard.  The mac and cheese was cheesy and they use more white chesses that added a bitter taste to the mac and cheese.  But that went perfect with the Chicken.    I could not even eat all of my food.  My only complaint is that beer prices are a bit high there.  Now, I would go into greater detail but you know, the adventures of Las Vegas kinda fogged my view up.  But when I did wake up my co-worker and I were talking about how that was some good fried chicken.  So if you are looking for a spot when you are in Vegas, Bruxie will be a good option.  Bruxie's gets a solid 7.5 on my \"I judge Fried Chicken on the Yo' Granny's Fried Chicken Scale\". Here is quick break down of my \"Fried Chicken on Yo' Granny Fried Chicken Scale\"  From Poppies/KFC (ugh nasty 1-4) to the midpoint (not bad, and yes this is where most fried chicken falls 4-9) to the cannot be topped Granny's Fried Chicken (a perfect 10).  I am very picky about my fried chicken if you can not tell.   So if you are looking for a spot when you are in Vegas, Bruxie will be a good option.",

Perhaps they over fried it, cause it was not golden brown but rather a very dark color. Or maybe its all the over the top seasoning in the breading that gave it that unattractive color. The sauce is much too sweet and the tiny spoonful of coleslaw they give you with it, is hardly enough to cut through all that \"carby\" and greasy food. I desperately wanted something acidic to cut through the grease or at least more coleslaw to break that monotony of flavor.",

The strips are large in size and the buffalo sauce had a good amount of spice but a great flavor to go with the heat. She also had waffle fries with ranch on the side.

I normally want to eat veggies or lighter fare, so it was not my first choice.   Expecting to feel like a fatty after (and probably tired), I was surprised how light and tasty it was.  First off, it's not chicken and waffles like soul food style, you won't eat it with a fork and knife.  You eat it like a taco and it's not humongous.  II had the Nashville style hot, but I took a few bites of the hamburger and the creme brulee.  They were all yummy.  This place is super cute and trendy.  You walk up and order and like panera or some of those other places, they will bring your food out to you.  It's good for a quick bite.  I would definite go here again.",

I also ordered one of their homemade sodas (Cola, and my boyfriend ordered a spiced cola which is similar to Dr. Pepper) and I really enjoyed those as well. The spiced cola is a little strong and bf didn't like it, so he gave it to me. It takes a little getting used to but I liked it! The service was excellent! We went on a Monday evening so it wasn't busy, and the staff approached us while we were eating to ask if we needed anything and even offered to give my brother a refill. Wasn't expecting it since it had a fast food style ordering system but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, the food is a tad pricey for what you get, but I'm a fan of chicken and waffles. Staff and service were great and so was the food!",

It's where you hear about something for the first time or notice something you hadn't before and suddenly you hear and see that thing EVERYWHERE. In the case of Bruxie, it's not just in your head. Bruxies are popping up everywhere and for a good reason. The chicken and waffles here are simple, cheap and tasty.  Park at New York New York (on a night without an event at the T Mobile Arena so you can get free parking!) Walk toward the strip. Pass CPK, pass Beerhaus (I know, it's tempting to stop there). Stand in line. Order your food (I suggest the Original). Sit down. Wait for food. Consume everything. Order more to go while eating.  The Original: Fried chicken on a waffle (Only 250 kcal?!) Nothing fancy, nothing worth taking a picture of... But it's good. The waffle isn't sweet, just think of it as an alternative to bread. The maple syrup is on the self serve counter for you to drown your meal, if that's your thing. For me, the sandwich is a little bland without syrup.  California Pesto Chicken: Very light, very simple. I would order it again.  The Lemon Cream and Berries: The lemon custard was a little too overpowering for me and it made the waffles taste too bland in comparison. Save the dessert for someplace else.  The sodas are made from cane surgar, no caffeine (except from the cola) and are worth ordering. They also serve alcohol if that's what you're looking for!  Sit outside and enjoy the weather (before it gets too hot!) The street performers outside are all paid by The Park- you won't find \"Mickey\" and \"Dora\" here ;)",

So outside of the walls of NYNY sits Bruxie in the blossoming Park area between it and Monte Carlo. Prime real estate indeed with this area flourishing, but the whole \"don't eat what we have at home\" theory plays in sometimes because rarely do I see this place packed.  I had a random craving for chicken fingers and totally overlooked this, but glad I didn't this time. The batter was crispy and flaky, but was not falling off the chicken so they certainly represented on that night. The chicken itself was very moist and not a bite over cooked as I've grown used to. It did come partnered with a Carolina BBQ sauce which took the meal to new heights and even the herb ranch dressing left me clucking with pleasure.  I didn't quite care much for the staff as they weren't all that friendly, but I focused on the food and tuned them out very easily once I dug into the chicken. I always knew them for good waffle sandwiches, but now I'd list them out as a go-to chicken tender spot. Well buck buck to that!",

    "text": "Probably a 4.5 star review, but not 5.  Very strong lunch at Bruxie on a Friday afternoon around 1.  The line was almost out the door, but it goes pretty quickly.  I was with a group of friends, so we decided to share some items.  We went with the original sandwich, the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, the cheesy waffle fries, the mac and cheese, and the Irish nachos.  To drink, I got the strawberry lemonade.   The food took about 10 minutes to arrive.  Service is great, they bring the food out to you and were very quick to pick up clean dishes or offer refills.  Everyone was friendly as well, fantastic in that regard.  Of the sandwiches, I strongly preferred the Nashville hot chicken to the original.  The Nashville hot chicken is bade with a fried chicken thigh versus the chicken breast that the original contains.  The thigh was thicker and juicier than the breast, which wasn't dry but twas close to it.  Additionally, the sauce on the Nashville sandwich was strong.  It wasn't super hot but it had a bit of heat with it.  The sauce and shredded pickles went well with it.  This sandwich was far superior to the original.  The waffles are light, airy, with a slight crispiness to them.  The syrup was very good, thick with lots of maple flavor.  I may get just waffles with chicken strips next time rather than a sandwich, they were very good.  On the sides, the waffle fries are basic and lightly seasoned.  The cheese sauce is also pretty basic, but it's good.  The Irish nachos are large, imminently shareable.  They are LOADED with toppings:  bacon, cheese, sour cream, chives.  They were good, if not a little messy.  I preferred these to the cheesy fries.  The mac and cheese is made with bacon, and you can definitely taste the bacon.  The cheese sauce is largely cheddar-based.  It was a classic bacon and cheddar mac and cheese.  The noodles weren't overcooked as well, they retained some bite.  The strawberry lemonade is sweet, but not overly so.  You can taste both lemon and strawberries as well, all of us enjoyed it.  And, if you are so inclined you can get a shot or two added to it.  Bruxie is a nice addition for The Park, there's outdoor seating and plenty of indoor seating.  I would absolutely come back on future trips to Vegas.",

We landed in Vegas early and needed breakfast before we wandered a bit while waiting on our room to be ready. The cab driver didn't know the place, and the cab drop off was fairly far considering we had luggage, but I'm glad we stopped. I'd definitely avoid the cocktails if you want to keep your bill down a bit (a cocktail is as much as your entree!), and don't count on this holding you all day - just enough for breakfast to get you to lunch.",

I had no interest in getting their waffle sandwiches and to truly gauge it, I went with fried chicken and waffles served the way I know it with an extra over easy egg on the side and some mac and cheese. Man oh man, I was blown away by their waffle!!! Theirs had caramelized edges that I've never had anywhere and it was divine. Their fried chicken cut wasn't what I would usually order but they only had one kind, the boneless, mostly white meat cut. Seasoning was pretty good and it was fried crispy but it was a little dry. If it were a piece of dark meat, it would have been juicier. The mac and cheese wasn't anything to rave about, of course I've had and make better ones but it did complete the whole Southern \"cheat day\" Brunch I was gunning for.   That waffle was so good I wanna get myself a waffle iron just to try to recreate it! More reason to come back to Vegas for sure!",

We ordered the 'Original' and the 'Nashville Hot' 2-pc which comes with waffle.  Both tasted great, with the Nashville having some spicy kick to it.  The only reason why this place missed the 5-star mark is their waffles.  Though they were hot and crispy, they put in some kind of sugar pellets in the batter.  After the first few bites, it just became too sweet for me.  Would've been nice if they put it on top (or on the side) so it can be scraped off for those who don't want it that sweet.  All in all, Bruxie serves up some mean chicken! A must try if you're in the area.",

My friend tried the buffalo chicken, which was not as crispy and enjoyable. The sandwich is pretty heavy; you will not go hungry for a while after eating one.

We parked in the garage at New York, New York and walked down to where they call \"The Park\" area. Since we just had something with eggs, we decided to get the original chicken and waffle instead of the breakfast chicken and waffle. We ordered it as a meal with the waffle fries and orange soda.   When the employee brought out the sandwich she also brought out an extra pan for us since we were splitting it and she also had it cut in half to make it easier for us. The sandwich, oh my freaking goodness! It was amazing. The waffle wasn't too thick or too thin and it had the perfect crisp even with the slaw and sauce. It didn't get all soggy. There was a crunch in every bite. The chicken inside again, oh my freaking goodness! So flavorful and so moist. Usually chicken breast can be a little dry but this chicken breast was the best of all breast. How do they get it that moist and juicy?! I want one right now just writing about it. The waffle fries were good but could use a little bit of salt. They were just plain waffle fries but had the perfect crisp to it. The orange soda, it was delicious. It was sugar cane orange soda. I've seen a couple different places have that brand of soda. It was different but very tasty. I would definitely recommend this place. GO NOW! Well, if you're in Vegas. You won't be disappointed, I promise!",

Came here on a Saturday night and there's not that many people there. We weren't that hungry so we decided to share the Nashville chicken bruxie sandwich. Thank god we did because the serving size is huge!!  It can definitely feed two people. Unless you're very hungry, I would suggest sharing. The workers are very nice. And extra star given for the great customer service.   We got our sandwich shortly. It looked amazing. However I would give the sandwich 3 stars. For me it was very salty!  The chicken is fried to perfection. But the amount of actual meat you get is very little because the breading is very thick. The waffle is delicious. Crispy and slightly sweet to balance the salty chicken. I also loved the pickle and slaw inside it. Basically everything cut the saltiness of the chicken. I had to put a lot of syrup on it to balance the taste... Which is very unhealthy. I'm basically using a ton of sugar to cover a ton of salt. Also, it doesn't have that Nashville sweet and spicy flavor. Just salty.",

This Sin City location is very nice and spacious with some huge windows overlooking the Park Vegas, great for people-watching.  The lines were not really long when I've gone and service is quick and friendly.    What I've Had: Fried Chicken Poutine:  just yum!  Treat yo'self to this item for the combo of waffle fries, buttermilk fried chicken, cheese curds, and gravy.  It's worth the cheat.   The Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken sandwich is basically like eating buffalo wings on a waffle and if you like those, you'll like this item.  And, it's not really too spicy which I appreciate.   The Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar waffle is nice for breakfast; you can add another egg and prosciutto to make it even nicer.   Ask for the Fluffernutter from the secret menu for a sweet little treat.  I still haven't tried the Lemon Cream and Berries, but it's on my list. If you're in the area, try Bruxie out for a fast, casual, and fun meal.",

The waffle is sweet and the chicken is moist and crispy. Do much flavor in each and ever bite your taste buds will go into overload.   However, the food isn't really hot. Seems like it was sitting for a while after cooked.   The bathroom was really dirty. The sign on the back of the door wasn't updated from the previous day. This needs to be fixed.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas with the wife doing a long foodie weekend, and the only meal we ate that wasn't some kind of fancy was a lunch at Bruxie's. While it wasn't a Michelin-starred experience, I think this was the best food for the money we had all weekend.  Holy Chicken - Fried chicken on a waffle, with bacon, cheddar, sunnyside-up egg, and sriracha. Perfectly fried chicken, juicy with a crunchy crust. Bold salty flavors and a crispy waffle that just barely manages to hold it all together. Luckily, the wonderful flavors and textures of breakfast make this a sandwich that you won't put down.  Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese - Waffle sandwich with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, and goat cheese. I assume this was designed for the vegetarians, but we added a piece of fried chicken breast and made an astoundingly good sandwich. This is everything wonderful about an arugula and goat cheese salad, but with a perfect piece of fried chicken on a crispy waffle.   We didn't order any sides because these are big sandwiches, and that turned out to be the right call.  I am SO going back here next time I get the opportunity.",

I'm able to work remotely but the idea of staying in my hotel room all day just because I knew there was reliable wifi was a bit of a drag. I ventured out to Bruxie for lunch and brought my laptop along in case I found a good internet-enabled spot. Bruxie to the rescue! The restaurant is adjacent to a small park that provides free wifi (\"TheParkWiFi\"). I camped out at my table for 4 hours and the staff was nothing but lovely to me. As a server in a previous life I know that campers can be obnoxious, so I tried to keep any requests to a minimum. But a server at Bruxie went above and beyond by consistently checking in with me, bringing me endless refills, and even letting me sample some ice cream (delicious, definitely coming back for the ice cream).  Beyond that, my lunch was moan-as-you-chew good. I got The Original fried chicken and waffle sandwich and was so impressed with the juiciness of the chicken, fresh and crispiness of the waffle, and overall flavor profile. For a fast casual restaurant, Bruxie is now on my list of favorites.",

Kinda like cheese on a burger.  I tried the Holy Chicken and it was delicious.  The hint of maple with the sriracha really worked!  I wanted to try the Nashville Hot, but heard from colleagues it was on the spicy side.  I chickened out.  Next time I won't be so scared, I'm doing it.    Was it a little pricey?  Maybe.  But walk in to a Panda Express on Las Vegas Blvd and your gonna pay more than you do on Mayberry Street.  Totally worth it!",

The staff was patient with the people in front of us, which was nice. For being new, they were extremely knowledgable and kind. After ordering, the tables were self seating, but staff members would walk around and ask if everything was alright or if we needed anything. Which was great. I got the Irish nachos (super amazing) and the classic chicken and waffles (even more amazing). The chicken was good, I just wish they added more coleslaw because I barely had any in my waffle sandwich. Other than that, yum.",

I ordered the breakfast sausage sandwich and it was pretty dry. The only thing I liked about it was the sausage and the syrup which were very good.

After the second time we just said forget It and just had my son eat It because everyone at the table already got their order and was already finished. It was just a basic chicken and waffle sandwich with fries and couldn't get it right! We went around 4o'clock and the place was not even busy but it was quiet dirty. Trash bins was full to the brim. I had the original and it was too messy to eat and waffle was dry. This place is definitely not a come back place for us. There's much better place to dine!",

I ordered the chicken waffle sandwich with fries.  Im giving this 4 stars because the food was good, although the fries were heavily over salted. The staff was kind of awkward to me.   No one seemed to have real restaurant experience, as they looked to be wandering aimlessly not even looking at what trays needed to be taken or if anyone needed anything.   Then what I thought was funny was they give you number trackers so they know what numbers are sitting where so they can just drop the food off directly to you. But they were like yelling what they had on the trays trying to hope whoever ordered the food heard them and would go table to table \"did you order this?\" Lol  Would I come here again? Sure, the food is good.",

Come early, as this place starts to get lines out the door after 9am. As Gordon Ramsey would say, that's when you know a place is good. My wife got the country sausage and egg waffle sandwich, which was great as well. She said it could have used a little salt, but overall she loved it. This is a definite must to try, especially if your hungry and just lost a bunch of money on craps, roulette, or whatever else your in too. Have fun in Vegas!!",

The waffle was thin and had the perfect crisp and the fried chicken breast had such glorious crunchy breading drizzled with a honey chili sauce and topped with a slaw.  I'm dreaming of this sandwich right now.     We ordered a side of waffle fries which were not really necessary, as my dreams were already fulfilled by the sandwich.  The homemade strawberry lemonade paired well with the sandwich (I'm acting like it's fine wine).  Plus free refills.    Don't sleep on Bruxie!",

    "text": "I am not a standard chicken and waffles fan.  From where I came, chicken and waffles did not have fried chicken.  Rather, the chicken was stewed and the meat was added to the gravy made from the stew juice.  I generally avoid chicken and waffles because of that cultural divide.  I read about Bruxie when the Park was being built and I read about their menu.  It's been bookmarked for almost a year now.  Before the Cirque show at the T-Mobile Arena, I decided to give Bruxie a try.  I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the Nashville style hot chicken waffle.  The menu describes the sandwich this way--Spicy & Smoky Fried Chicken Thigh, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Lettuce, Pickles.  I also ordered an iced tea.  I was given a buzzer and told to sit anywhere I wanted.  They'd bring the food to me when it was ready.  I put the buzzer on the table and went to the area where you get napkins, cutlery, and sweetener.  One of the women brought my tea and said I could have a refill if I wanted.  Shortly after, the woman brought me the metal mini-tray with a cardboard in the bottom for liquids.  I cut the waffle in half and then proceeded to enjoy it.  The waffle was soft with just a small amount of crust.  As I was finishing the second part of the sandwich, the waffle had lost all firmness and it just melted into the food.  As long as I was here, I decided to do it all.  I ordered a dessert waffle and it was a toss up between two but I decided on the Nutella and banana.  It was a bit smaller than the sandwich waffle.  The Nutella was spread on the waffle and then sliced banana was added.  This was good.  Bruxie gives you a fast food option in the area that's different.  I enjoyed my food there.  I would recommend they turn the music down about 20 decibels.  It would have been difficult to carry on a conversation with the loudness of the music.  I might come back and try something else here.  I like the concept.",

The slaw was a great touch as it compliments it well. The least favorite part was, ironically, the waffle itself. A tad under done and lacking in flavor - maybe the spice from the chicken was overwhelming the taste of the waffle? NO!  I aslo ate half of my wife's waffle, fried egg (cooked to perfection), and sausage. Good egg and sausage flavor complimented by the waffle but again a bit underdone and tasteless. The coffee was quite good as well. The service was meh, with the creamer not being refilled and a lack of forks -- urg.....and a lack of urgency for any of the front end employees willing to rectify it.  So, in parting, good bruch, with the waffles being the weakest part of the offering, but overall still 4/5. For a place on The Strip the price wasnt bad either. It is Vegas baby....",

My husband and I came here for lunch one day because our friends kept talking about it and it had great reviews on yelp.   We parked in the garage near by and walked along the little area of shops, restaurants, and bars. I thought it was cool how clean it was and how it didn't really make me feel like I was in Vegas.   When we got to the restaurant there was no line so we were able to ask all the questions we wanted to ask. The cashier wasn't rushing us and was very friendly.   We ended up getting the chicken and waffles, chicken sandwich, and Nutella banana (suggestion of the cashier). Everything was delicious. We both loved how tender and juicy the chicken was and the Nutella didn't disappoint.   Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious. Will be coming here in the future.",

My friend and I split the sandwich (which they cut in half for us) and were full. Granted, we'd both already eaten Shake Shack burgers beforehand. Still, I think two could comfortably share an entree here.   The prices are reasonable. They have a lot of seating and were not too crowded. You gotta love the reusable cutlery.

We strolled over on our first full day for breakfast/brunch at about 11am. It was pretty full on the inside, but since it was so hot inside, we opted to sit outside instead.   Bruxie specializes in waffles - specifically waffles with chicken (although there are plenty of options without chicken as well). You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table later. I had the Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich, which features fried chicken coated in buffalo sauce and served with crisp vegetable slaw, bleu cheese crumbles, chives, and ranch dressing.   The chicken was very moist and tender on the inside and super crunchy on the outside. Surprisingly, the \"structural integrity\" (words that get thrown around when you travel with 3 engineers) of the waffle was very strong. You can hold it up and eat it like a real sandwich without it falling apart.   I enjoyed my sandwich, but it's not something that I would go out of my way to have again. The chicken was good and the waffle was good - but I think I would've liked it better separated.",

I ordered the crispy chicken waffle sandwich, Southern bbq waffle sandwich, and the original waffle sandwich. Out of the three my favorite was the southern bbq one because it had the most flavor. The chicken was decent and had some crisp to it. What made the dish delicious was bbq sauce and the crispy onion straws. The original sandwich was too bland for me and didn't have an interesting flavor profile. Crispy chicken was also good, but ironically wasn't super crispy lol. The chicken itself was dry, but I think it was more apparent since I didn't get much sauce in this sandwich.  Overall this place was decent. I think I like the location back at home because their sandwich quality is a bit more consistent and cheaper because I'm not paying tourist prices for food. If you do end up going here I'd recommend making your meal or combo or ordering 2 sandwiches if you want to be full. Their portions are not that big and eating one can leave you a bit hungry still.",

They were so satisfying and the little bit of syrup I added just topped it off! I cannot get over the fact that they were so miniature and cute, but so savory!

Oh, about the actual taste of the food. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich, pretty good, but not much chicken. It's mostly breading.  $14 for a sandwich, which it's grab and go. I'm sure they can afford another 2ozs of chicken.  There are many high ratings, but there is no way this can be a 4 star+ place. It's too basic, although the concept is solid, waffle, chicken, egg and cheese. Yum.",

    "text": "Bruxie violated two of my pet peeves and still gets 4 Stars, so you know I was pretty impressed by the food.  Pet Peeve #1- It's an order at the counter type place. These places always make me feel rushed and uncomfortable. Even though I was the first customer of the day, I felt like I was holding things up, so I just ordered an Original Chicken and Waffle Sandwich and a Belgian Mocha.  Pet Peeve #2- Why do restaurants that work so hard to get things Crispy and/or Crunchy put sauces and wet condiments directly on them? It always turns the crispiness and crunchiness to sogginess.  Now onto the food itself. The Original has Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Chili Honey and Cider Cole Slaw. The Chicken was perfectly seasoned and the parts that weren't turned soggy by the slaw had a wonderful crunch. The Waffles were the absolute lightest, crispiest, best I've ever had. Again, except for the parts that had contact with the slaw. Even the slaw itself was very good and the Chili Honey added a really nice sweet heat to the sandwich. My Mocha was the best coffee I had this Vegas trip.  Bruxie is wheelchair accessible and the food is fantastic, so I will definitely be back. I'll just order the Cole Slaw on the side!",

    "text": "Have you ever wanted epic food coma while in Vegas? Yes, you do. It IS Vegas after all.  Yes, there are buffets. Or you can come here for carb overload amazingness. There are other locations in SoCal, but this is a convenient option at The Park, where there is a variety restaurants and bars by the new stadium.  Since this is the home of the original **Chicken Waffle Sandwich**, someone had to order it. It's exactly what you're imagining, except way more massive. The waffle is super thick and the chicken has a nice crisp breading.  We also shared the **Poutine Waffle Fries.** Good lord, the portion was way huger than we expected. We thought it would be a small appetizer size. Nope. The delicious waffle fries are topped with cheese curds and pieces of fried chicken (yes, more fried chicken).   However appetizing that sounds, I enjoyed the dish Frau C. and I shared the most. The **Original Chicken & Waffle Skillet** arrived and I couldn't stop drooling. It's surprising I was even able to get a photo of it before devouring it! The chicken is breaded in a super thin crispy batter, the waffle infused with cheddar and bacon, and the whole thing completely doused in maple syrup. To die for! I literally think I died a little bit eating this.  TIP: Food coma will immediately commence, so be prepared. Maybe bring your pillow so you can take a nap! (Okay, probably not.)  DATE TIP: Nap time!",

However, it took FIFTY minutes for the food to get to our table. The table next us to us and my fiance went to check on our food multiple times-what a crazy wait once the order has been put in!   Now the food- Nashville chicken and waffle - the fiance and I split this and I'm glad we did. It tasted amazing but it was REALLY greasy, I definitely wouldn't have been able to eat the entire thing. Nutella and banana waffle. OMG I would return for this but it's not worth a 50 minute wait... Lemon cream and berries waffle-way too tart and the lemon cream was not good Strawberry lemonade- a good choice!",

Finally when the food came, my disappointment grew even further. I ordered the chicken waffle. The chicken was thin, dry, and small, and it didn't even looked fried at all, just one piece of chicken, brown on the outside (no batter) with barely any seasoning. The waffle was weirdly crunchy but had no taste at all.",

Cashier was very friendly and helpful when we asked about some of the items on the menu. Not too pricey. Now the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is as we were eating, my wife noticed the kitchen has a window on the side wall where you can pretty much peek in as see the cooks preparing the food. At first sight, the room looks clean and well organized except for 2 things. One, the cook was not wearing a hair cover or net and 2, we were surprised to see flies in the room. Yes flies. My stomach turned a bit but like I said the food is very delicious. So, if I ever go again I think I'll check the cooks room first before ordering.",

Hot but not too powerful. It was just half of a Belgian waffle and 3-4 tenders. I could've definitely ate it all myself but we didn't want too much to eat since it was late afternoon and we had dinner reservations at 7. Went for breakfast twice and had the country sausage and egg sandwich one day. Was very good. Then we went back on our last day before the airport and I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. Good size piece of chicken and very tender and moist. Prices are very reasonable for the size portions you get. Wish there were some in the Midwest!",

The problem I seen was they had an employee asking customers if they have any questions about the menu. My opinion is it's mostly Chicken and Waffles so I don't think they'll  be too many questions. But that is the problem she could be helping the girls at the register because they were going pretty slow. My party ordered two meals. One was the Nashville it seemed pretty greasy at the bottom and soaked up the cardboard waffle holder. Not sure it's supposed to be like that but it wasn't very appetizing to look at. Second meal the Carolina BBQ pulled pork I liked it but the pork was cold. We liked the waffle fries. We decided to share the side Caesar salad, it's served in a paper soup cup size. That item was the worst item that we had. the salad was a little old showing rust throughout almost every piece. The parmesan cheese that was on it, was old tough to bite into and turning colors. The dressing was not bad and they don't put croutons in that salad. All in all the waffles are tasty but but they should be that's what you're going for it's just the idiosyncrasy of the other items on their menu.",

This means I do my due diligence when it comes to where I'm going to eat, and I do a lot of menu reading and review scouting. Bruxie had some pretty solid reviews so it was on the agenda for yesterday (Saturday). Nice crowd, no wait for a table, really clean and open restaurant. I ordered the Holy Chicken. Waffle with cheddar, fried chicken, bacon, and over easy egg. I told them to hold the Sriracha. They also gave a generous pour of a thin maple syrup over the whole thing. Best ever. I loved the thin crispy waffle; it was just enough so as not to overpower everything else that was going on with the meal. The chicken itself was cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY. Waffle fries were nice and fresh, and the strawberry lemonade Palmer was very refreshing. 10/10 will always visit this place when I'm in Vegas.",

The waffle wow light toasty and crispy without being heavy. Ordered the Original chicken and waffle, that kick of honey, oh man! very pleased but I will ask for extra slaw and jalapenos if they have it from now on! My daughter had the creme brule waffle with whipped creme n strawberries, Awesome! Lemonade has that perfect balance of tart, fruity sweetnes and refillable. Everyone was very nice, helpful. A !",

Line up at the counter to order and they'll bring your food to you.  Everything was brand new.  The dining room was very casual and featured pounding dance music.  By the time I got my sandwich, the cole slaw had pretty much dripped off the chicken and on to the tray.  The syrup wasn't maple, and it had a sweet and very slight hot kick to it.  I must say that the waffle sandwich was pretty tasty.  The fries were good.  The original diet cola wasn't all that tasty.  You can also get a serving of fruit as a side and that was very tasty.    The guy working the dining room was constantly going from table to table asking if we needed anything and getting it for us.  More soda, forks, knives, napkins?  No problem.  He was constantly in motion and gave us the best service we had on this Vegas trip.",

From the moment I walked in I was kindly greeted by the employees, but they seemed more interested in their conversation talking about the tips they made in the day than in taking my order. Once I ordered and got my hamburger waffle I was disappointed with the fact that the waffle was soggy/tasteless and the fact that I got no bacon after I paid $1.50 for it. The waffle wasn't even cooked all the way and immediately broke down with the first bite I gave it. Waffles aren't supposed to easily break if they are cooked or prepared right. The only thing I cannot complain about it the delicious meat they put on this meal.  I could say that one day I'll come back and give Bruxie another chance, but I'd be lying.",

The cashier was very friendly in recommending options to us, and there are free refills on drinks! FYI STRAWBERRY LEMONADE! My boyfriend went for the Arnold palmer and had instant regrets about not getting the lemonade but you can switch them out. Food took a little bit to come, but there are constantly people checking on you and asking to refill your drinks. I was disappointed with my sandwich as I'm all for spicy (which given the name I was told it was going to be) but it was far from anything hot. Halfway through our sandwiches, the flavor for both of us got boring and bland which we ended up not finishing. The BBQ sandwich was packed with sweet BBQ flavor and I kind of wished I got that one instead. The waffle fries ended up getting hard as we finished and by the end of it we didn't even finish those either. For the price and it being in Vegas, pretty average for us. We would really come back only to try the original sandwich.",

You got the crispiness and saltiness from the bacon and the sweet flavors of lightly drizzled syrup all in one plate, nothing could be more perfect!   Also, the location is easy to find and located in a nice developing area near the T-Mobile Arena with a nice manicured public plaza and shaded outdoor seating.",

Not good for you, but scrumptious.   HOLY CHICKEN! waffle sandwich.  Maple glazed chicken, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, Sriracha sauce, Sunny-side up Egg.  It was more of knife and fork situation that a sandwich but it was bomb.  One waffle had baked on melted cheddar.  The bacon was crispy and salty.  The maple glaze on the chicken with the made the it taste like breakfast. The sunny-side up egg oozing its goodness all over errythang made this dish.    I couldn't resist the angry mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was made with a creamy bechamel cheese sauce rather than just melted cheese.  Then to add a kick they threw in bacon and buffalo hot sauce.    The atmosphere had a modern/hipster vibe going on.  They were busy but cranked through the orders.  We only had to wait 15 min tops to get our food.",

It is convenitnelty located by the CPK, Sake Rok and the famous TMobile Arena is within walking distance. It is the perfect spot to visit after a Golden Knights game. I love to come here on Wednesday's as they have $5 specials if you sign up for their email program.   I love the original chicken and waffle, I usually sub out the coleslaw but if I forget it doesn't make a big difference to the meal but I prefer not to have it.   They have some amazing waffle fries that accompany the meal nicely. If you're daring, they also have Irish nachos with is like loaded with all sorts of yummy goodness!   They have a nice selection of craft sodas and a killer strawberry lemonade. I find myself getting like 3 refills before my plate is finished.   If you're looking for a bangin' deal and a bangin' meal, I will see you here on Wednesday's!",

So this is not a quaint, quiet breakfast but by any means. But that's not a bad thing. It wakes you up! Lol! The food came out quick. The cashier was polite. I wasn't sure about cheese on my waffle or sarachi May so skipped the cheese and had the mail put on the side. I did test it with the mail and it was actually quite good with the hot and the  sweet together. My husband tried the cheese and he liked it. It's melted on, not like a slice of cheese. The chicken was crispy and very good. It was a chicken thigh. It wasn't too flavorful that it took over the entire combination of the dish. You could taste everything, the waffle, the eggs, chicken,the bacon. Oh the bacon! The bacon was thick and crispy and delicious on my sandwich, but not on my husbands, his could've been cooked longer. There is already syrup on the bottom waffle piece, so you don't need a lot of syrup watch out for that. The waffle state crispy until the very end of my breakfast. It was quite odd, because I'm used to him getting a little soggy or just not being goodbye the time you finish breakfast. These were very light and crispy. Overall I would definitely recommend this place. There was a line out the door consistently from the time we walked in. The line though, it moves pretty fast. Definitely try it if you're in Vegas. We paid about $39 For our breakfast I added a strawberry lemonade he added a coffee and an extra egg. Enjoy! (The only reasonI did not write these guys a five is because I asked for my eggs to be fried over hard and I had to send it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fback.to&s=443d2e89ea806cd7a3c868c063eac7358881c8db25ba91c7bc38c94679bd5134\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">back.to</a> If I could do 4.5 I would have)",

    "text": "Went to Bruxie for the first time last week and I'm so glad that we decided to come back for it! Initially, we went on a Thursday morning around 10:45am. The line was out the door and we were starving so we ended up settling for Shake Shack next door. Saturday morning we wanted to try again but this time we were smart and went right before it opened. They open at 9, but they started letting people in about 10-15 minutes early!! We almost had to wait in a long line again because we didn't realize they opened early!   Ambience (5/5) - I really like the sort of hipster feel to the place. They have really large windows that lets in sunlight and really brightens up the place. It's a very clean environment and I love that.   Holy chicken! (5/5) - If you're a person that likes the sweet and salty combination, I would definitely recommend this! I am very picky about chicken because a lot of places make chicken extremely dry but Bruxie's chicken is definitely not dry. It was a juicy and savory piece of chicken that was maple glazed and TASTED SO WELL TOGETHER!   Fried chicken w/ bacon cheddar waffle and maple butter (5/5) - I'm not sure if we got the original seasoned or the kickin chicken but whatever we got was amazing. Then again I am really biased because I love pairing little big of sweetness and savory.   Bruxie Burger (3/5) - Don't get it. If you're really craving a burger then go get a burger next door at shake shack or any other places that actually makes burgers. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad! It's just that Bruxie is known for their chicken.. SO GET THE CHICKEN.. promise you won't regret getting the chicken.",

I was glad they opened one in Vegas since I haven't been able to make it to the LA location. It is a little hard to find as its on the side of the hotel and not inside or on the Las Vegas blvd side. It's around the corner from shake shack.  At 10pm at night, I was stoked to see there was NO line! I ordered the original chicken and waffle and a water. And then I almost fainted at how much my total was bc my water was almost as much as my chicken and waffle!!!!!!!! It was my bad for not noticing there was a \"meal deal\" (adding a drink/side to your waffle for a couple bucks more) but I wish the girl who was ringing me up would've mentioned something. Like \"hey you wanna add a drink and a side to that for $3.95?\". Because paying $7 bucks for smart water?! I already felt like a idiot for buying it but I was thirsty from speed walking all over the strip so I just sucked it up handed over my money.   The chicken tho, was deeeeelicious. It was so freaking good. But the waffle was just ok. But the chicken. I could eat a plate of just that chicken alone! It was just perfect. Perfectly seasoned and fried, the right amount of crispness. It was just delicious. Def 5 stars for the chicken. But I had to give this place 4 stars for just the ok waffle and the Louis Vuitton priced water.   I would still go back and give this place another try, there are a lot of good looking things on the menu that look worth trying.",

    "text": "So, I had found Bruxie on Yelp before I left for Vegas & had it bookmarked. I knew I really wanted to try it. We were staying at NYNY so it was a quick 5 minute walk to get to. I loved the decor and the open air feel of the restaurant. Perfect for a lunch. Great window seats for people watching.   The service was super friendly & gave me some great suggestions for my first time. I ordered the classic Chicken & Waffle, my husband ordered a Sausage/Egg/Cheese waffle, and we ordered the Lemon Cream with Berries to share. Because, why not?!?! (also get the strawberry lemonade, it's amazing!)   My chicken and waffle was a new experience for me! It was SO GOOD. It had cabbage and a really yummy sauce on it. The berries with the lemon cream was pretty much unbelievable. Even my husband wanted to go back the next day for another one! haha!   When we were getting ready to leave they offered free refills on the lemonade so that was nice! I will definitely be back here! I want to try pretty much everything on the menu!   Great work Bruxie, you are one of my new Vegas favs!",

And the fact it had \"stuff\" inside I was not sure I wanted it.  I always try new things so why not.  So after my first bite, I don't think I tasted much more because I inhaled the rest of it.  This invention was super yummy.  And it is so wonderful to know there is a location in Los Angeles.  I need to stay away from it because I will have this more often than I need.    The lemonade was good too, and don't forget...it's Vegas so you can add a punch to your lemonade.    The service here was VERY good.  Everyone was friendly and attentive.     This place ROCKS!",

It's a casual quick-serve restaurant (where you order in line and then they bring the food to your table). The service was great and it took about 10 min for us to get our food.   We ordered the 2 pieces of fried chicken (which includes a bacon-cheddar waffle), Holy Chicken sandwich, Angry Mac & Cheese, Waffle Fries, and Strawberry Lemonade. The Bacon-Cheddar Waffle was the highlight of the meal! It had a crispy exterior with a fluffy interior. The 2 piece fried chicken (we got one of each flavor) is a MUST ORDER. The Holy Chicken sandwich was delicious too but not as good as the waffle that came with the sandwich is much thinner. We were so full from these two dishes that we should've skipped the other three side dishes. The waffle fries and the Mac & Cheese aren't particularly tasty enough to warrant special attention. The strawberry lemonade was also extremely sweet.   Overall, this place is really good! We would come back but mainly for the bacon cheddar waffle.",

This place is no joke, one of the best places to eat in Vegas that won't kill your wallet. Each item will run you about $10. The line can get long at times, but it moves very quickly. The food is brought out to you too, so grab a cup of iced water while you're waiting or try their strawberry lemonade (the best I've ever had!).  Day 1- Buttermilk Fried Chicken Cobb and I tried my girlfriend's Grilled California Pesto Chicken Day 2- Nashville Hot Chicken Day 3- Hot Pastrami and Swiss and I tried Green Eggs and Ham  All 3 days I was impressed by the food. Every item I tried was amazing, so you can't go wrng with anything. They're known for their chicken, but the breakfast waffles were good too. I'm sure the sweet waffles would be good too but I didnt get to try them. The chicken is really juicy and tender, regardless of which item you choose. The salad was fresh too. If you're visiting, definitely try out Bruxie!",

Decided to order the fried chicken w/ the bacon waffle and the holy chicken waffle sandwich.   Asked for the siracha sauce on the side and of course didn't get that. Though bf liked it.   My fried chicken and waffle was good but geez, I'm a lover of sweets ok, but damn all those sugar crystals or rocks were way toooooo much! It was like rock candy in the waffle! I picked most of it out then it was tasty! I think just the bacon in the waffle with syrup would of did the job. Chicken was good though. Just that waffle! Ughhhh! Please less sugar crack!!",

Not sure if hipster, trendy, or sustainable is the word, but the interior is similar to Skinny Fats.  Since the weather was nice, the large windows were open, and the Big Ass Fans (that is what they are called) were in motion.        You must go in line to order, and they bring the food to you.  The line was long when I went, but it went by fast.    I got the buffalo bleu fried chicken waffle sandwich with a side of waffle fries.  Also ordered the Liege waffle.  Buffalo bleu was mediocre in flavor.  The waffle fries are like Chic-Fil-A waffle fries.  The Liege waffle was my favorite:  fried on the outside, and heavy and doughy on the inside.  Top was lightly coated with powdered sugar.  So much hype because it's new and something you don't see everyday.  Good experience, but the taste was just mediocre.",

Sunday December 11th, 2016, it was about 7pm and I took a Lyft and visited this place for the first time yesterday for lunch. I was at Caesars and just heard about this place. I ordered for me and a friend and took it to go. I got the regular Chicken and Waffles, and by no means is this food 'regular'. I got chicken tenders and waffle fries for the friend. We had a field day it was so darn good and flavorful!   She had whore mean which was moist and soft and I had the dark meat. I also for the the Nutella and Banana waffle dessert treat. Boy oh boy! I'm still licking my fingers!!! The service was good and the boy at the register was suuuuuper duper helpful and really nice! I was completely confident ordering the food I did just by the way motioned and said that was great choice. I got back to work to enjoy my meal and it was everrrrrrything!!!!! My friend and I were very happy campers! Will be going back soon!",

Crispy #friedchicken with sweet slaw and a light crisp waffle for bread. The texture and flavor combinations are all there. But when you produce certain foods for mass consumption, it's way too hard to keep quality standards #high . And then it's only tasty if your high. If this dish was made to order it would have probably been #phenomenal . But you get what you pay for. I can't hate on them for fulfilling the masses.",

Hello Bruxie... the chicken from a chicken and waffle is suppose to be crispy, not soggy af and tasteless. But oh.. the waffle was super hard and dry and crunchy though...a cost of $10 a waffle is not enough for you guys to buy milk and put a sufficient amount of it into your waffle batter? Seriously... if you want better chicken and waffles.... walk down to hash house a go go, this place is NOT worth your $$, your time, nor your stomach space.",

    "text": "YUM YUM YUM!!  So bomb that I'm making this my 100th review. Shock!   I was surprised on how delicious this place was! I ordered the Original Chicken and Waffle. It was prepared like a waffle taco. Large thin, crispy, yet airy waffle that had a hint of syrup in the taste, a very large, super meaty, not overly battered chicken breast that was seasoned to perfection and had a tad of coleslaw. I got mine with waffle fries too, and that was even fresh. Simple yet satisfying.   My friend got the Nashville chicken and waffles and he fell in love once he took a bite. His had the right spices to it with super large pickles in his order. I took a bite, of course and it was deflectable! He also ordered the mac and cheese but we weren't too impressed by it. Still ate it all though!! lol.   At the end, we finished our meals with a Waffle Sundae. The waffle underneath the ice cream wasn't something to be excited about. No taste to it, sadly and it was super thick. I was hoping for some more airy, crispy waffles like what my chicken and waffle came with. That and for some reason I thought of a cinnamon waffle? Was that another option? I don't remember. The ice cream, however, was thick and creamy and you can eat it on its own. Very good!!   FYI. If you decide to order ice cream, put it on hold so your meal can come out first. The cashier didn't tell us about that so our dessert came out first. Luckily we inhaled our food and still enjoyed the not so melted ice cream we shared. the girl who took the sundae out told us we can do that. She even offered to take it back and give us a new batch, but there was no need. NOTED!   It did get stupid busy when we were there, but its because its on the strip. There was seats inside and a ton outside. Ordering was also quick and easy as a girl was standing outside giving people menu's.   ANYWAY, JUST GET HERE AND TRY IT. It's Delicious!",

The place is pretty spacious with inside and outside seatings, pretty friendly staff and decent service for a walk up and order kind of place.   The sandwiches we tried were pretty good and not very expensive for being on The Strip. We got Buffalo Blue Cheese, Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. All three were really good, the chicken was fried perfectly crispy, the lettuce and pickle cooled the tastebuds against the chili honey and the hot fried chicken.   The idea of chicken and waffle is nothing new, but the ingredients they use tasted fresh and the various options to choose from are very nice, you can get a sandwich, a salad, or sweet waffle treats. Fun place to check out!",

    "text": "We stopped in on the second day the park opened. It was on a Tuesday morning, so there was not much of a crowd. Be ready for all the construction if you go during the day. They are still constructing a theater directly across from the park.  We tried the original Chicken & Waffle sandwich and the Roasted Mushroom & Grilled Chicken Salad. Both were excellent.  You walk in and you order at a counter, as you would at any fast food establishment. Once you order you are given a pager that will vibrate when your order is ready. The server brings your food to you. The servers looked like they were having trouble finding the customers when their orders were ready. They might want to fine tune the order delivery system. I would suggest having the customers pick up their order when the pager is activated.  The salad was very good. It had roasted crimini mushrooms, grilled chicken breast, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, romaine, and arugula. The dressing was a lemon and balsamic vinaigrette.  The waffle was very light and crispy and it was folded in half with a good sized piece of fried boneless chicken breast on top of cider slaw. The chicken was seasoned well and I think I liked it with the slaw instead of with syrup. It was a nice change from the sweet syrup you usually get on chicken and waffles. Very tasty!!!  I will definitely be back if I am in the area. I recommend you stop in. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Bruxie (is that the correct spelling?) Waffle sandwiches with savory fillings aren't as appealing when you can eat a fresh Liege waffle covered in frozen custard, whipped cream, fudge, caramel, and whole roasted peanuts, so I ordered the sundae! It's a good size for sharing and at $6.95, you're unlikely to find a more satisfying dessert in The Park. This is the perfect sweet stop after watching a concert at T-Mobile arena.  There are a few similar waffle sandwich concepts already in Las Vegas, but Bruxie serves it up at a comparable price point with higher quality ingredients. I didn't feel like I was being overcharged to compensate for the Strip location. Service was engaged and excellent, starting with a young man in front of the restaurant who ran to get me a sample cup of their creamy frozen custard when I asked about the product. I also ordered a side of cheesy waffle fries and I'll stick with the specialty waffles in the future. The fries were standard but over salted. Rumors point to a secret menu and I think I'll be back for the Fluffernutter waffle!",

Their tenders had kind of a Nashville hot chicken flavor.  The waffles were fairly thin like an Eggo, but way better than an Eggo could ever be.   If you are not eating healthy and want some delicious, quick comfort food this side of the Strip, definitely check this place out!",

    "text": "Bruxie: home of the original chicken waffle sandwiches and much more (frozen custard, waffle fries & waffle nachos).  After our first trip to this place when my family and I visited Vegas last year, my family instantly knew that we wanted to come back for more. Located in The Park Plaza by New York New York and Shake Shack, Bruxie is surrounded by eateries but is the only place that holds the famous chicken waffle sandwich. The have seating available in the three black tables outside and plenty to fit large groups or a couple inside. When it gets busy, they give you trackers that can only go as far as the black tables near the entrance so be careful where you choose to sit. The service is bomb and are welcome to assist you with your needs right away (extra utensils), despite the fact they have a water station complete with sauces (syrup, ketchup, hot sauce) for your use.   We came by 2-3 times (Thurs, Fri, Sat) during our trip, which seems like we wildin a bit too much but hey! Bay Area sadly doesn't have a Bruxie so gotta take the chance ): Although we mostly came back for their delicious frozen custard, we also got their original chicken waffle sandwich and chicken tenders with their signature waffle fries.   Their waffle fries are lightly fried yet still remain to maintain that crispness you desire in a regular fry. Their servings are pretty huge so sharing is definitely recommended if you're ordering a waffle sandwich. The original chicken waffle sandwich includes a crunchy honey glazed chicken, a thin/soft yet crispy on the edges waffle, and cole slaw. You can make it a combo with their waffle fries for extra couple bucks more if you're feeling it. Their chicken tenders were large and seemed a bit too overly fried, but that's what gave it its crunchy appearance and taste. Most importantly, the chicken tenders weren't dry! For dessert, we chose their Wisconsin Frozen Custard which is beyond amazeballs. Their frozen custard has the option to be served in a waffle cone or a regular cup (which is actually a whole lot, don't underestimate the size since they fill it to the top). It's definitely mouthwatering and heavenly. I'm disappointed that the bay hasn't matched up to this greatness yet :/   Bruxie is absolutely worth the hype of chicken waffle sandwiches. With a open & clean atmosphere, I'd come back again (:",

Particularly, we stopped by at about 8pm on Saturday, April 15th.  Overall, this place gets 5 stars; however, I would recommend when there are more than a few people in line it would be awesome if you could take orders from both stations.   Anyway, we were the fourth in line and had to wait about 7 minutes to place our order.  We don't mind waiting for the food at the table; however, it would have been nice to place the order just a bit faster.  We both had a sandwich.  I had the buffalo chicken waffle sandwich and the other person in our party had the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.  We also shared an order of the Irish Nachos/Fries.    Everything we had was cooked perfectly and it just had so many amazing flavor profiles.  Man oh man  -- if this wasn't so bad for you -- I would eat it nearly everyday.  The waffle was perfect and fluffy and the chicken was tender, cooked to perfection and so delicious.    The fries were equally as good.    I cannot wait to come back to Bruxie's again!!",

My husband ordered the B.A.M.F and I the holy chicken. Both were good and Instagram worthy. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The waffles were crunchy and fluffy the way they should be. And the flavors balanced well on both sandwiches. I do recommend the B.A.M.F more of the two waffle sandwiches.  We also ordered the fried pickles. Try these! They have a lot of flavor and are sliced thickly.  The only thing I didn't like was the strawberry lemonade. It was waaaaaaay too sweet. Once I added water to it I could rock with it.  Service was great there were about 10 people working but one lady stood out. She outworked everyone. She was taking orders, refilling drinks, filling the water, cleaning tables and delivering food.  The only thing she didn't do was cook.",

The waffles for the sandwiches were kind of plain but the chicken itself was phenomenal. We had the Southern BBQ and the Nashiville Hot. Both were good in their own right and I honestly couldn't pick a favorite. The in-laws shared some chicken strips with waffles that rivaled a pretty damn fine dessert. I honestly wished my waffle in the waffle sandwich was a little sweeter, but they were still good nonetheless.   All in all, totally worth the a hour we spent walking though I do wish the items I saw photographed on Yelp were on the menu. Oh well, I guess.",

When I was ordering, I asked for extra sauce but was told that I was already too spicy and should stay away.

Ordered the 2 piece original with waffle and it was soooo good. Nice lil kick to the chicken.   Definitely a good place to eat for a quick bite and chill. The outside has good seating and games for adults and kids to play.",

My SO and I had chicken and mushroom waffles set (came with waffles fries) and we really like them. Though the waffles were not mind-blowing delicious, they made quite a tasty and satisfying breakfast for us. My mushroom waffles weren't too heavy and I still felt refreshed and not sluggish after eating all that carb.  P.S. they may seem to have a line out the door sometimes...but the place is big enough that people would finish their meals and you can probably find your own place to sit while waiting in line or for your order.",

I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich that had lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and sauce, which was nice bc it wasn't too heavy. My friend got the chicken fingers w/ waffle fries which were pretty bomb.   We went for dinner before a show at Park Theatre so it's convenient if you're going there or the AT&T stadium. Service was solid and the food came out quickly but it didn't seem too busy when we went. It worked out though bc we didn't have much time. One highlight - you can add booze to your lemonade or other soft drink for $5 and they were pretty strong! I'd definitely come back if I'm craving chicken & waffles.",

Everything blended well and I added maple syrup on it which was definitely a must. The mac and cheese was under-whelming. Cheese was not creamy and very loose. Took 2 bites and it was enough for me to be like - it's not worth the calories. Their Bloody Mary was not good either. I liked the bacon in it but other than that it wasn't that great. Would pass on this as well. I am giving it a 5 star because the main dish was delicious! Stop in and get that - only that. My friend got the chicken and waffles and she loved it! Chicken seasoned very well. So if you like chicken and waffles only this could be a good option. Enjoy!",

    "text": "It was a hangover Tuesday for us and we were ready for some brunch. A quick search resulted in Bruxie which offered chicken & waffles which got us instantly excited. Now, I know that chicken and waffles isn't a new concept anymore. It got really big about 5 years ago and now almost every other restaurant offers this option. However, if done right, a meal of chicken & waffles can hit the ball out of the park when it comes to recovering from a very late night in Vegas.   Here are my ratings based on different criteria:  Quality of food: Really good. We split an order of the original Chicken & Waffles, a side of waffle fries, and a strawberry lemonade. The original comes with Seasoned Breast, Chili Honey, all topped with Cider Slaw. The waffles are thin but go really well with the thick pieces of juicy crispy chicken breast. The syrup on the waffles was done just right and wasn't overly sweet. The waffle fries were very crispy. I recommend getting a side of the Bruxie sauce and dipping your waffle fries in them. The strawberry lemonade was on the tart side which I did not like.  Decor: Bright and Trendy! They have huge LED TVs with menus on them. The thing that I liked about the TVs was that the menu stayed on constantly instead of changing screens while you're trying to read the menu...don't you just hate that?!? One thing that I wish they had was a story on how Bruxie got started.  Cleanliness: No complaints. The tables, floor, and bathrooms were clean.  Service: Both the cashier and the person that brought us food to our table did it with a smile. However, they really blew it when it comes to forgetting part of our order. We had ordered a side of waffle fries and after the server acknowledged that she forgot them, it took her a solid 10 minutes to bring us just the fries. She kept bringing and filling other people's orders but I had to walk over and remind her again about the fries.  Speed of food preparation: Fast...except when it comes to bringing something they forgot. Like I said above, they need to figure out how to be fast on bringing something they missed in the original order.  Price: Expensive. We paid $12 for just one order of Waffle & Fries which seemed a little steep. A side of fries was $4. The quality is pretty good but the price can be a little bit lower.  I recommend Bruxie for some really tasty Chicken & Waffles.",

UGH I miss this place.    We found Bruxie by accident in Vegas since we were trying to avoid the rush of people leaving their TVs as the superbowl was coming to an end.  They were totally quiet so we got a spicy chicken sandwich to share.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  I should NEVER have shared this sandwich.  IT was SOOOO good, but we had eaten so much junk earlier while watching the game I couldn't justify ordering another sandwich.    So.... with that many places to eat, we went back a couple of days later to have lunch at Bruxie.  I orderd the crispy chicken waffle sandwich and hubby had the spicy chicken sandwich again.  I even ordered some Irish nachos which he had never heard of before.  Can I say?  NOM, NOM, NOM!   SO yummy and tasty.  I would have gone there again had I had the chance but my wasteline is thanking me  for not doing so.  TRY IT OUT!!! Definitely well priced for such a tasty meal in Vegas.",

I read a lot of positive reviews but I'm picky about chicken and waffles so I wasn't a believer until I tried it for myself. I ordered the holy chicken waffle sandwich and instantly fell in love. The chicken was crispy, the waffle was fluffy, the fried egg was runny, and the sriracha sauce added the perfect kick. Dip it all in syrup and you have your hands full of messy, blissful deliciousness. Or you can opt for the fork method but that's just not as fun! This breakfast easily makes my top 10 best breakfasts ever list. I'm happy to be heading home from the west coast, but so, so sad to be thousands of miles away from Bruxie.",

At first I was going to try the pizza place across from the park I think it's called California kitchen but I decided to walk down a little bit further and saw this place. I am so glad that I walked in and gave it a try. I had the two piece chicken with the regular waffle. When I say it was amazing I am not kidding it was just that. The chicken was seasoned, crispy, and hot. The waffle was perfect and the sauce gave it just that extra kick I was looking for. If you are looking for a place to get some great food and some good service this is the place!!!",

    "text": "First time here, not disappointed but not satisfied as well. Location is good. Took my family here (2 small kids) location wise it's Kid friendly but the menu is not that kid friendly at all. I ordered Mac and cheese for my kids and OMG it was so spicy that I could not even eat it myself. If u like spicy then order this but it doesn't go well with the bacon and flavor of the sauce. Chicken Caesar salad, looks good but taste bad. My husband said there's a fishy taste in it and it's True, dnt know why! The original Chicken waffles was ok. Again not kid friendly, the chicken was spicy and the waffles are thin that the veggies inside it and the chicken soaked the waffles so after 3 mins not crispy soft crunchy waffles ur gonna eat but a saggy one.. The chicken taste better than the rest but it's still a little spicy and kinda sweet.. I'm not a fan of spicy food and so r my kids... The waffles the looked good on their menu pics is totally different and like I said its saggy and soaked after few minutes.. My husbands ordered the Caroline pulled pork waffles, same thing, spicy and it was messy to eat so be prepared. It was a little dry too. It didn't go very well with the thin soaked waffles again. Anyways, maybe that's their theme, spicy food but I wish I was told that when I was orderin or at least ask me what level of spiciness I want! Especially the saw my kids Coz the place was kinda empty when we got there. So they have all the time to explain their menu. And it wasn't included in their menu description as well. So there u go! Decide. I mean if u like spicy and ur kids like spicy too then go for it but then again I should be informed of what ur eating or the level Of it before confirming the order. Their strawberry Palmer drink was also not good.. It taste plain. And  old... I drank my water in my hydroflask!! Kids didn't like it either, almost no flavoring! No wonder it's free refill!! So for 4 items plus 2 drinks  we paid 52$ including tax and tip... Is it worth it? Not really Coz my kids didn't get to eat. I ended up taking them to eat real kids Mac and cheese at CPK after ... So much better food  will I go back there on the future? Prob not.. Thank you!",

Their soda is homemade and you can tell it's made with real cane sugar very tasty. As a local I wish there was another one besides on the strip which I try to avoid but came on a slow Monday evening so it wasn't too bad. Price was a bit steep but I knew I'd be paying tourist price and it was good so can't complain too much about that.",

We were both super happy with our meals! The waffles aren't your dense hearty variety of waffle- they're more light, airy, and crispy- perfect for us since we were hitting a day club later that day and needed to be bikini ready! The flavors on my waffle were rich and savory, and the chicken sandwich had nice crispy chicken and came with a yummy honey sauce that tied the whole thing together! After we ate those, we ended up splitting the Nutella banana waffle to end with something sweet. I didn't expect it to be anything too special, but it was awesome! In addition to the fresh banana, there's a banana custard that's sandwiched with the Nutella as well. Not only was the food great, but the price was right, since we ended up paying $30 for all of our food! Overall, great food and great value, and we'lol definitely be back!",

I had also order a \"Freshly squeezed\"  orange juice that they forgot to bring me. I went to the cashier to ask for it the lady at the cashier stared at me for a few minutes until I asked about my juice.  After a few minutes I see my orange juice sitting on the bar for about five minutes until I decided to ask again if some one wanted to hand me my juice.   At the end the juice was not worth the time.

They were not only chicken and waffles, they were sandwiches. Totally got me. And for good reason. I got the holy chicken, and when you bite into it, the name makes all the more sense. It's the perfect combination of sweet and savory in every single bite. I also got waffle fries and a strawberry lemonade and everything just seemed to pair so well. I was in waffle chicken heaven. As for service and crowd, I went at a fairly quiet time, around 2 or 3. It's more towards the beginning of the strip so you don't get that crazy crowd. GO TREAT YOURSELF!",

This place sits out front of the T Mobile arena and the New York New York. Kind of difficult to decide where to park. You can pay the $7 at NYNY, the $5 at Monte Carlo, or head over to the Tropicana for free, but walk for a while. We opted for NYNY.  I assumed this was a sit down place. Sort of. You stand in line to order what you want, then they bring it over to you. We went about 11am, and the lunch rush was going on. The line was out the door. We did manage to snag two tables next to each other though. We had 6 people.   The food is a little pricey for what you get. I ordered the Naked Waffles, with cinnamon sugar. It's literally 2 waffles, butter, cinnamon, and syrup. Yep, naked lol.  My husband and son both ordered the Holy Moly sandwich. My husband said his was really good. My son said the siracha flavor was a little over powering. My daughter (bday girl) was a little sad. She wanted the blue cheese sandwich,  which they no longer serve. She got the bbq instead. Hers was alright. We got two orders of Irish nachos, and a fingers kids meal. The Irish nachos were yum! They also brew their own soda, which is really original. 3 of us has the spiced cola. My daughter had strawberry lemonade, spiked with vodka.   Waffles, 3 sandwiches, a kids meal, fries, and drinks came out to almost $90. Yowza!   I definitely want to go back to order a chicken sandwich. I'm a ding dong and thought naked meant not breaded, so I want to go back to get something with chicken. I ma",

I ordered mine with all the extras (avocado, bacon, fried egg). The burger was cooked to a medium rare And it was not a greasy mess like the aforementioned neighboring burger joint. My son had the tenders and tots which were awesome and came with some great sauces, good for dripping on your burger. Food came out super quick and gets dropped at your table. Good for kids, and reasonably priced for Vegas strip. I'm coming back to try the chix and waffles because if the burger is that good, gotta try the main event next.",

Overall had a good experience, but it is quite pricey though as we spent $35 dollars on just a salad, nacho fries and their special chicken sandwich.  It does get busy during lunch as we waited 20 minutes for our food.  The chicken was not too dry and crispy considering for white meat.  But if you prefer dark meat, I am not so sure if this place offers it or not.  The salad was good as you got a lot of salad though and enough chicken with bacon and avocado.  Oh yes, I love the nacho queso cheese it was quite good too and very filling. I would go back again.",

(I'm kinda into fitness and trying to watch what I eat) I really like their sweet custard sauce 3. Fried pickles: hmmmm, not a great idea. I only like pickles inside.  4. Root beer: we got it in a weird and funny way because I said \"for here\" and the waiter thought I said \"root beer\". I usually do not order drinks and just drink water. I will probably try their milkshake.   5. Bacon & cheese waffle: I like this one. This is a sweet waffle buried with bacon and cheese in it.",

    "text": "As a California native and a long-time regular at both the original Bruxie in Orange and Bruxie in Irvine, I've come to be familiar with their food, because honestly, it's quite good. But as Ellen L. mentioned yesterday, this location seems to be lacking the consistency that the California Bruxie's have.   A nearby restaurant had a considerably long line, so we decided to eat at Bruxie, having noticed earlier that there was no line at this location. The ambiance of the restaurant is much like the other locations, and that is important in capturing the essence of the original location, which was and is a small shack on an intersection in Orange. I decided to order the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar; something I've come to love and is one of my two favorite waffles at Bruxie. In addition to that, I ordered the seasonal Eggnog Shake, just for kicks. The whole ordering process was pretty smooth, except I was expecting them to ask whether I wanted the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar with a light spread of mayo but she didn't ask.   The food came out quickly; drinks first, followed by all of the entrees shortly thereafter. When I bit into the BEC, it didn't taste right and seemed to be missing a bit of flavor. It didn't take me long to realize they didn't put mayo in it. Now this was easily remedied by asking for some mayo from the staff and it did taste good afterwards, but the issue again comes down to consistency.   I have been, am, and will be a fan of Bruxie, but I think this location needs to step it up. Overall, the staff was nice and the food for the most part was good; if not for a seemingly regular pattern of mistakes and oversights, I'd definitely be comfortable with a 4 star review.",

Located near New York New York, if you are staying in the middle of the strip it's a little bit of a walk, but it truly is worth it.   It's a walk up and order place, and then they bring you your food when it's ready. There is a lot of seating inside but they also have outside tables everywhere, which is really nice when it's a beautiful day.   I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich. It, of course, came on a waffle and there was plenty of melted cheese on it, but what really made this so delicious , was the bacon ! I Love bacon and I find it very hard to get really good bacon out at restaurants and this bacon I could not get enough of. I was so happy with the sandwich choice, I wasn't sure if i was going to be sad not getting one with chicken , but it was delicious  and I was so full at the end. Will definitely order again.  My boyfriend got the Holy Chicken which looked just gorgeous.  It was a waffle with friend chicken and an over easy egg on top! Also is topped off with some type of spicy sauce. We made it a combo and it comes with a drink and waffle fries, which were tasty also. He loved his chicken and waffles !  Little detail that I love at this place is they have pitchers of ice water sitting out (where the napkins and utensils are). So you are able to get as much water as you need, which I appreciate this so much.   I have already told people about this great breakfast place, and we certainly will be back whenever we visit Vegas again !",

I ordered the latter with waffles...the fluffy belgian one (or half of one) with pieces of bacon in it. I liked the kick of the chicken and it was crispy yet not dry. The thigh was actually quite juicy. I'm not a syrup person, but the syrup was light so i even enjoyed that. Bonus, had a nice piece of bacon in my waffle to chew on.   The bf had the chicken waffle sandwich with the original chicken flavor. The waffle was a thinner (think Eggo but larger) crispy waffle. He liked it. After taking a bite of his, i decided i like my choice better though.",

But being hungry sometime between 11 and noon, and craving brunch during the week, we settled for the next best thing.   Side note thought - why doesn't Vegas have brunch every day, it's not like anyone can tell the difference between weekday and weekend when over indulging in Vegas. But I digress...   This place was busy AF, but the lines moved fast. They couldn't refill the silverware fast enough. Ordered the Holy Chicken and it was amazing! Just the right level of heat. The chicken was crispy and juicy. And the waffle was great. Then with the runny yolk (I love runny yolks!) every bite was just about perfect. Couldn't finish it, it was huge. Didn't order sides because we didn't need one, but next time I might split one sandwich and a side of fried pickles.   Too many people left messy tables, which annoyed me - and they were so busy they were left that way until the next people who wanted that table did it for them. Don't be an ass - it's pretty easy to tell you're in a place where you bus your table yourself. The garbage cans with a place to put the tray is a huge give away.   It was great, we'll be back, but will try to avoid peak times.",

We walked by and our gluttony kicked in. We rubbed our eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. Could it be True? A chicken and waffle sandwich? We decided we had to at least try! We decided to split the B.A.M.F. which is fried chicken, bacon, mac and cheese, pepporcinis with buffalo sauce on a fresh waffle. I think whoever came up with this had probably just left a dispensary! Well... it seemed like a good idea in theory but the flavors just weren't balanced. It was salt in salt on salt. The reason why chicken and waffles are generally so tasty is because of that sweet savory contrast. The pepporcinis gave a little punch of acidity but just not enough to cut through all that salty richness. Perhaps we just didn't order well. I would try it again and order something different if the occasion arises out of convenience but I won't specifically try to seek it out again soon.",

I visited on a weekday, so there wasn't really a line, but in reviews I've read, it looks like the wait can get pretty long on the weekends. I decided to get the original, which was a waffle sandwich with chicken and coleslaw. The waffle is unreal. It's light, airy, buttery, and sweet all at the same time. I really liked that the waffle part was light, because the middle is dense. The chicken was a little spicy, with a hint of sweet, and was perfectly balanced with the waffle and the coleslaw. I ate every single bit of this sandwich, and if I lived in Vegas, I would visit more often.   Definitely recommend if you haven't yet had a waffle sandwich or have a craving for chicken and waffles!",

They're chicken is so well fried. It's incredibly crispy and one piece has A LOT of meat in it. The waffles are just as amazing. They're crunchy in just the right places, and soft in the others. The combinations of these two ingredients are so well thought of with all of the items on their menu, there isn't one that will leave you with regret. I also tried a sweet waffle this time and it was just as good as I thought it would be. We tried the creme brulee waffle and the whole things just melts in your mouth. As for their signature chicken and waffle combos, it has the perfect balance between sweet and savory.   I HIGHLY recommend eating here at least once during your time at Vegas, cause you will never regret it and it's so worth the price!! I for sure will crave this place until my next visit!",

They were very busy as there was a hockey game at T-Mobile arena that evening.",

My friends and I were on a mission to acquire a solid base for an active day in Vegas, and were pleased after hitting a couple of recommended places that had super long waits to stumble upon Bruxie!  Although it by no means is a 5 star elite dining experience, they've got all your needs for an efficiency and well made brunch. They've got all sorts of amazing chicken and waffle sandwiches, as well as other breakfast and lunch sandwich options. Additionally they've got house made sodas available,  a range of coffee, and reasonably priced breakfast drinks as well.   Would I go out of my way to come back? Not necessarily. Would I be excited to eat another chicken and waffle sandwich from here if I happened to end up near a Bruxie again? Absolutely. Good service, friendly people, quick and delicious food for a good price, you can't beat it!",

I was impressed to see the different ways you can have your chicken made to go with your waffle ranging from the mildly spicy \"Original\" with chilly honey to \"Kickin chicken\" which is pretty spicy! We tried both and they were both amazing! Also they make their waffles thin so they're almost like bread is to a sandwich! Easier to eat and equally delicious.   The buffalo Mac and cheese here is served on a skillet and is soooo good! Also, they were great about holding the bacon on it for us.  Service is great! It has more of a fast food type of vibe, but significantly better quality!   I'll be returning when I'm in town next with family or friends!",

I ordered the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich and made it a combo that came with waffle fries and a soda. My boyfriend ordered the bacon, cheddar, & egg breakfast sandwich. In addition, we ordered a small side of angry mac & cheese. We didn't wait long for our food because everything came out fast. As for the food, it was good but not great. My boyfriend wasn't too fond of his breakfast waffle sandwich. The waffle on both our sandwiches were thin and soft. We both felt that the waffle could have been a lot crispier. The fried chicken on the original and the angry mac and cheese were the best part in my opinion.  Overall, the food is good but a bit on the pricey end for what we ordered. I guess it's expected since this place is located on the strip. If we're in the area again, we'll be sure to come back and try the other stuff on the menu. Oh by the way, if you sign up to be a member, you get a free soda.",

    "text": "Living in SoCal for the past 4 years, there was always a Bruxie not that far away but my NorCal friends don't have that luxury so they really wanted to check this spot out while in Vegas.   I ordered the Naked Waffle which comes as 2 rectangles instead of the 2 half circles like the waffle sandwiches. The Naked Waffle also seems like it is lighter and fluffier than the other waffles (it kind of flaked apart when I cut into it) which makes sense since the sandwich waffles need to be sturdier to hold the contents of each sandwich. Bruxie does have your typical diner maple syrup on tap for customers to get BUT the Naked Waffles comes with a cute little bottle of 100% Pure Maple Syrup (SO MUCH BETTER). I also ordered a side of fruit (sliced bananas and strawberries) which was pretty expensive but worth it because I like my waffles topped with fresh fruit.   If you've never had a waffle sandwich before I would definitely recommend checking it out. All of my friends loved what they ordered. I would say everything is pretty filling. Service was quick too!",

They have perfected the hybrid of chicken and waffles, serving a variety of chicken and waffle sandwiches, fried chicken, fries, and even mac and cheese.  What I most appreciated on the 110 degree weather day we went,  was the huge container of ice cold water at the condiments station. The line was short and there was plenty of seating both inside and outside.  This is a must-try place if you like creative food on a budget.  Perfect food to soak up all the Vegas libations and get you ready for round 2!   I would have given 5 stars, but the two girls at the counter were too busy talking to each other, we had to ask them if they were ready for us to order.  Then of course they seemed annoyed that we would even ask such a question.   Crispy Chicken $11.95 - Double fried chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and Bruxie sauce in a waffle.  Ask for a side of their ranch, it is real good!  Irish Nachos - Fries, Bruxie Cheese Sauce, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sour Cream, Chives  Mac and Cheese - Buffalo-Spiced Cheese Sauce, Bacon",

Bruxie has upped their game, and that is a good thing.  This location in on the side of New York, New York.  Nice location in a little garden court area.  There is seating inside, on an enclosed patio, and outside.  Eat in or take it to go - you are covered.  It is a walk up and order type place.  You get a pager thing and find a table; then, your food finds you.  We ordered the Holy Chicken - chicken, egg, cheese, bacon, sriracha sauce, and syrup on a waffle.  Both my son and I enjoyed the food.  There was just the right mix of salty, sweet, and hot.  We both had some customization - I chose an over medium egg instead of sunny side up, and my son skipped the sriracha sauce.  The customization was not a problem.  Two small complaints.  First, there were no forks.  The syrup makes the waffle kind of soggy, so a fork would have been nice.  Second, the price is still a bit high for what you get, but I understand this is Vegas and food is expensive.  I would come back to this location, and I might even give the original another shot.",

    "text": "Wow, I was in Vegas for only 5 days, and yet I literally ate at Bruxie's THREE TIMES! I almost bought a t-shirt as a souvenir since this was the site I was sightseeing the most at.  Their classic chicken & waffle is seriously the BEST chicken & waffles I've ever had. The chicken is crispy and drenched in this delicious sweet and spicy CHILI HONEY SAUCE. The waffle is SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY and yet slightly crisp on the edge. MAN, is it the best waffle I've ever had!  Then I had the CREME BRULEE waffle. MY GOD. As if the waffle wasn't already a perfect dessert on its own. NOW there's bruleed creme on it! *drools thinking about it*  Seriously, these waffles are perfect at any time of day, whether you are waking up early (for some reason) in Vegas or looking for a delicious late-night pick-me-up.   Their liege waffle, btw, is a completely different texture - this is a denser, Belgian waffle with sugar chunks cooked in.",

I got the holy chicken sandwich, which has fried chicken, bacon, and a sunnyside up egg along with siracha mayo. First of all, the waffles are so good. They're light, crispy, and have just enough sweetness. The chicken is amazingly juicy and tender, and has great flavor and crunch. The sandwich as a whole was a great combination of flavors. It also felt like a really good value. The service was quick also. Would definitely recommend this place and plan on returning!",

I love sweet and savory combos so I loved the chili honey that the chicken was marinated in. The waffle itself was nice and crunchy and didn't get soggy at all. NOMZ.  BUT the irish nachos and chicken tenders were OK. The waffle cut fries that were in the Irish Nachos were delish but the cheese sauce, along with the sour cream, tasted heavy after a while. Also, the batter of the chicken tenders was kinda thicc and crunchy. Was expecting it to be more soft and juicy.  But will def come back to try the rest of their waffle sandwiches!!",

Def worth the trip!",

Only downfall was that I ordered the original chicken and waffles and my waffle was soggy like it was old and it wasn't too hot. I mean I it still tasted good I just was a little disappointed that it wasn't as fresh as back home was and how I'm used to Bruxie. Everyone that worked there though we're super friendly!",

There was only one guy there that seemed like he was in a good mood, he was passing out little samples of their frozen custard. Wish I had gotten his name, but Bruxie needs to hire 10 more of him.",

The waffles are much softer and compliments the chicken very well. It's not too pricey and it's for sure worth trying since its on the strip. It's next to New York New York right in front of the T-Mobile arena. Try it! Oh.. And the strawberry lemonade is pretty good as well.",

Bruxie is located near New York New York with an ample amount of indoor/outdoor seating. The environment was very lively with some live music outside while we were there. It's fast food style ordering, so you just order at the register and seat yourselves.   This place has a creative take on chicken and waffles....making it into a sandwich! We tried the holy chicken (maple glazed chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese, sriracha sauce, sunny side up egg) and the B.A.M.F. (Fried chicken, angry mac & cheese, cheddar, pepperoncini, and angry cheese sauce). Both were so delicious!!!! The waffle was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The chicken was crunchy and juicy. The different elements and flavors of both sandwiches worked really well together. We didn't get any sides, but we were so full with just the sandwiches - the portions are huge.  I also ordered a root beer float, which finished the meal off quite well.  Really missing this chicken and waffle sandwich now that vacation is over. I wish they would bring a Bruxie to Philly!",

It was baaaaaad, waffle was dry, chicken was typically salt & pepper and syrup was just a common brand.  We've been seeing Bruxie since the last time we went here on Vegas and i must say, it's always crowded though Hubby and I didn't try to dine here 'coz of the experience I had back home.  So here we are again in Vegas looking for some good brunch to go to and boom! I thought of Bruxie   Checked their Yelp reviews, read the tips, seen their food pics and here we are!!! In Love with Chicken and waffle haha!   We have the 2pc fried chicken with original seasoning (waffle that comes with it has bacon and cheese flavor) and chicken had a syrup in it. So prepare for some energy boost kind of food!  Husband had the HOLY CHICKEN waffle with egg in it and he swore he liked it. His co worker been asking him to try chicken and waffles but he can't really imagine the taste lol Now he's eating and nodding at the same time, like agreeing that ooooh yeeeesssss you'reeeeee gooooood   For drinks he had the chocolate shake and it's milky chocolate sure thing you'll love this! and then since I'm a coffee lover, I've tried the Belgian Mocha which was new to me! It's not your typical arabic coffee, this is amazing! It's a coffee with a hint of chocolate in it.  So hubby and I are fully pledged Bruxie fan from now on!",

The Kickin' Chicken waffle sandwich with a side of waffle fries is my favorite thing to order here. However, on my latest visit to this Bruxie on the Strip, I had to order the roasted mushroom & grilled chicken salad due to some dietary restrictions. I typically would not order such a dish at a waffle sandwich establishment, but the salad tasted delicious! It is usually difficult to make healthier options just as appealing as the main attractions, but I would definitely come back to eat the salad alone. My friend ordered the B.A.M.F, and she really enjoyed her sandwich as well. The service was also attentive, and the employees cleaned up my table as soon as my friends and I finished eating. I hope Bruxie continues to open more locations in other cities because that would be awesome!",

Perhaps a little expensive, but the price did not feel unfair given the quality and taking in to account the strip location. I parked at Park MGM which I don't recommend - NYNY probably a quicker walk...I probably wouldn't have visited had I had to pay for parking unless I was staying on the strip nearby.",

I know I know, but yes the salad was so good. It had enough lettuce, perfect amount of yummy crispy chicken and all the other toppings on it, made for it a yummy salad. It was close to a Cobb salad, with the eggs, bacon, avocado and more.. soo good. We might do breakfast there tomorrow, we really want to try the waffles..  Update: I went back for breakfast and had the bacon, egg and cheese waffle. The egg was cooked to absolute perfection. It was sooo yummy. I actually can't wait to come back to Vegas to eat here again!!",

The sandwich does not come with fries so that's an additional cost.  I tried the tito's strawberry lemonade  and the next time I got the plain strawberry lemonade. The strawberry lemonade  is pretty darn sweet.    They bring the food to you and offer free refills. I saw everyone leave there plates on the table and someone would clean it.

    "text": "We had holiday visitors we were taking to a Vegas Golden Knights game and decided to have a pre-game lunch here. The chicken and waffles concept is being overdone to death, but Bruxie has decent enough offerings. The prices are very high for what you get, and the menu is limited, but it's an a-ok place to get a hearty meal, especially before a hockey game.  The line was long but moved fast. The thing to get here are the chicken and waffles. Note that the online menu isn't accurate, the actual menu in the restaurant is more limited.  We all opted for the chicken and waffles and the loaded waffle fries.  The waffles were freshly made but mostly a disappointment. They were thin and flat and had no flavor. I don't like syrup so if you drown it with the sweet stuff it may taste better.   I prefer the fat, fluffy variety of waffle, the kind where you can enjoy the crispy crunch then dive into an airy interior. These waffles were so thin that they looked a lot like frozen Eggos.   The chicken was juicy and well-seasoned, but be warned that you are NOT served a white meat breast with the chicken and waffles. I was disappointed that I had a dark meat thigh pounded thin to resemble a breast. Not cool.  Seating is extremely limited but there are a few stools out front and high top tables with space heaters in the ceiling. Always grab a seat outside so you can catch the wave of fans and all the action before a hockey game.",

Although the serving size may SEEM small, it's really not. It's super fulfilling. The waffles were super crispy and tasty. The fried chicken was flavorful and crispy as well. I didn't think it was greasy at all. They have a station of spicy ketchup, ketchup, and syrup. I drizzled more syrup and it was super delicious. One of my friends got the OG one, and the way they fry the chickens are different. The OG one has a separate jar of syrup which was tastier than the one at the station.  Although the line was long, it went by pretty fast. There are a lot of tables inside too and it was easy to find one for groups and such. The restaurant staff were super friendly and they usually bring your dishes to the table even though it's a buzzer system. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It's cheaper than most brunch places in Vegas and probably tastier. Yum yum!",

    "text": "We rarely venture out towards the super southern part of the Strip. Most of our activities and eats have been focused towards the center in the Caesars area (and we're also usually just lazy af and don't want to make the trip in the heat). But when someone told me about Bruxie and how they not only have chicken and waffles but chicken and waffle SANDWICHES... sold.  We popped in, and I was surprised to see that it was set up more like a fast food place rather than a sit-down restaurant. (I don't know why in my head I thought it would be a sit-down restaurant, but I did.) We asked the cashier for recommendations, and she said the Holy Chicken and Southern BBQ, so we were like aight, let's do it.  Holy Chicken. This is like brunch in a sandwich. You get a sunny-side up egg, bacon, fried chicken, and the perfect drizzle of sriracha for a kick smooshed between two waffles. If you're a person who loves brunchin' it out in Vegas, get this.  Southern BBQ. If any part of you loves BBQ, this is the one for you. The core of this is the double-dipped fried chicken which makes an incredible crunchy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside piece of meat. Top it off with some slaw, crispy onion straws, and BBQ sauce, and you are good to go.  Drinks. We got the strawberry lemonade not knowing it was free refills for any of their drinks. Whaaaaattttt!! You can bet our thirsty butts guzzled down cups of that lemonade before going back out into the hot Vegas desert. I'd recommend the strawberry \"palmer\", which you could probably guess is just like a regular Arnold Palmer but with strawberry lemonade instead of regular lemonade.",

You order at the counter, then find a seat and they bring it to you. While you are in line, the kitchen window sits to the right of you and the expediter has to dodge the line of people with trays full of food to deliver. Sodas are house made, juices fresh squeezed. Anyway, we decided to share a 3 piece fried chicken and original chili honey drizzle bacon cheddar waffles, Irish nachos, fresh OJ and a beer (for a real fancy beermosa). The Waffle is out of this world!!! Full of flavor and totally satisfying. The chicken was meh. I will say it was cooked perfectly but was missing salt in the batter and I didn't taste any chili honey flavor either. Also, when the menu says fried chicken or Tenders, I expect fried chicken or tenders. Instead, it was fried chicken breasts and chicken breast tenders. If I would have known, I would have just ordered the tenders or a smaller order because It was way too much food for us two. We ordered tge bigger portion because we thought it was just regular bone-in fried chicken pieces, not full breasts. What we ordered could have easily fed 3-4 people. The Irish nachos were good. My OJ was fresh squeezed but had no flavor?? Quality was there but it was missing something. Service was fast after you ordered. Overall good but nothing special, except for those delicious waffles. Try the yummy waffles!!!",

I've been here twice while in Las Vegas and to me, the standout quality of each sandwich is definitely the waffle.  It's not your run of the mill breakfast waffle, they either do something to the batter or use special waffle irons because the waffles are so crispy and light.  It truly accents the sandwich very nicely.  Price is on point for a brunch or lunch option.  It can get pretty busy with lines of people but there is a decent amount of seating.  My first introduction to the very concept of chicken and waffles was a parody sketch video from the internet.  The two foods only ever existed separately in my mind before then--who knew the pairing of these two could be so tasty?",

We did the 1 slider waffle sandwich and 1 slider bun deal so we could try more options. Ordered the crispy chicken and waffle slider with the cluckin' BBQ bun and they were both very delicious. Everything was so crispy, as it should be, and the flavors of both really came through. We also ordered fried pickles on the side and they were just as good. Thicker cut pickles than I expected but fried to crispy perfection with a nice tang to go well with our sliders. Very excited since I recently heard there is also on in LA so I don't have to drive Vegas just to fill a craving. Hopefully next time I have space for dessert waffles. 2 sliders for each of us was already very filling!",

I came with my family and we ordered:  The original fried chicken and waffle sandwich The waffle was cooked perfectly. It was soft and light with a crunch in every bite. Chicken was also juicy inside. It had some coleslaw inside the sandwich. Always a good choice to try for a waffle sandwich.  The original seasoned chicken tenders These tenders are pretty big. Juicy in every bite. They also come with waffle cut fries and ranch on the side. The only problem for me was, the breading and seasoning outside of the tenders was a bit too salty for me.   Kickin chicken tenders Very similar to the nashville hot chicken. Had a good spicy kick to it. Juciy chicken in every bite. But it is oily..but good.   Irish nachos For me I don't think it is worth it. Its basically waffle fries with cheese all over and small pieces of bacon. It was ok.  Overall, they know how to do good chicken and waffles. Whether its with a sandwich, tenders or even seperately. It's a must try for those who haven't tried it.",

It was pretty damn delicious.  I'm like Garfield The Cat who's theory is \"If it's not deep fried, it's not worth eating\" and the crispy 2 piece Fried Chicken definitely fit the bill.  I got the Nashville Hot version that came with a bacon cheddar waffle and some pickles.  The savory waffle was topped with maple butter and chunks of pearl sugar and I gotta say, the crunchy chunks of sugar was really addicting.  The mix of the sweet, savory, spicy, chewy, crunchy, and creamy definitely fit into the category of \"guilty pleasure\".  One thing I would be critical about is the chicken was super greasy but it was piping hot so it obviously came straight from the fryer to my tray.  Other than that, the staff was friendly and quickly cleared tables as people finished so even though it was crowded, waiting for a table wasn't a problem at all.  Next time, I need to try one of the waffle sandwiches or one of the dessert waffles.",

Once we started eating things were good until I quickly realized they did not give us the regular strips.   My mouth was on fire and I was not able to enjoy my meal so my mom took 3 of the strips back inside to switch them for regular. The guy at the register argued with her and told her they were not spicy, she took them inside so someone could have tried them but they argued instead.   I wouldn't come back to this location.",

I absolutely love the perfectly made waffles and the perfectly fried chicken. Since I'm a heavy dipper, I love that they keep the sauce out so you can choose however much you want without continuously bothering the workers. I was also able to try the fries and the fried pickles - so good! It's very casual dining here. Super busy so you have to find a seat which might take a few minutes.

I thought our table and chairs would be sticky because so much syrup gets used but it was extremely clean. The staff made sure that after every guest they cleaned and wiped down the entire area before the next person sat. I can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here again.",

I was going to see John Mayer at the T-Mobile arena and I thought, \"do I REALLY want to power through some sketch arena microwavable food right now?\" I decided I didn't. My usual alternative for a while has been Shake Shack. Because no one can argue their burgers are on point. But I decided to give Bruxie a chance that day. Was not disappointed.  Naturally I went with the chicken & waffle option (because what does \"health\" mean in America, am I right?), and the chicken was so juicy that Notorious BIG made a song about it... Juicy. I will say I've had better waffles as chicken partners before, but that's not to say it was bad. It was still pretty good. You have to be something really special to mess that combo up, and fortunately they were the other kind of special. The good kind.   I opted out of the drink and she offered me a water cup anyway. I didn't even have to ask for it. That's some nice hospitality. I appreciate the little things. It was VERY well priced for the strip in my opinion and I will be back for more artery damaging goodness in the near future.",

I like buffalo chicken, however I've never had it with waffles. For my taste buds, it wasn't the best combination. The sandwich was good, and I love the concept, but my tongue didn't agree with this pairing. For me, I'd go with the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich next time I go.  The lemonade is excellent here, you'll definitely be wanting more. Staff was cool, and always checked up as we are and kept our drinks full.

Food seems thrown together without much respect. The whole time the servers their were talking Spanish and they looked as if they were laughing and pointing at customers through the large mirror. Very disturbing and distasteful. I've been to a different bruxie and know the owners Kelly and Jean from experience and this place doesn't live up to their reputation of customer satisfaction. The girls did ok. It's the guys that need to go through more training. Will not be returning and I certainly DO NOT recommend this location to anyone.

Slightly in the salty side because they brine the meat. But it's everything you could ever want to cure a hang over.. not that I had one. Maple syrup. Solid!!

Wish we had one in Tampa Florida",

The waffles they use are perfect for sandwiches and the chicken seasoning is perfect it's not so much flavor and it's not greasy like most chicken and waffles places. I also ordered the fried pickles and WOW are those so perfect! I got a foot bear float and that was were it wasn't good. They have it in a plastic cub and the ice cream was already melted when they gave it to me and it just looked gross. The taste of it was basically all root beer. The presentation of their food and the place itself is amazing so why not make the root beer float apart if that and have a cool design? Idk it's just a thought. The food was amazing and it's very fast service literally came out in 5 minutes. They have outside seating so you can enjoy the weather with great food. Can't wait to be back In Vegas to try something else at this place.",

To get a feel for what the place is all about, we ordered a signature buttermilk fried chicken waffle sandwich, one of the spicy fried chicken waffle sandwiches, some waffle fries, and a couple of coffees. What a fantastic place.  Both sandwiches were fantastic (I really liked the slaw and chili honey on the original), the waffle fries were great, and the coffee was awesome.  For the price, this is the best deal on the strip (particularly if you are staying in New York New York, it's next door).  The service was excellent, and I can't imagine NOT visiting this place the next time I'm trying to kill a hangover in Vegas.",

After ordering, the food came out pretty quickly. My friend and I shared the original fried chicken & waffle sandwich as well as the kickin fried chicken tenders. The chicken is drenched in this sweet and spicy syrup which was just absolutely delicious. The waffle was very light, crunchy, and buttery. The tenders had a good amount of spice to it and was super crispy which I liked. The waffle fries and pickles were a good addition as well. I'm back in Seattle now and I still think about that chicken sandwich.",

First let me say this know, some people will just not like the combination of the sweet waffles and syrup with savory chicken. Some people are just not big fans. But I do highly recommend that you try it and that you try it here. Waffle had amazing consistency and texture against the crispy very well seasoned chicken. The sweet maple syrup ties the whole sandwich together and the sticky sweet crunchy contrast was amazing. I kept it simple with the chicken and waffle sandwich and that's all it needed. The location is also very nice because it's right on the Park and there's a lot of things to do right outside. They do have their own sitting area outside as well as inside but the location and the good food just brings the whole thing to a really chill vibe. Highly recommended!",

And 2 was way more than I could eat so if you are just one person I wouldn't go for 3. The butter is super sweet and mapley so don't go thinking you're going to need any additional syrup. You will not! I only wish the iced coffee options had been a bit more robust and it would be cool if they offered some hotter chicken but it was delicious as is with the chili honey drizzle! My husband got the holy whatever it's called sandwich and it was wonderful also. The Sriracha sauce was not just plain Sriracha, it was this delicious creamy substance. It was tasty altogether but looked quite challenging to eat! We arrived at 10ish on a Sunday and the line was only about 10 minutes. Friendly, fun service too!   When we walked up I was thinking this place looks like it's just going to be hipster overrated but it turned out to be as good as the reviews suggest.",

The fried chicken cobb salad that my husband ordered was pretty good, especially because they were generous with the avocado and the bacon. However, his chicken had less seasoning than mine in the sandwich, so it was a bit bland. It's okay, and reasonably priced for the Strip ($12 for a sandwich), but definitely nothing to write home about.",

Walked in and there were two employees that immediately approached us to talk to us about the menu and what's popular. Nice gesture! (o:  We were able to try the Original Buttermilk Chicken and waffles (with a side of waffle fries, nom!) and the Carolina BBQ Chicken Waffle. For drinks, we had the Arnold Palmer and Strawberry Lemonade.    The BC&W was okaaaay. The chicken itself is TOO sweet for my taste and even though it looks like a generous size chicken, it didn't feel as if it was big enough. The BBQ was so great! With or without the sauce, the pulled pork was really taste but I would suggest drowning your waffle + meat in their BBQ sauce! When you purchase a drink, it's refillable so it's def WORTH IT. Wasn't really a fan of the Arnold Palmer but the Strawberry lemonade was soOoo bomb!!!   Overall, all the food was pretty filling...but for some odd reason, it wasn't quite satisfying.BUT the waffle fries were so good that I'm definitely going to be back!",

The waffles are thin and crispy. The chicken is fried well and juicy. I say the sandwich is only \"good\" because I didn't get much spice from the chicken. I'd like the chicken to have nice flavor on its own but it didn't, especially for a spicy sandwich. The service was fast and friendly. Price was 12 for a single sandwich. That's a lot but it is the Vegas strip and kind of a fun trendy concept so I understand the cost. Not bad. I'd like to go back and try their waffle fries and a few other things but today I was solo so I only tired one item on the menu. It's worth stopping by.",

It was crowded but not what I expected. I don't mind since I wanted to check it out again. And yes I was craving some sweet and savory. I could have gone to Hash house but I wanted something different. Don't get me wrong my heart is still with the OG Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. I am a LA girl but LV is my home. So the closest I can get to RC&W is here. OK OK I should really find something not so fancy. But anyways! It wasn't so bad. I really like the strawberry lemonade. Not bad Bruxie! Not bad!   The chicken was very tasty, juicy and the crunch sound was good. I do wish it was crunchier. The waffle was good but my waffle got really soft and eeeeh after awhile. And that I didn't put to much syrup.  It's a biscuit waffle infused with bacon covered in fried chicken with a honey chili flavored maple syrup. My friend got The Original Fried Chicken & waffle.  It had some wonderful honey chili maple syrup on the chicken. The waffle fries was good, nothing wow about that. I feel that the sandwich needed something not just little coleslaw in it. OH well it was still yummie.   Would I come back here? Sure to try new things here at Bruxie.",

Someone else has the Bruxie Burger, which looked amazing, and the Crispy Chicken Tenders and Fries (which yes, is an item on the kids menu) - although, he still said it was really good. We also shared some deep fried pickles - which were HUGE. Too big for my liking, it felt like each bite was 1/3 of a jumbo pickle.   The line was huge and didn't move too quickly, but once ordering the food came out (and was delivered to the table) quite quickly. Despite it being busy, the five of us were able to grab a table just fine.  I'll be back - but not soon enough I'm afraid!",

    "text": "I came here for lunch and I gotta say, their chicken was extremely flavorful! Every bite is packed with seasoning and it was very tender and juicy. I got the original chicken and waffles and enjoyed my meal. However, I am not a huge fan of their waffles. They put a lot of sugar in their waffles which was a turn off for me because I did not want to eat sugar for lunch. Their waffle fries were average and tasty but had a little more salt than I expected.  I ordered one meal which was enough for me and one other person. It was extremely filling and I wish I got a chance to try their dessert because it looked amazing. I would definitely come here again but would not order a waffle with sugar on it.",

It was cool to try wouldn't come again though",

It was a huge disappointment. You would think for something to get 4.5 stars in Vegas it'd be good. The waffle was alright and that could be because the sandwich was blah.

It's is located right outside of where Shake Shack is and I tried this place out right after eating there and it simply blew me away.   I didn't try the chicken and waffles which I heard this place is known for but man their dessert waffles are amazing. I tried the Creme Brulee and it was the best waffle dessert I have ever had.   Even on a full stomach this place was delicious. Would for sure come back here again without a doubt.  Seating is okay, not a ton but not small.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Amazing waffles, I would go with the Original Fried Chicken and Waffle. Imho, not worth the price, but definitely should be experienced once!  First of all, parking for the Park complex was complicated for me (as is all parking in Vegas) because there is no designated parking for \"The Park\". Or at least, I couldn't find any. I just parked in New York New York, but still had to walk quite a bit to get there. (Note: Don't valet; do self-parking. Valet costs $13 here....?!?!?! Costs more than the waffles..)  The waffles themselves are one of the best! I got the Original, which was amazing! Not worth the price in my opinion, but tastes really good. The waffle fries are overpriced; just get them from Chick-Fil-A. I also got the bare waffles, which were good on their own! My mom got the lemon cream (?) and berries. It was overly sweet. I am a huge fan of lemon curd, but wow I swear my teeth were forming cavities while I took a bite. The waffles were also soggy from the curd... So I wouldn't recommend this one unless you've got an immense sweet tooth.   Service was slow, but I understand that good food sometimes takes time. Overall a decent experience. :)",
