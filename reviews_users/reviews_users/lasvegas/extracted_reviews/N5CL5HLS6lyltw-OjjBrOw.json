All the variety of salsas was cool, and we liked that it was a self serve salsa bar. The queso was delicious. The guacamole though, well they serve better at Chilis down the street. My friends tacos weren't modified how she'd asked. Although the quesadillas id gotten were pretty good. The margaritas were 10$ a piece. The server also rushed us to close out as well. Overall not that spectacular, not that horrible. Can't say I'd chose it over Chevys but I may be back, probably during happy hour for the specials.",

The seating is cheap and uncomfortable, the service is less than stellar, the decor was outdated(felt like Chotchkie's from office space), and the food left much to be desired.   The waitress got my friend's order wrong. Who would order dry enchiladas and better yet what waiter would not question an order like that? She spilt water on the table and decided to wipe it up with a dirty rag right next to my other friend's meal. Overall her attitude just felt shitty.   All of the flavors were odd and disappointing. Nothing I ordered mentioned cilantro yet it was found all over my meal. The fried avocado was heavy, oily, and just not good. Caramel filled churros contained exactly zero caramel. The biggest disappointment was the street corn. It was easily the most bland street corn I've tried.   The only reason I might find myself back there would be for the happy hour but I'm definitely in no rush.",

Only the Original Margarita is discounted (down to $5), and it's a full-sized glass instead of the typical lowball glass one might expect. I don't know if I'd splurge the $10+ for a specialty version, but the lychee one sounds delicious.  Food menu is pretty basic, with two-taco plates running $10, additional options for burritos and nachos. They get bonus points for offering vegetarian options and barbacoa, which has been difficult to find in Las Vegas- their version isn't great, but it's adequate. The $7 order of nachos (+$2 for protein) is on par with Chipotle in terms of size, taste, and price.   The service was really great, Mario and his sidekick were friendly and outgoing and checked up on us frequently. Aside from that, this place was a bit more average than I had hoped for. Considering Hussong's has been around 120+ years, the food was very Americanized... as were the prices.",

In fact, it was us and two other tables on a Monday afternoon and still took forever to get served. Famous for Margaritas?  How about never again.  Too bitter, too sweet.  Tasted like a used car salesman pissed in my mouth.   Overpriced! I would only recommend going there during happy hour and drinking a beer at the bar. Place was clean and in a great location.  That's how I gave them 2 Stars?!",

There's a full bar... and a salsa bar!   The food and decor make it appealing to want to sit for a while and hang out with your friends, be served, and have a few drinks. That's one option.   You also have the option to walk to the back, wait in a line, read the big menu on the wall, place your order, pay, then find your own seat somewhere (like at Wahoos or Panera) and they will bring the food to you. This is a great concept for people on their lunch breaks because it eliminates the middle man of waiting to order, pay the bill, etc.",

    "text": "Went there yesterday with my friends from the ballet company as our first week's celebration. We came to drink AND eat.  Now our drink (a strawberry margarita mixed with a lemon ice marg) was amazing. It's on the pricier end $10, but man do they pour the damn alcohol in it. Like seriously, I could burn off half my face with the amount they put, which to me, is a good thing. Though I only drank a quarter of the thing. Too bad. Next time ;)  The burrito was where I had a problem, and why I've reduced the star count. I enjoyed it, it was definitely a good burrito, however, our waiter asked me if I wanted it \"california style\" which I've surprisingly never heard of, being from california myself. I asked how much  more it was, and he said around a dollar. The burrito itself is $12. And when he said it would have avocado and potatoes I agreed. Sure, more food for not much. Well, my burrito had a few specs of avocado and no potatoes in it. Also, when I got my bill the burrito came out to be around $15. Last time I checked 12 + ~1 does not equal 15. Also, even without the upcharge, this is waaaay too expensive for what you get.   Had I known it was such a high charge and that I would get nothing with it I wouldn't have asked for it. So go for the margs, skip the food.",

The atmosphere is very casual and the staff very friendly and courteous. I would liken it to Chipotle meets sports bar but with higher end ingredients. The restaurant and restrooms were very clean and the service was excellent. Our party of six was seated immediately and drink orders taken on the spot. The bartender brought me the wrong beer and before it even registered in my mind, she returned with the correct beer and told me to keep the first. All right, this is my kinda place.   The menu is a bit limited, but hey, it's tacos. The street corn is charred to perfection and the salsa bar is pretty good, too.  The manager checked on us, which I always like, and we were in and out in just over half an hour. Price was very fair, too. Can't wait to go back.",

Unfortunately I did not have a pleasant time tonight. Naomi was our server, we went on 10/4/16 for $2 taco day. We ordered 1 Mexican mule, I ordered 1 chicken and 1 steak, he got 2 chicken 2 steak. We received our waters after 12 minutes, restaurant was not busy and never received our alcoholic drinks, then she forgot 2 of the 6 tacos and didn't say a word about either. We're very unhappy the quality of the food wasn't great this time either. Also, on our bill we were charged 11.25 each for our two tacos... on $2 taco day? She said it was cheaper, but somehow we ended up paying $23 for our 4 tacos, rice and waters.  We'll be back, but if I see Naomi, I'm running for the hills.",

They gave us no silverware we had to grab the silverware from the table next to us. The margarita did not taste freshly squeezed as the waitress had mentioned it tasted packed w sugar and lastly I ordered a \"chile relleno\" burrito something I see on almost every Mexican  restaurant menu. I get it they didn't have it on the menu so I knew it wouldn't be exactly what I am use to but what I got was a far from  a simple request I just wanted a chile relleno in a burrito. How hard was it to make that ? They chopped up a bunch of green peppers(not even battered or Cooked throughly, added a bit of cheese some rice and beans which contained meat in them after I clearly said no meat please. To top it off when we first sat down the first waiter was brining out chips and dip he asked if we'd like guacamole and made it seem like it was complimentary, I said yes please, we were charged for it. He should've asked if we would like to \"Order guacamole\" and not make it seem like it would be free. I am very dissatisfied w this restaurant especially after all the great looking pictures they post. The waitress was very sweet but they definitely need better training and communication skills.",

    "text": "I found about this place almost a year ago... I couldn't get enough.. the food was really good but what stuck out to me the most was the 5 different salsa they would give you and their very delicious guacamole my friends and I would fight over! Needless to say my husband and I hadn't been in a couple months so we were really excited to have our guac and salsa we always like to get... not the case anymore.... they got rid of 2 and the 3 remaining did not taste the same... I had to squeeze the lime from my margarita in my guac as well as salt and pepper.. I have never had to dress my guacamole up. I expressed my concern to the bartender who was really nice and she explained they were under new management and i could totally tell. Luckily the margaritas didn't change and they were still delicious but we left really disappointed and will more than likely not come back and give our friends a heads up so they won't waste their time either",

    "text": "I've been wanting to eat at a Hussong's forever and was never able to make it down to their locations in Mexico.   Growing up in LA, I know good Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying them out; I was NOT disappointed!    You enter the door and go straight to the counter to place your order.  Their prices are economical and comparable to Chipotle or Qdoba, but oh-so-much better!  My fiance had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans ($9.95) plus the bottomless chips and salsa for $1.95 (freshly made chips and a salsa bar for the grazing...good stuff!).  I had the chicken bowl, which included chicken, cilantro-lime rice, cheese, pineapple (it also comes with guac and onions, but I got it without).  it was delicious and a heaping portion!  I couldn't have been happier!  Speaking of happy, we were there during Happy Hour and though there are no food specials, the drinks are half off and with that, I had one of the best Margaritas I've ever had!  The beer selection is good and the well tequila was really, really good.    We were there on their grand opening night (and totally by accident) and the service was ON POINT!  Every staff member we had contact with was friendly and happy; the manager and several other servers in the bar area kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed and if everything was perfect.  Very attentive and genuinely concerned about our experience.    A great experience and we will come back again and again!!!",

I heard a lot of good things about their tacos but they defiantly did not impress me at all! In fact I didn't enjoy them one bit. I had the shrimp tacos and the sauce they put in it is just too much! They drenched the tacos with the sauce and the sauce was just too much! If the sauce tasted good it would be one thing but it wasn't at all. Same with their carnitas taco, the meat was dry and not tasty at all.",

First off they had all day happy hour on Sunday which was awesome and the decor inside was very fun and reminiscent of Mexico.   The sign on the door said best of Las Vegas for their margaritas and I completely agree. I had the original margarita on the rocks, just the right balance of sour and tequila. As for food we shared some complimentary chips, salsa and queso bean dip since it was our first time there. We also had a couple of the tacos and the carne asada fajita. I didn't care much for the queso bean dip, but the salsas were great. The pineapple one was my favorite. The fajita was also very tasty too, I liked the mix of the corn and potatoes along with the traditional peppers, onions and meat.   Overall we really enjoyed this place and can't wait to come back again for more delicious margaritas!",

    "text": "So I was invited here again! We were seated and served by Zach, the service from him was friendly and attentive.   This time I made sure to try some different things. We ordered a 3 taco plate with two fried fish tacos & a vegan 'fish' taco which came with rice and beans, a regular margarita, sangria, chips and salsa, and the vegan chocolate cake.   I really enjoyed the fish tacos and I recommend them over the other meats such as beef, chicken and pork. Also the vegan fish taco makes a pretty good substitute for fish. I'd order it again!  One thing we weren't a fan of was the rice. My brother mentioned that the rice tasted like instant rice and after that we didn't really touch it.   The chips and salsa and guacamole were all good. The chips were light and airy, out of the three salsas that came with it we enjoyed the Chipotle one the most because of its smokey sweet flavor. We got that one refilled a few times.   As for the drinks, we ordered about three margaritas. Honestly the margaritas here are so good. It's perfectly sour, salty and sweet. I'd come back to hussong's just for them. :) They have other flavor options available too but I stuck to the original because I knew it was good.   My brother got a sangria which I tasted and it was OK! I have to say I prefer the ones at firefly a lot more. I'll stick to the margaritas!  We finished with the vegan chocolate cake again, I really like the flavor of the pb frosting and the sour tomatillo sauce. :)   Prices are very reasonable, if you go at the right time. 3 of us ate and drank for around $60+tip. Not bad at all!   This place has a nice vibe with the outdoor patio. I'll definitely come back for some fish tacos and margaritas some time.",

Vegan order was not vegan, ordered the roasted corn as an appetizer but came out ten minutes after my main meal. Strawberry margarita with sugar rim was missing then fixed but was salt.  I don't want to get crazy long other then orders were messed up, orders out of sequence, not told automatic gratuity taken off the checks. It was not busy there to make sense of this.  The good was the food was pretty good. Great vegan options also.  My pork belly tacos were good but needed more sauce.  I don't think I would come back unless they want a give another try. Was a drive from Henderson also   Update 12-13-2018 I received a voucher to come back and give it another try. I went this date to the boca park location about noon.  It was slow maybe another two people there eating.  I honestly thought it would have been busier with the location and lunch time.  I came with two others and we ordered our meals.  I ended up ordering the same thing to see a difference.  The staff was friendly and took care of our needs.  Granted there was just two other people there so that could be that reason but maybe not. So back to the food.  My order was the pork belly tacos.  This time it was really good. This was a night and day change.  The two I was with also enjoyed their meals.  I would come back for the pork belly tacos but extra sauce is needed. I'm glad they saw my concerns and made a great effort and the food was good.   Thank you for allowing me to give another chance.",

Decent tequila selections but priced like you were on the strip. Cadillac Margarita was good and not made with the Crappy sweet and sour out of a plastic bottle. Craft beer also priced high at $7 a bottle.   Chips and salsa were good. I liked to trio of salsas. One was a grilled pineapple flavor sweet with a hint of spice. Chipotle had a nice smokey flavor to it. The third was very refreshing almost like a bruscheta flavor.   Elote was really good. Grilled perfectly with the right amount of cheese, mayo, and lime.   Enchilada platter was a large portion of tres stuffed corn tortillas.  Choice of chicken, carnitas, or barbacoa.  I chose one of each and I think the carnitas was my favorite. Smothered in red sauce, radish and onion to finish this dish did not disappoint.  Green and cheese sauce is also available as a choice to top you enchiladas.    Service was ok this visit. At times it felt rushed and others just lack luster. Good vibe here. I might come back for happy hour 3 to 6pm Monday thru Friday and Sunday ALL DAY!.",

I did not order food because the chips and salsa alone tasted quite bland. My friend was raving about the guacamole, but it wasn't anything special. The service was great though.

The atmosphere was pretty mellow as it was mid week when we went . Asked the waitress if they show the football games with the sound as we have found many restaurants show the game, but no sound, she said they always have it on for games and that it gets pretty busy but that they have lots of different drink and food specials. She was very apologetic for the food mix up but attempted to fix it right away when we told her about it, but hubby was very hungry so decided to keep the enchiladas. Would go back again.",

My friends vegan fish tacos looked great, she loved them. My vegan burrito was delicious and massive! I ended up having to take most of it home because of the size. I ordered a frozen classic margarita which was made really strong! I will definitely be returning to this place.",

    "text": "Hussong's consistently bad service is unbelievable.  Their original business model had you ordering at a counter and they brought your food and drinks very promptly.  But for several years now they have had a full-service business model and have the worst service of any restaurant in Boca Park and probably the entire west side.  Expect to be ignored, not seated in a timely manner, and never see your server.  Your best bet is usually to beg the bartender for what you need.  They are usually helpful.    We have tried to give them a chance on 6 different occasions since they've become a full-service restaurant over the past couple years.  The service has been consistently horrible.  It's a tragic shame because the food and drinks are wonderful.    Today my friends and I tried one last time.  After a very long wait to be seated (not due to them being busy) and of not having a server come to our table to take our order, all 7 of us got up and left incredibly frustrated.  Never again.  They are officially out of the rotation for good.",

Great flavored taco combos with refried beans and rice.  They do fried avocado too.  It can be ordered on the side like avocado fries.  Warning: addictive.  They have a margarita of the month, made with muddled cherries.  Strong stuff.  Works well for relaxation during dining.  Try it!  We tried their shrooms and veggie delight taco combo, and their chicken and steak taco combo plates.  The chicken has pineapple in it!  Wow delish!  The steak is made with pickled onions and had a very nice spice kick to it.  For sure would order the steak ones again.  The restaurant is a fairly large center bar with TV's and very casual seating inside and outside.  TV's along the walls all around and paraphernalia galore of anything and everything it seems.  Looks like a collector's arrangement of many interests.    Cool place to hangout.  Good day to come in apparently is a Wednesday; it isn't busy.  Service is polite and simple.  This side of the parking lot however is hectic.  Have patience and have another margarita.",

    "text": "I feel torn between 3-4 stars for this place. But I'll go with 3.   We bought a Groupon ($20 for $40) which was good. Started with the guac for $5.95 which comes with bottomless chips and salsa. The guac was good, not great. It was heavy on the tomatoes which I'm not a fan of. But it's a good price for an easy app. Also comes with chicharrones on the side. Never had a pork rind in my life, but gotta be honest- they're pretty good. Almost like rice cakes with more flavor. The actual chips that come with the salsa trio are not great.   My husband had the vegetarian chimichanga. He really liked his, although wish it came with rice/beans or anything on the side. I ordered the carne asada fajitas. The meat was delicious, flavorful and cooked to perfection. I was not a fan of the rice or beans. But the onions, peppers, corn and potatoes were seasoned well and a nice side. Tortillas were delicious.   We also had a pitcher of margaritas that a friend helped us with. The pitcher was 36.00 and was worth with it.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and helpful. I guess the vibe seemed dull to me, being we were some of the only people in the restaurant at that time. The story behind Hussong's is actually really interesting and being that's it's one of only a couple others aside from the original in Mexico, I would think they would have gone with a more authentic decor. Just my take.  Would probably go back again, only with another Groupon.",

It had great flavor, came in a cute small dish. Not overwhelming amount which is good before my main course. I ordered the pork belly, Barbacoa, and Baja shrimp tacos which are AMAZING! I loved all 3! My boyfriend had the chicken quesadilla which was very good as well. Hussongs is one of my favorites. Love this place.",

This is now the favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas for both my wife and me. Excellent margaritas and the tacos are excellent as well. My favorite feature of the restaurant is the Chipotle salsa which is smoky and sweet - almost has a BBQ taste to it. Highly recommended.",

Margarita was delish but over 30 min for 3 tacos? And it was not even busy for the amount of staff they had... by the time the bartender realized our ticket was \"lost\" they were out of barbacoa. Luckily it took them less than 10 minutes for them to get out the 3 tacos but the tortilla was not even cooked all the way and the tacos were not even hot. Didnt even really check up on us, didnt seem sincere about the timing, no compensation, and even short changed me. Im not the type to look for dicounts but at least seem like you care that your guests are not happy. The first time we dined here the it was sooo much better...Maybe if the staff spent less time on their phones things would have been different.",

I checked in on yelp and asked to use my check in offer which didn't specify dine in only but I was told that it was.   I ordered a veggie burrito and vegan tacos. When he read my order back he said vegan burrito. I said I ordered a veggie burrito he corrected himself and said he was indeed and veggie and NOT and vegan burrito.  We also ordered two sides of rice.   He was super rude on the phone and kinda rude in person. But showed me a new expanded vegan menu and we talked briefly about the other locations because I work at Mandalay bay. I said thank you that was nice of you and nothing no thank you good night just weird bad customer service.   When I got home to eat there were not two sides if rice and they gave me the Vegan Burrito that I specifically said I did NOT want. It was an awful burrito. I didn't eat it. It was full of green chiles and I was so dissapointed because I drove super far out of my way to go there. The experience was lack luster. I didn't eat my ten dollar burrito. And my friend didn't get anything because they didn't add the rice.   The food itself is good but they have to get there service on point to make this location successful. It'll take more than a good happy hour.   If owners are reading this and you need a new training manager call me. Would love to show you what supreme customer service reflects in your sales and yelp etc.",

The food, for us has never been the problem, the service however, that's another story.  And it's not the fault of the servers! Management needs to get a clue, and have a hostess seating people, that's how you avoid two  people sitting at six tops and making your larger parties wait for tables. Do not let people seat themselves, its a mess. Also, give your servers a busser, we were there during their happy hour on a Monday and it was busy, but the only had 3 servers working, and no bussers, and no one seating people. That's why it takes 20 minutes to get drinks out. Its not fair to your servers, as it effects their tips and their ability to make money.  Bathroom trash was overflowing, and there were crushed chips  all over the floor at the waiters station.  This place could be great if management gave their staff the tools to succeed.",

We wanted to get drinks and appetizers started while we waited for our friends, but no one even came over to the table for over 15 minutes. Bartender server guy took care of the 1top who came in after us, took a few slow minutes to make a drink, never acknowledged our table once.  We decided to leave as it was pretty obvious no one wanted to help us, and bartender server guy couldn't care less about the four of us walking out the door.  I work in the service industry and rarely write reviews, especially negative ones, but I was super disappointed in the lack of service we experienced today... Especially because the menu looked great and I was excited to be there! (added a star because the vegan menu)",

I saw on National Taco day, that they had a special on tacos and it was happy hour, so I thought it was the perfect time to try this place out. We came the perfect afternoon with perfect weather so we were able to sit outside. Their happy hour menu isn't bad. They have $15 bottomless mimosas and sangrias so of course I took on that challenge to make sure I was getting my money worth. Their food is good too. We ordered some tacos and they were ok. I wasn't a huge fan, but all of the other stuff on the happy hour menu was pretty good. They give you chips and 2 different salsas. Those I actually really enjoyed and we ate a couple bowls of them with our drinks. Oh and you get a free grilled corn when you check in on here too and that was actually pretty good. Our server was great. He always checked up on us and made sure our chips and drinks were filled. I don't know how their platters are because we stuck with happy hour, but I would definitely come back for happy hour again. They do their specials during football and hockey games too.",

The server was confused about being able to give the free item with the check in and also if we could use their promotion of $15 for $30 worth of food, but was nice about it. In the end we were able to get the free corn and also were given free queso dip and salsa for being first timers here.   The portions were huge. I ordered the big pork quesadilla. It was big so I only was able to finish half. There was more pork to cheese ratio but the food was still good. The free corn was good too. Wasn't expecting them to let us use both yelp check ins since we had two Yelpers at the table. But they did which was nice. We also ordered the churro and ice cream dessert. The ice cream was just a spoon full which was not enough for us to even share. In the end the service was a bit slower and we had to flag someone down to even take our dessert order and get boxes.",

Until i had asked the 4th time. When the server came and took our orders, her service was not great. She gave us some difficulties with our questions. Since then she served the food and never came back. I had spoke to the manager about the service and he was nice enough to solve the issues. Besides all the hassle, I must say that it was the best original margarita I have ever had!! They made the drinks from fresh lime and the drinks were pretty strong but good. Besides the drinks, the carnitas tacos are also juicy and delicious!   If you come here,  I suggest going for happy hour time from 3pm-6pm mon-fri. The drinks are reasonable price and the tacos are good for $3 each.",

Good food and good drinks, definitely make our afternoon most enjoyable.  Hussongs is one of my places to dine when my husband and I are in town about once a month.  You will not be disappointed.

    "text": "Though the name resonates with an upper middle aged crowd, this Summerlin eatery falls short in many categories and is simply not worth the time or money. Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value.   When you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for \"full service\" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is \"full service\" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us.   We left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip.   Overall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. Hussong's could learn a few things from them.",

The ambiance is very casual, which is wonderful for lunch. Don't know how the restaurant is during dinner time (since Boca Park restaurants are a zoo during dinner and weekends).  We had two servers, one who greeted us, gave us the history of the restaurant, explained the menu and made some recommendations. The service was on point, enough attention not pushy or overly annoying- just perfect. The chips were fresh and very delicious. The array of salsas that we could choose from was plentiful. I really like the spicier choices. Their original margarita was wonderful. I ordered the combo tacos (Baja shrimp and Carne Asada). Baja shrimp was best outside of Baja, Mexico. Carne Asada one was filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the beans, they were creamy and delicious.  Excellent food paired with great service!",

    "text": "I don't often leave behind a whole plate of food I've paid for and look for a second restaurant for dinner. That's exactly what I did at Hussong's.   My wife and I ordered chicken nachos, steak tacos, chips and guacamole, and tried all of their salsas at the salsa bar.   My wife and I only ate half of a steak taco, three nacho chips, two bites of guacamole, and a few dips of salsa. Everything but the chips was terrible. The chips were just standard low end chips.  The nachos, chicken, and salsas can be summed up with the phrase, \"what is that flavor?\" For the chicken it was something red that doesn't quite taste like tomatoes. For the fresca salsa it was something that tasted like tomatillo but not, and was much stronger. For the hotter salsas it was something that reminded me of a mole, a deep rich flavor that clashed hard with the salsa. For the nachos it was a combo of whatever makes the chicken gross and something green that I have no idea what to compare to.   The steak tacos were a complete joke. Easily some of the lowest quality meat we've had. Even by Mexican restaurant standards. We weren't expecting filet or ribeye, but this meat was just pure gristle and tendon. Totally unacceptable.   Finally the guacamole. It might as well have been a bowl of cilantro. There was so much cilantro it was completely inedible for both of us. My wife looked at me incredulously when I called it \"inedible\". Sometimes when it comes to cilantro I can exaggerate a bit. So she took a bite, looked at me with a funny look on her face, and said, \"wow, you're right: inedible.\"  In the end -- about 4 minutes after the beginning -- we got up, still hungry, and walked away from a still-full table of terrible food.  I lost $30 so you don't have to. You're welcome.",

    "text": "Not really feeling this place. Went for a Friday happy hour. Firstly, I'm not a fan of the \"order at the counter, we'll bring it to you\" thing. Am I at a sit down restaurant or a Cafe Rio/Chipotle? The menu felt confusing and was ridiculously limited. It basically is a Chipotle with booze, except the food at Chipotle is way better.   I had the carnitas salad, which consisted of romaine lettuce, pickled onions, carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies. Nothing particularly interesting, inventive or good about it. The food came quickly and the margarita was fine.   Another thing that bugged me was one of the giant TVs was tuned to a network evening news program. I don't know about you, but when I want drinks and fun evening out, seeing various dramas/tragedies being broadcast doesn't exactly add to my experience. This was a one and done for me, I won't be back.",

You are greeted by a nice friendly hostess who is very welcoming. We had the option of sitting outside or inside and being such a beautiful night we took outside sitting (I recommended it) the waiter was friendly and gave us enough time to look over the menu before we ordered (I hate being rushed) I ordered the combo plate that included rice and beans    steak, shrimp and fish taco they were delicious (the combo comes with 2 tacos i ordered an extra taco).  At the end of our meal we decided to order dessert coconut flan and it was very creamy as it should be. I will be recommending this place to my friends.",

They didn't seem at all bothered by the lack of clientele - which I truly appreciate, as I have spent many of my days serving.   We were greeted by Zack. Who I loved. Bright smile, engaging, cracked some jokes... everything you want in a server. I would like to see him move on to a higher-end restaurant on the strip.   Chips&Salsa ADD GUAC- Chips were hot and fresh, I could've eaten 3 more baskets. The guac was limey, I loved it and basically ate the whole bowl to myself but hubby thought it was too much. Our girls demolished the salsa.  My not daughters ordered chicken fingers ... you can't really mess that up so I'll move on.  Chicken tacos- full of flavor. The rice was typical but the beans were not what you'd expect - in a good way... almost like refried beans and Bush's BBQ baked beans had a baby.  Steak barbacoa fajitas- marinated. Steak. So much yes.  In addition to our feast hubby and I enjoyed margaritas. El Pepino & The Skinny. Both well balanced and sized appropriately. I'll order them again.  By the time we walked out the place had filled up and I would like to note that our table was bussed by two other servers. Clearly the staff here is a \"team\" and selfless employees are a key component to a great restaurant.   Overall we are happy we popped in. Thank you.",

I just wanted a snack so I only got a taco and chips with salsa. I ordered the chicken taco, while the bartender recommended something more adventurous like the fried avocado taco, but also said the chicken tacos were good as well. It was so much better than I expected a chicken taco could be! Just an interesting mix of flavors and I'm a huge pineapple fan so that made it a memorable little lunch for me. I also really enjoyed the chipotle salsa. I don't typically like smokey flavors much but the chipotle salsa is the perfect mix of smokey and sweet; they even sell it by the pint for less than five bucks (you can't even beat that at the grocery store). By the time my boyfriend met up with me, I was ready for one of their margaritas, which they say are the best in town. I can't say whether or not that is True, as I haven't had many margaritas in Las Vegas, but it was a pretty good and fresh- and natural-tasting cocktail - and as my SO pointed out, *very strong* haha.",

It's a Friday night, there should be plenty of staff available to help out. No manager came to apologize for the delay or at least get me started with drinks.

So, if you aren't really hungry and have some time to kill, then this place is for you  otherwise I would recommend you go across the street to Cheesecake Factory where the business is busy but can still offer excellent service.",

It was the best guacamole I've ever had and I've had a lot. It came with some pork rind on the side and 3 salsas. Their margaritas were voted the best in vegas this year by the lvrj and I'm not going to argue.  We came in here after a bad experience at a Mexican place down the street in Tivoli village.",

Took them 10 mins to even come over and get our drink order. We had to ask them to place an order (like are you kidding). I double checked on Yelp to see if they were closing (since we went on a Sunday and they're times could be different) and they didn't close for another hour and half. Used the coupon on Yelp for the queso dip and they decided to not bring it out until all of our food was done. After we just sat there we had to ask them for the check (since they didn't really care about our table at all). And our bill was wrong. Sorry but I'll go and spend my money over at The cheesecake Factor or Kona Grill next time.",

And I gave the restaurant a chance to prove to me they deserve my 5 star review. The first time I read the reviews I was skeptical of the words Yelpers used like \"authentic Mexican food\". Being of Hispanic roots and a Southern California native, I.e The OC Santa Ana & Placentia which have are some of the best authentic Mexican food\". I'm no expert. With that said I'm not a real big fan of the refried beans & rice. But I didn't feel my personal preference should affect the 5 star rating. I make mine from scratch and I didn't get that taste from either one. I am closer to vegan then vegetarian so how excited am I that a Mexican restaurant serves us plant eaters lol. I've had the fish tacos and I had no idea they were vegan. Very good. I've also had the veggie fajitas, Wow the smell of them cooking and the fajita taste was everything. Today I ordered Baja Style \"chicken\" and \"beef\" tacos with beans and rice. I had no idea they were vegan. Which I personally don't need my vegan food to resemble too much like the real thing because I chose to not eat animals. But I get it and it's cool with me. I felt the cheese on the tacos were a little skimpy though, for the price of the meal. My family members are meat eaters and have had meals from chicken to beef tacos, to wet burritos and Chile rellenos. We are all still coming back. Complimentary chips and salsa which are awesome. Original classic margaritas shaken just for your pleasure. I love local businesses that cater to our local teams. Happy hour during NFL games and VGK games scoooore!!! Daily 3-6. Summer time is awesome eating, drinking watching games on their outdoor patio with outdoor tv. Such a cute restaurant with a lot to look at. Variety of seating, for families with children and a bar for adults. Maybe you'll see me there. Hasta",

I understand they have fine margaritas; I suppose if you went for drinks and chips it could be a satisfactory experience, for me not so much.",

    "text": "Saturday night dinner craving some Mexican cantina style food. Wife and I were near Boca Park (NW Vegas) and wanted something other than Wahoo's Tacos in the same shopping mall.   We soon remembered that we always overlooked Hussong's deep in the shopping center and decided to give it a try. These kind of cantinas are pretty much all the same with what they can offer in food; burritos, tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, quesadillas and they have a burger there somewhere on the menu too. The proteins are all that can be expected; shrimp, fish (grilled or deep fried cod), carne asada, chicken & or pork.   C'mon, you know already..Americanized Mexican foods... in the dining experience with all kinds of sh!t on the wall (street signs, stickers, pictures of people having smiles on their face while partying by the beach scantily clad) and an inviting bar in the middle of the dining area with neon signs around.  Sound familiar? Oh yeah.   The place was organized, had a patio to eat on but still too hot for Vegas's hot Aug. nights. Dining room was tidy as we got our basket of chips and 2 saucers of salsa. We scanned the easy menu (see above explanation) and ordered with the attentive server (Johnathan) who had a good understanding of the menu when asked. Wife asked about the fish tacos. She ask how the fish was prepared and what kind of fish. Johnathan replied with fried or grilled Cod. She picked grilled.  I had the carne asada burrito.   Food came timely and at a great temperature in relation for how I assessed how busy they place was. Everything was delicious as to be expected; but nothing stood out as spectacular or uniquely \"Hussong's Mexican Cantina!\"  Overall... a great place to meet up for drinks after work, casual dates and/ or bring a (young) friend to introduce them to the new flavors of Mexico ... in case the were living under a rock.   I can see going back, but not to look for adventurous eating or tongue-pallet ecstasy.....I'd actually go back for a familiarity to chain restaurants, easy menu, child friendly and main stream simple pleasures. We left a nice tip and were pleased with our experience. Give it a try if this is what you're looking for.",

First thing's first, bottomless tortilla chips are served with not one but three salsas ($1.95)!   You can choose from either fish, beef, or chicken (vegan) tacos. My husband tried all 3 and we both agree, the fish tacos are the winner here. The fish Baja tacos are topped with a cabbage medley and aioli that is just the bees knees. The Baja taco entree ($13.95) is served with rice and beans and comes with two tacos. It's super filling, especially after you've been stuffing your pie hole with chips and salsa.   Service has always been great here and it's never too busy. I have yet to try the house margarita, though. I'm looking forward to an all-day happy hour on a Sunday in the future.

A great touch are the fun games such as Jenga and Os and Xs at the bar that you can play to pass the time.  The only reason to drop a star is that the desserts left a little to be desired. The deep fried ice cream in particular with fruit coulis was literally a scoop of vanilla, wrapped in frosted flakes and accompanied with less than 1 strawberry. No 'coulis' in sight. Definitely not worth the money and a disappointing dish.",

The waitress didn't come to check on the table for awhile and when she did she offered to bring a side of the sauce. At this point I was over it. The food wasn't the best and I will not be returning.

    "text": "It opened on Monday and I visited on Friday July 24th around 7:30pm.  I came in the back door and sat down at the bar. I used to frequent this place when it was Embers so the changes in the place were interesting to see, with the removal of the wall separating the bar and dining tables, as well as lighter wood stains and red upholstery on the chairs. Lots of random pictures and posters adorn the walls. The bar has two hanging bottle displays with different tequilas in them. I really liked the interior as it seemed lighter and fresher.  Bartender Justin spotted me and came over to take my order. He recommended an \"original\" margarita so I went with it ($10.95). He gave me some good recommendations on tacos as well since I don't like spicy food. Tacos are 2 for $9.95. I missed out on the Happy Hour menu which has discounts for drinks only.  Original Margarita - I'm not a huge margarita fan, I usually enjoy tequila as a shot. This was ok, nothing special in my book.   Tacos - I went with a chicken taco that comes with fresh pineapple on top, and the pork belly taco (extra $1). Both were plenty big and very well made with lots of meat. The pork belly taco was delicious with a sweet marinade sauce and some crispy pork rinds on top.   Service was great, Justin kept using my name during conversations, and checking up frequently and keeping my water glass full. The other bartender whose name I don't remember didn't hardly even look my way, nor smile much while she was working the other side of the bar. There was a manager guy there who seemed like he was watching the bartenders work and he also didn't smile much or seem to have much customer connection.   Overall, I'll probably come back during Happy Hour when drink prices are a little more reasonable. One thing I did notice was the bartenders shirts said \"Serving up fun since 1932\" or some year, yet the place didn't really seem all that fun. It seemed like a business.",

    "text": "Man I wish margaritas weren't so delicious and refreshing.   When you walk into a place and the barkeep tells you they are the inventors of the \"Original Margarita\", well you might as well stick a fork in me, 'cause I ain't going nowhere anytime soon.  In case you're wondering, the \"Original Margarita\" is a damn fine margarita.  My barkeep was House, and he was just about as brilliant as his more famous medical namesake.  I started with the Mexican corn. Mexican corn is a truly odd experience for a Midwestern kid who was raised on corn-on-the-cob. Back home, the only way people cooked corn-on-the-cob was in a pot of boiling water, a method which all but removes every bit of flavor from the corn (it's a wonder I wasn't culinarily scarred for life).   Forgive the tangent here, but if I could travel back in time, I would go back to my grade school self and introduce myself to Mexican Corn (and then we would explode into non-existence when we make contact in the congratulatory high five).  Needless to say, there is a reason the Mexican Corn is pretty much the only picture on the menu. No matter what else you try, you need to try the Mexican Corn.  House picked two tacos for me and kept the margaritas flowing. I will honestly admit I cannot remember which tacos I got, but that may be due to House's master mixology skills. I can say, without a doubt, that they were two of the best I have ever had.  The prices here are quite high, which is the sole reason for the missing star. I'm not completely saying the price point doesn't match the food and service quality, but the prices need to come down a little bit to be a 5 star joint, especially on the \"Original Margarita\", which hits you at a whopping $10 a piece.   But the good news, happy hour has the \"Original Margarita\" at half price. Guess where you'll be finding me from now on?",

I've only gotten their take out so I can't account for the innards of the restaurant but I can for sure tell you about the taste of their food.   First their vegan habanero guacamole is the bomb. Not spicy enough for a spice chaser but it's super delicious. I'm always leery of getting guacamole at places since a lot use dairy ingredients in their dip, but with the vegan seal of approval, I'd have to say this is the best vegan guacamole I've had yet! Paired with their crispy warm and salty tortilla chips...heaven!   My favorite item is the vegan chimichanga with the faux chicken strips. It's so crispy and cheesy, and yummy. They really can make the food taste flavorful without using the typical ingredients.   I 100% recommend Hussong's, try it out, you'll love it!",

They always bring out fresh chips with three different kinds of salsa (fresca, pineapple, and a smokey one - maybe Chipotle) before the meal. Just make sure you don't fill up on that so you can enjoy the awesome food. They use Gardein for their vegan meats, and they definitely know how to prepare it; every time I've eaten here the food is top-notch. Most recently I tried their vegan breakfast burrito and loved it. The potatoes were nicely spiced, and the rest of the ingredients complimented each other very well. A friend got the vegan quesadilla and it was amazing; spicy, savory, and just a little sweet, which you'd think would be weird, but it worked really well.",

My date got the cheese enchiladas and I could tell he wasn't that pleased with his either, but he still finished it.  I didn't even eat half of mine, even though I was starving.

He lingered and my husband asked if he was a manager or owner...he said YES I AM THE MAN! My husband then made small talk about never knowing with all these reality shows and youtube tricks...the owner (Brian) then asked AGAIN for the menu. He responded no thank you. Brian lingered again and asked AGAIN. I said- he just told you no...he'd like to order more, spend more money. Brian then proceeded to tell us loudly in front of many other tables I JUST BOUGHT THOSE NEW MENUS AND I'M JUST WATCHING BEANS ON THEM! I sort of laughed and said that they were the washable kinds of menus and that he was being ridiculous.  It is very clear he should keep to the business side of things and leave the employees and patrons alone! It was a very unneeded experience! I hope he reads this and realizes what an impact his negativeness made...I've NEVER written a negative review EVER!",

Hussong's has a whole vegan menu with four choices that can be put into tacos, salads, or bowls. The chicken tacos were SO good, and so was the fried avocado. We're looking forward to going back to try the two other flavors! Seating is very limited, but we got a table for our party of 5 quickly. Service was perfect, and they were happy to explain the menu items and answer all our questions. We're so happy to have an alternative to Chipotle or the veggie burger some places offer. We'll be back!!",

    "text": "Let me begin with walking through the door. The decor is a tad off and didn't make much sense. This is not an actual restaurant either. You have to order your food and then sit down, i.e. chipotle. If you sit at the bar however, you get full service. Well, the best thing about this place was Amanda the bartender. She was so amazing and attentive. If we were to return it would be to just sit at the bar and have her make us the amazing margaritas she made for us. My husband had the original and I had the El Pepino. Awesome! The food was mediocre. The chips and salsa were like from the grocery store. The chips were stale and had no flavor. The salsa (they have 4 to choose from) were nothing to talk about. When we made our order with Amanda she asked if we wanted some guacamole. She offered us regular or mango habanero. We decided to try the mango habanero, I mean why not? Well, I guess the statement \"don't fix what's not broke\" definitely applies here. The girl Summer who brought it out to us literally threw it on the bar and said \"mango habanero\" and walked away. Talk about the poorest of customer service skills.  The worst part was the manager Chris. Everyone can understand being in control of your employees and making sure the jobs is being done. However, I don't respect a manager reprimanding, micro-managing or being disrespectful to his employees in front of patrons. This is exactly what we witnessed. Very uncomfortable. Also, I went to get some salsa and he made me move around him instead of stepping aside to let me pass. One out of respect for a lady and two for a paying customer.  The bottom line is we were excited to try a new place close to home that we could frequent and unfortunately this is not the case.  I will most definitely not return for the food but, may just to have a drink with the only person that had any customer service skills Amanda. I'm sorry to be frank but, when we spend over $60 dollars and this was the service and quality of food we received I strongly feel others should know too. I mean this is why we Yelp, is it not?",

We made it for the last few minutes of happy hour, and the bartender let us know it was still HH and she took our order right away. The chips and salsa came with 3 salsas. I loved the spicy salsa and mango salsa! Both had great flavor. The more mild red salsa wasn't my favorite, but my BF loved it- to each their own! All staff were friendly and service was fast. They took a custom veggie order for a chimichanga, which made me happy. And my BF really liked the HH carnitas tacos. OH AND the margarita were great (no mix) and not too sweet. We will be back.",

So, go here fo the bar and NOT for the beans. The steak tacos were good but we just couldn't get over the beans and rice...yuck!

We were greeted and sat quickly and kindly.  Our server welcomes us and asked if we have been in before. We had not.  He welcomes us and explained some menu items and brought over an appetizer for us.  He recommended an amazing margarita for me to try that was not on the menu. It was delicious!  My fiance had a burrito and I had enchiladas. My favorite part was that I got to choose the sauce and they even let me to 50/50 so I could try what I wanted.   Both of our meals arrived quickly, hot, fresh, and were delicious!  The appetizer we had was a bean queso dip and it was delicious as well! We were stuffed and satisfied!  The manager came over after to check on us and make sure we were satisfied, gave us his business card and encouraged us to come back and call him if we needed a table to watch a certain sports game.  The food and customer service will bring us back again! I highly recommend giving this place a shot and ignoring the current star review.  I can tell they are trying to turn it around and they are succeeding!",

The chicken taco was okay, but the meat wasn't very flavorful. The carnitas taco was dry and probably the worst option. The tacos were served on soft corn tortillas, that looked heated in oil. They serve their plates with cilantro lime rice and pinto beans.   The service wasn't bad. The bartender took our order and a waitress showed up to see if we were doing okay and  brought our food.   Unlike other places this one charges $2 for bottomless chips and salsa. Not a fan of this...especially if you're charging $10 for 2 tacos w rice and beans (add $$ if you want a 3 taco plate). The salsa is a self serve salsa bar with 4 types of salsa. A mild pico de gallo red (meh), tomatillo (the best option), a spicy red sauce (2nd best option), and the fourth was a spicy green.   Bottom line, the food wasn't exceptional and it cost $38 +tip for x2 3 taco plates with rice and beans with chips/salsa and 2 beers. Not cheap for a Mexican style lunch. I should mention they have cheaper prices on the menu for happy hour (3-6pm), but I wouldn't make a special trip for HH.",

    "text": "I hate to say it, but I like this place. Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in.   As for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious.   Less noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.  3.5 Stars",

Our waitress was nice, the atmosphere was cool, but the one star lies in the quality of the food/drinks.   We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, and what we got was a pitcher of what looked like 7up with maraschino cherries in it and tasted like a non alcoholic Capri Sun. Zero buzz was had.  Chips and salsa next. They brought out a tray of three different types of salsa that i guess maybe they make there? Pineapple, Chipotle and Habanero. The only remotely good one was the habanero. The other two were literally so awful we didn't touch them after one taste.   On recommendation from the server, I ordered the pork belly tacos. My wife ate the carne asada tacos. Both dishes lacked serious flavor, and the pork belly, for some reason, was diced up extremely small in the taco. When ive had pork belly, its always been whole so you can really get the flavor and texture from the fat and the meat. This was just strange.   At the very end of the meal, our waitress finally brought us the waters we asked for when we ordered the Sangria. We were already paying the bill. Thanks for that.  Also, WAY overpriced.",

I ordered the carne asada, and it came out with a tiny  pice of meat ALONE on a plate, I had to ask for everything the menu said my meal came with. then they brought out everything individually. and as I've been typing I'm still waiting for sour cream to dress my cold, dying, carne asada taco",

A short while later, a female came over and said she was the manager and took our orders.  We did advise her of the awful response from the bartender.  She did apologize and took care of our drinks.  Turns out she is the manager/waitress.    The food was not very good, in some cases, barely edible and we were all so disappointed that we felt we would never come back, no matter what.  It should be noted that we came in after the lunch rush, so the place was pretty empty.",

The chips they bring out are complimentary and the salsa is more than decent. On the happy hour drink menu is also beer and shots, plus, they will honor a coronarita-type drink if you mention it being on the old happy hour menu!

Wherein I think they fall down is that they have the hardest if not antiquated restaurant chairs I've ever sat in - they could stand to be updated with a better quality of chair.  -The real issue though, is the food.  I just don't think they are up to the standards of other Mexican restaurants.  I had a chicken chimichanga and found it rather tasteless with little chicken and a whole lot of merely, plain rice.  I can see where those younger who haven't refined their palates in eating a variety of foods or places wouldn't mind, but I think most who've \"been around\" with greater restaurant experience would feel it's below par in these two areas.",

No service, unless you wanted an alcoholic beverage, and that was an awful experience.   Tonight we decided to give Hussong's another chance. Walser was our server. Not only was he so personable, his recommendations were spot on, and he treated us so well.  The manager Arturo delivered us our drinks and brought us fresh chips and salsa. He assured us that if we needed anything further he'd be happy to help, and we could tell he meant it. Service was quick, the food tasted fresh and delicious.   We ordered the chicken & carne asada fajita plate, Baja shrimp tacos & the El Pepino margarita.  The carne asada was so uniquely delicious!  The margarita, made with agave nectar, fresh lime juice, jalapenos, & cucumbers hit the spot.  We are so happy we decided to give Hussong's a second chance. Walser and Arturo mentioned there's a mariachi band every Sunday, so we made reservations for a friends birthday party!   What a fun place to have dinner. We are so excited to go back on Sunday.",

The service was great, the server was very friendly and got our drink orders to us fast. The food came out fast too, as expected, since it was pretty slow.   The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is due to the food. We found everything to be quite bland, very little flavor. I guess that's what to expect from a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Summerlin, but I had higher expectations.   I got the Quesadilla with chicken, and honestly couldn't take a bite without covering it in salsa, because it was so bland. My mom got the tacos and felt the same way.   Like I said before, maybe don't walk in with the expectation of eating some amazing Mexican food, because you might be disappointed.   Overall good experience service wise!",

Food is overall pretty good, topped with a fun atmosphere and good service. Makes me think I'm in Cali by the beach or someplace besides Boca Park. Staff wS super friendly and helpful .. we ate at 5:30pm on a Friday and was able to manage a good seat. The main area is a big rectangle bar with seating all around and a nice patio seating area in the front.  My family all liked the chips and salsa. Chips are sorta plain store bought style but get it done. Two types of salsa, one tomato based and the other roasted. Both good. We had a chorizo queso dip appetizer that was also pretty good! A few beers and margaritas and I had combo tacos of shrimp and one fish... both good. Not a fan of the beans but the rice was good. Had a really good off the cob street corn too!  Check it out for a fun playful hangout with great staff and pretty good food. We will definitely go back for sure.",

Stumbled upon the Hussong's the \"creator of the margarita\" and had a fabulous lunch. Free chips and salsa and if you Yelp check-in voila you get a free grilled corn. Truly a must for you foodies even if you have to pay for the corn. Perfectly seasoned with chilli-lime salt butter-mayo and Smokey from the grill. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hubby had the fish tacos, which he loved and I had the chili relleno, wow best I've ever had. Served on a bed of diced meat with a heap of avocado as well as beans and rice. I always wondered why this dish didn't come with meat a nice way to go.  Oh so yummy. And if you can't make it out to Summerlin no worries they have one on the strip too oh and the original in Encinitas in Mexico.  Enjoy!",

Between the two of us we had carne asada, pork belly, and carnitas tacos. It was nice outside today but we opted to sit inside. It wasn't busy when we got there at 12:30 but was quite busy when we left around 2. My friend really liked the food.  This is my second visit to Hussong's, but the first one at the Boca Park location. Service was excellent at this location. The manager stopped by our table a few times, making sure we were happy with our food. My first visit was at the Mandalay Bay location and that visit left a lot to be desired. We have another reservation at the Mandalay Bay location in two weeks. I'm hoping we will get the same kind of service as we had at the Boca Park location.",

    "text": "Sometimes being too hungry at restaurant can be a bad thing. You end up asking \"why did I eat all that?\" it wasn't very good or at best you tell yourself it was just ok. If I'm going to eat something fattening or bad for me it better be awesome.    That's the problem with Hussong's, the food at best is ok but their use of processed cheese makes so many of their dishes underwhelming. Our friends got there first and ordered a dish of melted white cheese mixed with processed cheese, and chips and salsa, which unfortunately were the highlight of the meal. The salsa was tasty but had not even a hint of heat. We had their happy hour menu -tacos of chicken, carnitas, barbacoa, a quesadilla, their original margaritas and the bulldog. The barbacoa was not bad, much much better than at hip fusion Mexican restaurants. The carnitas and chicken tacos we didn't like and our friends found them unpalatable as well. The quesadilla didn't have much cheese and had a strange layer of chips inside. I assume they were there to add texture but by the time the got to our table it was just more soggy tortilla.  The margaritas were delicious but a tad sweet and not very strong. The bulldog is a margarita crowned with a beer on top. I liked that the beer helped cut down on the sweetness and added a carbonated fizz. When I think of margaritas and tacos I think of the long gone Mercadito at Red Rock Casino during their first couple of years they produced strong distinctively delicious margaritas and a variety of scrumptious tacos before downgrading their food to save money.  Compared to that standard Hussong's food is just average at best.   Some people have had issue with the service but our server, Bridget, was outstanding she was quick, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere is trendy Mexican restaurant-not upscale-but warm and friendly. Overall the food is just tame toned down homogenized Mexican food.",

The barbacoa tacos were one of the best I've had and the ceviche sauce was even better. The food was fantastic but the service made it less enjoyable. We had three different servers so each time they brought something they gave to the wrong person. When it came time to pay it took about 30-45 minutes in entirety to pay. I walked to the front and that's when the waitress finally gave me my card back. The menu is perfect but needs work on service.",

Service was not good, happened to stop in during happy hour but we did not know it was and our server did not tell us. Overheard another server telling a couple about HH. Seems like good food and drink specials. Ordered lots of food. Most was good. I review each under attached photos. My son and husband both ordered chilaquiles. My husband's red sauce was burnt, he sent it back for another chicken quesadilla. My sons chilaquiles were also burnt. Both the chips and the sauce were burnt. He asked for them to be remade but waitress told him that most likely they would also be burnt so he did not order anything else. The manager did not remove the chilaquiles from our bill even though they were not edible. Also checked in on Yelp and showed the waitress the free corn offer, SHE pressed the 'Redeem Offer's  a button in hubby's phone and she brought the corn and then charged us for it. We did not notice until after we left that we had been charged for the burnt chilaquiles and the corn Yelp offer until after we left so husband Called manager Brian and were told that can not use the help offer with the Groupon and only said sorry about that. Waitress knew we had a Groupon when we walked in but failed to mention that when we showed her the Yelp offer. Overall, the food was good except the chilaquiles, but the service, particularly the service from the manager was not good.",

I ordered the fried mushrooms tacos that included fried habanero spirals. I requested the spirals to be left off, the problem was they weren't! I unfortunately don't do spice. I took a huge bite, and literally thought I was going to die, plus my water was gone. I was able to waive the waiter down who refilled my water, brought limes, and extra napkins as my nose was seriously leaking . The manger offered to remake and give me me a discount which was appreciated. I got the fresh made taco  but the discount wasn't applied sadly. I did seriously enjoy other aspects of my meal and most likely will be back, but will be more cautious before I take a bite!",

Service was great, nostalgic walls to read and look at all the cool pictures... This place started over 100 years ago in Mexico, no bs.

They can make a margarita so fast it's done before you say \"Margarita!\" They have really good happy hour food. Which means a little smaller portions than you would get for a regular dinner. Which is ok because it gives you the chance to same a few more of the apps!

Totally recommend sitting outside as they have ceiling fans blowing as well as misters to keep the Vegas heat from getting to you. Robert was our server and Walfer greeted us so welcoming and we ordered the chicken tostada salad, carnitas burrito, and shrimp tacos. We also ordered the Romance beverage which is 64 oz of a balanced not so sweet but sweet enough drink almost like a sangria but with tequila. It's huge!!! What a fun drink to take pictures with too!! Love being welcomed by warm chips and salsa with a smile!   We got here around 7pm and stayed til around 10pm. We ordered 5-64oz drinks and enjoyed everyone of them 8-0  What a great time and just a fun place for family and friends to get together and to let loose while enjoying good food and drinks.   I can't say enough about Robert our professional and personal leader server and Walfer the server. Fun and just loving life and made us feel so welcomed and carefree. Enough to spend $350 and tip enough to make everyone feel like a job well done and smile at the end of the night!   Can't wait for another long weekend to party it up with class and pizazz!!   Thank you Art the manager for making everything just extra amazing! We love and appreciate you all and can't to come back soon! To be honest we planned",

People like Zak make you want to come back to a restaurant. I ordered steak tacos with double rice instead of beans. It was delicious! My friend ordered quesadillas with a crispy shell in the center. She said it was definitely something she would have again. We must have stayed in the restaurant for 2 hours. (yes~I gave a bigger tip since I stayed longer). Zak never rushed the bill and checked on us often. I think we went at a slow time of the day. There were not allot of people in the restaurant. I will definitely put this on my list of restaurants to return to. If you're in the Boca Park area definitely give this place a try!",

Let me just say that it's a nice little place with a lot of cool historical decor and pictures. Our drinks were delicious and boozy, and the chips and salsa were great. Plus, it was really refreshing to see a whole vegan menu instead of just 1 or 2 options. I opted for the \"fish\" tacos and they were INCREDIBLE. Not too spicy, but just spicy enough, and the slaw that comes on them is just  so good.   The staff is very polite and friendly. We came during dinner time, so our service was a little slow, but they genuinely apologized for the delay. I mean, we came during dinner, what did we expect? Lol Overall, next time I find myself in Vegas, I'll make sure to take time off the strip to come back!",

The place is a nice size restaurant but wasn't crowded. The atmosphere is fun and even better on a hot summer day when you can sit outside. My friend I met had already secured a table for us. We both checked in and found out there was a Yelp special. With any entree, you receive a free Mexican street corn or Elote as it is called. Neither one of us was real hungry and it was Taco Tuesday so we both ordered some tacos and the Mexican street corn.   The Mexican street corn arrived first and it was rather mediocre. When it arrived, it was luke warm and if you are like me, I enjoy my food piping hot. The taste of it was also just not real good. It wasn't awful, but I have had better elsewhere. Our tacos came out next which again my taco was not hot and the chicken was dark meat which I prefer white meat. The service was pretty good although it did seem like it took a while to receive our dinner which was not a complicated order. Although I chose not to drink on this occasion the drinks on others tables looked very tasty so this might be what they are really good at.   Will I return, maybe for a cold brew or margarita but probably not for the food.",

Fresh food (not processed) is best, so unfortunately I won't be returning to Hussongs.",

    "text": "I drove into Boca Park not sure of where I'd go.  After parking which is always a pain, I started walking toward another restaurant when I saw Hussong's and decided to give it a go.  I'd eaten at the one in Mandalay Place and this appealed to me.  I was seated inside and had a great view of the baseball game on the TV near me, and I had a great view of the bartender who could hold four bottles in her two hands to make whatever drink it was.  I looked over the menu for awhile before checking in.  I found after checking in that there's a free street corn serving for the Yelp checkin.  Then I made the decision to go with something completely different--fried avocado tacos.  During the time, I had iced tea and enjoyed the chips and salsa.  One salsa was fairly standard and had a modicum of heat.  The other was a fire roasted tomato salsa.  When ordering, I had asked the server for the corn first and then the tacos.  After waiting a while, a runner came with the corn and the tacos in one batch.  The corn cob was just barely warm.  It was very good tasting with the cheese.  After finishing the corn, I went to the tacos which also were just barely warm.  The fried avocado was accompanied with Sriracha aioli, a small amount of Caesar salad, and some queso fresco.  They would have been more enjoyable had the appetizer and main dish been coursed as I said when I ordered.  The place was OK.  It certainly was a different kind of taco.  I might return just to have some more.",

Me and my Co workers thought we would be able to receive our free street corn for checking in on Yelp but because we were using a Groupon we weren't able to redeem both deals. I think if I were to go without the Groupon this place would be way too expensive for Mexican food. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay for bottomless chips and salsa either. Their salsa was good but not anything remarkable about it. I ordered the chimichanga with carnitas and red sauce and the burrito was great. I love the red sauce sort of thick so it was perfect for me. The rice however wasn't anything special, very basic. I did however get their street corn and that was great! Probably the best thing there! All in all I think this place was great but a little pricey for Mexican food. If we hadn't used a Groupon our meal would have probably been around $60",

She would hand out food from over the pony wall near the bar while the waitress was getting our order... Or reach over the pony wall to get old dishes... It was the most oddest thing I've ever had happen at a restaurant.... Other than that food was amazing even the margaritas!!",

    "text": "We walked in several days ago to enjoy some lunch on the patio.  There was no hostess, so after waiting a few minutes, we seated ourselves at one of the two empty tables.  Neither had been cleared from the previous guests.  We waited about ten minutes, but no waitress or bus-staff appeared on the patio, even though it was busy.  Finally, a waitress showed up on the patio and helped a couple of tables.  As she was leaving, without stopping at our table, I asked her if she was our waitress.  She replied there was another person working the patio with her and said \"oh, you haven't been helped yet?\"  and left.  We expected someone  to return with menus and to clean the table.  This did not happen, so after five minutes we left.  Management seems to be MIA and the staff appears to be poorly trained.  I can't comment on the food because we were never able to order any, but the service, obviously, is horrible.",

It took someone 10 minutes to approach us. We were not told about the self service chips and salsa until we asked for some. At that point we were told we have to get it ourselves. Weird. When we ordered we watched the waitress walk around for 5 minutes before putting our order in. After we were done eating it took another 15 minutes to get our check. The wait wouldn't have been a problem if they were busy but they weren't. Also the food wasn't great. My chimichanga wasn't cooked all the way and the cheese dip was not your normal Mexican queso dip. I wasn't a fan.",

    "text": "My family and I normally love this place up until this past Friday night. I was lucky enough to come here prior to them opening to the public to sample and critique the Cantina. I loved it! we have been here a minimum of 10 times since then. Back to Friday Night and the 2 star rating!  We get there at 9:00 pm, order our food, sit down outside, in a few minutes we get our food served by the gentleman from the kitchen. the waitress that was helping the other patrons outside literally blew us off completely. There are 2 other tables being occupied, the manager comes outside and greets the couple next to us and asks how their evening is and if everything is alright, they chat for about a minute. He then proceeds to pass our table and goes to the next table and asks them the same questions, they chat a little longer, wait.. here comes the big issue.. the manager looks at me and my group with a look of disgust, turns and walks back inside! WTF!! seriously?!  We paid for our food like everyone else in this place, why not ask us, how our food is? I did not want to make a big deal because I don't want the girls to feel uncomfortable, but the manager continues to stare at us from inside, but never came out again.  My husband had to go to the front counter to ask for a to-go box and to refill our drinks. This is the first time I have ever felt so little in my life! Need less to say we did not leave a tip and i felt horrible, but like my husband said, since we were invisible to the waitress, she got an invisible tip too! She did nothing for us, not one word to us for the hour we were there.  I hate to tell my daughter that we will not be going back, because, us being Mexican, we think the food is actually delicious. I dont fel comfortable returning. I was really hoping that is was not a racial issue (we are a biracial family) because this is the first time i had seen that certain manager and we were treated like crap.. but after reading some of the other reviews, they pick and choose who gets good service :(  I will not recommend this place to anyone again. Good food, horrible service by those 2 who worked on 11/6/15.",

While I love the taste of Gardein products I do not do well with soy therefore usually just stick with veggies. Hussongs is happy to accomodate! My husband loves their margaritas. It's always a treat to go to a restaurant that understands and accomodates vegan options and even more of a treat to have an entire section of a menu designed for it!  They even have vegan choices on their happy hour menu! Service can be a little inconsistent. Depending on the crowd at the restaurant, the servers can seem overly busy and a bit overwhelmed and other days they are more laid back. Overall, the servers are always friendly and even if a mistake is made they are happy to fix it promptly.  We will be back again and again.",

She didn't offer to wipe my purse or offer to give me a towel to dry myself up. I had to ask for one. And to top it off, charged me for it!!! Good job bartender!!

First when I walked in I stood there waiting for someone to say Hi or even notice I was there but that did not happen. Asked the lady standing there too if she could seat me and she laughed and said she was hoping I could do that as she was a customer too. Finally saw the sign to go to the counter and headed that way.  Server at counter said Hi then I asked her to explain this concept and she did. Somewhat I got from her was basically this is a cafeteria  with a bar. You order from service counter then get a long stick with a number of  it and then go sit down. Some drinks come from  the bar and some they give you before you leave the counter where you also pay before you leave there. Sat at the bar and bartender served my beer then the counter person brought our food out on a tray and took long stick with number. Really felt very cafeteria  style  and had ordered the steak nachos. Not the worse I have had but then again not the best. While at bar I kept noticing how people kept walking in and just looking lost like I did.  Probably will not returned as the experience was not anything worth a second visit. The concept is not what I would describe friendly,  warm or even welcoming.",

Ribeye taco was dry this is their version of carne asada. We also had the mango habanero guacamole. The flavor had no hints of mango taste like regular guacamole. The rest of the tacos were greasy overpriced and had little seasoning. The restaurant is known for inventing the original margarita, so I thought I'd give it a try. They definitely want to charge you for the history and a margarita was quite underwhelming. Now onto the service. Number one, the manager never checked to see if our food was any good and asked us if this was our first time, Which replied yes it was. The order taker thinks speed equates to service my wife and I could not understand a thing that was coming out of her mouth. The food expediter didn't explain one taco and placed my wife's napkin in the guacamole and just walked off. Please do not waste your time with this restaurant.",

Hussongs offers a bunch of unique and delicious taco fillings... the Kung Pao shrimp, Pork belly and rib eye tacos are all great.  I just tried the enchiladas off their new expanded menu... awesome with the half n half cheese and red sauce.   Service is friendly, food is tasty, digs are casual.",

It was my brother and my best friends birthday, and they overheard us talking about it and brought out some birthday desserts. Very nice of them! Aside from that, our food was delicious and the drinks were just as good. I ordered a giant margarita to share with my boyfriend, and it was great. I wish I could remember our server's name, so I could give him a shout out. Great service!",

For my main entree I ordered one salmon and one vegetarian taco. Unfortunately they came out cold and weren't bursting with flavor but I was hungry so I didn't say anything about it. My boyfriend had ordered the ensaladas and his edge cold as well, so he let out server know. Our server kindly took them and heated them up for him in the oven and when they came out they were perfect! Our server was very attentive an on his A game with making sure we always had what we needed without being too overbearing. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try some of their delicious looking drinks on their menu.",

Boca Park was so many extraordinary restaurants. The menu was dynamic with a huge selection of flavor, a little history about the founder of the cantina, and menu for vegans that I rarely see when eating at restaurants. Tuesday - I got very lucky to discover Hussong's on Tuesday, because they had a Taco Tuesday Special, so all of our friends were buying drinks and tacos for each other while watching TV. Spicy tacos, shredded beef, steak, chicken, mild salsa, fresh ingredients, roasted pork.   Publisher, Thomas Chee",

The food is good especially the chips and pineapple salsa. The reason I am giving the Boca Park location 2 stars is because of service. Like I said we go often so service is mixed each time we go but lately it's getting worse. We went tonight for dinner, our waiter came and took our order and then disappeared. I drank my tea and it took someone at least 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge that my glass was empty. Our waiter still no where in site. We ordered the ceviche, guacamole, and the diablo shrimp. Along with the chips and salsa. It took at least 20 minutes to get the guacamole and my diablo shrimp was mostly cabbage. My husband who loves the ceviche said it came out warm and not a good as usual. Again we still haven't seen our actual waiter. One a positive the bus boy was doing a great job and was very personable. I had several of the wait staff including the hostess make eye contact with me as I sat there waiting with an empty glass and no guacamole. But oh well. We still love hussong's but unfortunately we may only be visiting the Strip location from now on.",

Basic tacos are $3, special happy hour drinks are $5-$7, chips and salsa is .95 and guacamole is $2.45. There are also items for happy hour on the menu. The drinks are strong but not over the top. The bottomless chips and salsa are good - you choose your salsa from a salsa bar and the guacamole is fresh and well made, but a small portion. The steak taco I had was a bit on the spicy side. The taco was decent sized, but I felt it could have a had a bit more meat. We also had a chicken quesadilla melt, which was delicious. The service was uneven. Our first server was on top of things, but we ended up having to move tables, and the second server was not very visible. Overall, the prices made up for the small issues. We will come back again for happy hour.",

There's a lot of great restaurants in this town & I can honestly say this has been THE ONLY bad restaurant we've been to...so what does that tell you?? The whole experience was terrible...starting with their salsa sauce! How do you mess that up? They do.... It's tangy & tart...I didn't taste any garlic or cilantro...very bland & tangy ...no zip to it! And for starters, they are the only place I know that charges for chips & salsa in a Mexican restaurant . It's only $1.95, but it's the principle , & their chips are aweful too! Thick & hard...I like thin & airy chips. So that's the 1st 2 things wrong. I order a frozen margarita, it comes out on the rocks, so I send it back. The guy brings it out to me frozen, but with no garnish?? Maybe they're saving their limes...who  knows, but I take the 1st sip, & my mouth started to draw up on the sides from it being so tart, so I bring it to the bar & asked the guy if he could put more triple sec in it to sweeten it up a bit & he takes the drink from my hands & goes behind the bar & puts a topper of triple sec in my drinks & hands it back to me...all with not saying 2 words to me! I stir it up, taste it, but couldn't tell a difference, so I said I need more in it. Let me drink it down a bit so you can add some more. He seemed annoyed that I was even asking, but I went to hand him my glass again, but instead he reaches down for a shot glass & fills it 1/2 full w triple sec & I said that's perfect & picked the shot glass up & walked back to my table. That's when I realized this guy has got an attitude, cause this whole process has gone on & still not one word from him! As a paying customer, he made me feel like I was a pain in the ass, but the real truth is....if they had a good bartender that knew how to make drinks, I wouldn't be bothering him to fix this drink that sucks, cause my drink would be spot on!  Next, we order our food...Dom & I both order cheese enchiladas. I ordered mine w extra cheese & green sauce. I ask our server what kind of cheese do you have...cheddar, Jack ? She says no we don't have either of those...we use this Mexican cheese blend, so I said ok, not really knowing what these enchiladas are going to look like. She walks off & Dominic says to me \"if they don't have cheese, then how are they making our cheese enchiladas\" & I said good question. I get up from the table & walk over to her as she's putting our order in & I ask her that question. She says well, it's a blend that we use & I said does it melt? Cause I like a stretchy cheese on mine & she says yea, it melts & I said ok & don't forget extra cheese on mine & she says yes I know. The meal comes out & mine looks exactly like doms...- no extra cheese, both had a drizzle of a thin white sauce on top. There is NO CHEESE AT ALL THAT WAS VISABLE....huh ? None on top of the enchiladas nor on the refried beans...NO WHERE! I  don't say anything & we both start eating & Dom says this tastes like shit & I said I was thinking the same thing...but didn't want to complain since I already started off complaining about my margarita , but when he said that , I said OMG , I was  thinking the same thing! I thought it was just me thinking this food just doesn't taste right, but we both were on the same page ! That Mexican cheese they used to make the enchiladas sucks! No cheese on top & the extra sauce I ordered (green sauce) that she charged me for...I never touched cause that too was very tart & sucked! It was so dark green, I thought maybe it was seaweed pureed ...lol , no kidding...that's their green sauce...dark & tangy! When I tell you nothing was good in this place...I mean it!!! This place is not a True authentic Mexican restaurant ...I think maybe they're from the Middle East & that's middle eastern  food or cook  we had...look at the name \"Hussong's \", maybe Asian ...whatever it is, DON'T GO! I promise you'll be disappointed just like we were! I knew something was off when I'm in a \"Mexican restaurant \" & the music that's playing is classic rock ! Where's the ambiance of being in a Mexican restaurant ? I thought I was at PT's pub for a minute .... What a joke this place is!!!!! They don't even deserve the 1 star I gave them, cause the whole place had an attitude! That place won't make it...you watch! They took over Embers space in Boca Park by the Cheesecake Factory . What a waste of $30 that was...I only wish I would have taken a pic of the food so I could have posted it here so you could see for yourselves that everything I've said is True! Neither one of us could finish  our meals, & it wasn't because we got full...because it was all we could do to eat 1/2 of it, that's how  bad it was! We both had 1/2 our meal still on our plates when we left....we just wanted to get out of there ! That was our 1st time there & our last",

Not sure if our waitress was training or not cause we saw someone shadow her a few times but if that the case I blame her trainer. It was too slow to receive the service we received.

He has a super personal demeanor and makes you totally feel like you've known him forever. I don't give too many great compliments like this on restaurants because customer service seems dead most places, but I had to get on and rave about the food, the salsas and the team that was there tonight. You all rock! Oh and to top it off, there was random live music, which made me love this place even more! I'll be back!",

We're from Santa Fe, New Mexico where there is so much good Mexican food and I think Hussongs offers top notch quality Mexican fare, service and a welcoming casual atmosphere.  We usually go there for dinner and sit at the bar where Matt the bartender pours the best Margaritas in town and meets our every need no matter how busy it gets.   Last week I ordered the rib eye fajitas ( they will make it Paleo friendly for you if you ask) and that is so far my favorite dish.  I also recommend any of the tacos, especially the pork belly.  The Ceviche.... best I've had in the city. The quality of food and service makes it our top choice for dining out at least once a week if not more.",

We sat there and in 20 min all we got was chips and salsa. No one asked us for our drink order nor did they even give us a menu to browse. They were moderately busy, but if they can't handle the amount of people in the restaurant during that time, I'd ask their management to reevaluate the amount of people they have working during that time. I've gone on previous occasions in the morning and that team gave excellent customer service. It was really disappointing as this was the first time the people I was with had gone and I had hyped up the place only to have this happen. Even as we left, no one asked us why we were leaving or if we were okay. So annoying! Don't think we'll be back!",

Not so sure...I like the fact that the owner reads these comments and cares. Kudos for that, now do something about it. It takes the same energy to cool good food as it takes to cook mediocre food.

The menu looked cheap even though when you order 5$ guac you don't even get a full avocado and wasn't even that good.. It was so small. I rly like the fire salsa tho. We didn't even have any napkins in our holder. There wasn't enough people on sad or they are just lazy. I gave the two stars for the salsa and one because the girl was nice....

Great bar and alcohol selections.  Parking can be tricky.",

Their happy hour isn't bad. The portions are full sized. I was expecting small street tacos so I ordered 3.. 2 was enough. The tacos were pretty good-- definitely on the more TexMex meets new America side. I think I liked the chicken taco best. Their pinapple salsa is very good as is their free chips.  The place gets a little warm inside since it's an open space that connects to their patio. Also, it looks like you can walk straight in and order To Go from a counter in the back. The space is fairly small so it would be a little difficult to accomodate a large group together.",

Not an authentic Mexican cantina. The waitresses were friendly but short of awesome. Amanda are server was great at refilling our drinks and keeping us with food in front of us.   The steak tacos had to be some of the worst tacos I've ever had. The shell was that awkward in between.. Was it hard? Was it soft? It was like a soft tortilla was half way fried. Not good. The fillings were minimal. The Barbacoa filling was delicious but again the shell Was confusing.   Salsa was normal, nothing super tasty. Chicken quesadilla was amazing. The aioli inside was chipotle. Tangy goodness. Margarita was good too but it wasn't out of the ordinary since it was a margarita mix. The Elote was good but I've had better on street corners. There just wasn't enough sauces on it to balance the char. Good but not great. Pretty good price wise since it was free when you check in on Yelp.   The prices are affordable here, especially since Sunday all day is happy Hour specials. Also, Monday through Friday is happy hour 3-6. I would only come back for happy Hour.",

I tried one each of the carnitas, barbacoa and chicken taco. Loved the pickled onions and the guac on the side. The guac had big chunks of avocado and tons of flavor. Spicy!   Big kudos to the bartender, Elizabeth, and the manager, Fabian. They were on point and really went the extra mile to serve. Gracias!",

The roasted corn was compliments of the Yelp Check in and was solid...

It was fatty and chewy and flat out gross, i removed the soggy taco \"shell\" and tried to just eat the meat and it was  gross as well. I chewed as much of it as possible and spit the rest into my napkin. i lost my appetite after that.!  Come on Hussong's It's a damn taco. How do you screw up a taco.? !!!!!!! On the bright side my server was really nice, she removed it from my bill. she also notified the manager and he stated that the Carne Asada tacos were the best seller ! Really ??? if it's your best seller make it taste fucking good! Give the shell some damn life!! You should be embarrassed!  Bleh I'll probably never come back again, but maybe (out of curiosity) if it's noted somewhere that they have improved their tacos .  Hmm we'll see",

As a vegetarian, it can be challenging finding eclectic menus with lots of options and not the same dishes you get burned out on, but Hussong's offers so many different items that have come to be favorites over the last 10 years that we have been patrons. We used to go to the Hussong's at Mandalay place, but now we go to the Summerlin location, which is much closer. Same great food, cocktails, atmosphere and service we've come to love. Thank you.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum yum yummy!  Always in search for a great Mexican place, and viola! I found one!  I had dropped my dear friend off at a nearby salon and to kill time I needed to eat and was craving Mexican, I didn't know this restaurant was here as it had been a steak place prior and so I yelped and was happily surprised to find this spot..  As per usual when I find a new restaurant I always order too much food as to try and find out not only are my favorite dishes good but are the other dishes as well... I was very much surprised to find out that the food was so delicious and flavorful   Every bite tasted fresh and so mouthwatering yummy  Ok, on the order docket was  To start off was the guacamole, with chips and salsa ...now if you have read some of my other posts you will know that as my friends tease me, ice is sometimes spicy for me (ha ha) so when it said that it had jalapenos in it I asked them to not add them, the waitress informed me that they cannot remove them as the guacamole is made daily and they have already been added, however she said that the way they are added it just adds flavor not spice and she would take it off the ticket if I couldn't handle it, so I had nothing to lose but a few tears of spicy rendering if it was too much for me... I was so happily surprised.. it was not only fresh tasting but had a great lime tang to it that wasn't expected . (I have become a snob and expected table-side guacamole but that is not necessary here at all!)  Stacked quesadilla with chicken (I know you think boring huh? Nope!) soooooo deliciousness, it came with fresh pick and the guacamole! Was holy!  Chicken flautas, flour tortillas were yummy and it was cooked to perfection  The table also ordered chicken tacos, and the tray of all flavor tacos to get a sample of all And the winner was all  I normally order enchiladas but I didn't for a weird reason but instead I asked the waitress for a side sample of all enchilada sauces so I could taste and know if I would be tempted to try next time and she didn't even skip a beat and I have to say, they were not spicy just very flavorful and in my opinion I would rather taste the food with amazing flavor instead of covering with too much spice (my opinion and because I can't do spice lol)  We were tempted to order more but with my tiny tummy I only ate one slice of the quesadilla and a half of one of the flautas and a few chips and I was full.. yes there was food to go but it was even delicious later.  So worth trying and the ambience of the restaurant was so wonderful  Not a ton of tables, a great pub and food spot if your hungry for Mexican and the game is on, I highly recommend this place and it doesn't hurt that they have great margaritas as well!  Enjoy! (I was bad and didn't take pics but will when I go next time)",

My friend and I came for a late lunch and literally every item we tried we loved. Tacos , carnitas. Chicken and barbacoa it was the best we ever tasted. The pork in the carnitas were sweet and spicy #awesonesauce!.  Last but not least you just try the spicy watermelon tamarind, with habanero simple syrup on a tajin rimmed glass margarita. Can I say I wish I had the 32oz it was amazing. But this fantastic cocktail will only be here until the end of June so hurry. #hussongs, #wonderfulmeal, #happyhour. #enjoy",

We sat for at least 10 minutes before someone brought out chips and salsa but didn't take a drink order. We waited another 15 before I could get a server to take our full drink and food order. (none of these times are exaggerated I promise). Another 10 minutes and I had to ask again about our drinks. Keep in mind 3 other tables who sat after us have already gone through 2 rounds of drinks before I finally got the server to bring ours out. It's been over 40 minutes folks.   Bad management is really the issue here. Either they're understaffed to serve an 80% full house or no one knows who has what tables. I hate to badger servers because I know how hard they work but it's not asking too much to at least get a drink order taken within 10 minutes. This place isn't that big. We will probably be back but not if it's even half full.",

There were quite a few employees wandering around doing nothing, but it still took us a good 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated.   Once we were seated it took forever for our waitress to come ask if we wanted drinks and to order. We had multiple questions about the menu and she looked like a deer in headlights and could barely answer our simple questions about what came on the nachos and tacos...then we found she was incorrect in her answers when the food came. It took me over 10 minutes to get the side of sour cream I asked for after my nachos came out. By the time it finally showed up after asking for it twice my nachos were soggy. They were also the most mediocre nachos I've had. My friend asked for a cup of melted cheese or melted queso dip and we had to explain multiple times and ways to the waitress what she was asking for. She then brought a cup of shredded cheese. We gave up and asked for our checks and didn't finish our food or drinks because the food and service was so bad.",

When they say it's good for two they mean it's good to get two people drunk. 64 Oz margarita called the romance really did me in that night. It had fresh fruit in it like strawberries and mango. I had fun fishing them out.   I ordered the enchiladas. They were delicious. I had way too much food though and took most of it home. I had delicious yummy leftovers the next day. They still tasted good the next day.   I noticed a deal on yelp that we ended up not using but for those of you wanting an even better deal go for it. I felt too bad using it after the manager gave us enough chips to feed a whole other person.   Customer service was amazing and we had an amazing table and experience. Right next to the lite fountains. When the manager brought us out there he called it the bellagio fountain show. Really funny actually cause it did look like a mini fountain show.   Yes I'll be coming back here for sure",

    "text": "With so few all day Sunday Happy Hour choices my girlfriend and I decided to check out Hussong's. My girlfriend was seated at a patio table when I arrived.  She had chips and a water.  She said the hostess told her it would be about 15 minutes before a server got to her so I arrived in that 15 minute window and still no server. After about 10 additional minutes and making eye contact with what appeared to be a couple servers on the patio still nothing.  I flagged someone down and asked if we could place a drink order.  She said who's your server, and we responded we did not have one to which she responded, how did you get the chips then. I mean why are we being questioned how chips appeared on our table.  So needless to say it didn't start off too well.  So this person became our server by default.  According to my receipt her name was Jasmine.    We ordered tacos, quesadilla, guacamole and queso, which was free via Yelp check in. The guacamole was good but I was not a fan of the queso and would not order it again even for free.  I enjoyed the frozen swirl margarita which is the traditional margarita with flavor of choice mixed in.  I tried the raspberry and strawberry.   I like the salsa bar choices versus most restaurants that offer spicy or mild.    During our time there two parties had dogs so the patio is dog friendly and I am a fan of that.  Overall, I was not a fan of the initial slow service but once Jasmine became our server we didn't have any other issues and she was helpful making recommendations.  This is a chain restaurant so the food is not mind blowing but add in the drinks and it's a decent happy hour option.",

I really wanted to like this place. I ordered delivery (through Eat24) Craving pozole I ordered 2 bowls, assuming they were small because of the price. But not THAT small. Didn't even fill up a coffee cup.  It didn't taste fresh (granted it was 8pm so it was prob sitting all day. They put the cabbage in the soup instead of serving it on the side so it was wilted and had no flavor. Also ordered ceviche and chips and salsa. Ceviche was great.. bag of chips was huge and the salsa wasn't included. Not sure if the driver didn't check or if the restaurant left it out but the while experience was wet disappointing.",

Drinks are always on point, with no mixers on their margaritas. Most other cocktails can be made, just remember tequila as the main, and you will probably be able to get it.  I have had a few late nite visits, and to be honest the food wasn't always the freshest. Not the worst for drinking food, but also not as fresh as their happy/dinner hour.  Staff always pleasant and accommodating, even late at nite, a plus.   A few changes at the front, thinking new management? If so, keep up the consistency in the kitchen, and your late nites should be more profitable.",

We weren't really quite sure about the salsa bar until much later after we got seated.   My friend is vegan and she specifically said vegan. The waitress comes out with the vegetarian salad which my friend ordered and had dairy on it-yogurt (the waitress should have mentioned about dairy). As a waitress, you should know the menu and know the difference between vegan and vegetarian. As soon as my friend got her salad she asked what the dressing was and the waitress didn't know. She went back to the kitchen to ask.   Then, my dish was wrong. I ordered Baja shrimp and I got carne asada. Whole order already messed up. I feel like the waitress was paying attention more to the guys at the bar than us-it was pretty slow in there.   I gave it two stars because the shrimp was ok. I wouldn't come back again because Del taco tastes much better, lol. And I'm all about cuisine and not fast food.",

The bartender told my husband she would ring up one of his drinks with the Happy Hour price and once she found out we were using the coupon she changed the price without even telling us. My husband had the fajitas and they gave him 3 stall flour tortillas. Then when he asked for more they were going to charge him $2 for 3 more (the bartender said she would take that off (THANKS!).

The menu is a bit strange in its format, but once you figure it out it is fine. It is divided into protein, style, sauces, etc that you basically \"build your own\" - I did a simple fish tacos, my friend did a pork rice bowl. You get the idea. They are all $9.95 (with upgrade options)  The food was good. I think I liked my tacos better than my friend liked his rice bowl. The endless salsa bar was a great addition. They had some awesome flavors available, from super hot to smokey roasted. The salsas helped kick up the flavor!  Service was surprisingly attentive. Even though it was clear that our server was running around helping a very busy dining room. Really, she was hustling that room, and doing a great job in the process!  Overall, it was good. I would go back because it is close and I like Boca Mall shops. If it was opposite side of the city, not sure I would venture just for this.",

The feel of this bar is genuine and makes you feel at home. Shout out to Brian Mangino the director of Operations he really knows what Excellent Customer Service is. Brian and his team made our visit very enjoyable the minute we sat down at the bar. Give this establishment a try you won't regret it!!!!",

    "text": "First time here and they were definitely under staff, however the hostess who was also the bartender, waitress, busser, and manager made up for it. Elizabeth was amazing & very attentive. She was very prompt with our drink orders and recommended items off of the menu. We were mainly here for happy hour but did try the bean dip and salsas, which were good. My cousin had a carnitas taco and she said it was fantastic. I will definitely come back and try their food. If you are looking for happy hour I highly recommend to come here, they have great drink specials and food.",

A cantina that can't get the beer right?  Their quality control is lacking, they are in a premium location .    We didn't eat, but please review previous yelper's reviews where the health department gave the restaurant multiple demerits--",

    "text": "Recently went to the Boca Park cantina hoping to find a good Mexican Restaurant.  Sorry, folks, but we ended up  so disappointed.  We arrived right at noon and were the first people to be seated, and after 30 minutes (and three other parties having arrived AND been served) we were still waiting for our orders.  When they finally did arrive (after a comment to our server) the tacos that my husband ordered were cold and, being a retired Food Service guy, mentioned it said server.  They took the tacos back, evidently put them in MORE oil and  brought them back.  They were so oily that oil was literally dripping off of them and he couldn't even eat them.  My meal was O.K., but nothing to write home about, and the other meal at the table was passable.  I learned to cook while living in Mexico and nothing that we ordered would have taken 30 minutes to prepare.  Consequently, we have not found our \"good Mexican\" place to eat yet.",
