    "text": "Overpriced Americanized \"Korean\" BBQ. For over $100 I would expect charcoal grilling and at least some ssangchu but instead they cook it over a gas range and give some chopped up lettuce to save cost. I guess for Americans its good but for a Korean like me who can get better tasting BBQ for less than $40 back in Korea its really not worth it. I rather buy some raw beef, make my own marinade and cook my own at home.",

    "text": "Where should I start? Well I guess the beginning would be nice. As we walked in, we were greeted immediately. I am one who appreciates and values great customer service. After being asked how many in our party, we were taken to our seats. As we were seated, our waitress asked us what she could get for us to drink. After ordering our drinks all our wonderful side dishes started arriving immediately. Wonderful, beautiful and delicious banchan!!! My husband and I decided on the 2 persons beef and pork meal. Which came with a side of vegetable skewer, cheese fondue, gyeran Jjim (steamed egg), and a choice of soup. Which my husband and I decided on doenjang-Jjigae (Korean soy bean stew)... absolutely delicious! Then our waitress fired up the grill and the next think I knew, she came out with a wonderful beautiful plate of beef brisket. This plate was gorgeous! You could see the beautiful marbles of fat through out the meat. Grilled to perfection dipped in some wonderful sauces made my mouth very happy!! As soon as we were finishing up our brisket, our waitress started on our next plate of meat. Rib fingers, can we say OMG!! First time ever having these (never even knew they existed). Next round was our beef belly (delicious also). Boneless short rib was next on the agenda and we finished off with the pork bulgogi. We were in meat heaven! If I could give this place more stars, I would. Needless to say, we will definitely be back (soon)!",

Ordered a couple beverages I was there alone. Ordered a combo and it was a lot of food enough I could warm up In my condo and eat the next day before taking off. The flavor for everything was amazing. The service was also great. Would recommend to anyone just like I was recommended. Used to go to DJK and Hobak they are good but not like 8 ounce. Be back soon and greatly appreciate the great service as I was in late also.",

I ordered a la carte cuz my family and I ONLY like marinated meats, so we ordered 3 Beef  ( Beef Marinated Short Ribs $35 each) it's enough to feed 3 adults and 2 small  ..  I love this place much more then Hobak, it's spacious, clean, contemporary and most importantly the tables are big enough for 5 of us to eat(w all the side dishes).  The 2 types of salad  is very good, one is the common shredded onion w soy sesame dressing and the other one is w creamy dressing which I like!  I tried the marinated beef bulgogi and it was just alright, small amount for $30 and lack in flavor.!!  Twice we've been here for dinner and the place is empty, around 3 tables.  Maybe that's y the service is superb.. hehe!!  I'm definitely coming back here again and again..",

It's not AYCE but the quality of the meats are why you come here. You'll leave just as full if you order the right dishes. We had a party of 7. We ordered the large beef and large pork combos. It comes with a bunch of ban chan dishes, rice, kim chee stew, cheese, tofu soup, and more. The meats we had so many different cuts from the short rib, brisket, pork jowl, pork belly, skirt steak... my goodness I now remember how full I was after the meal. We didn't finish all our meats cause we were stuffed. Along with some soju and beer that destroyed us. We ended the meal with this interested shaved ice desert. The matcha and chocolate flavored ones. A must order. It comes out in a martini glass. So addicting that I kept putting more in my mouth when my stomach was saying no.  Recommendation: Get the beef large combo for a group of 4. Don't forget dessert!",

    "text": "I often decide to try a place based on 4-5 stars and then I read the negative reviews before going to see if they fixed their issues.. Our personal experience for a party of 6 at 5pm on a weekday was excellent. The service was well paced, the food quality was excellent, the side dishes were always filled, the water was refilled promptly, and the pitchers of beer were nice and cold. I thought for sure there would not be enough food especially since they recommended we only order 2 of the 2 person combos even though we were are party of 6. I was fully prepared to add more food. We were pleasantly surprised that there was the perfect amount of food especially with the extras that came with each combo. The steamed egg and tofu soup that came with the combo were yummy. I've had better kimchi pancakes, but it was still a nice extra. The person cooking the meats for us was very attentive and cooked everything nicely. As she cooked, she kept an eye out for getting our side dishes refilled. She told us which meat she was cooking each time.  The variety of side dishes were great. The seasonings on the beef and pork were not overwhelming since there was no need to hide poor quality meat like some places. I didn't have to drink a ton of water like the cheap places that season heavily. The presentation of the single person dessert (kind of a snow ice) in a martini glass was cute but $7.50 is a little steep.  It tasted pretty good though.. We made reservations and it was great to walk in with the table set up with all the sides already on the table. The range hoods were not super loud and worked as best as any of the bbq places can. Yes it's a little pricey but we felt it was worth it. Maybe because it was not busy or maybe we lucked out with our server, but we had great service. A lot of people like Hobak, but we had terrible service there and we didn't like the sides at Hobak. The quality of the meat is the same.",

I've eaten a lot of good Korean BBQ and there are plenty with great cuts of meat and clever and indulgent side items (like scrambled eggs cooked in meat fat and juices) but I thought 8oz was one of the best Korean BBQ because of the one thing that's close to my heart. It had the best meat cookery of any place I've been to. Each piece of meat was perfectly cooked and expertly cut. At the end of the day, with burgers and steaks, I'm not so much concerned about all the gimmicky frills, I just want my meat perfectly seasoned, cooked, and presented. All of which 8oz nailed. As a side bonus, which really doesn't move the needle much when rating a place, but I thought they had a great list of beers on tap. And they all went great with the food.",

Since they have provided genuine services, we ended up paying 125 at the end. Food was great, atmosphere is not as loud as other competitor.  And I heard that they will have the special promotion that will be going on from Thurs - Saturday 10PM - 2AM, and the check will come out to be half off at the end. Maybe should plan to come here again for those time period.",

The staff there is friendly and let us know what type of meat was being cooked at the moment. We ordered two combos: one beef and one pork. The beef combo included beef brisket, marinated short rib (our favorite of the beef dishes) and seasoned boneless short ribs which was a close second. The pork combo included pork bulgogi premium pork belly (our favorite), pork collar and pork jowl. The servings were very generous and thought the menu says it's good for 2 people, we found it to be more than enough for 3. The side dishes were also very good. The stews that came with the combos (one kimchi and one soybean paste) were well seasoned and the variety in the side dishes went well with all types of meats. I definitely recommend this restaurant for an experience that is not like the run of the mill  casino restaurant.",

The variety of banchan here was a lot bigger than at other Korean BBQ places I've been to in town and they were all really good in flavors. My friends and I had the beef combo. The meat was fresh but the flavor/marinate could be improved. The service was great; they kept coming back to check on us and immediately provided everything we asked for. The prices of their BBQ combos are also reasonable. All in all, I give this place 4 stars, would definitely come back and strongly recommend you to give it a try.",

Being Korean American, it's my humble opinion that this is the best Korean BBQ experience in Las Vegas. We sprung for the Kobe beef which was buttery and delicious!! Obviously because of the price it'll be a once in awhile thing but the bulgogi was also soooo good. Kimchijeon (kimchi pancake), gyeran-jjim (steamed egg), and soondubu (kimchi tofu stew) were delicious as well and of course the banchan was amazing as well. We will be back for sure! Maybe next weekend again :) Thank you so much for the wonderful food and customer service!!!",

    "text": "8oz is my new go to for Korean bbq for group nights out, dates, special occasions, etc.  The food and service was at a level I haven't come across before at a Korean bbq restaurant..  Service: The server assigned to us was great from beginning to end.  Dishes were brought out timely and he cooked all courses of our package beef combo perfectly.  He would slice the meat and lay it out of on the grill individually for everyone dining.  Edged parts of the beef that were flamed to black were trimmed off to ensure we were eating the best parts. This attention to detail was evident in the service throughout the night.  VIP service at your table is what it felt like.  Korean BBQ & Banchan/side dishes: Typical Banchan offerings were all fresh and tasty.  The opening salads were especially fresh, and the Kimchee tofu soup and the steamed egg were my favs.  The package beef combo portions we ordered for 4 people was great.  The brisket and the beef short rib is the best I've had in Vegas so far, bold statement I'll stick by.  The quality of meat is evident in the taste and it's a great dining experience  Ambiance: I really appreciated the size of the tables as there was plenty of room for all the numerous dishes that typically pile up quickly at Korean bbq.   The dining area is very spacious, and has a high end industrial styled contemporary upscale vibe.  Lots of brick walls, wood and contemporary lighting. It's definitely upscale enough but comfortable. Think 'business' casual. =)  The fully stocked bar is attractive and the cool lighted \"8\" sign on the wall screams for social media attention.  This is a classy place to kick back some Korean BBQ with your friends for the evening.  8oz is my current Vegas Valley Korean bbq restaurant champ for the evenings.  The pics are great, but 8oz is definitely better in person.  No catfishing here. lol Enjoy yourself..it's a celebration =)",

What makes this restaurant stand out from the rest is the service. Your server will be grilling all your meat for you as they do at all the higher end korean BBQ restaurants but the difference here is they actually know how to grill your meat. Restaurants like Hobak and Magal are good but the servers don't actually know what they're doing and you have about 2-3 different servers that keep coming over to flip the meat constantly and ruin the texture and tenderness. You don't have to worry about that here. You're getting the best meat, service, and flavor.",

Alsobhave soju, beers and other alcoholic drinks from the bar. I decided to order the Beef Bimbimbap on hot stone $11. My husband ordered the combo Kalbi and Tofu Soup $14. Our dishes were presented beautifully, great details and of course, they were all delicious. They also gave 12 different side dishes with the meal! How generous. Fresh kimchi, fish cake, some vegetables, spicy octopus, seaweed salad, mashed potatoes, shredded marinated beef and Korean omelete.   The server took good care of us right from the beginning and recommended some dishes to us to try. He also made sure our water and tea were always topped up!

I do wish they have lunch special available on Saturday and Sunday since this is a 24 hours city and many people here work on the weekends; I am sure they will appreciate Lunch Special.   They offered to pack my leftover for me to take home along with the additional side dishes. Overall, a wonderful experience we had here.   Food was a 5 stars quality and definitely one on our list to keep coming back to.  Update 10/7/2017: we tried their package beef combo and it was worth it! It comes with: Beef Brisket, Prime ribe with bone in, tofu soup, steam egg in hot pot, salad, veggies, couple side dishes including kimchi and rice. The beef was fresh, delicately cut and cooked perfectly. Kimchi was also fresh. All for $59 and plenty of food for 2 persons. Superb service. 5 stars rating all across.",

    "text": "Service:  5 stars Treated my friend and I like royalty.  Very attentive and made sure we were beyond satisfied.   Complimentary dessert as well.    Taste:  5 stars  A5 Kobe was like butter.  Worth every penny.    Every single meat was tender,  juicy and not over powered with flavor.  Perfect balance.  All the meats we ordered,  which were brisket,  galbi,  salted rib, and the A5 were Marbleous!! The complimentary dessert was as amazing as the kobe beef. Do not skip it.  Unlike any shaved ice you've ever had.  It was light,  flavor and refreshing.    Price:  5 stars  Worth every penny.  Considering we ordered the kobe,  it was a bit on the high end but like I said.  Worth it!  Even if we didn't order the kobe beef.  The quality of the meats really are a standout and a highlight of this place.  I'd rather pay the extra dime for the high quality meat this place has to offer than cheap quality from an all you can eat.  Portion size:  5 stars  We ordered the beef combo for 4 and replaced the rib eye with the kobe beef.  The serving sizes are very generous and are more than enough to satisfy a party of 4.  Overall : 5 stars  Final word:  Best damn Korean BBQ I  ever had in Las Vegas and I've eat at a lot of places.  Do yourself a favor and skip the all you can eat.  Go to 8oz and truly enjoy what Korean bbq should taste like.  8oz has just set a new standard in all around service and quality.   Don't miss out on this amazing experience.  It's worth it!!",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 8 and made reservations on a Thursday night.  This restaurant is tucked in a hidden location in a quiet plaza in chinatown.  The decor inside is really nice and new.  What sucked about our table was that even though we reserved for 8 people, they gave us a table for 6 and another table for 4.  We couldn't all sit together because we can't move the tables with the grills.    We ordered a large beef combo, a small beef combo, 2 orders of japchae, 3 orders of kimchi fried rice and an additional order of pork belly.  The food came out relatively quickly and our server did most of the cooking for us.  The large beef combo came with beef brisket, a rib-eye steak, bulgogi and marinated short rib.  The short rib was really flavorful and tender.  The steak was well marbled and was extremely juicy as well.  everything we had was delicious.  The japchae had tons of veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly.  The kimchi fried rice was a little bland.  It could have used more flavor or ingredients.    What sucked about our meal was that they didn't know how to split our order evenly between the two tables.  The table of 2 got the small beef combo which is meant for 2 people, and the table of 6 got the large combo meant for 3-4 people.  The food ratio was all wrong and we ended up having to share food amongst the two tables.  It wasn't a huge deal but the restaurant could have done a better job and separating the portions.",

The Bon chan has a variety from kimchi, pickled radish, potato salad, salad, pickled dikon, and seasoned tofu. Condiments contain season salt, jalapeno soy sauce, and hot siracha. We had a party of five and ordered the three person combination along with a side of the spicy chicken and prawns. Meat was sliced thin, we had brisket pork bulgogi, Kalbi chicken and large prawns. The waiter cooks and cut the proteins over the barbecue for you which is great. The menu has a variety of cocktails wine and beer and soju. Portions are large and combinations are the best value because it comes with tofu soup, a savory egg dish. Very energetic environment servers are helpful and plenty of side dishes to make you full. Dessert menu is limited but we had the chocolate snow - light and delicious!",

I came here to eat the dessert and the place closes at 2 am!! I will never come back. I paid $81 for this meal, and that always included dessert. Because I have been a loyal customer that always comes back, knowing I'll be finishing my meal with a nice shaved ice. They should have offered it next time, or at least knew how to fix the problem. Servers need to be taught customer service.",

You get to choose a combo and it's marked with people figures to note how many people it feeds. We decided to go with Combo L. As usual, we got the banchan and we got to choose the type of soup. We ended up getting the tofu soup and that was probably one of the best tofu soups I've ever had! My favorite meat had to be the Kalbi but it was cool to see a whole ribeye grilled over the flame tabletop! Food was delish and they even provided a chocolate shaved ice dessert. If you want something different from the traditional Korean bbq, definitely check this place out!",

I was somewhat disappointed the first time I came because the cut of the meat was pretty thin, soup tasted salty, and service wasn't the best. Plus, coming from LA, quarters (similar vibe) is my fav kbbq restaurant. However, I decided to give it a second chance since I did come during their soft opening. My second experience was much more smooth and the cuts changed a lot (still wish the pork belly was a little bit thicker)! The soup and steamed egg were tasty too. They offered us a complimentary snow shaved ice which was better than expected. I believe if you order the combo, the dessert is provided? The owner was really sweet too.

We do not go for the all you can eat, prefer to spend a little more time enjoying our surroundings and good quality of food. First off, this spot is beautiful!! The owners spared no expense on the beauty and ambience here! Dark, yet lots of good lighting, high beamed ceilings, industrial with a warm feeling. Very pleasant inside. Our many complimentary condiments came right away, and we could have gotten full on just the pickles, salad, fish cakes, potato salad- yum! Our server, Trustin was dreamy. He was so attentive and smiling and very passionate about the restaurant and the food! We ordered the Brisket and the Soy Garlic chicken. Having lived in Austin TX for four years- I know good brisket! So thinly sliced and lovingly arranged, came out within 5 minutes. Trustin prepared the meat to perfection, and we enjoyed it so much with the different sauces we had to choose from (didn't even need sauce) Next came the chicken, which Trustin again prepared, and explained how the meats were prepared and answered any questions we had while he was serving us. The chicken was delicious as well as very tender and juicy, which is becoming a problem with chicken these days... I rarely order it as usually it is tough and overcooked. A couple last things fresh in my mind still about 8 oz- we got to meet one of the owners, TK Kim. He was so friendly, and great to chat with! Oh, and the desserts here!! We usually do not have room, but Trustin suggested I think it was Korean Frozen ice cream? It was unbelievable!! Please try it when you come here!! One last thing- as the last reviewer mentioned- 8 Oz has no awful smoke and grease stench, and they have a great wine selection and full bar :) :)",

About its meat itself, it is really fresh and the servers look so professional. Actually they are!!! The server for my table, Jackson, is really friendly and the best at bbq.

You can select different meal courses, which can be beef, pork, or a combination of both. Went here with my girlfriend, and we tried almost all of the sides. The Korean pancake, the steamed egg, Korean tacos, and the kimchi fried rice were amazing! They also have a dessert (not named yet) which includes shaved ice with coconut flakes, milk, and chocolate shavings. A great way to finish dinner!",

I went for lunch and it wasn't that busy, but nevertheless the service still felt great. I had the lunch combo that came with tofu soup and marinated beef. Oh man, both was really good! The food just tasted so clean, and the fact that I got cook my own meat, that was a plus because I wanted my meat more medium. It's definitely worth the price for more quality meat",

Food is really good , but there were somethings that make me choose Hobak over this place. First thing is that I wish the servers would ask us how we would like our meat cooked , 2nd I felt like we were being rushed a little bit because the servers were so quick to cook all our food before we can even get halfway done with the first round of meat, 3rd it didn't come with dessert! The staff wasn't rude or anything though & like I said the food wasn't bad. Hopefully next time I come back they'll fix those little things.",

Here's where the mistakes were made. We all wanted to pay separate bills. The party next to me ordered the same thing my wife and I did. Their bill was 15 dollars more? They tried to upcharge her for an extra egg dish which came complementary with the meals. There were four orders, so 4 egg dishes came with the meal. However, they tried to argue with us and said we had only ordered 3 meals. All of us showed our receipts and they realized they were in fact in the wrong. They corrected their mistake, which was good, but initially they were questioning our complaint. The other mistake was we had to remind the waiter(s) about missing items like our tofu soup, which came late, and our rice. Only two of the group orders got their rice, the other two never did. They combined two groups on two of the grills which was a little annoying because other orders got mixed together and we couldn't tell who's meat or items belonged to which party. I'd return with a small party. Large parties, beware and take caution. Check your bill and be sure you get what you asked for.",

Very fast, nice and kept coming back to ask if we needed anything else. Can't wait to come back for dinner. There dinner combos look really good.  Just wish they would carry BROWN RICE..   5++++",

She has been a few times prier, and I once before. Anyway we get there and after they bring our drinks and sides. One of the workers cooks our brisket. We barely ate one or 2 pieces and then she pushes our meat to aside and then dumps the second meat which in turns the juices flows to our cooked meat, which makes it cross contaminated. So I tell her & manager comess and they replace all. The girl cooks our brisket again. And we start to eat. Wasn't 5minutes and she wants to start 2nd meat to cook. I say we need to eat this first. Than manager comes up a couple minutes later and ask if it was alright if they take brisket off and start second meat. I say no- my wife and I are slow eaters and it will get cold. He says ok and leaves. My wife and I look at each other and now are asking ourselfs - WHAT IS THE BIG HURRY. Why are they rushing us as now we feel. Now my wife and I are getting stress, and we lost the mood to eat. Than again the girl wants to start second meat. I tell her please we are slow eaters and want our food hot and we will let u know, thanks. She leaves and about 5mintes another worker cones that is nice and polite and finishes the cooking. But the 2 other meats he cooked we just had it to go. My wife's birthday choice dinner was ruined as we felt very rushed. So we took the food to go. Nice job 8Ounce. Keep rushing your customers and you will start to lose. Sorry, but we won't go back.",

The side dishes came out and there was plenty. Total of 13 side dishes. I love how they give you fried fish as a side dish. I love fried fish. There was so many side dishes and that was awesome. The Kalbi meat was tender and really good. The tofu soup was ok to me. They didn't have a lot of seafood in it, it was mostly tofu. My lunch combo came out to be $16. That's a bit more steep in price than other Korean places I go to for lunch. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated inside. If you want to drink their bar is very nice! So I recommend going to the bar to grab drinks here if you want. Overall it's a cozy and nice place to eat Korean but I think there can be improvements here in some area. I do have to add that their servers here are very friendly and good customer service. They make sure you have everything you want and fast. Great staff.",

    "text": "Came here after seeing that it was a new KBBQ on Yelp.  Didn't realize it was still in it's soft opening stage, but there was quite a few people in here for dinner.   Pros: - Nice decor - Reminds me of a hip, trendy KBBQ from Korea - Attentive staff - Jayden is an absolute beast.  Extremely attentive and quick to get everything we needed.  Friendly and personable as well. - Lively atmosphere - Pretty loud music and tables.  - AWESOME short ribs - Said they used Prime grade beef.  Easily the best short ribs I've tasted at a KBBQ  Cons: - Quantity of food - Compared to similar KBBQs that have popped up recently, they give the least amount of food.  If they are using Prime grade, then they are going for quality over quantity. - Crazy neighbors - Theres a place next door called Good Foot Spa.  Some crazy Chinese lady from that place chased us out of some stalls that were located in front of her establishment.  Stalls are not marked, and only after we parked, she put out some ghetto, hand painted sign that says the stalls were for their customers only.   Opinion - There are a lot of similar styled KBBQ places in Vegas now, and this place is definitely a good contender as one of the top ones.  Personally, I do feel that the lack of food would hold me back from coming back again though, even though they use a higher grade of beef that everyone else.",

We got the beef combo which started with the brisket - probably the best, juiciest beef brisket I've had.  They cooked it for you, which I usually don't like, but the service was great so I never felt like I was waiting.  The outside skirt was amazingly tender.  The final course, bulgogi was good but not standout.  The combo comes with a variety of fun dishes as well as a dessert.  The food and the service was just outstanding.  This will be our new go-to place.",

The bar, the contemporary style, all of it - and I am so stoked to see it in Vegas. We did a small combo A and a small combo B. Only thing I was a little bummed about was the lack of cheese corn but the pork jowl and Cardi B made up for it.  Its not AYCE and I am totally good with that. It's not that kind of place and it's definitely worth it. The quality of the cuts of meat were amazing. We had flank steak, brisket, kalbi and the server even cut the meat off the bone so cleanly. It's a great place to drink some soju and beer and eat some meat. My parents who are both born and raised in Korea were big fans and we enjoyed the doenjang jigae and kimchi jigae as well. The banchan and steamed egg are great too. And I CANNOT forget the cheese fondue   We will definitely be back and it's great to see places like these making their way from LA to Vegas.",

We made reservations and upon arrival our table was set, Banchan on the table and drink order taken the second we sat down. The wait staff was beyond attentive and friendly. To my surprise the Owner/Manager came to our table to ask how things were and if the location had lived up to the reviews i had mentioned when making the reservation. THEY DID AND THEN SOME! He asked if there was anything we suggested that needed improvement and I could not think of anything.   The food was delicious, the meat was high quality, banchan was plentiful and tasty, our glasses were never empty, and in the end our bellies were full and quite happy.   The restaurant is located in a busy shopping center and finding parking took a minute but was not an issue. The restaurant is very clean, industrial looking decor, just really cool spot overall.   We will be back on a regular basis and highly recommend this place!",

Maybe we should have just held out and done the wait at GyuKaku, but we were hungry so we made our way over here from the promising Yelp reviews. Welp.  The restaurant was basically empty save for one other table of 2 that was already set up and eating when we (party of 4) arrive. Despite this, service was quite intermittent and the servers looked annoyed and were not too helpful with our contemplation over the combos.   Ordered the pork and beef belly a la carte which comes as a combo with our selection of kimchi stew.   The side dishes that came along were pretty good. Not many places that I have gone to have watermelon radish and I do appreciate that.  This place is one of those fancier places where the servers monitor and do the cooking for you over your table's grill. However, I almost wish they did not. No complaints about the beef, but the pork belly was just mutilated.   The slab of pork was fairly thick and already came scored with fairly deep cuts up and down - but was still promising. Yet this already prepped meat in combination with the server's small portioning/cutting and overcooking - destroyed it. One of my friends had tried to reach for a juicer piece off to the side of the grill but was scolded by the server in how the pork was \"not done yet\". By the time I had a chance to survey this meat- it was just too done.. dry- not fatty or juicy.. just sad.  And the kimchi stew was crazy salty.",

    "text": "They do Korean steak house BBQ right.  It was my first time partaking of such fare in Las Vegas.  I did go a couple times to similar Korean barbecue establishments in New York City, but never here.  I was impressed.  The best part is the customer service.  They are highly attentive and solicitous of their diners, without being too overbearing.  The food is the next best.  The beef (the combination that we ordered) was delectable and delicately flavored.  The different side dishes really complemented the main event, and the portions were just right.  For dessert, don't miss out on the shaved chocolate ice extravaganza.  It was worth the 3 pounds more that I weighed the next day.",

He was well mannered and kind. My favorite quality of him is that he is multilingual. This is a good skill to have because so many international people visit Las Vegas.   For this Japanese tourist, I recommend going to this restaurant for a nice Korean barbecue experience. Ming would be the best server for you as well. He is able to speak some Japanese.   The quality of the meat is high, I appreciate good meat. The soy bean paste is very good with the pork belly.   This place better stay open. I only come to Las Vegas once a year. I will come back to eat here!",

    "text": "Actually heard about this place from a Buzzfeed Worth It episode so I was very excited to see that they opened up an 8oz in Vegas!   Exceptional service and the food was great. I've been here twice and my experience was positive both times.  Food - let's start with the con. With all of the KBBQ places in Vegas, you may notice a lot of them are AYCE. Well this is not one of them. You'll need to order a la carte or choose a combo.   Unfortunately they are not flexible with adjustments on these combos. I wish they'd allow changes and just have the guest pay the difference if the meat is more expensive or something. It took a bit to decide because each combo id have one portion that I didn't like or something.  Pro? Meat is very fresh because it isn't AYCE. I definitely notice the quality of meat is better. As you may expect, this comes with the caveat of premium pricing. I think the cheapest combo was around $80 but fed 3-4 people. If you're splitting amongst a group, it really isn't that bad.   Service was exceptional as I mentioned. Both times I came, staff members were attentive and helpful with the cooking and changing of grills. Water and side dish refills were happening! The first time we came during dinner time too, so the great service was happening during a busy time.  Can't remember if Buzzfeed voted this place as most \"worth it\" on the episode... but personally, I think it's worth it!",

    "text": "We visited this week for my sister's belated birthday celebration. We were able to call in a reservation for a party of 8 for dinner with no trouble, at all. When we arrived, we were seated promptly and taken to our table. The only odd part was that we were in an enclosed section with two tables - 4 guests at each table. No big though.   What was absolutely amazing was the price. I have recently been trying to transition from AYCE to higher quality a la carte restaurants. I tend to overeat at AYCE and create crazy unwanted stomach problems for myself (TMI?). Anyway, we ordered a Combo C, which comes with brisket, bulgogi, skirt steak, pork belly, and lobster or short rib (we opted for the short rib after hearing from friends that it was the better deal). This also included the usual banchan (kimchee, fish cakes, salad, potato salad, etc), kimchi pancake, cheese fondue with veggies, and choice of soup. I had a long a week, so I added a bottle of rice wine to my order. My husband and I also ordered our usual diet sodas. At the end of the meal, our half (we split with Ghia G and her husband) came to $72 WITH TAX AND TIP. And we were full, but not broke from dinner... so we were happy.   Server was very attentive. He came by often so we were rarely in need of a banchan or beverage refill. He even alerted us when the meat was ready or starting to overcook at times when we were distracted by conversation.   The interior is bright and spacious.   PRO TIP AND RELATED SIDENOTE: I walked in with hair in sock bun that was dirty AF. I probably should have watched it the day before, but I didn't knowing I was going to be immersing myself in meaty smoke soon. I also walked in wearing all black, ready for any meat stainage. However, when I walked out, I was pleased to find very minimal smoke smell. Props to their ventilation!   In short, a great time was had by all.",

    "text": "This is the second kbbq place I've tried in Vegas and I can definitely say that it is the better one compared to Hobak.  The quality of the meat, especially the brisket and the pork belly were a lot better. The brisket was amazingly juicy, the pork belly was so thick and delicious, and the spicy short rib and the kkot-sal were both very tender and flavorful.  Came here for dinner on a Thursday around 9:30PM and it was pretty crowded. They take reservations by phone so plan ahead if you have a large group.   They provide a lot of tasty side-dishes but one thing that stands out was the kimchi stew that came out with the combo! It was very VERY well-made. The soup-base was perfect! I highly recommend getting that option.  Service was amazing - I like places that cook the meat for you because then they take care of portion distribution.  Price is a bit hefty but it's vegas so deal with it.",

We came for lunch so had no problem getting a seat.  The banchan during the meal came with the typical offerings, and also included either soybean, spicy tofu, or kimchi soup.  We also got a complimentary refill on a few banchan which is nice.  And not to mention a large shaved ice for dessert.  The menu includes many meat combos all priced around the $60-90 range depending on party size.  But in my opinion, the small can serve 3 comfortably.  They also have soju for $12.75 (a little steep in my opinion), but necessary for all Korean BBQ meals.  In summary, the short rib was fantastic and a must get at 8 oz.  The portions were good and the banchan offered a few nice additions like bean sprouts and kimchi cake that you might not typically see at other BBQ joints.  Downside was the sauces weren't very spicy and the other meats were tasty but nothing crazy.  If I came back, I think I might just order the prime cuts and eat from there, because that short rib was seriously fantastic.",

The food was good, I have no complaint about that. I will give five stars for the meat quality and the side dishes; however, the service was poor. When we entered the host wasn't friendly, probably because we had a baby? Also the server was not friendly the entire time. Very disappointed with that part. We might come back and check out the difference and update my review.",

The cuts of meat were all high quality... they definitely do not try to mask the flavors with marinades and sauces.  Excellent assortment and quality of side dishes accompany the meat.   The owner was really cool and came to our table to make sure everything was good... he then offered up a few pieces of A5 Kobe!  We'll be back... and did I mention that it's not filled with grease smoke?!",

I went to 8oz with a group of friends it was about 8 of us total, we were all sat together but because of the time the space was a bit crowded and we were just a little cramped. It wasn't uncomfortable though. The tables and seats were clean and comfortable to sit at. Immediately being sat, we were asked for our drink orders and I ordered the Mai Tai. For the food we were giving an array of ban chan (Korean side dishes) including soup, kimchi, salad, and a lot of other delicious meals. When the meat came out, the server cleaned the grill, buttered it so the meat wouldn't stick, and proceeded to grill the meat for our group. It was grilled to perfection and thoroughly cooked which I prefer. The meat was seasoned perfectly and tasted amazing. I cannot wait to go back!!!!",

    "text": "UPDATE:  We brought our daughter and we were raving about this place when she came to visit us before New Year, as her favorite restaurant when visiting Vegas is Hobak.   We were disappointed with the loud music, we even asked if they can turn it down but fell on deaf ears. The women's restroom was out of soap and mentioned it on my way out to one of the employees. In my opinion, they should have checked before they opened for the day.   Lastly, the set menu does not include dessert anymore but we wanted our daughter to experience it.   It was a bit disappointing on this visit.   Hobak, move over there's a new best korean bbq in town. We got turned around looking for the place as we did not set our navigator. It's located just off of spring mountain behind a furniture store.  The decor was modern and clean,  ambiance was nice as you can actually converse while enjoying your dinner.  They have an array of selection of set menus for parties of 2 or more. The meats are tender, melts in your mouth. The flavors are undescribably good. The sides included are a variety of vegetables,  pickled radishes and of course to top it all was dessert. We did not get to take picture except for the dessert which was shaved ice with powdered chocolate on top, its a simple creation but it made a big impact.  Did I say our server David was very attentive and always had a smile on his face. My only suggestion is that,  maybe they can tell us what meat was being cooked. Also, when the lady brought the desert to our table she just set it down without saying anything. We had to ask what it was since we did not order dessert but I guess it came with the set. That's the reason for the 4 star. I think it just lacks a bit of conversation from staff to customers.   I will definitely be back sooner than later.",

    "text": "We finally had the pleasure of trying another new KOrean BBQ. Upon arriving the place very nice and intimate, the decor was nice and the set as well, the vents did their job, we didn't leave smelling like the restaurant and the good thing is they had some mints on your way out- so your able to tame your breathe lol.   As soon as we were seated we were promoted by our host/waiter he explained the menu thoroughly and even offer suggestions and explained the 8ounce reference.  You can pretty much order your portion size, 4 ounce, 8ounce, Small and large combo. The best thing is that no matter what size you order they alway give you 8oz of Brisket, which was good with me. That is my favorite cut and it alway runs out fast.   They have some yummy sides besides kimchi and soybeans.  I absolutely loved their cold soup it had a light nice tart cucumber flavor, and the deep fried zucchini was off the hook (we ordered several extras of that since it only had two) I love the flavor of the soybeans, it wasn't too spicy and it had a nice savory/spicy balance. The salad was a lovely touch, it wasn't too heavy and quite tasty. The potato salad was alway a favorite side dish of mine and I am glad they have it here, a lot of other places we go to don't serve it anymore (not like LA KBBQ) Onto to our combo, we order a small beef combo, the portion wasn't enough for 3 adults and one child.  My husband and his brother could probably eat that small combo by themselves, so we did have to order some additional dishes.  No problem!  My favorite was the Brisket- and I used this Sauce they had that came with the seafood pizza- which made my meat taste even more amazing! I will definitely order the sauce again.  The pizza was good but my husband and brother have seafood allergies. So they left it all to me, naturally I wasn't able to eat it all by myself. It was just too much, it would make a perfect appetizer to share with a group of people. My husband favorite side dish was the kimchi potato pancake, he absolutely loved it and order 2 extras!  Gotta love that all you can eat side!  Overall my experience at this location was good, my favorite place is still Hobak,m. I think l8 ounce can definitely hold its own. A lot of of their stuff did taste different, in the flavor department. I personally enjoyed 8 ounce's soybean paste soup it was less spicy and more savory (good when your starving) I did love 8 ounces dessert, Snow ice with chocolate shavings was amazing and very delicious, we had to order more because my son didn't get much since he's a slow eater and he couldn't keep up with the adults. I thought it was sweet that they brought him a small one for himself, which is awesome it definitely makes them a kid friendly restaurant.",

And it disappointed in every regard except interior design.   The best thing I ate was the bulgogi. It's been a while since I've had bulgogi. I like to leave room for other meats. This was the only exceptional thing I ate. Every other kind of meat was super chewy.   Out of all the steak places I've been (not just kbbq) this is the first time that every cut lacked tenderness. Additionally, the portions...I mean...I can understand small if the meat quality is high, but it was just small tough, chewy portions of meat.   The service was friendly and the decor was nice, but...I really don't understand why this place has 4.5 stars. By word of mouth and personal experience, I'd recommend almost any other place with four stars before this spot.",

    "text": "Another solid KBBQ joint opens in Vegas.  NOT AYCE.  It relies on its clean, contemporary decor and tasty meat offerings to win you over.  The name says it all, all portions are 8 ounces or combination of 8 ounces.  The menu is simple, beef or pork cuts, some marinated some not. No Asian delicacies, such as intestines and offal.  All can be ordered individually or for the best value, as sets that also includes some veg, egg stew, cheese fondue, and either a kimchi or soy bean stew.  Large selection of well made banchan accompanies the meal.    In general, the beef quality ranges between USDA select and choice (OBV exception for the Japanese A5 wagyu and short rib (USDA Prime).  Pork is just pork. No special breed.  Marinades tend to the sweeter side but are very good once grilled and eaten with some spicy banchan.    Top choices, the marinated big bone shortrib, boneless short ribs, and outside skirt, pork jowls and pork bellies.  Other selections are KBBQ standard.  Service is definitely a work in progress.  Take full control. Don't ask questions, place an order, let the server know you will do the cooking.  Service will improve as service conference improves.  Lunches also served. Not sampled however the menu shows the number of tofu hot pots, soups, and stone pot bibimbap all at reasonable prices ($9-$11).  It's a solid effort, but does not topple the best in the valley.  In the end, the quality and flavor of the side dishes overshadow the quality of the KBBQ.  All together it makes for an agreeable meal but carnivores and purist will beg for better quality and sourcing.    A place for KBBQ noobs and those wanting an interactive date night.",

The banchans were good and the set for 2 is way more than enough. Super attentive staff, except there were no napkins...I found some in a pile on a wall near me and grabbed them. Definitely would come here again.  The ventilation was great! I have never left a Korean bbq place without smelling like heavy smoke and you would have never known I went to one that day.  The restaurant was uber clean.  Perfect!",

I didn't expect this quality because I went to several different Korean bbq restaurants in Vegas but always disappointed by the meat quality.  And I love the atmosphere. It's very current and they have a full bar for cocktails, wines and Korean beer. Premium quality meats and every dishes were so tasty! Staffs are so kind and friendly. I definitely recommend this Restaurant to everyone I know or if anyone visits from outside of Vegas. You can also order scallops for bbq and the shaved icecream was amazing! Yum~",

I made reservations for New Years and it was phenomenal!!!  I was in Vegas again in March I literally couldn't wait to go.  It was even better.  Fast forward to April, I was in Vegas again with a large group of my golf buddies.  They flawlessly hosted our party of 20.  The rants and raves from the group continue to this day.  The decor is chic but still warm and welcoming   The things that I love about this place (in no particular order)   1. The people - beyond friendly.  Best staff in Vegas.  2. The food - mouthwatering.  The meats were fresh, perfectly prepared and in abundance.  3. The overall atmosphere  4.  The hospitality - I have been welcomed as family and treated amazingly.    Final advice:  Go.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: If you're looking for a place that provides top quality meats, awesome service, and a great atmosphere, then go to 8oz TONIGHT.   Showed up for dinner around 8pm and was surprised to see a wait to get seated, but I now understand why. The older gentleman (either the owner or a manager) who put us down on the waitlist was so kind and caring. By the way he treated all the waiting customers you could tell that he cared about them.   The restaurant itself is EXACTLY the type of atmosphere that I am always trying to eat my Korean bbq at. The outside gave me a sort of club vibe which might turn some people off, but once you get inside I promise you'll enjoy it! It's the perfect place to eat with a group of friends, but still fine for families too. Nice music selection (coming from a guy in his low 20's) that's not so loud that you're trying to talk over, but loud of enough to still enjoy it. And of course the interior is CLEAN. Not like some other bbq restaurants that feel grimy inside.   We got the large beef combo that feeds 4 for $120. Might be considered on the pricy end, but you get what you pay for! Comes with your choice of up to 4 different meats as well as other side dishes. The meat was so freaking juicy and tender. Best I've had in a while. Seasoning and marinade were on point. Also, the servers here grill for you and they cook everything to perfection exactly how you want to done. Honestly, during my trip here at Vegas I have to say that this was my favorite meal even after having gone to other fancy restaurants and buffets. Absolutely coming back here if I'm ever in town.",

I enjoyed how they explained what was good there and was being honest. I almost order Wagyu beef but they said it's not worth it. I mean wouldn't you want to order the best quality of steak???? But I've stuck with the beef.   The beef quality was good!! Now I would recommend this place to anyone who is more of a beginner at kbbq. Since you don't have to lift a finger here and they pretty much explain how everything works and cook and give you a great meal from start to finish. Thanks guys I'll be back for some Moreau",

I think it was slow because it was cinco de mayo, and who eats KBBQ at lunch ?! I DO !!   We were greeted by the hostess, and got seated quickly. Our server, Dabin was awesome! It was our first time there, she showed us recommendations, from the meats to the drinks. and we took it all. Everything was delicious! We don't cook the meat, the server does.. so I feel like it's a hard job to keep conversations with the table for a period of time, but Dabin did fantastic! It wasn't awkward at all!  One thing I didn't like was the brisket.. maybe we kept it on the fire for too long, it didn't have flavor and it was dry. It's also the thinnest meat you can get. Probably won't get that again.   I can't even remember the drinks that we had .. but it was a smooth sake and Korean beer and another beer my boyfriend got. It goes hand in hand while eating Korean food ! And the beer and sake goes well together ! They didn't have the actual beer that my boyfriend wanted.. but he liked what he had.   The dessert.. it was SNOW ICE omg !!!!!!! It was delicious ! It was flakey like snow ! I loved it ! Great item to top off the meal.    Definitely going to come back when I get the chance!",

Now I thought it was gonna be expensive but it's worth it to get the combo! For example we wanted the boneless short ribs which was for $40 vs combo comes with brisket, marinated short ribs and marinated galbi.   You also get ban Chan's which includes Kimchee, pickled radish, thinly sliced radish wraps and Korean cold soup. You also get two salads which is greens and some type of meat on top and a green onion salad. Lastly you get a choice of kimchee soup or tofu soup and egg omelet and kimchee Korean pancakes.   **FYI if you allergic to seafood don't eat the kimchee and the sauce***  Meat is great! They cook it for you and they ask how you want your meat cooked, we chose medium rare. Meat is very tender you can actually taste the quality of the meat as you chew.   For the combo S for two it does fill people for two so don't be fooled that your not going to get full because you will.   They also have happy hour menu for $39 or for $50  Overall staff is nice and friendly and they are attentive will be back soon again!",

LoL. So glad to have found this place.  It's fairly close to the strip right in the heart of Chinatown.   They've got plenty of parking so no need to worry if you're driving.  The place itself is really clean and modern. Love their ventilation system. We didn't leave the place smelling like we marinated our clothes in meat. They have several combo options depending on what kind of meat you are craving. The waitress cooked our food for us. Poor thing. She was having to go from table to take to turn the meats non stop. The meat is very flavorful. Loved it! The staff is friendly and attentive as well.   Only downers I can report is the price. It's quite pricey. Their largest combo is for 4 people. So if you're with a large party be prepared to drop a pretty penny on this food.  We were also bummed that it's not an all you can eat restaurant. The portions are kind of small even for 4 people. A small skewer of veggies was like $4. Lol! Crazy! I feel like dinner took us forever because the waitress was cooking the food instead of us. It also isn't convenient because since she was cooking we were able to specify to cook the meat a specific way.",

I never experienced the highest kind quality here in vegas until 8oz Korean Steak House opened up! Best KBBQ experience in the city!  I've been to many around town and this beats all my experiences.   Shout out to Gabby for being our server for the night. She made our experience match our expectations. First off, we told her it was our first time eating here and she went through the menu with us by recommending the Small Beef Combo good for 2 people. It was the most favored specialty by other customers. We did not wait long for our Dishes arrive and she even took the time to cook it all for us. Not only that, the meats were all cut and sorted on the grill just ready for us to dig in. What I love about the experience, is that she even made sure no meat went to wast and cut it all the way down to the bone. Service was fast, prompt, friendly and helpful.   I really recommend coming in during later hours if you want their HAPPY HOUR which starts at 10pm-2am every Thurs-Saturday! Boos, food, meats are ALL HALF OFF!! (Excluding Combos)  BUY 1, GET 1 SOJU too!!!  PRIME GRADE BEEF, REAL WAGYU, CERTIFIED BLACK ANGUS are ALL HALF OFF!! Otherwise, check out Combo menu and you decide which fits your need.",

You can tell a good quality place by trying their brisket and this place has it. You can see the freshness and the marbles on the meat. So good. I prefer beef combo but their pork is great too! Side dishes are great! Steamed eggs are one of the best and also their kimchi fried rice is bomb!  Only downfall is that their combo doesn't come with desserts but if you do order it, you won't be disappointed with their shaved ice!",

I thought if their meats are only portioned then they have better serve great customer service and their food better be good. Lol I ordered the small beef combo with brisket, short ribs, and skirt steak. With that they offer you either soy bean soup, Tofu soup, or kimchee soup, took the kimchee soup. Depending how much people are at your table they give you steamed buns! If you have three people you get three pieces, or two people you get two pieces. The sides for dinner is limited; it commonly came with kimchee, broccoli, and potato salad. Their chives salad is very good with the rice and meat. They provide multiple sauces for you. Also, their kimchee pancakes are delicious, you have to pay extra if you want more. They bring out the meat and cook it right in front of you, if there are any burnt marks they cut it off for you! They bring out a steamed egg as well for your party to enjoy. I ordered a citron sake during my first visit with friends so our total came out to $90 with tax and tip. But when I came back with my fiance with just ordering the combo my total came out to $70 with tax and tip.   Quality wise it is worth it and I get very full because of the continuous refill of our sides. If you're not a sides person and just goes straight in with the meat and rice then you won't get full - in my opinion because of the quantity of meat. However, utilize the steamed egg, soups, salads, sides, pancakes, and buns they give you beforehand to kind of fill you up! I'll be back here it's a good place, they're not as busy right now because I don't think a lot of people know about them yet.",

They need to do something else if they're going to compete in the Korean BBQ business as magal and hobak are much better - as far as price. The meat itself is comparable. Also these restaurants are open later and 8oz closes at 11pm, and honey pig which is also decent, is open 24 hours (or almost).   My friend ordered the japchae and said it was not good.   I'd give this place another chance as it still was in its \"soft opening\" (they didn't have a lot of the non BBQ dishes available).",

    "text": "Recently moved from Ktown in LA to Vegas, I've spent depressed and restless days for eating below-averaged Korean foods (compared to Ktown in LA) in Vegas.  Tang tang tang is good but not reliable for it seems like they are changing their recipes/chefs every other day.  Honey pig is rubbish for listing on dirty dining several times and I just didn't go so that my good memories from \"the Honey Pig\" in Ktown doesn't get ruined.  Hobak, it was pretty good when it comes to foods but I was afraid to dine in with my infant in a stroller. (If servers' are carrying hot soups around, then they shouldn't be half-running around on the busy floor!)  Magal, me and my wife eats about 1.75  portions total. And we were not full with their small combo and it was an average meat quality. It seemed like they are following LA location's mistake. *Sorry for the long intro lol  So, when I saw this place opened up and I saw one single review that's comparing 8 oz to those places that I didn't like, I did not want to check this place out.  But I solely came here just because from the picture, it looked huge and so that i wouldn't have to worry about making a safe zone for my baby in a stroller lol But this place has the most potential to grow and eat up competitors in the vegas market.  First of all, meat quality. My server seemed to be so proud for they are serving USDA prime lol he was saying \"we dont just serve black angus, we serve USDA prime\" lol as i ordered beef tongue i asked him if that's a prime as well (for i know that beef tongue doesnt have a usda grade, it was a tricky question ;)) he told me what i was thinking. Good knowledge , service and training! Second, marination. I usually prefer to eat beef slightly seared or sous vide and torched surface and with good salt only. It's to taste the beef meat and enjoy itself. But their marinated beef such as bulgogi and galbi are superbbb. Sweet, salty, tender, smoky (my server seared the surface and smoked bulgogi and galbi with so much effort, thanks again!), and a slight sour kick from the pickled radish wrap. It was a beef heaven! And it's not like they used low quality beef to marinate. The quality was still good as fresh beef that they served. (Didnt ask if it was a prime as well lol) Also they had soon tofu soup came with the beef combo, and I was told that they serve it as a lunch menu on weekdays, 8 oz just became my lunch place from now. *I'm writing this from my phone and I'm getting tired, i will wrap it up. :)) Their interior, branding, layouts, service, and food just tells me that it will succeed and will likely survive in the market.  Oh they also have a full bar! Didn't see a bartender i guess it's because they are on soft opening but it will be awesome to enjoy my fav whiskey while eating good rib eye. My only, the only down side was that they didnt have cold noodles available. It is a must in Kbbq! But understandable for they are still on soft opening. Oh oh and they offered military discount, i was wowed and appreciated for it was my first time receiving one at a korean restaurant. Will come back to check out their lunch menu!",

Upon entering, the decor really blows me away. Industrial with rustic undertones, the whole ambiance is very trendy and the industrial hoods that spread throughout the place rings True to the Korean BBQ theme. The food is well seasoned and get this, they serve it with cheese!!! What a game changer! Dipping your ribeye in cheese gives it a richness and zing that will have you asking yourself, Why didn't I think of that? Genius!  The servers were super attentive even cooking the meat and plating it for you. That's always a plus in my book!  The music is loud so it actually stimulates conversation and a lively atmosphere.  The owner even went to each table and greeted each of the guest. He takes his business seriously. Which is a must in this tough food industry. But with the combination of everything he has going; good food, good ambiance, good service. It's definitely a recipe for great success!",

Service: Our waiter was extremely attentive and very friendly. He was kind enough to explain any dish we were unfamiliar with. He also gave us a little bit of an insight to why the restaurant was named 8oz.   Food: The side dishes were plentiful and tasty. The flavor quality of meat is much more noticeable as opposed to other places we've tried. I especially enjoyed the miso pork belly. Yum! I'm a big fan of kimchi chigae and I was not at all disappointed.   Price: We're not to big of sticklers when it comes to paying for what we eat. If the quality is better, we expect higher pricing.

However, I really like the vibe this restaurant gives- typical Korean environment, makes the experience different to all the rising Korean restaurants.   I ordered their kkotsal. It was given in a big portion. I thought it was enough to share between two girls, considering they give different kinds of side dishes. However, unless you order a course, if you only order one meat, they do not offer any soups, which was a disappointment for me, since the portion was already enough meat for us. Also, the service was exceptionally good. Jackson was very kind and prompt with our needs.  I just wish their drink prices were a little lower since they are more expensive than most of the other places. But other than that, I loved everything. I cant wait until their bar opens and they open till late night.",

As grown up in northern and SoCal , I have been to many Korean BBQ joints in LA, like Park's, khd, quarters, and I am always around them with my Korean friends and I thought I knew Korean BBQ very well.  I couldn't believe it until I came here finally and see it with my eyes. Yes, they were right, and this restaurant takes Korean BBQ to the next level.  Food, taste, quality of meat, atmosphere, service, cleaness, music, everything is amazing. If I have to pick three things I like most, it is Quality of meat, quality of meat, and quality of meat.  Their quality of meat is amazing!!   We went vegas couple weeks ago, it was saturday night.  The restaurant is a little off the street, kinda hidden. as we entered, I was immediately knew that my friends were right.  the place was busy, greeted right away and waited for about 15 minutes for the table (Although I should have done the reservation through fb).   Cool, industrial, modern, super clean hip atmosphere.. great sound system, they even have full bar and we sat at bars until our table is ready.. (my friend didn't tell me about bar)  Our server Howon, kindly went through their menu. Their menu was very simple; beef combo, pork combo and 8oz combo.  8oz combo has beef, pork and seafood mixed.  We ordered beef combo large, it was more than enough for 4.  Food came out timely, Howon takes care of us from the start to end, he pay attention to every little details.  Amazing services, very well trained staff. He explained which one is certified Angus beef, prime and wagyu. quality of meat, again amazing.  These guys know how to marinate, prepare, display and how to cook at the table. Howon explained little things like sauces, banchan.. maybe we look very new to kbbq.. haha.. their banchan is very fresh and has lots of flavor. radish wrap, kimchee, kimchee pancake, salads.. everything way better than any kbbq I ever tried.  Manager Jay stopped by our table multiple times to make sure everything is ok.. he picked up used napkins, empty bowls, we were treated as VIP..   They gave us free dessert, chocolate shaved ice.  they said this is free as their grand opening special and for limited time only.  We will definitely come back soon. We sometimes go hobak when we come to vegas and it was just okay.. it was always excused because we are not in LA. Now we found the best korean bbq in LV and happy to share my experiences.",

    "text": "Visited this place again for a late lunch with my sister.  It was about 1:45 pm so the lunch crowd was gone and the place was empty so we had the restaurant all to ourselves.  Our server, Bora, was so pleasant and friendly.  She chatted with us while she cooked our food.  She also kept refilling the side dishes.  My favorite is the potato salad and radish.  My sister loved the fried  zucchini and tofu.  Everything was delicious.  The place is so clean and their meats are fresh and tasty.  Although the brisket doesn't have any taste to it,  dipping it in salt/pepper and sesame oil is really good.  The kalbi meat is marinated in soy sauce and other condiments.  The flavors are so tasty.  We also had the boneless short ribs (my least fave).  It was good but not as great as the kalbi or brisket.  The desert we had was amazing.  It's a must-try dessert.  It's flavored shaved ice dusted with cocoa powder and drizzled with condense milk.  Yummy!!! Overall, we were not disappointed.  This place is truly a great restaurant to go to if you're craving some Korean BBQ.  They are all so friendly.  I will return here over and over again.  Two thumbs up for this place",

Although this place is a bbq place when i called if they had any lunch menus..they said they served soft tofu soup combination that comes with a choice of meat such as L.A. Galbi. What surprised me the most was the assorted side dishes that came with it!!! 13 in total! I mean I could probably just eat the side dishes and get full..and plus the price was super cheap!!! I had a full delicious meal for such a great deal..this is the place where I will go have lunch from now on..maybe next time I'll come with some friends and try their bbq.",

    "text": "This Korean bbq restaurant is a bit pricy compared to other Korean bbq places in town. Last time I was there, me and my buddies ordered a large beef combo that included marinated short ribs, brisket, skirt steak, and rib eye steak. Their meat quality is pretty high that all these meats were soft and tender! It's very nice that they switch out the grilling pan everytime you cook different types of meat since it makes a big difference in flavors. If you eat a lot (like me...), don't expect to get full from just ordering a combo menu. You might want to order extra meat such pork belly. After we were done eating, we ordered their dessert menu which was shaved ice with shaved chocolate on top. The description might sound pretty basic but it was just sweet enough to get rid of all the greasy flavor from the meats! I would definitely come back!!",

The food was top quality and we even ordered their A-5 Kobe since it was my husband's birthday. Might as well go big or go home for these sort of events.  The place was a bit empty when we went there. There was another couple there. You choose what sort of combo you want depending on how many people you have in your party. By the way, the serving sizes are pretty big. We chose the two people option, but we were stuffed by the time we got the Kobe served to us. So, yes, the two option combo is more than enough food. Our server cooked everything for us, which got a tad awkward because it wasn't busy enough for him to keep him busy with something else. Otherwise, the place is great! Definitely will come back here again.",

Now I see that people often do not care what they eat or how they eat it as long as they are in a hip place.  Unfortunately not me, i care about the food and the way people treat me.  The waiter didn't give us the time of day, made fun of me when i asked for specific things that we often get at Korean restaurants such as Side dishes.  Then proceeded to watch me cut the fat off of all the meat we were eating. Served the meats to us when they were not even cooked throughly. Take it now I like my steak medium rare but not mooing!  The food was bland and expensive for the smallest portions of meat I've ever seen! The side dishes were non existent hence my reason for asking for them. Eyes rolled and then the help just stood by and stood... talked and stood around some more.. so being a business owner i would be pretty upset to have my employees just standing around, and just standing around some more.. thank you, will not be back for dinner. Good luck with your business.",

They did a really great job at the ambiance-it's open, comfortable and more upscale than any other Korean restaurant in Vegas. Servers are super nice and accommodating we had Songyu (think that's the spelling lol). The kitchen was super fast at bringing our food out.  Even though we ordered our food to go, we ended up deciding to stay and dine in. Songyu was really sweet and quickly switched all our food from to go containers to regular dishes. The location is a bit hidden but it's these types of places off the beaten trail that are the most delicious secrets...I'm already planning to go back next week w all my friends!",

    "text": "An absolute yes! If you've got a hankering for mean Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, give this place a gander. From their memorable service to the quality cuts of meat included in their combos, 8oz knows how to keep their customer base happy. While AYCE places certainly have their appeal, I always come out feeling like I've either overindulged or I haven't eaten enough to justify the price of AYCE. I've also become quite jaded with a lot of San Diego Korean BBQ places because either their meat quality has declined, their service is wanting, or their establishment is not up to cleanliness standards. Visiting this restaurant renewed my love of Korean BBQ and reminded me that you don't have to settle with substandard.   Myself along with two family members ordered the S Beef Combo which comes with beef brisket, galbi, and your choice between seasoned boneless short rib or grilled bulgogi. A difficult decision to make but bulgogi made the final cut. The menu was a bit tricky to understand at first, there's a lot going on and I had to take a minute or two to interpret it. You can choose to forgo the combos and order items ala carte but ordering each item individually is quite expensive (i.e. galbi is $38). This might work if you're just looking for a snack but for a full meal, it makes the most sense to order a combo. Even though the S Beef Combo is recommended for 2 people, if you're not ravenously hungry, 3 people can definitely get away with it.  With the combos, you have the option to choose one appetizer and one soup for the table. Our table was completely filled with various banchan, 2 steamed eggs/egg stews (we ordered an extra one that was not included in the combo and they comped it!) kimichi jigae and a cold radish flavored soup to cleanse the palate. The banchan selections were varied and plentiful and included fish cakes, bean sprouts, kimchi, fried squash, kimichi pancake, etc. Staff asked if we wanted the banchan refilled midway through our meal and were quick to replace our grill when necessary. I was very impressed by the various meats and their marinades. The brisket, galbi, and bulgogi were enormously flavorful and thanks to our wonderful servers who came by to help us cook, the meat came out perfectly cooked. While I don't mind cooking the meat myself, I have a tendency to overcook or even burn the thinner pieces of meat. The meat selections came with a vegetable skewer and a ramekin of cheese which eventually melted into cheesy goo. I don't like cheese with my Korean BBQ but if that's your thing, 8oz has you covered!  Overall, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're okay with a non-AYCE format, I'd recommend giving 8oz Korean Steak House a try.",

    "text": "I was so excited to come here last night. The interior and decor is very similar to Hobak (due to the same owners) except more spacious. When we were seated, the side dishes were already on the table. The side dishes were varied and there seemed to be more of them than other KBBQ places.   The service here was fantastic, and our server was very attentive from the moment we sat down. We ordered the Beef Combo which comes with Beef Brisket, Galbi, and seasoned boneless short ribs. As our server cooked the brisket, the additional side dishes came such as the Spicy Seafood (Clam) Tofu Soup- so delicious. The soup wasn't too salty, the right amount of spiciness, and came with generous amounts of clams and tofu. The steamed egg dish was fluffy, soft, and really well done. The classic korean side pancakes were not oily at all like other ones, and had the right mochi consistancy. I love the variety in all the dishes here since they all go well mixed together.   My favorite dish of the night was the Spicy Rice Cakes! The Spicy Rice Cakes here are honestly the best I've ever had since the sauce was not oily or thick or too spicy like other places. It had a yummy buffalo-type flavored sauce, and the rice cakes themselves were soft and firm.   I'm not sure if the beef brisket was overcooked, but it was more chewy and dry compared to other brisket I've had elsewhere. I also do like my meat more rare, so make sure to specify this. The next two meat courses were phenomenal such as the Galbi and the Boneless Short Ribs. These were both extra tender and juicy and sweet from the seasoning. You can tell the quality of meat here trumps other KBBQ places.   I was very impressed with the complimentary matcha shaved snow dessert that came at the end. Most places serve you shaved ice, but this was actually frozen milk that came in little soft shards of ice that melted instantly in your mouth. It was a great way to end an incredible meal.",

    "text": "I want to order 88oz every time I sit down!  Having originally been turned on to this spot by Unlokt, after a few visits over the past year, 8oz has become my go to Spring Mountain fix for KBBQ for a several reasons.   1. Almost never a wait.  Hallefuckinglujah!  I would rather eat my own eyeballs than sit for an hour plus pre-treating my clothes in bulgogi cologne prior to actually eating.  If there is a wait, unlike the other two popular places on the same street, they have a BAR!  GASP!!  Our dining party can hang indoors with alcohol and that beats the hell out of sitting on a bench (if you're lucky) staring at a bunch of strangers on their phones in 100 degree heat when the wait is too long (you know where).    2. I like the room a lot!  The lighting and clean atmosphere are great and it's spaced out well enough so you don't hear neighboring table talk.  This would be the best choice for a grill date or if you wanted to fire one of your employees (because pork belly will make them feel better after you do it) or to tell your parents that Alex is more than a friend.  The constant sound of the sizzle and jamming K-Pop cover it all up!  3. The excellent selection of banchan that I constantly request more of including their two salads.  Several meats I am a huge fan of include \"rib finger\" (I mean..who knew?), outside skirt, ribeye and anything associated with pork belly.       Is the A5 wagyu worth the splurge?  No.  At $180, the beef is of good quality, but their process for cooking it, which they do like any other piece on the menu, is multi-level wrong.  Sitting there watching the server cook it on a way too hot grill, cut it with scissors into micro pieces (kill me) and then push it to the side to move on to the next meat was like seeing a kid with a learners permit trying to drive a Ferrari.  Good beef like this needs to rest for a bit!  I had the same A5 Kagoshima wagyu the very next day at Kame and it was light years better all because of the cooking method.  It also shouldn't be advertised as Kobe beef because it isn't that.    Aside from that, I am confident about 8oz being a sure thing every time.  It is on my short list for KBBQ recommendations in Las Vegas and I'll be back pretty soon.        4.477777111129843984982 stars!!",

    "text": "I thought Hobak was the reigning heavyweight champ of KBBQ in Sin City. 8oz is a formidable competitor to Hobak but something of the food seemed as delicious if not better about 8oz. The banchan was flavourful, good options and you just ask for more and they bring you more. We ordered the beef Kalbi combo for two and it was grilled for us just perfect. Even the tough gristle near the bone was cooked well enough to provide good flavour (although a bit chewy). 8oz is full service KBBQ like Hobak and the service is top notch. The dining atmosphere is upscale here and really exceptional.   The only downside is the exhaust fans do work well but my hair absorbs that sweet soya sauce smoky flavour like a sponge. Not the restaurants fault but if you are going here for a date night keep this in mind. Better fans could be helpful.   Otherwise come and enjoy that succulent grilled meat and eat your veggies.

Very responsive. And yes she was cute !   Banchan - fair selection but what was new for me was the dongchimi. It's like a pickled clear brine. Good for digesting i guess. Reminded me a bit of naengmyun broth(cold noodle soup). They also gave some sort of salad which looked very pretty. Also some bean sprouts with green onions in a soy like sauce.  Japan kobe ribeye wagyu - ask for the price before you order so you can decide. I've been craving it and it was my bday week. So I didn't care and ordered it without price checking. It was $180 but a good deal for a whole sized ribeye. I say about 10-12oz. Bigger than what I expected and cheaper than any other place I've seen where it can be $30 an ounce. I suggest you have it cooked rare to med rare and have it left off the grill when they cut it up but eat it however you want. My friend who was with me said it taste just like steak. I told Her to just eat her kalbi! Personally I love the flavor from the fatty rich oils of an A5 or A4. Not like I have it all the time. Got to spoil yourself or try something different once in a while! I craved the rich flavors(think of foiegras if you like that) for months . Definitely satisfied ~  Kalbi korean short ribs- I dare to say this is the best I've ever had . Seasoning and flavors were excellent. Not too sweet or salty. Very tender. You can tell you're eating quality meat. I don't normally order this because it's boring but man it was good . I would get this again if I came here. Also my waitress grilled the bone nicely and put good effort into cutting out the tendon part for you to it. So delicious   by now we way over ordered because I didn't realize the Kobe ribeye was that huge but   Pork jowl - it look damn good raw and even better as it was grilling. The nice browning colors as it cooked on the outside  and the nice white marble like color of the meat itself. Tasty and tender. What else would you need ?!  Steamed egg - maybe cause we ordered it and not given free like most places.  It was full of egg and soft. Blew me away.   Kimchi stew- I forgot what stew we actually ordered by then but I tried some just to try it . It was good but I tried to focus more on the meats   Dessert - complimentary . It was shaved ice milk topping on vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup . Something like that . Looked nice and tasted okay!  I will come back here for sure to try other things like the beef finger meat ! Or well whenever I visit LV again ~  #jessteatit You either like it or you don't. You live once, might as well  try it once. Food is meant to be enjoyed. Eat it how you like !",

Decided to bring in my mom and aunt here for their first KBBQ experience. We came into the restuarant about 11pm and were welcomed in by the friendly staff. We order the combo B. The banchan selection was excellent. My favorite would have to be the thin sliced radish HANDS DOWN. The soft tofu soup was amazing and the steamed egg was a nice change of pace. Now on to the stars of the show, the meat. Now I've been to GEN and I fell in love with their beef belly...but damn. I think I just found a new beef belly that holds my heart . It was so tender and flavorful! Next they brought out the jowl. Our cook/server cooked our meats to perfect done-ness. The jowl was just how I liked it! The pork bulgolgi had a nice spice to it! Last, but definitely not least, the marinated short rib. Now I've been to alot of KBBQ in the USA and Korea. I can say this without a doubt in my mind : this marinated short rib is SPOT ON to KBBQ in Korea. If you want an authentic taste, come here! Not only did our server cooked this to absolute perfection, she even deboned it for us! I work at a KBBQ in hawaii and I must say...this was on an entirely different level. I'll DEFINITELY will be coming here on my next visit !",

My bf and I got the small beef combo ($60) and were afraid it wouldn't be enough food since we were starving, but it turned out to be a generous amount of food - so much so that we struggled to finish. My favorite meat in this combo was the short rib, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it!! It's so tender and flavorful.  All the combos also include your choice of soup and we opted for the tofu soup. I highly recommend this one! There's so much seafood in it and it was super tasty. Their steamed egg was spectacular and service was above and beyond. It's so nice not having to worry about cooking your own meat and our server cooked everything perfectly. They did also serve us dessert at the end of our meal which was this chocolate shaved ice and omgg we were scraping the plate lol, it was a nice and refreshing dessert. Oh and they do take reservations unlike many KBBQ places in town!",

My boyfriend and I ordered 2 orders of the beef belly and the quality of meat oh my....has went from 10 being the best to 1 being so yucky and chewy. We could clearly see the thin white tendon strip down every piece of meat...how disappointing they could see it too but yet they didn't have a problem serving that to their customers. And they also took the cold soup away and didn't replace it with anything else...I guess I was one of the few that liked the cold soup...oh well 2 local customers lost forever. Bye bye the good 8oz...it was great while it lasted.",

    "text": "We went to 8 oz on a Saturday afternoon and it was empty.  Which was a nice change of pace compared to all the other kbbq places with long waits.  The interior was industrial and clean.  Modern.  Reminds me of LA style kbbq places.    Service was friendly. And banchan was yummy.  My faves were the egg battered zucchini, potato salad, radish, and fish cake.   The variety was nice compared to other places.  There were also 2 types of salads that were refreshing.   We ordered the from the group menu, Menu C and added an extra order of pork belly.  Aye.  Too much food.  Granted there was 2 adults and one tween. We couldn't finish everything.  With our meal came steamed egg and choice of soup, I chose the tofu soup which was pretty tasty.    Our waitress was nice and friendly and cooked all of our food. The downside was she never told us which sauce goes with what meat like in the other reviews.  Which is fine bc I'm Korean, but still would have been nice to get the same experience.     The meats were all good, higher quality then all you can eat places. But I really couldn't say it was the best I've ever had.  I've had better in LA.  The price point was a bit high as well.     Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our meal and ate until we could pop but no complimentary desserts. And the higher price point, I don't know if I would be back?",

This place kind of reminds me of a place in Ktown LA area - Quarters, where it's a pretty trendy place that serves meat in quarter ounces. This place serves it in 8 ounces I believe.  We got the \"Beef L combo\", which came with beef brisket, marinated short rib, outside skirt, and boneless short rib. We also added an order of the pork belly.  The quality of meat here is superb. All the meats came out one by one and you can definitely taste the quality of the meat.  We also had a good amount of soju (fresh and the green grape) to go with our food.  The sides that came with the food were also tasty.  Our server,  Mario, was on top of everything.  He made sure our meats were cooked properly and that we did not go thirsty.   Overall,  I really like this place even though it's not all you can eat,  its still worth it!",

However, when I went back for a second time the flavors dropped and I felt the meat quality had also gone down a little. I'm probably crazy and making stuff up, but it wasn't the same.  Service is good though and definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the mood for KBBQ that's NOT AYCE.",

We went in a group of 12 so we got this area with 3 tables together and two grills on each end table. I thought I was odd that the middle table didn't have a grill but it was how the vents were setup. It worked pretty well any ways. They had a lot of options of groups of meats. They had sides setup for you before you even sat down. The servers were very quiet. They did all the cooking at our grills so our only job is to eat. But it was really hard to hear when the server announced the type of meat or when it was ready. They us butter to grease the grill but beware it still pops at you whether you feel it or not. My glasses were so dirty when we finished. I couldn't tell you guys what we order because I just inhaled it all. It was just so delicious. It was a really good experience.",

My family and I came here again for our Christmas Eve dinner. We cannot express how this is the best Korean Steakhouse in  town and we have been to several Korean steakhouses in Southern California so we know quality when we see/taste it!

However, I wasn't too pleased with the service.   We came here for dinner and it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a friendly hostess. We got seated and our server literally didn't even say a word to us.  He also didn't look too happy to be working there. Mind you, they had literally just opened for a week or two so I would assume they would be a little more welcoming. He didn't give us recommendations or anything, just came back after like 2 mins and asked if we were ready to order. Water wasn't given to us until way after he placed our order. He cooked really quickly and didn't give us napkins, so I asked for napkins and he literally just placed a stack in the middle of the table and ran away. I'm not really begging for excellent service but because of their price and ambiance, I would assume they would have better service than let's say a $15 AYCE KBBQ place. I don't think our server said more than 5 words to us. I wasn't paying attention to the other table he was serving, which were Koreans. I was thinking maybe language barrier he couldn't really talk to us, but it looked like he was the same way with that table.   The food wasn't bad, though. I still prefer Hobak more.",

The potato and zucchini is also good but it already comes with it regardless. This is a great place to eat with a lot of people or to catch up with someone.

    "text": "great combination platters and sides! service was great and the style of korean bbq is similar to those in los angeles, ca. my boyfriend, best friends and i came before their major grand opening, and it wasn't very busy. quality of the chadol was not as good as hobak or magal, but overall, the pork jowel and short ribs were amazing. the kimchi bokkeumbap was delicious and the sides reminded me of some of my favorite childhood dishes!   ask the server for some direction of portions! i felt like my party didn't and regretted how big some of the portions were! the price point is similar to hobak and magal in town and despite my five star rating, i can't say this spot is better than either of those.   when we got here they said the bar items were not available to the full extent yet because everything was being created still. however, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back when they have more established in terms of their bar and food menus.   only thing we didn't care for was the steamed egg and kimchicheegae because despite how much we love those two sides normally, they weren't prepared right here. the steamed egg was too dry and not fluffy at all. texture was harder and dry, lacked flavor and overall was bland. the kimcheechigae tasted lackluster too because it was way too salty with lack of much content.   they came with our combo so we just didn't care much for them... however, everything else was quite good and worth having! combos had a good blend of different choice cut meats and sides.",

Extra attentive service..  it got packed around 7.   We tried the beef combo with short rib, and spicy chicken. I can't remember the name of the 2nd beef. All the meat was tender and flavorful. We tried steamed bun beef \"tacos\".. delicious...  and tofu clam soup. Yum!!! The kimchi pancake was delicious too.   So many flavors and so many dishes to try. But the portions are not too gigantic so you don't feel terribly full... It's really a fun thing to do with your friends.   Save room for dessert! The shaved ice with chocolate .. ...mind blown!   Cool vibes inside. Super friendly team of people that work there. They are just happy to be there and happy to serve you.   A++++",

    "text": "First time coming into 8oz and my experience here was absolutely terrible and let me tell you why.   When we got to the host stand we were guided to our table and before I was about to sit there was food on the chair. While standing there and staring at the food, the host did absolutely nothing to ask what's wrong. So I had to ask him to wipe down the chair. All he did was swipe it onto the floor with his hand and walked away. We sat at the end of the chair away from the food stain because we were waiting on him to come back and wipe it with a sanitized towel but he never came back and as I'm halfway into my meal we are still sitting on the edge of our seats.   As our server came to greet us we ordered 2 drinks on their menu, he checked our IDs and went away. BY THE WAY, There was no greeting what so ever. Not even a \"Hello\" or \"how are you.\" Just straight into ordering.    He came back and told us he cannot make the drinks and we would have to wait a little bit for them to be made because the bartender was gone. So I asked to speak to the manager, hoping he can make them, who was also gone. It's ridiculous how they have a bar menu and bar seating with no one knowing how to make any of the menu drinks.  To make things simpler for us I asked to order a well cranberry vodka and how much that would cost. 5 minutes later he tells me it's $10. I said that's ridiculous and no thank you. He comes back to me a few minutes later and said \"Nvm, it's $8.\" So when I finally agreed for it to be made, he immediately says he cannot make it because he doesn't even know if they have cranberry juice. Why did you waste 10minutes of my time figuring out the price when you knew I was never going to be able to order it?   Finally, I asked the shift leader if they have any cramberry juice. He says, \"yes it's only for cocktails though. And cant be used in a mix with vodka.\" He also mentioned customers can't even purchase cranberry juice by itself. Anyway, If cranberry vodka is not a cocktail then I don't know why they even have cranberry juice in stock.  The manager finally came in at the end of the meal and he told me yes they can make cranberry vodkas and yes they sell cranberry juice separately... except they don't have any in stock. He ended up making us the original 2 drinks we ordered... at the end of our meal.   At least you tried... and the food tastes great.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they at least tried to make a drink and the manager apologized when he finally arrived at the end of our meal.   Tip to management: if you cant provide cocktails to your guests... then don't hand them a cocktail menu right when they are seated and it would have never been a problem.",

Anyhow this is my favorite Korean bbq I've tried so far. They roll out the short ribs onto the grill and it was the softest short ribs I've ever tasted. It was softer than waygu beef! I'll be back again most definitely.   Server Ming gave amazing service Loved the restaurant industrial rustic theme.",

Located in the Chinatown area of Las Vegas, 8oz Korean Steak House, offers a great variety of meats and other Korean dishes.  With so much competition for Korean BBQ, they differentiate themselves from the others with their quality of beef.  The interior decor is a lot nicer and more modern than most Korean BBQ restaurants and, their service is fantastic.  They have a full bar and offer more than just Korean beer.  I definitely recommend them when your craving Korean BBQ.  Great for groups, parties, or an intimate dining experience.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "New Korean BBQ restaurant located in China Town! Pretty spacious, open floor plan and seating, modern decor and a full bar.  First impression and vibe was good and the staff was friendly.    It was a Sunday afternoon around 1pm when we stopped by and there were a fair amount of people dining but no need to wait for a table, yay!  We ordered our favorite meats plus the staples you have to order along with the meat: steamed egg, soybean paste soup (tastier than it sounds) and we also received Korean tacos and kimchi pancake. The pancake was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. All the side dishes and sauces were flavorful and yummy. The meat was delicious and the egg and soup were very good too!  I love the fact that we have many options for Korean BBQ restaurants to choose from when we are in the mood for it. I grew up in Las Vegas and we used to have to drive to LA for decent K-BBQ. Well not any more!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars was due to the lack of organization among the staff, which i think is just part of the growing pains of opening a new restaurant and it wasn't too bad. I bet in few months it will be running like a smoothed oiled engine!",

    "text": "First time trying this place and I am conflicted. First off, I love the decor and overall look of the place, very modern and looks like a fancy steak house.   No complaints with the quality of the food at all, everything we ordered we really enjoyed. The issue is with the service:  We got there around 7 and they were pretty packed, we were seated immediately and sides were brought out right away. Then we sat there for a long while waiting for the waitress to come to take our orders. She was very friendly but the rest of the service was not the best: -we asked for two glasses with ice which never came -we had to ask for napkins twice -we had to stop a staff and ask for drink re-fills and for more sides, they never came back to re-fill our waters -the guy that cooked our meats was very messy, he dumped the whole plate of garlic steak on the grill then put the pork belly right on top...I did not like the fact that the placed the non-marinated pork belly on the same grill as the garlic steak -they were so busy they just throw the meats on the grill, never told us what we were eating -we ended up grilling our own meat half the time because they rarely came back to check on us -we ordered lobster which never came  It was obvious that they were under-staffed, towards the end of our meal when a few tables have left, they came more often and cooked out meats. I felt that the female staff were great, Bora cleared out dirty plates, asked us if everything was ok, and cooked our meats neatly. Whereas the guys were very unfriendly, we asked for stuff and even though they did give us what we asked for they never reply to let us know that they heard us, they simply walked away which is rude.   I realize that this is in Chinatown and I usually don't expect much service from Chinatown, but the place is nice looking and gives a fancier vibe so I expected more service wise. Also, for the price we paid service should have been better.   I really like the place and the quality of the food, but service really annoyed me. There are cheaper KBBQ places with better service.",

    "text": "The food was good but the service needs to be better  Went there last night with a big party and the service has gone down hill.    First the water jugs was empty and no one came to refill it, considering we had 2 people cooking at our table because we had a big party, its weird that no one notice the water containers was empty.   Second, at one point the heat was up so high on one of our grills that the smoke was going right in to the face of 2 of our friends. This went on for like 5 min before i pulled the ventilator down closer to the food to stop the  the smoke.  So the waiter comes back, sees the the ventilator low and pulls it back up to continue cooking.  So after he pulls it back up the smoke starts going to the faces of my friends again. They were obviously waving their hands in front of their faces to get rid of the smoke. It was pork belly so the smoke was crazy... this goes on for another 5 min before the waiter realized what was going on and turned down the fire.  So after he turned down the fire and the pork belly coarse was done he tossed on the next pork dish.  So after he tossed it on, he never turned the fire back up.  So after 10 min of drinking and chatting with my friends i realize the the pork was not cooking at all and completely raw still.    At this time i had to wave down another waiter to come and turn the fire back up so our food can continue to cook.  After they tuned the fire back up and finished cooking, they never stopped by to check on our waters and basically we had to flag someone down if we wanted anything because no one came and checked on us.   All in all it wasn't a horrible experience, the food was good but the service was just so-so.  I took one star away for the smoke and raw meat on the grill for 10 min fiasco and another star for lack of attention after the meats were cooked.",

    "text": "Yeah!  A Korean BBQ place that handles reservations.  That is great.  And it is NOT AYCE so that is good too.  I think.  My first impression was - clean, cool, roomy, tons of service.  Very nice first impression.  Nice bar and plenty of drink selections.  Menu - while not AYCE, they have all the types of meat you want, and they have some combo style menu selections that you can use.  I don't really care if the place is AYCE or not, I am going to order what I enjoy and I am not gonna over order because it is free.    The Combos - The combo at first to me was just a bit confusing.  They have A,B,C or D at varying prices, and A/B is for four people, C/D is for two.  A good selection of the best meats.  They also have the Beef or Port Combo, small or large. All are priced and all are reasonable.  Food - The quality was fantastic. Very good.  The large white beer was satisfying.  We had plenty to eat for the four of us.    With the combo, you could add some things, so we added the Egg Stew and the Tofu soup..  Very good.  The place is not overly busy on a Friday night, our waiter did disappear and leave us as he had another job, so we had to finally ask for a new waiter. That was a bit odd and the fact that no one really took care of us after.  But when he was there, our waiter was great, cooked up things nicely and spread it around and got us organized.  I will be back.",

I am a music lover as well, and the music was upbeat and modern. I can tell that the owner really takes this business seriously and he wanted to create the best atmosphere possible.   P.S. Every time I go to KBBQ, my hair and clothes smell like meat/smoke, and that really bothers me; however, when I go to 8oz, my clothes and hair never smell afterwards. I know that many people wouldn't find this that important, but it actually matters to me.  I think they have a great ventilation system that won't leave you smelling like BBQ for the rest of the day!

It's not all you can eat but the amount of food they give you is perfect. We got the 1C combo which included beef brisket, rib finger pork belly and grilled pork bulgogi. You get two different salads, and we loved them so much we asked for more. You also get a choice of soup, we got the tofu, a egg stew, cheese fondu and kimchi pancake. I never had cheese fondu with my veggies at a KBBQ before, but HOT DAMN it was good. We loved all the sides, everything tasted well prepared. Most of the meats come from Nebraska, you can really taste the quality. Our server was Geri and he was awesome! They cook for you so you can enjoy your company. They have Wagyu A5 so I will be going back for that!  #shutthefrontdoor it was soooo good!",

I do a ton of math) and you factor in what you're getting. It's worth the small premium.   So what are you getting? Higher quality meat! Not even just a small jump in quality either! They even have a high grade Wagyu if that tells you something (not included in the combos). My party got the Beef Combo L, Pork Combo L, and Wagyu add-on. Every cut they brought us had immense flavor and just the right amount of marinade. The wait staff were all very attentive and courteous. The gentlemen cooking our meat was very knowledgeable and would recommend the best cook and tips on how to enjoy the meat, example for some of the non marinated, he recommended a hint of salt, etc.   In closing... every time I visit Las Vegas, I'm going to make an effort to try and come here! My parents even approved and they're usually the type that's critical of every Korean restaurant they go to.",

Prices were more steep than the other kbbq places but worth it if you prefer quality over quantity. The best part of it all is that they cook for you so you know everything is cooked right! They had a nice spread of side dishes. Will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Vegas. The place gets really busy so worth calling to try to make a reservation for a large group!",

    "text": "This is probably one of my favorite late night Korean BBQ spots in town. They do not have AYCE. Everything is in a combo set or ala carte. We normally get the small beef combo or set D since I don't eat a lot of pork. Our favorite is the Galbi and the seasoned boneless short rib. I love that it comes with a stick of veggies (onion, mushroom, bell pepper) and melted cheese. If you don't eat red meat, the shrimp and scallop here are amazing. They squeeze lemon juice over it while it's cooking. It's very juicy and flavorful. I love that the server helps you cut and cook everything. They also have this shaved ice thing for dessert. The chocolate one is our favorite. It's very light and fluffy and not too sweet.  The service here is great. We've probably been here more than 10 times and it's always been consistent. One time my boyfriends credit card was accidentally charged twice and when he called the owner got back to him right away and voided the charge and offered him a discount on his next visit to the restaurant. Another time, the waitress spilled soup all over the table and some of it got on my purse. Luckily it was a clear soup, but they gave me a complimentary dessert martini to make up for it. I don't really drink but it was a nice gesture. This is a great place for larger groups as well. The way the tables are set up you can have 8-10 people and not have the group broken up.",

It's hard for us to break away from our few favorite KBBQ joints here in town, but we had a larger party and I wanted to spend my Friday night eating delicious food, not waiting for a table. Fortunately, 8oz takes reservations.   We opted for Combo B, which gives you a nice balance of beef and pork. The beef belly was a great quality and was really flavorful. The galbi was juicy and the pork bulgogi had some nice heat behind it. The pork jowl was my favorite and will definitely order it again next time.   The banchan was well balanced, and the only clear standout was the kimchijeon. The gyeran jjim (egg stew) was underwhelming, but the doenjang jiggae was delicious.   If you are looking for traditional Korean BBQ, in a more upscale environment, check it out.",

This is a great quality Korean bbq restaurant located off strip and I would definitely visit again. We ordered a la carte.  There are 2 primary things I will judge a Korean BBQ restaurants on. Meat quality and quality of the sides aka banchan and a lite third is the quality of the other dishes.  1. Meat quality was great here. They serve premium cuts of meat such as Wagyu.  2. Sides were great. Not only do they have a selection of Kim Chi, various pickles as well as an assortment of fried side dishes and other dishes (my fav is the potato and the raddish pickles).  The service here was also fantastic. We had a large group of 24 and they were super attentive. Often at times when we dine in large groups, service can drop a little but not the case here. It was also great to hear from great reviews from our Uber drive about this place on the way there (so it was definitely favored by locals!) We will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Best high quality Korean bbq spot! Not an AYCE place, but they serve Premium prime cuts of meat, have friendly and helpful service, and a pretty beautiful array of meat selection and \"appetizer\" dishes.  *BACKSTORY: We came to splurge for my BF's belated birthday dinner. He's always wanted to try Wagyu and this place serves a huge cut of Kobe beef at market price!*  Anyways, Made reservations for 6pm and moved back the time to 6:30 with no hassle! (Be very careful with time! Although this was not the reason for us being late, this restaurant is located in a complex with very limited parking!) Upon entering, the beautiful 8 ounce sign and a nice lady welcomed us at the front and led us to our table which was already set with the side dishes and water! (the inside is much larger than expected, too!)   What we ordered: Kobe beef at market price(which on that day was $180), blueberry soju($12) and set D for two people($63) . (We honestly ordered too much for 2 people and ended up taking most of the last two dishes home). This also comes with two different Salads to share and Because of our order, it also came with the steamed egg and a side of soup. (We ordered the spicy tofu, which was DELICIOUS with the added seafood...mussels, clams, etc.)   THE KOBE BEEF IS AMAZING. Well honestly ALL the meat is amazing-very well seasoned and tender...And what's wonderful is that all the meat is brought one by one and cooked by the servers so there's no mess ups! (Lord knows how worried I was leading up to cooking the wagyu!) Nor ally, you're in charge of cooking the meat on your own, but this was a nice surprise seeing them be so attentive and making sure the meat we had was grilled and served properly. The attention to detail when cooking the meat was great (one of our two servers prepped the grill with swirling rosemary and then gently placed the meat on the grill, followed by rosemary again. She asked us exactly how we wanted it-medium rare, then cooked it, cut it, and plated it in front of us-all whole keeping a friendly conversation and telling us more about the restaurant and cuts of meat that are served. I appreciate that!) Afterwards came the veggies from the Kobe beef, and set D! (By this time we're getting pretty full, but because it's not AYCE, you can take the grilled meat home).   This place really does pay attention to detail with the numerous amounts of side dishes that accompany your meal, to the quality meats, and elevated service! It is definitely $$$ and something I wouldn't do too often, but the Set D on it's own as well as the different dishes could have me coming back even when I'm not feeling super fancy.   Thank you to Vicky and Howon for your service and making my boyfriend's belated birthday dinner go so smoothly!",

It wasn't busy so we were able to grab a table pretty easily.  We ended up going with the large Beef combo and a separate order of soy garlic chicken (hubby got a lot of crap from our Korean friends for ordering that lol. He deserved it).  I have to say...the meat was great, every single cut. I would have preferred all non-marinated items but, alas, that is not how the menu works. That being said, the marinated stuff wasn't overly sweet like many other places.  Service was also pretty good.  We didn't have to lift a finger.  They did all the grilling, cutting, some serving.  They also have different grills for different cuts so we just left it to the servers to do their thing.  I'm pretty picky about KBBQ's due to the high quality I know is out there. Fortunately 8oz met all my expectations both in the meat and service area. Definitely will be on repeat for us whenever we're in Vegas!",

This place is actually pretty big, we were given the private area where they had sliding doors. Vents could have worked better, but we were not smoked like I was at 888 Korean BBQ. Im not quite sure what we ate since it was more like a pre fixed type dinner. Definitely had quality meat in our bellies and you must get their margarita, sadly I wasn't able to finish it. They have about 3 flavors and you have an option to get it with or without a beer/cider. The servers cook on the table side for you, so that you can have an enjoyable dinner without needing to pick a team leader to cook  no burning or overcooking any meat either. Just sit back, enjoy your drinks, company and good food!   Their dessert menu was lacking a bit, wasn't really into 'shaved ice'. Most likely would go elsewhere for dessert next time. I think the waitress told me the chocolate was the best tasting out of all their flavors.   This plaza is very crowded on Friday nights and the rest of the weekend, definitely not enough parking. I had to park on the street and others I know had to park either behind the building or at the furniture store. Carpool if you can!",

So we called they had a table open we left one place to come here.  I will say in my experience, even when the meat is good some times the sides are lacking. I thought the sides here were very delicious indeed. I am sadend to say as much as I wanted to try the kimchi stew it had pork in it, which I do not eat unfortunately. I do understand that is the traditional way to make the stew so no hard feelings.   At the end of the meal, our server went on .. a break or lunch?? and no one came to finish up the rest of our table we sat for 25 minutes or so after we finished before I used my phone light to flag someone down for the bill, besides that little flaw no complaints from me",

    "text": "Update#2 - Back in town a year later and it is just as good as it was the first two times we had it. This is at the top of our list for places to eat when in Vegas.   Update#1 - Came back for the second night in a row because we were craving the short rib. Service was superb again with a different server. Had the spicy tofu stew and wow, big winner, you should pick this! This will be a must stop the next time I am in Vegas. Come get some great food!  Out here for work and happened across this outstanding Korean BBQ restaurant. First, super attentive and gracious service. David is an awesome server and really treated us well, ask for him when you go. The brisket, marinated short rib, outside skirt and pork belly is what we had and they were all fantastic with the marinated short rib as the clear winner. The accompanying side dishes were also super good with standouts in the cold kimchi soup, egg stew (like a souffle), and steamed buns. All in all we were very pleased and will definitely be back!",

Soup was amazing as well, only complaint was that the beef bulbogi was weirdly minced, still great flavor though. We only tried the all beef combo but it was amazing. Good comparison to Hobak, only difference is that I think hobak uses marinade and 8unce doesn't. At least it seems like it. Again, would highly recommend this place",

They do cook the meats for you which was a nice addition that some kbbq don't offer.   The interior is modern and nice for a Korean bbq .   We ordered one of the combo sets and were kind of disappointed . Our servers seemed like they were new or in training . They forgot our stew side and we had ordered cold spicy noodle and it  didn't come until we asked them . We also didn't get our steamed egg . The manager took the spicy noodle off the bill for the inconvenience and we didn't ask for that . Also he gave us a free dessert which was a shaved ice with chocolate dust .   The sides kept coming after we would eat them. They have cold soup (radish water ) which we love love love . There version is a little sweet which is ok . We got 2 different salad options as sides as well . They don't have cheesy corn but do have a cheesy fondue which works great with the beef almost like a Philly cheesesteak when dipped into the cheese .   The meats were good but nothing to write home about . We had the scallops and lobster as well which were cooked in a butter bomb .   There are positives . The ambience is nice . The service was attentive even if disjointed . They have all the alcohols that one would want ... wine / Korean beers and a wide selection of other beers . The price point and value are pretty good . It is very clean inside as well .   I'm not sure if we will be back because there are so many kbbq options in town . Goong on rainbow sets the bar and when we goto any other kbbq that's what we compare to.",

I can tell their meat is very very high quality, fresh, flavorful and tasty. Two thumbs up!!  The restaurant was full and we had to wait about 15 min to be seated. Interior is super clean and very modern. Their entire staffs were very attentive and treated us very well. Our server Howon cooked all our meats to perfect and it was getting better and better after every meats. We really enjoyed. Their banchan, meat quality, everything was better then any other Korean BBQ places in Vegas. I am super happy to find this restaurant.  We ordered four desserts and I can't describe.. omg, it is soooooo good. Never had this before. it was well worth it. Definitely coming back!",

Meats are downgraded from a year ago and side dishes are \"extra\" charge and tried to charge me for small cup of cheese for my son. I spend $$$$ lots with my customers and now I won't be entertaining here anymore. Not worth the $ especially their terrible server.   Instead go to Hobok bbq - so much better quality and service.",

We were seated immediately at two tables for 4 each, which allowed our server to grill our Kalbi, Pulkogi, Brisket and RibEye steaks.  We ordered the large combo for 4 for each table and there was plenty to eat, great sides, especially the kimchi and assorted piclled condiments. Two of us had the Kloud korean beer and we topped off our meal with a bottle of Soju...We were given the Soju cups and the pretty bottle the soju came in as keepsakes.  Even thought this restaurant had just newly opened, we decided to try it based on the 11 previous reviews which gave them great compliments.....We were not disappointed, and it was delicious and the whole dining experience was great.  Once this gem of a restaurant is discovered, I feel it will becoming a prime go to place for Korean Steak.  We all wish 8Oz Korean Steak House all the thanks and best wishes for their future  success....Will be back....Chosumnida....",

First let me say this place is not what I was expecting! We walked in and were met with a super modern atmosphere. We were immediately greeted. It was a Saturday night and they were slammed so this is big because a lot of places take a while to notice when people walk in. We were seated in about 5 minutes and given time to look at the menu. They have a straight forward menu which is easy to navigate. No frills. We picked combo c because it had the option for lobster which we've never seen at k-BBQ. All of the food was delicious and they had so many sides to go with it. The server was attentive and constantly made sure we had what we needed. What we liked was it seemed that every table or two had their own server who stayed with just them. Our server bounced between us and the table next to us so we didn't have to cook any of it ourselves. She carried on a conversation with us and explained items when we'd ask. The only thing that kind of bummed my husband out was that they never brought out the cheese fondu, kimchee soup or other of those sides but we did receive the salads and dips. Now i say only kind of bummed him out because we didn't even realize until our 3rd meat because we'd received so many other side dishes that we lost track. It definitely was not a deal breaker and we will for sure be going back next time he'll just make sure to get his kimchee soup. Check this place out you will not regret it!!",

We tried it cause it's the newest thing on the block. Come in and got greeted and seated right away. The menu was explain to us on the choices. We could do combos or al la carte. As a couple we chose combo A: small. It came with four types of mouth watering types of cuts from beef and porks( all of which are marinated to godly perfection). Assisting the cuts are 6-8 side dishes that are not included cause it comes FREE. Combo is also assisted with veggie kabob, steamed eggs, cheesy fondue, and your choice of soybean soup or kimchi stew. Oh and kimchi pancake so yum yum. What makes everything special was our caring server. He grilled our meat and know actually when it was done for the fancy,finest flavor. Like our beef brisket which ( don't laughed) tasted like the finest and I mean like if you tasted a $100 burger  but in many thin layers of oh my Jesus. Ryan was very informative about the restaurant and he entertained while cooking for us. We shared laughter and conversate and we learn he is an inspiring film maker. He is making us became a regular I can tell you that.  This place , the people there and the love of god the SHAVED CHEESE CAKE FAVORED ICE WITH FINELY SHAVE COCONUT AND CHOCOLATE will make us come back long time. We love 8oz and it's way of service.",

My favorite was hobak before 8oz came along. It really depends on what you desire for your meal.  If you want pretty good meat then I would tend to lean to hobak. However what I really like about 8ounce was for multiple reasons. 1. It takes reservations  2. It's super clean and modern 3. The staff are way more friendlier 4. Side dishes wise, I like 8oz  We ordered the large combo because we had a party of 4 and it was plenty! One thing though... they do not allow another refill of the egg souffle which happens to be my favorite but o well.   They also have this dessert in a martini for 7$. Totally overpriced but it does taste good. We got both the chocolate and the green tea and it's like the snowflakes shaved ice.",

Rib fingers and kalbi are the bomb, I could eat 12 portions of each. Super great value considering all the food you get and you don't have to cook anything yourself.

We most likely would have not finished it.   Luckily, they offer lunch specials for only $15 each. You pick your choice of meat and a side of soup or noodle of some sort. I picked seasoned boneless ribs and kimchi soup. Everything came out delish. Service was great. Staff were all attentive and friendly.   I want to come back with my hubby and kids, because they, too, love korean bbq. This is one of the top tiered I've tried in the city. We have tons, most are ghetto and low meat quality. Amongst this spot on that top tier of KBBQ are my favorites; Hobak, Magal, and Goong.",

    "text": "By far the best Korean BBQ I've ever been to. It's not a cheap \"All You Can Eat\" place, rather it seems  to be focussed on quality ingredients and outstanding service. This model works well, because even if it seems more expensive at first, you won't leave hungry. Their sides are unlimited and are really good (other than the egg custard dish, that was just weird). They help cook the meat for you as well, and will make sure it's cooked to your desired doneness. The bulgogi beef is incredible, but pricey. What we did is bought a beef combo with an extra bulgogi, and it worked out perfect. If you want Korean BBQ in LV then this is the place to go.",

So sorry to our server because my friends are embarrassing! But he was very tentative and he laughed at my friends bad jokes. Ha!  We went during their soft opening. Their bonchon were really yummy! Their kimchi was probably the best I had in a while and the potato salad was great. My friend kept asking for more.  We got a beef set and a pork set to share between 6 people. We finished all of it and the portion size was good. I had to tap out near the end though. I'd try to come again soon since we came during soft opening. My favorite dish was probably the short ribs. Their meat is comparable to all the al la carte places. However, I feel like I still like Hobak more because of the marination. But their side dishes own Hobak's.   The reason they're called 8oz is because apparently all their meat portions comes in 8 ounces?",

    "text": "8 Ounce Korean Steak House   If you're a fan of Korean BBQ, then you'll be a fan of 8 Ounce.  There is no shortage of KBBQ restaurants in Las Vegas, especially in Chinatown.  The problem with a lot of these KBBQ restaurants in Vegas is the long wait times. I called 8 Ounce on a Saturday night and asked if they take reservations.  They stated that a reservation isn't needed since the wait would be no longer than 15 minutes.  Sweet!  15 minutes in nothing.  We arrived, and it was dead.  We didn't even wait 5 minutes to be seated.  Like the rest of the KBBQ restaurants out here, banchan is included with the meal.  But for me, it's all about the meat.  Meals come in 8 Ounce Combos, Beef or Pork Combos, and Chicken & Fish.  3 of us shared the Small Beef Combo for $59 and added the Soy Garlic Chicken for $22.  The small beef combo came with brisket, marinated short-rib, and seasoned boneless short-ribs.  Our server was also our cook.  He explained that each meat serving was 8 ounces and the chicken was around 12 ounces.  Either I was starving or the we really didn't get 36 ounces of food.  We shared the food evenly and I was still hungry.  All meats were prepared the way each of us requested.  As for quality and taste, the marinated short-rib was my favorite.  Overall, 8 Ounce Korean Steak House is a great addition to Chinatown.  I'm a fan of 8 Ounce Korean Steak House, especially since there is no wait.",

Our server, named Bo, I believe, was impeccable. Above and beyond for service for us that day! We were very happy with him.  As soon as I looked at the menu, it reminded me of Hobak. I don't usually have non-AYCE KBBQ anyway, so Hobak is one of the few that I have been to. There was actually a lot of food for us. It may be because it was the first meal of the day for me, but I think I was pretty much there after the first food item, out of 4. I texted a friend to come by and help us finish, lol.  We got the A set. Small is 4oz and large is 8oz. It comes with 4 items: beef brisket, outside skirt, grilled marinated pork bulbogi, and premium pork belly. There are 4 pork belly items you can choose from, by the way. We got the regular premium. It comes with your choice of soup, steamed egg, and lots of side dishes. The 2 buns were also really good. Yum.  I liked the brisket, was disappointed with the pork belly, but the others were pretty good. My favorite part was the dessert!!! I NEED THAT, by itself, in large quantities. So good.  I think I would want to come back to try out their lunch menu, maybe one day!",

I'm not a fan of cold soups but the one we started off with I'd happily order again. The meats tasted pretty good, some better than others.   Even though the food was pretty good, thats about all it had going for it. Pretty sure the vents weren't working as the smoked just by passed it and filled the room. Only one of our three tables had a friendly server. She was engaging the table, restocking and clearing quickly, and was the only server who even offered rice. The other two tables never said a word, left the table cluttered with empty bowls, and forgot a few things including the soup we ordered. What was even worse was half way through eating, a cricket landed smack dab in the middle of the table. The waiter was flipping the meat as everyone reacted. The waiter froze and only waved for help after everyone failed to get it clear of the table. It finally landed in food and the help grabbed the plate with the cricket and walked away with it only to step on it right next to our table. As our table continued to react in shock, the waiter said and did nothing about it the entire night, as though it never happened. Finally we were given free shaved ice, but considering all our tables had it and we've had this service at kbbqs before, who knows if it was about the cricket or the fact our meal was very expensive, they never said.   With so many amazing Kbbqs in the area, you'd be better off skipping this place.",

    "text": "So nice, I had to go back twice (in one week). Fellow yelper Rica M.'s birthday celebration was pushed out, but I had been salivating over photos of this place for the whole week already. My husband and I decided to eat here anyway. Ryan was our server and he was engaging, informative, and cooked our meat perfectly! I know some reviews mention some difficulty with the quantity of food, but we really found the meal set we got for two people was more than filling and we had enough left over to go. The banchan here is slightly upgraded from the ACYE joints and they give you a soup option as well - we went with the tofu soup. The only  thing I would point out is that the tofu soup did have shellfish and seafood, which neither the menu or the servers pointed out, so those with allergies or aversions to shellfish/seafood beware. The dessert at the end of the meal was a cheesecake shaved snow cream with chocolate, which allows you to end your meal on something not so heavy. I'm not a huge meat eater, but I did like the quality of the meats we ordered and the service/cooking of these meats better than what I've had at Hobak. I also like the restaurant area and ambiance of this place a bit better, and for now, wait times are very reasonable to non-existent.   We ended up going back with a party of 8 a week later to celebrate Rica's birthday (see Regina I.'s detailed review!). We were split into two tables of 4, which was fine. We found the larger family meal big enough for the 4 of us at our table and didn't find the need to order more meats. I was hoping Ryan could be our server again, but we ended up with someone else who was a bit busier and not as attentive (they also had to juggle our two tables and all the other parties they had though). The Korean food scene (non-ACYE) is steadily improving and getting more competitive in Las Vegas and 8oz is definitely a contender for #1.",

It was truly a 5 star experience for my clients who have experienced Korean BBQ in other cities famous for KBBQ.  We had 6 meats (4 beef, 2 pork) and each was fantastic, fresh and you can really tell that they use prime meat as they state. While the brisket was a top contender for me, the outside skirt steak was by far the most favorite of the table (we ordered a second serving).  Overall the food was fantastic, and I hope that they will add brown rice to their menu. The server (Bora) made the experience even better, as I have heard from friends that the service can be hit or miss.   The atmosphere seemed to be very friendly and welcoming, Bora even took photos of our group for us. I understand that KBBQ is cooking at the table, but I wonder if there could be any improvement to the ventilation or filters to prevent a large amount of that smell transferring to your clothes?  I can imagine that the parking situation could be difficult during busy times.  The bathroom was very clean, and I like that the wash station is outside of the bathrooms so that you do not have to wait for an empty bathroom to wash up.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this location!",

So I called to make a reservation so I could see how this kbbq place compares to the others around town.   When we walked in I liked how it wasn't so stuffy and you didn't hear loud sounds from fans like other kbbq places. Several people asked how we heard about this restaurant so we told them from a friend and also from yelp.  From the moment we sat down we received excellent service. The owner and chef even came out a few times to say hello and check how we were enjoying our meal.  We ordered a combo A and also added kalbi afterwards. Everything was delicious and it was a surprise that our server cooked for us the whole time. I enjoyed that when we asked which sides were good she explained which sides were best with the meats. Also, we did ask for refills on many sides and they were more than happy to grab them for us no questions asked.   Overall, I enjoyed dining here and will be back in the future with family and other friends. I would like to try their lunch since the owner stated that they have different side dishes for lunch.",

Efficient friendly staff and great tasting food.  We arrived a were seated very quickly.  Drink orders taken, two South Korean beers, a Hite and a Kloud, Both tasted like a Corona to me.  We opted for the dinner menu instead of lunch and homed in on the pork combo for two.  Marinated pork collar, pork bulogi, spicy pork belly.  Combo also came with corn cheese, chilled soup, tofu soup, steamed egg, two salads, one regular lettuce and other was noodle and slivered green onion.  We also were loaded up with all the normal sides you expect at Korean restaurants.  We were served daikon slices with beet broth, potato salad, fried tofu, kimchi pancake, kimchi, tempura zucchini, radish in sauce with jalapeno.  All we could both say was wow, yum, good, great delicious.  Everything was great.  We also ordered a side of Japchae and it was fantastic.  This is definitely a place to return to occasionally.",

You can order a la cart but the combinations are so much mo re affordable it gives you no reason to act towards the a la cart menu whatsoever...

    "text": "Sorry Hobak, but in my eyes 8oz has proven to be worthy of being ranked #1 in Vegas for Korean BBQ.  The quality of the meat here actually blew me away, and the same top quality is obviously evident in the banchan, service, and ambiance as well.    The brisket is a common measuring stick between KBBQ restaurants, and the version here at 8oz is the best, not just here in Vegas, but I think in the whole southwest US, including Los Angeles - it has the right amount of fat, tenderness, and flavor that sets apart the truly great chadolbaegi from other great chadol.    Even better than the brisket, incredibly, was the 8oz marinated galbi, which has to be one of the most tender and perfectly seasoned meats ever served in a Korean restaurant.  The galbi was not overly sweet (which is a common problem in other Korean BBQ joints), and it honestly didn't need any other accompaniments or seasoning.  I'm not too sure if I would choose a legit steakhouse USDA prime ribeye over this.    They cook all of the meat dishes here for you and will ask how you want your meat to be cooked.  The server at our table basically lived at our grill and it felt like he was part of the dinner group cause he was around so much.  The cheese fondue is kinda cool but it's unnecessary.  The vegetables for grilling are also delicious.  Hosts and servers don't yell out a greeting everytime a patron enters or exits the restaurant (this is a good thing).  The place is clean, modern, and efficient.  Background music was not loud.  Bathrooms are clean, with handwashing sinks located in a communal area.    Again, just to drive the point home - the meat quality has no rival.  You will spend a little more at 8oz, but you will definitely be glad that you did.",

So their were 5 in our party and we decided with the Large and small beef combo 2x brisket, short rib, ribeye, and skirt stk. The lady who served us our food had a name tag that said Trainee, so I was like this isn't going to be good. The Trainee took our order but didn't seem knowledgeable. She took our drink orders and we also ordered 5 Rice's for us and also 2 steamed egg 2 Tofu Bean soup. So they started bringing us our side dishes which looked promising. We began eating our side dishes and became thirsty. They didn't bring us any water and had to ask for water and she forgot that we ordered soda along with the water. Then we had to ask her for our rice that we ordered coz we were eating our sides without any rice. Then our faces were a mess because we didn't have any napkins and had to ask for napkins as well. So things are becoming a little irritating by now because we had to ask for all utensils and water, and our side dishes.   So Trainee started cooking our food, again we ran out of our sides and had to ask for more. Trainee never said a word to us as she was cooking and she didn't properly divide the meats to our party. She cut the meats by half and their were 5 of us so the 3 of us got less meat and we had to ask her to split it up evenly. As she was cooking the smoke was getting in our faces because she didn't bring the vent down and I couldn't breathe which was unpleasant. As we were eating our brisket we asked for our 2nd steamed egg and bean soup and she said that it was coming out. I didn't understand why they just didn't bring all 4 of the soups out because the 5 of us had to try and split the two of the soups and it was just a hassle. My wife and I had to wait for the second set of soups before I could try it.   When it was time for our ribeye another cook came. I guess a more experienced cook. I noticed that none of their employees had name tags. So our new cook is a slender buff Asian dude. This dude never introduced himself and just began cooking our food. He was a bit better than Trainee, he seemed like he knew what he was doing and at least he utilized the air vent.   When we ate our meats and we all agreed that it didn't have as much flavor as we are accustom too. We heard that 8ounce meats were top notch but we felt that Hobak was much better than this place. 8ounce was super expensive for the type of service and quality of sides and meats we received. Their desserts are separate which was disappointing because their are other places that offer complementary desserts. Best thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's beautiful, clean and it's very modern but it will take more than looks to bring me back. We will NOT be coming back to this place nor recommend it to our friends. We get better service and better quality meats elsewhere!",

I've had Korean BBQ one time and it was horrible. That was about 5 years ago. Never tried another place after that. Tonight was absolutely a surprise. We visited this restaurant as a recommendation of a friend. Who's one of the best chefs I know. Everyone must try this restaurant. Food was absolutely excellent and a huge surprise. Our server and grill master was Bora. A True asset to this business! When you come ask for her tables. Employees make or break any business. Repeat customers from this day forward.",

But in any case, I'm glad they didn't because if not, I wouldn't have found this gem.   Called up 8oz to make a reservation and we were all set.     We rolled up and I got to say, this place was top notch all the way.   The service was on point the entire night.   Our server explained the menu and how everything worked and we were off.   The food came quickly and everything looked great.   It was also pretty cool that the server cooked all the food for you, so all you have to do is kick back and enjoy.   They even take the time to trim off any pieces of meat that get slightly burnt.....how's that for 5 star service?!?!?!  Everything we had that night was great, but a few stand outs were the boneless short rib.......OMG, probably the best that I've ever had.   Super juicy with amazing beefy flavor.   The Jap Che was also the best I've had.    The noodles weren't over cooked (like most places) and were perfectly chewy and the sauce was infused into every single bite.   Even the premium pork belly dipped into the cheese fondue was winnahs!  All in all, it was a great evening in a beautifully designed, chic new restaurant, with amazing food and good friends.    Thanks 8oz for ending our Vegas trip on such high note.   I'll be back in Vegas in 2 weeks for a convention and will be taking some friends and associates here for sure.",

Went in expecting the half off everything after 10pm on Thursday's-Sunday's but \"they got rid of it\", the next dinner happy hour changed to half off specialty drinks, then it turned into a happy hour combo and some alcoholic Korean beverage only. None the less, that doesn't take away from all the things this place does right.",

When we got there, the guys seating us didn't have any above average service. I did like that they set up all the sides before we sat down. Some of our sides were so spicy we couldn't eat them. The servers cook everything for you, which I guess is one of the reasons they call themselves better than other Korean BBQ places, but when I told our server that the meat was ready she took so long to cut and serve it that it was practically well done pieces of meat. We ordered the grilled bulgogi and my friend said it tasted like ash, she couldn't even finish it. Came here for happy hour thinking we'd get a great meal, and after $40 we left hungry. Never got my water refilled until the end and the servers wear t-shirts, yet they still rave about the restaurant. Glad I got to try it, but even with happy hour I won't be back.",

The servers are all really nice, and they cook the food for you! I love this because I hate being on cooking duty when eating kbbq and I feel like a lot of times I overcook it. The combo has 3 8oz orders of meat along with veggie skewer, Korean pancake, steamed egg and a stew, which we chose the spicy tofu stew. They had a great selection of side dishes that were all refillable. Their grill hood is so cool, it has an adjustable height so it catches all the smoke. For the grill they grease it with butter whichever I've never seen any other place do, so the meat never got stuck to the grill. When it came to the short rib they changed the top of the grill to a more open style so you get more of the flavor of the lava rocks. Everything was so delicious. Very with it, and lots of yummy leftovers to take home.",

This place is the best food find I have found in Vegas to date. The service was fantastic and the ambiance so modern and clean. Great supporting cast for the main star - the food was so pure, rich and outstanding! The steamed eggs were like clouds of smooth flavor, the cuts of meat were insanely high quality and the presentation was crisp. Such a great food experience!",

    "text": "I tried this place with my boyfriend since we were in town for our birthday weekend and we love Korean BBQ from where we live so we decided to try it out. They are open till 2am. for all those night owls they cook the food for you and it's to your liking. You get soooo many sides and choices. Employees were great and super friendly and very attentive of us and our needs. They went over the menu for us and recommended some good things. The only thing is it's not an all you can eat place. It's all ala carte but it comes in combos and it's plenty of food. I just wish they would give a steamed egg for each person not just one but $5 for an extra and I was willing to pay because it was all delicious!!!! They also provided a complimentary dessert which was vanilla shaved ice with cocoa and chocolate syrup. It was delicious. We will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Magal Bbq was closed at 11pm, so me and my boyfriend came here to try it out. We don't like AYCE bbq since the quality of the steak sucks. They don't offer AYCE, which is good for us. Tried the ribeye steak. Server overcooked it. Wanted it medium rare but cooked it medium to medium well... so the ribeye sucked...my boyfriend wanted to try the prime short rib since we like high quality steak. The steak was presented nicely. The cooking part no... the steak was good quality.  I wish they train the staff how to cook the steak. Oh well.. The interior was nice.  The side dishes had no flavor and they don't give you alot. The kimchee was old.  If we are paying over $100 for 2 person, I would expect more. If the owner is reading this, please get your side dishes checked out for crying out loud. Such a shame to put out crap side dishes at this kind of restaurant.  I don't want to drag it on like this, but we also work in the food industry. So sad to see a business starting out like this.. check out magal bbq or hobak bbq. Way better for the money in my opinion.",

My husband and his military buddies wanted an authentic experience to remember their time in Korea 50 years ago.    We had loads of excellent quality food that they prepared at the table.  Would definitely go back on our next visit to Vegas.",
