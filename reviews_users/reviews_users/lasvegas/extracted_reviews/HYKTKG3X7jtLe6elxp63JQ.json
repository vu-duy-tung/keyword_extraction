    "text": "This place is located in a strip mall just walking distance from where I live. It joins a couple other highly rated Yelp restaurants in this same strip mall, KoMex and Baby Stacks. Talk about an all-star location! I went on in on a Friday evening during the dinner rush. The place is small but packed that evening. The restaurant itself is nothing memorable but it's simple and clean. There was only one person doing both the serving and as cashier (she did do a good job holding everything together; excellent customer service too). The only other person was the cook/chef. I went on a Friday because I heard they only serve clam chowder that day and I had heard good stuff about it. I was not disappointed in the chowder. Great flavor and consistency. It was served along with bread, toasted on one side, and seasoned. It paired nicely with the chowder. I ordered one of the smaller servings of fish and chips. The fish portions were pretty decent. Thick cod in golden brown batter that wasn't too greasy. The fries were okay and the tartar sauce served its purpose adding a little bit of flavor to the very mildly flavored cod and batter. I'm definitely coming back. Especially because they are so close. I'll be honest, I have not tried any other fish and chips locations here yet to really compare to. I may update this review at a later time.",

    "text": "First time at Off The Hook Fish & Chips, ate with my mother just coming out of work. It's this cute little place that my mom found on buffalo and flamingo not too far from where we work. When you first time check in you can get one free fish stick so we used that and my mom had a groupon 2 for $30 dinner. We ordered mozzarella sticks, a medium (2 fish sticks) & large(3 fish sticks) fish & chips both had the chips and coleslaw. Mozzarella sticks were great, no marinara sauce though but they still tasted great with the ranch that was given with it. Definitely satisfied my craving for melted cheese in stick form ^_^ When the fish & chips came presentation looked awesome, good sizes for the fish. I had high hopes for these fishys because my fish & chips experience in Las Vegas were thick breading, sogginess and fish falling out of the breading plus saltiness. But Off The Hook Fish & Chips was the best I've tasted in Las Vegas. Their breading is light, crunchy and I didn't have any whole pieces of fish sliding out of my breading while eating it. I was very impressed with the fish probably the only place I'll go to for Fish & Chips now cause they actually do fish& chips the right and tasteful way. Thank you Off The Hook for restoring my faith in fish & chips :))",

That is until last night.........My grandson was celebrating his 16th birthday and the only thing he wanted for his birthday dinner was fish and chips.  I did some research and saw that Off the Hook had some great ratings........So, we made the jaunt, about 20 minutes from Henderson and we were more than amazed at the quality, the quantity, the temperature of the fish and fries, the wonderful creamy coleslaw and the deep fried oreos were over the top.  My grandson ordered the Cod Father which was an ENORMOUS amount of fish, fries and coleslaw and as a growing boy teen he finished almost all of it.  I would recommend this place to anyone that loves fresh, flaky authentic fish and hot fries without the least bit of tasting greasy.  We'll be back.......Very soon...",

Now the hush puppies weren't my favorite and the sauce I believe it comes with was just okay. BUT the fish and fries was so so so so good! The fish was fried to perfection while still being moist on the inside and the fries were cooked perfectly. Lastly let me just say I HATE coleslaw and normally I would ask for no coleslaw because I don't like being wasteful. But I decided to give it a try and let's just say I couldn't put my fork or the cup it comes in down. That coleslaw was divine and so refreshing. This will definitely be a restaurant I come to when I don't feel like having my meal prep for the day.",

    "text": "So I was very excited to come here as this place has 4.5 Stars. I thought it would be great fish and chips that I would crave every time I came back to Vegas but Sorry Off the Hook, it's just not 4.5 Stars.  The place was clean and the service was great and very friendly, that deserves 5 stars but the fish was just not good. I should have read more reviews. Like Diana H said the fish was bland and in my case it was under cooked. I asked to have it made well done and they gracefully brought me a new platter but in my opinion it still was not well cooked. I couldn't eat it. I spent $25 on a meal I did not enjoy. They were large pieces, which is good but maybe the pieces need to be smaller before they are fried but what do I know. The coleslaw was ok but could have been better too, too much mayo. I also tried the zucchini, it was soggy. Maybe I've just had great fish in other locations and it did not compare but this is just my opinion. Feel free to come try for yourself.",

We decided to hang up and call again. Next five minutes the line was busy, no big deal. We finally get a hold of someone again and tell them we will be there at a specific time. They tell us they only have enough batter for one order of dessert. Another thing that would not be a big deal if everything else had gone right. We arrive and have to wait another 15 minutes for our food. Once we got home we found out we weren't given any sauce at all for our vegan fish and chips. It is such a shame that such amazing food is paired with such poor customer service.",

The cups were dirty that we were drinking from. Asked for lemons he brings 3 out on a napkin. We ordered fish and chips and the Mahi tacos. My daughters tarter sauce had something brown at the bottom of it. My tortillas were cold and not warmed up. Go to use the ketchup with my fries and the ketchup bottle not full and nothing but  watery liquid came out. The tapatio sauces were not the usual bright red it was dark and more brownish. Where I was sitting I could see in the back the cook was not wearing gloves no hair net either. I guess I should've been happy a baseball  cap was on instead. Soda machines out of order they had other liquids in pitchers sitting on the counter. The back of the kitchen dirty and unorganized. Asked for ranch theres 3 of us he brings out 1. Got the fried oreos and it tasted like the grease from the fish. At Smith's theres a coupon that has a buy 1 get 1 meal and 50% off the desserts and it's not being honored any more. There is no Grade from health department posted anywhere on what this restaurant is supposed to be. Daughter used restroom and no paper towels. So needless to say never coming back here. I wasted my time and $35 for nothing.",

Everything that came with our lunch were pretty good, needed a little bit more seasoning but maybe not everyone likes their food with more salt n pepper like I do. It's a small restaurant and when we were there it wasn't that busy. The guy was by himself I think but he was very nice and efficient. The batter on the fish and seafood was nice and crunchy, the French fries were good. Would definitely go back when we want fish and chips again.

Only thing I didn't love was the sauce, which was a sweet Asian inspired situation. But it was light on the sauce w more on the side so I just got many sides of tartar and put it on everything.   The real call will be on the lobster roll- will update when I get around to trying one of those.",

Well I probably should have kept reading. I'll start with the good...The shrimp were great...crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Scallops were the same. Things went all the way wrong with the fish....This was really bad and I think it's fighting back as I type this review! The pieces were huge, golden brown, cooked nicely on the outside. The first piece was thinner, so I ate it. Had a little bit of a strange taste, but it's fish. The second piece,  I should have thrown into the trash! It was super thick and not well cooked, pink and kind of cold. I decided to microwave it because I was not about to drive all the way back over there! My lunch break was over. For the price the meal should have been better. Stop selling fish that's on its way to expired, seriously! I thought of being courteous and calling them, but they weren't courteous enough to sell me fresh fish so too bad for them. I won't go back!",

Both were excellent.  But the \"FISH AND CHIPS\"!!! were definitely \"Off the Hoooook\"!!!  The cod was as fresh as can be...nicely filleted (by Dan himself) not too thick...not to thin and cooked perfectly (not greasy) with a light, crisp and tasty batter.  It comes with tartar sauce but for me the flavor and seasoning was enough without it.  Dan please accept my personal thanks for opening this restaurant.

The tartar sauce wasn't the best, but I douse my fish in vinegar, so I didn't miss it too much. Service was good. Fried Oreos were decadent! It's not a bad location, but we were solicited twice for handouts, so make sure you're careful!",

It felt like I was crunching on bird food while all the little pieces got stuck to my teeth. And the catfish portion was very thin. Nothing special about the fries, they were like regular diner fries. The sauces weren't all that great, only 1 tasted homemade/ mixed a bunch of sauces together. Almost tasted like a low quality first street brand. The place is Decorated cute not the neatest job but they tried. The tables also felt a little sticky. I don't know if the lady who served us was the owner, she seemed to have a lot on her hands. There was trash on the table next to us the entire time we were there. Running a restaurant takes a lot, therefor maybe hire help. From the cleanliness to the quality of food. I wish I would've liked it.",

This seems to be the only real fish and chip place in the valley (besides the super expensive options on the strip) so we thought we'd give it a try, seeing as it had great reviews.   Just goes to show the Yelp rating isn't always as it seems. This place is a solid 1 star, maybe 1 and a half. As friendly and helpful as the lady was at the front, the food was terrible. The batter on the fish was hard and uneven, and seems as though they haven't changed the fryer oil in a very long time. Fish was over cooked because of this and was tough. Jumbo fried shrimp were tiny and again over cooked and my girlfriend didn't have much to say about the fried oysters (which is always a bad thing).   Overall there's no reason to go back here or recommend it. The only saving grace was that we went to Handel's Ice Cream afterwards which is a short drive away, to make our trip to the west side of the valley even a tiny bit of a success.",

    "text": "**THIS REVIEW IS FOR PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP - THEY HAVE CHANGED OWNERS SINCE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN BACK FOR A SUBSEQUENT VISIT**I recently went to a fish n chips place in Half Moon Bay (review on it's way!) and now I think I'm on a fish n chips binge. I previously tried Lazy Joe's in LV, but was a bit let down by the experience that I had just written fish n chips off in Vegas. I had remembered Off the Hook (great name, btw) was in the same plaza as some of my favorite places (Komex, Chef Zen) so I decided to pop in here for dinner with my husband.   The food here is solid. I enjoyed the flavors in my Fish Wrap, which had cod, avocado, cabbage, Thai sauce and fresh pico in a tomato-basil wrap. This will be something I'd order again and again. Their cole slaw was crunchy and refreshing and the fries were hot and crispy. My husband enjoyed the fish in his fish n chips and the cod used was very 'meaty'. He'd like to try the cajun seasoning next time for added flavor in the batter. Tartar sauce was perfectly tangy and the owner read our minds and replenished our supply when needed.   What I'm actually most impressed by is the amazing customer service from the owner. He was doing everything on his own - explaining the menu, taking orders, checking in on tables, refilling drinks, cooking, etc. At one point, there were 6 parties in the restaurant and he took care of everyone so seamlessly. It was way better service than I've gotten at a sit-down restaurant with more staff available. He never made anyone feel rushed or neglected, and he showed a lot of compassion to an elderly woman that was eating by herself and wanted to chat. It was the kind of genuine service that really leaves a positive impression on you and this is a business I'm rooting for.",

They said it would be about 45 minutes but man was the service fast. Not only that but they included all the extras... forks, napkins, limes, ketchup , tarter sauce, etc.  We got two orders of the fish and chips and it did not disappoint. At first we had been debating if 2 would be enough but they are huge pieces. And so filling. The fish was nice and crispy and brown in the outside, and pure white and soft on the inside. It couldn't have tasted any better.  We got an order of the Mahi Mahi Tacos to share. My husband loves these. The Mahi Mahi was delicious, it broke apart so easily. But I don't care for their sauce. It's a kind of spicy weird sauce . I don't think it taste good so unfortunately unless they change it I'll have to pass on the tacos in the future.  Super excited we found this place and can't wait to order from here again!!",

I traveled through New Zealand last summer and I've been to the United Kingdom and I can honestly say without a doubt that Off The Hook's fish and chips were among the best I've ever had!    I grew up hating fish because I thought it tasted as bad as it smelled, and then a friend of mine told me that fresh fish doesn't have that fishy smell.  He also told me you can taste it.  That fishy smell and taste?  You won't find it here.    My partner and I ordered a basket of the Regular Fish & Chips (Whitefish) as well as the Premium Fish & Chips (Cod).  The breading is great and was perfectly fried both times that I've been here.  The regular Whitefish pieces are actually a little bigger than the Premium Cod so you do get more bang for your buck there.  The tartar sauce is fantastic and I loved it so much I needed one side per piece of fish.  My partner and I both ordered two pieces each and we were full.  The chips (fries) were also delicious.  Off The Hook is very affordable and I am now a regular.  Try it, you'll be glad you did!",

The coleslaw, the fries, the beer battered onion rings and the Fish, all fresh and sooo delish!! It's now on our restaurant rotation list and go-to spot for fish & chips!    Fresh food, clean kitchen and environment, friendly staff.. Highly recommended!!",

They gave me a single tiny ketchup packet and RANCH DRESSING NOT TARTAR SAUCE (see pictures). I wouldn't expect this kind of service and quality from jack in the box. DO NOT GO HERE  EDIT: went here again on a groupon deal... Food was good and prepared as requested... I am bumping my review up to 3 stars...",

    "text": "Hubs & I went to \"Off the Hook\" tonight for dinner. Out of full disclosure, I'll admit, I am NOT a fan of the fish. My Husband however is British, born & bred so, I've got to indulge his native cravings every once in awhile. We've tried every fish-n-chip and British establishment in Vegas. Really, our quest is solely for fish-n-chips. I was excited to find such a highly rated NEW fish-n-chip joint in my neighborhood. Tonight felt like the night so, off we went...   Location/Ambiance; The restaurant is ingeniously tucked into a shopping mall that includes two HIGHLY rated Yelp restaurants; Baby Stacks & KoMex. The outdoor sign is temporary as, this is a new restaurant starting up. The inside is very clean, chairs & tables new & comfortable. Bathroom was spotless.   Service; The owner was the guy-next-door kinda fella. Just a really nice, friendly sorta guy.   Food; Both Hubs & I got the fish-n-chips- to go. OH.MY.GOSH. This is GOOO-oood! I got a (homemade) tangy tarter sauce that was sooo flavorful & amazing! The cod tasted fresh & had a firm flaky texture. The breading was light & crispy. My Brit Husband, whom has lived in Vegas over 21 years said; \"Best Fish-n-chips I've ever had in Vegas\". That's saying a lot. The chips were crisp & tasty. The coleslaw.... Ehhhh. It's was ok. We read through the menu planning our next trip. He's got fish sandwiches AND Deep fried desserts of all kinds; Oreo's, Twinkies, candy bars, cheesecake. I've never tried, but always wondered. Maybe some day when I'm weak.     :-)",

He  appears to have little respect for American health standards. The place has taken on a dirty tint from lack of cleaning. I visited several weeks ago, saw some issues that did not comply with county and state health regulations.  I reasoned that this would work itself out. A board has now been placed to block the view of the kitchen. Good solution? On my most resent visit I noticed that there is no CCHD inspection certificate posted as to A, B, C,  rate by the inspector.  I made an inquiry as to why, the owner came out of kitchen and stated that he is still waiting for a certificate and said the inspector was there and removed the A certificate of the previous owner.  I had my two piece wild caught cod in my had before my questions.  This was 13.99.  Fine no problem. This was the most dry fish ever and the fries were soggy, the very small cup of coleslaw was warm and all was tossed out .  There is something fishy going on there and its not the smell of old fish. Will not ever be back.",

There were 4 tables marked \"reserved\", and I asked the restaurant associate if we could sit at one of those tables. He stated they saved those tables for larger parties.  We were given the option to sit at one of the 2 top tables.  Feeling restricted and limited to a table choice with only 2 tables in there at that time, I was about to leave but decided to give it a shot.  During the visit only one of those \"reserved\" tables was utilized.  My guest and I did order the lobster roll.  I was surprised to see on one menu it just advertised lobster roll (found on the web), also indicated on their special board it showed \"Lobster Roll\" and the menu in the restaurant indicated it was lobster AND crab. However it was probably 80% crab and 20% lobster.   I would like to state, the sandwich WAS flavorful, the fries were hot and crisp, the coleslaw was good and, the food came out in a timely fashion.  I would just probably advertise \"Seafood Roll\"..",

Since I moved to Vegas I have not found a place with good fish and chips, they cheap out on the fish they use or the batter does not have many spices in it so they taste bland. Not this place, you have the option of the el chepo fish or the premium which is cod. Spend the extra money and go for the Cod. The batter has the right amount of spices. My wife and I split an order of 4 pieces which was just enough for both of us, she also ordered the key lime pie for desert. We took that home- the pie was just average-skip it.  I did enjoy my lunch here, the only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant itself, its great for fast lunch but I wouldn't take out of town guests here for say dinner, they need to try and upgrade that a bit. Also the strip mall its in doesn't feel all that safe-OK during the day but I think nighttime would have a totally different feel.",

The fried scallops are Truely a rare treat this far north and west. OK it's all the best of the best.  The restaurant is small(ish) but it's clean, well lit and cozy comfortable. Even the potty wasn't the scary trip we encounter so often.  I found this lovely spot on Groupon but didn't buy a coupon and didn't need one. The price is reasonable and the volume of food is well above the average.  I have to say a word about Dan, he has absolutely gotta be the nicest person I have ever met (really) and and he adds to this delightful dining experience like no one I can remember.  If you're over that way for any reason, hungry or not, this is a treat that you should not pass on. We fish lovers plan to reture real soon.",

I'm sure there was a little but if lobster claws in there but the flavor was drowned out by the imitation crab.  Had they used all lobster meat the roll would've tasted amazing.  The fried shrimp was very good and was a good size for the price. Everyone's review for the Coleslaw was spot on       Glad we had a coupon.",

When I went to open my dinner of a mahi-mahi  sandwich with fries , cole slaw, and an order of hush puppies to my surprise I had none of that in my bag!! I was given somebody else order which I didn't want or eat! After trying to reach the delivery driver or yelp for resolution with no luck I called off the hook only to be told they know about the mixup but they close soon and will not be able to make it right. So basically what I got was what I got!! Thanks Yelp and off the hook! Well as of the time I posted this my account has not been credited back my purchase. Thank you for the gesture but to come on here and say I got way more food than I paid  for and then blame it on yelps driver to make it look like I'm wrong somehow when a simple apology would have made me a content customer.",

Over the years I've been dissatisfied with almost every battered fish I've tried. This tasted just like hers. Served hot and crispy, it was fantastic. Fish pieces are a good size, coke slaw was good, fries nothing out of ordinary, but still good. Atmosphere is very casual. I will return for sure.",

The price is not low by any means, but the quality here is the highest I have had in fish & chips, and to me it's more than worth it. Not to mention the friendly service, Dan is the best!",

While I sat there with time to be a little bit irritated, I also noticed that I was overcharged about $4 for my meal. When I was going to mention something about it, they came out and gave me a card worth $14 for my next visit. I decided not to bring it up.  A few weeks later, I decided to use my card. I ordered the same skipper combination plate with a fried zucchini appetizer. The guy inadvertantly (I hope, one doesn't want to think it could be intentional) tried to give me the wrong change (would have shorted me about $1). I pointed it out and moved on... Well my food came up and I took it and went home to eat. After I got into my combination plate, it didn't have the oysters or the jumbo shrimp, only fish and fries.  This place appears to be run in a complete incompetent manner.  I won't be back for their decent, but not great food.",

    "text": "I'm a long time lurker of yelp.  I've used it 100s of times when traveling to find top restaurants in unfamiliar cities.  I have never left a review before.  Usually the good places have plenty of reviews so adding one more doesn't seem necessary.   Off the Hook was so good that it got me out of my normal lethargy.  I'm a self proclaimed  fish n chip expert.  I've tried it in countless restaurants throughout the US, through Asia, Europe, (Brits are everywhere!), and around 20 renowned places throughout the United Kingdom.  Off the Hook is one of the top 5 Fish and Chips places I've ever been to.  It's truly excellent.  I can't believe that such a great place is hidden away in the desert.    The fish is excellent quality cod and has a good flake to it.  The breading is close to perfect.  It's light but has the perfect crunch without being greasy.  The chips are more American style than English, so a visiting Belt might quibble with this aspect.  To an American though these fries will be much more pleasing.  They're close but not quite as good as 5 guys fries, for the east coasters reading this, which to me are the pinnacle of American fries.  I can't recommend this place enough. My first thought was that a bit pricey but I quickly discarded thought after my first bite.  Its worth every penny.  If this guy was on the Strip he could be charging double and it would be considered one of the  great Strip food deals.  To top it off, the owner/cook was a super nice guy.   If you're a local and don't go here regularly, for shame!  Visitors find a way to go if you're a fish and chips fan.  It's worth the effort.",

Let's face it... we all need some golden brown fried deliciousness in our life from time to time.  If you're going to do something fried, you've got to do it right.  The good will deliver you to the promised land, the bad is.. well bad.  Off the Hook really knows what they're doing with their fish and chips.  The batter on the fish is perfect, and not soggy or wet.  The batter sticks to the fish, and doesn't fall apart.  The fish is light, flaky, and very clean; no fishy taste whatsoever.  I've only ordered the premium fish which does cost a few bucks more, but it's amazing so I see no reason to change it.    The chips are crispy and soft, and not under salted.  Both house made tartar sauce and malt vinegar are available.  I'm not big into tartar typically, but theirs is fresh and better than most I've had.  I'd also recommend picking up the hush puppies, they're to die for.",

It came with 2 shrimp, 3 pcs of the cod+ 1 smaller pc for yelp check-in, 2 scallopp pcs, all over a bed of fries.   The star was definitely the large pieces of white cod meat covered in a thin layer of crispy batter.  The food came out fresh and fast, and I was really impressed with the thin layer of batter.    The dipping sauces like tartar, cocktail sauce for the shrimp along with vinegar and ketchup for the fries were all delicious.  If I had to complain, I like my fries a little more well done to get that crisp. Either way, we devoured that dish and it was perfect for sharing.    Overall, fresh seafood makes excellent fried food.  The beautiful white meat from the cod is super tender and easily worth the $18 price tag.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Off the Hook for some time now seeing how this was the \"spot\" in Las Vegas.  I attempted to stop by for lunch with my mom, who is a huge fish & chips lover, but it was closed on a weekday. Their hours of operation have seemed to change since then because they are now only closed on Sundays.  My boyfriend & I came in for lunch & I walked in surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant.  This is a minuscule detail that only I would get excited about, but they have bendy straws! Why can't all restaurants have bendy straws? That excitement was short-lived, however, because I spotted \"gunk\" in my boyfriend's water. I don't have a word for it because I'm not sure what it was, but we informed our waiter immediately. Apparently, there was an issue with the machine & my water had to be taken away as well even though I already had a sip because I was so excited to use my bendy straw. Yikes. We were given a cup with ice & a water bottle.  We got a glance at the menu already on Yelp, but it seemed to be updated & prices were lower than we saw previously.  I ordered their daily special, which on a Monday, is a lobster & crab roll served with fries & cole slaw. My boyfriend ordered scallops & the \"Sailor,\" which included 2 fish & chips, also used the Yelp check-in offer to have 1 additional fish & chip, 3 jumbo shrimps, fries, cole slaw & he upgraded it to cod fish.  I enjoyed my lobster & crab roll & although it wasn't as big as I thought, I got full from it. For it to include fries & cole slaw, $9.99 isn't a bad price at all.  My boyfriend enjoyed the jumbo shrimp. He could have lived without ordering the scallops & surprisingly, he didn't care for the fish & chips. I did try it & it's not the best I ever had, but it's probably going to be the best in Las Vegas that I've tried so far.  It wasn't the greatest first-time experience, but I would give this place another chance & bring my mom again to be a judge!",

My gf and I got the Premium Atlantic Cod Fish platter with Cajun fries and hushpuppies. The fish was perfectly cooked, not oily at all and the perfect amount of outer crispness. The fish inside is perfectly cooked and juicy and together with their tartar sauce and some malt vinegar, it's a match made in heaven. They definitely aren't skimpy at all with their portions, and the quality matches it.  Kudos to this place! You guys definitely know how to cook fried fish right.",

    "text": "So I gotta confess that I am a pretty healthy eater, so on my cheat day I am looking for something that really satisfies. The curb appeal at Off the Hook was not great, but I shrug it off as many places with good food lack that. The place was not crowded but there were alot of take out orders. The staff was friendly and service was fast. The cod was definitely the star of the show! A little more breading than I would like but still crispy and the fish was nice and firm. My kid ordered the regular white fish. It was much more flaky but he enjoyed it. Now things go south a bit. The coleslaw was too creamy for my palate and lacked the crispness that I enjoy.  The fries were descent but not fresh and a bit under seasoned. We also had a few chicken strips but would not recommend them (its a fish place anyway!) The portions were generous so unless your really hungry, stick with the 2 piece meal. Overall, I would give them 3.5 stars. If you are just serving fish and chips you need to elevate your game and I don't feel they did. Off the Hook is just a bit off the mark. I feel if they made a few changes it could be a \"go to\" place but right now I will settle for a few good pieces of cod now and then sans the chips and slaw.",

So I go to the restaurant and find out that the fine print on the Groupon says I can't get any of the shrimp or scallops.  So I ended up getting like 3 pounds of cod, which was fine, but most of which got discarded.  Waste of money - if you're going to restrict menu options, it shouldn't be buried in the fine print so that you end up with angry customers when they show up.  I've never encountered a Groupon where specific menu items weren't included, and I can't begin to figure out why they would do it.  The whole point of a Groupon is to bring in new customers and convince them to come back and become a regular customer - why in the world would you not let the customer order what they want?    Bottom line - I felt deceived, and I will not be returning.",

We repeated couple of times our order then the server said she got it.

After we got our food, the waitress came with someone's else's order and then realized it was for the table next to us. I ordered Coke but they gave me Diet.

The fries weren't anything special, but the Cole-slaw was pretty amazing. I think it's the pepper in the sauce?? The house-made tartar sauce was pretty freaking unbelievable also. I may have started dipping my fries in it when the fish was gone... and then started looking around for more food to dip in it. No shame! I want to try the fish tacos next time. Can't wait!",

So I called them and explained, the person that answered thought it was a single item order and reviewed my order and said it was his mistake. He gave me two options and I went with having the rest of my order delivered to me. I had payed in cash so I did not want to bother with being credited.

Angelo was holding down the fort on a busy Saturday afternoon and frequently checked on our table to make sure we were good. We started with the Cape Shark tenders appetizer and it was perfectly cooked! Also ordered the Sailor platter and upgraded to Cod which is very well worth it. You will definitely leave with a full stomach and leftovers! Overall, loved how the breading was light and crispy and the quality of the fish. Great pricing for the plates that they serve. Easily the best fish and chips I've had in Las Vegas! Gotta give this place a try!",

I ordered fish and fries, grilled mahi-mahi tacos and lobster roll for takeout. I'll probably stick with fish; it was crunchy outside and moist inside. The coleslaw is fresh.  They have mostly fried stuff so I'm glad they have something  grilled like the  mahi-mahi tacos which are pretty good and well seasoned. I also ordered the lobster roll which I had to throw away, as it had a funky formalin smell like those artificial crabs. I would have been more than willing to pay for more if they serve the real thing. I wish I've known about this before I ordered.   I also found out they have daily specials which are pretty good deals.   Overall, service is good, convenient location. Fish and chips are good. I'll stay away from lobster and crab rolls, unless you're okay with artificial stuff.",

We have tried a couple of the others on the list and they had good fish & chips but so far these are the best!  We got a four piece of the Alaskan Cod to share. Nice large pieces of flaky fish with just the right amount of batter. We also ordered the hush puppies. I'm not a big hush puppy fan but my girlfriend from Tennessee is. We both thought they were the best we've had. Along with the fish, the fries and coleslaw are also very good. One thing I wish they had was some clam chowder.

Don't get me wrong.  I like tarragon.  I just don't think it belongs on a lobster roll and if you decide to use it you need to know it's a powerful herb.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  Also I want to point out that this was not crab.  It was imitation crab and if you're going to serve it you should not be calling it crab on the menu.  I may be wrong, but the lobster seemed more like langoustines than real lobster.   Still the bun was spot on.  It was grilled perfectly on both sides and was shaped like a real New England hot dog bun.  It had just the right mix of mayo for the meat.  The fish n chips were OK.  I didn't really like the batter.  For one thing they were somewhat overcooked.  The fries were fresh and well made.  The portion size was good.  The pieces of fish were quite large.  I was really close giving 3 stars, but I went for four because I like seafood and the service was good.  Any time a seafood place appears that's better than average I want to give it a try.  I'll try this place again for something different.",

I've seen reviews stating the fish batter was bland; I beg to differ!  It was just enough to compliment the fish and allows you to get a delicious crunchy bite. The chips were cooked perfectly. The coleslaw was yummy, my only suggestion would be some celery seed to add the additional kick of flavor.  You can taste the passion that comes from the kitchen.   The woman behind the counter was very kind. The positive attitude from those working gives yet another reason to come out and support them.    I will be back!!",

I was here awhile ago  I left a review.. my last review I had put about the tartar sauce being very mayonnaisey..no flavor..and still is the same..the owner replied back and was going to check on it... I feel with such a good quality of cod..which was great ..u should make sure u have a equally good paired tartar sauce.. especially with the prices..which i dont mind paying if everything is equally made to perfection..tartar sauce should have lots of lemon juice..sweet pickle relish..very finely grated onion and fresh dill..cole slaw has no flavor but mayonaise ..and to the owner or whoever the chef is I read some reviews..about ur tartar sauce..u said u guys make it in house..I think I would just say u buy it like that..if ur a True chef u wouldn't serve such crappie sauce..u really should use my recipe in this review.. guess people dont know good slaw either..if guess u guys are big on mayonaise overload. .also this time ordered the jumbo shrimp..it's actually jumbo batter..the shrimp was tiny..it's was all batter..u couldn't even taste the shrimp..its like at long John silvers where everything is made with the same batter..and everything taste the same..and other thing if dining in..when u move ur chair at anytime it's so loud and annoying..easy fix..go to home Depot put those little tabs on bottom of legs of chairs..there's so much competition with places to eat in vegas..these are little fixes that make a huge difference..then ur place would be a gem and worth ur prices...",

The gentleman behind the register was super friendly, maybe he's the owner, I'm not sure.  Anyways, the food was absolutely awful.  I ordered the cod fish & chips and cajun fried shrimp.  Note, this is called \"Premium\" fish & chips on the menu, as the standard \"Fish & Chips\" is a cheap whitefish that is hard to spell let alone pronounce.  This I found strange as cod is cheap to begin with and is the standard for fish and chips.  A premium fish for fish & chips would be something like halibut, but definitely not cod.  The shrimp at first tasted quite good but after the first shrimp, I noticed it was mainly batter and it was super salty.  Next was the fish, it was terrible.  It was nothing but grease.  The fish was too tuff and chewy to even eat.  The french fries were cheap typical bar fries which were soggy and greasy, and the coleslaw I had to spit out because it tasted like I put a spoon full of mayonnaise in my mouth. Bottom line, I threw $20 in the garbage and there is no way with this quality of food that these 5-star reviews are real.",

Just places with people who love what they do and they do it well.  This place is the truth!!! It's a hole on the wall restaurant.  Everything is fresh and everyone inside is friendly.  They even let us stay an extra 32 minutes.  I was with family and they just was nice about it even though they were tired.  One of the dudes look like Action Bronson and he was mad chill.  After we left the place we chilled outside in the parking lot chatting just like in NYC.  The food didn't make us feel sleepy or oily.  Vegas folks are just down to earth.  The food was RIDICULOUS! It's most fried foods (So effin what?!) It's vegan friendly! it's just made from love and you can tell.  We ordered the lobster roll (good).  Catfish (yum) Calamari (needs to be fried longer but GOOOOOODD!) The clam chowdahhh (Drool!) The fries (fresh).  Seriously all great things and all good stuff.  I want to go back and take a bath with their other delicious food and spices.  Oh speaking of spices order the cauliflower (HOLY BANANAS that ish was OFF-THE-HOOK!)  Just a quick tip, when you come in if you don't have YELP! download it and \"CHECK IN\" and you can get a 15% discount on your total.   Food is BOMB Hostess/servers are SUPER FRIENDLY Restrooms are CLEAN Tables CLEAN Table wait time QUICK Take out wait time is QUICK Customer service is GREAT Ambiance was like a Sponge Bob Squarepants museum Kitchen SUPER CLEAN Overall experience OFF THE HOOK!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

    "text": "Off the Hook just added a whole vegan menu to there list of delicious eats! Of course, I had to check it out.   Walking into the shop reminded me much of a little British fish and chips shop, and they had everything you'd expect, except the mushy peas. It's very cosy inside and it filled up with people quite quickly.   There was so many options on the vegan menu, pizzas, burgers (with good FYH cheese) and more! But, it just happened to be friendly, which meant $9.99 AYCE vegan fish and chips was on the menu. Who could pass up on that. My table of three all opted in for this experience.   I never was a coleslaw fan, but let me tell you, this coleslaw was really good. The fries were perfectly thick and warm, and the vegan fish was really tasty. To top it all off the tartar sauce was everything I could've dreamed of.   Needless to say, we all left the place with our pants unbuttoned and our wallets felt unaffected. If you have $10 on a Friday, there's no better place to go. I can't wait to try all of the other items on their vegan menu!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try an exclusive fish & chips place in Vegas for quite sometime & I'm glad I finally did. This place is located a bit west from the strip but if you're in for a fishy time, the drive is worth it.   During our visit, we ordered a couple items, including:  1. Hush Puppies * 6 little puppies that are exquisitely delicious...I can't even describe how well the flavors were blended, and the fact that they were NOT rock hard is the reason this may someday be the sole reason I drive halfway through Vegas*  2. Lobster Roll *disclaimer*  We should have read the menu a bit more carefully because unfortunately we missed the word COLD in the description for this bad boy. I love my seafood, but I think this one was a little less lobster & a little more other seafood for me. The first bite was excellent, and then the second bite...I was ready to get my fish & chips back.  3. SAILOR combination plate  * 2 piece fish & chips w| 3 jumbo shrimp.*  Now THIS is definitely one of the finest fish & chips in Vegas. I'm content we chose this platter rather than just fish & chips or shrimp...cause we got the best of both worlds. The fish was thoroughly fried; the batter wasn't overbearing -- and that's how fried fish should be...more fish, less batter!   The proportions of ALL dishes were more than enough for our party of 2. We actually ended up getting a to go box because we couldn't finish.   The customer service was on point, friendly and attentive. Just a little more attentiveness from us on that lobster roll would have made this a perfect date.",

If this restau is in a better area, offer beers/alcohol and has some more tv, they will have more customers.  PS: the staff is very courteous and friendly.",

I tested the the fish and the condiments with my NIMA (gluten sensor) and found gluten in everything.

We had two of the medium orders of the cod (2 pieces each but they threw in an extra half piece with each order) with fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw is fantastic and so are the fries; they're super crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. The cod was especially good! They're huge pieces of fish and really meaty. And I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce but it was tangy and delicious. We also ordered a grilled cheese for the kiddo and it was huge! For dessert we ordered the fried cheesecake with blackberry and strawberry sauce and it was awesome! The vanilla ice cream rounded it out perfectly. They also had Coke AND Pepsi products so everyone wins!  The service was fantastic as well. We were informed that they've just changed ownership and may be opening on Sunday and/or Monday to bring in more customers... I hope they do! The owner was incredibly friendly and helpful. He also gave us a card and told us we could call in our order the next time if needed. I'm hoping this restaurant gets some recognition and stays in business because it's a new family favorite!",

I'm not sure if they were short on staff, but it seemed everyone was and had been waiting for their orders.   One table was so upset because my friend and I received our order before them (they were there before us) they left without paying after they ate.   The food was mediocre at best... Everything was too greasy and lacked flavor. For something that took so long to get, it just wasn't worth the wait.   I can't say that I'll be back again. Super disappointing.",

    "text": "We ate here a few days ago. There were 4 of us.  Our first impression was that it didn't smell like fried food and/or fishy.   5 stars for that, because we didn't leave smelling like that either.  When we started to order, I suggested the server might want to write it down.  No, he would be ok.  Well, he wasn't ok.  We ordered 2 catfish bites appetizers, got one order and reminded him of the other.  But they were catfish strips and we were charged for catfish filet meals (we didn't get fries with these).  The food was good, but it all came out one or two items at a time.   2 orders oysters.  Got one.  Then the other later.  2 orders catfish bites. Got one.  Had to ask for the second order.   1 order hush puppies.  First thing to come out.  1 lobster roll 1 small coleslaw 1 four piece fish and chips 1 order calamari, which was the worst thing we ordered.   About 7 trips for all of this.  And there was only one other table of 2 that already had their food when we got there.    Will we return?   Maybe.  But I'll write the order down for the guy.   And they've discontinued the scallops, which was the main item I wanted.",

There was a guy cooking in the back, he was the only employee but greater me right away. There was 1 customer before me. After a few minutes he gave the customer before me his to go order and then took my order. I saw on the yelp pics how large the fish was so I only ordered a 2 piece fish and chips. Again, this only took a short amount of time and were sent on our way. He put air holes in the Togo bags to release the steam. By the time I got home, my food was still hot and the fries and fish were still crispy. I like the cole slaw, it tastes fresh with a slight sweet tang, very good. The fries were awesome, cooked perfectly. And the fish? Pretty awesome too. It was actually seasoned better than any other fried cod I had before. The gentleman also told me the fish were smaller that usual that morning, so he actually gave me 4 pieces instead of 2! Great customer service! When I saw the pieces, they were a little smaller that compared to pics, but I would have been happy with 1 additional piece to ale up for size. Any fish and chip cravings in the future will be appeased by going here again. Great place!",

We had never heard of this place before Groupon, so that was what brought us in, and I'm glad we went.  The portion sizes were good, and they even brought me an extra piece because he said my pieces were a little small, but the two piece was perfect for me already.  I definitely appreciated the extra service.  It was a little slow when we went in around 2:00 on a Saturday, so the gentlemen who took our order ended up chatting with us some when he wasn't serving the few other customers.  Malt vinegar on every table - LOVE that I didn't have to ask for it.  The place isn't on our side of town, but we will definitely be back.",

My husband, being originally from New England, and knowing what good fish and chips should taste like, said this is some of the best fish he's had since moving out to the west coast.  Our group also tried the fried oreos and fried cheesecake and enjoyed them as well.

The fact that it is close enough to our house to walk over is another big plus. The fish is GREAT - light crispy breading and white, clean YUMMY fish - none of the dark, off putting spots inside. I prefer skinny crispy fries but this place has me sold on their larger delicious fries. We got the 2-piece fish and chip dinner the 1st time and were taken back by the price ($13 each) but it was too much food. We now order the 1-piece ($8) and it fills us up. One suggestion for improvement - add a quality clam chowder to the menu for the perfect Fish & Chips experience. Really hoping this place makes it because it is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood.",

    "text": "What a revelation this place is!!!!! I was searching for the best fish and chips place in Las Vegas online, and after reading several reviews, I took a transplanted New Englander here today -- and they absolutely loved it, as did I! The food was amazing!!!!!!! We ordered the 2 pieces of fish and chips (we actually ordered it with half fries and half onion rings) that came with the most delicious clearly homemade cole slaw (I got an extra side order) and equally tasty tartar sauce, that had just the right amount of subtle flavor. The fish was fried to perfection -- each piece was SO flaky and tender inside, and the batter (perfect and light!) was nice and crispy outside. The portions were huge, and we were both impressed that the entire restaurant was spotless. Everything was so clean! The owners are a father and son who apparently took over this restaurant recently -- and they couldn't have been nicer. Angelo (the son) greeted and waited on us. He's a genuinely sweet guy -- the entire vibe of the place was SO welcoming! My lunch guest is disabled, and Angelo couldn't have been more loving, patient and accommodating. I saw that they had a Treasure Chest on the counter with little toys and treats for kids -- and I thought that this place would be perfect for bringing children to. While we didn't have dessert, next time I'd love to try a fried Oreo cookie... My guest and I were really blown away by how delicious everything was, and by the friendly, loving atmosphere that was made that way by the wonderful owners who also work there (there was also a very lovely waitress who we also liked a lot). This place, this food, and these people at OFF THE HOOK are the REAL DEAL!!!!!!! If you're looking for a no-frills restaurant with GREAT fish and chips (they had some fish tacos and a fish wrap on the menu that sounded delicious that I'd love to try next time!), large portions, and the nicest people around... you'll love it here. I sure did.",

I was full half way through my combo so maybe I should get less food next time, but even though I was full I still kept eating cause everything (Fries, shrimp, cod, scallops and coleslaw) was tasty AF.   The coleslaw was tangy and had a little kick from the black pepper. The fries were good, I used a little malt vinegar, medium crispy with a moist inside. The shrimp were really big and plump, with a little bounce when you bite into them. The scallops have the same kind of plumpness of the shrimp (little more flaky though) and has an interesting oceany flavor that scallops tend to have. The cod is very tender and flaky, although the biggest impression it left on me was how huge it was. (Also I think I came close to closing time so I got an small bonus piece along with my 2 main ones) The breading for the sea food seemed to be all the same, a light pancake like batter, little sweet and was fried perfectly.  The sauces can make of break the taste of all the awesomeness mentioned above, and I got two kinds, the red cocktail like sauce and a white tartar sauce. The red sauce was really good with a little tang and was not too salty with fruity notes. The tartar sauce is decent but i would like it to be a little thicker as it doesn't stick on to the batter that well.  I will definitely be coming here again and would like to try the desserts next time.",

NONE of the food is fresh, EVERYTHING is frozen. The grease was old so the fish and appetizers were very dark. The dining space is very small. From what I saw there is no serving staff. - the cooks seem operate both front and back of the house. - that being said, they weren't very personalable and acted as we inconvenienced them by asking for things such as extra napkins or a different drink because there was a BUG in my cup! I have zero tolerance for poor customer service, you 100% picked the position you're in. This is one place I'll never return and advise anyone looking for a good fish and chip spot to keep searching!",

    "text": "Got here last Thursday with my girlfriend, because we saw great review about this place. Inside of this place, there were plenty of customers that are already inside of the restaurant. I have ordered Fish & Chips + Chicken fingers combo, instead of fries, I asked for onion rings for extra $2 charge. My girlfriend ordered Fish & Chips + Shrimp combo with onion rings instead of fries also.  To start off, fish was melting in my mouth, so tender, crispy outside, which was what I have expected to have. It was great size also, So I really thought that the price was reasonable. Onion ring was a bit burnt, and salty in my opinion. But you know what? They insisted to comp my onion rings because there were a bit of delay, so which was good. I really liked my chicken fingers, but I believed that the size was a bit smaller than what I have expected, and it actually was salty too. My girlfriend loved the fish too no fishy smell, tender and crispy outside, but she actually was not big fan of the shrimp and onion rings with the same reason that I had, salty. She said she had some strong fishy smell into shrimp.  Overall, I really liked this place, great main food, which is fish. I might be asking them if I can make that as a salty free, because I really eat things plain. I will for sure come back if I am craving for the fish & chips.",

I have to assume that either all these 5 star ratings stemmed from having a different chef or they really enjoyed the customer service. Which, by the way, was pretty good. I don't remember the counter girls name, but she was sweet. Anyway we came for fish and chips and left hungry and bummed. The fish was greasy, more breading than fish, and the worst part was it was not seasoned. I am sad to say, I am still on the search for the best fish and chips in Vegas.",

Large pieces of fish. Fish is fresh and flaky, not just a bunch of batter and thin fish. Batter is thin and super crispy. Best fish and chips in town by far.  You are going to pay for it though. Seems a bit high in price, my guess is to support slow business and expensive fish. If you mention Yelp they give you an extra price of fish if you order 3 pieces or more. Definitely large enough to split if you get 3 pieces and 1 free.  Will go back, hope they stay busy enough to survive...",

Their tables are a bit sticky, and the workers are here and there, but overall was a good experience. I believe there were only 2 workers, it seems like they had to serve and cook. So that's a lot to do.   But their fish n chips were delightful. The fish flakes and crunches the right way. It wasn't over battered and They weren't oily. Their tartar sauce was very delicious, it tasted homemade. They also had vegan ranch and tartar sauce that was VERY GOOD. My friends had vegan fish and chips, and I had tried some, and they were crunchy and delicious ! We also had a side of fried cauliflower. It had a kick to it, and it was fried correctly, in my opinion, it made it very tasteful, my daughter ate it not even knowing it was a vegetable !   This is so close to my home, I don't know why it took me so long to check the joint out. I'm glad I did. You got a new customer !   Also ! They have happy hour. one fish w small fries, slaw and tartar sauce for 3$ m-f from2-5pm !!!! So if you'd just like to get a taste, I'd say go around those times!!",

    "text": "Just as the name says, this place is \"Off the Hook\"! After months of saying we're going to try this restaurant every time we're nearby to raid Pokemon gyms, we finally found the opportunity. Three of us just came from work and were hangry so we started right off the bat with the Family Size order of fish 'n chips and added the spicy cauliflower bites and Cape Shark tenders for good measure.  The tenders and bites came in first with the tenders proving to be irresistibly addicting with its crispy batter and flaky-tender hearty meat complemented by the tartar dip--we'd order more if it weren't for our large order coming in. The cauliflower bites are fantastic spicy bites, it is so crunchy and delicious you'd forget you were eating your veggies!  After almost being full from the apps, the star of the meal came in hot and golden. Our first scorching bite was absolutely delicious! The (huge) fish strips was perfectly cooked: light and crispy outside, tender and flaky inside without being dry or soggy and paired so well with the coleslaw and creamy tartar 'dip' (I mixed mine with Tabasco for some zing!)--definitely one of the best if not the best tasting fish and chips we've ever had, and it's not just the hunger talking. Did I mention the crispy, golden chips aka fries is just as good as the fish they came with?  We'll definitely be back for more as there's a lot of good items on the menu to be explored, not to mention that I can play Pokemon GO and spin the stops while waiting for the food to be served by the awesome folks who work there.",

The mushroom's breading is too thick and should change to a light batter like maybe potato starch? Fries were meh. Fried shrimp and fish were okay. Probably won't be coming back here but people should give this place a try since others seem to like this place a lot according to the reviews.  Ate like 5 pieces of the fried mushrooms and threw out the rest",

Been a while since I was in and this fish was thin with another batter recipe that was flat and looked bla.  Place is now different in a sloppy way and the girl at the front was nice, but clearly not trained.  The other customers were upset with the slow kitchen service and both said first n last time.  Bummer.... This place was really good.",

    "text": "Can't wait to come back and try more stuff! My boyfriend and I were starving so we ordered a family size regular fish and chips to share, our eyes ended up being way bigger than our stomachs, because we only finished just over half, but I'm looking forward to the left overs!  Even the regular fish was really fresh tasting (will probably try the cod next visit), it came out piping hot, and the batter was perfect, super crispy but not too thick or hard. The steak fries (which can be very hit or miss with me) were delicious, fresh and perfectly salted. The hush puppies had a really good flavor, and the cole slaw was just right as well. I can see people who prefer the super sweet cole slaw that a lot of places serve not liking it, but I hate sweet Cole slaw so it was great to me.   I'm not sure if it was the owner who was working the counter or just an employee, but despite the place being packed, and it looked like it was only her and one cook working, she was very sweet and accommodating to everyone, even the two obnoxious ladies who were loudly and rudely complaining about the wait.  My only criticism is that they serve the tartar sauce as packets, serving it in little cups is a lot more convenient in my opinion, though with how busy they seem to be, I can see that being a bit unreasonable.",

    "text": "My first overall impression of this place was that it is just a very tiny hole in the wall kind of place. If you'reDining experiences based on aesthetics then this is not the place forYou. One thing that is deeply disturbing to me is the factThat they have zero ways for you to take your containers of food home meaning they give you the Styrofoam boxes that kill the earth And he gives you tiny bags which one of the Styrofoam boxes will not even fit inside of. He also begins to explain how the plastic bags makes the. Food soggy. So my question is this why are you charging so much for your fish and chips if you cannot accommodate people with the proper carry out items to make sure your clients have an overall good experience.   Your kindness does not make up for the lack of professionalism.   He knew this when I ordered and did not even have the courtesy or thoughtfulness to advise us of such a thing.   So if you order to go and it's for more then 2 being your own bags or a box.   That is a -2 stars for me just for that. I haven't even gotten to taste the food and I have a bad taste in my mouth from the lack of thought.   Buy paper bags for God's sake. How hard is that ? You're charging $13.99 for two pieces of cod a handful of fries and some house made  slaw this is America your meals should also come with hush puppies   I spent $74 and now I'm going to review the food. The premium fish and I got the whiting too.   The whiting is not worth. The premium fish is very nice quality. The batter for the fish however is almost just right. They make it way too hard and crispy. You can bang it on the table.   The coleslaw was not good at all flavorless and bland and seemingly warm   Fries were not in good order either but I did enjoy th flavor of the hush puppies.   Our deep fried Oreos, well out of 8 only 1 Oreo had an Oreo inside. All of the others were fried terribly hard , they were busted open and the batter tasted fishy because they cooked them in the same batter as they do the fish.   The guy was very nice. The quality of the premium fish also very nice. Batter too hard. Not crunchy but hard. Coleslaw not tasty at all. Oreos were fishy batter with chocolate sauce.   I have given 3 stars in lieu of my usual tyrant 1 because I know You can do better.",

    "text": "Vegan options!!!  I had the fish and chips. It was Pretty tasty and a large portion. I got Cajun fries instead of regular. They're slightly spicy not too bad but a delicious flavor. The vegan fish looks like it might be tofu. The breading for the vegan fish is  fried and a good thickness.    I also got vegan tarter sauce and ranch. The tarter was good. The ranch seemed to be missing salt or a little more dill. Vegan coleslaw was okay (I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw).   Overall good experience. Clean atmosphere, nice employees.  I'll probably be back with the hope that they'll find a way to make vegan clam chowder.   I got my food to go and they placed the food in an open basket and put it in a bag. So be careful not to throw it in the car and go. I wasn't aware of this but luckily my food made it safely to my house.   A new male employee was being trained. He was nice! Hope it works out for him!!",

    "text": "Raised Catholic on the Great Lakes it was for Lent every year that Fish-frys overtook Friday night, the local Churches offering up whatever random White Fish they could find after depleting the Walleye, but here 20+ years later it was a billboard about Ash Wednesday that inspired a second visit to Off the Hook for anything but the boring options of childhood.  Originally visited in early 2017 and largely unchanged in the thirteen intervening months, the street sign on Buffalo listed as only Fish N' Chips with nearby KoMex Fusion as well as Babystacks still doing bang-up business despite their mediocrity, it was with an order placed online that Off The Hook was entered at 11:45am with the kitchen running behind by just a few minutes, two lunch specials plus a Side and Dessert tallying just over thirty dollars for enough Food to easily feed three people.  Recently adding some Vegan and Gluten-Free choices to a laminated menu plus daily specials featured on a blackboard it was with Styrofoam clamshells and cardboard boats wrapped in plastic plus paper bags that several pounds were carried upstairs to the office and unpacked, two Hushpuppies that were supposed to be included with the Catfish missing but everything else exactly as described on the menu and nicely presented despite being packed and driven almost fifteen minutes.  Hand-breading and frying a wide variety of items to order, line-caught Cod from the previous visit this time served as smaller nuggets on Tortilla Shells with Spicy Sauce, those looking for a filling Lunch for under $10 would do well to check this out with Regular or Sweet Potato Fries, the former additionally offered in a spicy version alongside the 8oz Catfish Fillet dusted in Cornmeal that comes across with all the expected flavor while remaining light and virtually oilless.  Finding Off The Hook's Coleslaw more enjoyable than most in part due to the thicker cuts of Cabbage and a light sweetness it was likely a result of the lengthy drive and steam inside the bag that Onion Rings were unfortunately found to be flaccid despite fairly good flavor, the $6 price for twelve a bit steep when compared to everything else while the Key Lime Pie once again showed well without adding a bunch of food coloring like so many others, the creamy texture and bright Citrus nicely balanced on the Graham Cracker Crust with just a stripe of Whipped Cream.  ***1/2:  Definitely better for dine-in than take-out, but superior to similar local spots either way, Off The Hook remains a worthwhile stop for those looking for good fried Fish and French Fries while the menu offers enough variety that everyone can probably find something they'll enjoy.",

I visited Off the Hook one Thursday night when I was craving some good fish. I walked in and was greeted by two employees. I was given a menu with all the food listed and decided on ordering the two piece cod with shrimp and fires. I also used my yelp check-in that gives you one item free. I received and extra piece of cod yum! I ordered my food to go and it was made to order. It did not take long but it gave me enough time to check out the restaurants decor and cool pictures throughout.  The cod is huge! I can normally eat my cod and shrimp but this time I could only eat one piece of cod and two pieces of shrimp with a little fries. I had plenty to share with my fiance for dinner and he enjoyed it. In the to-go bag it comes with tarter sauce, vinegar, and ketchup. The fish was good and crispy.",

The food tasted like everything was take out of the freezer and placed in hot oil. And that's it. Bags and barrels of frozen fish, French fries, deep fried placed in a paper plate and call it a restaurant. The stuff was nice so I'm giving it a extra star. At least I've been once.

The staff was polite and always checking up on the guests. Chose to dine in to get something off the menu not the all you can eat.  I ordered the Medium Fish & Chips comes with 2 large pieces of Fish (Cod) with French fries & Coleslaw. The fish came out hot & fresh. The fish batter was just right (not over battered). Crispy & tasty. The French fries seasoned well & crunchy.  Chose malt vinegar with my fish which made it taste even better.   Good place for Fish & Chips. Will surely be back to try other items on the menu.",

The mahi fries were really good though that was why I gave 3 stars.. maybe I just went on an off day. Probably won't go back.",

The food took about 12 minutes to come out, and we were happy to see that the owner hooked us with 5 pieces of nice sized cod.  The fishes were juicy, and tartar sauce was on spot. Creamy, tangy, not too rich.  Kudos to my friend for ordering mahi mahi instead of fried cod for diversity. I was surprised at how delicious the mahi mahi tacos were despite being grilled and tasting healthy and refreshing.  The owner asked us if we would like the twinkies to come out after the meal, so that they would be fresh. Good call for that, because the fried desert was a nice way to end our meal.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but for the quality of service and food, it's worth it. I would come again next time i crave some fish and chips.   P.S.- there's a lot of food. I ended up bringing a pice of cod, a coleslaw and some fries home. Second meal is going to taste good.",

Also you can change it up with other options. The sizes of fish were perfect. The texture was light and fluffy. The breading was just right. Not to much or too little. The breading also didn't overpower the fish taste. The coleslaw was the perfect combo of sweet and tart. Not to dry or soupy. The atmosphere was quaint and simply. Nautical decor on the walls and a very cute painting on the front entrance. It's inside like a strip mall so you need to be looking for it. I think these kind of places are the best kept secrets. I bought this deal on a Groupon. I was impressed. If you don't fill up on the FIsh n Chip order some Fried Oreo's...TO DIE FOR! Definitely will be going back to this place.",

I had held off from eating anything and was ready to try some of the items that everyone on Yelp has been raving about.  I checked for a sign giving an explanation.  There was none.  I called to see what was up.  No answer because the phone must only be in the business.  There was not a voice mail option.    I walked to Hikari in the same shopping center and ate a Bento Box.  Not the same food by any means but it was delicious and for sure a healthier lunch.    I don't know why Off The Hook was closed on Monday.  I looked in again at 5:00 when I was finished at Hikari and still not open.  I hope they leave a message on their business line with details of their store hours and shut downs if this is going to happen again.    I would still like to try the food because I've never eaten it before.",

    "text": "I've had this place on my \"to try\" bookmark list for a while.  I decided that today was the day.  I've never had a lobster roll and after reading some of the reviews about this place I was very interested in eating one.  I ordered the Monday lobster roll special, and  catfish strips appetizer.  The man taking the order was very courteous and explained the menu well.  After taking my order I sat down to wait for my order.  The man went to the back.  A few minutes  later a group of four came in and a lady came out from the back room to bring them menus.  After giving them menus, the waitress went into the back kitchen area.  After a couple of minutes the women in the group got up and told the men they wanted to eat somewhere else.  So, the women left pretty quick and one of the men told the waitress they changed their mind.    I kept drinking my beverage and looking around.  I went to go take a picture of the new menu items and noticed the B grade health card.  I wonder if that's why they decided to leave (we will never know for certain).  I had already paid and was waiting for my order so I decided to see it through.  LOL.  The man who took my order came out with a beard guard on so I'm assuming he actually prepared my order as well.  Again, he provided very courteous and attentive service.  All things considered I inspected the food upon arrival, temperatures and taste very carefully.  The lobster roll looked good and the meat was cold.  It tasted okay.  I could definitely taste and see the imitation crab/seafood.  I could see pieces of real crab, but since it was in a mix it was difficult to taste.  I truly tried to find real lobster, but I just couldn't.  As far as taste, again all I can say is... it was okay.  A little too salty for my taste, and the imitation crab/seafood  overwhelmed any real seafood in the mix.  The cole slaw looked really good, was cold, but tasted too tart (too much lemon juice maybe).    The catfish appetizer is described as strips on their menu.  They were pieces.  There is a distinct difference between the two.  Being a self-proclaimed fried catfish connoisseur, I know the difference.  Because of the varying sizes among the pieces, the small pieces were fried too much and rendered inedible.  I was able to eat two maybe three of the larger pieces then threw away the rest.  The fries were hot and wound up being the majority of my meal!  I still consider myself never having tried a lobster roll.  I will hold out for when I can get one made with 100% real lobster.  Overall this was a disappointing experience.  Update:  After reading the hand written explanation about the B health rating (seen in the picture posted), I decided to look it up for myself online at the Southern Nevada Health District.  It was for more than just what was stated on the note.",

    "text": "Okay, I don't know what happened to the food, but this time it was horrible. I ordered the catfish dinner, combo of fish and shrimp, and onion rings. First off, the meal with delivery and tip from GrubHub was around $50. I know, way too much, but oh well, I was in a cavalier mood and had good memories of my first visit. The onion rings were inedible. They were fried so hard that there was no onion to speak of. The shrimp apparently were cooked side by side with them, because the shrimp were dried out inside. The fish was over cooked, extremely crunchy on the outside, with the inside being mushy. The catfish was actually fine, as were the fries. $50 is waayyyy too much for a piece of catfish and 2 orders of fries. I don't know what else to say, but this was a major disappointment after waiting all this time to try them again.",

    "text": "My wife's family always regarded Christmas Eve as a day of abstinence from meat so we had fried fish along with other dishes on Christmas Eve.  I decided this year to get some fried fish and Yelp came through.  I called earlier in the day to see if they were open in the evening.  He wasn't sure when they'd close but he thought my 5 PM was fine.  I got there a few minutes before 5 and was greeted.  I placed my order and got a diet soda from the beverage cooler.  I was told it would be about 10 minutes.  In about that amount of time, I was brought the platter with 2 fried cod strips, 3 large fried shrimp, a large amount of French fries, and cole slaw.  There was also a container of tartar sauce and a container of ketchup.  There is an up charge of $4 for cod instead of Pacific white fish.  The breading was just right, the fish was perfectly cooked--brown on the outside and moist inside.  The shrimp were good and the fries was crisp.  I wasn't there too long.  I'm sure they'd be closing somewhat early because there was no other business on this Christmas Eve.  I am so glad I found Off the Hook.  Now I know where to go to have good fish and chips when I want.",

It used to be so clean - staff was clean, everything was nice. Now, it just had a weird vibe. They installed a large dry erase board with specials - but you can't read anything on it. The handwriting is sloppier than mine!  However where the real problem was ... my wife was in the bathroom ... I was trying to understand the specials from the board ... my baby was sitting in the stroller. I see the 'B' rating from the Southern Nevada Health District hanging ... OK, stuff happens. There is a handwritten note taped to the 'B' rating and it says it was because of a sewage problem and they will be reinspected soon. OK, I was waiting for my wife to come back from the bathroom and pulled up the Health District's website ... quick look showed 18 demerits!  18? I thought it was for a sewage issue? Nope - it was for 18 violations I won't list them here, but they were mostly sanitary issues - including lack of handwashing.  I asked the girl in the front about this - then the bearded man came out and said it was for sewage issues and he would show me the report. I told him that I highly doubt the Health District would post 18 demerits if it were not True.   We left.  So sad - this place used to be great for fish & chips.  I would not have cared about the 18 demerits - they would clean it up and learn ... but, why say it was something else and draw attention to it?",

As people arrived people left which was nice because we didn't have to wait for a table.    This place gets a 4 stars because their customer service deserves a 5 star.  The staff was really nice and helpful in explaining the menu.  The service was excellent!  The food came out quick and hot.    I really wanted to enjoy my meal.  There was no taste at all.  I had to add salt to my meal.  It could be that they had a new chef that night.   We got the mushrooms to start off with.  I ordered the combo with the oyster, shrimp, fish, and fries.  The food was cooked perfectly but the lack of flavor had me disappointed and dissatisfied.  It's a shame because I really wanted to love this place.  I will be back to give it another try!",

It's just a glorified take out restaurant with aspirations of a nice dine in restaurant.    The cod was bland and so was the coleslaw.  The tarter sauce and cocktail sauce came out of a jar and the hush puppies tasted like the frozen ones out of a bag from the grocery store.  Very unimpressive.  I will say that the restaurant did look clean and the food was super hot when brought to the table.  That is not enough of a reason to go back there, though.",

I almost always get the two piece cod which are large portions.  The cod is crunchy and moist.  Tastes fresh frozen, but what can you expect being far away from cod country.  You are served fries (chips) and demitasse of cole slaw with two cups of tartar sauce.  Served on a serving platter.  All for $14.  Beverages are ala carte. I got the bottled water$1.00.  The menu has many options from catfish too white fish. They also have appetizers to choose from. The ambiance is sparse with about ten tables.  They have tried to follow a nautical theme inside but that's about it. You can order take out or eat in.  The place gets busy from 11 am onward.  The tables were in need of wiping down, at least the one I sat at, and the table condiments like the malt vinegar bottle had finger prints.  Your food is brought to the table by the cashier/waiter. (Hope he washed his hands).  A guest mentioned that the business had been sold and Good Friday was their last day... Ironic that is.  I will return and see if the new owners will improve on or ruin something that was unique to the Southwest valley... Hope not!",

Anyhow, to the food.....I had the combo, one piece cod, 3 scallops, 2 huge fresh shrimp. ($15.00)  The shrimp were honestly some of the best I have had in Vegas; very good size, fresh and scrumptious. The cod was just OK, had better, had worse, homemade sauce that was ranch dressing based.   Afterwards he told me he had another sauce option, I am a hard core tarter sauce person, ranch doesn't get it.  The scallops were a waste of money, barely quarter sized and bland....  The cole slaw was OK, not special, fries decent.  My wife had the fish tacos,($9.00) the 3 tacos were very good although small.  They had  a slightly sweet chili sauce mix, cabbage, pico, avocodo.   I was a small business operator, and realize how tuff it is too make a go of it.    He has been open barely 3 months and paying his dues in the business world, I hope it works out for him.  His  seafood prices are very high compared to a larger operation, probably due to his low volume. He is still tweaking his menu and offerings.  I would go back for the shrimp....",

    "text": "There are three things that bothered me about my visit to this restaurant, and two things that I enjoyed.  *  I purchased a Groupon and when I got there, I found out there were restrictions on what I could order.  I went back and checked, and it was clearly stated on the Groupon, yet I was still annoyed.  I wasn't allowed to order the shrimp or scallops.  That made no sense to me.  Why are they limiting my selections?    *   This place is a fast food joint, yet they are trying to force table service into a facility that clearly isn't designed for it.  It just seems silly that I can't order my food at the counter and take my tray back to my table.  But okay, if you want to have a server come to my table and take my order, then spruce things up.  Put in real tables, not the Burger King things that are there.  Don't serve me food in plastic baskets.  Don't give me plastic knives and forks.    *   The prices are outrageous.  It's a fish fry.  Two pieces of fried cod, french fries, cole slaw, and a pop are going to run you seventeen dollars.  Everything is expensive on the menu.  For the prices they charge, I expect a lot better ambiance and presentation.    *   Our server was nice.  Charlotte, I believe was her name.  She seemed invested in making us have a positive experience, so that was welcomed.  *   The food was somewhere between good and excellent.  The fries were nothing special but fine.  The cole slaw was above average.  The fried cod was perfectly cooked - flaky and moist.  The batter was just okay for me.  After a conversation, I was allowed to order the blackened shrimp appetizer and it was outstanding.  The tartar sauce, also, was very impressive.  It was thinner than one would normally see with nice lemon notes to it.  A far cry from your typical mayonnaise mixed with pickle relish.    I wouldn't be against returning because the food is good.  However, I can't bring myself to pay these kind of prices when I can get the same type of food at Long John Silver's for a fraction of the cost.  Not as good - no doubt.  But it's fried fish.  I find it difficult to get too snobby about any food you batter and throw in hot oil.",

I had the catfish.  Lightly breaded in cornmeal and fried perfectly.  Not greasy at all.  And the fries and hush puppies were just as good.  See you soon for another plate of yummy fried food.",

The breading is light and crunchy, just perfect. Freshest Cole slaw I've ever had, like home made and not over saturated with mayonnaise. The French fries tasted like fresh potatoes as they should, thick and really good. I have nothing negative to say, it's all good. Dan made Clam Chowder for the menu, a new item when we walked in. He gave me a sample...it was as good as any New Engand Chowder I have had and I'm from there so when I say it was good....it is.  Even if this location is out of the way, it is well worth the few extra miles. I highly recommend this great restaurant!!!",

The theme all around is fun and kid friendly. They tend to your needs - they ask you if you're dining in or taking out when you walk in, which sets the experience. When dining in, you pick a seat and they come to you and take your order. The food is quickly made, fresh to order and the servers and cook are hilarious! There is more than enough selection on the menu... and the portions are well worth what you pay for. I usually can't even finish the plate because there's so much - but that just gives me the option to save for later... come hungry! This is my go-to fish & chips spot. My daughter LOVES it!",

    "text": "I can't find anything to complain about.  I went to eat here with my kids and they are picky eaters.  They hate seafood but for some reason they like fish and chips.  I read the reviews going into Off the Hook so I was mindful of some of the negative comments.   We ate the Family basket of Fish and Chips.  The fish tasted clean and I agree with the management rebuttal about lack of taste. Cod should be clean and fresh tasting.  It's not like Salmon that has a more flavorful taste. The condiments were good at adding flavor to the Cod.  The Coleslaw was not overbearing, not the most flavorful but again, tasted clean and fresh.  I can handle that.     The family basket came with hush puppies, maybe a little overlooked, but not enough to deduct a star because they still tasted great.  I dipped the fish and hush puppies in a tangy orange colored type sauce that's probably got ketchup, mayonnaise and some seasoning mixed in. That was really good.  The fries were cooked right, not over cooked, not soggy and not undercooked.   My kids like this place and so did I.  Like I said, they are picky.  As far as the price, almost $30 for the family basket not including drinks. Not cheap but not too expensive.  You go to any bar in town and Fish and Chips is easily $10/person.  So Off the Hook was about the same.  I would definitely come here again.",

Service was polite enough, and the menu is mostly fried items (including desserts).  Opted for fish and chips on my visit- their specialty. The pieces of cod used were of good quality, and the fry was good. But the batter was bland and tasteless. Good crispness, and not too thick, but no seasoning. Chips were generic fries found frequently elsewhere- not sure what I was expecting but was underwhelmed. I will say that the tartar sauce was a homemade ranch dressing?-  smooth for dipping instead of chunky and light on flavor, but most definitely NOT tartar sauce. WTH? Interested in trying their fish tacos, hoping they add a chowder to the menu.  Felt this place was a bit heavy on prices: meals from 1-5 pieces range from $8 to almost $30, with apps like onion rings (1/3 pound?) and fried zucchini going for $7 and cajun prawns for just under $10. I didn't feel that the quality was yet up enough to justify the prices.",

I walk in, the place is empty, no employees nor customers. I announce my presence since the bells on the door didn't seem to attract any attention. Still nothing! About 2 minutes later a guy walks out of the restroom & tells me they are closed for lunch. CLOSED FOR LUNCH??? Really? At 1 pm on a Saturday a lunch type of place is closed for lunch! UNBELIEVABLE! I am 58 yrs old. I have worked all over this country, Europe & Asia. THIS IS A FIRST! Well i gave them a chance! I wont again!",

    "text": "Arguably the best fish n chips I've had. I ordered the large because I came in with an appetite, and I was planning on letting my aunt have a bite of my food anyway. (Large comes with 4pc of fish, chips, and a side of their homemade Cole slaw +tartar sauce)  I expected each piece of fish to be average sized (every other place I've been to have had similar sized pieces) but these came out scorching hot, and each piece was the size of a toddler's arm! They don't over-cook their fish like some places, so every piece was perfectly crispy on the outside and flakey/ JUST cooked through on the inside. Not dry at all! After pummeling through 3/4 of the chips and 2 toddler-arm sized pieces of fish, I was stuffed and satisfied.   I also have to commend them on their tartar sauce and Cole slaw. The tartar sauce is thick and on point. The Cole slaw actually has good flavor, and is pickled enough unlike most other slaws that just come out tasting kind of like bland, wet cabbage.   Overall 5 stars for quality of good, as well as service. Definitely recommend.",

The scallops were plump and fish was huge for only $1.99 a piece. My roll was full of Lobster & the Hawaiian roll itself was toasted to perfection. It wasn't hard or soggy. The sauces in the lobster wasn't over powering so you could taste the actual lobster! Will come again! A must try!",

    "text": "I placed a delivery order through Amazon Restaurants. Within a few minutes of the confirmation text that my order from Amazon and the withdrawal on my checking account I received a text telling me that part of my order was cancelled. I had no idea what was going on because the amount didn't match any of the items ordered(it was less).    I immediately called the restaurant to find out what happened. The woman who answered the phone was not very pleasant. She explained that they couldn't make that item so it was voided. I was disappointed that the restaurant wouldn't even attempt to contact me to see if I was interested in substituting for something else. I guess one of the two people who intended to eat were just supposed to go hungry. Also the amount of the refund did not match the price of the item. Based on the lack of customer service and math problems on their end I decided to cancel the entire order. I told the employee that I needed to feed two people and a partial order wouldn't work.  I asked about replacing it with something for the same price (what I paid not what they refunded). She said since they already refunded that item there was nothing they could do. I told her I would be cancelling the order and needed a full (correct) refund. She hung up on me.   The refund and cancelled order was not sent to Amazon Restaurants. I waited for almost an hour (they would be closing soon) then had to contact Amazon. Amazon had no record of my cancellation. It took 30 minutes on the phone until they could confirm with the restaurant that they weren't making my food.  I was very much looking forward to trying this place but after this, I'll find somewhere else.  Addition to review because of response: this was not last night or tonight. This is just when I got around to leaving a review. The tone of your response doesn't do much to redeem the experience.  Sometimes saying nothing is better.",

    "text": "I was so hungry for good fish and chips. A friend recommended this place but when I talked to another friend he said it was awful. BUT I wanted some fish and chips. I am from CA and a fisher person all my younger days. Fished from Oxnard to down Mexico, from the shores to the Anacapa Islands and beyond. I had fish fries for 25 people after a good trip. My fish and chips were well known. I know fish. Fished since I was a little kid with a bamboo pole and a can of worms back in MN. Fishing was a passion. Back to my experience last night. Ordered thru Grub Hub which was great and fast. But when I opened my bag and went to move the fish off the fries it was dripping in grease. My fries were all soggy and inedible. I tried to eat the fish without the batter but the greasy taste came thru and I had to stop. Also the fish was tough, chewy. Not like good COD at all. So being hungry I went to the teeny tub of cole slaw. It was tasteless, bland but ate it all anyway. I saved a few fries at the edges of the carton that escaped the grease drippings. One fish piece broke in half from all the grease in the batter. It was mush. Enough. Needless to say Off The Hook is OFF my list of eateries. So disappointed when I wanted good fish and chips so badly.  Also they could hold some of the fries and add more good cole slaw if possible. IMO also over priced.",

    "text": "Ordered thru grub hub last week after recovering from the flu and craving fish and chips. Never ate here before so I was taking a huge gamble. Ordered the 4 piece cod with fries and also the fried zucchini. Let me say the fish was so fabulous. It was delivered hot and fresh which I was really happy about. So tasty, came with malt vinegar but I used my own fresh lemon juice. Fries were the big steak fries and they were ok but not hot. It's tough to get hot fries delivered so I wasn't surprised. The zucchini however was not good. It has that Italian breading on them which I hate on zucchini and they were dry.  Get the fish! You won't be disappointed.",

The bottom of the container was in the pie, and my biggest issue No \"malt vinegar\". I don't eat the fish without. I called in to have a young girl answer. I told her my experience and she said \"OK\". With little care that I was not eating the food because they failed to fulfill the order. Will not eat a 3rd day anytime soon. Lost a fan!",

    "text": "The food here is actually really good.  But the customer service is awful.  We've eaten here before and enjoyed the food.  So we ordered our normal fish and chicken for delivery.  What we got in the chicken was half the size of the normal order. When we called to ask if if had changed we were informed they had run out of their regular chicken and this was their back -up. (They didn't contract us to let us know we were getting half the food that we purchased, just sent it. ) We hung up, and a few minutes later noticed they had also neglected to send us the tartar sauce.  We called back again, expressing our dissatisfaction that we were getting less than we had paid for,  and that we both hadn't been informed,  and the rest of our order wasn't correct.  Their response -- No offer to correct it either today or in the future.  No sincere apology.  Just a \"Well we were out of chicken and those were our last back-up pieces so you couldn't have extra.\" I've eaten here before, due to the service,  I won't be eating here again.",

Off the hook is exactly what the name says, it's OFF THE HOOK!!!  This might be the first and only time I leave a fish n chips joint with a full belly but not with a belly full of grease.  I don't know how they do it but they do it great.  Will be coming back at least once a week for more! Easy 5 stars.",

    "text": "Absolutely the best fish & chips I've had in Las Vegas thus far.  I've been looking for really good fish & chips since moving here a few months ago.  I've tried Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY), RiRa (Mandalay Bay), McMullan and Crown & Anchor.  Off the Hook is hands down the best (a 8 out of 10)!  Nine Fine Irishmen is not bad (7 out of 10), and you can forget the rest (probably better off buying the frozen fish from the grocery store and oven bake them yourself).  The fish at Off the Hook is super tender & moist on the inside but very nice and crispy on the outside in a light batter.  Exactly the way it should be done.  If you're a serious fan of British-style fish & chips, do yourself a favor and check out this neighborhood joint.  I'm certainly glad I did today...finally found myself some awesome fish & chips here in Sin City.",

    "text": "It was raining out which made me think of the coast. Yelping the best clam chowder in Las Vegas brought me here. The food came out really fast, like in 5 minutes, so this would be a great lunch break spot. The clam chowder was really good, not too thick and not too thin with lots of clams. Not the best I've ever had but the best I've had in town! The Texas toast it came with was delicious, especially dipped in the chowder. Keep in mind the chowder is only available Friday and Saturday, which I did not know from reading Yelp reviews, but luckily we happened to go on a Friday. My husband was going to get the fish and chips because how could you not given the name of the restaurant, but he saw on the specials board a lobster roll and couldn't resist. The roll itself was small but with lots of lobster. My husband had suspected it might be fake lobster given the quantity and price and a taste not of lobster he couldn't identify. I edited my original review after the owner commented saying they add crab to the role to keep the price down, which is likely the taste he wasn't used to in a lobster roll. He still said it was good but next time would get the fish and chips. The chips the lobster roll came with were good, he didn't eat the coleslaw so we can't speak to it.",
