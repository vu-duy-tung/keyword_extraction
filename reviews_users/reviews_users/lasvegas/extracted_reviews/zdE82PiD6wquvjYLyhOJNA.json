    "text": "Great quality food every time we visit Las Vegas.  It has been our go to spot for three years and counting. It's about a 15-20 in drive from the strip.  They are well known for their Korean and Mexican fusion dishes such as their bulgogi burritos or bulgogi fries but they also serve traditional Korean and Mexican dishes like kimchi, tacos, burritos, enchiladas etc.  We always order the regular bulgogi with rice dish because it's cheap and always packed with flavor.  I like to order the bulgogi fries.  My favorite!  Very similar to Carne Asada fries but with bulgogi meat.  And if you dine in, they give you free guac, salsa, and chips to snack on.  Prices are reasonable and food won't disappoint.",

I enjoyed the pork, bulgogi and chicken in that order.  I wondered what their regular Chinese or non-fusion dishes are like but I will never know.  If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.  Free fried wontons with a check-in.  Afternoon lunch coma sets in upon completion.    Corona or Hite beer would complement their stuff perfectly.  Maybe they let people byob?",

Our bill was about 20 dollars. While waiting for our food to cook, we were given complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips were like fried wontons and I would definitely pay for more.  The only disclaimer I can leave is not about the restaurant itself. I had a lady come up to my parked car right as I was about to drive away. She of course asked for money. And there seems to be influx of beggars in the surrounding streets. Don't worry my friends, I bought her a chicken sandwich before leaving.",

We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill.   My friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I'm an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn't tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn't finish their neither.   I was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was.   My advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn't worth the drive up to North Las Vegas.",

So in my book, KoMex is awesome :)  They're known for their tacos, which is what they recommend I try first. Your choice of Korean-style chicken, bulgogi beef, or spicy pork. With corn tortillas, $1.29. With flour tortillas, $1.99 each.  They have some traditional Mexican and Korean dishes you can order, but I think the popular items were all on the left-side of the menu, basically Asian- style tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.   I ordered three tacos, trying each meat. Delicious! I'm looking forward to going back :)",

We also got the Bulgogi Nachos which were good but only the first layer...the toppings did not infect the whole order of nachos:( There was just not enough. The rest were just well chips...which are free when you dine in.  Although everything was delicious, it's also very heavy...Mexican food usually is.

I thought my tacos I had ( al pastor, daegji gogi and bulgogi) were good. We were first served by who I think is the owner and she was friendly and nice then there was a new girl and when tabulating our bill (they hand write it) it was way over. Also there was dustbunnys at the corner of our table. I'm okay with hole in the walls, but really, a dustbunny?   We decided to try again and this time it was much cleaner. Food was still consistent. Now they have vegetarian options which is a plus so I had a tofu fusion style and a rice/beans and vegetable. The tofu was good, the veggie one only came with rice on mine but the veggies on it were fresh (stir fry mix- think broccoli, cabbage, carrot, etc).   BF loved the shrimp fusion style so now he says anytime we come here he has to get that. There is a check in special for free wontons. They are little meat filled ones (4 pcs) with some sweet chili sauce.   The BF and I thought his family would like it so we brought them and they enjoyed it. Mom got enchiladas and she's a green sauce girl and with our luck brought them when they were making some but she said it would be better with it. The surprising standout was grandmas mongolian beef. I took a bite and that was really tender and flavorful. BF and I stuck to the fusion tacos.   Overall, I think this place is solid cheap eats with a little something for everyone.",

So I did.  :P   They start you off w/ Salsa and Guac-  Fusion Bulgogi Fries: Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Spicy Korean Hot Sauce-   DUDE.  yes.  it's ALL of that... and more.   like, I could've just walked out w/ ALL that in my belly... but of course I ordered more.  It's good.  Lots of meat, and a very large plate full.    I had 3 tacos!  1 of each! pork, chicken, beef! fusion tacos Dak-gogi tacos-were my fav of the 3 marinated tacos: Flour Tortilla with Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream -- DROOL.  I love tacos.  like, my 5th love.    We also had Kim Chee Fried Rice..... YUM!  I make a pretty mean fried rice... so this... is ooooookaaaaaaay....  It's a little oily, but still very yummy.   You know what, to be honest with you I don't remember what they had... and it doesn't even matter because I requested we go there this night.  And I was very happy.... I think they were too.  ?

I tried a little of everything so I ordered:  Bulgogi burrito Bulgogi fries Bulgogi Kim Chee taco.   The burrito was tasty and bulgogi was tender. I love that it had Kim Chee (you have to ask for it) which gave it an extra tang. I wasn't too fond of the rice, as it was lacking in flavor and a bit mushy.  The fries looked delicious at first, but was hard to eat as the cheese quickly cools making it hard to have a perfect bite. I thought it was just ok, and would easily skip on my next visit.  The taco was pretty tasty, the only con is that there's too much liquid from the Kim Chee that it makes the tortilla soggy and breaks it. It was pretty messy.   All in all, the items were good, but I'd just stick to the burrito. I'm eager to try more items off their menu since I enjoy the Korean Mexican fusion concept.",

Simply said, it is because KoMex has to be one of the best hole in the wall establishments that Vegas has to offer.  The kitchen here is very small, and service can be slow. Call ahead if you are pressed for time and budget between 20-30 minutes just to be safe.   However, the amazing food well makes up for the transgression of slower service.  I have yet to have a dish here that disappoints.   The thing I love most about KoMex is that they are locally owned and have not abandoned the neighborhood, even as it has become a little on the gritty side.  I work very close to here and have a special spot in my heart for this part of town.    I guess I could best describe this restaurant as \"El Seoul\" food.",

Such a strange location on washington and decatur and parking lot is small but totally worth the drive. From the moment my brother and i walked in the service could not have been better.   Had the calypso lemonade to drink and my brother had a mexican coke. I love, love, love lemonade and let me tell you this one ranks up their. A little sweeter than i prefer but still delicious. Mexican coke = always a winner.  Bulgogi fries = holy moly my friend these things are amazing, i love french fries and adding bulgogi and cheese and salsa and lots of onions, won me over real quick  Pork belly tacos, perfect amount of different flavors and the tortillas are grade A  Carne asada tacos, meat was perfectly flavored and cooked  Not that i mind spending $ on great food and great service but this is place is so cheap its crazy that they make $...g2 respect great service, i tipped 100% of the bill and when the server took the bill at the end of the meal and looked at the bill in the side station, she yelled \"thank you derek\", she then came over and we chatted a bit.   Forget the servers name but wonderful woman, so friendly and genuine. Couldn't ask for someone better.  Even if your on the strip, it is worth the drive, trust me. This location is a little better on service than the new one but food is equally great at both.",

The top of the chimichanga was drenched in a delicious sauce along with melted shredded cheese, some lettuce and pico de gallo.  I highly recommend the chimichanga here. Only thing that sucks is that the oil eventually hardens the bottom of the chimichanga crust and makes it difficult to cut.",

I ordered the bulgolgi burrito to-go.  I was impressed!  The finely chopped veggies were fresh and delightful, and the bulgolgi was well prepared, although maybe a little saucier than I like.  While not the best Korean food I have had in Vegas, it is better than most.  I enjoyed their Mexican take on the dish: wrapped in a flour tortilla burrito in style.  The best thing about this place is the price, about half the cost of my favorite Korean spot!  For your hard earned bucks, you get an amazing quality of food here.  Be careful coming here on the weekend for lunch, the place will be jammed packed!    Thanks to my Yelp friends for giving me a heads up on this one.  I will definitely make this a usual spot especially for a super fast and cheap meal by my house!",

I could make a meal out of their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos (even in its half order size), and their prices are so reasonable you can never turn this place down.  It's a hole-in-the-wall sort of setting and the water they give you in your cup is from large, gallon, filtered water bottles. AWESOME, considering that Las Vegas' tap water is bad enough to ruin any meal. (IMO)  I have returned to this place numerous times with my boyfriend (who is very hard to please, food wise) and have always had a great experience.  Their Fusion Tacos are so good! I always opt for the spicy pork. I've also tried the Fusion Burrito, and the sheer size of it even made my boyfriends' mouth drop.   I love Fusion spots, and this, right here, is the epitome of a fusion flavor explosion!",

Followed by their fusion tacos - one of each meat with the bulgogi being my favorite meat.  My wife really enjoyed the fusion burrito with chicken.

It sounded like they might be planning on becoming an actual restaurant, rather than a grocery counter with food. Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food. Huh! The owners are Korean, but they speak Spanish. Linda, the owner, said her husband was cooking her some food and everyone was interested. And their fusion food was born. I started with a bulgogi taco. I think I prefer Hanshik BUT...the taco was $1 and muy delicious. I then got a bulgogi teriyaki bowl and a pork tamale to go. The teriyaki bowl was $5 and the tamale was another $1. That food will probably last me for 4 meals. The teriyaki bowl is delicious. I mean, best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. Yum. Yum. Yum! And the tamale was even better than the teriyaki bowl!  I freakin' love this place. Cheap, delicious, creative, good eats. I couldn't ask for anything better. I will be back..again and again.  Edit: This place has moved and is now a full-time restaurant, rather than carniceria with a food counter. If you're looking for atmosphere, forget it. If you're looking for delicious comfort food, go check it out!  I haven't eaten everything on the menu (yet), but most everything I've had seems to have Korean influences, which makes sense given that the owners are Korean.  I got some wonton soup today. It's really not much like traditional wonton and Korean flavor peeks through....but it's delicious, comforting, and a bargain.  The tacos are now $1.25 and still muy delicious!   I came in for takeout, but Lynda still brought me out a side of chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were kind of soggy in the middle like homemade...and that's the way I like my chips, but others might disagree.  Still, a ton of food, and a ton of flavor, for very little money. And I still love this place!",

I have had the bulgogi  and spicy pork tacos which are loaded with meat and other ingredients; these are delicious.  I have also had the spicy pork fusion torta, which was huge and very tasty.  This was a great mixture of flavors.  The fusion (bulgogi) chimichanga was also great.  The dishes are very flavorful and loaded with ingredients.  All of the dishes I have tried thus far have a great mixture of texture, spice and complexity of flavor.  This is deffinitely one of my go to places when in that part of Las Vegas",

Never would have guessed that it was so good, it's not a looker from the outside... in a strip mall. But, Yelp didn't let us down! I had the bulgogi tacos with kimchi. SO GOOD. The owners are super nice. And there's a newspaper article cut out and framed on the wall describing how this little gem of a restaurant was actually saved by Yelpers. This place is cheap, delicious and definitely worth checking out if you're in Vegas.",

The meat was not tender at all, especially the pork. The chicken is tasteless. The misubi was way too salty. The portions was not huge as many yelp reviews said it was. The only thing I liked from the mountain of food is the beef kimchi fried rice. But it wasn't spectacular. Any decent korean place will taste just as good.   Here is what we ordered: Beef kimichi fried rice: very good  Combo two meat plate: horrible. Chicken was tasteless. The pork was like ground pork, mushy, which was really weird.   Pork belly misubi: way too salty. I took one bite and threw it away.   Chicken wings: okay. Drenched in sauce.   Shrimp and chicken tacos: okay. Nothing too special about it that you can't get from a taco truck.",

    "text": "This isn't a full review! This is a pre-review based off of a short encounter. The pre-review will cover my experience today, when I dropped off my donation for \"Yelp's Toys for Tater Tots Drive!\"  Ok, so I dropped off my toy around 3pm today. As I entered, I stood at the counter for maybe 30 seconds before I was greeted by the hostess. I inquired about where to leave the toy that I brought. The young lady didn't know. She said to ask a man that had just finished eating at a table.  As the man approached, the lady asked him about the Toy Drive. He kindly pointed out a box that was on the top of a table (or something similar). He then said, \"You get a tot too.\" I did know that I was suppose to get a tot but he was very friendly with reminding me. So, he yelled to the back for someone to make the tot. He asked me to have a seat and he quoted me 5-6 minutes in waiting time.  After maybe 5 minutes, he bought out the bag, containing the tot. He gracefully thanked me and vice versa. I then walked out, got in my car and pulled off, without even checking the food.  I had my friend with me, so she actually wanted to opened my container of tots, because everyone knows that tots or any potato is best hot. As she busted through the bag, we were overtaken by an incredible aroma. I've never smelled, or tasted, for that matter, any tots that smelled as wonderfully as these did.  She finally opened the container and we were both surprised to see that the tots were covered with a combination of ground beef, bacon, peppers and cheese. I don't know if they were suppose to come that way, but we were certainly glad they did.  We both took a few bites and it was absolutely delicious. The spicy mixed perfectly with the meat and they all complemented the tots to perfection. The whole dish was seasoned JUST RIGHT! We were fighting over who got the last bite, it was so good!  I don't know if the man (potentially the owner) realized he had just earned himself a loyal, satisfied customer, or not. But, he surely did! And just to think, we probably would not have known anything about this place, if it wasn't for the toy drive. My friend and I have already added this place to our short list of favorites. We're definitely looking forward to going back in the near future.",

I love that it's some hole-in-the-wall. People get their panties in a bunch when the spot isn't classy enough. Like hello, you're eating tacos, burritos, etc...how fancy do you need the parking lot and area to be?  I usually order the bulgogi tacos (marinated korean beef) and their fusion take on tostada. It's basically crispy rice with all the taco fixings on top. The crispy rice and all that jazz on top is perfect according to my taste buds. My son orders the fusion burrito and this thing is more like a chimichanga! In other words, it's huge.  We have also gone to their second location and the quality of food is no different than this location. You know how sometimes businesses open other locations then all of a sudden their own menu doesn't translate properly by the time you get it--not here. I believe it's a husband-wife duo. The wife runs the buffalo location because I usually see her there, and the husband runs this location. Both are nice people! Don't have any complaints about their service.   They do offer Mexican food, but seriously...please do not come to a korean-mexican fusion joint by ordering team Mexican or team korean. Gotta combine the powers and try it out for yourself. Deelish.  Definitely kid friendly, but I wouldn't bring a stroller in on a busy day. Certainly a place on a day when you feel like having some cheap eats.",

However, I didn't really care for the salsa, it had a weird artificial, vinegar preserved taste.   This is what we ordered:  (make sure to add hot sauce and salsa on your tacos and kimchi fried rice, before you eat them! They all needed that extra pop of flavor and salt. The salsa tray is available, you can either grab it yourself or ask for it.)  Bulgogi tacos - the beef had great flavor! It was tender and the rest of the taco was delicious.   Pork tacos - the pork marinade was a little weak, but add on some hot sauce and salsa and it's just right.   Pork belly tacos - these had yummy pork belly bits in the taco. My boyfriend said he only got a bite of just fat, but I had a different bite and it was tasty.  Kimchi bulgogi fried rice - it had nice chunks of kimchi with beef and a fried egg on top. I topped it with some hot sauce and it was addicting!   Wonton soup - the soup came out piping hot. The broth tasted comforting and the flavor was good. The wontons were homemade and the meatball was yummy as well. I would love eating this when I'm sick.   I would definitely come back to try their other fusion favorites.",

Just like your traditional BLT. The Komex twist adds a Sriracha mayo on the side. Oh yeah!   Portion wise, pretty generous serving of their delish Bulgogi and thick fatty pieces of Pork Belly for sure! It was a challenge to eat it without the meat fillins falling out. I eventually ate it up with my fork and used the Sriracha mayo as a dipping sauce. Either way, this dish is too good to miss. Better get there before it's gone.

Not to mention that these two cuisines with their affinity for their optional fiery kicks just pair well together.  In case that is not sufficiently enticing, there are some Chinese (friend wontons disappeared quickly off the plate here) and American added in for good measure.  Did I mention that it is reasonably priced too.   First timers should test drive their Fusion Tacos or Burritos, prepared with Korean BBQ inspired fillings in traditional Mexican corn tortilla shells or flour tortillas.  Optional Kimchi can be added to the order, but I think it tasted better on the side and not in the tacos or burritos.  I rarely order nachos, but their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos was worth deviating from my customary ordering habits.  This small mom and pop restaurant is operated by a nice couple.  It is located in what appears to be a rather worn out looking strip mall, but don't let that deter you from what will most likely be a surprisingly good experience eating out. Enjoy!",

We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it.   The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch.   Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :(",

This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lol  When we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...  -The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good -Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!  We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP.

Once my friend mentioned the place I checked it on yelp and the ratings were 4 to 5 stars so I was pretty excited to check the place out and try the food.   For starters we ordered the bulgogi fries and nachos both half orders. Beef bulgogi kimchi fried rice, combo fried rice, spam musubi that we all shared. The fries were worth trying, as for the nachos they were good as well. But if I had to pick between the two to try its would definitely be the fries. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, especially being a kimchi lover. The combo fried rice came with veggies, beef, and shrimp which was good.

We set the GPS coordinates for Komex and as road-weary travelers, peeled ourselves out of the car and ambled in to the restaurant.  We don't get much (read:any) Korean-Mexican fusion in Salt Lake, so I was really looking forward to seeing what exactly it was. The food around us smelled terrific, and after eating right for days on end, it was time to splurge. Spend those calories!  So what does a fella order when he wants to taste around? The bulgogi burrito, of course. Oh, and then a couple of tacos as an add-on to taste the other meats. One dak-gogi and one daeji-gogi, just to be safe.   It wasn't pretty the way I unhinged my jaw and swallowed that whole burrito. But it wa oh-so-delicious. The side of kimchi made all the difference in the world, too. Beautiful, baby! And the tacos were tasty as well. I favored the pork over the chicken, but really--it was all unique and bursting with new flavors.  I also got to sample the vegetarian noodles which had a slightly smoky flavor and were served in an approximate 47lb. mound. Portions are generous here, and there's plenty o' bang for not hardly a buck.",

But sadly they have eliminated the Yelp check in offer for the free wontons. Really bummed me out - show love to your Yelp fans!  Also, one of things which I loved which was the free bottled water has now been replaced by tap water. They used to serve water in a glass straight from one of those small Costco water bottles, now its tap. I understand that it may have been costly but tap water sucks and they could have at least gotten a Brita as some people do expect this.  But of course the food is still awesome. Great fusion you can't get anywhere else!",

Either way, I ordered the bulgogi fries again, but this time without the kim chi.  I love kim chi, but these were WAY better without the KC...  Went with a bulgogi burrito...WAY better than the tacos IMO.  I had a few tacos this time, as well as remembering last time, and it is way better in the burrito fashion to me.  I also tried some fish tacos...the regular fish taco was ok, not bad at all, but I prob won't order it again.  However, the calamari taco comes with a different sauce, and it was super good.  Very tender meat, and the sauce pulls it all together.  Bravo!  I'll be back again :)",

    "text": "You come across a place called \"KoMex fusion\"....Dazed? Confused? Mystified? Let me clear this up for you, KoMex fusion is Korean, Mexican, Chinese and American food all smashed together. Not clear enough? Well, then it is what everyone says it is, freakin awesome. It's quite a trek from the strip, so be prepared to hop on the freeway, but trust me, you will save much more money on food so the extra gas will be more than paid for. My family of four tried many different dishes, we all ordered drinks and our bill was $20. I'm not even joking. The problems with KoMex is that it is not in the best area and it is super small. There is often a line out the door. I suggest you go at off times, try everything and tip heavy (they work their butts off here).",

Due to our restricted lunch time we placed an order in advance to eat in the establishment. When we arrived the food was packed to go and we all paid for our meals. We explained that we were going to stay and eat and immediately received attitude. Let me say this...in our party there was a Hispanic male, white woman and two black women. The male in our party asked if we could have chips (which are complimentary for dine-in). The gentlemen (owner) behind the counter proceed to yell and state to the Hispanic male in our party that this was not Taco Bell and he couldn't have things his way....very racists. Then he proceeded to call him an asshole and walk up on him yelling in his face. Let's say it was really close to becoming physical. Thankfully there was a cop in the establishment who deescalated the situation. We will make sure to pass the word on in our business so they understand the type of people who own and work for this restaurant. Dont support this business. I work for an organization that is well over 4000 employees and I train new employees every year. There have numerous occasions I have been asked what was a great place to eat and I would refer them to this establishment but not any longer. Sad to believe racism, prejudice and terrible service still exist to this day.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place.  I've read all about it on Yelp.  My girlfriend has turned me on to Korean cuisine.  I like Mexican cuisine, but she does not.  So, I had to rope my father into going with me.  Komex is conveniently located off the 95 at Decatur.  Just head North on Decatur and look for it on the left just before Washington.  There is not enough parking for that shopping center.  The decor is typical mom and pop, not super fancy, but it is clean.  Mostly booths.  Have a seat and a server will come by soon.  The place is small, perhaps six or eight booths/tables.  We ordered two Mexican sodas: one mandarin orange and the other lime.  They came in bottles and they provided glasses with ice and straws.  I tried both flavors and liked both.  The carbonation was strong.  The server brought out complimentary chips, saIsa, and guacamole.  The chips were more like fried pitas.  They seemed fresh, but were cold.  The salsa was very flavorful.  The guacamole was ordinary, but how many other places give you guacamole for free?  So, I'm not complaining.  If you check in on Yelp you get a free order of fried wontons.  I showed our server.  I went to the bathroom and was disgusted by the smell (the only unpleasant part of my experience at Komex).  The fried wontons were crispy, hearty, and flavorful.  Not overly greasy.  The dipping sauce was really tasty, kind of sweet and spicy hot at the same time.  We ordered two fusion tacos (one beef and the other chicken), bulgogi burrito, and pork torta.  The food all came out at different times, which I did not mind.  There were only two people working the front-of-house and the place was full (was lunch time).  Everything was flavorful.  I could taste the Korean and the Mexican and it worked.  The burrito and torta were huge portions.  Our server brought out some sauces, which were all good.  Upon finishing our server brought out a complimentary dessert, which was an orange sliced in half and the pieces cut out and then put back in.  Two little plastic swords were stuck in two of the slices.  Really nice touch.  Usually I skip dessert after eating so much food, but I told myself I had to eat my daily allowance for fruit and enjoyed it.  It was fresh.  Fortune cookies came with the bill.  Torta $5.99; burrito $4.99; tacos $1.29 each; sodas $1.29 each; wontons free with Yelp check in; fortune cookies free; orange free; and chips, salsa, & guacamole free.  The total bill was under $18 and we were stuffed.  Our server was super friendly and helpful.  It was totally busy, but we ate and got back to work within an hour.  This place gets five stars all the way \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\"",

I also always try to order something new and so far, i haven't ordered anything i didnt like. Luckily, everything is so cheap here, i dont feel guilty for ordering a bunch of stuff! Usually when a place has good food for cheap prices, the staff isn't so great... But not this place!

There are \"standard\" Mexican, Chinese, and Korean items for those not brave enough to go with a bulgogi tostada, but the whole point of trying this place is to dive in and go for it. We even took our plain-eating American friend, who had never eaten Korean food, and she finished the entire plate of bulgogi, rice and kimchi (she's tiny and the portion is huge). Try several things to share, but beware, the portions are really huge, so ask for half size.  The dining area's pretty small so go at off-times if you can. Not the prettiest neighborhood but we never felt unsafe. It's in the corner of a strip mall, but no parking issues. We drove there twice from the Strip and it was totally worth it, definitely check it out!",

We ordered the bulgogi cheese steak, kimchee fried rice, and a half order of the bulgogi nachos. The sandwich was insanely delicious. The nachos were loaded with toppings and were excellent. The kimchee fried rice had a fried egg on top and were perfectly seasoned.  The chef and waitress were friendly and very accommodating.  This will definitely be one of my new weekly stops.",

    "text": "The Korean fusion thing has been getting a little out of hand. Since Kogi truck, korean-inspired foods have been popping up everywhere. I'm a little bit of a Korean-food purist--why mess with a good thing? But I can't complain (too much) about the grub they serve up at KoMex.  FUSION TACOS: You have the option of beef, chicken, or pork. I sampled one of each in addition to a plain old shrimp taco. I added fried kimchi on one of them for an extra $1.. I won't ever do that again. Kimchi is good with a lot of things; just not on my tacos. The kimchi was a little too sour for my taste. The tacos without that extra Korean element were quite good though! The cabbage was crunchy, and it was balanced with just the perfect amount of onion, cilantro, and darn good pico.  VARIETY: This tiny restaurant has a huge menu. Korean Mexican food, Mexican food, American food, and Chinese. Now if they only made donuts... I want to say they're DTM. But the food here is good. I tried a little of everything; nothing great, nothing awful. The 'KoMex' gimmick isn't anything special. But if you're craving a cheeseburger with your KBBQ taco and taquitos, KoMex is a one stop shop.",

I love the concept of fusion foods, makes me feel more American. :P It's awesome to see different cultures mix so well together!   I came here before leaving Las Vegas. It's no where near the strip (thank god...I was growing quite weary of obnoxiously drunk and loud Jersey Shore rejects swarming the streets).   We ordered:  Chow Fettuccine - Chow mein but with italian fettucine noodles wok stir fried with red onions, cabbage, korean bbq beef, shrimp and chicken. All for $10!! Can't beat that, especially if you lost all your dough in Vegas.  TOFU ENCHILADAS!!  - Sounds weird, tastes awesome. The plate comes with rice, beans, tomato, shredded lettuce and red sauce. (forgot how much it was tho)   There was also complimentary chunky salsa and guac and chips (with free refills!). And might I say, it was the most delicious FUH-REE guac and salsa I've eva haaaaaaad!   Come here if yous a broke mofo.... or if you just love fusion food!",

They have a sign that says the food is made to order to maintain freshness and that it is not fast food however I received my food in 6 minutes and 27 seconds. This makes me question as to if it is really cooked to order or if the food is prepared beforehand. I had the regular beef bulgogi with rice and it was good however I got some cartilage in my meat. The food was really delicious overall and I will return in the near future. I absolutely recommend coming here!",

The lady who took care of me today (the owner I'd assume) greeted me with a smile and, being my first time, was welcoming and recommended some amazing dishes.   I tried the bulgogi, pork and shrimp tacos and they were all very good. In fact, I got a second shrimp taco due to its amazing flavor. I also ordered fried pork wontons which were freshly fried and the pork was juicy and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and come try this place.",

Lots of choices so it was a bit of a hard decision - ended up going with the Korean beef half & half nachos (1/2 fries 1/2 chips) - meat was absolutely to die for!!  Make sure you try the pork belly taco and if you have enough room order a chicken taco as well. Only downside is no alcohol but definitely not a deal breaker.  Will try again soon!!",

WRONG!  it's ono licious!  lick your fingers. yummy!  It's not the easiest place to find if you're going by strict GPS directions.. once you get really close 500 feet.. you have to use your eyes to find the place.  The only mild negative is that, BECAUSE it's made to order... you have to wait.  We waited 20 minutes, but it was worth it.    The food is hot and fresh, like mom or grandma would have made in their kitchen.  If you like spicy and sweet... with some teriyaki style flavors... this is the place for you!",

Instant seating, ambiance & location would only rate 1 star at most.. but the food makes all the diff and that IS the point of a restaurant.    I had 2 Fusion Tacos, one with chicken and the other with pork.  I had no idea so much filler could fit on those little tacos, but they were both excellent - I especially loved the chicken one.  Hubby got the Bulgogi burrito and I could have sworn I saw little hearts fluttering around him when he bit into that monster.  I'll admit, I was surprised by the amount of damage he did to that, since I think there are countries with less land mass than that thing had.  And yes, I had a taste of it.. definitely a winner.  Oh, and I had made the mistake of ordering the Spam Musubi - not that there was anything wrong with it, just no room left to fit it into my tummy after the tacos.  Once I started on them, the musubi just kinda got forgotten about.. I took it home, though, and had it the next day - still tasty despite being a day old, so I'm betting it would have been fantastic when it was fresh.  We will definitely be back, and soon =D",

The bulgogi burrito, just a normal burrito with korean beef.... again, nothing special. And the bulgogi fries.... just get the nachos instead. All in all, if you're expecting to be punched in the mouth with a whole bunch of \"fusion\" flavor, this is not the place for you. But if you simply want a decent affordable meal, komex is the place.

Don't judge a book by it's cover though, this has to be one of my top favorite family-owned businesses in Las Vegas!   We came on a weekday night, an hour about closing. Apparently this night they were short staffed, and the place was busy, so service took longer than expected (but of course, was understood). I do not eat meat, but thank goodness they had vegetarian options on their menu. I had the fusion tacos sans the meat, but added kimchi. Even without the meat, the lettuce wrap tacos with kimchi were delicious!  My friends ordered the fusion tacos with beef and pork, and everyone at our table was highly please by the taste for such a cheap, cheap price (I believe it was $1.95 for the tacos, where can you get a better deal than that other than at a Taco Bell or Del Taco?!)  While the service was slammed that night, we were able to talk to one of the owners who, while very busy, still showed awesome service to us, even when we had many questions to ask amongst how busy it was. Very nice owner who is willing to explain everything down to the last ingredient. Will definitely return here again, this is my new favorite fusion restaurant! (That ISN'T fast-food!)",

The food was ok, we sampled the bulgogi chimichanga, chicken quesadilla, and pork/spam kimchi fried rice.  Being from Hawaii, I've had my share of pretty awesome Korean food, Mexican not so much.  The fusion of styles actually works quite well, but I won't be going back.  Not because of the food...  ...because of the service...so I walked in for the first time and was given a menu and told they would take my order when I was ready.  I politely chimed in that I was trying the place for the first on a very high recommendation of a friend and asked what they would suggest for my first time.  Apparently they didn't care much that they were recommended as I was abruptly told it was a Mexican restaurant served with Korean meats...yeah, I kind of knew that...then recommended I have what my friend had..Idk what they had, and was pretty turned off at that point...so yeah, long story short, wasn't worth the money paid, but it wasn't horrible...and if you're going to check it out for yourself, definitely look at the menu ahead of time and have an idea of what you want to order before going in.",

There are literally none in WA where I just moved from and they are totally missing out.   I've been to a ton of Korean fusion places in CA where Korean pizza is my favorite thing of all time. I have yet to find that here, but Korean + Mexican sounded amazing too so I made sure to come here as soon as I moved here.   I ordered the Bulgogi flautas which were heaven. The meat was full of flavor, not fatty, and juicy. The outside of the flautas was light, but crispy which made for an overall amazing texture. There are some foods that I just can't stand just do to texture so I'm glad these passed both the flavor and texture test. I love that they sell Mexican coke here too.   The place was clean, the staff were very friendly, the cost was decent, and the wait really wasn't bad considering it's all made fresh when you order.",

The fried rice was heavy on the Kim chee flavor which is fine but it was a little too wet with Kim chee juice. The chimichanga wasn't too bad. Can't go wrong with a fried burrito essentially. The beef bulgogi was disappointing; dry and tough. The flavor also wasn't what I expected it was more sweet than anything. The spicy pork was pretty good but not very spicy and also a bit dry. Service though was awesome! The guy was maybe the owner or manager; he was very nice. Overall I may try this place again maybe it was an off day.",

You'll also find kimchi fried rice, musubi, wonton soup, enchitada, traditional Mexican burritos & tacos, etc.  The restaurant is hidden in a strip mall (approximately 15~20 minutes drive from the Strip) & there's another KoMex Fusion location (intersection of Buffalo & Flamingo), but I intentionally drove here because I wanted to visit the original location.  ***  Complimentary chips: Good guacamole with some diced tomato. Salsa tasted slightly spicy and chips were freshly made (crunchy with a soft texture).   Calamari Taco (flour tortilla with lettuce, pico de gallo, fusion tartar sauces - $3): Pretty good calamari and solid tortilla chip. Salsa was decent, but it could be better. You probably need tot add your own hot sauce to improve the overall flavors.  Beef Kimchi Fried Rice (fried egg on top, 1/2 serving for $8): Good seasoning and I like this dish.  Pork Belly Musubi (marinated rice wrapped in nori aka dried seaweed, 2 pieces for $6): Average pork belly + rice + seaweed = wait did I really pay $6 for this order?  ***  Good cheap eat in Vegas (in fact my dinner on that night was my leftover from KoMex) and my recommendation is to get kimchi fried rice (good portion) & avoid any musubi (not worth what you are paying for).  P.S. - You'll get a fortune cookie at the end of your meal!  P.P.S. - 5% off the bill if you pay with cash!",

I opted for kimchi fried rice with beef (a non-fusion item), and it's a rather generous portion. Not as much beef as I would have liked, but kimchi fried rice usually doesn't have a whole bunch of beef to begin with.  If I came by KoMex again, I would stick with their fusion options as that what makes them stick out (their fusion chimichanga sounds delicious!). The restaurant isn't glam by any means, but it's also quite possibly the most affordable fusion place I've been to, so come with an appetite to chow down.",

Super gigantic portions - familiar Korean favorites (bulgogi) as well as Mexican staples (burritos, tacos, chimichangas) with Korean/Asian ingredients. In particular, the burritos are as big as nuclear bombs. Bonus points for free chips, guacamole, and salsa at your table.  While the portions are large and super tasty, I left feeling super thirsty after trying a bulgogi combo plate with beef and spicy pork. Without further experience here with other menu items, I'd have to attribute this to heavy use of salt, oil, and/or MSG.  The space itself is tiny, with tables for about 25 people max, and service is somewhat rushed because of the tremendous volume they get. Still, a very dependable local option when it comes to portion size, price, and value. Great for feeding small families.",

Not knowing what to expect, considering I've never really been in this particular part of town, we walked in, were greeted by the staff and we were seated right away. Feels like a Mom & Pop shop, love those! Fine dining is for the other word for CAT.  I had a vegetarian taco in a wrapped in lettuce vs. the tortilla. And the hubs had a bunch of other things that I can't remember, let's just say, I wasn't as hungry as he was that night. My taco was UNbelievably flavorful. No, it's not Korean and it's Mexican, it's FUSION, so everyone expecting one or the other, wth is wrong with you? Look it up in the dictionary!  It's a freaking mixture of BOTH, some of you need to quit being angry and just enjoy the dang food because it's GOOD, stop lying.  Staff was friendly. They were on top of drinks and checked up on us often.   Haven't been back purely bc it's a bit too far from where we live, but we will be back, I think I'll have a craving soon...",

    "text": "I had a good experience here when I took my mom to lunch. So this is a sit down place! They emphasize that they are not fast food.   This is fusion Mexican and Korean food. Great concept! This is what I'd consider a whole in the wall.  They brought out complimentary chips with salsa and guac. Small serving but complimentary so not a complaint at all. Just a note.  We shared kimchi fried rice and a bulgogi fusion burrito. The kimchi fried rice was good! We got a full serving for $10 I think? And we added an egg on top which was extra. It was full of kimchi flavor, it was saucy, and the egg on top was delicious. We had it with beef as the meat of choice.  The burrito was kind of small for the price and wasn't anything special. I don't know if I ordered wrong and just got a regular beef burrito but the flavor of bulgogi wasn't present to me. It tasted like they used fresh ingredients but it really lacked in flavor. It wasn't bad but I just was expecting a lot more flavor. There was nothing that made it \"fusion\" except the meat but that didn't really work out for me.   Overall I'd give this place a 3 or 3.5 based off of this experience.   Some suggestions would be to change their service. They don't do the whole server and sit down thing well and would probably benefit to just do a Roberto's type of ordering thing. Otherwise they should have a real service. Like get a host stand would be step one. I don't want to go into detail but I just think this would really help. Or maybe a number system.   Also maybe it was just me but they should marinade their bulgogi more.   The Kim chi fried rice is really good though. They don't shy away from the Kim chi flavor and that's a good thing. My mom hates eating other Asian foods that aren't Thai and she actually raved about this. The fried rice was the saving grace.   The young woman working was nice and I'd totally go back to try other things and give them another chance.",

Perhaps it was a off night for KoMex, because Lynda had the night off, and the wait staff seemed to be in a slight rush mode to get home.    I have to admit, we got to KoMex at 8:15 pm, but we were out of there before 8:50 pm.      As far as our dishes, my enchilada was good, and didn't have too much sauce on it, but as far as that, it was solid.    My friend was kind of disappointed with his chimichanga, because it wasn't fried enough.   I had a feeling his dishes wasn't ready,  because he got his plate a couple of minutes before mine.     I'm only going to mark a star off  for this visit, because I never recognize any of the workers on this shift, but they need to step up to the plate if the owners of one my favorite restaurants have the night off.",

If the oil is hot enough, the food absorbs much less of it.  Thus, though the bulgogi in the chimichanga was perfect, the chimichanga itself was very greasy.   Don't get me wrong.. I'm being meticulous here :)   I'd like to see Komex begin to incorporate gluten-free tortillas (I realize corn tortillas are generally an option -- But for the deep fried chimichanga, I'm not sure if it is -- I would imagine so.. but not certain).  Nonetheless, you'll enjoy Komex!",

Here's what I got for less than $7: ---  Complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole(!) ---  Two fusion tacos - one beef and one pork.  Both with kimchi and their super hot sauce.  These had so much stuff on them that I had to eat them with a knife and fork.  I know, bad form on my part.   ---  One fish taco ---  A complimentary dessert - a sectioned orange with a toothpick.  Cute! ---  One can of Diet Coke  A portly (stout?) (rotund?) (pleasantly plump?) lady was sitting near me.  She ordered FOUR TACOS, stuffed her napkin down her shirt, picked up a taco, and WENT TO TOWN!!!  Sauce was running down both her arms and she was dropping some serious food.  It was a sight to behold.    One of my friends (a fat guy) once told me, \"If you're a fat guy, the food never hits the ground first.\"   But I digress.  They need to charge more!  I told the Asian lady (the owner?) this when she brought my bill.  The space is small and it's out of the way for tourists like me.  But WOW, the food is OUTSTANDING!",

I recommend to order a variety of dishes and do family style on your first visit so that way you can taste a little bit of all the tasty goodness....I could have just eaten the free chips salsa and guacamole all day....its not your regular chips but I wont give it away...just go and try it!

The tacos were ok, but to be honest nothing spectacular. The nachos stole the show for me, and I enjoyed every aspect of them. They have the perfect combination of spicy, sweet, and crunchy. I will say that I bet a lot of people would want them spicier, but they were perfect for me.  The one drawback seems to be their drink selection. I think that they should invest in a soda delivery system - this would make me raise my review by a star for sure.",

    "text": "this must be what peer pressure feels like without actually having the pressure directly upon you. i feel like i HAVE TO write a good review of this place just because everyone else has. i'm so afraid that i may get slammed by the komex police or something!  i had heard about this place from many fellow yelpers and read all the glowing reviews and so decided to give it a go. i knew, full well, that i was going in with expectations through the roof. unfortunately, what i expected and what i actually received were 2 entirely different things. i definitely feel that my opinion is a little skewed by my anticipation of having a mind blowing experience. therefore, i will give it 4 stars on the basis that my experience would have been significantly better had i not walked in expecting myself to find the meaning of life in one of these tacos.  on my first visit, i had the tofu fusion taco, the stir fried fettucine and the spicy seafood stir fry. the hubby had the bulgogi taco sampler and the bulgogi french fries. on my second visit, i had the tofu enchilada platter and the hubby had the same bulgogi tacos.  the tacos were, without a doubt, outstandingly tasty. it amazes me that tofu can actually deliver so much flavor but, somehow, the folks at komex have figured it out. the enchilada i had was on the same level as the tacos. really tasty for having no meat substance of any kind involved. i absolutely love the complimentary chips, salsa and guac. i could eat bags of those. the bulgogi fries are heart attack inducing goodness.  as for the rest of the food, i'd have to say they were pedestrian at best. i'm not a fan of the stir fry fettucine. if i'm gonna have asian style noodles, i'd like them to be cooked with asian noodles. the spicy seafood stir fry seemed to be made with the bag of frozen seafood you find at any asian supermarket - chewy and flavorless. definitely something anyone can make at home.  BUT...the tacos and essentially everything on the left side of the menu were totally worth going back for again. we even brought some friends from out of town to give them a try and they loved their tacos. so, i'll definitely continue to dine here if i'm in that neck of the woods but i'll be sure to stick to the left half of the menu.",

Korean BBQ and Mexican is one oof the most beautiful marriages in all of culinary history and this place makes the union shine. I nearly wept with happiness at the yumminess of each bite.  There's not much else to say except that this place makes Mexican food (which was good to begin with) new, exciting, and even better than before.

Now just to be fair, I did not try many items on the menu, but the Fusion tacos were amazing! I am Mexican and these tacos are, in my opinion, better than any you can buy at a regular Mexican Restaurant! Yes, the location is not attractive at all but who cares if the food is soo good.   Please note, the place will be closed  from Dec 15- December 26th for the holidays:(   So here is my final analysis:   Pro:  1)Asked for water and instead of getting tap water, we got to free bottled water.  2) Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole, all free!  3) Checked in on yelp and got an order of Wontons.  4) The tacos we very good. Meat was juicy and soft.  5) VERY Cheap!  Our bill came out to 8 dollars!  6) Fortunate cookie and orange.  7) Very good variety of food.   Cons:  1) I feel like I stole some food because it was that cheap!  2) Might take a bit if you go during lunch hours.",

I also didn't like that their Korean wings tasted like soap they were so hot out the grease what ever sauce they put on them couldn't be found by my taste buds!! I did enjoy the different ways they used bulgogi in burritos. I'd return only for the basic bulgogi and rice!!",

The kimchi fried rice was not good. I make it all the time at home and the one at KoMex was too sweet. The portions are very large, so we took the leftovers home and doctored it up with some sriracha to tame the sweetness.   It's a small place in a little strip mall.

This is another reason why I love coming to family own businesses they always seem to know how to take care of their customers.   Food here is decent in price with an awesome taste that will knock your shoes off. I'm a sucker for yummy food that has kimchi in it and guess what this place decided to do? Yeah some genius here thought it'd be a good idea to put kimchi in their fried rice and WOW was it awesome. Kimchi fried rice with some of that nicely tasting marinated meat all bunched up in the fried rice.....I hate for those of you guys that can only imagine this tasty food and can't have a chance to eat it. If you're definitely in the area, I really really suggest you come to this spot and try it out, if you like Korean food, then this place is a must. They also have some Mexican food as well, but if you come here I suggest you try the fusion side of the menu. You simply can't go wrong with KO-rean food fused with MEX-ican food. KOMEX you guys rock. Having friendly staff as well, makes this place that much better. I really wish they would have a place like this is the Bay Area instead of those cheap imitations.  On top of the fried rice, we also ordered the bul go gi burrito, I believe that was what it was called. It was just like the fried rice, but all wrapped up in a burrito. Another thing that was good here was their fried wonton, which were pretty much ground beef wrapped into a wonton (this item is free if you check in from yelp). I almost forgot that we also ordered the bul go gi fries. Just as the others were good, the fries were just as good. All these things were too good to be True and I highly recommend any one of these.  When coming here please beware, that your tastebuds will go nuts after eating here, making you want to come back for more. It just sucks that I live 9 hours from this place and I can only get it when I'm in Vegas.  I WILLLLLL BE BACK FOR MORE KOMEX!",

    "text": "Located a few miles off the strip, but toOOOOOootally worth it.  The concept here should be nothing new to anyone that doesn't live under a rock: Mexican-Korean fusion food... Think Kogi Truck, but in my opinion it's better: You don't have to track Komex down via twitter/fb, and there's no 1 hour+ outdoor wait for a food truck parked in a random lot. Best of all, there's a place to sit & enjoy the fantastic food right away, as it is being served to you by the friendly owners.  We ordered:  - WonTons: Free via Yelp check-in, and they were yummy yeah, aw yeaaaah. - 2 pan fried bulgogi (Korean beef) tacos - The special of the week. If you ever get this one, make sure you devour it while the taco shell is still hot & crunchy. - Fusion chicken tacos: Fabulous chunks of grilled juicy chicken meat - Fusion spicy pork burrito: The gf & I split this. Don't be intimidated by \"spicy\" pork - as with most Korean-style spicy pork, it's only mildly spicy if anything. For those that aren't too fond of kimchi, you can ask them to leave it out. But really, this burrito was originally designed to be eaten with the fresh kimchi cabbage to enhance the overall fusion experience. - Bulgogi Fries: Think carne asada fries but with the bulgogi (slightly sweet marinated Korean beef) instead. This thing was massive.. since the 4 of us had wontons, chips, and like 3 tacos and half a burrito each, we weren't even able to finish these delicious fries.  - Free Chips & Guacamole/Salsa - The freshly fried homemade chips  were so awesome that we had to ask for more. I also couldn't believe that these free chips also came with guacamole. There was the traditional Mexican salsa, traditional Korean red pepper paste (a kinda sweet gochujang), and the group's favorite salsa which was sriracha (red rooster sauce) based mixed with some chili oil. We loved this sauce in particular so much that we asked for another cup of it.  The setting here closely resembles any other typical taqueria (their logo is a big cartoon dude wearing a huge sombrero) but offers much, MUCH more.  Thanks broham for finding another place to visit every single time we come to Vegas!  Cliff Notes: BOMB fusion burritos/tacos/fries/nachos with Korean-style meats & ingredients.",

This was my first time getting the Chow Fettuccine, it was delicious!   We spent like $17.  The place was busy (it usually is).  We were lucky and got seated right away, but the wait for the food was pretty long.  We finished off the first basket of chips and salsa and guacamole. So they brought us a second basket, but I think they noticed with enjoy the guacamole, because they gave us to little cups of guacamole instead of just one.   There was a couple next to us and the girl was there for the first time. It was very funny because she ordered fried rice, wings, some shrimp dish, and one other item I can't remember. Anyways each time they brought a dish she was shocked at the size.  She couldn't believe the portion sizes. Then when she was try the dish she was shocked again at how delicious they all were! I was very entertaining to watch her enjoy the experience for the first time.  Still great food, great staff, and good times! We posted pictures on our instagram and all our friends and family want to try it when they are in town.",

I had 3 Fusion tacos (pork, chicken and beef) ala carte. I ordered 2 with a lettuce wrap and one with corn tortillas. And at $1.25 apiece that was a bonus. I really liked all 3 of them and the combination (fusion) of Korean with Mexican was awesome. Korean flavored beef tacos with cilantro and Korean Hoisin type hot sauce was just over the top. My wife had the Bulgogi Fusion Burrito (and it was enough to feed 3 of us). My boy had the Boneless Kalbi plate, and my girl had the taquito plate.   So not only can you order good Fusion food but they have a pretty good selection of Mexican food and Asian food also.   I'm going to try the Mexican Chow Mein next time. That one sounds interesting.   A place has gotta be good when I have to drive out of my comfy confines of Summerlin to try a place in a questionable area of town. Decor is urban (looks like a converted laundromat) but who cares! The food is definitely worth the trip and I'll be back.",

Throw it down with the killer Bulgogi Fries, which is a mother-load of marinated bbq, salsa and cheese on top of a bed of fries.  Be sure to try out all the sauces on their sauce caddy.  The mix of korean and mexican salsa makes a great addition to such classy grub! Kimchi I'm out!  ...oh but don't forget, location is a lil' north townish, so lock yo doors!",

    "text": "Writing a review for Komex Express is unlike most any review I've ever written. Generally I will post my critique of an establishment on Yelp after only one or two visits, but Komex is a different kind of place that deserved a different approach.     Komex was opened for quite a while before I ventured in for the first time. The location that Komex occupies is where one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, El Burrito Cafe, once stood. This spot is only a few hundred yards from my house so the Komex signs were merely reminders of a food spot that I had literally grown up with here in Vegas. Could this \"fusion\" restaurant compare to the family run Mexican joint I had been so fond of? No way!! Well, maybe I was wrong this time. Komex is beyond incredible!! After stumbling across a bunch of positive reviews on Yelp I decided to go check this place out and there has been no turning back!!    If you haven't tried Korean/ Mexican fusion you don't know what you're missing. The melding of spices and peppers that are used in each type of food has been mastered by the Yi family. Most items on the menu at Komex (tacos, burritos, etc.) are available with carne, pollo and carnitas and each is equally delicious. The tacos and burritos are all insanely delicious, but the tortas are by far my favorite. They are made with an ample amount of meat (I prefer the carne on these), lettuce, tomato, avocado and jalapeno on a fresh, soft roll. The bulgogi is also a can't miss option if you want to delve further into the Korea side of the menu. I've had the bulgogi as both a burrito (try it with a little Kimchi) and on its own. Both were awesome! Yesterday I decided to try to fusion cheese enchiladas which I was sure would be at least a slight step down from the other fare at Komex, but guess what; DELICIOUS!! BTW, did I mention the prices??!! The food at Komex would be a bargain at twice the price in my eyes. Taste and quality vs. cost puts Komex at the top of any list of restaurants in Vegas for sure. Be sure to try the unsweetened jasmine tea too.    I would also be remiss if I didn't mention how great the service is. The staff is always very friendly and the service is prompt. Linda is the smiling face that greets every customer that walks in and she sees to it that each patron is well taken care of. I continually tell all my friends that if you aren't making the short trip to Komex, you're missing out on a real treat. Komex definitely on my short list of regular stops for great food!!",

    "text": "Sounds weird, tastes awesome. They basically serve Mexican dishes with Korean bulgogi instead of traditional mexican carne asada and the like. They add Korean hot sauce and kimchi to some things as well. The twisted guacamole was some of the best I've ever had. I tried almost everything my first time, the rolled tacos were to die for, as was the weird tater tot bowl thing whose name I don't remember. Go here now.",

Korean family style cooking (plates of great food brought to your table) Fusion Mexican entree's that combine great ingredients and flavors to provide spicy tasty Taco's, Burrito's and salsa's.  They have renovated the location, removing the space limiting booths and now boast more places to sit and eat this awesome food. My only issue, they don't do a BiBimBap... Owner says, \"everybody does that.\"  I wish... :-) Because they are close and I know theirs would be great. :-)",

    "text": "The owners, Linda and Sonny, are very nice. I have tried coming to this place so many times after work, but I always get there right around when they're closing. But closing time is also when you know whether the restaurant is legit or not because if the food is good at that hour, you know the chef cares and is not there hoping just to go home. Even when they're locking or have already locked their doors, they will open their doors for me.  This is what I have experienced with Komex Fusion Express. The flags expressing \"Chinese Food\" by the sidewalk next to their driveway is a magnanimous understatement of their capabilities. Their offerings are much more, although I'm sure a crowd is drawn to Chinese and other Asian cuisines.  If you haven't noticed yet, I only rate 4 or 5 star places, which is why I don't have too many reviews. Not too many things fall on my radar and I do not believe in ruining businesses. Now, to the food, which is what this is all about.  This isn't fast food. Please do not be in a rush when coming here, although they do try to appease fast foodies with their own fried tortilla chips and in-house made salsa.  Bulgogi Tacos: Small tortillas, which show they know the True size of tasty tacos, wrap around some awesome beef with pepper, salt, and some fresh cilantro with a wedge of lime to squeeze on the side. Kimchi should be requested. It's really delicious with the taco, and I'm not reminiscing about Kogi either. The price point is absolutely so low that you know they just want you to share the love of food with them and others.  Won Ton Soup: Fresh thin won ton wrappers embrace tender beef in a broth that was made obviously with care and not monosodium glutamate. This pleased my palate in temperature, texture, and taste. A whole egg was swirled in like in egg drop soup. Freshness is worth waiting for.  Fried Won Ton: The same delicious won ton, battered and deep fried. Frying anything tastes better, but frying something delicious tastes phenomenal.  Bulgogi Fried Rice: I am an ultimate rice monger. I absolutely love rice. When I first saw the fried rice come out, the density of the brown color on the rice made me actually weary, but to my surprise, the rice must have been made with a sweet soy or a mushroom soy because it wasn't too salty, and the tastiness of the pepper, the eggs, the temperature and wok chi of the rice was a perfect blend, lending itself to be one of the best fried rices I have ever had in my 26 years of ricing.  Sauces: Three sauces came out with the Bulgogi Fried Rice. There's a regular chili sauce, a Chinese chili sauce which has fresh cilantro, Sambal Oelek and some other peppers mixed in, and then there's the Mexican chili sauce, which I did not try, but I will be back for.",

    "text": "Yelp hot spot for sure that actually lived up to it's expectations. The atmosphere is definitely not the best considering the location is in a run down shopping center. Oh well, it's all about the food right? Although on the plus side they did change the tables and chairs since my first visit which was last year. My first time here I tried the fusion burrito with chicken, pretty delicious I must say and wayy cheap too about $5ish. A little on the spicy side, but most chicken dishes that are Mexican are typically spicy to begin with. Most people like the heat, but for me I definitely drank all my water before finishing the burrito. My second time I came in a huge group with 20+ during lunch on a Sunday. Fortunately they had an area that was reserved, I don't know who it was for, but they obviously had to seat us there since there was no where else. The service was really good considering how big our group was and they accommodated all of us having separate checks. I had the bolgogi fries, which I had high hopes for and it was good but was missing the \"fresh factor.\"  I don't think I would order this again and stick the basics next time I come.",

I read a lot of the Yelp reviews and decided that the good completely out weighed the bad. My boyfriend and I ordered so much that we actually had the lady, whom I think was the owner and was super nice, actually stop us mid-order just to tell us that this was a lot of food. LOL! She was soooooooo right. We ended up taking a lot of it home with us. They first came out with chips (homemade and awesome) with salsa and guac. Then they brought out our spam musubis WITH FRIED EGG :9 Then, came out our humongous burritos. Bulgogi (beef) for my bf and Duk-gogi (chicken) for me. The fusion between korean and mexican flavors was something I've never experienced before. It was genius. It had rice, our choice of meat, pico de gallo, beans and cilantro. Then came our tacos. I had pork, my bf had chicken and fish, which was fried and hardly any breading at all (such a breath of fresh air). I ate one taco and just a third of my burrito. Again, it was HUMONGOUS. So that was two burritos, four tacos, two spam musubis, a Voss water bottle, and lemonade for just $25!!! Can't beat that! And we used our check-in prize of fried wantons (also delicious!!)  Definitely going to hit this spot up again! :D",

The location is not in a very good part of town, which probably explains why KoMex is only open until 8pm.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall spot. Definitely order the FUSION burrito. I personally like the daeji-kogi (daeji= pig) with the kimchi also inside the burrito. Everything is fresh and the free chips/guac/sauce they give you are a perfect precursor to the giant burritos.  For two people to leave completely stuffed our total bill was $10 and change! We ended up leaving them $16 just because we felt guilty that it was so cheap.  Definitely try KoMex! :)",

Came here the other night about 30 minutes until closing so I was a bit nervous about how we'd be treated and the quality of the food. Once we arrived,  however, we were welcomed with all smiles and my worries were gone. The service was awesome. Our orders were taken and brought out in promptly fashion.   We ordered two plates of Kimchi Fried Rice (spam and beef bulgogi) and being a such a sucker for kimchi anything, I loved both. I prefer a little more of a spice factor, but it was still delicious. I also had the Fushion Tacos; one beef bulgogi and one pork belly, which were also quite tasty. The meats were well-seasoned (not too sweet or salty) and cooked to perfection. They were also very generous in filling the tacos. Whoop! Regardless of being close to closing time, all of our dishes were made fresh, which definitely made our experience with the food so enjoyable. I'd recommend any of their fusion items and most definitely the kimchi fried rice! Yumm.  If you're in the area and looking for tasty Korean-Mexican fusion with good service, check this place out!",

Take that love and throw in a blend of Korean and Mexican style cooking, and you've got yourself a winner! I love this place! Each bite I took was an explosion of deliciousness that had the right amount of spice and a perfect balance between Korean and Mexican flavor.  I think my absolute favorite dish are the kimchee fried rice. I went with my family and we ordered two plates: one with spam and and one with beef bulgogi. They were both equally good and despite having our own entrees, we cleaned up the fried rice because it was just irresistible. It's as good as any of the best kimchee fried rice you'd have at, thrown in with meats that were cooked to a savory excellence. The fried rice was definitely more Korean so you won't find much Mexican fused into this dish.  For my own entrees I split fusion tacos with my cousin. We had beef bulgogi (duh) and pork belly. These were definitely a split balance between Korean and Mexican style. I couldn't decide which one I liked better but I certainly recommend going with the fusion tacos because you have a lot of choices depending on what kind of meats you like.  I felt really bad because we showed up at 7:30 (they close at 8) and I was worried we might encounter some annoyance with showing up so late, but we got none of that. I really appreciate them being very welcoming, not showing any annoyance with us and still delivering quality food. Can't wait to come back here!",

I think the spicy pork is pretty good here, and the bulgoigi was just 'ok.'  Bulgoigi Tacos $2 -above average-The bulgoigi tacos were pretty good.  They came out within 5 minutes of our order. Spicy Pork tacos-$2- above average-Same as above.  Bulgoigi fried rice $9-slightly above average-Pretty good.  I wished they gave a little more bulgoigi though.  Had some trouble tasting it.  I think it might be ok to pass on this if you aren't in the mood for fried rice.  Bulgoigi & Spicy Pork-slightly above average-The portions on this dish are massive!  Big enough for 2 people to share.  My only gripe was the bulgoigi was a bit over-cooked.  I enjoyed the spicy pork.  Tips: -Complimentary chips w/ your order -Where's my kimchii at??!?!

Being from California, we are obsessed with Mexican. We were intrigued by the fusion of foods they had to offer. We only order the half fusion nachos/half fusion fries plate, but they did not disappoint! The flavors were unlike anything we have ever had! The chips were similar to wontons and the beef had a delicious sweet sauce that it had been cooked in!! That mixed with the cheese, sauce and fried goodness led us to leaving full and happy from one $8 plate! This is a great place to try if you want something new and exciting!",

    "text": "I came here after seeing Komex on multiple lists for foods to try in Vegas.  I don't see what the big deal is...  I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!  Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.    To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.  Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.  Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.  But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entree failed to pass my taste test.  My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK....  As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae...",

    "text": "Almost six months had passed since I last reviewed this fine little restaurant, and it was time for a return.  I found it to be just as accommodating as before, offering free bottled water and complimentary homemade tortilla chips with a spicy guacamole dip.  I was even supplied with extra guacamole at no charge when the first quantity ran out.  This time I wanted to try new items.  So, I had a half-order of Wonton Soup and a full order of Mark's Favorite Chow Fettuccine.  The Wonton Soup was a simple but delicious bowl of Cantonese goodness.  It contained 4 doughy wontons filled with ground beef and pork, 1 button mushroom, some onions, and a touch of whisked egg floating in a very hot, very tasty broth.  A full order costs only $1.00 more, and contains 8 wontons!    My main dish could easily have filled two diners, and it was probably folly for me to eat the whole thing in one sitting.  About two-thirds of the way through, I was asked if I wanted a to-go box--as if that was the normal regimen for a single diner--but foolishly declined and forged ahead until I was thoroughly stuffed.  And, my bathroom scale made me pay for that extravagance the next day.  The food itself consisted of a generous amount of hunks of tender chicken, pieces of lean beef, and medium-sized nicely stir-fried shrimps mixed with green and purple cabbage, red and white onion strands, green and red bell pepper slices, some carrot splinters, and oodles of fettucinne nicely mixed together with a very light brown sauce.  The dish just needed a little salt, which slight application of soy sauce quickly provided.  It was a fine platter of multi-flavored and textured treats.  Complimentary orange slices and a fortune cookie were brought to the table at meal's end for a refreshing finish to a very substantial lunch.   I did notice one thing different from my two previous visits.  Instead of several casually clad 20-something males predominantly in attendance, this time the nearly completely full small dining room featured a wide mix of diners, including snowy-haired senior couples, young men in suits, a technician in surgical scrubs, the middle aged, and a young couple.  The demographics have shifted to a wider audience as the kudos keep coming in for this no longer obscure, cook-to-order gem.",

However, my last update doesn't reflect how my current opinion, so I needed to correct my rating. Suffice to say, it was more than a little disappointing.  I went with a friend over an extended lunch. It was his first time, and he was pretty impressed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way. Looking back on my at-the-time basic photos, I had some bulgogi fries and a chimichanga, most likely pork given my tendencies to vary the protein. There weren't any salt or cooking issues, but the levels and layers of flavor just didn't appeal to me very much that day.  I did greatly appreciate the sweet, fresh orange provided for dessert and the complimentary chips and salsa presented as an appetizer, but nothing has motivated me to make the trip from Henderson. I'd recommend sticking to more flavorful Mexican tacos or waiting to try the Korean-Mexican fusion concept elsewhere.",

KoMex is a fantastic little hole in the wall that is probably most well known to locals and also out of town foodies like me and my cousin.   The inside is clean, well lit and full of the mom and pop/hole in the wall vibe. The server is also the host/cashier/everything but a cook so please be patient. We ordered:  - Beef Bulgogi tacos: Wow, just wow. Perfectly cooked and seasoned beef neatly tucked in a corn tortilla. What took it to the next level was that the lettuce/tomatoes were marinated in a special type of vinaigrette that was part savory and citrusy at the same time. I've never tasted that type of flavor before in a taco but man was it phenomenal.   - Kimchi fried rice with spam: Another fav. When I order this at Korean places, it can get super greasy but Komex got this shit down right. Right amount of spice, seasoning and spam to keep me shoveling in the rice spoonful after spoonful.  - Chow Fettucine with veggies: Loved this dish. It was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of soy and the veggies had a slight crisp. I would order this again but with beef and also a full order!  Definitely  coming back here the next time I am in town. Totally worth venturing off the strip for some good quality local grub!",

Wish they made their own tortillas but almost no does in the States. But you get a ton of food on one taco.  Oh yeah, take a look at the pic I took. Its unique, I was amazed that no one else has taken this pic and posted it. It's not food, it's the sign about KoMex not being fast food. Seriously, this sign says it all.

Not the most ambient of places (what do u expect from a taco shop) but very reasonable prices, friendly service, and just delicious food. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Their fushion (Korean-style) tacos and burritos are one of kind. And make sure you get kimchi added to your tacos or burritos for the extra zesty flavor.",

Komex is located in a strip mall and is a bit of a hole in the wall with paper napkin drawings taped to the wall and a dark, dirty water? line that made its way along the wall, counter, buckets, etc. The floor is chipped and dated as is much of the remaining decor.  But hey, I came here for the food right? We ordered a few beef bulgogi tacos, a few pork bulgogi tacos, the half order of loaded fries, and a chimichanga to split for two. We received complimentary chips with guac and salsa. Chips were oily and needed salt, guac was quite bland, and salsa not memorable. The tacos were the highlight of the meal albeit a bit messy. Fries were super soggy and execution of the dish was straight up poor. The chimichanga was equally as meh that we left half of it untouched. Of the beef, pork, and chicken bulgogi meats we tried, chicken was the worst.  Good for a cheap eat that is not Chipotle or Taco Bell, but not worthy of the accolades it has received. Cash money = 5% off.",

    "text": "Korean Mexican fusion- This is certainly in my top five of Las Vegas. There are two locations I'm pleased to let you know! Decatur, just north of the the 95, across from Ford, and Jack in the Box, nestled in a quiet strip mall. The other location is on buffalo just south of flamingo - also in the corner. :)  This may actually be my favorite spot in Vegas considering big locations. I really enjoy the beef chow fettuccine. I've ordered it, literally every time.  Every time, I'm greeted with a perfect portion of chips and salsa.  Very personable environment, usually pleasantly calm. Perfect for date night, or family night out.  Both locations have the same vibe. A mix mash of bamboo wall screened windows, and a tv usually in the background. The Buffalo location usually has holiday lights :)",

    "text": "Came here with a couple of friends eager to eat some Korean Mexican fusion reminiscent of Roy choy's kogi truck.  If you dine in, they give you free chips and salsa. Love that!! They also refill it for you too when you're done.   We ordered the bulgogi tatter tots, the bulgogi rice bowl, kimchi fried rice and the chimichanga. I must say that the portions here are very generous!  We ordered the half portion of the kimchi fried rice but was unable to finish it and I had tons of it for left overs. My favorite I think was the fried rice. I love the tart and spicy flavor of the kimchi in combination with spam. The chimichanga was good but I thought the tortillas was too thick and took away form the flavor. The bulgogi tatter tots looks amazing and it did taste great but I felt there could have been more kimchi and gochugang flavor. The tots were crispy and the bulgogi was sweet but I wanted a little more spicy and tart flavors in the mix. The bulgogi rice was good but not super impressive. If that's what your craving for then go for it but it's not the most adventurous item of the menu.   The owners here are really nice and friendly and he service is wonderful. I thought overall he food was delicious and will come back again!",

My initial impression from the yelp photos was that it was more fast-food, but no you sit down, and order from the menu. Food is made as soon as you order. This place doesn't try to be fancy - they're all about solid flavors and creating dishes that will surely satisfy your Asian-Mexican cravings. I had their fusion tacos, which I thought were bomb. The kimchi fried rice was a close second - you can order 1/2 to full plate of this - we went with the whole plate and still had plenty of leftovers for later. The rice had a good spice to hit, good ratios of meat, and kimchi, all stir fried to perfection. Yum! I got a bulgogi plate because I just wanted something more simple, and I really liked the way they did their bulgolgi because it didn't taste too greasy, but still had a good flavor to it. Basically it's just literally a meat plate, so don't expect like veggies or sides to it. Overall the people running this establishment are very hardworking, service was great, and straightforward (notice the signs galore). Would definitely consider making the drive back again.",

    "text": "TLDR: Great fusion-style food; limited healthful choices; no lunch specials; 5% off when paying via cash; complimentary chips and salsa with order  I think KoMex is one of those original restaurants that continued to thrive when the rest faded away. I waited to write my review after trying various items on the menu.   Korean-inspired dishes are pretty tasty and are pretty greasy. Kimchi fried rice has an overpowering kimchi flavor, but the kimchi as an accompaniment is welcome in the other rice dishes. Opt for the bulgogi nachos or bulgogi rice bowl if you're looking for something tasty. I like the rice bowl because it comes with a vinegar-based cold slaw, mixed greens, warm rice, kimchi, and protein of choice all under a sunny-side up egg. The flavors and temperature variation mesh well to provide a well-balanced meal.   While there are no lunch specials, the prices are average and won't break the bank, especially if you pay with cash to receive the discount. While this isn't my favorite location, I'm always happy to come here for a bite to eat.",

I found it because of a Yelp review I read, and it did not disappoint. It looks a little shady on the outside, but looks can be deceiving. The food is wonderful, and the staff is friendly and kind. And it's so inexpensive!!! My husband and I would both eat a delicious dinner, and the bill would be 9 dollars for the two of us! You can't beat that anywhere in Vegas! The tacos are phenomenal, the chips are fresh, and the burritos and nachos are so good! Since we've moved back to the Midwest, I miss that place so much!

    "text": "I right this as I scarf down the remaining portion of my chicken bulgogi fusion chimichanga, so forgive me if I get side tracked.  There is not much more to say other than what all the reviews rave about.  So for the sake of time and the purpose of being original, I will try to talk about other things that I enjoy about my experience.  It has been nearly a year since I returned from my first visit.  Its not that it wasn't good.  I guess that I was over the Korean-Mexican fusion having gotten my fill in Seattle, LA, Hawaii and let's not forget...home sweet home.  That's right I said it, as much as I eat out, me and the old lady can get pretty cray in the kitchen, no not like that...  Last time I mashed on a bulgogi burrito, it was all around good....cheap, huge, tasty, but nothing special.  It's hard to find good bulgogi and there are so many versions and styles in Korean cuisine, just take a look at the millions of kim chee out there.  So when I grind bulgogi, I like to factor in the seasoning as well as the cut of beef (sirloin, ribeye, etc.).  The bulgogi here is good but not great, for my preference.  It tastes more pan cooked versus grilled.  Again, this could be different for others and I know that if I educate myself more on Korean food, I may have an expanded perspective on it.  This time I went with the chicken bulgogi chimichanga.  No regrets whatsoever!  Again, it was cheap, huge and tasty...but this time, I got a better experience.  Perhaps its because I have tried bulgogi burritos many times, but this is definitely a first on the Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay (R.I.P. ODB).  That is what my tongue screams with each bite lol.  It amazes me how they could even fit all the fillings in the plate sized changa!  Gotta get the house sauce too...fresh and flavorful!  It took me two sittings to kill this bad boy...the second commencing as we speak.    If yall don't know changas are fried compared to a burrito, so if this sucka was fried after being filled, nice job.  The dish was not greasy nor were the insides over cooked or tasted fried in any way.  Most Korean dishes, or Oriental dishes for that matter (Notice i refrained from saying Asian on purpose...there is a difference), or pretty lean and on the healthy side.  This is a miraculous piece of work combining what you would think is normally bad for you...into something that is not only more on the healthy side, but delish!  Although, I can't say that slamming over a pound of anything is healthy.    I only wish that Kalbi was an option in each of the dishes, unless it is and I am just not up on my Komex game.  Last I seen, it was available as specials only.  Well the hype is there...more so because Komex has got the game on lock and monopolized in LV, IMO.  Wonder if this would be the case if competitors came through...that may alleviate the double parking and constantly packed dining room, all for good reason though.",

The contest: $10 for all you can eat tacos (your choice of meat and sides) and free soda, iced tea or water for 15 minutes. The challengers: Eric R., Tiffanie R., Gabe, Jen S., and Danny.  The first four did the challenge at the same time, and Danny upon entering battled in round 2. It was a meaty, fast-paced chewdown with flavors flying and lots of excitement.  Jen and Eric were neck-and-neck when it got to tacos 9-11, but Eric's one extra bite claimed initial victory.  Enter Danny, who inhaled 8 tacos in 7 minutes, with all looking good, but he hit a wall, and after 9, Eric R. was declared the winner.  The prize: a KoMex t-shirt and a picture with a sign that read, \"I ate 11 tacos and one bite!\" Tiffanie got recognized for being the only woman brave enough to try the challenge. Otherwise, for us sane people: Lily, Jieun L., Anthony M., Tony T., and Paolo D. - oh, and me! - we ordered from the menu.  I missed out on the free check-in wontons because they have pork, but we were given 4 plates of them generously!  We also got chips, salsa, guac and 4 hot sauces.  There was one I really liked with onions and Korean spices and other herbs. Everyone seemed to go for the lettuce wrap tacos except Paolo who ate his Torta Ahogada in record time and licked that plate clean! I got one beef fusion taco with avocado and jalepeno, and one fusion tostada, the star of the show...a rice patty (perfection!) topped with chicken, lettuce, pico, Korean hot sauce, avocado and jalepeno.  It was so amazing I wanted another one but refrained from overstuffing myself!  I think I am now hooked and next time I am over here, it is 2 rice patty tostadas for me! I also enjoyed the delicious mango-passionfruit iced tea.  I also noticed in the cold case KoMex carries Sweet Leaf mint and honey iced tea, the only sweet-ish tea I will drink (and it is made in AUSTIN!) Soooo much fun and I really liked everything I tasted.  Thank goodness Jen S.  hosted this fabulous event so we could finally eat here.  We also ran into Clint B. here who was here with his family for dinner! In this battle of man versus tacos, Eric R. won!",

I had a bite of those and they were great. The whole family is waiting to go back and we will. Service was great. Never waited long for anything. We didn't go to Decatur we went to the one on buffalo. Couldn't find it so I wrote this down anyway.",

I arrived just before the place became busy. I was hoping to have a great eating experience, as the reviews I read, indicated others had enjoyed the food and service.  I ordered the (1/2 Order) of Bulgogi fries which was about $6.00 and a Diet Pepsi (which was bottled and cost $2.00)  The bulgogi fries tasted old and luke warm.  The meat, cheese and jalapenos were tasty but were also dry and by the time I finished them, were  cold and stuck together.  I was disappointed as I had driven quite a ways to eat there and it really wasn't worth the drive.  I ordered a burrito to go ($7.00) and it had it latter that day at home and it was only average.  I do not have the great experience that other reviewers seemed to have, nor did I find the food to be the \"bomb\" as  others rated the food to be.   The people running the place were friendly and I was happy with the service, but I came for the food and I will have to think if I want to go and try this place again.",

Gets crowded and the wait is long so come at a weird time like 3-5 p.m.  For your first times you will order only from the fusion menu. Then you can live life without regrets. The fusion fries and fusion nachos with bulgogi beef are more than enough for one, share. 3 tacos are enough for one person. All the tacos are perfect. Choose freely. Try something different each visit, but try nachos, fries and tacos first.  Complementary items here are a generous surprise. Homemade chips with salsa AND guacamole.  Dessert oranges.  No tap water here. That's very considerate. I personally enjoy the iced tea.  This is a family business so come often and tip well. You should be anyway because this is a fine restaurant.",

We ordered 9 tacos 2 orders of won tons a basket of fries, and a couple drinks.  Our bill was only $16!  This place is incredible!  Street tacos with kimchi on them.

I understand when business starts picking up, you have to hire more servers and such but there are just some things you can't teach a person like customer service. Living in Vegas, and working in the hospitality industry, you basically live off tips, and you get more tips if the product you provide is great, and the customer service is even better.  Walked-in and got seated immediately with no greeting whatsoever. Waited about 5 minutes to actually get our menus and a few minutes after that for our waters. They were steady busy but nothing crazy like 2 servers couldn't handle about 10-15 guests. It seemed like this new lady server only dropped off the menus and water without giving us a notice that she would be with us, only if it was a convenience for her. She comes, takes our orders, and I tried to ask questions and it seemed like every time I had a question she would get mad because I was taking up her time or something. Seriously? Ordered a few tacos and that's it, 20 minutes later, she drops it off and leaves without asking if we needed anything else. I had to walk up to the counter and ask the lady at the counter for some condiments. Mehh  Not a fan of their new staff but their food is still good. It's not anything like KOGI from LA, but I give them credit for bringing something new into Vegas cuisine.",

The bulgogi fries are amazing, and they give you a TON. Even with 3 people sharing it as an appetizer, we've had to bring home leftovers. It's just the perfect blend of cheese, salsa, and bulgogi on a bed of french fries.  I've been here a handful of times now, and almost every time I order the fusion burrito with bulgogi beef. Usually, I like to try different things when I go to a restaurant, but when I go to Komex, I'm craving that fusion burrito and can't be deterred.  The service is a little on the slow side, but they're all really friendly. You also have to realize they don't have a really big kitchen to work with. They have even put up a sign recommending you call in first. My hope is that they one day expand or find a bigger place because it is almost like a hole in the wall joint right now.  All in all, Komex has really decent fusion food to offer for a great price. Definitely worth checking out.",

Wow, lots of 5 star ratings so I just HAD to go down and see if the food was REALLY that good or did they just have 88 friends that put down great reviews for them. Well the answer is, the food is REALLY that good and now they have a NEW friend  (89th) to put down a great review for them. I don't think I can add anything to the reviews that hasn't already been said regarding how GREAT the food is so I wont bother to reiterate. But I will say this....I DON'T KNOW how these people make any money! The FOOD is SO good, and the portions are SO HUGE and the PRICES are SO CHEAP, I just could not compute how they do it. I even hinted  that the GIGANTIC 4.99 burrito that was STUFFED with tons of meat would cost at LEAST 8 or 9 dollars where I'm from. Hell a Chipotle burrito with sour cream and guacamole is around 8 bucks and the food here is MUCH more worth the money and MUCH more flavorful. I would go here over Chipotle any day! So, bottom line, go there, get full, enjoy the flavors, and you will be very very pleased that you did.",

Chips, salsa and guac were also very good and the service was EXCELLENT.  Wish we had one of these in my home town.  Would definately go back on a future trip to Vegas.  It isn't on the strip but it isn't far if you have a car.   If we would have known how large the portions were are family of 4 could have eatten for $10!  Can't do that on the strip!

    "text": "August 12, 2011  This is fusion food to the max!  Pros:   +  awesome combination of multiple ethnic cusines   +  friendly service   +  complimentary chips , dip + homemade guacamole   +  good prices  Cons:   -  no refills  -  parking plaza is tight... making parking a pain.  Overall:   A must try for those who want to try something different    Bulgogi Burrito... like seriously !!!!  It's pretty intense on the tongue.  They even bring you sauces where you can choose to top off your food with a mexican style or korean style sauce.  There's a third sauce, but I forget what it was ha.  I came here with my girlfriend and we ended up ordering the Bulgogi Burrito, fish tacos, a couple drinks, and chow mein to go (for lunch at work).  Everything I ordered was really good.  The burrito was huge and exploding with flavor.  If you like Korean and Mexican food, this is the perfect place for you.  Aside from blending Korean and Mexican, they managed to squeeze other cultures into the mix.  They've got Chow Mein, Burgers, Boba, and Chicken Wings on the menu as well.  Unfortunately, there are no free refills, but no biggie.  The fish tacos looked amazing.  You can see the quality  in the chunks of fish that was in the taco.  It was a bit too salty for my taste, but really good nonetheless.  The complimentary chips / guac/ salsa was a nice touch.  The chips were a bit soft (it would have been perfect if they cooked it a minute longer), but were very satisfying.  When lunch time came around, I opened my to-go container only to find a over-flowing heap of chow mein waiting for.  It wasn't my favorite item from what we had ordered, but there quantity was very generous (it wasn't bad, but no match for the Bulgogi Burrito).    Tips:  *  when headed north on Decatur (from 95), it's on your left side across the street from the Ford Dealership in a plaza.  I mention this because I drove right past it the first time.  *  Try the Bulgogi Burrito or taco for sure.  I didn't try the taco personally, but I'm assuming it's just as good as the burrito.  * Order the chips well done and it'll be perfect!  *  Come hungry... the portions are generous for the price.",

    "text": "I usually don't do yelp reviews but this new husband & wife business deserves a great review.   There's been a lot of comparison to the LA Kogi tacos so I had to try this new spot out... it looks like just another ma&pa place from the outside. We were greeted by the wife. She served us complimentary chips & salsa. By other reviews, we already knew what we wanted to order: bulgogi burrito and bulgogi & daejigogi tacos. Nowadays, everyone knows how the value of a dollar is slowly going down. And that is why the food was incredibly cheap!! $5 for the burrito and $1.29 for a taco!! WOW... we definitely got our money's worth! Quality of the food was great! the meat was marinated very well and tender. And they also give you the option of the kimchi on the side (as it maybe overbearing for others) or in the food itself. The portion of the food was huge but I still managed to eat it all!! yea.. it was that delicious!! Later, the husband served us complimentary pork skewers! OMG! More tasty food and free?? Don't mind if I do. And when they presented our check, they gave more complimentary food: peeled & sliced oranges. The total for 2 people was only $17.. included 2 sodas, 2 huge burritos and 4 tacos. Seriously, we probably ate $30 worth of food!  We usually don't meet a lot of restaurant owners. The wife, Linda, was very nice and personable. She told us the history on how they opened up the place and asked where we were from.  And, by the time we left, she greeted us by our first names.   I am definitely returning back this week!! they've got us locked in!",

Add in a free yelp check-in offer of fried wontons and a neatly presented orange wedges for dessert and I was very impressed!

I've come here more than a handful of times and I've gotten their burritos, mongolian beef, and tacos. But none of that compares to the fries they serve. These fries taste like fries that food gods DREAM to eat. Ughhh, they're soooo cheesy you can never pick up just one fry, the cheese just drags more fries with it. It's that cheesy! And to set it off the jalapenos give that extra spicy bam in your mouth.  Parking is shouldn't be that bad, but the wait times are very unstable. Some nights its a 30 minute wait, other nights no wait.  Another plus is the service. If you do dine in it comes with some free chips and salsa, and an orange :)  . I usually haven't had a problem with long waits for food or refills.  If you're in the area definitely give this place a chance! You will not regret it!   P.S. If you're in a rush call in advance and you can pick up the food!!!!",

The staff is very nice and attend to your needs.  Cons: It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place so it is smaller with little emphasis on decor. The parking lot is also on the smaller side but totally worth the trouble for the food.  Overall: Yes, yes, and yes! I'm all about quantity and quality with food and this place hits the spot! Highly recommended for delicious food for a good price!",

    "text": "I knew I had to go to this place when I saw it on LV's top five restaurants lists. My need to come became urgent when I discovered that 5 of my Yelp friends gave it five stars. When I realized it was less than two miles from home, I rearranged my plans and went by last night.  I love Korean, I love Mexican, and I really love fusion. The menu made my mouth water, and from the sound of it, this place was poised to become my new favorite restaurant.  But somehow I was underwhelmed. BF and I went a little nuts and got the bulgogi nachos and the bulgogi cheesesteak, then added in the won ton soup for good measure. The nachos were tasty, but after getting the free chips and salsa/guac it was almost chip overload. The cheese was plentiful yet subtle, and the salsa had a light fruitiness to it- a lot of different flavors somehow came together really well. The cheesesteak is the stuff dreams are made of, for my BF- he inhaled it. Huge portion, great value for the price, but for me it lost the excitement after a few bites and the fries were just right (in terms of cooking- they were perfectly crisp) but bland (no salt or seasonings). The won ton soup was our only non-fusion item and it was a good-sized portion with plenty of won tons and a light yet flavorful broth, with lots of onions. The description mentioned mushrooms but I only found one- not clear if they were inside the 'tons and one popped out, or if there were meant to be more.  Service leaves a lot to be desired. Only one waitress for the whole place, fairly slow and a bit too casual for my liking, but we did get our food and their business did pick up so I should probably not be quite so picky.  Overall, the food was tasty- enough so that my BF ordered a burrito go to to take to a friend he wanted to introduce the food to- but after so many five star reviews and a great rating, I just had hyper-inflated expectations, I guess. Will be trying the burrito myself next visit- wasn't in the mood for one last night, but maybe that dish will push me into five-star territory.",

My problem was, I ordered a sandwich, because I wanted to eat quickly and without hassle. I had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork - as soon as I unwrapped the sandwich, the entire thing exploded on my plate.  Second visit, I went for a burrito, again, I wanted something quick and easy to eat, what's easier to eat than a friggin burrito? Again, as soon as I unwrapped the burrito, the thing exploded, it had a rip length-wise down the burrito. Back to the knife and fork for a second time.  Flavor-wise, food quality, and service are all great there. I just really, really would like to eat my meal as intended. I get frustrated with pain in the ass food (I get hungry mid-meal, so the faster I can eat food, the better), hence the reason I order what should be quick to eat.Having to just empty food onto a plate and pick at it defeats the purpose of ordering certain items.  One more try, then I give up.",

The first taste is a party in your mouth with the taters, the pork belly, bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.  It is so flavorful.  It comes in a cask iron pan.  It was soooo good.  I'm still craving it today.  Very good and creative.  Must try.   We also tried all the variety of tacos.  You must get it with the kimchi.  It makes all the difference.  They were very generous with the filling and at $2 a taco, you can't complain.  It was so good.  No extra charge for the kimchi which is awesome.   You get complimentary chips and salsa.  I highly recommend.  Must try.  It will not disappoint.",

The people who run the place seem very nice and are super accommodating.   It is a little cramped but the tasty food makes up for having to nearly brush elbows with the person next to you.   When I'm in Vegas, I will be back!  Oh, I had the bulgogi and rice which was delish but I have to say that I did miss all the side items that usually accompany traditional Korean restaurant meals.",

Come really hungry because you're going to want to \"overdo it\" and order way more than is reasonable for a party of your size.   You'd be wise to only look at the \"Fusion Specialties\" section of the menu. Our bellies were so happy: - Bulgogi nachos - hot damn! These might be my 'last meal' - The four hot sauces available on the table:  unique, not too spicy, flavor packed (you're going to want to put them in your bag/purse) - Fusion wings - extra crispy, only slightly spicy and slightly sweet - perfect to share - Fusion flautas - YUM, everyone seemed to be ordering these, so we did too - Fusion enchiladas - also yum, although we couldn't tell which enchilada was which meat (we ordered the combo)   If you're visiting Vegas and have a rental car, this place is 120% worth a visit.   I'd dish out five Yelp Stars if it weren't for the woman who was our waitress - who aslo seemed to be the manager. She had a bit of an attitude that put us off and also constantly yelled at the other staff (in front of customers).",

I told her once you try this place out, I guarantee you will come back to this restaurant.  We both came here on a Friday night and the place was packed and very busy.  Given, it's a Friday and I normally don't come on the weekends.    As always, the staff of KoMex greeted my friend and I with a friendly hello and seated at a table right away.  As soon as my friend and I were seated,  we placed our orders.  Since this was my friend's first time here at Komex, she ordered the Fusion Burrito with Bulgogi Beef and all she said to me was it was AWESOME.  I told her I wasn't joking and I knew what I was talking about.   I had the usual, the fusion tacos, but this time I got Beef and Chicken.  As always, it was awesome.  I wanted to try out the fried rice since everyone raved about it here on Yelp, so I asked my friend if I ordered to please have some with me, so she agreed.  Three words on the fried rice...OMG!!!  Enough said.  My friend enjoyed her burrito and we both couldn't finish the fried rice, so I decided to give it to her and have her take it home to her son.  My friend and I will be back again.  Thanks again KoMex.",

I prefer the burritos at Cafe Rio, these are about the same size (huge) but not quite as good.   The standout was the tacos, spefically the beef ones, these are what is gonna get me back there.

They were both good, and even tastier with the hot sauce (salsa?  kim chi?  kim chi salsa??).

I had the double-meat Bulgogi plate with beef and chicken, no rice and steamed veggies, and it was absolutely perfect for the slow-carb lifestyle I'm leading. Both the beef and chicken Bulgogi were perfectly cooked (i.e.: not dry and nasty), moist and tender and FULL of awesome flavor. The veggies were also perfectly al dente (not mush/not raw), tasting deliciously fresh and with just enough crunch to satisfy.   My friend had the Bulgogi beef burrito... and damn that was more than a little epic! Bulgogi stuffed inside a flour tortilla, with rice and cheese, and then topped with salsa... Damn fine!   There was a selection of Korean and Mexican sauces and salsas to choose from, each of them wonderful; not too spicy, but with enough of a zip to your your attention. All full-bodied in their flavor, and did not disappoint  I highly recommend this establishment, for comfort food as well as for low-carb lifestylers .",

I had just read a magazine article where their Fusion Burrito was actually rated one of the very best in the entire US!  Now that's really setting a high level of expectation.  We stopped by for a midafternoon mini meal to just share a couple of items.  The Fusion Burrito with pork bulgogi was good but it didn't blow me away by any means.  Maybe I'm jaded by the numerous good burritos from SoCal. The Fusion Fries with beef bulgogi were slightly disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the fries themselves and the toppings were on the skimpy side.  The service here was very nice and friendly and that counts for a lot.   I've had Korean fusion food in SoCal too and I thought I've had better back at home.  I highly recommend Urban Seoul in Irvine.

Before moving to Las Vegas I lived in Michigan, where we didn't have many Korean restaurants to begin with, nonetheless any that were infused with different cuisines.   I'm Korean and Korean food is my absolute favorite. I couldn't fathom how Mexican food could be mixed into Korean food... The creativity that exists on the West coast!  I went with my roommate at the time and we got Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi fried rice, and split the Bulgogi nacho fries. The nacho fries was the infused dish and it was surprisingly delicious! There were a lot of different flavors but it actually worked. Bulgogi, cheese, pico de gallo, Korean gochujang sauce. Sounds like a lot going on but I would definitely order these again!  The Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice wasn't anything special but not bad tasting. I think I could whip up better... :)  Overall I would give it a 4/5; awesome KoMex fries, and average Korean fried rice.",

    "text": "If there was a fashion statement for food, it would definitely be fusion food! A lot of restaurants are trying different combinations and mixes and I think the best would be Korean and Mexican fusion food. When I found out about KoMex, I knew I had to give it a try. After reading the Yelp reviews and looking through pictures, I was impressed and my stomach was speaking to me... like it needed some KoMex! I'm just kidding, but really though, I was impressed now the only thing was to try it!   There are two locations in Las Vegas now. When I first found out about this place, the only location was the one on Decatur/Washington. (I have yet to try the new one located on Buffalo/Flamingo). The location is somewhere more north of Las Vegas so a lot of the buildings are older and smaller. The plaza where it is located is in a plaza where there is a limited parking spot. Every time I go, I find a parking spot so i'm sure its not that bad! The moment you walk in, the restaurant is small, but it smells so good! Service is great! You are greeted immediately and sat down to a table.  Every table gets a complimentary chips and salsa with guacamole. The guacamole is so good and taste very fresh! Everything on the menu is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant except it says \"Fusion\" before it. I thought it was funny! Anyway, some of the food that I have tried:  Fusion tacos- I usually get the pork belly tacos and the bulgogi tacos with flour tortillas. Oh man, oh man... what can I say about the pork belly tacos... IT'S AMAZING! The pork is so fatty and cooked perfectly! Its not tough and its so juicy! They put the pico on top with shredded lettuce and the sauces that the server gives you once your food is ready! Bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine! The beef is cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness to it! All the tacos are delicious and you have a choice of flour tortillas or have them with a lettuce wrap!  Pork-belly fries- Okay, by now I think you should get the hint that I love pork belly. One of my guilty pleasures! Think of carne asada fries, but with pork belly and the special sauces that they add and jalapenos! It is that good! Must try for yourself!  Pork-belly musubi- It was a special at that time, but i'm sure you can order it. Just like spam musubi, they replace it with pork-belly. It was a bit too oily for me so I wouldn't really order it as much. Only when I crave for it!  Fusion chimicanga- I had this with bulgogi and man.. its HUGE! I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good nonetheless!  My favorite here would definitely be the tacos. Man, i'm getting hungry just writing this review.",

Fish taco (4 stars): Liked these tacos the most. Had the most flavor.   Shrimp taco (3 stars): Shrimp are so tiny! Wish I would have known it was baby shrimp.   Chicken Fries (3.5 stars): A little bland. Needed more flavors. We loaded on hot sauce haha. I lived in San Diego for 4 years where Mexican food ruled, so these cannot compare to the pollo asado fries I would get down there.    Complimentary Cips (4 stars): Crispy and good! So addicting to munch on.    SERVICE (5 stars) Everyone was really nice.   ATMOSPHERE  Almost like a fast food restaurant but not since you can sit down and they will come to get your order. Clean tables. Got pretty busy towards closing time.",

My usual order is the Bulgogi fusion fries. Bulgogi is beef that had been marinated Korean style. It kind of has a sweat taste to it. You can also get the fries with any other meat that they have like: carne asada, chicken, etc.  They also have spam masubi w/ fried egg which I think is pretty cleaver. Because we all eat spam and eggs together anyways so why not in a masubi!   Also when you order a soda they bring out a bottle soda & not a can or from a fountain.  Last visit took a while for our orders to be taken and for water to arrive. But, other times I been here service has been steady.",

Overall, the menu has decent variety of Ko-Mex selections, ranging from burritos, tacos, fries, rice, etc.  We ordered:  1. Fusion Burrito ($7.50): You can choose from beef/chicken/pork as your meat. The burrito comes with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. Overall, the burrito was delicious and the flavors were great. This is great for sharing between 2 people. (5/5)  2. Fusion Flautas ($8.00): They come in 3 pieces. You can choose between beef/chicken/pork bulgogi, but we opted for one of each just to get variety. The flautas are rolled in flour tortillas and deep-fried with guacamole and cheese. YUM! The chicken was our favorite as it was tender and juicy. We thought the pork was a bit too spicy for our taste, and the beef was all right. (4/5)  KoMex is off the strip and more of a hole in the wall place. Locals love it and I am a fan! The service is pretty friendly too.",

It's very hard to find good vegetarian food, and this place surpasses all expectations!   Tofu tacos with kimchi - DELICIOUS! The tofu is expertly cooked (nice sear but pillowy center) and flavored well. The Komex slaw is tangy and delicious and they have the best kimchi I've had!  Fries - I also got the bulgogi fries but omitted the meat! The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious cheese and I could drink the Korean hot sauce! This will be a staple!   Beef Bulgogi Chimichanga - Husband got this one! He said the meat was flavorful, tender and plentiful! The Mexican rice was perfectly cooked and it had just the right amount of slaw and sauces!  Chow Chow with Shrimp - He states it's a fine dish and the shrimp were great but it lacked the flavor other dishes had.   Wontons - Husband says these are a MUST have! The meat is amazing and the sweet chili sauce is fantastic. Easily worth three times the price!   We will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try other dishes!",

The burrito was tightly packed with ingredients evenly distributed. Each bite was very satisfying with a good amount of bulgogi, mexican rice, cilantro, onions, etc. Their hot sauce rack has a variety of hot sauce with different flavor and spiciness level which makes it very fun to try.   We also tried the spam musubi and pork belly musubi. The musubi are on the thin side and with less rice than the ones I usually have. Nothing too special about these two. The complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole was very nice. And service was attentive and friendly. I'd be back!",

Parking: I'm guessing during the day time this parking lot gets packed but luckily Komex has its own strip mall parking Thumbs up  Atmosphere: Being from Hawaii the place is alright. Kinda old school looking. Otherwise its not much to look at. Basically what I would expect out of a Hawaii Plate lunch restaurant  Service: All I can say is the service was fast, food came quick and everything worked out great  Cost: In Vegas standards this place can be really cheap or somewhat on the pricer side. Either way I think for a complete meal your looking to spend at least $6 per person.  I had a half order Kalbi nachos and 1 taco and I was pretty good and that was about $7  Food: Seeing all the Yelp reviews I had to try the bulgogi Nachos and a pork taco.  Both items were definetly worth the money.  The Pork taco had a tad bit of spicy but was tasty and not to faty.  The BUlgogi half or nachos was pretty good and loaded with meat, cheese, salsa and other toppings.  The Bulgogi had a nice flavor and you know it had to be marinated for hours.  I do have a feeling that the nachos were zapped in the microwave oven though.  Overall: If your looking for cheap and easy then this is the place. I waiting for my next trip to Vegas so I can try the highly recommended fried rice.",

    "text": "Yelp comes through again I feel like I hit the jackpot finding out about Komex. I was hungry and on the strip but I didnt feel like spending a arm and a leg for just a meh meal. Came accross this gem and decided to make the trek. Its pretty far from the strip it was ten miles and about a 15 minute drive.  Sunday afternoon at 1:00 pm and it was pretty dead. Our server was really nice helpful and patient with us gave us good advice as far as what to order.  We went with there carne asada mexican burrito, the bulgolgi cheestake and a single bulgolgi flauta. My girlfriend loved her burrito being a san diego native and so close to the border she knows her mexican food. Not traditional but it was executed really well portions were great as to amounts of ingredients as well as overall size.  I loved my bulgolgi Philly cheese steak. It was really messy fork and knive were necessary.  I would definitely recommen it if your a fan of Philly cheese steaks. Fries sucked in my opinion soggy and lifeless. But that just made me fill up on there other awesomenss. I almost forgot while we were waiting they brought us some great guacamole and chips for free too. The flauta was good a little fluffier than im used to but still really enjoyable.   Im lucky this place is a state away.  If it was any closer it would be bad for my waistline.  Worth the drive from the strip. Ill be back next time im in town.",

    "text": "Wow!  Amazing food experience.  My taste buds were happy.  I read the yelp reviews and couldn't resist trying KoMex for lunch.  It is a very small restaurant so my family of six decided we would do take-out and eat back at our hotel.  It was about a 20 minute drive from the strip about 8 miles away.   I am a foodie, so it takes a lot to impress me.  I was impressed with the quality of the food.  It was a flavor explosion, like nothing else I have ever eaten.  We ordered all of our food to go and I still gave it 5 stars.  I knew we would lose some of the texture on the way back to our hotel.  I ate the food about 30 minutes after it was cooked and it was still amazing.      We ordered from the fusion menu; beef chimichanga, chicken tostada, chicken wings and Bulgogi Nachos.  We also added the tofu fried rice.  The flavor combinations where like no other.    I would highly recommend this restaurant for the food quality alone.  The restaurant itself is very small but take out worked great for my family.   Thank you KoMex keep up the quality work.",

I Yelp'd Mexican and Korean restaurants nearby us just to see our options and KoMex was the first to pop up.  I didn't expect to find a fusion restaurant with both foods combined but I was so happy we did.    The food is delicious (bulgogi fries are my favorite) and nothing we have ordered was ever wrong or bad.  This quickly became one of our favorite places to eat.    It's very small and usually when we go there is a short wait.  They don't apologize for taking time to make your food (it's not fast food) and they don't have fountain drinks (cans of soda or water).    Prices are very reasonable and staff is super nice.    I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Korean or Mexican food.",

Three things I haven't seen mentioned:  First, the absolutely amazing wonton appetizer! It's a buck for four of them with more meat than you've ever seen in a regular ol' wanton. Unbelievably good. Seriously. Whatever combo of meat, spices, and onions they're using is fandamntastic! It's served with Thai sweet chili sauce and a little dab of the chipotle style salsa on top just takes it straight to the stratosphere!  Get one order per person or you'll end up screaming \"MINES!!!!  MY PRECIOUSSSSS! Yous wants to takes it from me!\" at your dining companions.  Next, Mr. B's Ghetto Ramen. Here's a big bowl of ramen noodles with some egg, onions, and a cut up hot dog in it. It's not a hot dog, though. It's an Asian mildly spicy sausage. My son ordered it and it was too spicy for him, so I took a stab at it after stuffing my face with three tacos.  could not stop eating it.  Lastly, their iced tea rocks. I was pleasantly surprised to see Stevia in the Raw offered as their non-sugar sweetener.  The lady who owns the place is an absolute sweetheart! She's asking everyone where they live so they can consider another location. You will feel good supporting this family business.",

So I got served well.   What I had: I ordered the half order of bulgogi fries and the kimchi fried rice with egg.  When she brought out my fries, the cheese on it was great.  The quality of the cheese is of course better than average because when I pull a few fries out, the cheese actually streches out instead of snapping on instance.  The bulgogi meat in the fries were delicious, not hard as a rock like some places that make terrible carne asada.  Good thing I ordered a half because it was very huge.  The kimchi fried rice was a full size dish.  I have got to say, it was very different.  The flavor was light and not overpowering.  The meat, was of course the same as the fries.. GOOD.    I have got say, that the pricing is very decent for the portion.  The service is excellent because when I asked for a togo box, she brought me my box and half an orange already sliced up.  Always nice to have something that's like a dessert.  BONUS.  I noticed they had all the condiments up front (Tapatio, different hot sauces, etc.).  She also brought it out with my fries.    I WILL come back, just sadden that it's far out of my way.  Place also accepts AMERICAN EXPRESS!.. Whoo! Parking is might be a drag at certain times since it's a shared lot with other stores.",

In no way did they skimp out on the taco itself. It was full of meat and veggies. The pork belly was deliciously succulent but not too fatty-feeling and the combination of lettuce to spices complimented the pork in the corn tortilla. perfect.  Bulgogi Burrito Sweet, moist and succulent! yes this burrito was awesome. It had just enough sweetness from the bulgogi's marinade to accent on to the mexican rice within the burrito. Ok i'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  If you're in vegas this is a must try!  It's missing a star because it closes at 9 pm :( boo I wish it was open later!",

I just ordered two bulgolgi beef and one spicy pork.  I have a 6 year old.  Kids go apeshit for hot dogs.  Generally, though, he is anti-new flavors.  Kids are morons when it comes to tasting new and strange things.  HE LOVED IT!  SO DID I!  Caps off.  The hot dogs are on large buns and topped with all sorts of deliciousness (pico de gallo, jalapenos, bacon, asian slaw, etc.).  Two dogs is more than enough for one massive man with a lumberjack appetite.  I had two... But I'll hit the gym in a while to work off the deliciousness!",

    "text": "I was craving some messy goodness so I decided to come here since there has been so many positive reviews.    SERVICE BREAKDOWN: When we first walk through the door, there were 4-5 seats with 2 people already seated.  I thought there was a line so I sat and waited to be asked how many in my party, etc.  Nobody stopped by, nobody acknowledge that we walked through the door.    After waiting about 5 minutes, I finally asked the 2 people next to me if they were waiting to be seated since they just got done cleaning 2 tables and was told no, and that they were here to pickup their take out.  I was extremely unhappy since I was starving and really wanted food!  I actually reconsidered going somewhere else to eat...   I finally had to stop a waitress and told her I needed a table for 2 and she told me to wait a few minutes.  Thankfully a minute later we were seated.    After all that misunderstanding, the service quality quickly turned around.  The waitress, who I believe is the wife, was friendly and polite.  All the staff stopped by our table throughout the meal to make sure we liked everything and check if we needed anything else.   FOOD BREAKDOWN: Chips and Salsa (complimentary) - I really loved that the chips were made there and not the typical store bought ones.  The salsa and guca was not spicy which was fine since we werent told that it was spicy.  I did like that they had a spice tray (similar to the ones you would see in a Thai restaurant) so you can really make it spicier if needed ^_^  Fusion Chimichanga (Fried Burrito topped with Enchilada Sauce, Marinated Cabbage, Onions, Cillantro, and PIco de Gallo) - I picked the Spicy Pork as the meat of choice for this dish and it was flavorful but had no kick to it whatsoever.  I will say for the price ($7.99) the size was completely worth it ^_^ It was pretty much the size of my head which was totally awesome!  The chimichanga was loaded with the topping and served on a warm plate.  This is not something you cant eat with your hands!  Fusion Bulgogi Nachos (Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno, and Korean Hot Sauce) - We did a half order and I wished i got the full! This was my favorite thing out of the two items.  I wish other restaurants made their own chips cause it was what made the dish!!  I loved that you can add Kimchi without any additional cost!  It was so delicious that I need to go back and order this again.",

Would have LOVED to try out more of their fusioned foods but man 4 lettuce wrapped (low-carb) tacos filled me up.  Went here for a 2nd round taco eating contest UYE. Winner narfed down an amazing 12.5 tacos. TWELVE AND A HALF!!! i was stuffed after 4 and those were low-carb'ed.  All the meat choices were pretty awesome, if i were to pick a favorite...i would just get them all. Are they a bit on the small side? Sure, they are street style after all but man oh man KoMex doesnt hold back when they stack the toppings on.   Also love the way they dice up the kimchi so you can get some in every bite.

    "text": "I've been to Komex a couple times now.  I first visited when they were brand new and gaining a following on Yelp.  While I was impressed with their pricing, I wasn't as impressed with their veg-friendly items we ordered.  There were no Korean-Mexican fusion eats for this girl.  It took a while for us to make it back, and the thing that changed was that they added tofu to their menu.  While I'm not a big tofu eater, I thought maybe this addition could help improve some of the times on their menu so I decided to finally stop back.  Guess what?  I can finally get fusion things here!  Hooray!  I'm a big, big fan of the tofu fusion tacos.  The tortillas are fresh, the marinated cabbage adds nice crunch and flavor, and it all comes with a selection of sauces to add!  The tacos are filled to the brim, so a fork and knife are pretty necessary here.  I've also had the Chow Fettuccine noodles.  They aren't bad, they aren't spectacular, but they are a decent noodle with tons of veggies for an awesome price.  It's definitely a cheap way to fill you up.  My husband has ordered the veggie burrito (not fusion) and I don't care for it too much.  They add broccoli and baby corn and some other things that I think make it a little strange.  But my husband likes it and that's all that matters.  I have a feeling meat-eaters really enjoy this place.  Good food, great prices, awesome people.  Definitely worth a trip.",

Fortunately, they've been able to take us everytime!!!  The customer service is fantastic and the food comes out quickly even though they have been very busy each time we go there!  It's located a long way from the strip, especially if there is traffic, but it is so worth the trip!!  So far, all our family and friends have been very happy with the food they've had at KoMex.  Personally, my favorite thing on the menu is the Fusion Bulgogi Nachos!!!  If you are a nachos fan, then you have got to try this item!!  It is the best nachos that I have had anywhere!!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!    It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you have got to give this place a try!!  You won't be disappointed!!  Another positive about KoMex is that it is inexpensive and they give generous portions!!  Even the leftovers are yummy!",

The fusion of korean and mexican is so genious they complement each other so well.  we had spicy pork, kim chee tacos, a large burrito with everything in it and the best nachos ever and side orders of kim chee.  please open one up in hawaii so we dont have to long for the food all year.  this place is really a must try, we were served by the owner herself, the service was quick, clean, and prices reasonable, especially the portions are so large, you can try a variety of things and your bill will still be affordable, oh also tacos are only 2.00 dollars and you can have it with kim chee delicious.  hawaii people you will love this place it really reminds you of the cooking we are accustomed to here in the islands a real melting pot of different ethnic cooking,  just so comfy and delicious",

Most of time Yelp can be a very helpful place to find good recommendations. But once a while, you find highly overrated places posted by hyped up yelpers posting with peer pressures. I guess nobody like to be a party pooper.  To justify my little speech, I have to talk about the food. Well, the bulgogi in my burrito tasted just like regular meat. I couldn't identify the Korean flavoring. The chicken and pork tacos were dry. You have to take a sip with almost every bite. I think it's because there was not enough salsa.   Salsa should be fresh made fresh,not from cans if you are serving it in a restaurant. Especially if it's a restaurant with Mexican food. And if you use cabbage instead of lettuce, you will lose the watering effect when lettuce is being chewed. The problem can be fixed by putting more chopped onions and tomatos.  Anyway, just a little suggestion.",

Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, I'm used to Korean food being somewhat healthy and I know depending on the Mexican food you could be looking at the perfect post-drunk grease or something you won't feel ashamed of after you've consumed it.  This food made me feel like I was clogging my arteries midway through the meal. The flautas with spicy Korean pork were somehow bland.  I don't even know how this is possible when spicy pork (mewoon daeji bulgogi) is anything but bland and it's the filling.  I got corn tacos with kalbi and spicy pork, they were okay.  My friend was destroying the kimchi fried rice, I'm not the hugest fried rice fan so I don't feel it's fair for me to try and review it.",

    "text": "The food is great, but it feels as if it's overly greasy. Nevertheless some quick tips!  1. Parking is pretty plentiful. It's in a small strip mall in a not so nice neighborhood.  2. The point of a restaurant like this is to try their fusion offerings, after all the name is Komex! Get a little less authentic on both sides and try the Fusion Burrito or a chimichanga.  3. The meats are pretty good quality and taste pretty good.  4. For those who don't tolerate greasy food, try sticking to the rice plates as opposed to the burritos or chimichangas or tacos.  The food here is good, but some of the things that made it stand out for me as a poor experience was the atmosphere provided by the place. It's a fusion place so it's a little quirky to begin with, but the venue is so small it feels like you're a sardine a sardine can barely living it out. The other thing in regards to ambiance is that during the summer time, it gets incredibly hot and the only thing that Komex does to alleviate this for customers is to turn on the fans that they have. When my girlfriend and I went, we were sweating like two California piggies.  Anyways, the meats and the overall presentation of the meal was nice. The burrito is big and so is the chimichanga. Looking over at other tables, the rice plates and the nachos are really decent for the price. The only complaint I have is the food feels a little heavy on the greasy side. Otherwise, the service was quick, polite, and friendly. Although I like this place, it isn't one of those places where I'm like, \"MAN I've got to come back.\"",

    "text": "You want cheap eats and delicious food and be full for around $12 for two people? Come here. No, really, don't, because the parking lot is small as hell. It's tucked away in a tiny plaza with the smallest parking ever. Not bad at all during the weekday and off-hours though.  The place itself is tiny. There's only one big group table for 5+, but there's about seven-to-eight tables for 4-people. So if you plan on coming with a big group on a friday/saturday night, it's ideal to call ahead and make a reservation. Komex also does pick-up orders.   I've been here several times and it never disappoints.   Chips, salsa, and guacamole are complimentary starters here.   First-timers ought to order their fusion tacos! Tacos are about $2.25 each and you get 3 choices for meat: spicy pork, chicken, or beef (pork is the best!). If you're hungry, 3 is enough for most people. They load that taco up with lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. What makes it fusion? The way they prepare their meat! Korean-style supposedly. The meat isn't fatty or overly greasy. The tacos are balanced well with the overflowing sliced cabbage and rich flavor of the meat.   For the health-conscious, they do offer the taco on butterfly cabbage instead of your normal flour/corn tortilla on the menu. Trust me, somehow it's bigger. You want kimchi too? They offer it as an extra cost as well.  If you're ordering their fried rice (kimchi/regular) or bulgogi fries, they offer both half-size and full-size orders. Their half-orders are formidable! Split-worthy huge. Their full-size are just gut-expanding, self-loathing, raid-your-fridge-at-night huge. Both dishes are loaded with toppings and flavorful. You won't really get \"tired\" eating either one.  My friend and I get a couple of tacos each and split the half-size fried rice normally. So filling that we have argue who has to get the last bite...  At the end of every meal, they come out with a nicely cut split orange as the perfect ending to all that heavy food.   Out of the many times I've been here, they've gone through quite a few servers. For such a small place, sometimes they do neglect refilling my water, especially when it's super busy. But, on most of my visits, it's consistently attentive.   Downside? Not open late nights (they close around 8pm daily) and they are closed on Mondays. Nobody likes mondays anyway.  This place is awesome. I'm not always wowed, but this place deserves five stars in my book. Will it blow you away like five stars might suggest? Probably not, but you can't beat the price, service, consistency, and the solid food.",

I had the chicken nachos and although they were interesting- they were missing a lot of the staples of typical nachos. There were no beans, no normal cheeses and no guacamole. The nachos were also rather bare, and with crap pieces of meat from the chicken. I would probably not get them again.   I also had their cross cross sweet potato fries and those were good but not amazing.   Our server was a nice Asian lady and she gave us great service, but sadly for me that is not enough to make me want to go back here for another mediocre meal.

Once I walked in though, the food smelled SO GOOD! and the workers were so nice and patient with our large group. They were so nice and very accommodating to us, which allowed me to have a great first impression of this restaurant and forget about their slightly tacky Asian themed business sign out front.  They have fusion items on their menu, and they have strictly Korean or Mexican. I tried their Bulgogi Cheesesteak with fries and despite how messy it was to eat, it tasted delicious! We also got Bulgogi Fries to share, which tasted alright to me, but in my opinion, it wasn't anything to die for. I like how you can request to add kimchi to any item we order.

Nice & accurate work Yelpers!  I had the seasoned french fries (only $1!) and shrimp quesadillas which were loaded with shrimp. We will definately be back!",

    "text": "A little late but better than never, review from visit Sept 2011  The freebies upon arrival:  *Home made guac/flour tortilla chips/salsa (chips are a little greasy...but can't complain too much especially when it's free!) *Bottled water....not the nasty tap stuff that tastes like lead pipes  Food...I've only tried their fusion tacos and fusion burritos, but the meat is flavorful/tender....quality of what you would find at the korean bbq places but placed on a tortilla or stuffed into a burrito.  The chicken taco seems like just normal grilled chicken to me...so I would opt for beef or pork tacos.  The portion sizes are generous especially given the fact that their tacos are $1.29 each and burritos are $4.99.  And there's the bonus gift of a side of kim chee if so desired.    Sauces: Chinese sauce-\"nose starts running\" spicy to me...they usually put this with every order unless you request the other sauces. Korean sauce-extremely red in color, but has a sweet-spicy kick...my personal favorite and needs to be requested if ordering to go. Green sauce-never tried...green sauces scare me.  Ambiance....LOL there is none....other than this screams hole in the wall joint.  This place is down right ugly inside....but the friendly korean family that owns this place makes up for the dismal interior.  The seats are a little ghetto...WARNING: for all those without junk in the trunk....if you sit in the wrong spot where there is a hole in the bench cushion you may get sucked in  Rumor has it they are going to open another location soon along the 215....and for those who are too lazy to cook for parties....you can order party platters.  They give you a big stack of tortillas, big platter of meat, and the vegetable slaw/dressing on the side...so you can assemble them fresh at home for a very reasonable price!",

    "text": "Yelp steers us well to a great off the strip find - news at 11!  But seriously, I rented a car on this visit to town so we could partake in some off-strip dining a la Yelp recommendations.  Being a lover of Korean & Korean fusion this was a must-try, and I was not disappointed.  They give you A TON of food here.  My honey and I are big folks and big eaters but we agreed afterwards we both should have ordered half orders of our dishes.  He got the bulgogi nachos and I got the bulgogi fried rice.  I ate less than half of mine and was stuffed.  He ate about half of his.  This is a GREAT place to feed a family on a budget!  Alas we didn't have the whole family so we had leftovers.  GET THE HALF ORDER unless you are sharing - you have been warned.  I love their chips.  They alone are worth a visit.  And, they serve them with guacamole which is a huge plus.    I would have preferred bigger slices of bulgogi in the rice, it was actually a bit difficult to tell it was bulgogi fried rice vs. some other fried rice, until I put the sweet chili sauce on top which gave it a more distinctly Korean flavor.  The bulgogi nachos had a bit bigger chunks on them, and they were good too - surprisingly a totally different flavor profile than our local DFW korean fusion place's version of korean nachos.  The server was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed by the lunch crowd that piled in right after we did.  It's not fast food so don't come when you're in a hurry, but do go.  It's different and it's good and it's a bargain.",

    "text": "This place was amazing. I would like to thank the yelping Elite community for recommending this place because I have a few family members adding this to their itineraries for their next Vegas trip. We ordered a variety of items like their chicken wings and fries which had a great sauce and the size were similar to a Buffalo Wild Wings which is good in my book. Also I had their order of pork belly Musubi which went done good with some teriyaki sauce and their red hot sauce. Then we added the chicken fried rice and the Bulgogi Plate with white rice which my boys loved. My mom really enjoyed the fried rice and she is not easy to please. Now what do I say about their Chow Fettuccine other than it was very good but nothing similar to a chow mein dish from a mall but it seemed familiar which is delicious and comforting all in one bite. Lastly my sister had their fish tacos which she said were amazing. I also tasted them and I did enjoy but I swore I would go back and try their Fusion Chimichanga because I was so impressed with everything I had.  The service was amazing and the place is just a hole in the wall that does their food right. They sat us in less than ten minutes on a Saturday afternoon with a party of six so we did not lose out on our vacation time. Also this place is a short freeway drive from the Strip which is why we were in the area. All in all a must try and definitely a must return on our next trip.",

I also enjoy their trio of sauces/salsas  Honestly not a fan of their kimchi fried rice...uber greasy!  It gets 2 stars.  The signature bulgogi nachos also weren't as good as I was expecting...3 stars.  Great waitresses & the food comes out in a reasonable time considering how busy it gets.  People call in to go orders when the doors open.  I always manage to get here right as they open, so I haven't dealt with any wait time.  However, the place is always filled up with customers waiting by the time I am done eating.  FYI...they DO take reservations.",

On the surface, Korean/Mexican/Chinese fusion does not sound like it should work.  Well, as you can tell by the reviews & ratings, it does work & work well.  Also, come hungry, because the portions are, ahem, large.  Cheap, too!  Lotsa food & cheap, what every growing boy needs, right?  I had a Pork Bulgogi taco & Chicken bulgogi fried rice.  The classic, eyes too big for my stomach situation.  The taco was tasty & spicy, with a mild sweetness (bulgogi, of course). It was pretty big for a street taco, but, I think that is becoming the trend for street tacos. The chicken fried rice was more than plentiful, with chicken, egg, carrots, peas, & scallions.  Some ginger & garlic in there, too I think.  Light on the soy sauce which is a welcome change from street corner Chinese fare.  The place itself is pretty tight on space & the food takes a bit to prepare, but this is not fast food.  If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to drop in & try.",

My gf and I decided to make the trip out there because we have been on a taco bender for weeks. Plus, Korean and Mexican food fusion...I was convinced that I would like this place no matter what.  Welp...Although the service was top notch.  The food was very underwhelming.  I tried the Steak, chicken and pork komex tacos along with a big heaping plate of kimchi fried rice.  Chicken Taco - Lots of meat but I felt like I was only eating texture and sauces. Nothing at all stood out.  Steak Taco - I enjoyed eating these but compared to all the other taco shops I've been eating, this is one of the weakest steak tacos I've had during this run. I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing.  Pork Taco - Pretty good taco, everything was tasteful and I have no real complaints. Heck, if you stop by, I would definitely get one of these.  As for the Kimchi rice - I don't really know...it's a mindfuck to try to figure out why it was  subpar. No matter the amount of spices and sauces I would try to add, nothing brought out any real flavor.  I don't know if everyone is suffering from groupthink or if I'm becoming a pseudo-hipsteresque \"I go to great places before they were cool even though I never talked about it until after the fact\" nerd, but there are many other places better than this.   I don't think I'll go out of my way to try this place again. But I wish I had a $500 shirt for them to spill water so I can yell, \"HOW DARE YOU SPILL WATER ON THE ROCK's $500 SHIRT? so everyone can know how hypothetically important I am.  #iloweredyourIQby50",

I got the daeji-gogi (bulgogi-style pork) burrito with kimchi, and boyfriend got the same but with classic bulgogi. We also shared some fried beef and pork-stuffed wontons (4 small ones for $1!) and complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I preferred the beef, but both burritos were OUT OF THIS WORLD and we were only able to finish about half each. (We happily saved them in foil and had them as a pre-airport snack later that afternoon.) The service was super friendly, personal, and fast. It had a very family-owned feel, and the menu noted the favorite dishes of their most frequent regulars. I so wish we had something like this in my hometown!",

Fusion tacos for about $1 and fusion burritos for about $4, cheap and nice size portions, I don't remember the rest of the menu but your going to love this place.  Did the bulgogi fusion burrito, the first bite was so out there it was ridiculously good, never tasted anything like it ever, each bite got even better than the last until it was all gone. The owner, Linda I believe, hooked it up, with some pretty good egg rolls, with salsa and guacamole , tortilla chips, oranges for dessert nicely presented, and bottled water. The egg rolls aren't a regular item and need to be ordered in advance. Everything is made fresh so your food gets to you a little longer but well worth the wait. There's also a good selection of bottled juices and sodas. Love this place.",

He loves kimchi and so does my 18 year old. Neither were disappointed. My husband doesn't ask for much, but I already know this made his list of favorites. It wasn't spicy for those that don't enjoy spicy food.   Calamari tacos- I wanted to order something different for us to try today and this was it. I was worried that the calamari would be too chewy and it wasn't. It was not a hit with the kids though so I won't be ordering this again.   Bulgogi cheesesteak w/ fries- my 13 year old ordered this and he completely devoured it. His only complaint was the bread was soggy.   Bulgogi tater tots- soooo good! Tater tots stayed crispy and the meat as well. Cuts were thinly perfect. This has made my list of favorites. A hit with the whole family.   Spam musubi- huge and delicious. Another favorite and will always be included in my future orders. Ono!  Green Tea Macaroon Ice Cream- This is expensive! Wow... It smelled good and tasted even better. What a treat...  I am so full from all the food that we ordered that I haven't tried the others. I will update this tonight when I get hungry again which will probably be in a couple of hours... lol",

First good sign, was seeing a couple police cars in lot, cops are pretty good judges when it comes to good quality cheap eats.   Inside was ok, but didn't expect much since it's Decatur location wasn't flashy like other locations up North or  west.   Food was priced well and came pretty quickly.   We tried the Fusion Tater Tots and Fusion Tostada.  The Tater Tots were great. Good flavor and the Bulgogi and bacon went well with the sour cream and tots.   The Tostada was also good, very different with the crispy rice patty taking place of the hard corn tostada. Though if cooked wrong or if it gets cold, it can be too hard to really enjoy. So eat it quick while it's warm.   Drinks were interesting, but we didn't venture too much on that category. Next time!  Overall, it was interesting and tasty which not breaking the bank.",

Haven't had them booked marked very long I don't think.   Anywho, treating myself to lunch I hopped in and got seated quickly. The place is small and it was jumping!!! I was dining alone and the owner I assume, was very nice and explained the menu since I was a newbie. He was seating people, taking orders, giving directions to an employee who was either new or confused. So kudos to the owner for the many hats he wore while I was in there today.   I ordered the fusion plate of 3 tacos. It came with pork belly, beef, & chicken. No fusion slaw, but kept the Pico. I should've requested lettuce too. While I waited on my tacos they provided complimentary chips & salsa, it took about 10mins to get my food. The beef was hot and good..meat in the chicken was cold, pork belly was warm also. All the tacos were on flour shell & they were good. Good flavors & plenty meat. I will definitely be back to try other menu items. I probably wouldn't come at lunch time next visit. It seemed a little rushed & fast paced, but it was still nice.",

I thought each taco was well seasoned and great portioned. For a street style taco, they were spilling with meat and cabbage slaw. Their Kimchi Fried rice was also super delicious. It has a little Kick but nothing that would require a cool beverage. The food was amazing and that's where the rating comes from. However, don't expect great service. The waitress seemed overwhelmed or just in a bad mood. She didn't have any suggestions and was seen tapping her foot at a nearby table. So if you don't mind bad service for great food, check this place out but leave the high expectations on the food.",

Either way, the service was nice and the food came out super quick. The portions are huge for the price and very flavorful! The Korean spices, kimchi, and endless salsa add a unique and drool-worthy flavor to the dishes. Two dishes (chimichanga and bulgolgi rice bowl) only came out to $20! Definitely a must for those of you trying to save money before you blow it at all the night clubs!   What I really liked about the bulgolgi rice bowl is that it came w a Korean coleslaw and a generous amount of dark leafy greens, not that iceberg lettuce stuff! Although I love the \"bad\" stuff, you gotta have some good stuff like veggies and salad! This dish is a good balance of both! I should know, I'm a nutrition professional!   We had no trouble finding parking and it was relatively easy to find. Try the bulgolgi bowl, you won't be sorry and neither will your taste buds!",

If u have not been yet stop by and get some amazing fusion food. We stopped in on a Saturday morning just as they opened the doors placed our order talked a little and got our food. We went at a good time and a little entertainment. Only in Vegas. So we were eating and another couple w/there children came in sat down ordered food a few minutes go by and I look at the door and see this blue Man looking in thru the window then he takes off I look over at my husband and say did u see that, he only saw a man walking away but another guy inside saw the same thing that I saw so he went to the door and looked outside, then another man looked out the door then this blue Man walk in the door w/his family I did not look at him thinking that he might do something to us but NO he has dressed up and in make-up for a charity event we were all so happy to hear him say that then the next thing u know the cops show up. The other places in the plaza called the police bc this man looked the way he did. I want to say thank u to the police that came bc u never know. The response was so fast, 3 cope cars. They came inside takes to the man we all laughed and they left. With everything that has happened in the last few months. That police of Vegas.  Back to the food hands down the best u have to try it at least once and u will be back trust me.",

Hubby's favorite is the Bulgogi Tostada. At this place, instead of everything being polled on a tortilla shell, the use a deep fried patty of rice. Yup. Pretty awesomely delicious. Hubby also usually gets a couple tacos, too - Bulgogi, calamari, fish.   The service is very friendly and fast. Don't forget to bring cash so you get a percentage off your bill!",

    "text": "Combining two of my favorite cuisines (Korean and Mexican) is a little eatery aptly named KoMex far away from the Strip. For locals and I, this has remained a favorite spot for their fusionesque approach toward comfort food.   Sporting a tiny parking lot and a strip mall locale, the low key vibes of KoMex immediately reminds me of places I'd see in Hawaii (the food also screams Hawaii as well). Dated interior with a homey feel, this unassuming spot has family vibes written all over it. Popular during lunch time but a real casual option in the evening, this place gets better and better each time I visit.  Service gets major points for their willingness to please and the family of youngsters are always putting their game face on. They've been polite and welcoming since my first visit and do a good job despite the demand. Management has done well with keeping the food interesting and affordable. Ordering food can be a bit on the slow side, but they've prefaced this by noting the food is made with love.  They've done well with the bulgolgi and I'm certain have created hardcore fans as a result of it. One could rock bulgolgi fries, bulgolgi burritos, or even the amazingly hearty bulgolgi torta. Go next level with the bulgolgi grilled cheese, bulgolgi tater tots or a traditional bulgolgi plate with rice and salad. With this meat, anything (delicious) is possible.  For non-bulgolgi items, I have been enamored with their beef kimchi fried rice. Order a runny egg and take a deep breath when the yolk magically weaves everthing together. While I enjoy the spicy pork rice plate, I also love the pork belly musubi. Nachos with any of the aforementioned meats is highly recommended.   Don't feel the need to dine in? Go for takeout, but I'd recommend calling in ahead of time. For my fellow hangul speaking friends, this is the antithesis of traditional Korean food, so don't be disappointed when jungols / jigaes are missing from the menu. Instead, come hungry and enjoy one of Las Vegas' most unique local spots.",

    "text": "I think my taste buds have aged considerably during the last five years. I consider it a good maturing. Five years ago I would seek out a little Mexican food every couple of months, and I really enjoyed visiting KoMex...these days?...I can't remember the last time I sought out something other than an al pastor taco. I stopped into KoMex recently though, and felt compelled to write an update.   KoMoex is the right place for you if you enjoy burritos, chimichangas, tostadas, enchiladas, etc. because the Korean fusion sends it over the top...over the top in the good, 1987, Lincoln Hawk kind of way. It really is a great marriage for the standard Mexican food fare we have here in the states.  You come here because you are looking for value that brings some killer taste with it. My issue has less to do with KoMex specifically, and more to the point that there are a lot of other types of food I would rather enjoy...even at these reasonable prices. Additionally, if you're a fan of Korean food, KoMex may not do much for you. I still hold to my previous advice: KoMex is best experience with someone else, so that you can share a larger item from the fusion side of the menu, like a burrito, chimichanga, tostada, or enchiladas (whatever you normally would get at a Mexican place) and then have two or three tacos for yourself!",

The dish is different in different parts Cali, Hawaii, Vegas!\" I didn't want to argue with him but as a reply, I let him know since he let ME know, that he's full Korean, \"Look sir, I'm 100% Asian and I KNOW MY RICE!\"   Along with that, I originally asked for the dish to be served with Tofu and he let's me know that, \"The Tofu was not good because it was frozen in the freezer\".  I find it interesting that he tried to challenge me on my own experience as a customer. The only reason I am giving him a three is because, he offered to replace my dish and even comped it.",

I've had Mexican before. I've never had Korean. So... Would I enjoy a combination? Who knew?  But oh my-- yes! I had the Fusion Nachos and Fries plate with bulgogi beef (a girl needs to eat, you know!) The star was the beef-- and I don't say that nearly enough. Usually I prefer the cheese and other toppings on nachos-- but the beef was perfection. Next time we visit-- I'll choose a dish that highlights the bulgogi a bit more.  Definitely worth recommending to anyone looking for a new place to try.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try KoMex, but it turned out not really meeting my expectations. The food is great if you want either Korean or Mexican, but it wasn't that great at executing fusion flavors. Ex: the bulgogi fries were just fries, cheese, jalapenos, and not very much bulgogi. Plus, the bulgogi didn't taste too much like bulgogi and more just like beef, so then the whole dish was just carne asada fries.  The tacos were similar. The chicken was really bland and not particularly Korean, but the pork and bulgogi were better. The kimchi fried rice was well made, but that's not fusion.  Great service and prices. It was around $20 for 3 entrees.",

Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now!   I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "My overall review 2.5/5 Service 5/5 (but...had the nerve to charge gratuity 20% when we were the only table in the restaurant ?!) Food 2/5 Ambiance 0/5   4.5 stars review from fellow yelpers, but the food just wasn't up to par.. Something's not adding up here..  *note for the cook, not every dish needs black pepper, less is more sometimes! Not sure if you have tried your food lately but most of your dishes are missing something !! This is Korean Mex fusion , here's a clue, add some creamy sauce to your Mexican inspired dishes*  Now .. My Background .. I'm from California so maybe the fusion here  just can't beat it. Most of the dishes seemed to be missing just a little something... I was not impressed. We came here from Utah after hiking all day. Our group of 7 was hungry and ready to chow down.  I'll start with the best and go down the list. Here is what we ordered.  Kim chi fried rice 5/5 I'm a sucker for kim chi fried rice, some people like it, some don't. Me, I love a good kim chi fried rice. This dish packs a moist and flavorful punch in every bite. This is a must order!  Bulgogi cheese steak 4/5 Docked one star because you need to put sauce on each bite to taste the fusion. The \"bulgogi\" was not very seasoned. In general it was a good sandwich for you cheesesteak lovers.  Bulgogi chimichanga 3/5 Hey, where's the meat? Totally just a few scraps in my chimichanga  ? This also needed much sauce with each bite... And why was there black pepper poured all over the top? There is never black pepper on chimichangas or bulgogi!! Why did you put it ? It totally threw off the taste!!  Kimchi side dish 2/5 Hmmm, flavor was good, but $3 for kimchi.. And it's served warm and mushy.. Wttthhhhheck?? This should be cold and only served cold..  Spicy pork fusion nachos 2/5 Oh Koja kitchen, you've ruined me for eveyone else. There was no white sauce on these nachos, and this dish too was missing a certain something .. At least there was no black pepper on this one. Also just a few crumbs of meat accompanied this dish.  Wonton 1/5 Don't order it. Wonton skins soft and soggy, meat filling one dimensional, dry and lacking flavor. Again, heavy handed chef with black pepper overload in the soup but forgot to season the meat in the wonton.  Bulgogi plate 1/5 Dry, super plain and bland presentation. Doesn't look Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American ... Don't order this here !!!  Burrito 1/5  I didn't try it but it looked dry and standard.. Very plain..., I asked my friend who ate it and one word. \"Meh\" Nothing special here to try folks!  I dropped my fork and our waitress heard ,( probably due to the empty restaurant and the cling of my fork falling broke the sound of the crickets in the background ) she quickly came over and replaced it right away. Although I rated this 5/5 service, I suppose she earned the 20% gratuity we were never informed of..   Overall, I won't be back. I was wondering how my experience food wise can differ so much from other yelpers. Apparently, another yelper pointed out a change of ownership. That would explain it.  The restaurant was empty during dinnertime, new ownership, you should probably be reading these reviews and stepping up your game..   Btw most people like meat.. And with the little customers your have trickling in now a days, you should probably give people more meat to make them happier with your sub par food, unoriginal menu and dull flavors  Note for hungry yelpers, my ballers on a budget.  If you are hungry and need a cheap bite off the strip, you don't need to come out here! Check out all the Asian restaurants off spring mountain. It's a 2-5 min drive from the strip and you can find anything you want there.",

    "text": "After reading some of the reviews, I had to try it! I haven't had too many 'fusion' type meals and so what better place to have it then somewhere Yelpers are constantly raving about!!  After a couple U-Turns, finally spotted the place.. I would of never noticed this place, probably even if I passed by everyday..  Came with chips, salsa and a guacamole dip: Chips were extra crispy/thick and kinda sweet. Salsa was ok and guac tasted pretty fresh.  Bul-Gogi (beef) taco: The beef tender, juicy and lots of flavor! Topped with Cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions.. Basically what you find in a typical mexican street taco.. All on a corn tortilla.    Daeji-Gogi (pork) taco: The pork, tasted even better than the beef! Wow, I never underestimate the magic of pork but I felt it was slightly tastier!! Same toppings and also on a corn tortilla  * Both tacos were Excellent, they both had a slight distinct bitter bite to them probably from the cabbage and Both were Generously portioned (could probably split each one into 2 little ones by using 1 of the 2 corn tortillas per taco) Also, from the 3 hot sauce condiments (Chinese, Korean and Mexican), I prefered the Chinese hot sauce with either of the tacos (Warning - it definitely packed some heat!) I had Kimchi placed on the side and that was Delicious and another great addition to the tacos or even by itself.  I was gonna order more tacos but I wanted to try something other than the obvious so  I went with:  Pan Fried Fish: some type of white fish, filet on top of steamed white rice and \"marinated soy sauce\" This fish was sort of salty, smokey and just flaked right off. The sauce had that roasted sesame flavor and I believe was the key element of the dish. Poured the sauce all over the filet and every bite felt complete.. Great Strong Flavors and another Good Portioned dish  Unsweetened Brewed Mango Passionfruit Decaffeinated Iced Tea: came with raw sugar and regular sugar packets. I prefer one regular sugar pack per full serving. Smooth and Refreshing!   Orange: Another freebee, a half orange ornately sliced as a fancy looking little fruit dessert..  Service felt very comfortable, Value was very wallet friendly in terms of quality and quantity, Atmosphere don't expect much.. But Who Cares! Come here to get a Great Tasting Budget Meal!",

    "text": "I made my way down here with my partner in crime.  Always when reviewing food you must have a partner in crime so, you can eat more food and therefore give a more accurate description of your opinion.  If you go by yourself, you might not be comfortable eating alone and therefore can color your opinion and that would not be fair to the business or if you come with 6 people and they can't accommodate that can as well color your experience.    Two people or three tops is the magic number to come an accurate and fair opinion of a place.    The place was pretty ghetto.  I mean it wasn't even ghetto with a personality it was just straight up \"hey, look an empty restaurant! let's open up right now.\"    But, I'm not reviewing a furniture store so, ignore it.  To the main course!  I ordered their tacos with lettuce all of them (I'm on a no carb diet so, given up the bread and taken up lots of beans and meat)  My partner ordered the bulgolgi burrito. We got chips and salsa and guacamole for free.  Damn, those chips are good!   my tacos were huge and everything was fresh. no complaint from me.   the bulgogi burrito was hhuuuuugggeee.  It's something you have to pick up two hands to eat with.    I tasted the burrito a bit and the tortilla was nicely crisped.  The rice tasted fresh and not overly salted.  The meat was tender and the veggies in it was nice and crunchy.  Overall, for the price and food it was a great experience.  They deserve five stars for shaming other restaurants for charging heinous prices for mediocre food!   personally, I'd like to see more of the flavor fusion inside of the food.  the condiments has a spicy korean paste that would have tasted good if it was inside the buritto.  spicy and cheesy is a great combination.  Or a lime alioli with cilantro bits would have been a nice sauce. Sesame oil is great and would have stood out really well with all the different foods.    I honestly thought I was eating really good mexican food and it being fusion place just wanted the fusion part to come out to play more.  It's just a personal opinion and don't flame me for it.  I am still perfectly happy and plan on going back cause the waitress there is the best part.  She is so nice and kind and talked with me for moment and explained how their business came about and asked me how everything was.  Really cool people and on my next cheat day I might try their ghetto ramen.  (it comes with hot links! whoop! whoop!) I",

    "text": "OHHHH YEAH!  Love this place and will be going there a lot.  Let's start with their story.  They are a nice Korean couple who ran a Mexican market for 10 years.  Their food isn't a copy of the Kogi truck phenomenon in Southern California but rather a result of their experience at the market. They sold tacos, burritos, etc at their market.  However, they cooked food for themselves.  So they would blend mexican food with korean bbq, chinese food, etc.  Pretty soon customers would ask them what they were cooking/eating and ask if they could try it.  Long story made short - eventually their fusion food was doing much better business than the market itself.  So they made the leap to open up their own restaurant.  Now - on to the restaurant.  It doesn't have a ton of decor but that's to be expected from folks opening up their own business on a shoestring budget.  The food, however, is outstanding.  I had the following:  Burrito with Korean bbq pork.  This was definitely the highlight of my meal.  Served with a side of kimchee (though I'd recommend you ask for it inside the burrito if you want the best experience), the bbq pork is absolutely delicious.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, and savory.  Served with rice and veggies inside.  They serve the kimchee on the side cause they are worried about how Americans will react to it.  But I think you need the tangy kimchee to balance out the richness of the meat.  That's standard cooking.  The owners also bring you 3 hot sauces.  A korean chili, mexican hot sauce, and the owners' own house made hot sauce.  I'm not a big hot sauce person, but the owners' sauce was really excellent and flavorful.  Taco with bulgogi (beef).  A big, meaty taco that has too much to eat without spilling out the fillings.  I don't think that's necessarily great to have so much on top but I know others will love the value.  Served with a lime wedge as is traditional.  Nice tender, flavorful meat with nice crispy veggies.    They serve you tortilla chips and salsa while you wait.  They seen to be from flour rather than corn tortillas which is unorthodox but fine.    The value is definitely there.  It's cheap.  I actually think they should raise the price a buck on all the food and move to a richer neighborhood but that's just me.  I will back here many times.  This is really a hidden gem.",

Tried the fried rice, bul go gi sliders, and a bul go gi burrito. For me the attempt at fusing Mexican and Korean was not a successful one. The flavour was okay but not nearly as spectacular as my buddy thought it was.  Unfortunately,  I didn't see the appeal of mixing the two types of foods together - at least on the dishes we had.  So unless you're really craving Korean and Mexican combined, you can go elsewhere to experience good food. Place also fits the surrounding neighbourhood - aka a dive more or less (which I'm used to with other Asian places but with much much better food).",

Nope! And I'm glad others reviews helped to steer us to this WONDERFUL place during our stay in Vegas. I could only wish that we had found it sooner!   I had the fusion tacos -  Bulgogi beef. $1.29 each.... and worth twice that! They state they're small... but, these pack a mega punch! Soft flavorful beef....the sweet cabbage... the tasty corn tortilla... HEAVEN.  My hubby also enjoyed his meal. He went with the 2 meat combo plate. Bulgogi beef and Dak-gogi chicken. He was only sad that he couldn't finish it all! (and we had no place to heat it up and store it for leftovers in our hotel :(  super sad).  And the fried wontons? A definite must! Try them! I mean, they're only a dollar for goodness sakes!  We came out of there content and stuffed! And, our bill only came to around $20 for everything! (including our passion fruit mango iced teas! yum!)  Last, but not least, the people working there were so polite and gave excellent service. Even while visiting at prime lunch time with a packed house!  I WILL be visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "After many sleepless nights I've decided a name more appropriate for KoMex. ChiKoMeRican Fusion Express.   What the heck is right.   I don't think I've have ever ate anywhere that serves Korean-Mexican fusion, Mexican, Chinese, and American. It is like the food court at a mall fell into a pot and KoMex was the product.   What I like:  - Uber cheap food. For $1.25 you can get a taco, but not just any taco, Korean marinaded beef, chicken, or pork sheltered by two corn tortillas OR protein style (lettuce) at no charge! Good bye Taco Bell Grade D \"meat\".   - It tastes good. YEAAAAAAAA!  - The portions are very generous. You can't even hold a taco without the lettuce, purple cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro falling out.    - Everything is cooked to order, just in case you were wondering why your taco is taking 10 minutes.   - FREE chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. They make their chips from flour tortillas though, but, it is free.   - FREE fruits for dessert. Sometimes I've gotten oranges and other times watermelon.  - Drink selection is pretty interesting. Jarritos, Voss water, typical sodas, lemonade, Starbucks frappuccinos, and I believe I saw a coconut juice drink.   What it is not:  - This is not a Kogi's. KoMex serves food more family like and Kogi's is more street and greasier.  - No Korean only items. I'll live.   - Fancy. It is not in the best of spots, or has nice decor, but it gets the job done.   - Going to make your wallet or bank account cry.  - Going to give you a reason to regret.   yeaaaabuddy!",

I went with a party of 3 and we shared 9.......i repeat......NINE tacos and a chicken chow fun for less than what you woud pay for fast food.  With tax, less than 15 bucks.  INSANE value!  We ordered 3 of the bulgogi (beef), dakgogi (chicken), and daejigogi (pork) tacos.  The beef was by far the best but they were all very tasty.  Be sure to dip in the Mexican, Korean, and Chinese hot sauces.    The chicken chow fun is not the flat rice noodle but reminds me more of lo-mein but with much more texture.  It had the perfect bite and if there were a food competition, I would tear that sh1z up!  This place is awesome - they serve you bottled water (Fo Free), chips and salsa and guac , and bring out fresh oranges, and fortune cookies all for free.  I've had better chips but with all the freebies, quality of the food, and service I can't really complain.  The service was impeccable as the owner stopped by to ask about out experience.  This isn't Kogi but it's pretty damm good and you won't have to drive to LA and fight the traffic.  This place does well because it serves crack addictive food for a fraction of the price while delivering great service.  This place will thrive on their loyal customer.  Definitely check them out!  ****SPOILER ALERT *****  if you haven't heard, they are exploring expansion in the SW....will be by Blue Diamond/  Fort Apache.

We were greeted with smiles and a large bowl of chips, salsa, AND guacamole.   On my first visit I went straight Fusion Taco. One beef, one chicken, and one pork. The waitress asked if I wanted kimchi on top and I most certainly did. All three tacos were fabulous and for $1.29 each you can't really go wrong. My friend and I made the rookie mistake of each ordering three tacos and an order of Fusion Bulgogi Fries (everyone raved about them on yelp so we had to give them a shot). We were so stuffed after the three tacos that we barely made a dent in the fries, but they were great.  On my second visit I went with tofu fusion tacos and even tried one as a lettuce wrap. They were both great, but I forgot to ask for kimchi so not quite as tasty as the first visit.   Visit komex with a big appetite and expect a bit of a wait if you're going at peak dinner/lunch hours. And, don't forget to request kimchi on your fusion tacos!",

Second of all, when I told the lady (she seemed like the owner) about how I've eaten at the Kogi truck in L.A., she already knew the difference between their food and her food and was able to tell me. She was honest saying some people like KoMex more and others still like Kogi more.  Third of all, our bill for 3 people was only $11.80. Granted, 2/3 of us didn't order very much... but still.  Ok so the food...  The chips w/ salsa & guacamole was very good. The chips were homemade and I think the salsa & guac are too. I have had better homemade salsa, but the guacamole was very good.  I had the (insert korean name here) pork taco and bulgogi beef taco. I am not sure how to even describe it, but it was very good. Everything was made fresh. The meat was hot, tortillas were soft and the vegetables were crisp. I would say that I liked the pork one more than the bulgogi one.  After the dinner rush had begun to slow down, the lady who seemed like the owner came to our table not only to check on us, but to talk to us. She was telling us how on weeknights the busy rushes are kind of unpredictable. She was apologizing for the wait since there was only 1 cook that (wednesday) night, but honestly, we didn't even wait that long. If we did, we didn't notice because we were so caught up in conversation.  This place is far from us and they said they would be opening another location closer to 215 & rainbow.  OH and this location has so much character! It is a True hole-in-the-wall. It's the kind of place that looks like you should question eating there, but when you do, it is so delicious!

    "text": "2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.   I've started to identify these restaurants that are Yelp hype-magnets.  They have super high ratings, are generally budget friendly, yet aren't very good when you actually go there to try the food.   I suspected this place was one of these places.   I ordered a few different tacos, the kimchi fried rice, and washed it all down with a sidral mundet.  So you get little tacos and a big platter of fried rice.  The meat quality was average, the seasonings were basic, and the fried rice was copious in quantity, but the kimchi was pretty pathetic and the dish wasn't very good.   There are so many hole in the walls that are truly excellent.  This isn't one of them.  Maybe it's because the place has blown up that it's resting on its yelp laurels?   When I went, there were a couple Mexican families and a few hipsters eating there.   And from what I've noticed, hipsters don't know good food if it smacked the horned rim glasses off their heads.   If it had been truly a good spot, I'd have recommended it, and returned time and time again, but it really was very basic food and not really worth making a special trip that way to go eat there.   If you live down the street, you can praise it to the skies, but for anyone in town for just a few days, this place is an easy pass.",

Our fried wontons, 4 per serving and costing a mere $1, were good, but totally unnecessary since they were preceded by complimentary housemade chips, salsa and guacamole.  Our order of 4 barbecue tacos (2 pork, 1 chicken and a beef) came with cilantro, lettuce, onions and kimchee, the latter being optional.  Each was very good to excellent, though next time I would skip the beef in flavor (sic) of the pork or chicken",

KoMex has really found a way to not only mix the flavors, but I think that they do it better than the others. Their food is less greasy and they have a big menu.   The tacos are really good. I can easily motor down 5-6 of them. The wanton chips are a nice touch and they go great with the fusion theme. Everyone in our group liked the fried rice. Just be aware of the huge portion and the smell of kimchee that will ooze from your pores.   Overall this is good food at a great price. You can easily stuff your face and keep that hard earned money at the same time. I think that the food is 4 star quality but the owner was so nice and she will not oversell you on the food. If you order too much she will tell you. For those reasons alone they get a bonus star.",

All three fusion tacos (bul-gogi, dak-gogi, and daeji-gogi) are great.  The proteins are all deeply marinated, slightly charred and overcooked (it works) and served hot with cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions, all overstuffed in a corn tortilla.  Perfect contrast of both temperatures and textures.  Add some kimchee and hot sauce (several choices but the Asian works best) and you got it all (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy).  Fusion street food heaven!  The burrito is equally good.  Same great beef, chicken, or pork with the same taco toppings and the addition of seasoned rice all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  Once again, squeeze some lime, add some hot sauce and its all good!  (It even taste good cold especially at 2am at the tables).   Prices are...heck, dirt cheap ($1.29 a taco, $4.99 for a burrito).  Dine in and you get free chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Recommended.",

My torta of choice is loaded with bulgogi, lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado and those little sliced pickled jalapenos on a soft roll with a lil mayo ($5.99). I really don't know how to properly describe the fusion taste - it's just incredibly unique and complex.   Komex has just wonderful customer service. When we walked in last night it was packed and there people ahead of us waiting for a table. We were contemplating ordering to go and Linda explained that in the amount of time it would take to make our food a table would open. Well she was correct and within 10 minutes two tables became available and she very speedily took care of us.   Oh and their mango passionfruit tea is amazing. It's unsweetened but is actually pretty sweet and satisfying.",

I wasn't totally sold on fusion before this place.  And my Korean friends cringed when I asked them what they thought of the idea.  But after they tried it, it was all smiles.

I swung by this place because I was hungry and figured that I'd go to a local place that was well-reviewed. When other people say hole-in-the-wall, they really mean it. No decor, no real maintenance done to the place in the last twenty years apart from keeping it somewhat cleanish. The place seemed pretty empty when I was there despite it being near suppertime.  The food basically tasted like standard Chinese food. The nachos were pretty good, but the bulgogi was just your standard greasy American style Chinese. I tried some fish, and it was decently seasoned if overly salty.   With a review of 4.5 stars, I expect a hole-in-the-wall place like this to really really shine on food. This place did not, at all. I might stop by if it were on my way, I was desperately hungry, and didn't mind getting average greasy Chinese food. If I wanted anything else (like, say, good food) I'd go somewhere else. I'm actually suspicious of how the heck an out-of-the-way meh-quality restaurant like this got so many glowing reviews - maybe they're paying for them.",

Very attentive.  Food: 3/5 The food was decent. We had the bulgogi burrito and taco. The burrito was ok, but none of the flavors really wowed me. I also had a bulgogi plate with white rice just to see how it stands against other Korean places. It wasn't up to par. Their wonton soup, however, was amazing.

They have a small kitchen and shorter staff, but they only have about 10 tables, so service is perfect.  However, you might need to wait in line if there's a rush.

Will Korean Nachos be good after driving 4 hours to California? Guess we will see. At least we'll have food if traffic is slow getting back to LA area. Oops spoke to soon, traffic just stopped on the 15 and were nor even to the stateliness. [Nachos may not make it to CA]",

They really have a unique flavor and idea goin on here.   One of my usual items I order is the chicken tostada. It consists of stir fry veggies with an additional (optional) kimchi, and the \"tostada\" part is like a crispy rice patty.   I think my fave part is that \"crispy rice patty.\"   This place has one of the best kimchi I've had, so you know it's authentic.   So with the unique idea, the flavors, and delicious kimchi, I rate this place a 4. I've come back numerous times when I crave for Komex; even since it is out the way for me.",

It may be located a little off the strip and in a not so fancy shmancy area, but the food is delicious and cheap!  I have to comment on the pulled pork sliders because I know it may be a simple dish, but on a sweet and toasted Hawaiian bun?? I may sound silly, but it makes a difference! LOL The Korean tacos are also yummy and piled high. It really amazes me how I can eat Korean, Mexican, Chinese, & American food in one place (by one or two cooks) and have each of those dishes taste amazing! So glad my friend brought me here because I'm definitely coming back on my next visit to LV.",

My daughters are Korean and Mexican mixed and they turned out to be Hawaiian looking!  I would have imagined if you fused Korean and Mexican food you would have wound up with Hawaiian food???  Yes - no... anyways.  Reasons why this place is 5 stars;  You cannot beat the price!  GEEZ.  I felt guilty!  I had 4 fusion tacos, fried wontons, chips and salsa, bottled water... $5.85!    The fusion tacos really are that good.  Korean style pork, chicken, beef in a taco!  The kimchee on top is optional at no charge!!  A perfect orchestra of grilled meat, fresh cabbage, tomatoes, onions, kimchee and I have to guess but a hint of sesame oil...   The owner is running around waiting tables!  This place makes me happy.  I wanted to take my shirt off and rub the taco all over my chest...  I wanted to jump up and throw a corn tortilla 2 tables down hitting Seabass in the back of the head!!! ... is anyone reading this???  The place is in a bad location and quite frankly it is a dump - but the tacos were really that good!!!!!!!!!!!!",

But then we were reassured by the good service we received. The lady was kind of quiet and not super enthusiastic but she was playful and very attentive.  Now... the FOOD! we got the Bulgogi burrito and Bulgogi Beef Nachos. The burrito was alright, good flavor and what not. But the NACHOS were insanely delicious :) It was like the perfect combination of flavors!  I can definitely say this visit was a success and I am beyond satisfied with the service and the food.

    "text": "Def as good as it gets. Remember, it's a hole-in-the-wall with limited seating serving common-man food. If you want haute cuisine, go elsewhere. First night in town, \"Gotta try something new and different.\" We're from Burlington, Vt and while the quality of food ingredients are second-to-none, there are lot of options when it comes to ethnic cuisine. And it can't really get weird, it is Vermont, after all.  Anyhow, KoMex Fusion sounded adventuresome. Having spent time in Seoul and being a big fan of winter-style kimchee, was looking forward to reacquainting myself.  First of all, do NOT order a full order of the nachos unless you're sharing with four or more. Half size nearly did me in. I had it with the bolgogi beef. Hope I spelled that right. Good chips, fine bolgogi, way enough cheese. Had the bolgogi beef burrito as a main course.  Let me tell you, one of the finest burritos I have ever had. Ever. Lots of beef, lots of slaw, great flavors. I am not ashamed (well, maybe a bit) to admit that I hurt myself finishing it off. Kept dipping into the hot sauces, little of this, one bite. Well, how about a little of that. Ummmm. How about a little of each.   Another sign, I did not try the wife's tacos. She might not have let me.   Looking forward to a return visit.",

I was also happy that they had stevia and sugar in the raw as an option for my tea. My food was delicious but I would recommend done thing.

We actually just ended up here unplanned, this past Tuesday we were headed to Thai Grill but when we arrived there the closed sign was up with a note saying \"Closed today Tuesday because the cooks are tired and need a break, will open tomorrow Wednesday\" Okaaayyy?? So of course we were disappointed, we sat in the parking lot a min or two trying to find another thai place close by, I really wanted some Tom Kha soup and Larb.. Anyways, we didn't find anything and I noticed KoMex was right down the street, so to KoMex we went! Thank god we did, this place was AMAZING. We did have to wait for about 10 min, they were packed, it was around 12:30, so it was lunch time. Once we got sat they came right over to get our drink order and then asked if we were ready to order, only except we didn't even have time to open the menu, so we asked for a few minutes.   We ended up ordering a half order of the Bulgogi Fries, a half order of the Chow Fettuccine with shrimp and 4 Bulgogi tacos. Everything was delish! My favorite was the Chow Fettuccine, so good. The only thing I didn't really like was on the Bulgogi fries, there was WAAAYYY too much cheese... if they would have put half of the cheese on that they did, they would have been better. Ill definitely be going back multiple times to try EVERYTHING on the menu.  Im giving 5 stars for the food and price. As far as service goes, it was eh, they seemed too busy to give proper service, and it doesn't help that the dining space is small and all the tables are a little cramped. The only other thing I would change is their hours, they definitely need to be open late, its the perfect place for drunk food.",

Pork belly = Meat and Fat Hot pork belly fat is heaven on the roof of your mouth. After it cools and congeals a bit it heads south in taste and texture. That's how the fat part was in my taco. Had to spit out a few nuggets.  The meat part was like marinated jerky bits. Very chewy though flavorful.    Probably won't be back. Mainly because I'm from Hawaii and there are a lot of places I'd like to try in Vegas so you gotta hit hard on your first try for me to come back.   Oh and there's nothing free w Yelp checkin.",

    "text": "KoMex is one of the few places that I felt deserved a review from me soon after enjoying the amazing food and service.  KoMex is a definitive reason for why YOU should rent a car when visiting Las Vegas and leave the overpriced Strip for amazing food and service.  I was in Vegas with a group of 12.  We rolled in and without batting an eye, the server smiled at us and seated us quickly.  Her service was attentive and always with a friendly smile and great attitude (even though we were a loud group).  On to the food!  The highlights of the menu:  1) Bulgogi Fusion Taco - So I have had plenty of Korean Tacos, some good and some I threw away right away.  This one was good for one simple reason, it came from a Korean cook.  The bulgogi and slaw were legit and the flavors were amazing!  2) Calamari Taco - I will admit, I am a huge sucker for sauces.  Cruising through the menu, I originally was going to get the shrimp taco but saw \"special sauce\" in the description for the calamari taco and knew I had to get it... and I was not disappointed at all.  The calamari was crisp but not burnt with soft texture and squid flavor beneath the batter.  The sauce was really damn good and enhanced the calamari with a sweet spiciness.  A must try!  3) Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Bulgogi - Honestly... do I need to say more?  The kicker of this dish is the fried egg with runny yolk combined with the kimchi.... DROOOLLLL.  4) Bulgogi Fries - Cheese. Pico de Gallo. Chips. Kimchi.  Bulgogi.  Fries.  Oh man, the combination of flavors, spiciness, coolness, fries, and other amazingness makes this dish sooo coma-inducingly good.  Try please, for the sake of you future children.  Oh, and the service, again, is AMAZING!  Get in a car and try this place now!",

Some hit and miss experiences but overall good.  To have this many reviews and maintain this high of a rating you gotta be doing something right.   They just need to get their kitchen in order for how popular they are.",

All great but i give the Gold to the burrito - great stuff, reasonable prices - this place is worthy of expansion to the rest of the valley !",

    "text": "i normally just do check in quick reviews, but the fact that this place had so many high reviews made me feel as though i must log on and speak the truth. the problem with yelp is that no two people have the same taste in food. i think my tastes are much more refined than say, the people who go ahead and give mc donald's 2 or even 3 stars. i LOVE food. and i am willing to spend money on a satisfying meal with good service. that being said, i am starting to believe that when a place like this gets such high reviews, it is the quality of the taste of the reviewers that is lacking. i made reservations for 8pm and arrived at around 745. we were seated rather immediately, then proceeded to wait and be COMPLETELY ignored for about 20 minutes. this was a busy friday evening, and there were TWO servers, obviously not enough for this establishment, since not one could even spare a second to stop by the table and at least give a friendly greeting. other tables were enjoying their free chips, salsa, and guac while we sat with an empty table waiting.  eventually i got up and asked a waitress if we could have some water.  then more time went by while we continued to be ignored. FINALLY a waitress came over and said, \"what would you like?\" at which point we ordered, and i said, \"and do we get free chips and salsa?\" she said yes, and after taking our order ran off again. this is a tiny place so i could see everything that was going on, and as the minutes continued to tick by, every time i saw her pull up a plastic basket i hoped it was for our chips and salsa, but alas, it wasn't, time and time again. AGAIN, i finally asked the other waitress if we could get our free chips and salsa, and it was brought. at this point others were sitting around us, and being treated in the same manner. i felt embarrassed for them and bad, that they were sitting, staring around, waiting for someone to just ask them what they wanted to drink as we had done moments before.  when the food finally came, i was excited because i had read so many incredibly positive reviews that i really expected a taste sensation. i was so disappointed. main word to describe what i tasted would be BLAND.  the only thing i enjoyed was the fish taco, which was really good, but i think that was mainly because of the sour cream, for which i am a sucker. i also got fusion lettuce wrap and fusion tostada, both with chicken, and both pretty damn boring. i think the deal with this food is that if you don't like spicy and don't get it with spicy sauce then you don't get flavor. this is me, unfortunately. that being said, my boyfriend got the fusion burrito and absolutely loved it, as well as the pork sliders, which i must also admit were delicious.  however i was so offended by the service it took the rating down so many notches, and then the food being so bland just solidified a two star rating.  i suppose the only reason it's not at a one star is because the prices were INCREDIBLY cheap, but, again, cheap food isn't worth it to me if what i'm getting amounts to crap. frankly i would have gotten more bang for my buck at taco bell.",

Food i ordered and tried was bulgogi, chicken and pork tacos. my favorite was the bulgogi my least favorite was the pork. the flavor of the tacos were good just wished the tortilla was a little bigger. I also tried the bulgogi french fries. the fries were ok...its just basically soggy fries, cheese and bulgogi. and then korean sauce poured all over it. i definitely wouldnt get them again. i dont think id drive to komex unless i was close to it. if i did the only thing id order again is the tacos.",

I had the bulgogi fries which was probably the best tasting thing we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi fusion burrito which was okay tasting too but was still missing something. My sister orders the bulgogi plate which was just bland. It was just bulgogi & rice which I could have made at home. I asked for a side of kimchi & the portion was so small. It was literally a spoon full of Kim chi which also didnt taste very good. Besides the food tasting just okay the customer service was not great. Idk if it was because they were busy or what but when I called to order for pick up the guy on the phone seemed irritated & was rushing me. Whatever the deal is & even if its busy your customer service should always be on point. Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.",

Bring these together is just a good idea on paper. Let's put it this way the place is busy busy but no Mexican and no Korean customers. If you think kimchi is the only thing Korean food has to offer go to a bone fide eatery. It doesn't take a genius to replace ground beef in Mexican dishes with bulgogi and voila...fusion. Shortly they do both cuisines rather mediocre so the combination falls short of any greatness. The only saving grace is they give you a lot of food. If you're smart you'll catch on quick to the \"just add kimchi\" trick to every dish the owners had in mind. They have Mexican food in the back part of the menu as if an afterthought.  Go yelp Thai or Pho restaurants in the area If you have a craving for Asian food.  Want good authentic Mexican cuisine look elsewhere. If you just want to be curious and say you've been here then its your time and money to lose. Synergy has not been achieved. Experiment failed!",

    "text": "The food was ok. The Korean element is very heavy in the flavor of te tacos. I ordered one calamari and two pork belly tacos. The food  has a hint of sweetness that is very different from any other Mexican joint in town. The specialty food is defiantly  one of a kind, however, being one of a kind is not always a compliment, and in the case of Komex it does not really add any level of satisfaction to the original.  The only reason I am writing this review is because the service I received was stupid. I ordered three tacos to go and was told that it would be a fifteen minute wait, no biggie, I took a walk for the fifteen minutes and then returned to the restaurant.  [this is what mad me decide to no longer go to this establishment] I walk in and am greeted by the same person that took my order no more than fifteen minutes ago, he asks me if I will be having my food to go or dining in, I do not understand how someone can forget a customer so quick, as if I never even came in. I t was not until I told him that I was just in there to pick up my order that I just placed, that her remembered who I was. Well he then proceeded to piss me the hell off, he gave my tacos away to some other customer. He must smoke an otherworldly amount of pot because  he forgot me on a slow night at that. He then apologized and said that my tacos will be remade. My tacos were done in approximately 7-8 minutes.   In conclusion, I will never go to Komex again, not just because the service is shit, but because the food is overpriced and is not very good.  sorry komex dude, I just had to tell it like it is.

    "text": "On a whim I decided to try this place because yelp tagged it as vegetarian friendly. First of all, my GPS was unable to find this place, and kept making my destination somewhere on Yale St. which is in the super ghetto. Finally, I came to my senses and just read the address and decided it would be right off Decatur...which it is. So even though its located in the vicinity of the ghetto, its on the main drag so its easy to find.  After using Yelp for a while, I find its most helpful in finding \"Diamond in the rough\" restaurants that you would never have gone to if it had not been for some random review that really got you excited about some random type of food. The best experiences ive had are at some hole in the wall places that have great service and great food. If this is the experience you are looking for, then KoMex is certainly up your alley.  For a while, i've actually wanted to go to China Poblano (Asian Mexican Fusion) in the Cosmopolitan. Even though it is massively overpriced, everyone says its worth it because the entire idea of an asian mexican fusion place is just so entirely ground breaking. Even some random food network talking head said so. While reading the reviews of China Poblano, I find the same sentiment. \"Its not that great food wise, but wow! what a great idea!\"  KoMex, I believe, is everything China Poblano should have been. KoMex is cheap, innovative, and, most importantly, the food is great! I got the Vegetarian fusion stir-fry burrito and I can't stop thinking about when I can somehow work in another trip to North Decatur to get it again.  KoMex Fusion Express is definitely a keeper.",

I also ordered an order of Pork Belly musubi which was tasty, but not a great deal for $6.  Tacos are an excellent price for $2 each.  I will try this place again.  The staff was really helpful and explained everything when I said this was my first time eating Korean tacos.  They also have a straight up Mexican menu, but I like Asian so I decided to give it a go.   Two thumbs up.",

I split it with my women. yeah I know.. i'm fat enough 4) they busted out with free chips, salsa, and guaco dip.   say whaaaa  then came out the asian sliced orange all from a hole in the wall.

    "text": "I love LA's Kogi truck and have been going through withdrawals looking for something comparable in Las Vegas.  Well, that search is finally over because KoMex's fusion tacos has filled that void.  And it's even better because it isn't on wheels and it is much cheaper. My husband and I ordered the beef, pork, and chicken fusion tacos and they were surprisingly very filling because the corn tortilla was exploding with marinated meat goodness.    I also ordered the fusion bulgogi burrito and upon first bite, it reminded me of late drunken nights and midnight runs to Jose Bernstein's in Westwood.  Although KoMex serves the kimchi on the side instead of inside the burrito like I am used to- it was a burst of  flavors that melded so perfectly well.  Who knew that Mexican rice, bulgogi, cilantro, onions, pico de gallo, lettuce, and asian sauce nestled inside a flour tortilla would be a match made in heaven.    The wait for our food was quite long (but at least we had a basket of chips and salsa to avert the grumpiness induced by hunger pains).  We placed our order \"to-go\", but we learned our lesson and will call in our order in advance next time...and there will DEFINITELY be a next time. Besides, I must try the chinese food on the menu too!",

The bulogi meat is perfectly marinated and has such an awesome flavor- you can go wrong ordering it in the taco, burrito, nachos... just pile it on high! The bulogi tacos: loaded with the marinated Korean meat, super fresh and delicious. Just squeeze some lime over it and the flavors speak for themselves. Two tacos is a pretty good portion- espcially if you plan on ordering the nachos too.  Bulogi nachos: everything nachos could be and beyond. The chips were thick enough to withstand the meat and the thick mozzarella cheese, but they were still super crispy and very addictive. The bulogi meat paired perfectly with the hot sauce in a way that you'll be licking your fingers clean. My only complaint is that the mozzarella cheese gets cold too fast- however I think that's a common problem with all nachos Cheesesteak: my husband order this monster of a sandwich- you almost need a fork and a knife to enjoy it. The bulogi meat has a more subtle flavor in this dish, but it works well for the cheesestake sandwich. The fries were a little bland and not my favorite- but who cares with all the other knock out dishes.  To quench your thirst- try their passion iced tea. Perfect on a hot Vegas summer day",

I was going to pack the left overs for the plane ride home!   We went with a party of 9 so we made reservations- we heard it gets busy for dinner. The place was filled when we got there so good thing we did. You need to try the bulgogi nachos, the tacos and fried rice!!! There are different types of meats that you can get so have your party order different ones so you can try them all!! Service was EXCELLENT, our waitress (the owner) was very attentive and the food came out fast!  Hope they open one in Hawaii!!",

    "text": "Alright this place is a definite regular go to for me and my companions for primarily two reasons 1) food is deeeelicious 2) prices are super duper reasonable.   First, after you order, you get complimentary chips with salsa and guac, which is already hard to not like. Also, while, I haven't tried everything on their menu--recently, they added more to their repertoire including pork belly spam musubi, which was really really tasty. The pork belly was just the right amount of stomach fat (sorry if that sounds unappetizing) and meat, and cooked so that it was slightly crispy on the edges, but still able to melt in your mouth alongside a bite full of rice and seaweed. Other than that, my go to's are usually the fusion tacos, or fusion---anything and I usually get the spicy pork. The bulgogi is good, but it's a little to sweet for me, so I opt for the pork, which is just the right amount of heat. Also, another fave of mine to add onto everything is their homemade chili sauce thing? I'm not sure what it is? But it has bits of, what looks like, kimchi and chili paste and it hits the spot every time!   The only critique I have is.....they don't serve alcohol LOL. Not that I'm an avid drinker, but sometimes it'd be nice to have an ice cold beer while eating my Korean-Mexican fusion tacos.   Lastly...if you, like myself, drink water/non-sugary drinks like a camel, I recommend ordering regular ice tea. It's less than $2, I think, and the glass is way huger with unlimited refills...and for some reason they refill these faster!",

They specialize in Korean/Mexican fusion and you really can't go wrong with anything \"fusion\" on the menu.  I am a huge fan of their tacos, especially the pork belly. They are pretty small, but they are loaded with delicious meat and cheap. I am also seriously addicted to their chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa has a little kick and great tomato flavor and the chips are homemade! YUM! My husband is partial to the fusion burrito, which is both delicious and filling. We have also tried the fusion cheesesteak with fries and it is out of this world delicious! It is super cheesy and of course the bulgogi is so flavorful. The fries are disappointing but that may be because they are usually cold by the time we get them home. We recently tried the fusion wings and my husband loved the flavor, but they definitely have a bit of a kick. The only thing that I have had that I was not into was the Chow Fettuccine. It was actually much better reheated the next day, but I just wasn't a fan of the flavors and it was a tiny bit greasy. Other than that one dish everything we have tried has been outstanding! If you are looking for something different and delicious you should definitely give it a try!",

The staff was very friendly, so much so that their customers greeted me as I walked in. My first time there, but I already felt like a regular. I was so hungry, and I wanted to eat fast.

We started with their yummy chips, guacamole, and salsa.   It seems like I always start my meal off with 2 bulgogi tacos. This time around I also order their Fusion Chimichanga, also with bulgogi. The tacos are always great and never disappoint. The chimichanga was really good, covered with red enchilada sauce and some pico, spot on.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients was really good, never tasted too much of anything.   Good tasting food at an awesome price, will be back.",

We ordered fusion tacos, fusion burrito, fusion quesadilla and fried rice bulgogi. The best was the burrito - it was stellar! I would have skipped the quesadilla - in such a place I rather fill my tummy with better things than molten cheese! Service was extremely nice.",

They have a decent sized menu here with Korean food, Chinese food, Mexican, Korean, and of course the fusion. They even have burgers on the menu which my 5 year old son enjoyed.  Thank you Yelp! I would not have found this place if not for this site. I'm surprised to see anything below 4 stars for this place, but I guess people have different tastes. If you typically like Mexican and Asian cuisines I would recommend this highly. Try something from the fusion menu - it is fantastic!",

This is a unique, non-fast food original cuisine that is well worth the experience. I will definitely be a repeat customer.    In my opinion their prices were too low. They should move to China Town, increase their prices 20% and will still double their business.",

We were able to snag a small table by the door and it took a little while for them to come take our order.  We ordered the Bulgogi Nacho's, which were absolutely amazing.  They were so flavorful and we were able to demolish the whole plate quickly.  I liked their homemade chips and guacamole as well.  Next came out our Daejiogoi Burrito with fried Kimchi, which we ended up taking to go since we were so full from the chips (burrito was good, but I will try it with bulgogi next time and without salsa).  I was also pleased with the egg Musubi and chicken taco.  The price and flavors cannot be beat!  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!",

I got the bulgogi torta and my wife got spicy pork, and im still shocked at how much food we got for only 12 dollars.   bottom line go here if you cant decide on what you want to eat because they have everything and its guarenteed cheaper and better than anything youve had",

We had to wait a bit to be seated, but we didn't care after tasting what we had waited for.  My table and I went crazy for Bulgogi since this is what you should do when trying Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American fusion (phew!)  We ordered the Bulgogi fusion tacos, the Bulgogi fusion burrito, and the Bulgogi fries.  After seeing pictures of those fries and living in San Diego for years where carne asada fries are like crack, I couldn't resist.  Everything was delicious!  The tacos were cheap and had great flavor.  We ordered kimchi on the side which was a nice accompaniment.  The burrito used similar ingredients but could definitely fill you for days.  The fries came out on a huge plate and we could barely make a dent in them, although we did try our best.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  Plus, she didn't stare in disgust as we sat before this mountain of food, which was much appreciated.  I will definitely be back Komex, but next time I think I will venture onto the Asian side of the menu.",

The majority of Yelpers legitimately gave this place 5 stars for several reasons. Freshly made food that is full of flavor, huge portions, cheap prices, great quality ingredients, friendly service, and not your average food items. All of these factors more than make up for location and decor. I revisited this little gem during lunch & had the chicken bulgogi tacos with a side of Mexican rice. The corn tortilla tacos were overly stuffed with juicy, flavorful chicken, marinated cabbage, & I got kimchee on top. What an explosion of goodness it was. The rice was pretty good, moist and better than average. Lunch came to just over 6.00 total for 3 tacos, side of rice, & a can of soda. Nothing to squawk at. By the way, as everybody mentioned, free homemade chips with salsa & guacamole, little cute orange dessert & fortune cookie, ALL included!!  Its not often that you can find a place like this.

The food was good.  Not over salted or too greasy.  Excellent fusion tacos, we had the beef and pork.  Both my kids liked their tacos.  Enjoyed the Kimchi fried rice with eggs, portion large enough to feed a family of four.  Excellent combination of flavors and spices.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a little while now.  So when we had visitors in town that wanted some Mexican food, I thought what a perfect time to come check out this place. Although it really is off the beaten path for me, it was worth the trip to experience what Korean Mexican fusion was really all about.  The waiter brought out complimentary homemade chips with guac and salsa dip to start our night out.  We ordered the bulgogi burrito and kimchi fried rice and our friends had their fusion tacos.  Both dishes were quite good and fulfilling.  The portion size is huge and the ingredients inside were very fresh.  Although the bulgogi could have been more flavourful, their special house sauce and other hot sauce condiments really made the burrito stand out.  I really enjoyed this fusion restaurant, but because it is so far away from me, I think I will only be coming here if I am in the neighborhood for some other reason.  I took one star off because I had to ask the waitress for a knife to cut the huge burrito and extra plates so we can share our dishes.",

    "text": "What.  Are Vegas Yelpers so used to crappy restaurants, this one seems terrific in comparison?    My H and I landed at North Las Vegas airport at about 2:00 PM and were real hungry and thirsty, so we Yelped something nearby. Wow 4.5 stars so we made a bee-line to KoMex.   One thing that attracted us to KoMex was, a Yelper wrote that you get chips and salsa. Not so fast, turbo.  You get your chips AFTER you order. So if it takes them a while to take your order, too bad, you get to wait.   After I ordered my Bulgogi Plate and Gary his Chimichanga, our chips and salsa arrived with tiny plastic cups of salsa and guacamole.  The chips are more like fried wonton. Fine, ok but no big deal.   I ordered iced tea and Gary ordered a Diet Pepsi. My tea arrived with no offer of sweeteners.  I dug into mu purse stash of sweet n low. Gary's drink was in a bottle. Really?  No fountain?  Sigh. I hate that. Did you guys know that fountain formula is different from bottle?  Very different. Bottle is full of phosphoric acid.   Our food was fine. My spicy pork Bulgogi was not unlike I've had in other Korean restaurants. Gary liked his chimichanga and ate it all, but he didn't do two huzzas and a backflip.   I had to ask for refills. The place is a little grungy and painted a mint-bile green.  An employee sat behind the service area eating a cucumber like a banana. The benches are wood but their backs are upholstered. The floor is dirty.   I'd go back but overall, I'd say KoMex is only OK.",

    "text": "Here's the thing:  I liked the food at KoMex and thought that all of the food was solid.  I'm just a little confused at the overwhelming amount of support that comes off of the Yelp-o-sphere at how amazing this place is.  I mean, it's good, but is it really earth shattering like so many Yelpers make it out to be?  Perhaps it's because I'm a resident of LA - the undisputed progenitor of Korean/Messican fusion food - that I've become somewhat blase to the whole scene...  for reference, your humble author cut his proverbial teeth on Jose Bernstein's Kimchi Burrito in 1996, a full 10 years prior to the inception of Kogi tacos.  Anyway, since Corazon and I had an early dinner reservation at the exxxcellent Lotus of Siam, we split a couple of tacos (bulgogi and pork belly) and a half order of the bulgogi fries.  As I said, the food was reasonably priced and everything was tasty.  I was surprised that they actually had table service at this restaurant, but all of the wait staff were friendly and approachable.  I am almost 100% certain that they are all close friends or family members of the owners.  In summary, it's always great to see local restaurants succeed and it seems like KoMex is on their way up after reading signs of future franchise options.  Despite not being blown away by the food like many other Yelpers, I was pleased with the quality and price and I hope continued success in their future endeavors.",

For one, despite the very affordable meal, you get the sitdown restaurant treatment, menus and tables and all, when they could easily have made us fall in line food-court style for the quality they're delivering for the price-point. Even just the crisps they serve you when you first are seated are generous, considering your bill will likely over around $4-$7 per person by the end of it.  The service is very friendly, warm, but efficient, which makes this very busy and small establishment more cozy than hectic. That was unexpected, too.  More unexpected was the fact that I actually liked their tacos - the seafood was very good, not quite fantastic, but definitely good. The textures could have stood to be more sharp and firm, but it did make for a pretty nice cohesive taco. It was a little bit on the harsh side, with the combination of strong spices and strong citrus, but it's a nice tasteful kick instead of being outright offensive. Besides the tacos, the bulgogi fries were very, very good too, and the water was ice cold and frequently filled.   I'm not a taco person by any means, but these are tacos I'll definitely eat, especially at a bargain like this, and with such a cute, welcoming, clean, but very casual set-up like this. Definitely very different.",

Service was friendly, but they really could have used more help.  The waitress seemed a little frantic and it seemed like several people were at all times trying to get her attention.  The food was as good as the first time I'd eaten there and the price still can't be beat.  Got 3 tacos and a Voss water and it was roughly 6-7 bucks total.   From my standpoint and from what I've had, the tacos are definitely the way to go still.   Choose your three meats and make sure you have the condiments at your table and go to town.     Maybe their new location will help the overcrowding and MINOR service issues which are the only things keeping this last visit from being a 5 star experience.",

And being so close to San Francisco's Mission District and San Jose's East Side, I was blessed with some of the best Mexican food in the United States, so of course my palette tends to be a bit critical when it comes to Mexican dishes.  That said, this place was actually really good! We were seated promptly and during out stay we were approached twice and asked if everything was fine. Now that's pretty awesome customer service.   My friend ordered the fusion flautas and I ordered the bulgogi burrito. I had a flauta and it was delicious. Very crunchy and flavorful. My burrito was pretty big and it was really good but I felt that it was missing sour cream. I mean, who the hell eats their burrito without \"crema mexicana\" or failing that, normal sour cream? Not a bad overall burrito but definitely not game changing and not amongst the best I've had. But again, my standards are ridiculously high.  They ended the service with orange slices and fortune cookies. Which was a nice touch. And over all the meal ended up being less than $20 for the two of us. Score!  I'll definitely be back. Maybe next time I'll get some of those flautas or try something else on their really yummy looking menu.",

We are seated and I immediately let our server know that I have checked in through Yelp to redeem my check in offer of free wontons. YUM! The wontons and complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole were my favorite parts of the meal.  My fella and I ordered the Bulgogi fries and a fusion burrito to share. My fella was really not feeling the food at all. He left feeling very disappointed. I found the food interesting but the concept not fully realized. The flavor profiles seem great together, but the execution was lacking the flavor I was hoping for. Their food seemed to lack flavor a little, almost bland. There were so many sauces and salsas to put on top of everything it didn't really help as much to round out the flavors as I would have hoped. The Korean meats were tasty but not the greatest quality or cut and it showed. Just too gristly. I know the price is right, but I'm not certain that the quantity over quality fared well today. I added Kimchi to my burrito for more flavor, it helped a bit, but something was still lacking. I like the Korean and Mexican fusion concept, but there was not enough of either to really give it a kick.  I had high expectations of this place, maybe too high. I still want to give the place another try, since the menu was definitely interesting, well-priced and the service was excellent! I'm just not totally won over after my first visit.",

We start off with the fusion bulgogi fries, half order, which is plenty big.  We have beef, mozzarella cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeno and Korean hot sauce all piled high on top of the fries.  Oh so very good!   These flavors smothered with the fries, well you just have to try them.    I  also get a fusion burrito, beef, Korean BBQ style, with Mexican rice, green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce, with soy and sesame sauce, all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  It's big in size and flavor. It was excellent.    The food is so good, the mix of both asian and Mexican styles never thought it would be good, but it was surprising how the flavors just work together.  Now I know this is a go too place when craving spice and a bit of \"komex\".",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW!  What an experience here?  I was finally in the vicinity of Komex so I took that family to try out this place. I told them I was going to Dairy Queen....  Yeah right, who would go to DQ for frozen foods that are reheated.....  1.  Why here?  Have no idea why this place is located on the north side of the 95 and Durango in a small strip mall however, it is very crowded.  2.  Groups - Most of the tables are wide enough to squeeze in five not so huge people, and they have two areas where seating for about 6 is very comfortable. However, possibly about 40 people can be in this place so it time your visit well.  3.  Food - Absolutely creative and amazing. If you are fond of Korean food, this is really cool.  Tofu Taco with Kim Chee - Nice tasting, flavorful and a bit of spice.  Bulgogi Taco - If you like the spicy salty sweet taste of Bulgogi, in a taco it really is nice.  I really liked all the kim chee on it, the chili paste, and the small round taco that is perfect to hold and eat.  KimChee Fried Rice - This is a truly great dish. I am a BimBimBap person myself, and so this was a unique dish full of flavor and very red overall due to the Kim Chee.  We brought some home as leftovers. It was great.  Bulgogi Slider Burger - My  son had this and he really liked it. He was quiet for a while as he scarfed this down.  Mongolian Beef with Rice - Could not decide if this was better tasting than the Kim Chee Fried Rice.  Teriyaki Chicken - Yeah, I know yet I have young ones and well, they like the more traditional stuff.  They do like Bulgogi and Kalbi and all the meats, however, sometimes you gotta get the Macaroni Cheese of Asian food... It was good.  Port Won Ton Fried - 8 per serving. Tasty and what a good deal.   4.  Price - What an inexpensive place. Very nice on the budget.  5.  Soda's a great variety of drinks all seemingly purchased at Costo and sold. You can pick it yourself out of the fridge and they will add it to your bill.  I did ask for water, and they take bottled water out of the fridge and so, I did not check my bill to see if this was paid or free.  I prefer fountain soda in larger cups however, I was here for the food.  I like this place and will try it again for sure.  I think, that I am a real lover of the traditional Korean Style food, and I do like this place overall.  GK says, if you are in the neighborhood, check it out.",

    "text": "I reallllly wanted to like this place :( I came here with the expectation of tasting tacos like the Kogi truck and bulgogi chimichangas like Cha Cha Chili-flavored food (both LA-based Korean-Mexican eateries), but man were we disappointed. The only thing that was spectacular was the attentive customer service, but that's where it ends :( The free guac and chips were nice, but their chips are the super-hard thick kind of chips. I ordered the bulgogi chips/fries combo, and neither tasted good. Pork belly taco was okay. The flavors in my bulgogi chimichanga didn't complement each other at all. I tried mentally convincing myself to like the food, but I just couldn't.   Maybe if this was my first time trying Korean-mexican food, I would enjoy this place. Komex has a lot of fans, so they must be doing something right! It just didn't jive with my taste buds. The waiter and waittress were very attentive here, though!",

I loved that they used flour tortillas for their flautas and chips. Make sure to get the sauce tray because they have a house mix of salsas that are wonderful. The guac that came with the flautas was mixed with a Korean sweet sauce which was awesome and gave a little extra flavor to the food. You can tell everything is super fresh and hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.",

Good, meat was tender, it's a strange combo I'm used to carne fries so the sweet meat was not what I'm used too. Needs sour cream and guacamole . It was good. Not sure if I will order it again. Also ordered the pork belly musubi and that was so good and tasty my fave. Hubby ordered the tacoa chicken and pork. He liked the chicken the pork was too sweet. Love how they serve the hot sauce on little containers. Also that you not only get chips and salsa but guacamole too. Be prepared to wait, the sign says they make everything fresh so it takes awhile. Oh and they sell Mexican sodas too not only come but Pepsi etc.",

Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly and only cost $25 for everything!! We even had leftovers!   Free chips with guac and salsa(which is made daily in-house). That guac had to have been my favorite ever! And I eat a lot of guac.

I mean the portions were huge. I would get this plate again ONLY because if you pour a little Korean sauce on it it tastes delicious!  My BF had a taste of the Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Fish tacos- loaded with tasty toppings and only ($1.29 each) not bad. The final verdict was PORK tacos, YUM. The fish taco was tasty but they put sour cream when it might have tasted better with a creative fish sauce or \"KoMex fusion\" sauce of some sort- just sayin...   MUST TRY the BULGogi Nacho Fries- OMG soooo goood!   While you're waiting they give you a side of chips, salsa, and guacamole and no tap water for these peeps- it's bottled water all the way baby!  The restaurant itself is small and it seemed super busy during the lunch hour. The service was mediocre but the waitress was friendly and helpful for us first time customers :)",

    "text": "I had heard and read about this place for months before finally stopping in for a quick dinner with friends last night. The hype is strong and that kind of anticipation can often lead to dissapointment. Not this meal.  We arrived seperately so two of us were seated and I quickly chose to try a both a bugogi beef and spicy pork fusion taco as an appetizer and get an idea of what I REALLY wanted to order. Both tacos were fantastic...Everything a great taco should be- fresh, doubled up tortillas, a generous pertion of meat and garnished wonderfully with some fresh pico, cilantro a few strands of cris cabbage and limes. Also there was a slight tang of vinegar like acidity at the end I loved.   When I saw the Fusion Fries on the menu my eyes burned laser holes thru that section of the menu, only question was which of these well prepared meats would I choose. Being a risk taker by nature I inquired about the possibility of both meats but was denied by a level headed chef who probably knew better. I went with the beef and was not dissapointed. My only reservation with this dish was the fact that the shoestring fries were no match for the mountain of goodness blanketed lovingly over them. Might go with the nachos next time which my friends ordered and were anchored by the same sturdy homeade tortilla chips that were presented to us free of charge on arrival. Delicious.  Service was very good, especially considering we had people staggering into our table at different times and seperate checks. Extremely humble spot, but clean and comfortable.  I was on the fence between 4 and 5 stars but the prices are ridiculously low and the fact that they're bringing something different that is also family run AND homeade to a part of town that needs it? Home run.",

First off the rice was fluffy, bland  and not flavored as Mexican rice.  The beans also did not seem to have much flavor and was a bit on the dry side.  The chips and salsa they give you while you wait  though was excellent.   It was very fresh and tasty.  I just think I was expecting the fusion to be a lot more Mexican tasting.    Next time I think I'll will try the Korean side of this restaurant. since the prices here are great.",

    "text": "I am a picky eater and very very American when it comes to my food so a good review from me to KoMex you might find hard to believe but I did.   Well here it is, KoMex is delicious, yummy, flavorful, big portions and great prices. I was introduced a few months ago and have been there alot since finding out about this place. They are a small business with only about 10 tables in the restaurant and the owner will normally be your server. She is the nicest lady and works really hard at her job and her business.   This might sound strange but I always get the Mexican taco's (steak) and they are the best steak taco's I have ever had. KoMex makes them on those small corn shells and they are perfect. The taco's come in steak, chicken, pork, fish, and shrimp.  They start you off with freshly made tortilla chips and the guacamole is home made and my girlfriend loves it as she almost always eats it all up.   I feel as if I should mention some of there other menu items that my girl gets all the time, chicken teriyaki=great, Mongolian beef= unbelievably good and the pork taco she claims is better than the steak but I doubt that.   In the end, we get out of this place with a VERY full belly and still a fat wallet, well as fat as I had it to begin with the wallet that is.   So here's the deal, if you haven't been here before GO and GO now cause it's just delicious and coming from a picky eater that tough to say.        Your critic Vegas Villain",

I understand the service goes in hand with the food but the food is more important to me. I know these mom and pop places are struggling and it is a hard business to operate just to make a living--give them a break! They are working all the time. I know most of you don't work 80 hours plus a week on your feet. I surely don't and that is why I have respect for these hard working business owners.

    "text": "In my hometown, there's a food truck called Mogos which is Korean Mexican fusion.  Their burritos are delicious.  When my classmate told me about Komex, I was extremely excited because I don't go back to my hometown often enough to get my Korean Mexican fusion fix.  It's a really small, hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant maybe 6-7 tables at the most.  They don't serve fountain drinks, just bottled beverages. They have a variety of meals on the menu, and I ordered the bulgogi fries & the bulgogi burrito (for my lunch the next day).  The fries were no more than $10 and the burrito was no more than $7, and their portions were HUGE!  Considering how expensive bulgogi usually is, I didn't expect that much meat in my meals, but I am completely satisfied with the portion sizes.  As I mentioned before, I ordered the burrito for my lunch the next day.   I was a little hesitant about that because burritos are not usually good the next day, but I hadn't gone grocery shopping & needed a meal for my 12 hour shift, so I just decided to give it a go.  I'm glad I did, because it was perfectly fine the next day and I really enjoyed my lunch.    Not only was the food excellent, the service was as well.  I was greeted & served by an older lady (maybe the owner?) and she was very chipper and professional.  Even though the burritos come with pico de gallo, she always asked if I still wanted it inside the burrito or on the side.  I'm definitely coming back!",

They accommodated a large group on a really busy day with short notice.  5 stars for that.  Food that I ordered has been so-so.  I got the tacos with lettuce wraps - 2 pork, 1 chix.  Chix had no flavor, pork was good (not too greasy), but not excellent.  Others in our group ordered fried rice & thought it was really good.  I thought the fried rice portion was small.  Ingredients appeared fresh enough. For a busy day, I would say their service was almost excellent.  Yes, the food took some time, but they kept the tortilla chips & salsa bowls full.  Consistently checked on us inc drinks. Korean-Mexican food is no longer a new novelty.  Their flavors must either be excellent or menu must have something entirely different and interesting -- and flavorful.  I found neither.",

    "text": "We were really excited to try this place, mostly because Yelp seldom lets us down. Coming inside we were immediately welcomed and seated promptly. We must've gotten there right before afternoon lunch rush because at this point there were only a couple of others besides us. After taking a few minutes to digest the menu and make a decision, I went with the bulgogi burrito and my boyfriend the bulgogi sliders. We were then passed some chips, guacamole and salsa while we waited.  It took all of three minutes to bring out my burrito. I was elated. I took a couple bites expecting my boyfriend's food to come out shortly after.....nope. I set the burrito down to wait until his arrived. We waited sometime between 10-15 minutes later. My question is, if my burrito was going to take 30 seconds to cook, why not leave it until my boyfriend's is closer to finishing? Terrible timing. My appetite was nearly spoiled by the time his came, and I now had a cold burrito to look forward to.  The food was decent. It was our first time here, again, so experiencing the fusion was new to us. Bulgogi was good, nice flavor and texture. I don't know why they offer French fries with the sliders because they're plain jane, no salt, no nothing French fries that detract from the slider flavor. Omitting them entirely would be in their favor.  We may go back if we're in the area. No need to drive out of the way for it.",

Our party ordered bulgogi burritos, bulgogi tacos and chicken chow fun. All were amazing. The bulgogi burritos are a MUST! The bulgogi is cooked well and is complemented nicely with the sweet and hot sauce. Kristina ordered the bulgogi tacos and they were better than any bulgogi tacos that we've had. Make sure to try the bulgogi if you go. You won't regret it.  The biggest plus of this place is the PRICE! For 4 plates our dinner was under $30!!!!! Yeah, $30 big ones and we were all stuffed after. Totally worth the drive from the strip but be forewarned, this place is small. The staff is extremely friendly and kept checking up on us throughout our meal. 5 stars all around!",

First off, we showed up basically at closing and the owners let us dine in and were incredibly nice. This was exactly what I was looking for, a diamond in the rough. I love little joints that are tucked away that just blow your mind. This needs to be on Diners drive ins and dives. Guy would love this place!   We ordered a bulgogi burrito and quesadilla and pork tacos. The burrito was honestly hands down the best burrito I have ever had...ever. Everything about it was great the meat was well marinated and full of flavor. Tacos were intoxicating and same goes for the quesadilla. We could taste the passion within every bite of every dish. Its easy to see that they have a lot of pride within their food.   They are located in a little shopping center and could be easily missed if youre from out of town and dont have GPS. Inside is plain but decorated with newspaper and magazine articles notating KoMex's awesomeness. Honestly who cares about what this place looks like its all about the food here.   I recommend KoMex to anyone and everyone. Its only about 15 mins from the strip and worth it. I would drive any distance to get to Komex.   I want to thank the owner who I never got the name of for letting us eat right at closing. It was very nice meeting you and we enjoyed the conversation after our meal. PLEASE OPEN A KOMEX IN CALIFORNIA! If not we will be back soon! Any time im in vegas i am going to KoMex, new tradition.",

I ordered the fusion nachos, burrito, 3 tacos each with a different meat, a lettuce taco with kimchi and vegetarian noodle dish. Because I was traveling, sharing and heard it was cheap. My favorite was the burrito, then the nachos. It was all good but I didn't care for the noodles (just me). The only thing that bugged me was the waitress kept wiping sweat off her brow and I was hoping she was catching all of it. I hope someone recommends her to wear a sweat band like the tennis players do.",

But their menu & customer service were pleasantly surprising!   Boyfriend got the fusion torta with pork belly (which was extra) & I got the fusion chimichanga with bulgogi. Yum! My chimichanga was topped with their \"Komex Slaw\" which had tons of flavor & made the dish IMO. (Boyfriend got a side of it & put it right in his sandwich. He says if you get the torta, this is a must)   All in all, not a bad way to spend $20 & we'll definitely be coming back to try their other dishes!",

The chips - homemade, refried every other hour but they're not oily at all, I could eat them forever The tacos - they're fat, you definitely get your money's worth. The meat is tender, packed with flavor, these are great tacos. Wonton soup - It tastes somewhat different from your usual takeout wonton soup, has a Korean twist to the flavor of the broth. It's refreshing, wontons taste great. Kimchi Fried Rice - It's not fried, most likely done in a rice container. Still, it tastes amazing.  Bulgogi Sliders - The marinade for the beef is sweet, but not too sweet that you can't finish the dish. It's sweeter than what I'm used to, but these are definitely good to try out.  Server, who is also the owner, handles multiple tables flawlessly, doesn't mess up a single order. She keeps water filled, always makes sure we're enjoying everything she's served. Pleasant.",

    "text": "My friend and I were at Meadows Mall and wanted lunch but not familiar with the area. So I used my trusty Yelp app to find nearby restaurants and up popped this \"fusion\" place. I couldn't resist checking it out seeing how all of the Yelp reviews were 5-stars and people raved, so I had to try it.   This place is one of those drive-by-and-if-you-blink-you-miss-it joints. Located in a crowded strip mall - a little hole in the wall place and definitely a well kept Vegas secret. This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm serious. They give you nice crispy complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was really yummy. I ordered a fusion burrito with tofu yum yum yum YUM!!! it has tasty fresh ingredients, Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian Soy/Sesame base Sauce. Be warned though that it is enormous so either be really hungry or take the rest home like I did. It was delish the next day.   My friend had the fusion bulgogi (beef) tacos and she said they were amazing as well. I can't wait to come back and try the nachos!!!!!   They have that awesome bottled Mexican Pepsi and Mexican Coke, how cool is that? They also carry pineapple jarritos beverage. I drank unsweetened mango passionfruit iced tea and that was really different, very tasty.   Fast and friendly service. And this place is CHEAP!! My entire lunch bill was $8. We will be back!!",

The price isn't bad either. The flautas are what I always get but you can't go wrong with any of the fusion foods.

Besides Bulgogi is gold if done right.   The bulgogi fries: delicious and what you'd expect from marrying decent bulgogi with fries and bold fusion sauces. Can't say I've had anything like it. Bars should take notice because I'd describe this dish as the drunk person's best friend at 2 in the morning. But maybe the fries are too soggy to be sober. So it's like yummy bulgogi fusion-ness on mashed fries.  The bulgogi burrito was pretty great because we weren't expecting a Mexican burrito. We expected a KoMex bulgogi burrito. Whatever that is. It was so tasty I'd order it again. On the same note our friends raved about the bulgogi chimichanga and chicken bulgogi.   Not bad at all for being next to a gas station and such things. Oh, they serve free chips and salsa if anything. Yippee.",

So, I decided to stay and a friendly hostess showed me to my table.  I had the bulgogi, daeji and dak gogi tacos plus a side of bulgogi fries.  They were all flavorful.  The bulgogi fries can feed 2 very hungry peeps.  Imagine a pile of crispy golden fries topped with melted cheese, jalapenos, hot sauce and bulgogi...sweet, savory, spicy all in one. YUUUUMMMM!!!    My next visits, I tried the calamari tacos (tender calamari, lightly breaded) and my KoMex favorite: bulgogi chimichanga.  It's incredibly cheesy, crispy, meaty and tasty.  It may be a bit oily but it's alright.  Just thinking about it is making me hungry.  Great service, amazing food at very affordable prices.  You get chips, salsa and guac for free.  At the end of your meal, you get fortune cookies and sliced oranges speared with little plastic swords.  It's Korean, it's Mexican...it's KoMex!!!",

    "text": "Dear Komex,  I expected to love you. I wanted to love you. I just knew I would love you. However, something somewhere just fell short for me. I LIKED you but definitely did not LOVE you.  I had booked marked you as a place to visit many moons ago. So in the car on the drive over to your place of business I was like a little school girl on the first day of school - excited, nervous and anxious.   We pulled up and saw the long line outside the door and the place inside packed. (This just reaffirmed to me, how much I was going to love you.) Despite the long lines and how packed it was,  we were seated within 15 minutes.   The menu looked good. I didn't know what to get. I settled on a fusion calamari taco and a half order of bulgolgi nachos with a side of kimchi, bulgolgi fried rice and spam musubi.  We munched on warm tortilla chips with two small containers of salsa and guacamole (courtesy of your restaurant) while we waited for our food. My nachos came out first and I thought they were going to be topped with the kimchi but they were not. Instead, I received my kimchi about 5 minutes later.  Let's talk about your bulgolgi nachos for a bit. They LOOK good. However, upon dissection all it is a HUGE plate of chips with skimpy toppings. The toppings there do equate to good flavor and a yummy taste but the ratio of chips to meat and cheese is lacking. I was slightly pissed off because of the lack of bulgolgi on my nachos. It was like it was sprinkled on quickly as an after thought. If I am paying $6.00 for a half order of nachos, I expect just a little bit more. Why not layer your nachos so that you get yummy toppings throughout? Because after you eat the top layer, you are left with plain ole tortilla chips. How fun or good is that? Think about it, okay?  Kim chi. Is it jarred? And why is it chopped up so little? And kimchi should have some spicy heatness to it. This kimchi lacked in serious flavor. I swear it is jarred and I am thinking you might be able to get more flavor profile if you make your own. Think about it, okay?  The fusion calamari taco. It wasn't bad. I don't have much to pick on about it. I ate it all. However, I don't know what I expected in my head but fusion just made me think it would be so different. It was just two long pieces of deep fried calamari on a flour tortilla with some lettuce and toppings and fusion tartar sauce. I LIKED it, but didn't LOVE it.  Bulgogi  Fried Rice. You win in portion amount. Hands down. It is big just like the nachos. But when the first word is Bulgolgi, I expect more bulgolgi. I should have caught on when the waitress kept correcting me and calling it beef. I just thought she was being rude and didn't like the way I was saying it. The flavor profile in this fried rice is decent. I am a self proclaimed fried rice snob and I can honestly say I didn't have to add anything to it to make it taste better. I just needed more meat. I would gladly receive a smaller portion to get a bulgolgi fried rice. Think about it okay?  Spam Musubi. Oh yeah. This was your saving grace, I bit into this sucker and it was like the angels started singing to me. But spam and nori, what is not to love?  So Komex, what am I left with? Would I return? Yes. I did LIKE you. Will I rush back? No. You are bit too far and just need to make some improvements.   Sincerely,  Debra W.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm spoiled because i started eating Majority of my Korean favorites in Hawaii . Hawaii has awesome Korean food .With that being said i was not impressed . I have wanted to try for a long time . I'm glad i got it over with but i will probably not be returning everything was either OK or lacking flavor .   We arrived at around 530 and already had plans to go to the gym . So we took it to go . Since we wanted to try the meats we decided on a Bulgogi Burrito and a combo plate with chicken and Spicy pork . This way we get to try all three meats in one visit. I  have a weakness for Korean & Mexican food so this place was a no brainer for me .   The gentlemen who took our order was prompt to greet us and take our order . During our order I stated i wanted to have the lettuce and pico on the side since we were taking it home and eating it later . I thought the Bulgogi Burrito came with kimchee. More Korean flavor is awesome right ? Nope . In photos it shows it on the side of the burrito but i didn't get any . Thats fine . I can do without the kimchee . What i cant do without is flavorless meat . That's what we got .   Bulgogi Burrito - The wimpy burrito had rice and bulgogi or whats supposed to be bulgogi. People claiming there burritos were humongous . Not mine i could have got a bigger burrito at Roberto's . Maybe it was small because it didn't have lettuce or pico in it . Honestly who wants lettuce in a burrito if food is served warm the lettuce would become soggy . Not a good idea IMO . The meat was lacking flavor and the rice well mexcian rice is simple so nothing stand outish or special about this at all. I even put the sweet/spicy red sauce on the burrito and frankly that's the only thing that saved it . Not to mention my first bite was gristle . I hate gristle . Uhhhh ! Annoying !   Combo Plate - Chicken ans Spicy Pork Combo Plate , Sub white Rice for Spanish rice .   Chicken well it was just chicken not to much flavor just tasted like cut up sauteed chicken . Could use some salt thats how bland it was .   Spicy Pork  - Not even close ? Bland , boring , and weak .   Sauces - Theres a red one that has a weird vinegary taste . Not a fan   Sweet/Spicy Sauce - I actually liked the sweet/spicy sauce that has a sesame flavor , Actually i loved it . I would eat it on any food that i put hot sauce on .   Green Sauce - Standard green Sauce its aiiightt   Pico De Gallo - Needs more cilantro IMO it was ok . Pico doesnt need that much attention not even this was good .   Korean Slaw - Cabbage and cilantro slaw basically . Also boring . Tasteless and boring . I paid a dollar for this crap .   Just get this meal over with is all i can think about . Maybe the marinades need tweaking or marinade for longer . I don't know but they didn't win me over Komex fusion needs to fuse some flavor because Flavortown kicked them out upon arrival .",

    "text": "NEWS FLASH! THE HYPE IS REAL! I REPEAT, THE HYPE IS REAL!  %$#@!@#$%   Sorry, that was me banging my head repeatedly on my laptop keyboard because I am so mad at myself for not going to this place a lot sooner! I couldnt wait to get home to do this review and I hope my keyboard is gonna work long enough for me to finish this!  I ordered the Bulgogi Beef Burrito and my son ordered the Beef Bulgogi/Spicy Pork combo so we can share. OMG I couldnt make up my mind what to eat so me and my son split both meals.  The Burrito has the best of both Korean and Mexican worlds! Now I know why they named themselves that. This tasty choice has Meat with Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian (Soy/Sesame base Sauce).  Service is, let me put it this way, a little slow BUT before you jump to conclusions, you have to understand that they make everything from scratch and if a big party before you put their order in, then that is what is gonna go through first. That's understandable because if you ordered before somebody else, whether big or small, you should get it first right? With that said, I was a little irritated at first, but when my food came out and went straight to my mouth I was mad at myself for being irritated because the food is well worth the wait! I recommend that you don't be in a rush to go anywhere else if you plan on eating here and if you can order to go, that's even better because by the time you get there, it should be done.  With the popularity of this place blowing up, I see one of two things that might happen: Either they open up another place or move to a much BIGGER location or both. The demand is definitely gonna out do the supply sooner or later because on really busy nights you are definitely gonna have to wait a while to get a table.  Some random info: They are closed Mondays so make sure your cravings don't fall on that day! They have free wifi but I couldnt get my phone to work with it so maybe next time I will ask them. Parking can be a nightmare because they share the same small lot with other tenants. They take all major credit cards but be advised that anything under 10 bucks, you will be charged a service fee so as much as you can, pay with cash for all orders under 10 bucks. Its not Komex's fault. Its just that anytime you have a terminal for accepting cards, the company that processes it charges the business owner for every transaction. So you see its not a ploy for Komex to make more money. It's more like a convenience fee for not carrying cash.   They don't have a take home menu for the info you need but you can look it up through their website:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.komexexpress.com&s=efbc0d367d4dc5fd5b70bcf71de8e9a14c2dc44c7a9f2e6bf6249c2a01354d13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">komexexpress.com</a>   So with 350+ reviews averaging 4 1/2 stars, what more reasons do you need NOT to go here?",

I've always enjoyed the bulgogi burrito. The kimchi fried rice is just ok. The tater tots are way too much. Fried potatoes combined with cheese, bacon, bulgogi and pork belly=3 bites and you are done. Too much grease and fat. I might be making the case for some people on those.  If you go here, stick to the classics as those seem to be the best. Some of the fusion doesn't quite work.  Bulgogi burrito though= 5 stars",

    "text": "While driving to the SoBe Ice Arena in the northern part of Las Vegas, my travel companion eyed KoMex. Intrigued by the name, and the concept of a fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine, we stopped by for a quick noshing after completing our event at the rink.   There's not much going on in terms of decor or ambience in this little eatery, but those types of trivialities should be shelved; it's the food that is king at this local hotspot. KoMex has all the appearances of a neighborhood taco shop, but it really is a full service, sit-down restaurant.  Upon entry, it was refreshing to see a sign that loosely read, \"This is not fast food. Expect to wait a little longer for your meal.\"  And that was just fine with us.  We decided to share an order of the Bulgogi Nachos. In addition, I ordered one of their shrimp tacos, while my lunching companion selected the Spicy Pork Tostada. The nachos were delicious. The distinct flavor of the bulgogi integrated nicely with the classic Mexican nacho construction. I was quite impressed. My taco was also pretty darn good, packed full of shrimp (they don't skimp, thankfully) and flavored by a delicious white sauce. Needless to say, the somewhat grumpy disposition I had developed before walking into KoMex quickly subsided after the first few bites.   Final bill was around $17. A great bargain for the ton of food that we received.  Amazing concept. Flawless execution.  If I were a local, I fear KoMex would become one of my regular haunts.",

    "text": "\"hidden gem\" yada yada  Been here twice, not thouroughly impressed with the food, but I would come back since they have such a creative menu.  REVIEW OF FOOD: - bulgogi torta: came out a little soggy.  YUMMMM love damp bread... NOT. But bulgogi is awesome and so are tortas. Would have been better if they could somehow contain those juices better  - kimchi fried rice + bulgogi: freakin' LARGE serving. Almost too much rice to just have as your meal. One thing, there was def NOT ENOUGH bulgogi in the rice. I had to dig around to make sure I had proportionate rice to meat ratio per bite.  - bulgogi burrito: after the semi-disappointment with the torta, the burritio was next on my list to try. It was disappointingly bland!!  I had higher expectations but I guess I built myself up too much.  - chips + avocado and salsa are complimentary  - saw someone order what looked like a chicken and white rice plate...looked pretty tasty so that's something I'd consider trying next time.   - my friend could not stop raving about the calamari taco - said the calamari was cooked to perfection and crispy. Good enough to order another one, on top of the 2 other tacos and burrito she ordered.  Not overly thrilled with the food here, but I'd go again to try a few other things on the menu.",

Parking lot is small and packed, had to park behind building on a side street.  Ordered the Bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich and added tater tots for an additional $1.  The cheesesteak was delicious and packed with a good amount of meat.  The fusion aspect worked well with this type of sandwich!  I also like the complimentary chips & salsa that they give you.  A few other folks in my group got the Bulgogi chimichanga and Bulgogi quesadilla..they both looked delicious too!  Overall, for the most part, I think Komex lives up to the hype, and I would definitely go back again!",

I got chicken and tofu fusion tacos and I was not disappointed. The chicken was really tender and juicy, just how I like my chicken. It was full of flavors and has a small kick in different bites. The tofu taco is a good vegetarian recommendation and very filling for me. I actually like the tofu more since I'm not a meat person.   WILL BE COMING BACK TO TRY OTHER FOOD CHOICES!!",

    "text": "The Original KoMex Fusion! When you think of any kind of fusion it always creates plenty room for thought and taste. Mexican and Korean are in my top favorites of foods to eat so when you mix them together? You betcha I'm all here for it. I've been to both locations and I'd have to say the Flamingo/Buffalo location is my favorite.  My most recent experience was this past weekend while I was on this side of town for my nephews track meet. We all know track meets are like all day so my family and I decided we would take a break and grab some quick lunch. Since I'm not really on this side of town I had to pause for a little bit to think \"What is around here to eat\"? Pulled up Yelp and saw that KoMex was like 0.2 miles away and we were sold! The set up is kind of weird at this location in the matter of when you want to place a take out order. The amount of distance between the person sitting at the table behind you while ordering is so uncomfortable  Lunch order consisted of: Spam Masubi, 2 Bulgogi Sliders, Bulgogi Quesadilla,Chicken Fried Rice and KimChi Fried Rice. Everything was fantastic and I was glad to have shown my family another great place when your taste buds want two different types of foods at once! We will be back very soon.",

There was no sign or anything on the door that said why so we thought it shut down permanently and we were beyond sad. But recently we drove by and saw that it's open and in business again. PHEW!!! What a relief!!! We of course pulled in for dinner without hesitation. My husband got a fusion chimichanga that has some sort of sweet and spicy pork, rice and beans inside, topped with a slaw and lots of cheese, covered in some delicious red sauce. I ordered their kimchi fried rice with beef and a fried egg. (Pictures are attached). Both dishes were delicious and having free chips and salsa while we waited for our food was a huge plus. The gentleman that seems to be the only one working the front is very nice and attentive. The only reason why I took a star off is because the inside is pretty small and could use some upgrades. But other than that, we love their food here and would definitely come back more regularly.",

This time I asked the sales person let's go somewhere that I cannot get anywhere else but here in Las Vegas.   From the outside it looks intimidating, and upon walking in I still felt the same as the decor Isn't exactly lavish. However since my friend said that this place is going to be one of my favorite places to come to, I decided to try it.  I had the sliders, and they were absolutely delicious. The food there is well prepared and the owner I believe is super nice. My coworker is correct I will be back",

The food is made to order, but the wait isn't long at all.  It's a perfect place for cheese lovers, because a lot of the dishes are dripping with cheese that even I.. someone who doesn't eat dairy.. was drooling at the food.  I got the kimchi fried rice, which was amazing. We also got the perfectly toasted beef grilled cheese which was so gooey and delicious. It's a small drive from the strip, but worth the trip.",

Inside is a bit nicer now with some new chairs & tables, I think a newer TV too.  But thankfully the food is still the yummy same!  I would almost kill for that salsa/Korean hot sauce combo they use, hits all the right taste notes!  We got the Fusion Nachos with Chicken and the Fusion Quesadilla with Beef to share.  OMG - still delicious!  Nachos were full of seasoned, grilled chicken, lots of cheese & jalapenos, lots of pico, and lots of that Korean hot sauce!  Spicy & cheesy!  The quesadilla was just as good, nothing but bulgogi beef & a ton of cheese!  So enticing with the perfect crust on the tortilla from the grill!  Crisp on the outside but gooey on the inside!  No Korean drama here folks, just some damn fine eats!!",

Can't believe I live only five minutes away from this place! Everything was mouthwatering and caught me by surprise since other fusion places I've been only taste blaaaaand. But food here? They got all the rich flavors you've been craving. They also make their own four different styles of Korean-Mexican sauces, and they are DELICIOUS!! One is Siracha based, one is green chili based and one is a Korean sauce. Once you pour that red sauce onto your burrito, and bite into the beans, the beef, the pico, the onion and the rice. You're taken to a whole other world. The burrito itself is hefty huge. Every bite hits the spot! They also offer macaron ice cream sandwiches, can I just ask for anything better? Will definitely be back again. Additionally, the PRICE is cheap, SERVICE is fast and PORTIONS are great. KoMex you rock.",

KoMex is the real deal -- freaking fabulous Korean-and-Mexican-influenced food that is executed absolutely perfectly. The dishes themselves seem sooo standard (omg fried rice and nachos, how quaint) but that is seriously misleading. They will be the most amazing fried rice and nachos that will ever grace your unworthy tastebuds and there will be enough portioned on your plate to serve a medium-to-large family (pace yourself).  The location is vaguely sketch and sort of random, to the point that I drove by it three times searching for a likely storefront -- don't make this mistake, it *is* in that plaza that looks straight out of the Walking Dead.",

I'm not as high on it as some of the other Yelpers,  but I still put it pretty high on my list.  So what's actually pretty awesome about this place is that they have ZERO problem splitting checks for you. Unlike other places that say they will but give you this reluctant only-if-I-get-a-good-tip attitude, our server split up our party of 12 with NO problem. Go in, eat,  pay your bill, bounce. You don't have to sit there for 30 minutes trying to figure out what everyone ordered and how much they owe for tip.  Bulgogi Burrito ($7.50) Pretty huge burrito. I had to split because it was too big. The bulgogi portion is plenty, which is always nice. However, the taste of the bulgogi wasn't anything spectacular to me, just \"pretty good\".  The tacos were pretty popular at our table, so I'd definitely recommend getting that.",

I really love the infamous Kogi taco truck in L.A. and have tried to replicate the Korean fusion tacos at home to no avail.  Once we heard about this place, I knew we had to go immediately.  This mom and pop shop has modest decor, but is still comfortable.  A lot of that has to do with the wonderful service from the owners... I didn't catch her name, but one of the owners was so nice and honest!  Since it was our first visit there, we were going to order too much food - and she told us that it might be too much for us since their portions are big.  I really liked the sincerity - you would never find that anywhere else!  Anyway, we ordered a bunch of the bulgogi tacos and also the Korean style pork with rice.  This was more than enough food for two people.  The tacos were DELICIOUS and dare I say better than the Kogi truck.  The pork was awesome.  Period.  I'd eat that same meal over again anytime!  I also have to mention the complimentary chips and salsa (and guac!) for dine in.  Its tasty and free, can't go wrong!  I mentioned to the owner how much I love Chop Chae (this Korean noodle dish)... and although they didn't have it on their menu, she said that they could special cook it for us if we let her know in advance.  How nice!  Their menu is huge and includes the Korean fusion Mexican, regular Mexican, and Chinese dishes.  Their prices are outstanding... actually unbelievable in my opinion for the quality and taste of the food you get.  I think we ended up paying 12 bucks for the rice dish and 5 tacos.  12  bucks?!  Nice.  We are definitely going to make this a regular spot.  Looking forward to trying everything on their menu!",

We got the chicken, beef, and pork fusion tacos. We got the chicken in a lettuce wrap and the other two in a corn tortilla. We also ordered the bulgogi burrito. Everything was great. I preferred the tacos, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I'm not a big fan of rice in my burritos.  I plan to be a regular customer.",

When you walk in your expectations are not high, Michael Jackson's Thriller playing in background, older tv in corner with ESPN on...open kitchen with small seating area, typical of an older strip mall layout. You are greeted at door by cook and staff, and service starts as soon as you sit down, Chips with salsa and guacamole served with drinks. and food is prepared to order and fast. Many higher end restaurants could take a tip from these folks. We had Sliders with Korean BBQ meat and asian slaw, Masubi (spam, egg and rice roll) and Bulgogi nachos. All were delicious and would be considered high end tapas at double the price in a large trendy place. Serving sizes large, prices very reasonable for quality.",

    "text": "Wow.  We paid $9.13 for 2 meals, 2 cans of Coke Zero, complimentary housemade fried tortilla chips with guacamole & salsa, and complimentary oranges & fortune cookies for dessert.  It was so cheap, the service so nice, the staff just a mom/pop/daughter, and the food was so delicious that it made us feel bad...so we dropped a 20 dollar bill and let them keep the change.  I've only had Korean-Mexican fusion tacos done to perfection once before - at Coreanos in Austin, TX.  While a slightly different fusion mix, KoMex was definitely just as amazing.  I grew up on Mexican food (and cook it often fused with Vietnamese food), but I have to say that the sweetness in Korean marinades really works the best in fusion tacos.  We tried the special \"diablo\" chicken, spicy pork, and beef (bulgogi) fusion tacos, with kimchi included on the side.  The fillings for the $1.29 tacos are more on the Mexican side of things, while the fillings for the large burritos are more on the Korean side.  3 tacos is enough for a meal, as they certainly didn't skimp on the meat and fillings.  As for which I liked best, I'd have to say the spicy pork, which tasted very similar to the diablo chicken.   The tacos came with a sauce rack of 3 sauces (Mexican, Korean, Chinese) - all of them obviously housemade.  The \"Mexican\" sauce tasted a lot like the raw earthniess of freshly-ground New Mexican red chiles or similar, just like the sauce used at Mexican taquerias.  When dabbed onto the tacos, this raw earthiness just blended away and mixed into the sweetness of the meat.  The \"Korean\" sauce looked like your typical Korean hot bean paste, but one taste and I realized how much better it was than any brand I've had in a jar/bottle.  The \"Chinese\" sauce had chunks of garlic, chiles, and scallions in it, with a little bit of a soy sauce flavor in the base.  All were awesome - not being able to make up my mind, I spooned some on each bite, sometimes mixing 2 or 3 of them together.  Man, if I only had a Korean-Mex place as good as this in DC -- I'd seriously be there almost every day for lunch. I am salivating dreaming about it.  This place would also *clean up* in the Atlas District.  We told our waitress all about it and the ridiculousness of Toki Underground and its wait/overpriced ramen, who then relayed our stories to her parents in the kitchen.  People would eagerly pay $10 for these $3.87 plates of tacos, and wait 2 hours for it.  And then you could charge $8 for a cocktail on top of that.  C'mon, move out here -- there is a huge Korean community here in the 'burbs!  :)  Best food I had in Vegas (okay, so maybe Lotus of Siam was a tie - pun not intended) while I was there all last week.",

I searched yelp by check in offers because I was feeling cheap after losing all my money on the strip. KoMex came up, and we were sold. In fact, we waited in the parking lot for over an hour until they opened just so we could try it.   We over-ordered and everything was so inexpensive. I had the shrimp stir fry, my boyfriend had the bulgogi nachos, my friend had kimchi fried rice and they ordered a bulgogi burrito with kimchi as well. Everything I tried was amazing. I ordered a double order of kimchi on the side and greedilt gobbled it up in less than a minute.  The people working there were super nice and the food came out quickly. Plus, free wontons when you check in. Can't beat that!",

It was quite a distance(22+ mins) and in the hood, but was worthed. We were quite excited to see on the item of the week board \"4 tacos for $5, fusion/Mexican\".  This is a great deal to sample different tacos.   My friend, Patty, and I each got the - bulgogi: this taco reigned supreme by Patty and I.  Unique and delish. We put the Chinese hot sauce/salsa on this baby and got ourselves a flavorful and tantalizing heaping of greatness.  -asada: top this off with the Mexican salsa...good, but My taste bud could not forget the bulgogi - carnita: oh how the pork was kinda crispy...I forgot about the bulgogi taco for a nano-second -pollo:  I was full when I came to this taco. So I tried a piece of the chicken. Can't stack this up against the aforementioned three. Earl finished this taco for me.  We also tried the spam musubi. Portion was big. Was alright.   I had a taste of the bulgogi burrito and it was very yummy with the Kim chi in it. Like what every other yelpers have mentioned, the burrito is gianormous.  It has value written all over it.   Additionally, the Kim chi was super delicious.   There isn't much decor and the seats were not the most comfy seats, but after eating the food, I forgot about it.   We really wanted to try the pork taco on the fusion but they ran out of it. Boo. I was really excited to try that one too. Has to be for next time then.",

Been here about 3 times and have had not so great service every single time.  First time, made the mistake of coming during lunch time. Wait was about 45 minutes but luckily I had nothing planned after and was looking forward to trying a new place. After almost an hour we finally had a table. And after 30 minutes, finally got our food. It was very busy so I understand the wait. Second time, I called in my order since I only had 30 minutes for lunch. Said it would be ready in 20. Got there, still had to wait 20 minutes for my food. The order had not even been started yet. Third visit, came here today with my boss. Came around 1:30 after the lunch rush. They weren't very busy but we felt like they were rushing us to get out. There wasn't even anyone waiting for a table. So yeah, long story short...service is lacking. They have picked up on hiring extra staff which is good.  On the other hand, food is amazing!!!! The bulgogi burrito is my #1 choice. The mix of Korean and Mexican flavors all rolled into one is mind blowing!!! This is probably what unicorns eat since it's super amazing. If you're feeling like a health nut, they offer the same taste in a lettuce taco. Not really healthy if you eat 4 of them though. The portions are huge and the price is affordable! Since I'm close by, I will be back.",

Hidden in a small mini mall, I found food greatness! Today was my first time eating Komex Fusion and I will admit, it's the best taco I had in about 5 years. Yes...5 long years. Of course, I didn't just eat a taco...lol. The wontons-Spicy beef and pork, stuffed inside a wonton wrapper and deep fried, served with a spicy dipping sauce! The Bulgogi Fusion Burrito-Thinly sliced spiced beef, Mexican Rice, Green and Brown Onions, Pico de gallo, and Cheese, wrapped inside a fresh flour tortilla shell. The meat is seasoned to perfection, I really have no words, it's so good, it shut my mouth! Lastly, but not least, the Bulgogi Beef Tacos is it! Spicy Meat, cabbage slaw, melty cheese. They taste like it was marinated in Korean spices, then cooked on the flat top, creating little bites of crispy, tender, joys of beef!",

Barely noticeable from the street, I wonder if I would ever have run into this place if on my own!  Walking in, the lime green walls and \"older\" furniture left me wondering what kind of boyfriend I had and whether I should turn and run. Thank goodness I didn't! We were seated immediately and given drinks and fresh guac and salsa. The chips tasted freshly fried and delish!   I was weary about the fusion type. Can these two foods REALLY go together? Are my beans going to run into my kimchi and vice versa? I left my worrying aside as I ordered the fusion burrito. I chose chicken to be safe. The bf had bulgogi tacos. Our food arrived pretty quickly. My eyes grew huge when I saw my burrito! WTF?!?! The thing was gigantic!!! When I opened it up and started to eat I paused after the first bite. HOW DAMN DELICIOUS! The thing was too big to finish and I regretted having a big lunch before stopping here for dinner! haha! The marinated meat was better than I had at more expensive restaurants with nicer decor, etc. The tacos were great too. I just had to steal a bite. The meat was soft and cooked just right. Not overcooked or rubbery as we've had in other fast food places. The people working were so sweet and checked on us often.   Towards the end of our meal when I thought I could not fit in another bite, our server came up to us with half a sliced orange and two fortune cookies. It was a very sweet gesture. Free dessert AND a palate cleanser! ha! The perfect touch to a great dinner!",

Other reviewers talked about how there's a wait, but when I got there at around 2:30 (prime lunch hour) there were only two other parties there! I was seated promptly, given my beverage, a menu and complimentary tortilla chips, guacamole and pico de gallo.   I ordered the Bulgogi Nachos and wow, if I had known the servings were so huge I would've just had a half order! The prep for my food didn't take very long, maybe 10mins tops and it was delicious. The bulgogi in the nachos were generous and were strayed all over the top along with some pico de gallo and jalapenos. The bulgogi itself was marinated to a balanced sweet and saltiness that it almost made me want to order something else that had more of it.   The waitresses constantly refilled my water and were very nice. The price for my entire meal was very generous and the service was all together very pleasant.   Next time I will definitely be trying the other fusions on the menu (mmm pork belly tacos).   If you haven't had the chance to try fusion food made right I'd definitely recommend you pay a visit to this place! Just be sure to call ahead of time to reserve tables if you have a fairly large party, the place itself is very small and I could imagine it getting filled very quickly.",

We had the fusion tacos in all three flavors. My dad liked the Korean hot sauce cuz it's sweet. But I liked the Chinese hot sauce, so many layers of flavor.  The hostess was very sweet and amiable and the owner came out to talk to us and tell us about how Komex came to be and how they've been growing in large part thanks to Yelp.",

We ordered the chicken flautas, spicy bulgogi chimichanga, bulgogi enchiladas, quesadilla, and pork belly tacos. The pork belly tacos were the stand out. I would order that again, the rest, just ordinary for me. Not great korean food and not so great mexican food combined....just ok.",

He gave us some free guac because we told him it was our first time there.  I got the Fusion Burrito, which was surprisingly delicious, and my husband got the orange chicken.  The staff was really friendly and we talked with the owner about how she wants to open another location.  I had been itching to go back since then and we went last night.  Now, they had just opened up again after being on Christmas vacation, so I don't know if that is why it was so crazy in there,  but our second experience wasn't as good.  It was very crowded at 8:00 on a Wednesday night. My husband wanted the orange chicken again, but they had taken it off the menu.  He was really disappointed by that.  I ordered the carne de puerco. Unfortunately, the meat was cold and the rice and beans looked like they were from a can.  The owner was the only one waiting tables this time, so she was super frazzled.  I like this place and I like the lady who owns the restaurant, so I'll definitely be back, but my last visit definitely moved them down a few notches for me.",

When you enter the door the restaurant is plain, nothing over the top, just comfortable and intimate. We were seated and brought drinks and free chips and salsa with homemade guacamole. Who does that? How awesome! We then were told about the $5 special that was 3 bulgogi tacos and a drink. It's less than eating McDonalds, but quality food. I cannot say enough nice things about what we ate or the service. For the first time in my life after eating we ordered 2 more specials and a plate of fried rice to go to eat for dinner.

We place our order and proceed to have a great time talking with out table mates, and drooling over what they ordered. After a while our order arrived, steaming hot and excellent, I ordered the combo bulgogi (chicken & pork) WOW it had the perfect amount of spice (for me) and both the chicken and pork we moist and tender, my wife's fusion tacos were equally good,again the beef and chicken were moist, tender, a perfectly cooked. After we said good bye to the very kind couple, the owner came out (she took our order) and asked how our meal was, and apologized for the wait, to which myself and my wife told her not to apologize at all everything was wonderful and that we had an amazing time. Overall the experience was outstanding, the food excellent the price point spot on and to the couple that let us sit with them THANK YOU!",

Woooo-Wooo....book a nonstop flight and do the same....SO worth it!!!

I myself, am I big fan of the Mexican taquitos, lettuce wraps, fusion tacos (try their pork belly fusion tacos!) and the bulgogi fried rice. Everyone is incredibly nice and it keeps me coming back!

The chef came out and confirmed that there were no eggs in the fried rice... so I dug in. It was delicious. so flavorful. and exploding w. kimchi!!   I also got the free fried wontons for the check in special on yelp. The owner returned to inform me that the wontons were sealed w/ egg yolk. This just showed me how attentive she was! thumbs up to that.   Boyfriend got the soft tacos in pork, chicken, and beef. The chicken taco was delicious!! It had different dressings than that of a tacoshop ie cabbage.   I was really skept about trying this restaurant when my boyfriend suggested it. But it completely opened my mind to fusion food. I've had other fusion foods in San Diego which did not compared!! Will definitely be going back! I love it when hole in the wall restaurants blow you away like this one (:",

For our meal we both got wontons and I got beef, pork and chicken tacos. We split a beef tostada. While the chicken and pork were both good, the beef is the star here. And it was fantastic on the fusion tostada. The tostada has great, fresh toppings but instead of a corn or flour tortilla it came on something made out of rice. and the whole rice grains were still visible. I think any trip here should include a fusion tostada. Janet tried a tofu taco since her husband is a pescetarian and she said it was quite good too.  The only misfire for me was the mango/passionfruit iced tea. I don't get the flavors. Janet got one too and said she liked it. Service was excellent. They were really hustling. We got there just before the lunch rush. I would love to come back to KoMex and explore the menu.",

When we sat down, we were given chips with delicious guacamole and salsa. While the chips were made from flour tortillas, I preferred it because they were light and crispy. We asked for water and they gave us (free) Kirkland water bottles! YES! I am a water connoisseur and this place is handing out perfectly purified bottled water to accompany our meal.   I ordered the bulgogi burrito while my husband had a  bulgogi and pork taco. When my burrito came out, my jaw dropped. You know how Chipotle isn't known for amazing food, but rather the size of their mediocre burritos? This place would blow Chipotle's baby burritos away, and it was only $4.50!!! The bulgogi was marinated deliciously and was accompanied by pico, rice, lettuce, and kimchi. Honestly, when I eat KBBQ, I usually don't even get bulgogi because I'd rather eat Galbi, but this bulgogi in my burrito was amazingly tender and flavorful. 5 star worthy right there.  Then the super nice owner/waitress brings out the oranges that you'd get at a sushi joint with some fortune cookies and a lollipop for my daughter. Our total: $7.57. I am SO impressed with this place and will tell everybody I know to support them so that they can expand to somewhere closer to my house. Until then, I will happily make the drive.",

    "text": "Short: Surprisingly great fusion place. Reasonable prices, great flavor, in an older part of town.  Long: Came here with a friend. Ordered three tacos with the three types of meat (there are more, for extra). Came with cabbage slaw and some \"salsa\" on top (not spicy, but wouldn't call it pico-de-gallo). Afterward, was served chips with salsa and guacamole (kinda watered down, though).  Food was great. All the meats had strong flavor, the slaw on top contrasted with them nicely. I think I liked the beef best (forgot which one was which). What really surprised me was the side-sauces that were a real treat for someone like me. Nice touch. You do pay a small premium though. $2 for each taco is a bit much when they're not full sized, as you can get around the same size in other places for $1.25/75.   Come here if you want to try a different spin on mexican food. There's better places out there, but not as unique as this one.",

    "text": "Great hidden spot in Las Vegas!  I come from a Korean and Mexican background so this place was perfect for me.  The Bulgogi, marinated beef, burrito is a all time great and is an automatic go to dish for around $5 and can usually feed you for two meals.  Another recommended item is the Daegi bulgogi, spicy pork, french fries.    For those of you that have hit Robertos Tacos late night and enjoyed their super carne asada fries you will love these.  They step it up every week with new specials such as calamari tacos and bulgogi gyros so you never get bored with the menu.  The Korean street tacos blend the tastyness of Korean meats with the ease  of tacos, I recommend ordering a few at the low price of $1.29.  I could go on forever on the best items on the menu so head over and decide for yourself.  If you have friends that aren't too adventurous or little kids Komex can handle that too.  They offer sliders, french fries and other basics that are just as good.  Because this place is so good and really affordable it can get busy around peak times so don't get frustrated and recognize that if there are tons of people eating there then it must be good.",

WEIRD... i dont know\"... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.  THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner.   The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol  All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!",

My personal favorite is the Bulgogi (Beef) Tostada. They use a crispy rice cake to host a slaw and meat. It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.

After reading on yelp, I made the suggestion for lunch on a Friday.  We arrived just before the lunch rush and seating four people was not a problem.    After looking at the menu and knowing that I already love bulgogi, I went with two bulgogi tacos and shared a large portion of bulgogi fries.  Absolutely delicious!  Forks were parring each other to grab the next delicious bite.  When all was said and done all that was left was empty plates.  I was so geeked out on Komex, when I happened to be on that side of town, I took the Boy to enjoy the deliciousness this tiny, little Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant had to offer.  Who knew that one would have to wait for a lunch table on a Saturday!?  But we did even though waiting on a Saturday just plain SUCKS because I wanted the Boy to experience Korean marinated tastiness.  So we both ordered a fusion  burrito with bulgogi, mine also had fried kimchi.  We then did a half order of bulgogi ( I love that word) fries.  The ingredients are SUPER fresh, so fresh I felt myself getting a buzz with every bite. When dining on super affordable meal, don't forget to grab a hot sauce rack.",

I didn't even realize it was Korean/Mexican fusion until I opened my menu.  The restaurant is small and was very busy.  Five of us were seated almost immediately, drink order taken shortly after and a basket of homemade chips, guacamole and salsa delivered shortly after.  I shared kimchee fried rice, fusion style flautas, tacos, and spam musubies.  The flautas were my favorite.  Everyone left full and happy.   Decided to come back two days later before heading home and decided on the Bulgogi tater tots.  I requested a fried egg on top and was happy I did.  It complimented my meal perfectly.  It was like breakfast all in one (tater tots, bulgogi, sour cream, cheese, and a fried egg by request) I highly recommend this restaurant.  Food is great, service is good and will definitely come back when in Vegas.",

I had the bulgogi tater tots. The came out sizzling in a cast iron pan. The tots were topped with beef bulgogi, pork belly, and bacon. On top of that was tomatoes, green onions, and sour cream.

However, the meat didn't have much flavor. Eating it with the white rice didn't help the cause either. They do sprinkle sesame seeds on top. It gives it a little color and some lively texture but that's about it. Not oily at all which is a plus.  Their tacos come loaded with your selected main ingredient and pico de gallo. You'd think two measly little tacos wouldn't fill you up but it surprisingly gets you pretty satisfied.   KoMex does the trick when you're craving for some Korean Mexican fusion food in Vegas. However, I might think twice the next time and hold off my cravings until I go to LA.",

We asked for more guac and they just gave us some! Free guac is the greatest thing in life, I swear.  Service was great and food was bomb. I can't wait until they open up their newest location near my house! I'll go there all the time.",

    "text": "Where have I been during this KoMex kraze? Eating tacos and bulgogi elsewhere, I guess. It just didn't occur to me that I could've had both if only I visited KoMex, but better late than never, right?  The numerous close-up photos of Fusion Bulgogi Nachos alone are enough persuasion to visit. Unfortunately, my first visit was also my last.  I ordered the fish taco and Fusion Bulgogi Taco, and my friend ordered the Fusion Bulgogi Enchilada. We also requested a half order bowl of Fusion Bulgogi Nachos to share. Our waitress was kind enough to warn us that the full order might be too much, so we went with the half instead. She's right. The chips are enough to share with four people. Then again it all depends on everyone's hunger levels.  Our waitress started us off with a complimentary basket of hot homemade tortilla chips with side of guacamole and salsa. Very delicious and not greasy. They're thick and resemble pita chips. A fantastic start to our meal. So far so good.  We both were expecting our nachos to arrive first to tide us over as we waited for the arrival of our entrees -- we had both fasted for this visit and were really hungry! -- but that didn't happen. Instead, my friend's enchiladas arrived first followed by a short awkward period of waiting for my tacos and our order of nachos to come. Our entrees arrived warm instead hot, so that made us wonder if the food had been sitting out for a while before being delivered to our table.   My fish tacos weren't bad, but they're certainly not the best I've had. Here's what I like about their fish tacos:  - The fish isn't tiny and it's lightly fried. - It isn't slathered with thick specialty sauces.  The bulgogi tacos were tasty, and I enjoyed the sweet flavor of the bulgogi meat. I would've preferred a flour tortilla over the corn with this taco.   Fusion Bulgogi Nachos is a mountain a tortilla chips topped with mozzarella cheese, bulgogi, jalapenos, and a spicy sauce. Although delicious, when it arrived the cheese had cooled down and began to harden.   The meal was going well until I noticed my friend doing something unusual. At first I thought she was playing with a string of melted cheese that was hanging from one of the chips, but she was actually trying to move something. She pointed out a small black bug crawling on our table near our chips. We both thought it was a gnat but it didn't fly away. It couldn't had been a spider because it had  antennae and didn't crawl on eight legs. Rather than guessing what it was and where it came from, we stopped in the middle of our meals, paid the bill, and left with nauseating feelings in our bellies.  The cheap and decent eats would've brought me back for another try, but I don't think I can stomach the idea of returning.",

The guacamole is top 3 I've ever eaten, in any setting.   Do yourself a favor and order the hot kimchi   Go. Now. Take all your friends. If they are anything like my friends they will thank you mightily, then start going themselves, and send you photos, so you can jealously drool from hundreds of miles away.   The foodies are happy. The give me all the calories for very few dollars folks are happy.  The vegans are happy.  The spicy food lovers are happy.  The I can't handle spicy food folks are happy.  The food adventurous are happy.  The if I don't know that word I'm not eating it eaters are happy.   Fast service. Great joy. Too far from Colorado.",

I was too full to eat the tacos but y daughter ate them and said they were \"smack\" which in teenager terms apparently means \"great, delicious, etc\".

What a world.  The bulgogi beef Asian fusion tacos or burritos are the most popular things to order here. But if you ask, the owners favorite is the spicy pork. I went with the spicy pork burrito. It's always best to take the chef's lead. I wasnt sorry. It was a flavor bomb packed with all sorts of goodness. I could recite the ingredients for you, but it would bore you to tears. Just know its delicious and you should eat it. Don't forget the selection of hot sauces. There are four to choose from and not a bad one in the bunch.  It's a small place with a real mom and pop feel. They still give you table service so you don't have to order at the counter like a savage. Parking is a little tight, but you'll manage.  They've had a fair amount of attention from press and television. You know why? It's good. Go check it out.",

    "text": "It's been a bit so let's go!  3 simple criteria: Service, ambiance, and FOOD!!!  Service: Not gonna lie there wasn't much business in the timeframe that I went but it was fast and friendly and that's really all you need. The server that we had seemed to be running the front end by himself but he directed us where to sit and quickly gave us menus and asked for our drink order. He didn't miss a beat and we received all our food with not too long of a wait.  Ambiance: Nothing stood out in all honesty. You could definitely feel a mom and pop shop vibe and I don't know about you but I always like that. It wasn't flashy and it gave me a comfortable feeling. There seemed to be original art on the walls with cute characters.  Food: Alright so here's the best part as always. So I went with some family members and we ordered Spam musubi, spam fried rice, bulgogi rice bowl, mini quesadillas, and bulgogi nachos. Spam musubi and the mini quesadillas were for my nephew. He is a picky eater but he ate every bite didn't complain or ask for something different. That's already a win for me. The spam fried rice was seasoned well no complaints there. Bulgogi rice bowl came with other than the obvious... Coleslaw, baby greens, kimchi, jalapenos, and a sunny side egg. Be aware the photo looks smaller than the portion. It was way more than I could eat. The bulgogi nachos took me away though. I loved the flavors! I was always able to get a bit of everything in each bite. I loved the food and the prices are not bad at all for the amount they give you.  My only thing would be that they put cilantro in the bulgogi rice bowl and the bulgogi nachos. I'm not of fan of cilantro at all if I'm being entirely honest. The nachos I didn't mind but I did taste it in the rice bowl. I definitely should have asked and will do so next time just a bit unexpected in the bowl. Will definitely come again!!",

I tried all of the fusion seafood tacos and my buddies had the cheesesteak, fusion burrito and quesadilla.  All highly recommended.  Service was fantastic.  Keep in mind, the food is all made to order, so it is not fast food.  It's well worth the wait (10 mins or so).  I'm definitely bringing my family back to KoMex!",

I pass it all the time and keep meaning to stop in, I just always forget! I'm so mad at myself because I could have been eating their delicious food months ago.  Service was great, despite only one man working up front. We got our food promptly and drinks never got empty. The pricing of the food was amazing, cheap and huge portions!   Now the food. OMG! It's pretty hole in the wall, but the food is amazing. I had a beef bulgogi burrito and every element of it was amazing, as are their hot sauces too! My cousin got the bulgogi grilled cheese and she loved it. The menu has me wanting to try everything, so I'll definitely be back soon!",

The loaded fries are my favorite combining cheesy and that sweet and spicy Korean sauce... so good! There's always police in here eating and you know they know where all the good restaurants are. Takes about 15 minutes to get your food. Two huge thumbs up one of the best places in Vegas!",

The burrito was pretty good, although there was more lettuce than I prefer. I actually prefer beans and rice and salsa.. but overall it had a good taste and not overly salty which I was concerned it may be, but it was just right. The nachos were good and I really liked the pork bulgogi. It added a hint of sweet to the saltiness and paired well as a fusion Korean/Mexican dish. I came on a Saturday at 7:45p not realizing  they close at 8p so keep that in mind! But they were still helpful and accommodating!",

Our favorite are   ~Fusion Tater Tots $9  Beef Bulgogi, Bacon and Pork Belly + Mixed Cheeses, Topped with Sour Cream, Tomatoes n Green Onions.  And  ~Fusion Grilled Cheese Sandwich $6  They were both tasty and filling.Their home made salsas and sauce were fantastic.   We also tried their Fusion Wings and Pan Fried Fish which were ok. Anything with Bulgogi rocks!! and that's what I'll be ordering next time I come here.  The waitress was friendly and attentive. It's a great place to eat and doesn't break the bank.",

I literally had to try everything they ate on the featured video. I have to agree, GREAT HANGOVER FOOD! Decently size portion and prices for what you get!   I tried the following:  +  1/2NACHO- 1/2FRY COMBO with Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Korean Hot Sauce = was nice to start of with something crunchy and spicy. A great appetizer to share with your friends. I would get this again.   + Bulgogi Tater Tots = Tater tots with cheese, bulgogi, sour cream, pork belly, bacon, and tomato. It is golden, perfect, and just the perfect amount of crunch.  + Fusion Chimichanga with Beef = with Mexican Rice and Cheese inside. That is topped with Enchilada Sauce, Cheese, KoMex Slaw and Pico de Gallo. IS TO DIE FOR! I could eat this over and over again!  + KimChi Fried Rice with Spam with Sunnyside up Egg on top = I love the kick of spice. but it's not too spicy. You cannot go wrong with this.",

The interior has the feel of your grandma's kitchen with old laminate flooring and vinyl table covers. For the age of the space it's clean, but don't expect an overwhelming dining experience. What makes this place so n great though are the people. The extremely friendly staff members are fantastic. The food is pretty rockin' too. Being vegetarian limits me on my selections, so i was unable to try any of the fusion dishes. I did, however, have the cheese enchilada plate and for 5 bucks got three enchiladas, and heaping stacks of rice and beans. These were not the best or the worst enchiladas I had ever munched, but at 5 bucks they were an incredible deal and yummy. They also give chips, salsa and guacamole when you dine in and a cut up orange for desert. Overall, an interesting and cheap place that I'm sure would have been stellar if I still ate meat. In the words of Arnold, I'll be back!!",

When you are seated, they give you chips and salsa/guacamole.  You can tell the chips are homemade, and not store bought.  I ordered the Bulgogi Burrito and Fusion taco with green tea.  The taco was very tasty.  The meat is sweet and combined well with the coolness of the slaw.  They have their own Kimchee salsa that goes very well with it.  The Burrito was Huge.  I always finish my food, but I could only eat 1/2 the burrito.  Again, the meat was sweet and mixed well with the spanish rice and Kimchee salsa.  The entire bill was only $8.50!  The burrito was under $5, the taco was $1.35 (or something like that).  Well worth the price and well worth the trip.  The owner was extremely nice and the service was great.  Try it if you are in that part of town.",

I got the pork and it had awesome flavor (in tortilla).  She got chicken in lettuce and it was a little bland but I added some of the red chili paste and it was great.  They served us chips and salsa and the salsa was pretty good too.  The chips were crispy and soggy at the same time.  Some people like this, I don't really as they are chewy.  The fried wontons were good also, but not as good as being in Korea and getting yakimando.  The bulgogi was HUGE and AWESOME.  The total bill was 20 bucks and we took more than 1/2 home.  I asked Linda if the wonton was like yaki and she picked up that I had been to Korea before and offered some kimchi.  She said it's not on the menu but it is there if you want it.  It was good and you could tell it had some bubbly fermentation to it.",

I have found a new 'favorite spot' and already have plans to go back! I can't say enough good things about the food, DELICIOUS just doesn't  cover it. The service is great. I was so surprised when they placed freshly made tortilla chips on the table with a tastey guacamole and salsa. I could have made of meal of that alone. The Fusion Burrito I ordered was large enough for two, we shared a plate of the fried rice and still had to take some home. If you like the idea of trying something NEW give them a try, DON'T stick to the familiar, Let yourself go with it. The Fusion Tacos are a must , and if you like spicey just SAY SO. Plan to wait if you go in durring busy days, Fridays Saturdays and Sundays of course. Week days and week nights you can get seated sooner. But ANYTIME you go you will be delighted with the food and the service.  Leo G.",

Sure they have chinese horoscope placemats and trays of sauces but without the name, this could be any type of restaurant.  Back to the theme, looks can be deceiving and they are.  What Komex lacks in decor, this Korean/Mexican Fusion restaurant delivers in taste.  After reading so many positives and receiving recommendations from a friend, we stopped there late last night and had ourselves a 32 dollar feast.  We ordered Bulgogi Fried Rice, Bulgogi Nachos and Won Ton Soup and two drinks.    ADVICE - PORTIONS ARE BIG so either split a plate or go just for an entree.  We took a ton of food home.  The fried rice was excellent.  The beef tasted great and the spice was just right.  The wonton soup also packed a lot of flavor.  The nachos were enjoyable and filled with lots of different items unlike some nachos in other establishments where you have to hunt to find the meat.     The price is right, the food is delish, the staff friendly and even accomodated a 15 person party despite having few open seats left.  Its on the rotation!",

Sodas are canned or bottled so if you're used to having 5 drinks at a restaurant (like me) you're gonna end up spending more on sodas than your entree! I recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from the strip & just relax & enjoy a meal.

I called to place an order for pick-up for dinner for the bf and I.  The staff member I talked to was really friendly and helped me when I told her I had never been there before and wasn't sure about portions and what not.  I settled on the bulgogi burrito, chicken tostada, and pork belly taco since it was a special that week.  The chicken tostada was AMAZING.  It was so good.  I love that the tostada is actually made out of rice and it has this deliciously crunchy sear on the outside of the rice patty.  I'm definitely hooked on that.  The pork belly taco was super tasty too.  I had a bite of the bf's burrito; it was huge and delicious.  Just a note, the hot sauce they give you is legit. That stuff was super spicy, so I'd use it sparingly!  The food was amazing and I'll definitely make the drive to go back.  My car did smell like onions/garlic/food the whole next day and I did notice the same fragrance inside the small restaurant and it lingered on me even though I was inside for only 5 minutes to pick up the food, but that was about the only negative I could think of.  Amazing dinner for two people for $13? I'm sold.",

Their menu is a little confusing with a lot of items sounding very similar to each other so the yelp photos helped.   We ordered half orders of the Fushion Bulgogi fries &Chicken Teriyaki but their portions were very substainly sized. I ordered three tacos for myself - Shrimp, fried Calamari, and Pork Belly. I really liked the shrimp and the pork belly tacos... the Calamari taco tasted like a fish taco. Not bad, just not chewy and squidy like I'd expected.  The Bulgogi fries were deliucious! Perfect hang over food - wish I'd paid attention and requested no jalapenos but just ended up picking them off.  I really liked the guacamole that comes with their chips - if I wasn't heading out of town, I would have ordered the 1lb to-go side they offer of it.",

BUT, since I considered myself open-minded and I'm easily swayed by many, MANY good reviews from friends and yelpers, I became more excited to try this place. I mean, come on - bulgogi in a burrito with kimchi? That sounds pretty tasty! Besides, I love Seoul Food. =)  KoMex isn't too big, but luckily they had a booth that accommodated me and my 5 other friends. There were 3 guys and 3 gals. The guys and myself each ordered a burrito, while the girls ordered tacos. We also ordered some fried wontons (4 for a buck!)  I was clearly very hungry and thought I might be able to finish my food. I didn't stand a chance. I ate about 2/3 of the burrito, a couple of chips and guac, a wonton and waved a white flag.   The wontons are ok, but for a $1, definitely not disappointed. The burrito was SO GOOD! There was a good amount of meat and if you get kimchi (which I suggest you do if you like it), the burrito is just HUGE! I want to say it was the size of my forearm. Considering I'm petite in the sense that I'm short with short limbs, I think that's a pretty accurate description.  Everyone left stuffed and happy. If you are in the area and want to try some off the strip joints, you should stop on by.",

The tacos are amazing and even better if you order them as a lettuce wraps. Pork belly, fish, and bulgogi beef were all great though the calamari ones are a bit lackluster IMHO.

I had the pleasure of eating Kogi at Coachella last year.  So, I was thrilled that a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant was here in Vegas. So, after driving forever, we arrived. The first thing I was greeted with was \"we are closed and we didn't lock the doors. But if you order now, you can take it to go.\" Thanks to everyone's reviews I knew what to order.  The bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. The fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it. The meat didn't have the marinated flavor everyone talked about. The bulgogi burrito had a lot of rice and beans, lots of filler. The highlight was the spam musubi. The spam was fried and crispy.   So my experience could be just bad because we got there at closing. I would have rather left than paid for ok food and received the impression I was inconveniencing the owners.",

I will say the food was good, but not mind blowing spectacular with every bite..  I ordered the bulgogi chimichanga, my husband ordered the burrito version and we split bulgogi fries. The Korean sauce was tasty, the meat was tasty. The fries themselves seemed like frozen fries, nothing that great. I also expected more cheese on the fries.. (Shredded, wasn't all melted). The food definitely had flavor I just get the feeling what I experienced wasn't as good as this place used to be (from reading other older reviews). Could use just a tad bit more. some of the food was a little bit/ almost on the dry side. I would love to give it a try again but not sure if we will since it's on the opposite side of town for us.",

It's suppose to be a spicy sauce, but there was no hint of spice.  When I think of Mexican and Korean food, I think of spicy & this was none of that.   My friend had the bulgolgi cheesesteak and she said it was alright, but also claimed that it was sweet.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place, it's nothing near to Mexican or Korean when the flavor of everything was just sweet and nothing else.",

As always, the food was delish! I also had to sample the Spam Musubi with egg which looked like a Flintstone's portion where the nori could barely hold everything together, spam was perfect, the rice was kissed with a little shoyu and sesame love, and another KoMex item worth attacking....Mahalo once again Lynda, Brittany, and Chef/Sherriff Sonny!(yup, the KoMex mascot is Sonny;)......Also, as Misti Y. requested, they're also perfecting a tofu fusion taco, and for those of you living in the Southwest area, keep your fingers crossed...expansion plans are in the works by year's end where they plan to serve just the fusion stuff...ALOHA!!!

We still come here quite often,but  do notice they really need another wait staff since they are always busy.

I heard about this place and was...unsure...but after my brother in law went, and absolutely raved about it, I figured I would give it a try.   All I can say is WOW. We were in a party of four, and ordered a few appetizers, and we all kind of communally taste tested our meals. I didn't have a single thing that wasn't fabulous.   The restaurant itself didn't look like much but this place delivered, and it delivered big. It's pretty far away from where I live, otherwise I'd eat here every week. I've been back numerous times, and referred plenty of people. Of all of the \"fusion\" food places out there, I haven't found one that beats KoMex.",

First of all, the food is amazing and the prices are ridiculous. We fed 4 of us to our max for under $20 dollars. WHAT!  When you walk in to this non-assuming restaurant you are quickly greeted by the staff. This is a family owned place and you can tell they really appreciate your business...which I LOVE. We were given the yummiest free chips and salsa and GUACAMOLE! Yeah, I said it...complimentary GUACAMOLE. Who does that?? It was awesome. I almost cried I was so happy.  We tried everything...LOL..Ok, well we had one of each of the fusion tacos (only $1.29 each - very good investment, return is amazing!) We also shared a burrito that was the size of my face...and I have a big head. It was sooo good. They also finish your meal with a complimentary orange already pre-sliced....Love that too.  The only downer now is that every time I go to a Mexican place I am looking for the Korean meats. I am forever ruined.  Price plus great food and great service earns this place in my top eats. I see Mo-Mex in Ko-Mex in my future. (translation - I will be eating here again)",

The taste is what left me baffled. Everything was very mild and lacked seasoning.   I ordered kimchi fried rice with beef and egg, half order. The rice is basically lightly fried Mexican rice with a few tiny bits of beef and green onions. Oily and flavorless. And beef- where is it? Fried egg was the biggest disappointment- it was dry and over fried and no yolk to break :( I picked all kimchi out- most flavorful part of meal, and left the rest.  Kid ordered mini quesadilla- huge and enough for adult, served with pico de gallo and chopped lettuce. Another ordered three mini cheeseburgers- again, huge portion with fries. The beef patty was nice, but fries could not have been blander, and not a fan of American cheese topping the burger.   Bulgogi tots- another dry and under seasoned number. The one thing my party raved about was spam musibi with egg. You actually get two huge pieces in your order.   All in all- definitely a meh experience. Great service, reasonable prices and huge portions. Just wish the taste delivered.",

    "text": "I'm torn. I had high expectations for obvious reasons - rave reviews and an average of 4.5 stars - and who doesn't appreciate a good fusion menu? I want to believe that those expectations caused my less-than-awesome experience, but nevertheless, I wasn't impressed.  My friend (who is a big fan) and I shared a half order of Bulgogi Nachos, Fusion Flautas, Fusion Tamal with Bulgogi, and full order of Kimchee Fried Rice with Pork. I've heard the buzz around these fusion nachos, so I was most excited to try them. The Bulgogi: tasty, but a rather sweet marinade; nothing spectacular as Korean marinated beef goes. The chips were okay. I like that they're housemade, but our batch lacked the crunch it needed. The pico de gallo was fresh and delicious. I thought the use of Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) as a sauce was a nice touch. Overall, just a shrug. I could do without it. I liked the crunch achieved on the fresh tortilla on the Flautas, but again, no sparks. The guacamole and gochujang sauce was interesting! The Tamal was dry and surprisingly flavorless (my friend agreed). Lastly, the Kimchee Fried Rice was flavorful and spicy! Neither of us really cared for it, but I won't deny that it was good.   When you don't like something that is extremely popular, you find yourself having to explain your reasoning in great detail. The food is okay, borderline good. I may have enjoyed it more without the high expectations of these dishes being \"amazing.\" It's certainly not better or superior to their Mexican counterparts (I would choose carne asada nachos over bulgogi nachos every time) and as Korean cuisine, it lacks. The good stuff? The portions are generous and the price is right! I am willing to give the place another whirl though. Who doesn't believe in second chances?",

Korean food and Mexican foods go surprisingly well together - though it is hardly a secret anymore. My buddy and I tried out three dishes.  1. Bulgogi Burrito with kimchee 2. Bulgogi Nachos 3. Enchilada Plate with spicy pork  We were poorly prepared for the portion sizes. We could easily have taken 2/3 of every plate home, but we stuffed our faces full of the delicious food. The nachos in particularly are strikingly large in volume, and would require a number of people to down it as an appetizer.

    "text": "\"It's a good thing this place is near my work, or else it would have taken forever to take the time and effort to go here.\" That was my initial thought. Turns out, this place is very worth the time and effort to get to.  Never mind the interior design and the small parking area. The food here is good. I tried the bulgogi burrito for the first time, and I never knew it would be that tasty. A little spicy, but still it gives me a symphony of flavors.   Although I was confused at first whether to order at the counter or sit down, I soon figured out it was a sit-down place. Doi. Go figure.  Anyway, the burrito is huge. Worth the price. They stuff it with tons of ingredients including the oh so tasty bulgogi. As I was halfway finished, the tortilla ripped apart and I was left with a pile of stuff. Delicious stuff. And I used my hand to eat it all up. You know it's good when you finish a mess with your hands.  Must go here again for more exquisite deliciousness.",

There were even other customers complaining asking where their food was. Come to find out, the food was just sitting on top of the counter waiting to be served. Another couple next to us paid for their drinks and left after waiting way too long for their food.   We finally got our food after about 30 mins. We ordered the bulgogi fries, combination fried rice and the bulgogi burrito. Everything just tasted average. Nothing to rave about.   I will not be coming back.",

The rice had a nice egg on top and tasted reminiscent of kimchee, but the shrimp (for which I paid extra) were non-existent.  Also, it lacked flavor and the rice was flabby.  When I think of Korean food, never does flabby rice darken my thoughts...  The tacos were pretty good, although the tortilla was too thick for my liking.  The nachos were good, but forgettable.  Also the area of town, and specifically the parking lot, are nightmares.    So I likely won't go back, but OTOH I wouldn't speak ill of the place either if someone suggested going....",

    "text": "Korean and Mexican fusion is becoming obscenely popular. We have quite a few fusion places in Portland (Koi Fusion, Korean Twist, etc), but KoMex just has everything to offer.  Large portions, cheap prices, funny logo, excellent service, delicious food and awesome owners.  You can tell that they value their patrons when you see their menu. Quite a few honorable mentions.  They have some of the best drink options, as well. I was having a hard time with choosing a drink. That sounds lame, but it's not often that you have the flavors mixed together that are found in this fusion food.  If you check in with your Yelp mobile app, you get a free order of fried wontons. Take advantage. They are little fried pillows of food heaven.  I decided on the bulgogi chimichanga with kim chi on the side. Good choice.  My jaw dropped when it came out. It was the size of a small baby (sorry for the scarring visual).  I saw it as a challenge. Every bite became more delicious than the last. No bulgogi meat was spared. I killed it.  They bring you chips, too. Fresh fried chips. They might be the best chips ever. I ate like King Henry VIII. I think my tummy hit the table by the time I was done.  While they are most popular for their fusion food, they also offer both asian and mexican food - separately. It's like a 3-in-1 restaurant. You could eat here 5+ times a week (I'm not condoning this, but it IS possible).",

    "text": "I'm an avid foodie, who also unfortunately has a gluten intolerance.  However, I know that Mexican food tends to be safe, so I figured that if my husband and I went here during our trip to Vegas, there would at least be something I could eat.    We arrived about 10 minutes before open, and I'm glad that we did.  The place filled up very fast.  The great thing about this place is that because everything is made fresh, I was able to verify what items contained gluten.  My server was unsure of which fusion meats were marinated in soy sauce, but he promptly got the owner who was able to answer all of my questions.    I was disappointed to find out that all of the fusion meats have soy sauce, except for the pork.  The Kimchi unfortunately has soy sauce too.  So my options were semi-limited, but  I was thrilled with the fact that I could still try some fusion food.    I had the Bulgogi Nachos with pork and my hubby had the Fusion sliders with pork. His sliders looked fantastic and he was very happy with the heat.  My nachos were  phenomenal.  I loved that the chips were nice and thick, and therefore didn't get soggy.  The tast of the sweet/spicy pork with the cheese, pico, and hot sauce was unlike any other nachos that I've ever eaten.    The star of the show was definitely the sauce that the pork is marinated in.  I loved the sweet/spicy/sesame flavor.  I tried to ask the owner what was in it, and he advised that his brother makes it on site, and that it's a secret recipe.  My hubby and I loved it so much that we bought some to take home with us back to Arizona.  I was hoping to duplicate it, but so far no luck.    The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I was disappointed so many menu items have soy sauce in them, and are therefore off limits to me.  But the food that I did have was absolutely outstanding.      We both enjoyed our meal so much that we have decided that KoMex is a must on all of our future trips to Vegas.  We even wanted to stop by before leaving town, but couldn't due to bad planning.  This was actually one of the highlights of our entire trip and I can't wait to come back, even if it's just to try those tasty nachos again.",

Some people are annoyed by that,but I like knowing that I order, they cook it, and then bring it out fresh and hot. They serve the food with a cart of 4 different hot sauces, ranging from mild and sweet to spicy..  I always love the food here. I'd give it 5 stars if the location was bigger and l little more upscale, but I'm totally comfortable with the smaller cafe feel of the place now.",

Parking was sparse, but manageable.  Service, though understaffed and overwhelmed, was polite.  Food took a while to cook, and was alright.

    "text": "Another local gem. It may not look like much from the outside -- a small shop in a rundown old stripmall off of Decatur -- but inside you'll find some of the best fusion tacos and other great food at a modest price.  This place is all about the food. Both Korean-Mexican fusion tacos ($1.29 ea.) I tried were amazing. The pork and beef in each was a wonderful blend of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. The tacos were generously topped with their respective protein, along with cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro.  The pastor sope ($2.59) was a sizable portion of pork over beans and a light, crispy corn base and topped with lettuce and cotija cheese. The pork was excellent, without being too spicy.  The hand-made pork wontons ($1) came four to an order. All were crispy and delicious -- as good as any fried wontons around.  The bulgogi fusion burrito ($4.99) is big and delicious. It's stuffed with the same delicious beef as the tacos, along with Mexican rice, onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. There's no doubt this is the best burrito I've had.  The weakest dish I've had was the orange chicken ($3.49 for a half order). While the quality of the chicken was great, it lacked the punch in flavor that the other food had.  On my first visit I was given chips and fresh guacamole after ordering. On my second visit no chips -- they were busy so maybe they just forgot. And to finish the meal they deliver orange slices and fortune cookies. Everything may seem like an odd combination, but it all works because it's all delicious.",

I grew up on the best home cooked Korean food around (shout out to my Ma!) I also have access to the BEST Mexican food around.  LA has it going on.  So maybe...just maybe...these things worked against me in this instance.  I wasn't impressed with the Korean or the Mexican aspect of this place.  Neither really stood out.  I was thinking like Street taco style tacos with Korean spice.   My mom pointed out that she and I could probably do better putting kimchee on street tacos in LA.    I tried the chicken, pork and bulgogi tacos, the kimchee fried rice with spam and Spam musubi with fried egg.   -The tacos were just okay.  The meat in all three really could have been kicked up a notch.  They weren't memorable at all.  Not even the slaw on top had any flavor.  I had to drench with hot sauce (sauces are really good.  they come in a holder with 3 sauces) and tons of lime juice.  I do really like that you can get them with tortillas or in lettuce cups.  add a star for that.  -The kimchee fried rice was just too...mushy.  And the spam was chopped so fine and tiny that I couldn't taste it.  Either add more or don't cut them so tiny.  I want to taste the spam.  Why else would I order it? -spam musubi with egg.  can't mess that up really.    Service was kind of slow.  We had to ask our server for stuff or just get up and get it ourselves.  A few times she just ignored us completely.  Whatever.  I don't want to knock this place. I give them mad props for the creative aspect.  Another star for that.  They have a good following here.  I'm just saying...if you're used to really good Korean food and really authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place for you.",

However, the last few times I have gotten food from here which were spread far apart, it has been a disappointment. I definitely see a lack in not only meat in my burrito but also flavor!

The first time I went to the North Decatur location I got a little lost. The place isn't easy to find but as I did a U turn, I saw a very long line out the door of a hole in the wall looking place, looked up and realized I was in the right place! I quickly pulled in, parked and waited in line. Despite the long line and how small the space is, the cashiers moved through each persons order rather quickly. When I got to the counter, I had asked them what their best vegetarian & vegan friendly dishes were and by was I surprised on how informed and genuinely friendly their staff was. It wasn't long before I placed my order. An extra spicy Korean vegan burrito, french fries and a drink. Needless to say, I fell in love and have been eating at KoMex ever since.  Now, I tend to frequent the Buffalo & Flamingo location simply because it's closer to where I live but don't worry, both locations are fantastic! Do not miss these hidden gems!",

And I just saw someone mention that drinks are canned/bottled... this is True.... but they have the most delicious unsweetened iced tea (I think it is mango flavored) and there are free refills on that one! It is soooo good! Just go check it out... you won't be diappointed.",

    "text": "What is the best way to get an Asian to eat Mexican food? Make it fusion with Korean. After a few years of working in a Mexican and then a Southwestern restaurant, Mexican is usually lower on my list of favorite cuisines.   With Komex, they definitely change that mindset. For $2, you will get a taco that is stuffed full of meat, veggies, and ask for kimchi. If you are trying to go lighter, the option of a lettuce wrap instead of tortillas can be done. The bulgogi is my favorite to put into or onto anything. Tacos... BULGOGI!... Nachos... BULGOGI! It does not matter, bulgogi needs to go on it.",

    "text": "We had been meaning to try this place for a while, but weren't sure if it would be picky-eater (aka, the kiddo) friendly so we went while the wee one was away on vacation.  It's tucked in a strip mall and the space is very small but it seems like a small operation so don't let that deter you from trying it out!  The service was more like when you go to a friend's dinner party and they're running around all crazy trying to play host/hostess... a little chaotic and sporadic but they get the job done.  Also, they are very friendly!  The food was great.  I had chicken fusion taco, the hubs had chicken fried rice, and we split the fusion bulgogi fries.  They also bring you chips and salsa to snack on while you peruse the menu.  The chicken bulgogi in the taco was delicious (btw, they are wee tacos,  so if you want to try different kinds, you could probably order 3 and have an entree-sized meal), I really enjoyed it.  We had a half order of the fries and it was plenty for 2 adults (and we both are pretty good eaters).  The fried rice was better than your standard take-out fried rice, and the hubs didn't cover it in soy sauce like he usually does.    All in all, the food is great, next time I might just call in an order and pick it up.  They also had a note on their menu that the menu has been truncated to allow for expansion....  no indication of where the other location will be, I hope it's closer to me though!",

    "text": "Before I tried Komex - which my brother has been raving about for years - I thought I hated \"fusion.\"  Every fusion thing I had tried before was gross.  But, because it is my brother's favorite place, I went into it with an open mind.  There are vegetarian options (tofu, veggies, bean & cheese), but it seems like this place is more of a winner for the meat-eaters.  I had the cheese enchiladas (not fusion style) and the seasoned fries.  (The menu has fusion stuff, just Mexican stuff, Asian stuff, and American stuff.)  My plan was to make my own fusion - enchiladas and fries!  Who does that!  No one!  Fusion!  I got a side of kimchi as well, in case I felt like getting real nuts.  (My brother got a side of the stir fried kimchi ($2) and this is way better than the normal kimchi - go for it.)  The enchiladas by themselves were nothing special.  I think they had mozzarella cheese on them, which was weird.  There was just too much cheese in general.  Beans were good though.  I tried some bites with kimchi, and it was a winner.  The fries were great though.  I put some of the sauces they give you on the fries, along with some of my side of kimchi, and they were booooommmmb.  This should be something you can order - feel free to call it \"Leslie's Favorite.\"   Because of this good experience, next time I'd be willing to try an actual fusion item - which is a big step because before Komex I had sworn off ever trying anything fusion again.  Service was great, but I didn't like all the people waiting for a table staring me down while I was trying to enjoy my meal - put those suckers behind a screen or something!",

As everyone mentioned, the food was great & the portions were huge. The burritos were like whoa! Loved all the tacos. The chicken tacos were my favorite. Everything seemed so fresh from the chips to the salsa. I loved the flavors of all the sauces. My kids loved the chicken taquitos.   One time, I ordered the kimchi fried rice w/ an egg & I had leftovers for days. It's freak'n huge! The service is excellent. They made sure our fresh chips fresh guac & fresh salsa was filled.   I appreciated the fact that they sell the cold glass bottled soda beverages that use pure cane sugar instead of the corn syrup crap out there.   It's also nice that they have different kinds of food options. American, Mexican, Asian or Fusion. It's great because my oldest son isn't too fond of the Asian flavors but he likes Mexican & American & my youngest loves the Asian flavors. So w/ their menu being so versatile, really helped make the our decisions easier for the whole family.   The whole meal was an amazing value for us. Great food, great service & unbeatable prices. What more can u ask for? I can't wait to go back & get some more of those delicious chicken tacos. In fact, I can't wait until they have a location closer to my side of town in the southwest.",

The fusion of cultures and foods were actually above par. When mixing Bulgogi and Flautas, it was great and bazar. But the place settings were were decorated with folklore from China, which is something I'd expect in South Carolina; I don't think they really know who they are.  Mexican, Korean, and a little Chinese, with food so great it brought me to my knees. Though I would be remiss if I forgot to mention their sauce, it was their winning combination that made them so boss. I will always accept your fusion guac with a thank you and please.  The wait staff was nice, they accommodated our vegetarian not once, but twice. Was it the greatest? I do not think so, but I'd highly recommend that you all go.

The wings were spicy but not too spicy, the beef was tasty and it was a hefty portion, the fettuccine was perfectly al-dente and the tostada was fusion of the two cultures(Mexican and Korean) at its best. Linda also politely cautioned us about purchasing the kimchi fried rice, as many westerners such as ourselves, may not enjoy it if they have not tried kimchi before, which was very kind given that it was our first time in the restaurant and she didn't know we love kimchi. Our second experience was just as good as our first, but this time we tried the fusion nachos, the pan fried fish, and the combination bulgogi with stir fried veggies. The fusion nachos were fantastic and there were a lot of them, the pan fried/grilled fish was done perfectly and the bulgogi was a home run just like the first time but with more meat and veggies. I will keep coming back to KoMex fusion because the food is great, the service is great, its conveniently located and the price is right. Great Job KoMex.",

Parking is terrible here but when you are lucky enough to find a spot and enter Komex, all that stress and frustration is out the window. What you might stress over is that you forgot your elastic pants on to fit all that food in your system.  SERVICE Fairly slow but they give you complimentary chips which comes with salsa and guacamole. Enjoy those chips while they prepare your food.   FOOD My favorite is their fusion taco. I like mine with beef and or chicken. I also like to substitute pico de gallo for kimchi which adds a nice kick. These things are $1-$2 and is off the hook. Make sure to order 2 or 3 of them since each taco is small and won't fill you up.   I've also gotten their bulgogi cheesesteak. Flavorful bulgogi but too much cheese for me personally. Huge portion.   Burritos here are humongous. Half of this will fill you up. It just means you have the other half of burrito to take home and enjoy the next day. Packed with goodness and it's so good.   CONCLUSION Perfect as late night food except they are not open late. You definitely get the bang for your buck. Good food with slow service = 4 stars.",

The bulgogi and kimchee here don't necessarily impress as standalone items, but in a taco you should enjoy them?

I tried the fusion chimichanga with bulgolgi and shared the bulgolgi bachos. These nachos are on point and definitely worth the price. The chimichanga was okay, but I think i should have just gotten a burrito. It was kind of oily and I think it was his the outside I wasn't feeling.   The service was great. We got there when they opened so they were definitely attentive. They checked on us enough, but not too much that it constantly interrupted our conversation. I would definitely recommend this place for some good cheap food!",

    "text": "Oh man, Komex, what an amazing place to eat! If you're not from Vegas, this is a restaurant to eat at. If you live in Vegas, make the trip and at least try it out!  I never heard about this place until I started doing this volunteer program at a school near there. On the way home from there. I was shown this place and I ate there with a group of friends.   The first time there, I was a newbie and I didn't really know how to eat there or what to order, but my friends just suggested getting one taco of each type of Korean meat. I admit that it was delicious! They put a good amount of meat in the tacos and they overfill it with vegetables. They serve each taco with lime and have kimchi on request. If you've never been here, that's what I suggest that you do the first time to try. But if not, take a look at their menu at anything else that gets your attention. A cool thing that they do is that they serve nachos with salsa and guacamole free in the beginning of each meal and some orange and fortune cookies at the end!  The name is Komex after all, so it's a Korean Mexican fusion restaurant. They have a lot of Mexican staples like burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tortas, etc, but with Korean meat! Those would be the main things I would be looking for along with other things with Korean meats. The fried rice and kimchi fried rice are something good to try in my opinion. If you love Mexican food though, the bulgogi nachos or bulgogi fries are the things to try!  The bulgogi fries are personally my item of choice between the two, but people have their preferences. Everything blends well together. The bulgogi sometimes feels like it fits in better, but of course, that again depends on the person. A full order will take a beast or a few people to finish, so if you're by yourself, consider ordering a half order.   The servers are always very nice people, especially the lady. They are always attentive and more than willing to help you out with menu choices or just any other request you may have!",

    "text": "KoMex was awesome.  Just what you'd expect with a Mexican/Korean fusion description.  Nachos with kimchi and bulgogi, tacos with Korean dressing, Korean burritos, and more.  It is all very affordable, very delicious, and very spicy, if that's your thing.  The service was a little slow but the meal was very solid.  They serve you some pita chips with salsa to begin and give you a great variety of hot sauces from Mexican to Korean in tast and hotness to choose from. Note: this location does not serve alcohol but the other one does.  I recommend the pork belly tacos with flour tortillas or lettuce wraps. ($3ish for 1).  But I bet everything is good here.",

    "text": "Woah, this place was truly amazing.  Prior to visiting here, I never realized Korean and Mexican could fusion so well.  I actually did set my GPS to here driving down from Salt Lake City, and they are just located a bit northwest from the Strip.  The interior felt just like a Korean restaurant.  The place seems packed all the time even though we arrived during late lunch hours.  The chips with guacamole shredded off the Korean feel immediately.  We decided on Kimchi Beef Fried Rice and Spicy Pork Chimichanga per other yelpers recommendations.  The rice was absolutely delicious, all the ingredients worked very well together, and even my wife who is a picky rice eater could not stop eating it.  The chimichanga probably bridged the Pacific very well with dega bulgogi inside a fried burrito.  Their mango passion fruit ice tea was decent.  KoMex was truly amazing, it is definitely high on my must visit places when I am in Vegas.  We really wanted to order more things, but our stomachs reached its limited.  It seems like they are opening another location in Spring Valley area.",

We came here during lunch hour, and we were seated within 1 minute. It was a large group, but they had no trouble. The service was good they filled my water multiple times (which is important, since I drink like a camel when at restaurants). They brought out the food, fresh and hot!  what we got: 1. Fried rice with tofu! So good, it was a half portion and $6.5 and more than I could handle 2. The Nachos--nice favor, bolgogi meat plus pico de gallo, jalapenos cheese. Would skip next time. 3. Spam musubi--large portions! Very good! 4. Bolgogi meat, rice and chicken  Will come again, would recommend it to others",

    "text": "OK.  In the interest of full disclosure, I have known the YI family for several years, but didn't know they opened a restaurant until I read a great review in Las Vegas Weekly.  I had to check it out on the basis of that review alone, since it was great.  Living 20 miles away, I brought my wife, stepdaughter, and 3 other people to Komex last Saturday night before the big party at the Hustler Club.  Komex is a little hard to find, but is well worth it.  The space is very intimate, and we sat in the rear booth right next to the kitchen.  Bryttni and Lynda Yi are very gracious hosts, and if I see one more post about hooking your buddy up with Bryttni (Lawrence T), you and I will have to have a sit-down until you learn some manners.    Anyway, the best way I can sum up Komex is as follows:  1)  Huge portions.  2)  Excellent quality.  3)  Great service and family atmosphere.  4)  Unbelievable value.  5)  Low Carb friendly.  When we received our bill, we thought there was some mistake.  We couldn't believe that 6 of us were stuffed to the gills with such splendid cooking for such a low price.  As such, we left a 30% tip, as that was only fair for the value received.  Their burrito is big enough to choke a horse, and my friend Pat had to have us help him finish it.  It makes the Chipotle Beef Fajita look like a snack!  SIX THUMBS UP!  GK  PS - This is now a weekly excursion for our crew.",

    "text": "And this is why you shouldn't put your trust in humanity. How could such a mediocre food establishment obtain the coveted 4.5 stars with close to 1,000 reviews? Coincidence? I think not. Upon reading the 4 recommend reviews tied between extreme love and hate, I decided to trust the consensus.. Mistake. I should've have trusted Mandi L's pinpointed summary of this joint.   Upon browsing the menu, a feeling of uneasiness began to set in. Fusion? What fusion? The only condiment separating this spot from a Los Betos was a Korean slaw-- your typical vinegar slaw, disguising itself as an Asian stalple via soy sauce.   We ask the waiter/cashier for his recommendations-- he says the chimichanga and cheesesteak. A man at the table next to us is praising the cheesesteak so we oblige-- obviously electing beef for the cheesesteak, and pork for the chimi, per recommendation. The plates walked down the aisle to our table with a salsa platter-- two Mexican salsas, and two Korean sauces. Upon first bite, I hit a void of flavor. For the remainder of my meal, I found myself dousing each bite with both sweet and hot Korean sauces-- craving to make my sad Mexican/Philly meal reach the fictions land of fusion-- but I was left in limbo.   I didn't mention the stacks of cheap-ass 80pack corn tortillas lining the kitchen window, nor the weird pita chips that served as \"fusion\" chips and salsa, or the fact I didn't get my 8oz water glass filled once during my meal-- because they didn't affect the overall mediocrity of this meal. Unless you want to help diminish Komex's star rating to something more accurate (2-3 stars) and prevent future yelpers from being led astray, don't go here.",

    "text": "Okay, before my boyfriend and I went to KoMex, I was really excited and we really wanted to give this place a 5 star.  After trying this place out myself to see what the hype was all about, after all it's only like the most highly rated place on Yelp.  We ordered 2 beef (bulgogi) tacos, 2 pork belly tacos, 2 chicken tacos, and shared KimChi fried rice with bulgogi.  The beef tacos were good, but honestly carne asada tacos from like Pepe's are much better and the same cost.  Ranking it as bulgogi, is rather unsatisfying as well since it lacked well marinated flavors that I usually taste with bulgogi.  The pork belly tacos were the most delicious tacos that we had, it was slightly spicy but not over bearing, I have absolutely no complaints.  At the same time, they were not delicious enough for me to merit higher ratings.  The chicken tacos were tasteless, DON'T ORDER.  The KimChi fried rice with bulgogi was served with a fried egg on top, the presentation was great!  The rice itself was alright at best, the kimchi part, was not spicy, it just tasted like it lacked something.  Kimchi that I buy generically in the asian grocery store has more kick.  So we did add quite a bit of garlic chili to it to make me taste better.  I'm not really too sure if they subdued the taste down to white people spicy to make it more palatable since I saw on the menu that they were trying to franchise.  My advice is just stay True to the recipes.  The service is excellent, I'm pretty sure it was family run.  They were super nice and attentive, and if I could rate it based on service alone then I would give them a four star review.  The ambiance, is really shatty.  I would not be caught dead in that area after the sunsets.  The interior of the restaurant looks like it needs a face lift, and some deep cleaning.    Overall, it was alright at best.  I would probably never come back, or go out of my way to eat there though.  So unless you are already in the vicinity don't bother driving out of your way.",

    "text": "Back in Los Angeles, \"Kogi\" is the heralded as the best Mexican/Korean fusion food especially since they are reported to have first introduced the idea. I don't care who started it or what not, but Komex is far better.  Owned by a middle-older aged married(?) Korean couple, Komex express offers a variety of fusion made foods rooted from Mexican and Korean style. They not only serve fusion tacos but they also serve the traditional tacos with pastor, asada, and etc. And no this ain't no Roberto's, it's actually legitimate Mexican food that they serve.   In my first visit, I ordered a pastor taco, asada taco, and bulgogi fries.  The tacos were nothing special nevertheless, delicious and they are as good as it gets.   The bulgogi fries were amazing. For those of who you don't know what bulgogi is, it's marinated beef. And in this case, it is cooked and cut to small pieces so that it can be collected when forked upon along with the fries, cilantros, and etc. Oh man were these good. If a half hispanic and half Korean were to have tried these, I'm sure they would have had a identity crisis.  The only negative thing I would say about this place is the location. It is located right on the border of las vegas and north las vegas, south of the intersection of decatur and washington. I would love for the owners to move or start up another business more in Spring Valley or the South because that is where they are surely to get more business.   If you're a biracial with Hispanic and Korean in your blood, be prepared to see a psychologist after trying the bulgogi fries cause that food may confuse you of your ancestrial roots and ethnic identity!",

IT'S INCREDIBLE) I have enjoyed the spam mousabi, chicken fusion burrito, the chicken fusion tacos (my boyfriend and his friend absolutely love the fish and shrimp tacos).  I am a complete fan of any fusion item on the menu.  BUT....  I am not a fan of the Mexican burrito and the carne asada fries aren't that good either. BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU!  the food is truly amazing as well as the owners and the people that work in there. the food is beyond reasonably priced and there is no reason why you shouldn't go there RIGHT NOW! go go go!",

Don't be scared of the hood it's in, or the strip mall location, and don't be put off by the lack of decor or a/c - just go in, grab a seat, and get ready for insane flavor delerium!  Worth it for the free freshly made guacamole & freshly fried chips alone (dude - I wanted a vat of that guac to take with me), but it gets so much better!  I had four of the best freakin' tacos I've ever had for $5. FIVE BUCKS! Completely worth it, totally delicious, and super, super fresh & tasty. These people know exactly what they're doing.  PS - you HAVE to get the in-house made hot sauce for the table, too - you will not be sorry!",

Definitely must-try's are Bulgolgi fries, even the half size is very big... lots of fries with jalapenos, cheese and bulgogi- it's a very savory and filling mix. And OMG, the kimchi fried rice was HELLA good, greasy, but that's because it's fried. The fried rice packed a lot of flavors in every bite, my favorite dish here! If you want a healthier option, the chicken fusion burrito is delicious and feels very light. The chicken tasted like it was lightly grilled or boiled, but something about it made it very moist, yet very healthy (non-greasy). The salsa in the burrito is really refreshing!  The restaurant is a little crowded. The workers are sooo nice and pretty attentive. The prices are really good considering the amount you get.   Just fyi, if you want spices, you have to ask for it. :)  They also give you chips, salsa, and guacamole when you come in.",

Service was awesome.  Ambiance lacked luster but honestly who gives a darn with the quality of food and amazing service!! Also ask for the spice rack. 4 homemade sauces all unique and super tasty!!

    "text": "After my brother in-law had endorsed this place we had to try it.  I typically don't travel this far for tacos but, the fusion of Korean, Mexican, American, and Chinese... come on you gotta try it.  The owners of the small restaurant are husband and wife.  The wife was super nice and was always attentive and shared stories of how they started the business.  And, the husband does all the cooking.  Anyhow, business was good and people that were in and out were on a first name basis with the owners (that's always a plus).  We started our meal with chips with salsa and guacamole.  With the chips we were also given Chinese Zodiac place mats....only at KoMex (gotta love the quirks).  Skimming the menu I started with a craving for the fusion tacos (Korean/Mexican) but, then I wanted a plate of noodles...LOL when does that ever happen if you're not at a buffet.  We ended up getting 5 Bul-gogi (Beef) tacos and a rice plate with Daeji-gogi (pork).  We were going to order more but the owner recommended that we didn't even though she could of just let us order.  And she was right, the quantity was more than enough!  On to the quality...the Bul-gogi tacos were filled with green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce and your choice of sauce.  They brought a smile to my face.  Also, the Daeji-gogi was so delicious!  For me I have to have KimChi on the side as a pickled garnish.  Anyhow, after finishing our delicious Korean/Mexican meal we ended our visit with a sliced orange and fortune cookies for desert.  The only thing that I had an issue with was the location.  I just wish this place was a little closer and they would definitely have a regular customer.  My brother is coming to town at the end of the month and I love trying to impress him with food spots they don't have back in Chicago.  This is one of the hole in the wall places that will definitely make an awesome impression on his taste buds.",

But, your taste buds and wallet will thank you. We took a taxi(not recommended unless you schedule them to pick you back up)  Nevertheless, we waited happily for 30 minutes chatting up on how great this meal was.  In the end, taxi never showed and the owner Linda graciously offered us a ride back to our hotel.  I've never rated on yelp before and this may just be the beginning of more to come.  KoMex will be tough to beat on budget and value.  I see a bright future ahead for these folks.  THANKS AGAIN!",

Even when you first walk into the restaurant the building and decorations look like some budget Chinese place that chops up cats in the back alley.  In reality this hands down the best Korean Tacos in town and some of the best food period I've had in Vegas.  If you have $5 and are REALLY hungry go here, because you will get a pile of some of the best food around.",

The bulgogi burrito was amazingly delicious, and I would recommend it to any first timers going to komex. Sharing fries was a good decision, as it took 3 of us to finish the plate.   We had to pay at the counter, like a school cafeteria, but that was most likely because of the limited staff.   Good food, good price, not the best environment.",

My spicy Korean pork burrito was gigantic and filled to the brim with delicious tender pork, fresh pico de gallo, flavorful Mexican rice, onions, kimchi, and lettuce.

Excellent food for getting rid of that death feeling after ingesting too much alcohol at 3am.

The nachos come with a hot sauce that is absolutely amazing. At first, it looked like it might be too spicy, but then out of nowhere it hits you upside the head with a sweet kick. I also tried Jim's bulgogi fried rice- WOW! Could be the best thing I ever ate -- at least top 3. Strangely addicting, this fried rice doesn't come with the previously mentioned hot sauce-but go ahead and add some.   For a party of 5, we spent about 40 dollars and had leftovers to take home.

The chimichanga was mouth watering, so good that the burrito seemed flavorless!   The fried rice was also surprisingly good, my daughter ate it like it was the best meal she'd ever had.  The quesadilla was cooked just right with tasty cheese, but the burrito is where the meal fell short.

On our way home (but not really on the way to Cali), we made it a point to try it out. I gotta say, this will be a mandatory visit each time I come out here! Komex lived up to all the hype on Yelp.   The place is small and doesn't seat too many, so I would suggest arriving with enough time to cover this, just in case. When we got there, it was full and we waited in line for about 20 minutes to be seated. After being seated, we waited another 10 minutes to get our order in. The staff were super busy working nonstop the entire time and noticing this, I see that the wait is part of the visit. Don't hold that against them.   As for the food...mmmm...made to order...mmmm...fresh...mmmm...OK, back to the review...So, you get an order of chips, salsa and guacamole after you order. Tasty and good.   - Spicy pork taco for $2 was awesome! Not so spicy though, so don't worry.  -  Bulgogi Nachos was the business! You HAVE to try this out. The Bulgogi meat is more of a teriyaki beef type, sweetened, tender and juicy. A nice pico de gallo blend on top and some beans and mozzarella cheese! This was a mouthful of flavor in each bite.  - Shrimp fried rice was sooo good!! Some of the best I've had -  Bulgogi chicken and rice was fantastic, says my 18 y/o daughter -  Carne asada taco eaten by my 5 year old didn't stand a chance. He said he loved it. -  Enchilada plate eaten by my 11 year old looked good too -  Spam Musubi was just as good as the rest of it, says my 15 y/o daughter. You get 2 fat \"rolls\" in 1 order  As you can see, we ordered a lot of food and each of us were more than happy with what we had...We also had enough to take some for the ride home.   Overall, arrive early, have patience, the portions are big, the price is small and the flavor is incredible. ...And the staff is busy making your food! I see that they are in the process of expanding and hope we get one in Cali...",

It was the special on one of my lunch visits and the best dang fusion pot roast over rice you can imagine. Flavored were sweet and savory and the meat so tender it just melts into the rice.",

Never had a fusion of Mexican and Korean, but very happy we decided to try it. We ordered the beef nachos, chicken quesadilla, all three types of tacos, and the beef flautas. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Las Vegas or traveling through, you're sure to find something you like here at KoMex.",

    "text": "I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Believe me when I say I have thought about it OFTEN since my last trip to Vegas.  Food, prices, service--a True five star place found in an unassuming strip mall off the strip.  Free chips and salsa upon arrival, and a check-in deal for some tasty dumplings.  I had three tacos with Kimchi (one pork, one chicken, one beef).  They were $1.50ish each.  All three were extremely generous in size, flavor, and taste.  I probably liked the beef one best.  It was one of those meals that I didn't want to finish because I'd be too sad when it was over, but I decided to eat it all because I was worried the tacos would lose their magic once Primm was in the rear-view mirror.  CHECK OUT OF YOUR HOTEL AND THEN GO HERE for lunch before driving back to LA.  My riding partner saved one of her tacos and it was still wonderful in Barstow, so you could even load up on to-go.  This place has minor issues with lack of fountain drinks (they have cans), a location that is a bit remote, and a strange bathroom; however, none of these conditions can even threaten these five stars.  A memorable meal for two at under $10.  If you haven't been here, you're making a mistake.  Sorry about all the hype.",

If you don't try this place at least once while visiting Las Vegas you have significantly diminished your experience there. If you are a local and don't go here on a somewhat regular basis, move to Idaho.   Trust me, you'll love it and if you don't then you don't love america.. or mexico... or korea.",

My boyfriend compared it to regular carne asada.  As for the musubi, there's more rice than the pork belly, and the pork belly is not tasty enough to overcome the quantity of rice inside the musubi.   The service is ok. It was funny to see the server and a customer argue about \"Asian hot sauce\".   All in all, I expected better. Greatly disappointed.",

Not gonna lie...its just a bag but it killed my excitement for trying this highly rated yelp restaurant though.  I am Korean and eat a lot of Mexican food so this is my cup of tea. Living in LA/OC also gives a lot of exposure to this genre of food so I was definitely excited to taste and see.  We ordered Jim's fried rice. Tastes exactly the way I make at home so my boys were happy to have a \"home-cooked\" style meal on vacation. I ordered spicy pork taco lettuce wrap and fish taco. I guess I should have ordered Sauteed Kim Chee with it because the pork taco was flavorful but missing the wow factor without Kim Chee. The fish taco was rather disappointing. Nothing super about it. We also ordered the pork chimichanga which was tasty but a little to oily for me.  Overall...the service was great but if the guy didn't spill water on my bag I would have given this place 3 stars instead of 2. Although i am a fan of local mom and pop shops I don't see myself going out of my way to come back.",

However, the second location opened pretty recently, and it was a extremely disappointing the last time I had it.  Being a frequent customer for the past year or so, I did not hesitate to buy $40 worth of food for the family. I always tell my friends about this place. Unfortunately, something happened here recently (maybe a new chef), and the quality decreased significantly. Here's the meal we had:  Fusion Burrito: Soggy. Extremely soggy. It tasted like somebody drenched the greens inside with water and removed any semblance of rice and meat. I could barely eat half of it. This used to be a favorite of mine!  Fusion Quesadilla (with spicy pork): Also disgusting! I don't know how you mess up spicy pork and cheese. I got this for my little niece, and she barely had two bites. I thought something was wrong with her, so I tried it too. Straight to the trash... How can a quesadilla have a weird aftertaste?  Shrimp Taco: The shrimp was definitely old. The aged seafood smell spread strongly throughout the house.  We had a few more things, and they were adequate I guess. The aforementioned items were the worst.  I'm so, so disappointed. I'm tempted to leave one star, but I put two out of respect for what the restaurant once was. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but what I received was inexcusable.",

Korean-Mexican fusion food is nothing new to me, having eaten from the Kogi truck many times (as well as other imitators) in the LA/OC area. But I was curious about this place and its menu, so I had to check it out.  The is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, nestled in a cozy strip mall. We were greeted warmly, sat down, and wasted no time ordering. We were served complimentary chips with guacamole and salsa -- all of which were completely addicting before the food even arrived. We tried the following:  Fusion tacos, bulgogi and chicken: bright, fresh, and healthy. This was definitely my favorite. I loved the crispy texture from the slaw, and the meat was moist and tender. The kimchi on top gave that bit of tang to tie the \"fusion\" of it all together.  Bulgogi burrito: monstrous, filling, and utterly satisfying. I split this in half with my wife, and it was more than enough. The ratio of rice to meat was good, and the flavors were fantastic. A bit of hot sauce rounds it all up, flavor-wise.  Bulgogi fries, half order: this was my least favorite. The skinny fries were a bit on the soggy and greasy side, and the cheese was already hardened and coagulated by the time it got to our table. The sparse toppings of bulgogi was a bit disappointing as well. We picked at it, but we were already more than full with the burrito and tacos.  Service was superb. Our waters were always topped off, the waitresses always asked how we were doing, and smiled a lot. It was a great vibe in there. You could tell everyone in there was enjoying their food. It felt like I was a guest at a family or friends' home. We were even served chilled orange slices before the usual fortune cookies.  Overall, I'm a fan of the place. With the fusion tacos and burritos, the ingredients are fresh and not overly heavy. Kogi packs a huge punch with more intense flavors and spices, and can get a bit greasy. KoMex is sort of the more healthier and \"lighter\" version of Kogi, in my opinion. The food is nothing unique, but the ultra friendly prices and service pushes them to 5 stars in my book.",

    "text": "So I've been going on a bulgogi binge of late. This place is on the way home from work and I decided I had t see what all the yelping was about. It's in a small complex that has a couple of empty/broken into/deserted stores that really make you believe you took a wrong turn and may be entering the slums of Bombay. Either way, don't drive by too fast, otherwise you'll miss this camouflaged beauty..  The first time I came in, they said there would be a 30 minute wait for a to go order. I decided against the wait and made a plan of coming back the next day, but making sure to order ahead. I would recommend doing the same because I think 20-30 minutes is the norm for a to go order at any time of the day.  I ordered a Bulgogi and Kimchee burrito. Usually the only burritos I ever get are from Chipotle, but how can you pass up Korean Mexican? We don't have any of these places in Arizona so the novelty was not lost on me. The burrito was overfilled with bulgogi (the way i like it) and was super spicy (also the way i like it). Bottom line: It was super bueno. Make sure you have an ice cold drink to tolerate this burrito. And this place is light on your wallet, $5.50 or so was the total...but make sure you bring cash if your total is under $10.",

Is that all the sodas are cans or bottles so no free refills u have to pay for each can or bottle also it was pretty warm my baby was sweating inside",

My boyfriend and I agreed that the bulgogi tater tots stole the show. Cheesy, crunchy and super tasty!! With green onions and sour cream. Yummy! I love musubi, but never tried pork belly musubi before; it was damn good and they make them pretty big too.  Complimentary chips, salsa and guac. Guacamole was also delicious. Good stuff!",

It's a simple hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, low price, large portions, unique dishes, and amazing flavors. We've tried about everything on the menu, and it's all crazy good. Some of the best tacos I've ever had, some of the best fried rice I've ever had, the best salsa and guacamole I've ever had.  Even the sliders...why do they have sliders at a Korean Mexican restaurant?? I don't know, but thank heaven they did because those sliders are AMAZING! Go to Komex!! Order anything and slap some Komex sauce on it. You'll crave it til you can go back...",

My friends have been telling me about it for awhile, and I had heard about it but I was kind of nervous with the whole Asian/Mexican fusion. It didn't sound too appealing to me. This is a dive, but as I always say, I have found some of the most amazing food in the most unexpected places.   I remembered it the other day when we were running errands and my boyfriend didn't sound too excited either after I told him what it was. I assured him that I trusted my friend's opinion and that it had really good reviews on Yelp.   We had the following - (Mind you, this was only two of us.) Fushion Shrimp Taco  Fushion Daeji gogi Taco 2 chicken flautas Fusion Enchilada Plate with shrimp, Bulgogi (Beef), Dak-gogi (Chicken). They serve chips, salsa and guacamole. All very good. The salsa is awesome.  Oh, as always...a Mexican coke. This was all $17.00.  All very amazing. We both LOVED everything. Even the sauces they give you for the food were delicious!  I went back the NEXT DAY and got the Chow Fettuccine(Thick Noodles with Meat* and Vegetables) with beef.   ***Warning, they do use a lot of garlic, so expect to be tasting it for awhile after you eat.   I love this place, and it is one of my new favorites. The prices are AWESOME, service is friendly and very quick. Don't let the idea scare you, it's much better than you can imagine.",

Most recently it featured what is easiest described as a bibimbap taco salad. Delicious veggies, tender marinated meat, and a perfectly kick in the tastebuds sauce served over rice in a giant tostada, seriously more delicious than your average Korean BBB. I think  the secret is the healthy helping of fresh greens. It does appear that they aren't offering noodle dishes these days. No big deal.

And don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad but I would rather have either Korean or Mexican, but not mixed, which they also serve. I did like the chips the salsa and the guacamole they were very tasty, and I would stop here just for that. Service was very good, very friendly and attentive. The place is small but kept clean. Oh! And the Korean lady taking my order and asking me how I wanted the food made, in Spanish! Now that's a bonus star! (Review went from three to four.)

    "text": "Wow! Just got back from Ko Mex. Wife & I spent a whopping $19.55 for 3 fusion tacos, 2 tacquitos & kimchee fried rice!  Ko mex is just as most reviewers see it, a small shop in a strip mall that I would have easily passed had it not been for Yelp.  We drove the 10 miles from our hotel to try Ko Mex. All I can say is I wish we had one of these in Torrance. The Fusion tacos, both beef & chicken with kim chee were absolutely DEEEE LISH ISSS! But my fave was the lettuce wrap with pork! I let my wife taste it ( she had the kim chee rice ) & she wolfed 3/4 of the wrap while I was sucking down a Pina Jarrito!   Great service, we were so lucky it wasnt too busy so service was extra qwik. I love hitting these places during non peak days as you feel unrushed and can really enjoy the food....Oh btw, we had to bring half the rice home cuz we were so full! Add in orange & fortune cookies for dessert & you have one Fantastic place to Eat. So happy we found this treasure!",

They are all delicious, but I'd have to say the simple burrito and taco are my favorite. A basic burrito with Bulgolgi...sounds so simple but it works deliciously well together. The man who is always in the front is a little grumpy. He never smiles and seems to be in a bad mood every time. The other people are really nice though. Regardless. I absolutely love the food and will be coming back many many times!",

    "text": "A dive, and it's good!   Seating is very limited - so you may have to wait for a table before you can eat. They do have some chairs you can sit and wait for a table.  They do have 1 large table for a group - which is also screened off for privacy. The other side most seating is half chairs and booth style. The cushions on the booth could use a do over as the foam padding is kinda worn out. That and when I tried to place a package on one of the cushions - it wouldn't stay put, started to slide off the cushion. That's the only reason I suggest re-doing the padding. The cushion fabric is in great shape!  Food wise - Can't really complain! Very tasty! For the tot we ordered Bulgogi fried rice - very mild but good. For my taste buds - would have preferred a little more moisture (i.e. sauce or something), but hubby and child were happy with it as presented. Hubby ordered the Torta, and spicy pork taco. I had two spicy pork tacos. The tacos were surprisingly small - but LOADED to the brim, and overflowing with goody morsels. And surprisingly they were very filling - so I understand the small size. Hubby was extremely happy with the spicy pork as well, and he was overloading with his torta. The only part he wasn't fond of in the torta was the pickled jalapenos. He was kinda under the impression the jalapenos were diced up raw ones, not the pickled ones - so he was slightly disappointed about that. But he picked them out no probs.  We'll be back another day! Have to try the lettuce wrap tacos, and many others! :D",

Lots of smiles on hardworking people can only mean that love is being poured into these delicious bites.  That's right I said it! Delicious bites!   My favorite of course are the bulgogi beef tacos with a healthy cabbage slaw topping on some delicate corn tortillas! The grilled pork and chicken tacos were very tasty as well. Also, a large selection for bevrages  occupy a commerical slider fridge to the left of the restaurant so fear not if you take on too much salsa!  I am proud to say that I ate 5 whole tacos but not anywhere close to the amount of tacos Eric, Jen, Danny and Gabe ate.  I met some really cool people and I made out with a cool Komex T-shirt for being the only female who attempted this beast of a challenge. On a side note I'd reccommend checking out these fun Yelp events in the future.  I do recommend eating early at Komex because there is a nice crowd for dinner that pulls through and seating can fill up quickly.  Who'd of thought Korean and Mexican cuisine could match up perfectly? I guess Komex did!",

    "text": "This review is for my 2nd visit to KoMex. We showed up on a nice drizzly day ready for some fusion! We enter, there is only 1 other table occupied and we're offered high chairs right away and sit down. Hubby and I order their passion iced tea which is DELISH! We decide on the combo fried rice and I get the fusion torta. The rice had a perfect texture and was FULL of bulgogi, pork, and chicken. There was also the other fried rice staples egg, carrot, and peas. We ate almost all of it between the 3 of us but couldn't finish it lol. The fusion torta was AWESOME it comes with bulgogi, lettuce, jalapenos, tomatoes, avocado, onions, and mayo. They put a red sauce on it that I'm not sure what it was but still awesome and wasn't spicy! This thing is HUGE it has to be about 8-9 inches long and full of bulgogi. I super appreciate they don't skimp here. It would be so easy since it's a family run, small business to take away some protein!    I would never think a korean, mexican, chinese fusion place would be so kid friendly but it really is! There were 3 tables with kids at one point while we were eating. For being number 3 on Vegas' top rated on yelp they live up to it by far. The only downside is not having fountain drinks! I give them 4.5 stars!!!!",

    "text": "I LOVE this place! I've been here a few times on a whim and each time has been great. So far I've had: Spam Masubi, Teriyaki Chicken, fusion tacos, fusion burrito, and fish tacos, but there is still SO much more I want/need to try! The Spam Musubi was huge (probably why they call it \"Flintstone\" musubi) and you get two big ones for 3 bucks. The Spam was nice and crispy, but the rest of the musubi seemed to fall apart very easily (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FlNZd5fEHGYDhJ-FJYp-oDg%2Fl.jpg&s=e0766342d45ce5448f9bf920d15702ce60d21f6297326c4c111071a4d7d4ce19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>); Not a big problem though because I love Spam and rice anyway. The tacos are exploding with flavor and you can't beat the price ($1.29 a pop, really!!?). I've had the pork, chicken, beef, and fish taco. The fish tacos were a little too salty for me, but the rest were amazing. The burrito was also very large, but that didn't effect the quality. It was very flavorful, juicy, and oozing with deliciousness. I ate about half and brought the rest home to my brother who nearly killed it in one bite.   I can't wait to come back here. Every time we've gone, the service has been very fast and friendly. They even give you complimentary chips, dip, guac, and oranges (after the meal). I wish it wasn't so far from my house, but at least my boyfriend lives down the street from it, so I can get KoMex to-go ;)",

    "text": "My family and i decided to try this place based on the rave reviews here on yelp. We fed a family of 4 for less than $40. That's the only real plus is the price. They do give you a lot of food too. The taste however was nothing to write home about.  I had the spicy pork and beef bulgogi with rice. Although it was sorta good it tasted sorta dry. My wife had their beef fusion burrito and said it was the best she ever had.   This is a good family place because a lot of adults brought their kids there and they were just running around. For the first time ever I told my kids if they want to play around at a restaurant they can. If you're the type of person that likes nice quiet romantic settings don't go here. It's a family (with kids) restaurant.  3 things that bother me: (1) when you walk in, even though you can sit immediately at a table because it's a really small place, they have a stupid sign asking you to wait to be seated. I'm sorry but the atmosphere of this place doesn't scream high class si why are you pretending to be high class by making us wait???  (2) They don't have fountain drinks. You have to order canned or bottled drinks and they charge a lot for them. Whatever savings you have from the food will be made up for with the cost of drinks. And it's not like you can get a free refill on drinks when they are canned/bottled  (3) The best and most surprising thing about this place is that they make their own homemade nachos and they taste great. You'll instantly want more but they only brought 1 little small basket for all 4 of us to share. The basket is so small you'd think they should bring 1 for each person or at least give us a much bigger bowl of chips (enough to feed 4)  With all that being said I would recommend someone to try this place but if you have to drive more than 10 mins to get to it then it's not really worth it. We drove all the way from Henderson so it was like a 20-30 minute drive and I didn't think it was worth that.",

Free chips, Salsa, and Guac. start the meal. We usually do one dish with the tacos.  The kimchi fried rice is delicious and HUGE, with a fried egg on top. Especially after 2-3 taco's you'll definitely have leftovers. The Mongolian beef is also worth a try.  Decor needs updating as it looks old and a bit run-down on the inside..but i guess with the type of reviews they've been getting and since the food speaks for itself, I'm sure the owners could care less.  The only way to describe this place is truly with the corny albeit often used phrases:  **HIDDEN GEM** **MUST TRY** **FOODGASM** **GO-TO SPOT**  But i wouldn't write those words if they weren't True about Komex.",

Lets say more of a vigorous crunch than a nice crisp. The Spicy Pork Plate(9) was deliciously moist, sweet and tender with the perfect bite to it! Comes with a whole pot of rice too (not literally).

    "text": "Korean fusion with Mexican. What the! But wow, it's pulled off nicely. My wife and I split the meals and had a lot left over, big portions at good prices. The service was pleasant and attentive, the restaurant is small, basic, but clean. But onto the food:  The chips were delish! Not your basic thin chips. And they include guacamole at no cost.  There are three menus, Korean, Mexican, and Fusion. Fusion flautas with bulgogi meat. Heavenly. Three large flautas and seasoned guacamole & sour cream side.  Fusion Burrito. Good, not knock your socks off, but good. I'll just eat more flautas.  Bulgogi fries.....Yummy! More like nachos but with fries and Komex goodness.  All this, and a coke for $25. We'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back.",

    "text": "I FINALLY made my way to KoMex after long anticipation and boy, did it live up to its hype!   I stopped in after finding myself on \"that\" side of town and had luckily arrived ten minutes shy of their opening time. My guy and I sat in the car to wait until the clock struck 11. As we did, I noticed car, after car, after car pull into the parking lot. I kept eying the rearview mirror saying aloud, \"I wonder if they're going to KoMex...\" As I watched the first car full of people make their way towards the KoMex door, I jumped out of the car and dashed for the door (I entered first by the way).   We took our seats and browsed through the menu. While there were many items on the menu I wanted to try, we agreed that we HAD to try something off the fusion side. We decided on sharing an order of the Bulgogi fries and musubis on the side (the latter selection mainly due to the fact that I have a man from the islands). So, the place filled up within minutes of being there and while we waited, we were served homemade chips that were warm, crisp, not too salty, not too greasy. Just my style.   The fries arrived first and man, were they delicious! The mixture of flavors of everything atop the mound of goodness was perfect-- It somehow tasted as though you topped off an order of Gordon Biersch's garlic fries with perfectly cooked bulgogi. Let me tell you, it tasted better than an order of Roberto's carne asada fries after a night of intoxication. The musubis arrived shortly after and didn't disappoint. I've actually never seen them molded the way they did-- they were wider and flatter than other places usually make them.   Two things I did observe during my visit which is the only reasons why I didn't tack on that extra star: 1) As a holder of a food handler's card with lots of knowledge of food handling, I did observe one of the workers wearing the same pair of food handler's gloves the ENTIRE time I was there. The same pair was used to scoop ice, serve drinks, serve food, get items from the back, move the kitchen curtain, etc. I received a plate with a little bit of food on it as well as the drink I ordered having remnants of food that wasn't mine.  2) I should've chosen my seat differently. I sat in a position directly across from the opened gate that separates the little prep counter with the customer seating. This gave me full view of the large garbage can that I wish I hadn't had view of during my entire meal. Next time, I'll sit elsewhere.   Can't wait to return!",

I'll admit, when I walked in I was expecting to see a menu or listing of items on the wall, or even some Komex signage inside, but instead I was stuck standing at the counter looking stupid. I wondered if I was even in the right place. It is a little hole in the wall. Nobody asked if I needed help or wanted to order. Finally, after having stood at the counter for some time I asked for a menu. Everything sounded good.  I couldn't decide on the bulgogi tacos or burrito. Naturally, I went with BOTH. And, of course I couldn't leave without the chips and guacamole. The chips were the bomb! Korean BBQ AND Mexican? Freakin GENIUS!!! Komex please make your way to San Diego!  Everything was SO good. This is definitely one of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm gaga for their bulgogi!  As their name suggests, KoMex is a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant with a little Chinese and American thrown in for good measure. This is truly a hidden gem; although it's only a few blocks from my house, it's located in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station, and I didn't even know it was there until I looked for nearby restaurants on Yelp. Now it's one of our go-to places for takeout (which I heartily recommend; because of its small size, you might have to wait a bit to dine indoors).  I agree with other reviewers that their bulgogi fries are fantastic, but there's one menu combination that can't be beat: the beef chow fettuccine and pork-kimchi fried rice. We usually get a full order of the fettuccine and a half order of the rice, and the portions are so big that this will serve as two hearty meals for two hearty eaters.  The beef chow fettuccine combines their signature bulgogi beef with red cabbage, onions, peppers, and carrots, all served over thick noodles. Sounds weird, but it's the best thing on the menu (IMHO). We like the fried rice with pork -- although I think any meat would be fine -- but you HAVE to add the kimchi (and its traditional fried egg partner) to give it a little extra spice. I'm not a huge kimchi fan, but it works perfectly in this combination and is especially good when you mix the fried rice and the fettuccine together. DELISH!  This time we also each ordered a chicken lettuce wrap as an appetizer. Once again, any meat combo would do in this dish. We've tried the bulgogi and the pork belly before, but today chicken won out. Chopped chicken topped with cabbage and cilantro, all wrapped up in an iceberg lettuce leaf. You can also get these as tacos (corn or flour tortillas), but the lettuce was a refreshing change from our otherwise carb-heavy meal.  Takeout service is quick and efficient, and the counter help is always friendly and appreciative when we arrive. And you can't bet the price, especially for these huge portions: $23 for two great meals for two. Thanks to the food gods for putting KoMex so close to home!",

What can you say, it's what I came here for.  Fusion styles it was!  My taco was piled with chicken on top of chicken and my burrito stuffed with beef!  With a splash of lime and added chile/fusion and kim chee... oooo yyyuuummmmyyyy.  Nuts gathered here!  After our entrees we were given oranges and fortune cookies!

The fusion dishes are really creative and they blend together in perfect Korean-Mexican fashion. The place is not fast food, it is very high-quality food, but you still won't wait long for your meal. I think it took less than 10 minutes for all our food to come out, and we ordered a lot.  The fusion fries were my favorite, and a half order is big enough for probably 3-4 people. The pork lettuce wraps were a great appetizer, they had a little pico from the mexican side, and the meat was from the korean side. Another perfect blend. The bulgogi chimichanga was huge and delicious, and you definitely can't go wrong with this order.  I was very happy with everything I ordered and really want to go back the next time I'm in town!",

This most recent visit I brought some first-timers with me & of course I had to order the bulgogi nachos to give them a taste of this place! My friends had a fish taco, fusion enchilada plate with chicken & a fusion burrito with bulgogi. Sadly, they mixed up the meats for the burrito & enchilada. One friend got a nice surprise, the other.. not so much. Yours truly decided to order the pork belly musubi & a (yes, singular) fusion flauta. I was a little disappointed with the pork belly musubi. Two pieces took up the whole plate. I could barely hold it, so I used my fork & picked at the pieces. My fusion flauta was pretty tasty though, so I was satisfied.    I love the bulgogi nachos/fries! I'm glad that you can order half orders now. Definitely coming back when I have my next craving for them.  ..which might be soon.. :)",

Even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip, I am so glad we made it out (then again I wasn't the one driving... Thank you P!)  As per many yelpers' recommendation, we tried bulgogi nachos (with kimchi on the side), Fusion Flautas, and spicy pork kimchi fried rice.  I love Korean Mexican fusion. So. Good. We order the half size bulgogi nachos and that was plenty for the two of us. Their home made chips were great and they were not stingy with the toppings. I could eat this all day long. The flautas were also delicious. Bulgogi plus cheese rolled in flour tortillas and deep fried. What more could you ask? Gucamole you said? Yes, they come with the flautas and were fresh and excellent! We were really full already by the time the fried rice arrived at our table. I had a couple bites, but the flautas definitely had my heart. My friend though on the other hand couldn't stop eating the fried rice even though he was really full.  They also have 4 different kind of salsa. I only got to try 3 of them because I was too busy stuffing my face with everything else. The green one was alright. Not too memorable. But the other two that I tried were amazing. One of them kind of remind me of the sauce Kogi truck uses. It has a nice balance of vinegary and spiciness, except the one here has an extra kick at the end. The kick at the end is pretty strong. The other one is on the sweet side, and if I could I would steal their salsa home. Remember to grab the salsa containers when your complementary tortilla chips arrived!",

It was loaded with meat, and the torta was jammed pack with Mexican and Korean flavor. The only complaint that I had was with the musubi; it was jammed packed with rice with a thinly sliced piece of spam on the top. Make it smaller, cut out some of the rice, and a slightly thicker slice of spam, and you could still sell it for $4.",

I had a Korean bbq meat - can't really remember how to spell it but bogoli(?) which was awesome along with veggies and white rice. The flavor of the meat was excellent and the veggies were cooked perfectly, not too crisp but not too soggy. Service was a little slow but food is made to order so again a good thing.

First time ordering pork belly musubi but we always order kimchi fried rice, bulgogi nachos, combo fried rice, 2 orders of chicken wings and beef chowfun.  I didn't eat breakfast that day for some reason so I was starving. My wife started driving and I wanted to try the pork belly musubi. My first bite was heavenly. I'm so glad I ordered it but I should of ordered orders instead of 1. But one order came with 2 so it's plenty.  I first tasted the crispy fried smokey of the pork belly and it was out of this world.  It lasted about 8 minutes. My wife took a couple bites but I pretty much inhaled it. I'm gonna try it with egg next time.  The kimchi fried rice, chow fun, bulgogi nachos, 2orders of chicken wings, and regular fried rice for the kids is our goto order every time we go. Sometimes we mix in bulgogi tacos or sliders. But everything ever thing is good including the Chinese side of the menu. The wonton soup is excellent and chow fun. I have not been disappointed with the the food.  Even if we drove 25 minutes the bulgogi nachos were so tasty. If you ever had chilequiles, it reminded me of that with a twist.  I will be back, I have family in town so hopefully this week. My sisters first choice is always Komex and they drove 500 miles vegas! Thank you Komex.  Everything is subjective,  and I am not picky but I enjoy komex. Service is always excellent! !!",

We tried the pork belly musubi (good but would be better if the pork belly was cut into smaller pieces), the kimchi fried rice (Monta's is better), and the famous bulgogi fries. I think the fries need to be crunchier because it became soggy underneath everything. All the toppings were good but it just felt like something was missing. I would also suggest getting the kimchi on the side because that made everything soggy real quick.   All in all, not a rave-worthy place to visit...",

We actually went twice just to make sure we gave them a far shake.  Unfortunately, though good, we've had better.  The beef was too salty both times, and the veggies were pretty few compared to the carbs when we opted to go healthier the second time   However, the Pork belly Mitsubi was unlike anything we've ever had... a must experience.  Sadly, we really wanted to like this place... but would still recommend and have you decide for yourself.",

    "text": "After wanting to try this place, we finally got take-out saturday for lunch. Located opposite the car dealership (high school and golf course are other markers for the same side of the car dealership). You might miss it because it's in a little corner of a little strip-mall on the same side as the VCA animal hospital.   I chose the full plate of mixed fried rice- chicken, beef, & shrimp (so I could share it with my son) while my husband got the beef burrito. I had my rice with the hot sauce and it was quite tasty. The meats were very good. The beef was especially tender and sliced thin. The veggies were cooked perfectly. I guess the only thing that would likely ruin fried rice is if the rice were mushy; but no issues here. My son liked it too; I just had to cut the chicken into smaller pieces. My husband didn't think it was anything special- I had a bite of his burrito and it was pretty good to me (but I suspect he was comparing it to Truk-n-yaki). I really liked the fried rice, but I saw so many things I'd try in the future, like the nachos, torta, or the kimchi fried rice. If we were to go to the Meadows Mall in the morning, I could see getting take-out from here again.  The vast menu is split between fusion and mexican. I wanted fusion, but that's me. Hubby said that there was a huge sign on the wall, stating \"items are made to order.\" He described the inside as being larger than a hole-in-a-wall and noted there were a couple customers inside dining. The korean man at the register highly suggested the tacos and burritos for a first-timer. And hubby loves burritos.   Like I said, I wanna try other items on the menu. So, we'll be back.",

I don't recall his name but he was very attentive of us and made sure we enjoyed the Ko-Mex experience.  We had the kimchi fried rice with tofu, bulgogi fries, fish tacos, and the winner of our meal: tater tots with bulgogi! Ala carte, the kimchi fried rice and fish tacos were good. Not great, but good. They have two house sauces - one of which, the sweeter one - brought everything together when added to the meals, bringing my aforementioned \"good\" up to a wonderful! I didn't get to try the other house sauce, which they explained was spicier than the one we had, but again I can't make it past a level 4 on the spiciness scale. The tater tots were just amazing, both with and without the house sauce.  Tip: 5% off if you pay with cash!",

I can usually finish three tacos when at the restaurant and be fine without that super stuffed feeling. Or if I get something else it's usually entree (in this case flautas) + one taco. Two tacos plus something else for one person is really pushing it. Bring someone with you and share!  Fusion tacos an the flautas are by far my favorite.

    "text": "This place is A-OK for me. Komex is generally a spot I visit when I specifically have the craving, but I feel like the quality has gone down significantly since they opened. The last 3 times I visited, the meat was bland and chewy. I also use to love the kim chi fried rice because it wasn't overly sour like some other places. The last 2 times I ordered it, it tasted bland and old. Even prior to those past visits, I still would've rated this place 3 stars.     So what's up with the 2 stars? Well, we stopped in last week and tried to use Samsung Pay. I get it, it's still new so people are not familiar with it. The problem came when the owner refused to try it and began arguing with my boyfriend. I get that you don't want to use it, totally fine, but why put up such an argument. He could've just said no and asked for another form of payment rather than immediately making an issue out of it. I've always has such a pleasant experience with the owners in the past that this reaction was extremely off putting. Needless to say, we wont be back.",

    "text": "This place lives up to its reputation!  This evening, we tried 3 menu items at the Decatur location:  The Bulgogi enchiladas, seafood tacos, and Bulgogi cheesesteak (mozzarella and provolone; onions and peppers).  We all were pleasantly surprised by the house salsas and sauces, but the Bulgogi meat was easily the best part of our meal!  Everything was perfectly seasoned, piping hot, and delicious.  The fried food was good, but not as exciting as their non-fried items.  Portion sizes are adequate to generous, and pricing reflects this.  As amazing as the food was, the experience was really enhanced by the service we received tonight.  Ken was our server and explained several nuances of the dishes which newcomers will appreciate.  We felt that the staff was truly passionate about what was being served and sought absolute customer satisfaction.  (TIP:  Pay in cash and get 5% off your order total!)  This is definitely not a place to dress up for (very potent aromas will stay with you for a while), but the food and service were excellent!  If you're looking for affordable and exceptional fusion cuisine, KoMex is a must!",

It was a nice mix of Korean (the crispy rice and beef bulgogi) and Mexican (cabbage and salsa).   Next, we had the Chicken Nachos.  This dish was delicious and probably the favorite dish of the night. Layered with cheese, perfectly seasoned chicken, tomatoes and jalapenoes this dish is a must try!  One member of our group ordered the Spicy Pork Quesadilla, while another ordered the Kim Chee Fried Rice. The fried rice was spicy but delicious.   I ordered the Chicken Chow Fettucine.  It was nice, but not my favorite dish of the night.   Overall I would return. Staff is friendly, there's a lot of parking and reasonable prices.",

I had one Pork taco, which was good. Nothing too great but still good, went well with the sweet Korean sauce that was on the table. I also ordered the Bulgogi torta which was SOOOO crazy good. I could not stop raving about it. Again, went so well with the sweet Korea sauce. The prices were a tad bit high for just the Torta, would've been great if it came with a small side, but it does fill you up. Service was a bit slow since we had to wait a few minutes just to be offered water but it was busy considering there was only 1 person in the front handling the orders and tables. I would totally come back and perhaps try something new.",

    "text": "Compared to the KorMex Fusion restaurant Vatos Tacos in SOUTH KOREA, I came here with high expectations after falling in love with Korean Mexican fusion food. However, KoMex here in Las Vegas did NOT live up to its potential.   The areas I rated that lead me to the 3 Star rating was first the food, the menu selection and the ambiance of the restaurant.   The food was a hard 3 stars. The bulgogi fries were made with what looked and tasted like Grocery Store frozen thick cut fries then topped with block cheese that just hardened if not eaten right away when hot.  The Kimchi Fried rice tastes good at first but quickly looses its appeal after about four bites leaving you with a bland plain taste that makes you wish there was something to smack your taste buds out of your mouth.  I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga which was a disaster. Waaaay too much vegetables on top of the mess and little flavor on the inside to keep you going for more.   With dishes that were presented to look good the flavor was subpar. But it was ok if it's your first time trying Korean Mexican fusion however I will say this is MORE MEXICAN than Korean.   The menu selection is basically a Mexican food menu with Bulgogi and other Korean meats to choose from.  And compared to Vatos Tacos in South Korea where the restaurant shows elegance as well as style and class right when you walk in the door inviting you to not only come back for dinner but also bring a date, this KoMex restaurant seemed like the place you take your 4 person family or group to when you honestly just don't want Taco Bell and want to \"spice\" your lunch up for the day.   Solid 3 stars. Would have given it 2.5 but I don't know how to do that on yelp.",

You can taste the High quality ingredients used but adding their sweet sauce on the tacos made everything taste much more amazing. Depending on meat choice prices range $2-3 per taco, we wanted to stay and order more but we will definitely plan to return when in Vegas again!",

I got the full portion which is $10.81 after tax. I love it so much. It's a really good deal if you get half portion bc the portion is still big but it's still really good. I do think that it is a little over price for just fried rice but again, you have to pay a little more for good food.  The parking situation is a bit ridiculous bc they're in a small plaza and have to share with other ppl. I also had their bulgogi nachos. It is to die for.  I definitely recommend the fried rice and nachos if you do get anything. You can tell it's a family own restaurant which feels a little more welcoming.  Overall great place and food. Just a little overpriced but well worth it.",

We tried the chicken fried rice, tofu fried rice, the beef tacos and the bulgogi nachos. The bulgogi nachos were the stand out, but all four dishes were insanely good. Like, dream-about-them-for-days-until-you-finally-give-up-and-go-right-back-to-KoMex-again-good. Baby-friendliness rules my world and Komex definitely has it. Our waitress was super quick with a high chair, was very careful about placement of the spicy salsas (all three of which were excellent, by the way!) and even engaged my baby in sign language when she saw us signing with him. Awesome! Don't hold off any longer...and don't keep KoMex stashed in your yelp bookmarks for even one more day...just go!!:)",

I decided to play it safe and got the kimchee fried rice. It was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried my friends cheesesteak and that was pretty bomb. I'd be open to coming back to eat here again and probably be a little bit more adventurous.   The key negative here is the slow service and the fact that they take forever to bring your bill and pick up your check. Was about to give it a three but I guess I'm just in a good mood right now.",

When we got there, we waited a few minutes for someone to finish their food so we could cop their table.  We got the bulgogi fried rice, fish tacos, and bulgogi tacos. All were pretty amazing especially since I'm comparing them to Kogi. Their complimentary salsa and chips were good, too. All tasted homemade. They had all kinds of chili sauces from Chinese chili oil combo to Saracha to a Mexican brand I've never had before.  I was giggling that they had musubi on their menu.  The one major factor to this spot is that they are soooooooo far!",

We came in around 3pm and we got seated right away. We ordered the bulgogi fries, kimchi fried rice with pork and combo plate of bulgogi and spicy pork.We also got the free chips and salsa/guacamole. While we were devouring the chips, we decided to try the 4 different hot sauces that they have. One really stood out, it was like a combination of salsa and the Korean chili sauce, super yummy!   When the food came out, we killed them all fairly quickly. We were already starving by the time we came in. Kimchi fried rice was definitely the star out if the things we ordered. It was very flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. The combo plate was just ok and a tad on the dry side. Bulgogi fries was pretty good, especially with the awesome spicy sauce added to it. We ordered all small sizes because we know that we won't be able to eat all of them in full sizes. The overall experience was good, the server was nice and the food came out pretty quickly. We were in and out in less than 35 minutes! That showed how hungry we were ;)  I'd definitely come back again. The only downside is that the location is quite far from the strip.",

The menu is now pared down to Fusion, Korean, or Mexican, where it used to be more expansive. Your fusion favorites are still on the menu, and that's the real reason to go to this restaurant, anyway!  Free chips & salsa/guacamole still exists, and I love it. The guac is simple and delicious, and is a perfect appetizer.   This time I had the Fusion Enchilada Plate w/ Chicken Bulgogi ($7.50 - great pricing). Meat wrapped in fried corn tortillas topped w/ red sauce, cheese, rice, and fresh produce. Tasty and filling, but not the best item on their menu. For that I would go with...  The Fusion Burrito w/ Beef Bulgogi ($6.75). I feel like the entire restaurant revolves around the aura of this burrito. It is spicy, it is fresh, it has green and caramelized onions, pico de gallo, and cilantro in it. It is incredible. I highly recommend making use of the hot sauces they have (sweet chili and green tomatillo are my favorites). If you're looking for the True Korean-Mexican fusion experience, go with this menu item.   Sober, hungover, and anywhere in between, we'll be back!",

(And he's Vietnamese)  With that being said, he literally woke me up from my post-drunken slumber to eat some Korean/Mexican fusion for lunch. At first, I was really dreading the drive to god knows where just to eat some lunch when I could have just ordered room service and or just make the trip downstairs. But nooooo, the BF HAD to eat here for lunch!  I was kind of in a grumpy mood by the time we arrived here because we drove a good 10 minutes outside the strip to some little hole in the wall joint.  Normally, I don't mind a good hole in the wall but I think I was still drunk and super hung over. The owners are Korean and they are very kind. They're English is very fluent but I still decided to speak to them in Korean which they really appreciated and liked. They moved fast which I really liked and the owner moves in the speed of light cleaning the tables, taking orders, and delivering food. Pretty good service!  We received the menu and we ordered the musubis, tacos, and bulgogi fries. OMG. When the bulgogi fries arrived, I was in awe.  There was SO much stuff on it I just didn't even know where to begin. I dug right in and the flavors were very good! Surprisingly good! I really liked the mix of bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and the fries.  It was a first for me actually to eat bulgogi fries! I've had carne asada fries and adoba fries but no bulgogi fries! Supeerrrr good! A must get if you come!  The tacos and musubis were also delicious! The restaurant does a great job of keeping the authentic Korean flavor while putting the Mexican twist using the typical Korean ingredients. I really enjoyed eating here for lunch.  My grumpiness quickly turned into happiness because I got myself a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> lunch.

With that being said, for a great price you can eat delicious spicy pork with white rice or savory Korean/Mexican fusion tacos! I would recommend trying this place to anyone looking for a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant!",

I've heard about this place for a while and I finally got a chance to check it out.  And let me tell you, this place did not disappoint.  I can be an honest critic of Korean food, because I've been eating it since birth.  Let me first start off by saying this place is a True \"mom & pop\"/ \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurant.  I was expecting this from other reviews and what I was personally told about this place.    The place is small, very busy and crowded for lunch, and a longer wait than expected.  But the food and the prices were amazing!!!  I had the Fusion Burrito with Korean pork, Bulgogi tacos, Fish tacos, Fusion chicken tacos, the bulgogi fried rice, and the bulgogi fries.  Everything was delicious.  The chicken was very tender and the pork was excellent, but mildly spicy (I'm used to very spicy Korean pork).  But blend that Korean meat with Mexican flavor, and you have yourself savory piece of heaven in your mouth with every bite.  The portions are great for what you pay for.  The Fusion burrito is $5, and it's bigger than the carne asada burrito you get at Robertos. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who lives or is visiting Vegas.  When you do go, bring some patience with you and take it for what it is.  It's a busy \"mom & pop\" shop, with the mom running around as the only hostess, server, runner, buser, and cashier.  But the food and prices more than make up for it.",

    "text": "I had just landed at LAS and my friends picked me up at the airport. My first stop in Vegas was KOMEX.   It's in a small shopping center and has limited parking. We go inside and there are about 8-10 tables maybe?? They greet us as we enter and asked if we'd like to dine in or get carry-out. We dine in and they let us choose where we would like to sit. We sat down, looked over the menu and got chips & dip, bulgogi fries, bulgogi taco, chicken taco and kimchi fried rice wth a fried egg on top.   Everything was UHh-may-zing. bulgogi tacos came on corn tortilla with really fresh pico de gaillo type of toppings--diced tomatoes, white onions, cilantro, red and white cabbage.  We asked for hot sauce and they brought over a spice tray, which is amazing for us spicy-hot lovers. I was expecting Tobasco sauce but they came out with red chili mix sauces (total of 4 on a tray). We tried every single one of them and they aren't too spicy but they still have some kick to it and were very flavorful.  Bulgogi fries came out with fries at the bottom, topped with bulgogi and melted cheese and the usual toppings. SOOOO good. the fries weren't soggy (yet) and it came with jalapeno peppers, which was an awesome bonus. The Kimchi fried rice was spectacular. It came out a little later since they cook everything to order.  It was hot, it was spicy, kimchi was good and slighly crunchy, and it was really delicious. I highly recommend this dish.  The server was very attentive to us and everyone else there. She was really nice and checked up on us frequently. It was about 3pm when I arrived, so perhaps they weren't all THAT busy during that time.  But people came trickling in.  I saw that other people ordered burritos, which looked good from afar. Next time I visit Las Vegas, I gotta stop by here again and try the other items.",

    "text": "Being of Korean heritage with a mom who can COOK, I have insanely high standards for Korean food (especially for daeji gogi and bulgogi).  That being said, even considering my insane standards, the food at KoMex was quite good.    Food: 4 stars - Nothing is ever quite as good as mom's cooking but this place came pretty close.  I had the daeji gogi burrito and it was very yummy.  My husband ordered the chicken gogi burrito, which wasn't quite up to the par of the daeji gogi burrito but it was decent.  The real reason why the food only receives 4 stars is because the bulgogi nachos we ordered were somewhat of a disappointment.  Maybe my standards are a little too high but it was a little skimpy on the toppings and the bulgogi itself was lacking something.  Value: 5 stars - Considering that this place is in the insanely expensive city of Las Vegas, this place was a fabulous value!  Add the ginormous portions and honestly, the value for the quality and amount of food you get cannot be beaten.  Service: 4.5 stars - The service was good-ish.  Nothing to write home about but they did give us two free mini bottles of Sam's Club water so I gave them an extra star :)  To sum it up: If you are in the Vegas area and are looking for a great meal, give this place a try.  If you are a value oriented person who is looking for a great meal at a very reasonable price, this place is a must.",

I had a tofu and bean burrito, which was very good, even if it seemed light on the beans. My friend had the bulgogi burrito, which he said was excellent.   Our server was very friendly and fairly attentive, although she seemed ever so slightly annoyed that we hadn't ordered ahead of time over the phone. They have a sign there explaining that all of their meals are cooked as soon as you order it, so as to keep it fresh. This was good to know, but our order took quite a long time considering we only had burritos with no side orders or appetizers.  In summary,   Pros: -Good value -Great food -Friendly service  Cons: -If you don't order ahead of time, you'll probably be waiting a while",

Before this, I had never had Korean-Mexican fusion food, but KoMex has made me a convert!   If you eat there instead of ordering take-out, they give you free homemade chips and salsa/guacamole. The fusion items come with a choice of 3 different meats (beef, pork, or chicken), fish, shrimp, and vegetarian. Kimchi can be added on to any fusion dish if requested, but I'm not a fan of the sour element kimchi adds, I'd rather add lime. I always get the fusion tacos, burrito, nachos, or bulgogi beef fried rice. I usually prefer chicken, but there's just something about their bulgogi beef that has me coming back for more. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable (although I've noticed they recently increased their prices by a small margin). I admit I haven't tried their Asian or Mexican dishes yet, so that'll be on my list next time I go. All in all, every friend I have brought to KoMex has loved it!",

The meat is nicely marinated and chopped into the ideal size so that you get a perfect bite when you start chowing down.      Getting in and out is a breeze, but there is sometimes a wait because the place is tiny.  It's best to call your order ahead of time as it will usually take 15-20 minutes for them to prepare the food fresh!  Don't despair, the food is worth the wait.   Credit/debit will be accepted, but for orders less than something like $10 a small fee of $0.50 will be added.  (Credit card company fees really add up!)

So far, I have only tried the fusion tacos, in both beef and chicken, I personally like the beef better just because I love bulgogi xD The corn tortillas are small, but with alot of fillings. When I first looked at it, I was like, \"How am I supposed to eat this without being messy?\", but my friend was like, \"You just can't be afraid to get messy.\" And yeah, it gets messy, but once you take a bite, it's worth the mess :p  Also, I tried the bulgogi fries, the portion is huge, good enough to share with your friend if you guys are not eating anything else, and the fries... very very very good. I love these kind of fries that have toppings on top, with all the cheese, bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and other ingredients, this fries is a little spicy and a little sweet, just amazing!  I also tried the Bulgogi Tostado, but I had it when I was like full already after the 2 tacos and a little bit of fries, so I don't remember much from it, and I didn't have much of this dish. All I remember was that the rice was crispy, but a little hard. If I have another chance, I might get this again when I'm not that full.  I took another friend there, and she ordered the bulgogi burrito, she told me it was good, and after that, she drove all the way down there to get that burrito again, must be really good :)  As for the service, some people complained that the lady was unattentive, but please cut her some slack. That place is packed and she's the only one that's waitressing! When I was there and it was busy, you can tell she tried her best to keep everyone satisfied. I actually thought she is a really good waitress, nice and attentive.",

    "text": "Dayamn! I love this place. The place was a little run down and there wasn't a lot of parking but damnit I didn't come here to stay over, I came here to eat! The lady that was taking my order was extremely nice and very attentive despite being the only one in the restaurant and having at least 6 other booths to deal with she was super amazing. As for the food, I had three tacos, chicken, beef, and pork, the kimchee fried rice (huge portion even for me) AND two spam and egg musubis. I know, I'm a fat kid but don't worry I burn it off in the mornings. The tacos were good, not memorable but still did the trick. The kimchee fried rice had spam in it and was so amazing, perfect amount of spiciness and small pieces of spam so you didn't get big chunks mixed in with your rice. If you're hungry order this, it could feed at least five people or two of me, either way it's a lot of rice. Also if you're sensitive to spiciness, then you should still order this but stop off at the store and grab some Tums.   What I really gave this place extra points for is the spam musubi, wowsa this might be the best spam & egg musubi in the city so far. The rice and egg in the musubi tastes almost like a garlic-y fried rice and egg mixed in that grease and the seaweed holding it together doesn't fall apart after one bite. So perfect. Definitely a fan of this place but if you don't like spam and Korean food but only Mexican food you just might find this place as okay and then ask yourself why you went to a KoMex spot as opposed to just a Mex spot.",

    "text": "I don't know if it was the fact that I had high expectations, but this place was just OK for me. It could also be the fact that I had tried much better Korean style burritos in Los Angeles. Being Korean, I have to hold Korean BBQ meat to that standard. The meat was good, but some of the mixtures of flavors didn't do it for me.  The bulgogi burrito was pretty good. I had trouble with the taste of the bulgogi and the taste of Spanish rice. The fried kimchi helped the taste. The pork was good, but I had trouble stomaching the calamari taco that was their special that day. Although it sounded like a good idea, it was just way too bland. I think the lime (or maybe it was lemon) and the sauce was the only thing that saved the taco, but even still I didn't find anything to rave about.  The price was so cheap. Based on how full my friend were, a $15-16 bill for two people is definitely not bad at all.  The idea of the Korean and Mexican food is appealing, but some of the food just didn't complement each other for my own taste.",

The tea was perfect, hot jasmine tea, yum.  Our waitress was very nice, the wait wasn't too bad (felt worse cuz we were starving).

I came in one day with my bro and tried the Bulgogi burrito, Spam Musubi, Fish Taco and the Yelp special for some Fried Wontons. Soon the food stared to arrive but was missing the Fish Taco and the server argued that we didn't order that, but we didn't care to fight as long as it didn't show on the bill. Service was ok but kinda abrupt and semi-cheery. After trying a few other Korean Mex places I'm not sure it works for me. The sweetness of the bulgogi over powers the savory flavors in my opinion.",

Service is great, they are a truly nice family that owns the place, but the food is definitely out of this world. The nachos are a big hit but my favorite is the chimiganga with fusion beef. The flavors of the Korean beef mixed the the Mexican spices and mozzarella cheese are to die for. And the thing is HUGE..easily feeds any starving teen with a little left over for the next day.  You can't go wrong with anything you order. I've never had anything there that wasn't good. Also if you like Chinese food they have some killer Chinese dishes that you wouldn't expect from a Korean-Mexican restaurant.  Oh and if you like guacamole..don't think about ordering it..just do it! You won't regret it, you have my word. It's hands down the best guacamole I've ever had, and every single one of my friends agrees with me.  I do have one negative about this place though, and it's that they don't have a location in California! I promise you I would work there just to get paid in food!",

    "text": "5 star for quality, quantity and service. Hands down. I had the fusion taco with flour tortilla, vegetarian. My husband got the fish taco. I have to say, it was no doubt, the absolute BEST taco I ever had. Can that even be called a taco? Not for what I know as a taco. I know ground beef, or for me, ground seitan, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream. I can't even explain the wonderfullness of this taco. It was fresh, crisp,  tasty and amazingly delicious. The fresh cilantro and scallion on top of the 2 types cabbage, pico and grilled veggies' was mouth watering. My husbands' fish taco was melt in your mouth fantastic. I loved both of them. So completely different in taste, but equally delicious. My sister ordered the carne asade, which I didn't taste, but it looked really good. The service from Linda was spot on. I appreciate her coming over and asking how I'd like my vegetarian meal. Did I prefer grilled veggiee's or fresh chopped? It's so nice to get that kind of personal service. Oh, I got the torta as well. OMG! It's sticky rice that's lightly fried so it's super crunchy. I, again, got the vegetarian. But I kept thinking, if I got the teriyaki beef on this, it would be out of this world! The starter of fresh chips, guacamole and salsa was yummy. The fact is was free....priceless. I had the unsweetened ice tea, delicious, and Linda was saying since she doesnt like tap water, she doesnt serve tap water. Anyone who orders water with their meal gets bottled water, free. LOVE IT! I was extremely impressed with the menu and after eating my meal and having a few days to digest, I'm dying to try others! I can hardly think of anything bad to say, but everything has something to make better so here goes. It's location is.....to be desired. The bathrooms are....disappointing. That's it. When you get past this, you will be talking about this meal for days to come. For me, it's day 3 and I haven't shut the hell up!!! Enjoy. It will be a delightful meal that you will be telling everyone about. Me? I'll be back Saturday with friends! For the record, I am happy with my review. However, after reading, my husband feels I am harsh with the bathrooms. Here is the truth. I didn't go in. My husband and sister did and both came out saying it was kinda gross. Nothing to take away from the awesome meal, but not good. So, that is why I said what I said. There was also a 30 minute conversation on the way home about the bathrooms. My husband and sister aruging that since it's a rented place, they can't invest in making the bathroom better. They say there were as clean as they could be. Anyway, I loved this place. The bathroom has no bearing on my opinion of this place. I only pointed it out because, any place, and I mean, ANY place, can always be better.",

    "text": "I would like to thank all my Yelpmates for their wonderful reviews. If it wasn't for them I would have  no clue about this place. You know who you guys are your all on my Yelp friends list who have reviewed KoMex. You guys ROCK!  So I woke up today around 4:00pm, still a bit jet lagged from my Asia trip, and i was craving Asian food, but something different than my usual eats.  So I decided to finally check out KoMex. I was a bit reluctant to go because it is so freaking far from where I live. I checked out google maps and it told me it was going to take me 30 minutes to get there.  I decided to go anyways and give it a whirl. I texted my roommates and they too wanted to go with me.  About 25 minutes later we finally reached KoMex located on Decatur in small plaza. ( I must say DAMN! they need to open one in Henderson)  The location is a bit far but i must say i do not regret going. The HYPE about this place is True! This place is awesome!  I ordered the Bulgogi Taco and the Pork Taco which were cheap only $1.29 each.  Both tacos were to die for! They were a perfect size too!  We also decided to try the Bulgogi Nachos for $7.99. This nachos is not your typical nachos. The chips itself even taste way better than your average mexican restaurant chips and their salsa and cheese are way awesome too. The nachos was so good i highly recommend this dish while over there.  So since this place was far i decided to order more food. I figured hey might as well, I don't finish it at least I have leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast tomorrow. So i deicded to order the Kimchi fried rice with beef. I must say it was orgasmic! I'm normally not a fan of Kimchi, because it's too spicy for me. But who cares after eating KoMex's  nachos.  Overall i give this place a  5 star. Good food! Very cheap! and friendly staff.   I am looking forward to try the Bulgogi Fries on my next visit. Try now! Komex will give you the ultimate FUSION experience between Korean and Mexican!",

    "text": "Delightful. Very interesting large & diverse menu that pleased my whole family, from the finicky 7 year old (he gives KoMex \"10 stars! \"), to the grumpy teenager (\"ugh\") to the very selective wifey, who liked how clean it is despite being not new, she liked that the entire menu could be made vegetarian (tofu or veggies), she liked the hustle & competence of our waiter/host, and she liked how everybody really liked their food.  I loved all of the above, plus that I could feed my whole family of six for about $40, or about $6.50 each.  They also had half orders of everything, perfect for my 7 & 10 year old.  Without asking our host noticed that we'd not finished our plates and he brought over takeout clamshells & bags. On the ball!   Bonus Trivia: their \"tap water\" is in fact bottled water. The \"tap water\" they serve at your table in a large clear carafe is bottled. The water they use to rinse & cook the rice is bottled. The water they use to cook everything is bottled, at the insistence of the owner. My wife noticed that this made everything taste \"fresh\".  I liked that everything we ordered was more Mex, with a hint of Korean, yet I'm sure if you wanted a spicier Korean fare they would oblige, in fact Kimchee is on the menu. For example, my son's fusion nachos looked like awesome macho nachos, but the meat was marinated in Korean spices.  We will be back!",

Yes, Korean and Mexican. Marrying these bold flavors is a slam dunk of deliciousness.  We snacked on chips and salsa while we waited. Waits can be long because everything is made to order. The tasty guacamole will whet your appetite and you'll be eager to dig in when your order is up.  We had the Fusion Bulgogi Nachos and three tacos: pork, chicken, and beef with a side of stir fried kimchi.   Neither of us are too familiar with Korean dishes. So, I can't vouch for how authentic these flavors are, but they are indeed tasty.  The Nachos were ginormous and better than most you'd find in Mexican restaurants. The chips are crisp and can easily support the sweet heat mountain of toppings. This is a feast. The only complaint is that we wished the cheese was thoroughly melted.   The tacos were really great too. This visit the chicken had more flavor than the other two. I'm usually the biggest fan of pork so this was quite a surprise. The kimchi on the side was decent, but the weakest link. It just didn't pack the punch the tacos or the nachos did.   These fusion bites are good eats. It's a nice find for when you're craving something a little out of the ordinary.",

Which is Ok but  we were on an hour lunch and wouldn't have made it back if we stayed to eat as originally planned so we asked for it to go. I was excited because I had never eaten there and heard they were good and the menu I ordered from said pay with cash and save 5% and I actually had cash on me. I went to pay and the guy said he could not do the discount at this time. Why? I asked. He said it for dine in customers only. Ok but your menu doesn't say that and we would have stayed but we were already almost a 1/2 hour into lunch. I opted to pay with my card then after I had already given him a $20. He got pissed and took my card and didn't give me my $20 back until I asked for it. I asked for hot sauce he basically threw it at me. I told him this was my first time here and he certainly wasn't earning my returning business. After tasting the food I was not impressed. I will not be back. I can return with bad service for great food but not for bad service and bad food. I understand being stressed and running shit yourself I've been their but it's no excuse for rudeness.",

When I arrived at the little plaza that this place is located at, there were cops everywhere, and two guys lying face down on the sidewalk but gdammit I wanted some KoMex, I wasn't gonna let whatever was going on there stop me. I looked over the pics and reviews on Yelp before walking in and ordering (my usual routine before going to a place I don't know). I ended up getting a beef bulgogi burrito and a pork belly musubi. Portions are huge, the burrito could easily serve two people. Maybe I expected too much b/c of all the hype but my beef bulgogi burrito was just ok, very bland. The pork belly musubi was good though..but how can you go wrong with deep fried pork? I would come here again just for the pork belly musubi. Hopefully the rest of their menu is better so I can update to 4-5 stars next time I go.",

Average taco sizes. Huge portions and would have been under $30 if we didn't order a drink. Would definitely go here again, YUM!

This time we were able to try the pork tacos and they were worth the wait (when we went 2 years ago they had run out of pork).  It was spicy and delicious on the tacos.

Fusion Pork Burrito $5.99 - this was a huge burrito with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, lettuce, soy/sesame base sauce. Bulgogi & Spicy Pork combo rice plate $9.99 - the bulgogi was my favoriate, the spicy pork was my husband's favorite  I tried the pork fusion taco, others at our table had the beef fusion taco, and the calamari fusion taco.

Small, hole in the wall, no frills joint located in a small strip mall about 10 minutes west of the northern part of the strip (parking is kinda limited).

While the hubs and I didn't walk away from here all amazed we were full and it did the job.  Service was ok, since the place was full it took awhile for our server to take our order and he didn't check on us after he did.  But we did get our food quickly.  Complimentary chips and guac- good  Bulgogi fries - fries were think and crispy, yum but bulgogi not that flavorful  Fusion burrito with bulgogi- a-ok.  I've had better from the food trucks here in Cali.  Again, bulgogi not that flavorful.  Overall, good place to check out if your'e in the area, I looked around at other people's dishes and they looked good.

Their Twitter account is: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FFusionTacos&s=59f0f688801bf41a7e17fa82fd21972a688279362d81a76e8fd2175a9290fbc6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter.com/FusionTacos</a>  If you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.  From what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.  The place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)  The Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.  Overall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!  Will I return?  Absolutely!",

    "text": "This place is pretty hidden, but thank goodness for GPS, because it's literally in the corner of the plaza that it's located at. When entering inside, everything is plain, but don't expect the food to be the same way either...Well except the bulgolgi beef.  I knew exactly what I wanted when I went inside, so I went ahead and got the fusion burrito along with chicken. Once done ordering, I paid and waited for my order. They definitely take their time making your food and I'm not complaining at all.In fact, I like that, it shows that they really need to prepare their food. About 15 minutes of waiting later and my burrito was ready.   The burrito is pretty thick and like most other places, but upon taking a bite, things were a lot different. It definitely gives off the KBBQ-esque taste with the kimchi, rice, and the beef. There's a nice spiciness to it and everything was great. I was sad that the wrap fell apart though and all of the food started spilling. (Luckily, not that much fell to the floor, because I was salivating the whole time I was eating it.)  The beef is plain though and is comparable to a $10 all you can eat KBBQ, but if you're going to compare the beef with those kinds of places, have a reality check. This isn't necessarily a KBBQ restaurant now is it? It's a Korean/Mexican fusion and it does a much better job than the Kogi Taco Trucks back home in California.  The burrito also came with a fortune cookie and mine said that with every burden comes a blessing? My burden today? Finishing my burrito, but the blessing is knowing that I finally found a place I really enjoy while living in Vegas. I'll definitely come back in the future to try more of the menu, including those fries.",

    "text": "Thank you yelp software man.  'cha-ching'. This place was close to my son's soccer tournament in Las Vegas's Summerlin neighborhood. I needed a break from 'team food'. I pulled in and got 1 order each (two in each order) of spam and spam/egg. Large musubi with an 'obi' of wide nori seaweed. They were excellent and a meal unto themselves.   2 kalbi kimchi taco's were double corn tortillas fit the bill. It was more than Max and I could eat, late night back at the hotel. I would want to try their soups, if I was eating there. The hotspots and soups of Korea and Mexico go hand in hand with their use of spice and acidity (read vinegar). Next time.....  Highly recommended. Almost very table was full when I was there. The Korean gentlemen running the place does a great job! Thank you!!  Summerlin, NV and the surrounding areas have been easy to navigate - pretty community. For you futbal fans, perfect pitches!!!",

We tried the Bulgogi rice, bulgogi nachos, and the teriyaki chicken. The Korean flavors are the best! They have a Korean spicy sauce that is to die for! Not spicy! Just perfect. The only complaint would be the service. For a first timer it is a little confusing because you really don't know if you need to seat yourself or if there is a waitress. Well, we just sat down ourselves and a waitress did show up. It was busy so I understand...The food outweighs any problem with service. I would recommend this to anyone who wants good food!",

    "text": "I have been waiting for a slow day at work to make the trip for lunch as this place is not close to the office at all. I was hoping it would be worth the efforts to go this far as the reviews were all so positive.  Hole in the wall location kind of tucked in a small commercial center so pay attention when your driving by, currently there is a burnt down Jack n the Box as a landmark right across the street so use that as a landmark for the mean time. Walking in the place is small, not air conditioned and just kind of meh but given its location i dont expect to be walking into anything super posh either.  I have eaten here now twice with the first time having the tacos 2 beef and 1 chicken both the Korean style offerings and they were good but nothing super spectacular in terms of flavor coming from the meat. The flavor of these tacos came from the kimchee and slaw more so than from the meat. With the special being 3 tacos for $5 i figured its not a bad offering. The return trip i made i picked up a bulkogi (beef) burrito for the $5 and i was more impressed with that as i think the addition of more meat and less filler product you were able to take the flavor of the meat more which was not bad at all but again nothing spectacular to tell mother about but it was better than the tacos in my opinion. I do like the fact that they offer you bottled water at no extra cost that was a very nice surprise, and the sliced orange after your meal was a nice touch as well. All in all for $5 meals its certainly a place i would go back to if i was in the area but i wouldnt go terribly out of my way to come back to.",

I ordered a carne asada taco in a corn tortilla and 2 bulgogi lettuce \"wraps\". I gotta say it was yummy and very good, but I don't know if it was better than Kogi. Kogi is pretty innovative; their tacos have bulgogi and kimchi and really emphasize that Korean flavor. These lettuce wraps had pico de gallo in them, and it wasn't super reminiscent of the flavors I was expecting. The carne asada was pretty solid, no complaints there. But what's up with Vegas Mexican restaurants putting rice in their burritos?!",

A ton of delicious food (this ended up being lunch AND dinner for two people) for very little money. I even loved the hot sauce, and normally I can't take anything too spicy. A little bit of their regular hot sauce on my food was perfect. However, they said they can make the food much spicier if you ask - so it's a great place for spice-wimps like me, and spice-hounds like my boyfriend (who will pretty much eat ghost peppers and not die).

Which I have understood for years, Kenny commented how people still complain and they need to learn to call in their order and stop complaining. Then I brought my order home, calling it in about an hour before picking it up.  I had ordered the bulgogi rolls, usually 6 per order, kenny had never heard of them and had to ask the kitchen about them.  When I checked the order at home there were only 4 rolls and I had made a double order.  When I called Kenny got an attitude with me stating they don't really make them anymore and they won't again because you have franchised out.  He messed up another part of the order and really didn't care.  After eating here since you opened I hope your service doesn't go down hill just because you are opening another place....be careful.",

No beef, so I ordered the Bulgogi pork belly taco which was very tasty and fresh. Additionally, I ordered the Fusion Quesadilla w/chicken as recommended by the server. It was good but nothing real special. I think I need to go back when they have some beef, otherwise I have a hard time understanding the lofty rankings. Additionally, while the price was right the service was a bit clipped, even for a busy lunch and the buser refilling the drinks and setting the tables really didn't seem like he wanted to be there. To be clear, this would be a great spot to have in ones neighborhood, but if it's in your neighborhood, you don't need Yelp to find it. So if you're at the Cosmopolitan and thinking about getting your car out of valet or grabbing a cab up to Komex....think twice.",

    "text": "I came here very exited to try the food after work.  I walked in and I was pointed to a table to sit at my w young nice guy.  I sat where I thought I was asked to sit.  Once I sat down I was rudely moved to another table by an older guy.  The guy said \"the guy asked you to sit at that other table\", but said it with such a quick and nasty attitude.  I said sorry and moved to the other table.  At that point I really felt embarrassed and upset and felt like leaving.  I decided to stay anyways and try the food.  I ordered the bulgogi fries.  They were not what I expected.  The fries were soo soggy and the meat mushy.  I got the 1/2 order and I'm glad I did not order the full size because after eating 1/4 of this I started to feel nauseous.  I had ordered an order of the bulgogi rice to go.  My husband tried this and didn't like it.  He said it left a weird after taste and feeling in his tongue.  I hadn't even told him about the fries.  I will never go here again.  I don't know what everyone goes so crazy about and why the reviews are soo high for this place.  Nasty nasty and terrible service!!!!!",

    "text": "Komex was amazing. I went with my family and bf and we all ordered different things. We got the Kim chee fried rice, Mongolian beef, bulgogi fries and fusion burrito. All of which were amazing, the best Mongolian beef ever. The bulgogi fries was so amazing that we came back the next day only to find out that they are closed on mondays. Try this place!!!!!",
