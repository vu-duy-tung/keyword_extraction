    "text": "Truly, an unacceptable experience.  I created a Yelp account just for this place...  I'm very surprised to see all the positive feedback, but am assuming that those who happily dined here were expending their bill to their company or something similar. $$$ doesn't properly describe the cost of this place.  Try $23 for gnocchi and another $20 for sliced chicken on top of it.  How is this even possible?  Especially when the food tastes like leftover Chef Boyardee?  Oh, and they charge you for bread; that's always a blast at an Italian restaurant.  Moreover, it wasn't Italian bread, but rather some sort of mastodon pita.  There's nothing wrong with that if the bread was good, but it wasn't!  Honest to god, the prices are so unforgiving that restaurants on the strip still prove to be way cheaper.  Don't be tempted to come here unless your CEO has your bill covered...and even then, give him fair warning or he may just fire you for the cost of this incredibly lame food.",

The Big Turkey lived up to its name as it had LOTS of turkey. We decided on the potato salad for the side. It was good, but would have been better if it was less salty. We also ordered a Rice Aracini ball and french fries. The french fries were crispy and not too greasy; however the Aracini Ball was a bit of a disappointment not enough cheese and  very bland. The biggest let down of all were the desserts, especially since they looked so tempting in the display case. We ordered a cannoli and the chocolate mousse creme brulee. The cannoli shell was not crispy and flaky and the marscapone was dry. The creme brulee was ok, nothing special about it at all. Overall, the sandwiches were decent and I would go back to get more sammwiches.",

I think what I like most about this place is the location.  It's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.

The photos of Panevino is far from False advertisement. What you see, is what you get. My experience with spendy restaurants, the Maitre D's always seem arrogant, but not at Panevino. As soon as we walked in, the Maitre D's acknowledged us with a smile and greeting. Plus, they greeted my wife with \"Happy Birthday.\" They sat us at a U shaped booth with a nice view toward the Las Vegas strip. We also arrived perfect timing because the sun was setting and we had front row seats for that. Furthermore, our waiter, the waiter's assistant, and the server were also awesome. They all had an excellent balance of humor and professionalism.   Now the best part, the food. For appetizers, we ordered crispy calamari and shrimp; and crispy Maryland-style crab cakes drizzled with honey mustard dressing. The crab cakes were phenomenal, the crab melts in your mouth. The calamari and shrimp were also delicious. For our main course, my wife had an Alfredo linguini with shrimp and the shrimp had that grilled taste to it, yum! I had the homemade spinach cannelloni filled with ricotta cheese and spinach in a fresh tomato and bechamel sauce. My wife and I normally share our dishes, but the dish I ordered was so appetizing that I did not want to share it (but I did anyway). For dessert, we were full and were going to pass even though their Tiramisu sounded delicious. However, something even better and memorable occurred. Our waiter surprised my wife with a complimentary decorative dessert plate with two cannoli's, chocolate cursive writing \"Happy Birthday\" with a chocolate balloon, and a lit candle.   Thank you Panevino, you guys are awesome!",

Still, the place felt like an old vestige of a restaurant that may have already seen its prime long ago. The food was not good, other than he artesian bread, which was definitely the highlight - but at $7 for a single piece - uh, no. The salads were passable, though I really didn't care for the overly sweetened house vinaigrette. My wife wasn't a big fan of the kale/legume salad, either. It was supposed to have some sweeter type of sesame-based dressing, but instead tasted bland. Then came the shrimp cocktail. The FIRST time they brought it out to us, the pieces of shrimp were covered in a mysterious pink creme sauce which we both passed on and sent back (Flag #1: Less-than-fresh ingredients are usually covered in something unnecessary). They were brought back out sans the pink creme. The cocktail sauce looked like a dark, jarred, thick ketchup-like mixture, and tasted sweet - similar to chili sauce sold in grocery stores that comes in a plain jar with a hint of horseradish added to invoke a similar flavor to that of actual cocktail sauce. The shrimp was obviously frozen and thawed using a boiling/steaming method and had lost any flavor resembling that of fresh shrimp by the time it was served. The shrimp had that taste of a slight hint of wet dog (a byproduct of it losing all its flavor in frozen storage....not unhealthy - just unsavory by any stretch), with the slightly rubbery consistency of a hard boiled egg white. I had ordered a linguini with clams and spicy red sauce. My wife ordered the vegan meatloaf. They brought me linguini with red sauce (no clams - a mistake that actually only brought me relief after having tried the shrimp). My entree was so saturated with butter I had to send it back as well. I got it back without any butter. The sauce was canned. $20 for the pasta - and it tasted like what they would serve at a really cheap buffet at best. My wife was impressed with the meatloaf, though she didn't care for the tomato sauce either. It seems like the vegan options show potential, however it was too little to save our overall unpleasant lunch experience.   Two appetizers, two ice teas, two salads, two entrees, one piece of artesian bread...$103 later and - rest assured - we will not be returning. We've spent less on the strip and had actual fresh seafood and real cocktail sauce (not jarred). I don't do much yelping any more, but at this level of disappointment, I had to write a review.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is great for a romantic dinner or a business lunch or dinner.  It is near the offices of a lot of the slot machine manufacturers, so it is a popular business haunt of gaming industry executives.  It has a great open lounge area with comfy couches and a fireplace for a great ambiance.  Others have adequately described the great views, so I won't go into that.   Several reviews have questioned the service but I have always found it to be outstanding.  Santino is usually the Maitre D' in the evening and is gracious and sincere.  The wait staff is very professional and helpful and Robb the Wine Sommelier is outstanding (try the Dutton Goldfield Pinot Noir -- a great value at about $68).  But the star is the food.  My favorite dish is the Grigliata di Pesce - a huge mound of seafood on a moist and flavorful bed of diced potatoes and sauteed spinach.  It includes a Grilled Maine Lobster, Salmon, Shrimp, Scallops, Tuna and Chilean Sea Bass.  It is a huge amount of food and I have no idea how they do it for $38.  I have never finished it.  My second choice is the Sea Bass, that comes with very nicely prepared grilled veggies and has a subtle wine sauce that allows the fish to be the center of attention.  Very nice!  There are a lot of other great Italian dishes that are outstanding.  Mostly, I have tasted them off other people's plates because I am so impressed with the fish here.  I have had the Porcini Mushroom Risotto and it was incredible.  Another great thing about this place is that they will make off-menu items.  If you have a craving for pretty much any traditional Italian dish, they can make it.  Chicken Marsala, Chicken Parmesan -- no problem.  They will also serve a fantastic desert of fresh berries drizzled in Gran Marineri with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  Excellent!",

    "text": "PanVino is two faced.  Fortunately, they're both delicious!   PanVino's dichotomy delivers both gourmet dining inside the main restaurant and equally tasty lunch time treats at the attached Deli.  This review focuses on the main restaurant and dining area.  PanVino is snuggled comfortably outside the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip, right across form the airport on Sunset.  Expect top notch Italian fare and the feeling that the disembodied ghosts of the Rat Pack themselves may materialize to have drinks by the fireplace.    SERVICE :  To say it has \"Old Vegas\" feel sells the ambiance short. The personable experience and the attention paid to the guest isn't a gimmick.  The staff is warm, appreciative, and genuine.  You get the feeling that these people are glad you stopped in.  Expect a warm greeting, a handshake, expect to feel like you want a martini.    AMBIANCE :  PanVino has it.  In Spades.  The main dining areas are constructed of spotless tables flanked by comfortable leather booths. Awesome for a romantic one on one and equally capable of entertaining a large scale function.  The interior is well thought out with rockwork meeting up with supple leathers while ironwork twists over private dining. Windows facing the strip are canted at such a degree to give you pause.  FOOD: Italian classics at the peak of their preparation.   the Mushroom Risotto is unreal.  The Gnocci, on a whole different plane. The best Tiramisu I have had. Period.",

Our main server never introduced herself/welcomed us to the restaurant and handed us the menus in a rush.

The decor inside is really cute, and the side of the restaurant facing the airport is ALL glass - so you get some entertainment watching the airplanes.  We had a huge feast for 5 - appetizers, soups, entrees, desserts, and sodas (no alcohol) and it came out to be $250!  Luckily my company was paying, because that's a lot of money!  It would have been way less expensive if we didn't splurge on the appetizers/soups/desserts.  The entrees are large and reasonably priced.  Here's my breakdown of everything I tried:  Fritto Misto (calamari) - excellent Bruschetta Vegetariana - like classy pizza! Pappa di Pomodoro (tomato soup) - tomatoy goodness! (very thick) Farfalle alla Contadina (Bowtie Pasta with Chicken) - incredible  The sorbetto that we had for dessert was crumbly and kind of hard to share (we were reaching over for bites and dropping icy crumbs everywhere) - but was just the sweet I needed after a big carb-filled lunch!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back.  It's worth the trip off the strip.",

We were blown away by the amount of choices there were and loved how it noted in the menu if the dish had oil. Our server Tim was happy to talk about the menu with us and provided excellent service throughout the night. His pleasant demeanor and level of service really added to my special night out.   The food was fantastic!! This restaurant really understands a plant based diet and the dishes were creative and flavorful. We started with the artisan bread, which was like a giant pita, and the falafel rice balls. Both were great. The vodka sauce on the rice balls was just right. We had the Caesar salad for our salad course and it came with an oil free dressing. Amazing. Our main course was the risotto and the ricotta dumplings with tomato sauce. Both were delicious. We were so impressed with everything that came out of the kitchen. To top it all off, they sent out a birthday dessert with vegan gelato that was out of this world.   We are so excited to have a restaurant that we can go to with friends and everyone can order what they like. Well done, Panevino!!",

They gave us a private area so that we could all sit together (and hear each other). The manager sat us down immediately even though there were only 3 people there. Our group was ten and we didn't have to wait like many restaurants make us wait for half the party to arrive. I made reservations through open table which worked fine. We had separate checks since most come alone to this foodie group. There were no questions or hesitations. The best thing, the manager gave us samples of desserts to try. Yummy. Everyone wants to go back. We try to go as a group at least once a year but many go again and again. My husband wants to go back and sit in the lounge. It is very luxurious looking. I hear their happy hour is one of the best. An \"A+\" in restaurants. Don't forget to try their deli next door. Also one of the best.",

    "text": "I was initially impressed by the spread of salads in the deli case as we walked in. Variety and freshness were on point, and pricing for a pick-three salad sampler was reasonable: $8 plus upcharges for salads with meat, makes sense.  But the portions were small, and a pile of shredded lettuce was hidden under my scoops Falsely making them look like more. They were very fresh, but lacking flavor: orzo salad could use feta or something else to perk it up, quinoa was the favorite but a little plain, cucumber-tomato salad had no seasoning whatsoever, and the cherry tomato caprese scoop I got had a scant five pieces of mozzarella.  BF paid $10 for a corned beef sandwich: thick bread and meat, plain and boring, but would have been fine if the meat was good. Unfortunately it was dry as hell. For the prices and image they're setting, you'd think they'd have a good quality mustard to dress it up, right? Nope, just packets of generic-brand yellow. We tossed the other half, unable to choke through the dryness any more.  Dining room layout and decor are oddly reminiscent of a hotel breakfast bar, before you even consider the disappointing food. Staff is friendly enough. Salads are okay. But nothing here is worth the prices they're asking- and I personally steered clear of the Italian offerings they had, as they were served cafeteria-style. Did not look appealing.",

    "text": "Could have been great but fell short. My husband took my elderly parents here for an early (5:30) New Year's Eve dinner after having made the reservation 12 days earlier. Upon arrival, the restaurant wasn't yet half full (still early). We gave the hostess our name who seemed distracted and looked for our name for a while on her list. She never acknowkedged us or welcomed us. At first I thought maybe she couldn't find us on her list but she finally seated us (however unfriendly). We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant. We were practically in the kitchen! Throughout the meal, we could hear the clanging of dishes and the loud voices of the staff.  Now I take responsibility for not speaking up and asking for another table. My husband or I should have asked to be reseated but didn't want to make a scene (our bad). Now for the food: Each couple ordered a salad to split before our entrees. They don't have small dinner salads on the menu so splitting was the best option. Our server informed us that there is a split plate charge unless she brings us the extra plate to split the salads ourselves (we chose that option). However, that is a huge pet peeve of mine. Seriously? We are spending an average of $30 an entree and they are going to charge me to split a salad? Huge flag for me that spells poor management and poor customer service. On a positive note, the salads were very good. 3 in our party had pasta dishes that they liked very much. My mother asked for the gluten free pasta and they were happy to accommodate her. I had the salmon that was good but not the best I've had. It came served over cubed small potatoes that reminded me of something bought in the frozen food section of the grocery store. A nice bed of mashed potatoes would have enhanced the dish. The salmon itself was fresh but lacked seasoning. The restaurant itself is beautiful inside and and we might have been able to enjoy it if we had a different table. Bottom line, even though it wasn't the best experience, we will probably try them again. Being a local, we've been looking for a good off-strip restaurant to go to with family and friends. This has potential but simply missed the mark tonight.",

    "text": "When I think of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, Panevino always comes to mind. The ambiance, food and service has always been top notch. For me it's a special occasion kind of resto because you will pay a pretty penny but let me reassure you, they won't let you down.   It's a bit off the beaten path, when you start to see airplanes you know you're getting close. I wasn't expecting a view with my meal but the beautiful architecture throughout was definitely intended to draw your attention toward the amazing views of the strip. No wonder it made the Best of Las Vegas list for Restaurants With a View.   Among my favorite dishes were the cioppino and ravioli. As for the drinks, Lights Out (appropriately named) caught my attention because it was the first time I've seen everclear on any drink menu before. That brings me back.   The ambiance sets the mood for a lovely night out with your loved one. Dim lighting and modern decor gives such a welcoming and romantic feel. This resto has some of the best service I have ever experienced, IMO anyway. This is a huge part of why it stands out to me. Right down to cleaning the crumbs off your table & always making the right suggestions for your meal. They are very attentive but know when to check on you and when to give you some space, I love that. Nothing worse than trying to have a conversation with your date and being interrupted every 10 seconds when it's clear you don't need anything. Panevino just gets it. Well done!",

It is not loud and you can have a great conversation and the acoustics are such that no one can really eavesdrop on your conversation.    Wine list is excellent, too. Have not been here for happy hour, but I will soon.  Bar area is beautiful, elegant and understated.    The only other restaurant that comes close is Giada's at the Cromwell, which is also excellent.   If you like lasagna, do not miss it here. Home made pasta and incredible bechamel sauce.    Have fun and enjoy.  PS - have not visited the deli next door from the restaurant.",

Erik, our server, was absolutely fantastic. Friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations. As the sun went down and the lighting at our table became bothersome to me, he went out of his way to move the three of us to a more comfortable table (with three people, multiple courses, and multiple bottles of wine, this is quite inconvenient for the staff). MUCH appreciated.  The food was amazing! My favorites were the Braised Short Ribs (incredible flavor, perfectly cooked meat. Bonus - delicious bleu cheese mashed potatoes with that as well), and the Four Cheese Ravioli (we actually enjoyed this as a second appetizer course for the table to share. Fresh yummy pasta, fabulous vodka sauce).   Loved the atmosphere. Trendy, romantic, and cool vibe, but not overpowering and \"club-like\" (as some Vegas restaurants can be). Would love to have cocktails in the beautiful bar area next time as well... will definitely be back! A+!",

They reserved a window table over looking the strip, were super accommodating in sending him desserts I pre-ordered and personalized a message on the dessert. [Sadly], I have not tasted the food but my brother said everything was awesome. He had the scallops appetizer and ravioli entree and said the scallops were the best he's ever had.

I made a reservation for a different type restaurant called panivino in a different state by accident think it was this one when I arrived thinking I had a reservation made. The receptionist girl was a completely rude she basically blowed us off since had made a reservation for the wrong restaurant thinking it was this one! She was very rude and also extremely unprofessional to say the least and not get into name calling. She did not care oto ruin our special night. Her attitude towards our situation was the worst customer service I've ever received.  This will be the last time I will be attending this place ITS GOOD FOOD BUT NOT THE BEST THAT YOU CAN GET FOR YOUR MONEY. I recommend trying different places for this place will not make you feel like a valued customers.",

He was just the right amount of attentive and gently making suggestions for us.  We had a great antipasto plate and calamari.  I didn't care for the crab cakes that were ordered by our host.  My tablemates had the short rib risotto and were raving about it.  We will definitely be back!",

I had the Apple seasonal cocktail and it was very good, tasted like a strong apple juice, definitely got my tipsy on an empty stomach.  My girlfriend and I both had a glass of the house wine which was good, we aren't big wine drinkers but we enjoyed them with dinner.   We first ordered the artisan bread which was a cool, a balloon-like tortilla with Olive oil and balsamic vinegar, not your traditional bread and butter but we liked it.  I got the seafood linguini which was a good, sweet and creamy sauce. All the shell fish was perfectly cooked.   My girlfriend got the blackened shrimp fettuccini Alfredo. It was lightly dressed and very tasty.   Last we got the assorted sorbet plate, which allowed us to choose 3 ice creams. All delicious. The manager even surprised us and comped us desert, which wasn't at all necessary but greatly appreciated.  Loved this place, good service, great food, amazing view of the strip at sunset. Definitely go here!",

While the menu is Italian, I wouldn't say it's really an Italian place, but I would say this was a very nice restaurant, with great food, good service, and a great vibe!  I was actually really surprised at how nice it was inside.  I had the Ahi Tuna... seared to perfection.  My friends had pasta and both of them loved it!  We ordered a special artisan bread and that was good too!  Nothing was bad.  I guess this is somewhere to go if you want to eat like a local in Vegas, and get away from the strip.

I recommend that no matter what day of the week you go, make reservations. It is always busy. Although the restaurant is very open the noise level is not bad.

I miss the pregnant Hispanic cashier that worked here she was always so sweet and knew my order and name she had a great connection with people ... BRING HER BACK PLEASE! She seemed to always find my order and get it out to me ...And the other cashier too she was nice but always got something in my order wrong but she tries the restaurant is great but severs or bussers aren't frequent with refilling our drinks but all in all love Panevino",

Much more casual it offered a wide array of options from salads to sandwiches even some pasta selections. I had the Waldorf chicken salad and potato salad. I have to say I was very satisfied it was so delicious and fresh. The potato salad was the best I have had in Las Vegas. My boyfriend had the chicken tenders he said where best he's had in along time. I will be back! I can't wait to try the restaurant side!",

We gave them a tip when we paid thinking they would bring our food out to us especially since they were not busy as it was long past lunch and there was only two tables inside with people.  Our food was ready and instead of bringing us our food, a girl came outside to tell us our food is ready inside.   Needless to say I went in and got our food but this just did not make sense and really made me wonder what the point of tipping was for???  I know better for next time...there will be a next time because the food here is pretty darn good and not expensive so I will be back and if you have not been here for the deli, give it a try...",

Warm rich colors, dim but golden lighting (very flattering), and sensual design elements make the subliminal case for a very good night, indeed.  Our Server, Erick, was absolutely top-notch. Very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly without ever being obtrusive. Charming as heck. He's the smart buddy that you want, giving you the inside scoop on the menu and the place overall.   The food was good. ...and I mean solid good. But it wasn't surprising or overly special. There was never that moment of \"OMG, This is the best thing I ever put in my mouth\".  ...except maybe the creme brulee. Not everyone loves it - but if you are a fan (as am I) this is *exactly* what it should be. Perfectly crisp caramelized sugar topping that cracks open to reveal a truly decadent Madagascar Vanilla Bean custard. Perfection.  Having lived most of my life on the East Coast - where Italian restaurants are as ubiquitous as Mexican food is here, I would say that this place holds it's own among the better Ristorantes. Nobody will be disappointed.  ALSO: Vegan Food. Vegan Food. Vegan Food.  Also Gluten-free and organic options. Lots of them - and not just hidden away here and there - but featured in their own \"Vegetable Based\" menu. Lots of interesting descriptions. I'll definitely return just for a vegan meal.   Overall, a fantastic evening in a beautiful space featuring outstanding service and good food. I'm very happy.  BTW: Somewhere between casual and dressy. Nice slacks and shirts for guys - no tie necessary. Women can go with night-on-the-town sexy OR conservative as suits them.",

Service is outstanding (slight up-sell pressure), the food is delicious--well prepared and presented, the music is perfect for the setting, the view is to die for, and the ambiance is relaxing and classy.   Being from Indiana, I especially appreciate that they have paid homage to the classic Indiana movie, A Christmas Story, by having a HUGE replica of the Leg Lamp serving as a pillar in the center of the dining area. It's makes sense as the leg lamp was from Italy in the movie (\"fragile\").   I'd give 5-stars, but the markup on the bottles of wine is prohibitive. $55-75 for bottles that are $15 at Walmart...yes, Walmart. J. Lohr is the example I remember. So, if you're gonna get hung up on that, I guess don't come.  They'll stay busy without you. Their cocktails and wine by the glass are acceptably priced.",

The neon in the near distance is as magical as anywhere ON the We really can't say enough about this very special place-  and the man who makes it such-   Thank you Vincenzo!!!  Can't wait till the next time -   Life moments-   For a special evening or a special celebration-  they will always make you feel like you are the only table being served!!!",

The food was fantastic, we ordered the short rib on mashed potatoes, mushroom risotto, and my 8 yr old got the 4 cheese ravioli. All 3 were super delicious, as was the wine and dessert (trio and chocolate fondant cake). Really great service, beautiful view, and an easy Uber from our hotel right off the strip.",

Horrible service and the food is not even good , don't waste your money here since you're spending $70 per person you mine as well go to a decent steakhouse place.",

Perfectly executed, well seasoned, and silky texture for the tuna. Chocolate fondant cake a treat. But by 8:30 on a Friday night it appeared to be a graveyard with a staff ready to cash in. This is fine food at a fast food restaurant; what a waste of quality and view. P.S. if you can't get a window seat or facing-the-strip view, leave. You will just watch the waitstaff, or worse, have to listen to them.",

    "text": "The ambiance of this restaurant has all the makings of a very nice fine-dining experience.   Dim mood lighting, sleek restaurant design, a panoramic view of the Las Vegas Strip.    The food and the service, however, did not meet our highest expectations.   While our actual server was very hospitable, minor hiccups from the rest of the staff detracted from the experience.     Celebrating our wedding anniversary, we were greeted with a \"Congratulations on your wedding today, oops.. anniversary!\"    Our reservation note also requested for one high chair.    We waited almost 10 minutes for the table to be setup upon arrival to a nearly empty, just opening restaurant.   When we were walked to our table, two high chairs were prepared, causing more time to get the table 'reset'.    We ordered the calamari and shrimp for our appetizer.   This was probably the best of our entire meal.    My wife had a shrimp and scallop risotto which was neither impressive nor worth it's hefty price tag.    I ordered the \"assorted grilled fish\" entree which came with a side of spinach.   The lobster was prepared well but fairly small.  The scallops were a bit burnt.    The salmon was too salty to taste while I could not even stomach another darker fish on my plate.     We opted to not see a dessert menu, nor was there any anniversary dessert offering, but we were ready to check out.    The bill was high, Strip restaurant prices, for food lacking quantity or quality.    Sometimes the view is not enough worth for what you pay for.",

I've had almost everything on there and it's all super delicious. My husband (who's non-veg) loves it here and said he'd go vegan if every meal was like Panevino's meals.   Their plant-based menu is thoughtful, and not just some Gardein slop. No offense to Gardein. But, if I'm paying top dollar for a gourmet vegan meal, I'd prefer no alternative meats in my dish.

C had the Grilled & Roasted Vegetable Salad and I had the Pear & Gorgonzola Salad. We each raved about our salads (to one another). While my salad was wonderful, I found it strange that they didn't use crumbled gorgonzola, instead opting to place one solid, one inche cube of cheese on top of the salad, making it difficult to eat it with the greens. I soon pushed the cheese away, after struggling with it, and enjoyed a really nice pear salad.  ;) Really the flavor of the salad was simply divine (even without the cheese).  We shared the Lasagna Bolognese and we're glad we did. It's a very rich lasagna and more than enough to share. As it was, we were so satisfied, that dessert was impossible.  Service was good. Wine on the extensive list was somewhat expensive. We had a 2012 Tikal Parriota Malex-Bonarda blend that was quite good for fifty dollars.  Food:  4 stars Service: 4 stars Ambiance: 5 stars  Highly recommended for a romantic evening in a restaurant that is stunning by design.",

Calamari and Shrimp...fried to Golden Perfection.  Carpaccio just the way I like it, no capers.  Probably the moistest crab cakes I have ever put in my pie hole.  Also, my favorite salad in the whole wide world; Pears, Candied Walnuts and Gorgonzola Cheese mixed with Rocket (Baby Arugula) and dressed with a simple vinaigrette.  Entrees were superb!  Perfectly grilled Rib Eye served with little velvety clouds of gnocchi.  I honestly don't know how they grilled the steak so perfectly...my dining companion wanted it medium rare...and it was, but with the most savory and charcoal laden grill marks.  Four Cheese Ravioli was wonderful served dressed with a tomato cream sauce flecked with house-made italian sausage.  The Short Ribs were excellently prepared however, the Blue Cheese Mashed Potatoes were a bit over-powering in contract to the delicate succulence of the Short Ribs.  The service started out very attentive then waned as the meal was winding down.  The real shock was how the waiter plopped our PLASTIC doggie bag on the table as if to say...\"here's your leftovers, now pay the bill so I can go home.\"  Odd thing was, every other diner who had leftovers were given a branded Paper Bag and it was set either on a chair or beside one of the diners.  You'd think after shelling out $120/person not including tip our waiter would have been less cavalier in his wont for us to clear his table.  Normally, this would have resulted in a less than desirable tip however, since I plan to return here as it is only a few blocks from my house, I over-tipped.  Hoping the waiter would remember me the next time...as they say, revenge is best served cold.",

What a great place to grab a few comfortable chairs and relax with friends or just the two of us. Wait for it... SOMEONE (that better be fired by now) put up a HUGE, ugly, stupid, interior wall in the bar/lounge area and blocked the view! WTF?   Let me get my head around this: You own a place with one of the best views IN THE WORLD, literally THE WORLD and you put up an interior wall to block it? Think about this, you can only have this view if you are off of the strip AND there is nothing between you and the lights of Las Vegas Blvd. Panevino is the ONLY place on the ground floor with a view like that.   Maybe they don't care about the bar costumers and only the dinners, who knows? I do hope someone got fired for this stupid idea. We will have to settle for PTs down the road.   The food might be great and we may try it some day, but one of our regular haunts is dead to us as a cool, classy lounge.  We joke when we drive by Panevino: \"wanna stop in a look at the wall?.. Nah\".",

We decided to go here for dinner on our last night in Vegas & thankfully, we decided to dress up, we didn't know what we we're getting into, so we thought we'd cover our bases, and thank goodness we did! This is, by far, the classiest place either of us have ever been~ They offered sparkling water, an incredible wine list, a unique and delicious house salad, and the food was so beautifully dressed and all of it tasted like heaven. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful & seems like he genuinely likes what he does there. The view was a nice touch, and the atmosphere was sultry and smooth, it was an incredible place to dine. All that being said, a dew fair warnings: this place isn't for the poor. No offense of course, I myself am not a rich woman Lol, but be expected to drop a couple hundred dollars on dinner for two here, and even  more if you get some fancy wine. We expected to drop a load of money there as soon as we walked in & that was fine, but if you're not looking for a pricey meal, steer clear. Also, you'll want to dress up. Dress to the nines, it's a very fancy place & if you don't dress up you'll stick out like a sore thumb and probably catch some side eye from the other diners, although I don't believe there is any particular dress code, and I'm certain the staff wouldn't treat you poorly, it's definitely a place you'll want to show up looking your best. The sparkling water isn't free, and neither is the after dinner coffee. Try to get a Booth (or table) on the window side, as the view is a nice dinner companion. Overall though, this place was a magnificent experience & although I won't likely be back in Vegas again, I would definitely eat at panevino again & again if I could. Highly recommend.",

I have enjoyed this restaurant for so many different special occasions or even just a nice date or lunch with my family. However just recently I began eating lunch at the cafe located right next door. Wow this is such a treat.. when your pocket book isn't full enough to splurge head next door. This a treat in itself for a delicious fresh well prepared gourmet meal. For under $10 I enjoyed a divine eggplant parmesan and mixed green salad with what tasted like a homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing. They have a daily rotating lunch special and a variety of gorgeous fresh salads all displayed in the deli case. The service is counter service and you leave your plates at the tables to be bussed. The line is usually long (a sign of good food indeed) however the counter servers roll through it with ease and charm your wait is never more than 5 minutes.. The cafe is definitely held at the same high standard as the fine dining side. I recommend this place to everyone and I would suggest this place for an upscale lunch with the kiddos. They have both high tops and low tables, and beautiful views of the architecture and greenery designed by Tony Marnell.",

    "text": "It may be a depressing thing leaving the strip, especially when in search of food. You just don't feel with the in crowd anymore. Thats what it feels like when I was going to Panevino.  But you could look at it a different way. Maybe time away from all the slot machines and drunk kids playing blackjack isn't a bad thing. Panevino was nice and quiet when we got there. It's dimly light with a very elegant environment. I think the greatest thing about Panevino was the view of the strip. It really allowed you to take a step back and look at Vegas with all its bright lights and flashy decor.  Their menu is simple and not cluttered with a billion things you can order. I like that. We ordered artisan bread as a starter to feed our group. It's awesome finger food. A friend described it as 'whoopie cushion' bread. You kind of wait for it to deflate or pop it yourself...depends on your mood or how you did at the tables I guess. Then rip away.  I got their blackened chicken rigatoni. It came perfectly al dente and the pasta has such a good bite to it. Homemade. The sauce was great. I normally expect most pasta dishes with chicken in it to contain a bunch of overcooked meat. This wasn't the case...I can't stress how soft the chicken was. It's like god himself cooked it with his bare hands while he was playing the slots and drinking a brewskie. Totally worth it and very good.  Good place to go if you've grown tired of all the glitz and the glam...IF thats even possible.",

    "text": "Off the strip but not so far off that visitors would be put off, tucked away in an office park along the southernmost boundaries of McCarran Airport, Panevino is not just a restaurant but a beautiful experience.  I brought my Mom here for Las Vegas' Restaurant Week and the $50.11 prix fixe menu from which we chose the Pera e Gorgonzola salad and the Carpaccio Piccantino to start. As an additional treat to share, we ordered the Crema di Carciofi e Finocchio, an artichoke and fennel soup. For entrees, she had the Ravioli with vodka sauce and I chose the grilled salmon.  But before we discuss the food...   I did my #socialmediawhoredom thing and checked in, finding a check-in bonus on FourSquare! Every time you check in, you get a free glass of prosecco. Mom enjoyed that while I perused the wine list and talked to Gabriel, the manager and sommelier. He helped me choose a fantastic cabernet (yes, with fish! I am happy to report that Gabriel subscribes to ideas that I believe more people should also subscribe to... drink what you like, the rest will fall into place). The sauv blanc he chose for me later was a bit sweeter than the profiles I described/asked for, but it was still a fantastic wine. Gabriel knows his stuff, and he's happy to share.  OK. Foodgasm time. The soup was really good, but something, I didn't know what, seemed missing. Not to say it wasn't complex and deep and fantastic, but... something. River, our waiter, noticed I was considering the soup a bit more than most and said he knew what I needed. Returning with a pepper grinder, he cracked a generous three turns or so into the bowl... and it was PERFECT. Exactly what it needed and without detracting from the soup as it was served.  The salad was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet and peppery. The pears were perfectly poached and the cheese was so creamy and fresh that I'd question whether or not the cow was back there somewhere. Really, really done well. The carpaccio was fantastic, shaved perfectly, and had a great fresh taste to it (OK, so maybe the cow is gone now). There was certainly not enough of it on the plate. Definitely in my top five!  The ravioli was executed perfectly, the vodka and homemade sausage sauce was tangy and meaty and just a bit sweet; really excellent. I will say I had hoped, based on the description, that there would be more sausage as part of the dish. The salmon, cooked rare by request, was by and large the best restaurant salmon I have had in years. Tender and flavorful and flaky.  Mom also had a homemade bread that looked much like the food-borne love child of a pita and a sopapilla: a rolled dough, round and relatively thin, with a great rise/puff to it. That was gently treated with olive oil, wonderfully chunky sea salt, and some herbs. I tasted it with the garnish and found it didn't need the proferred oil/balsamic dipping plate.  Desserts were a strawberry napolean (flaky, creamy, sweet; fab) and a creme brulee-filled chocolate mousse... Yeah, that. Seriously the most amazing dessert I have had. Ever. Again I say \"foodgasm.\" The plates were beautifully decorated and the service was amazing.  Service. As busy as Panevino was that night (a private party in one area, a large party not far from us, and what looked like a very busy restaurant), the service was efficient, perfectly timed, and very personal. River and Gabriel know food and were generous with their time, finding out what we liked, engaging us in conversation, and making sure that everything was exactly as it was meant to be. Add to all this a fantastic view of the airport and the strip (nightime tables by the window, all the way!)... it all comes together for a great ambiance and intimate, personal, tasty experience.  Driving by Panevino last night I suggested to friends we go there for dinner.   \"Twice in a week?\" I was asked.   \"In a heartbeat.\"",

I say debate because they have a pretty big selection. Soups, sandwiches, pasta dishes, and desserts. Tons to choose from!!  I ended up with minestrone soup and the Mediterrano Salad. MY guy got the lasagna.   I have heard it can get pretty busy, but we arrived for a late lunch and it was pretty chill. It did take a minute for our food to come out, so I don't think this is the place for a \"Quick\" lunch.  The Pannevino Deli is a nice spot for a casual lunch. Good food, and a few decent wines to choose from too.",

    "text": "We had the very good fortune to be able to get in at Panevino last night, despite the fact that the city is currently swamped with all the other CES attendees looking for good food in the evenings!  Panevino is out near the airport end of the strip (south), only about 10-15 minutes from Fashion Show mall area even in heavy traffic.  Beautiful building, gorgeous intimate setting inside with a bar and lounge area with couches in addition to the restaurant area.  After we ordered our wine (2008 James Gang Zin, Paso Robles - absolutely fabulous!) we ordered the Warm Artisan bread and the Calamari & Shrimp Antonio appetizer (crispy calamari and shrimp with a side of spicy fresh tomato sauce).  Both good starts, the bread was especially interesting and outstanding - it was a huge, inflated flatbread, about the diameter of the plate the brought it on. When you poke it, it deflates & resembles a large, round pita, only it tastes much, much better - salty, yeasty goodness even if you forego the oil & vinegar dip they make for you at the table.  I will add that because we ordered the Artisan bread (which only lasted moments between 3 people), we were less full of bread than usual (is this a good thing or a bad thing?), but we were passed over for the complimentary bread basket I later noticed surrounding diners had, which I assume was complimentary (versus the $8 Artisan bread) and which I would like to have been offered nonetheless.  I started with the Pear & Gorgonzola salad: diced pears, arugula, caramelized walnuts, Gorgonzola, Belgian endive and radicchio in a lemon dressing - it was OUTSTANDING.  My compatriots both had the Caeser salad (hearts of romaine in a classic Caesar dressing, shaved parmesan cheese and homemade focaccia croutons) and both enjoyed.  I was in a vegetarian mood after all the meat we've had this week, so for my entree I chose the Agnolotti Ricotta & Spinach - homemade half-moon ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach in a creamy Parmesan sauce.  It was nothing short of divine, and I could not have enjoyed anything more. It was exactly what pasta should be, total comfort food that assures you everything is right with the world on the first bite.  My husband had the Linguini Seafood (linguini with shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine and a touch of lightly spicy tomato sauce) - I tasted it & it was very good if you prefer a tomato sauce over a wine or cream-based sauce.  Our dinner companion had the one of the off-menu specials: lobster ravioli in a vodka cream sauce, and he said it was fabulous (judging by the look of it, I'd agree!)  For dessert, we had the Panevino Trio because I thought it would be a good representation of their best desserts (the waiter agreed): it included a tasting trio of creme brulee, tiramisu, and lemon pastry cream Napoleon, all of which were to DIE for. All were perfectly executed, and a bite of each was just the right amount of dolce to end what was a very satisfying meal.  We've been here 10 days so far on this trip, and this was absolutely our best meal yet (and possibly our best meal in Vegas ever). Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in the door: friendly hostess, kind and efficient server who knew just when to show up and when to lay low, stellar cuisine, beautiful ambiance. And just like that, Panevino rose to the top of my list for MUST EATS while in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ahh Panevino. I loved the recent dinner date I had here with my man. The place was just off the strip, it wasn't that far from all the hustle and bustle. We got to the restaurant right before the sun started to set. The restaurant has these huge windows overlooking the strip, you can see how beautiful the sky looks when it transitions to night. We had a nice booth, it was comfortable to just lay back and order our food and enjoy the view of the sky. The music playing made our experience that much more enjoyable. The tables were spread out to feel like you had just enough room from your neighbors and still felt intimate enough with the person you were with. I enjoyed the atmosphere tremendously. Plus the waiters weren't always on top of you.  Apart from our bread we received, we also ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer. It was so good, it was so fresh tasting and the shrimp was so full of flavor. Probably my favorite calamari appetizer I've had. (I've had so many calamari appetizers to boot, haha) But it was delicious. For dinner I had a caesar salad, and my boyfriend had the blackened shrimp fettuccine. Both my salad and his pasta, weren't drenched in sauce and had the right amount of flavor. It was so good. We were so full from dinner, that we just sat in our booth and talked. We enjoyed the view of the strip at night time.   I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to just have a nice dinner away from the strip, who wants to spend time with their honey. Plus town square is 5 minutes away, so after dinner.. maybe take a stroll there!",

    "text": "What happens when you dine at a fairly nice restaurant when you're underdressed? In the case of Panevino you get poor service and a forgettable dining experience. A spontaneous dinner plan for my wife, kid and myself resulted in us coming here after our first few options were busy. I'll admit I looked like crap with old jeans with holes and a raggedy flannel shirt. That slightly homeless look lead to our server directing us to the back page of the wine list with all the cheap stuff with \"the items we would be comfortable with.\" I know I looked bad but I thought I looked better than the guy at the bar wearing a track suit.  The meal started out ok with two small crab cakes, breaded on the outside and topped with two delicious sauces. Dinner took a sharp turn south with the hummus rolls. It sounded interesting and even looked good. Unfortunately, it had an odd smokey flavor and an aftertaste that had me reaching for my wine and bread to cleanse my palate. My wife had the filet. Laying on a bed of mashed potatoes and smothered in a thick mushroom sauce, it wasn't the best grade of beef. For my entree I went with the short rib risotto. The deep and savory flavor of the chunks of beef were satisfying, but the grains of rice had a soft, mushy overcooked texture. Desserts were slightly better. They get points for sending out a complimentary strawberry shortcake. Two layers of light, crispy puff pastry sandwiched a layer of strawberries. We also followed it up with a chocolate souffle that came out unusually quick. Baked to order? Probably not, but the rich, dense, chocolatey dessert with chocolate ice cream wasn't bad. Any dessert overloaded with chocolate will typically get a positive reaction from me.  The place is romantic and intimate with a nice view of the airport and the Strip in the background. Unfortunately, the food wasn't on par with the atmosphere and the service made the experience even less enjoyable. If I ever return it will most likely be to eat at their cafe for lunch.",

So I was excited to try it during their Happy Hour with a group of girls.   Their Happy Hour is 50% off drinks and food on their bar menu. Not too bad of a price but I have to be honest, there are way better happy hours in this town. The atmosphere is nice and the waitress was good. From the lounge where we were sitting the view is basically just the airport, I imagine that the dining room has a better view.   I got the Blow Your Berries cocktail (rye, berries, mint and bitters) and it was good but it had too much bitters and it made it taste too strong. I also got the Eggplant & Artichoke Bruschettone, it was good but for $7 (HH price) it is a little pricy. Two pieces of grilled french bread with eggplant, artichoke, tomatoes and basil. Mmmm that's a bit much for veggies. $6 for the cocktail that's ok, I'd come back but I'm also not in a hurry to do so.",

The presentation was gorgeous. The fish flakes easily with nice white meat but there is a after taste that makes me think not really fresh. The vegetables and sauce were delectable. But otherwise, we had a pleasant experience.",

We unfortunately were not as hungry as we could be. Despite my lack of appetite I found myself eating almost all of my dinner. I had the angel hair pasta because I wanted something light. OMG, it was the best pasta I have ever had. I haven't stopped talking about it since. For something so simple, it was amazing! I would give 5 stars except I found their wine list rather limited. We did find a good Pinot but I would have thought they would have a larger selection.",

The people in my group ordered the ribeye and thoroughly enjoyed the ribeye and the gnocci.  There was a seafood linguine dish that was enjoyed as well.  As for the ambiance, the lighting was absolutely horrible and then through the dinner the light flickered and then there was dimming of the lights.  You figured they'd have the lighting figured out by now.  The service was the worst part of my visit.  When I pay this much for dinner, I expect the food to be good but I'm also expecting for some high quality service.  The place wasn't even half full so they can't even use the excuse that it was a busy night for the poor service.  1. When we first sat down, we were given a wine list and it probably took almost 20 minutes before we were given a dinner menu.  And when we were given the dinner menu, we were told about the specials in 2 sentences and no explanation of the specials.  2. I asked the waiter for if there were any bottles of syrah.  He looked absolutely clueless and pointed out the SHIRAZ rather than the SYRAH and said that's all that he knew they had.  After he left, I flipped a couple pages and found that there was a whole listing of SYRAH's.    3. The service overall was slow  4.  We complained to the manager and he seemed to give an insincere apology and I didn't get the sense that he was even really listening to us.  Needless to say, I won't be back.",

We went for my birthday and took my in-laws both Sicilian. They were both impressed and throughly satisfied. My husband and I were amazing at the plant based menu. We had the Cesar salad, the rustic tomato soup, I had the spinach \"ricotta\" ravioli and my husband had the pesto avocado risotto.

So my husband and I started with the Forbidden Fruit and Morning Buzz, both martinis were awesome, those dangerous drinks that don't taste like alcohol but will put you on your ass. The rest of the party got lovely glasses of wine.  We were also presented with a delicious complimentary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic for dipping. We shared some salads, the Andrea salad was amazing, how can a salad taste that good? For entrees we got Veal Piccata, Bone in Ribeye with Gnocchi, Assorted Griilled Fish, and the Spinach Tortellini. Everything was delicious. My husbands gnocchi was the lightest and best I have ever had. My grilled fish was simple but so good with such a variety of seafood, and I was able to switch out the potatoes it came with for some pasta. They were very accommodating. We were too stuffed for dessert unfortunately.  We will be back, it's such a great restaurant and the prices really aren't  that bad for this experience.",

Oh my goodness, the food is glorious. Nothing is over the top but everything is perfect. My colleague is a regular and mentioned that the tomato soup is the best he's ever had. I ordered a bowl and would have to agree.  For my entree, I had a special bone in Veal chop that was without a doubt one of the best Veal moments of my life. Everyone else at the table also enjoyed their entrees. It's just really really good food.  I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas. I love that Panevineo is Vegas level quality without the monotony of the strip. SO good. Even dessert (Chocolate lava cake) was categorically perfect.",

It has an inviting look that draws attention subconsciously saying, \"Eat the amazing Italian meals here!\" My friend recommended to go there during lunch because there is a deli with some great selections. I sampled the French dip, potatoe salad, and creme brulee. My co-workers ordered sandwiches, salads, and soup. They enjoyed the chicken noodle and pasta soup. My friend ordered the creme brulee first and it was so divine, I had to order one too. Nice pleasant ambiance for a work lunch outing. I would love to savor the Italian fare here for dinner sometime soon. The only issue I had was when I approached the area to order my creme brulee, the girls working saw me waiting and didn't say a word. I understand if you're in the middle of preparing meals but a \"I'll be right with you.\" would have been nice. I didn't knock off any stars because once the manager noticed she stepped right up and was very welcoming. Overall, I am glad we came here for our work lunch outing today and I look forward to trying dinner here hopefully very soon.",

    "text": "My review is for the deli side of the restaurant since I haven't had a chance to eat in the dining room yet. Since I work nearby this was a good lunch option for me recently. The location is easy to find and there is ample parking.   Inside the cafe is a bright room surrounded by windows for plenty of sunshine. Even at peak time there were plenty of clean tables. I also like that the staff clears the table at the end of the meal which gives it a slight edge over a similar option like Panera in my book. The menu board above the registers offers plenty of options including salads, sandwiches, soups, a few hot options like chicken parmesan, and desserts. If you wear glasses I'd suggest bringing them in since the board writing is fairly small.   We arrived at the peak of the lunch rush to a long line. There was a lone cashier doing his best to move the line. It took about 10-15 minutes to place our order, but once at the front we were greeted with a smile by the friendly cashier. Fortunately, it didn't take another 10-15 minutes for our orders to come up.   The Chicken Milanese sandwich was giant. Other sandwich options were normal size, but my pick was a very generous portion. Each half resembled a full size sandwich. The chicken was tasty and I liked that I was getting plenty of vegetables on the sandwich. The pesto mayo on the sandwich was tasty. The sandwich is served on a thick, crusty bread which was delicious. Even though I loved the taste of the bread I'd probably request a different kind next time. It was really hard to eat a large sandwich on hard bread. My side of Potato Salad was to my liking.   The dessert options were calling my name so I ordered the Lemon Cake. This was delicious. The cake was delicate, the lemon flavor was perfect, and the coconut flavored sauce on the plate really enhanced the other flavors.   Since I am food obsessed I didn't pay attention much to the cost of lunch, but my coworkers felt it was on the pricey side. I looked back at the menu after their comment and I think the value depends on what you order. Certain items were large portions and others came in more modest portions.  The cafe offers a punch card which they offered my coworkers. I'm not sure why, but I wasn't offered a punch card and I'm the one that will return. The cafe also allows orders to be called in for those on a time crunch!",

Driving in, this place doesn't look like much. More of a oversized bar. Next to a bunch of business building and small business hotels.   Once inside, the ambiance is immediately set. Dim lighting, very nice decor, an entire wall of two-story windows that show a clear and beautiful view of the strip! Very romantic setup. I love the music as well, a mix between chill edm, future classic, and deep house. Didn't see that coming, but it fits perfectly.  Service was great. They were very attentive and on top of everything.   It definitely was slow for a weekend. However, this place is only known by locals or when they have conventions in town. So they usually are busy on odd nights. But, it felt like we had the whole restaurant to ourselves, which I'm ok with.  Food here is amazing!  We ordered:  Fried Calamari - Bomb!  Eggplant and Mozzarella Bruschetta - Amazing!!  Scallops - Cooked perfectly  Lobster Ravioli - Bomb!  Short Rib pappardelle - Really good  Osso Bucco - Awesome!    This place has great food, service, and ambiance. Truly a hidden gem in Las Vegas!",

My wife had the vegan meat loaf topped with a unique tasty tomatoe sauce and a side of delicious risotto. So many vegan and gluten free choices here. All ingredients are fresh and if you do not see what you want or like on the menu, just tell them what you want and they will make it happen.   Drink choices was narrowed down to one of my favorites, Lemoncello! Took me back to Positano & Amalfi. The general manager Vincenzo came over to introduce himself and check in with us. Absolutely delightful gentleman who insisted we try an after dinner sparkling berry infused drink. It did not disappoint.    Our server was beyond excellent. Yes, they are on the pricier side but you really do get what you pay for. The view and overall dining experience here is top notch. I saw many patrons really dressed to impress. This place will rival any high end restuarant on the strip but the best part is not having to go to the strip. And those nightime views are awesome!   The best part of the experience is we had our dinner with the architect & chief designer of the establishment. How cool is that? Thank you Jessika! We truly enjoyed our evening with you!",

My boyfriend is a vegan (and gluten intolerant), and I am not, so it's always hard to find a dinner spot for date nights that accommodate both of our needs.   While visiting Las Vegas, we came here on a Thursday night. There was a decent amount of people eating there, but nowhere near full. We had a beautiful view where we were seated.  My boyfriend ordered the meatless meatloaf with mashed potatoes, and I ordered shrimp and scallop risotto. We loved our food! So delicious!  Our waiter, Michael was always checking on us and was so kind, charming, and friendly.  We are definitely coming back here our next trip to Vegas!",

Plus the food was great.  Not the cheapest place in town but definitely worth every penny.  Thanks for everything and going the extra-mile. We left 25% tip and they deserve more.

We were not the ones dining there last night, but some friends of ours were celebrating a special occasion and we wanted to surprise them with a round of drinks. Mark Lopez, the Assistant GM, responded to my request and beginning to end was just wonderful. Mark helped ensure my wishes happened and even followed up with me at the end of the night to let me know how our friends' experience was. I'm a stickler for customer service, and it takes a lot to truly wow me. I have to say, this whole experience wowed me!! Panevino has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced and I'd like to truly thank Mark for making both my experience, and our friends, truly memorable.",

What's great is that if you are wearing dark pants/skirt, they ask if you'd like a black napkin upon seating you (which I think is very considerate so that you don't leave with white fuzz when you're done).   Service: A+ Very courteous and professional   Food: A+ Good size portions so that you can eat 1/2 now and take 1/2 home for lunch/dinner the next day. I had the penne with eggplant, sun dried tomatoes... and it was GREAT. Light but filling so that I took 1/2 home. My companions ordered the veal special and the risotto... both of which were very good. (I like to sample everyone's food if they let me. LOL!)   Wine Menu: A+ Good selection.   Ambiance: Very nice.... It's \"street level\" ... meaning that you are not elevated.... but you do have a really good panoramic view of the airport and strip... so you can watch the planes land while the strip lights glitter in the background.   Good for business meetings: Yes. They managed around us and our stuff....and refreshed drinks without interrupting us which I couldn't figure out how they did that (of course, I wasn't paying attention either).   Will be going back when the opportunity arises.",

    "text": "Breaking news kids! Panevino has a vegan menu....2 items only but still...it's a start!  Panevino has been a staple of ours when we've felt like having a meal at a nice Italian restaurant that offers us vegetarian options, a nice ambiance and not dealing with the craziness of the strip. As per what we've known to be customary, Panevino delivered this time again.   The restaurant is elegant - dark. slightly dressy, a great view of the Strip and the airport and impeccable service.   I ordered the vegan tortellini - made in the restaurant 100%, the shells were stuffed with some kind of tofu mix and all sorts of veggie goodness! Asparagus tips scattered the plate in a rich tomato sauce. A +!  Husband ordered the second veggie dish - the veggie burger. Yes, I yawned when he placed the order but DANG is that thing good. The patty itself is made in-house with a mix of veggies, potatoes and breadcrumbs. Yummers. Served with the BEST grilled veggies (asparagus and an insane roasted potato) and a vegetable broth based dipping sauce (french dip dreams perhaps?)...this was one solid burger. If I'm in the mood for a veggie burger...I'll probably head here the next time I'm back in Vegas.   Our friends ordered the halibut which apparently was so fresh and crazy delicious. The lemon chicken was also quite delicious I hear.   Prices are a little steep - approx 25 dollars for each veggie dish and 30-35 for the fish/poultry.   Panevino is a dependable staple for a non-strip but centrally located pleasant Italian dining experience.   With the vegan additions (I hope they multiply the menu options), Panevino came through for me in a big way this time!",

It was still very bright outside, but once we got inside it felt like night had fallen. The interior is pretty intimate with dim lighting and artistic architecture.  We were greeted at the bar by the friendly bartender right away. There were only two other people at the bar and they seemed to be regulars, which was a good sign. The bartender gave us a rundown of all their happy hour specials and pulled out a special Halloween cocktail menu (themed cocktails FTW). I decided to go with the Arachnophobia and Don got Child's Play. It took a while to make, but I didn't care because the cocktails looked so cool! My ultra blue drink was topped with black spiders and cotton candy that literally just arrived from It's Sugar. Some guy sitting on the other end of the bar even came up to me and asked if he could take a picture of my drink! Don's drink was pretty strong, which he enjoyed. It had crushed Fruity Pebbles around the rim of his martini glass and a creepy eyeball just floating around (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FUpRyw9XAlGNrKNqyZGUNHA%2Fl.jpg&s=de859a27182c27a3132aed1fa24ddbf6f769cd62936b8d32d7a5b89d8a4a3997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>). If I had the time, I probably would've ordered another Arachnophobia because it was so tasty and not overly strong. The cotton candy made it all the more fun!  The great cocktails combined with the very friendly service makes me a fan of Panevino. I can't wait to come here for a sit down dinner!",

It is easily accessible with convenient parking minus the madness of tourists.  I've been to Panevino numerous times and have always had a 5-star experience in terms of food, service, and overall experience, other than on New Year's eve e few years ago.  I'm going to stick with a 5-star rating because of their standard performance, which has always been consistent all but the one time on New Year's eve.  Their wine list is extensive and their sommelier is very knowledgeable and polite.  The best bottle of chardonnay I have ever laid lips upon was at Panevino, granted it was upwards of $500/bottle, but hey, when you have a date trying excruciatingly hard to impress, take advantage;)  I can't speak for all of their entrees but the salmon and the rib-eye are grilled to perfection.  The caprese salad is worth mentioning as well.  Overall, I romantic date spot with a great view and perfect food.  You will pay for it but no more (and in many cases much less) than some of the high end places on the strip but you also don't get the hassle of the strip or the touristy crowd, which is an extra bonus, in my opinion.",

We came here for their lunch sandwiches. I ordered a wonderful pastrami sandwich. It was quite large with plenty of meat and very filling. The pastrami was flavorful and the sandwich itself was juicy. Add chips and a drink and it was all under $10.   They carry all kinds of other sandwiches, desserts, salads, and hot meals. We didn't get to see the dinner room, but they have a restaurant area as well. The parking lot is quite large so that should be no problem at all.

For what you get, items should all be under $10. We had the tomato soup (only decent thing we had but tastes like olive garden tomato sauce), veggie burger, and ravioli. Will not be returning. The crazy thing is that this place is priced the same as the hotels and the hotel food is decades above this selection. Save your money and go to the Encore.",

    "text": "I have to say, I was beyond disappointed coming back here. In 7 years, the food has gone completely downhill and the prices have skyrocketed.  Came on a Saturday night, around 9p. We were starving, btw, so at that point even the table looked appetizing. The place was totally DEAD! 9p...Saturday night...VEGAS!? Even for being a little late and off the strip, this is a huge sign that the place isn't doing well.   Absolutely gorgeous ambiance. Greeted by a very sweet gentleman; he claimed to be the sommelier (but he was also playing host.. Hmm.. Another sign?) Sat at a very comfortable booth facing the large windows with a beautiful view. Reminded me of Top of the World at the Stratosphere (without the spinning).  The waiter came to greet us, told us about a few specials and that they were out of quite a few items. Together we ordered two Caesar salads, one cup of soup, the shrimp and scallop ravioli and two glasses of wine (Grand total, $103).  Salads came out freezing cold, we were not offered fresh ground pepper, had to ask TWICE, because the salads came out at different times. I've had a better Caesar in a plastic to-go container at an airport. Cheap, shitty lettuce and thick, super mayonnaise-y dressing. I was so unimpressed with the ravioli; it tasted like something you'd get at the Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. With a $30 price tag! Are they out of their damn minds?!  I recommend going somewhere else for dinner. There are SOOO many fantastic restaurants in Vegas, and if you're going to spend that much, you may as well enjoy it.",

The other night I tried the braised beef short ribs. They were absolutely amazing. I've been dreaming about them every since. Boneless and completely melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes. $31  My roommate had the lemon chicken and of course I had to try a bite Very moist and tender, really good. $29 he also often orders the risotto $28-$30.  The huge standout was the Caprese Martini, yes I said that right. CAPRESE MARTINI. Holy goodness it was good. It's only a seasonal drink, but I'm hoping that it sticks around for a little while. It's a little steep at $11 but oh so worth it.  In the past I've had the Blackend Chicken  Rigatoni $28 and a super yummy Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli $27. Everything is always amazing.   They also have an excellent Happy Hour from 4pm to 7pm Drinks are half price in the bar!!! There's also a special HH Food menu.   This is a great place for date night or taking a group of friends for a nice dinner. A huge wall of windows, shows off  a nice view of the LV skyline There's also pretty large private dining room and a nice chef's table.   I can't say enough about how much I love this place!!",

At the end the General Manager came by and spoke to us at length. Filled with tons of great information and really was passionate about the vegan menu they offered alongside their other food. For sure will eat there again.",

By having the most bland beef I've ever tasted. The potatoes were better seasoned (with a hint of rosemary: yum). For the price you have better options in town.

Now, let's all forget that part and think of music from Kaskade, Imogen Heap, Telepopmusik -which was the awesome soundtrack for my dinner. Anyway, our group went here for a celebration.  The view of The Strip from this restaurant was nice.  I was watching planes take-off and land...I'm easily amused! It took a while before anybody gave us the menu.  Cioppino: Losbter, salmon, shrimp, mussels, scallops, tuna, sea bass in tomato broth. Great fresh taste without having a briny feel/taste. 4/5  Short Rib Risotto: In red wine sauce and parmesan cheese. Risotto was perfectly cooked and the short rib was very tender. 4/5  Pear and Gorgonzola Salad: One of the best tasting salads I've had with no meat in it. I normally feel like I'm being punished when I eat a salad but this one was pretty enjoyable. It has mandarin orange pieces, pear, arugula, walnuts, endive, Gorgonzola cheese, radicchio with lemon dressing. 4/5  Chocolate Souffle: Comes with chocolate gelato. Well-executed souffle with a runny center. 4/5  Panevino Trio: Creme brulee, tiramisu and lemon pastry cream napoleon. A nice dessert sampler. However, the tiramisu and creme brulee were just marginal. 3.5/5  Apple Bread Cake: Apple bread cake with apple-cinnamon raisin sauce. Nice, warm and tasty. 4/5",

My boyfriend of 5 years had proposed to me shortly after entering the restaurant, and the staff made our night so memorable and amazing. The manager had started us off with some complimentary fluffy bread that was filled with air. It was absolutely delicious and had tons of flavor for bread. We started off with some crostini for an appetizer, and then for dinner I got the plant based raviolis and my (now) fiance got the chicken. Our server was so kind and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Another manager took the time to ask how I became plant based, and let it be known to me that he intends to expand the plant based menu. For dessert, they were kind enough to bring out a beautiful tray of desserts, and sparkling moscato. They also took our picture. I cannot express how much it means to me to be treated to exceptionally from the entire staff. Not to mention the food was beyond exceptional. Everything was hot, had tons of flavor, and came out fast. This is officially our new favorite place to eat, and we will definitely be eating here many times to come. Thank you so much Panevino and staff for an amazing dinner!",

I ordered the Warm Artisan Bread.  We were nicely surprised when it came.  Didn't even take a pic and dug in.  It was so good.  I ordered the Artichokes & Zucchini.  That was just ok in my opinion.  I ordered the 'Ricotta' and Spinach Dumplings for dinner with vodka sauce.  That was yummy.  Hubby ordered the 'Ricotta' and Spinach Ravioli and the Pasta Fagioli soup.  Both were delicious.   My father-in-law ordered the special salad that they offered that night and his wife ordered Blackened Shrimp with pasta.  They both like it also.  For desserts, we both ordered the Chocolate Gelato & Warm Almond Milk.  Really good and it was decorated really fancy.  I am really impressed!  The atmosphere is posh.  The service was outstanding.  It is just like dining in a cruise ship.  Pretty formal.  We will be back when we are in town, for sure.",

They have updated their menu since I was last time, and there is a full section on the menu dedicated to vegetarian/vegan/gluten free from appetizers through desserts.  We all had wonderful meals and I was over the moon with my organic \"Meatloaf\"  (which was mixed legume, wild mushroom and herb \"meatloaf\" on a bed of garlic and rosemary mashed potatoes in a fresh tomato and Kalamata olive sauce). It was absolutely delicious! The setting is very nice, especially during the evening hours to watch the airplanes taking off & landing at McCarran Int'l Airport. Service was exceptional from start to finish. I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Well, at least there wasn't a cigarette butt in my salad. And, that's as kind as I can get with this place. I'd hoped to avoid the poor service and tourist-gouging prices of restaurants on the Strip, but found this place lacking in a number of key areas. For starters, we were kept waiting at our table for 10 minuets before our harried server arrived to greet us. Not even our water glasses has been filled (no busboys?). The lethargic service continued throughout the evening.   At this point we'd had enough time to memorize the unimaginative menu and placed our wine and food orders.  I was surprised that the salads arrived well before the wine and that the wine server (ah, the busboy) appeared to have never used a corkscrew before and mangled the cork while struggling with his attempt to remove it. The WORST part, however, was that the $75 bottle of Chianti was served ice cold. When I called attention to this, our server was smart enough to send over the manager who explained they kept it this way because of the extreme temperatures in Las Vegas. That might fly in the summer, but I visited in mid-November and it was 66 degrees outside. To his credit he offers to decant the remaining few ounces of the bottle, but the damage was done and basically a potentially decent bottle of wine tasted like chilled Welch's Grape Juice. No other apologies were offered.   I'll note that our pasta entrees were okay, but hardly worth $29 for lasagne. The total for wine, two salads and three pasta dishes was a whopping $225 (pre-tip). All I can say is that that money would have been better spent on a better meal and better service any one of this town's better restaurants.",

After my most recent visit, I will never visit this restaurant again.  I guess they take the \"Panevino\" label quite literally, and you must order food AND wine. If you don't want wine, the waitstaff will scoff at you and mock you for being cheap. That's right: the waitstaff will judge you for what you order. I didn't realize that I had to get the most expensive dishes or whatever else they had in mind for me; I thought I could just order items that I wanted. I guess not.  The food was very good, and the atmosphere is nice, but the condescending waitstaff has no place treating customers with disrespect just because the customers aren't interested in drinking wine. It's unacceptable. Everyone felt uncomfortable and pressured, and it is not appreciated. Vegas is a vacation town, and this was the worst experience of the vacation. I will not be back, ever.",

    "text": "I can't say enough about this restaurant.  While the menu is Italian, they recognize that sometimes vegans enjoy a night out and have a special menu for such persons.  The vegan options were introduced to the dining room over a year ago and I have made an effor to try all of the dishes.  On Friday I had the Barley & Mushroom Soup for an appetizer and followed it with the Roasted Vegetable Tortellini for an entree.  The soup was a perfect appetizer size and served hot.  It was a little salty which might be too intense for some people but I enjoyed it.  The homemade tortellinis were served with a fresh marinara sauce and asparagus spears.  It too was served hot and seasoned perfectly.    My husband didn't see his favorite dish on the menu (Roasted Vegetable Pasta Primavera) but that wasn't a problem.  We asked the waiter if he could inquire about the chef making the dish for him.  It must have tasted great because there wasn't one noodle left on his plate.  Our two friends are both carnivors and one enjoyed a steak dinner and the other their seafood platter.  They raved about how great and fresh everything was.    The staff members are all very friendly, attentive and professional.    Every person that comes to visit us from out of town is treated to a meal at this restaurant and everyone leaves after enjoying a 5 star experience.",

I dine in or take out on an almost daily basis and have converted my entire office into fans. Their Italian/American delights are always delectable so regardless  of your selection (pastas, sandwiches, salads, etc), you cannot go wrong- everything is simply delicious! While the price point is a bit above average, their tasty international menu, pleasant atmosphere and consistently excellent service will keep you coming back. Speaking of excellent service, I would be reticent not to acknowledge the extraordinary personal service I've regularly received from Justin.  The guy makes every guest feel like a v.i.p. and my entire staff loves him. He greets with a smile, negotiates unruly crowds of hungry worker bees with ease, goes out of his way to acknowledge regular guests by name and generally takes tremendous pride in his vocation- a refreshing rarity these days. For these reasons and more, Panevino is a personal favorite and if you're in the McCarran Airport/ south strip area... drop in and try a bite, you'll taste why.",

Took my family here (large group) to celebrate a special occasion and we had a variety of items from the halibut to the rib eye (as some, but not all, of the family definitely took advantage, LOL). Yup, quality was just okay, like the halibut was overcooked & dry, risotto was actually subpar to my standards, pasta was good, but to be honest, had better food at much cheaper chain restaurants, which is kinda sad! The location has great views and a pretty decent wine selection, so maybe I'd just recommend this place for happy hour or if you need to dine somewhere near the airport?

I am sure glad I have this place the benefit of doubt because let me tell you this was probably some of the best authentic Italian food I have had in a while! When we arrived we thouight they were closed due to there being like maybe only 5 cars in the parking lot on a Friday night! Made reservations on Open Table and was seated right away! The service was above par! Everyone working was very attentive and our waiter was very good! It's a bit dark in there though but it works for a romantic setting type. We started out with to die for crab cakes ($20) a little steep on the price but I enjoyed them so much so I guess it was okay! He gave a recommendation of the Veal Ossobuco ($46) ! Man it fell right off the bone! We also had the Blackened Chicken Rigatoni ($26) for an entree another slam dunk! Very flavorful and chicken cooked to perfection. Overall I would recommend this restuarant to anyone!",

And as for the staff if you ever wander what royalty feels like- well Gustavo was my waitor and I couldn't tell if he was a wait person or butler this man and his staff was there hand and foot takin care of all our needs, now for the food, wow I'm at a loss for words really um-I'm by no means a food critic nor do I have an extensive palate but-elegant? Maybe the word, much more than amazing, definatly mouth watering let me just end this by sayin I'm a simple guy from Georgia, who in the big city, likes treating his wife/mommy to be, as well as I can, she deserves it for putting up with me.

I was taken aback on the fine dining Italian, I assumed it was mom and pop. It's clean, has ample parking, beautiful view, great for events, awesome happy hour specials and the manager is circling around constantly for anyone's needs. The lighting and music selection make it incredibly romantic.  It is a little pricey but when you want to go somewhere nice and you have someone with dietary restrictions - this is a place that can accommodate everyone. Very impressive plant based menu. Most chefs are intimidated by doing something along these lines and they kept it classic, simple and tasty. I never regretted not ordering the meat dish. Yum. All of the dishes that came out were made with attention and care. You can tell someone took their time on the food because nothing is rushed. Plenty of desserts to choose from. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again.",

When the hostess asked if we wanted a table to booth, I said booth and we were sat at a table.  Ok.  No big deal.  I assume maybe she didn't hear me.  Then after our water was poured she asked if we could move to a booth since a 'regular' was coming in and wanted that table.  Again, no big deal since we wanted a booth to begin with.  We were there for a while and no one sat at the table we were moved from.  I think these things only happen to me.  Moving on...  I had ordered the Chicken and Asparagus Risotto.  I love risotto.  Their dinner portion is quite small comparatively.  I think they could have made this a bit more flavorful as well but it was ok.   My husband ordered the Lasagna  Bolognese.  It was delicious and put my meal to shame.  The flavor from the Italian Sausage was bursting.  I only had one bite but would be sure to order that next time.    We had good and attentive service.  The dining area is dimly lit for dinner making a great ambiance.   Im hoping the curse will be broken for my next visit.",

Three was a short line so we had some time to browse the large selection of sandwiches, soups and salads. After ordering you sit down and they call your number when its ready, not sure why they can't just deliver to your table?   We ordered the chicken club and the tuna melt, both with potato salad. It took quite a while for the food to be ready and it wasn't that busy. The tuna melt was awful, it was really fishy and obviously not albacore tuna. It tasted like the cheap chunk tuna in cans and the bread was quite hard. It also had a really thick cut slice of tomato that I didn't care for.   The bread of the chicken club was also hard. The sandwich was better than the tuna melt but still fell short of our expectations. The one thing we did like was the potato salad so that saved a one star rating. I really hope the actual restaurant is far better than the deli as I would still like to come back and try it some day. As far as the deli, no reason to return.",

My date and I were putting our heads together trying to find a mutual place to eat that we would both enjoy since I recently became vegan and he's a big time steak and potatoes kind of guy. Panacea was an instant mutual agreement. They have a fabulous vegan menu along with their normal upscale Italian style dishes.   To my surprise the vegan options looked so delicious my date decided to get the vegan dishes as well.   Here's what we ordered and EVERYTHING was delish:  - Eggplant & Artichoke Bruschettone - Caesar - Grilled Vegetable Lasagna - Organic Pesto & Mushroom Risotto  I HIGHLY recommend this place for a romantic night out or even a casual girls night out. Even the vegan dessert (pudding) was mouth-watering.",

A nice place for a sit down lunch but if you don't want to spend $20ish on an entree, head to the deli cafe located next door. Service was quick and empty plates were quickly cleared. Bread was brought to the table that wasn't warm but fresh and served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Asking for separate checks threw the waiter for a loop as the lunch crowd arrived so make sure to ask for this when placing your order. It took us over 10 mins just to pay.",

I was astounded by the amount of options this menu contained, especially as I know, that it is difficult to make Italian food vegan. However, the cherry on top of the incredible experience was meeting the passionate and charismatic General Manager, Vincenzo. We were able to speak with him about our excitement regarding the menu and he let us know that he crafted it! Vincenzo is a certified starch-solution and plant-based expert! Starch solution is high-carb veganism with minimal oil. He was able to describe the menu items to us and let us know the intricacies of creating each item in the healthiest way possible. I would have to say the coolest part of his personal and informational talk with us was that my family members who weren't vegan were able to hear Vincenzo's educated and passionate opinions on plant-based living. It was so eye-opening and my family felt truly inspired by his passion.  First course: Plant-Based Caesar Salad (INCREDIBLE) Second Course: Vincenzo Ravioli (PERFECTION) Dessert: Vegan gelato & vegan pudding (GET THE PUDDING)",

I had the pleasure of recently coming here for my company's party and I have to say I was quite impressed. The set up was great! We had our own private room along with a separate entrance and side bar. The perfect setting for easily socializing.  As for food we had a set menu which started off with a crab cake appetizer. These honestly were some of the best crab cakes I've ever tasted. Next up was a house salad, very simple and tasty. For an entree we had a choice of chicken, steak, salmon or spinach cannelloni. I went with the steak which had a great flavor to it, but unfortunately it was too overcooked for me. The side of potatoes though, man those were good. To top things off for dessert we had tiramisu. A perfect ending to a delicious meal.   Gotta love a well cooked meal complements of yours bosses! ''Tis the season!",

I came across this Italian restaurant who I seen had a pretty decent looking Plant Based Menu.   We came here on Dec. 18th for my brothers birthday.  It's definitely a beautiful place for a birthday. I'd suggest to go when it's dark out so you can see the lights of the strip. They have a great view of the strip from almost every seat.  & The service was good!!!  As far as the food goes, my husband and I ordered from the Plant Based Menu.  And parents got otherwise (in photos.)   I really enjoyed the bruschetta! That was my favorite appetizer.   The other food I ordered I got weren't worth the price in my opinion. Including my entree. I ordered the Vegetable Lasagna. No where on the description of the dish did it say \"Gluten Free.\" There was no pasta in it!!!!   Although, It did say \"Low Oil,\" which indeed it was. The dish over all was lacking in flavor, sauce, and should've had the traditional marinara sauce and at least a few layers of pasta. It was very bland. I was pretty upset about this.  But I would try to come back to try something else.  They had a lot to choose from!",

I found this place because I'm vegan and I saw that they offered a separate plant based menu. I had no idea that my experience would far out weigh my expectations. Visiting Vegas it isn't always easy to find good vegan fare. But Panevino hits on all cylinders.   The Wynn has plenty of vegan options, but what it's missing is the passion behind it. That's where Vincenzo comes in, the general manager at Panevino. He is Italian from Italy, educated, hospitable, charming, and vegan for 8 years. That's where the passion at this restaurant comes from.   He is the person behind the in depth, delicious plant based menu. Created by a vegan for vegans. Trust me there's a huge difference between a restaurant just service plant based food vs. someone who really cares about the difference it's making. That's Vincenzo. He said to us \"I want your experience to be like you're at home\" and he delivers on that promise 10 fold. Plus we enjoyed our conversation with Vincenzo as much as we enjoyed the food and service.   Our server Michael was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations.    I will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas and I suggest you do yourself the favor and drive a little bit off the strip to try the truly best restaurant in Las Vegas.   Vegan or not there's something for everyone. Thank you guys so much!",

Clientele is higher end the venue gives you that romantic feel with large, high windows with great views of the strip.  Panevino is 5 stars all the way for venue.  We went for Happy Hour but also shared an entree from the main menu. Happy Hour includes about 10 dishes which are discounted appetizers off the main menu.  They also have about 10 wines at $7 each.  The main menu is very extensive with both a plant and non-plant version of homey Italian dishes.  Prices are astronomical though with an average pasta dish unbelievably close to $30.  Appetizers are around $16 as well.  The Happy Hour trizza, salad, and fish tacos were fine for the price of about $6-8, but didn't seem worthy of the venue.  The fish tacos were a bit cold, the salad was basic, while the trizza was the standout with cheese, pepperoni, and spinach/mushroom varieties.  Quality was just average and seemed more of a neighborhood variety.  The spinach ravioli came with about 5 raviolis.  They were fine and unique with a walnut filling and spinach cover, but for $5 a ravioli, not worth it at all.  The bar area is well worth a visit alone.  Come during Happy Hour and get a quality drink for a good price between 5:00pm and 7:00pm.  Happy Hour and venue 5 stars.  Restaurant itself probably falls around 3.5-4 stars.",

I give this place 3 1/2 stars for the simple fact that it's a healthy alternative and the amount of options they offer when I comes to salads and sandwiches. Some of the sandwiches are more plain than others but they will prepare anything pretty much how you like it. It tends to get busy during lunch hours but nothing crazy. Just know if you are on a time crunch at 12 to be back 1 you might have to wait a little so keep that in mind. I enjoy the pastrami sandwich and the French dip. They are nothing special but I like to mix and match them with a orzo or lentil salad and a chicken noodle soup.",

I met a friend for dinner and was little early so got a Moscow Mule at the bar. It was made perfectly. We were seated quickly and ordered Calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was crispy and seasoned perfectly. I also loved how it comes with shrimp.  I ordered the short rib risotto and it was amazing. It came with a tomato based sauce with thick chunks of short rib that was so tender it just melts in your mouth. This dish was just perfect. My friend ordered the sea bass special and that too was so delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked and flaked nicely with a buttery smooth taste. One of the best sea bass dishes I've ever tasted.   We ordered the Tiramasu for dessert with port wine even though we were stuffed! It too was delicious and went perfectly with the wine.  Our server was amazing. He never rushed us and was always attentive but not obtrusive. We took a bit of time on the calamari but he made sure not to bring out entrees until we were done and it had been removed from the table, and yet our entrees were still perfectly cooked and hot. Can't wait to go back and eat more delicious food!",

    "text": "This is the kind of place to add to your \"favorites list\", visit, and ask your yourself, \"Why don't I come here more often?\"  Why indeed. The view is beautiful and if you have lunch here, you will get to look out on the east potion of the Valley through huge floor to ceiling windows.   FOOD: the food is very tasty here. They focus on Italian food and take the time to ensure the pasta, sauces, side dishes are cooked properly and seasoned well. They care about quality at Panevino. There are times I find the dishes to heavy (you know I'm talking to you short rib risotto), but it's better than solid. It's very good.   The lunch menu caters to nearby businessmen but they are willing to make you something off of the dinner menu if you ask.   VEGETARIANS MOUNT UP: Do those on a plant-based diet know about this place? Because they have one of the most interesting, delicious, and extensive vegetarian (and some vegan) menus I have seen at an upscale restaurant in this city. Why isn't this place crawling with veggie-focused foodies looking for options on the east side of town?   SERVICE: I have to say, as a service-focused reviewer (yes, I just gave myself that pompous title), I have had some of the best service while eating at Panevino. I struggled with giving them five stars based on the service alone. And during the last visit, our server Choy, provided such personable, kind, attentive, and knowledgable service that I want to go back when she's working next time. We told Choy that we wanted to look at their banquet halls and she took us to the hall and showed us around. We got to meet some of the special events staff and I appreciated the professional and expert information and service they provided.    If you've been in this town for over a month, you have experienced what passes for service in this town.  I love what Panevino is doing and that they seem to care about the customers who frequent the place. That quality sets them apart from so many places in Vegas. There is no gimmick here. Just good food and great service with a gorgeous view.",

He raved about the cioppino after that meal and promised to take me back for my own taste.  We finally returned this week, but unfortunately it wasn't as great as he remembered. After the third spoonful, it was clearly too salty.   The service was very good, but I did not get the warm fuzzies from our overly long wait at the reception at the hostess desk nor from our actual waiter himself. He needed to smile more. In fact, the entire staff would do well to smile more.  They do have a large plant-based section to their menu and I would like to return to try some of those.  The restaurant decor is beautiful, no surprise considering the owners' background.",

There are a lot of choices to choose from for salad, soup and sandwich, so good luck with the combo when you need to pick one of each. :)  I've found that the French dip sandwich is exceptionally good. The au jus isn't very salty and a dip of the sandwich in the au jus gives the roast beef + bread just the right amount of flavor. I round up my meal with chicken noodle soup and a Caesar salad.   Plenty of seating inside and parking outside.",

    "text": "This time when I arrived with Diane, one of my college fraternity brothers from long ago, and his wife, it was loud and noisy.  But we got the booth we had requested, and began with salty and warm Artisan Bread  that billowed like pliable Pita Bread, and was heavenly to eat either with EVOO or butter.  This cost $6.00 but was well worth it.  The complimentary regular Bread Basket also contained three types of tasty bread.  Fried crispy Mozzarella Cheese was great with a mild Marinara Sauce, and the golden Calamari & Shrimp Fritti was very good.  But my request for an aioli to go with the calamari was declined because the chef reportedly did not have some needed ingredients available, and the place was too crowded with diners.  Minestrone Soup was chock full of assorted vegetables.  My Caesar Salad was big and very good, and one of my party enjoyed an impressive looking Grilled Vegetable Salad that included red and yellow peppers, Romaine Lettuce leaves, asparagus, artichoke, and eggplant.  Service was good but not as attentive as before.  I had to ask for an Iced Tea refill once, and a straw twice.  And, a server was slow in bringing an ordered glass of wine and a cocktail.  The dark wood tables no longer had a linen tablecloth placed over them, so I thought the place looked less refined than previously.  But a nice touch was that lemon slices were served with plastic picks stuck in them.    The Veal du jour was Veal Piccata, which was veal scaloppini in a very lemony Lemon Butter, Caper, and Parsley Sauce served with tasty Sauteed Spinach and fine, diced Roasted Potatoes.  The spinach was not creamy, as I now prefer.  The other diners at my table reported that they very much liked their Veal Marsala and Short Ribs with Mashed Potatoes and gravy, but I was told that the Four Cheese Shrimp Ravioli dish was cold.   A Dessert Trio of Strawberry Napoleon, Creme Brulee, and Tiramisu was a great finish to a fine meal, but Diane and I were disappointed that a Dessert Duo is no longer offered.  We were told that this is because the restaurant no longer serves Chocolate Mousse.  When Diane expressed surprise that there was no artistry on the dessert plate as in all of our previous visits, and laughingly asked our server to take it back because of that, he reached out to grab and return the dish to the pastry chef to provide some decorative touches.  I said that would be unnecessary, and we launched into our wonderful desserts.  Then about 10 minutes later our server reappeared with a ceramic platter with nothing on it--just a special plate decorated with colorful fruit gel in the shape of leaves and blooming fruit.  It had a message written on it in Chocolate Gel that read \"Thank you For Dining With us\" (see pic).  This to me was a very nice, above and beyond gesture, and it helped to narrowly preserve a five-star rating for Panevino, which is still my favorite Italian restaurant for alta cucina in or outside Las Vegas.",

Thirteen salads range from $6.50 (half the selections are in this price bracket) to $8.95 (seafood). Twenty-one sandwiches range from $5.95 (cheeseburger) to $8.50 (#15 combo- half sandwich, cup of soup, and a side salad). Also has hot food (fifteen selections) that range from $1.75 (fries) to $9.95 (meatballs). Soups are $4.50. The full size desserts (cannoli, tiramisu, creme brulee, cheesecake) are $5.00 but the mini size desserts are $2.25. Also has cookies, gelato, and sorbetti.   I like the spinach salad for $6.95- baby spinach, bacon bits, egg slices, roasted almonds, and raspberry vinaigrette- mmm, it's really good; I've had it the most, at least three times. I don't remember if I had the chicken or turkey sandwich (had it once) but what I had was good. I remember the dessert being really sinful (also one time)- yup, a few hundred calories at least.   I'm curious to try this place in person. The concierge said that the restaurant part  is really nice. There are two parts- restaurant and deIi. I see a visit in the near future. Stay tuned.",

If you want outstanding food with homemade pasta and experience an owner Vincenzo who cares about his guests and food get in you car, plane, taxi or whatever and get there as fast as you can. I have eaten Italian food in many places, New York, Boston and overseas and this in my opinion is 6 stars.",

Our servers were really nice and accommodating, but somehow we ended up with too much food!  The seafood sampler appetizer was great and was larger than we expected.  We were pretty full after the appetizers were served already so we ended up cancelling a few entree orders so we can share.  They were very nice and didn't make this difficult in any way.  That's the mark of great service!  My friend and I shared the sea bass and I thought it was great, but then again sea bass usually speaks for itself!  I would eat here again and would recommend it to friends!",

I chose the chicken Milanese for my half sandwich, minestrone soup and potato salad. I took a very long time for our food to be ready. They call out your number and you go to the counter to pick it up. I thought they had somehow skipped our order or we just hadn't heard it being called. Finally after 15 minutes we received our order. My sandwich was very good. The only complaint would be that the outside of the bread was too crisp. The inside however was nice and soft. My minestrone soup was just ok. The vegetables were sparse and were cut up extremely small but the flavor was good. The potato salad came on a Omar and was a huge portion. It was very good. Nice and cold and good flavor. All in all I had a good experience but would not recommend going on your lunch hour when you are pressed for time.",

    "text": "So i took the advice of other fellow Yelpsters and hit this place up for a last minute work lunch with a co worker. Walking in the place is nice, clean, and a good location to meet a professional for a casual lunch or just to grab a quick bite. Prices must have gone up since some of these other reviews as i didnt see any of the $5.95 specials which is what i was looking forward to honestly.  Check the online menu and consider those the be the accurate prices, because they are. There are a few chalk board specials but they are all in similar price range as well maybe just combinations and or seasonal items as the specials.  I wasnt paying so i got the cheapest thing on the menu a $6.95 Mediterranean salad and it was less than exciting. I think the lack of vinaigrette made for a bland salad. Fresh yes... something to help the mushy olives taste and texture not so much. Everything looked very good from others plates and it might have just been what i ordered. Im sure that with another chance and me ordering say a sandwich it might turn out a little better although im not too big on paying $10 for a sandwich. I think if the place is a nice setup for a lunch especially if your trying to eat light and fresh. But if your watching dollars like many are these days you can find a lunch for half this price pretty easily.",

    "text": "First let me say that it was a tough decision between 4 or 5 stars. This place has excellent views of the strip and a very cool atmosphere mixed in with 'high class' dining and servers.   My wife and I have been to Panevino 3 times now. We've enjoyed it each time for various reasons. However, this last time put them over the top and they deserve a review. Last month was our anniversary. I called ahead during a weekday (just to make sure) and told them I was celebrating my anniversary w/ my wife. Neither of us are fish fans and she's a vegetarian so restaurants that can make minor changes to accomodate her diet move to the top of our list. We both had freshly made pasta dishes and they were excellent.   ...back to the story... At the end of our meal when we asked to see the desert menu, they brought out  a DELICIOUS desert (chocolate mussy kinda thing). It had \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate syrup across  the plate and 2 forks for us to share. Yes, it was free. As any guy can attest, things like this really make it for the women in our lives and truly made her night. As we were walking out, everyone was wishing us a Happy Anniversary. I would highly recommend Panevino to anyone!",

    "text": "Panevino is by far the nicest and best Italian Restaurant I have ever eaten at. Their service was amazing, waiters would refill drinks, remove plates, etc without interrupting me and my girlfriend, they allowed us to finish appetizers before they brought the main course, and made coming to this restaurant an amazing experience.  I work for a very large casino in Las Vegas, so I eat at 5star restaurants all the time, and I can honestly say this place blows them all out of the water. The ambiance is amazing, and the view is the absolute best I have ever seen in Vegas. This includes better than the rooftop views of Stratosphere, Voodoo Lounge, and some of the other clubs around the city.  The Gnocchi at this restaurant is AMAZING!  The rest of the food was amazing as well. We actually got Guacamole and chips as an appetizer (why an Italian place has Guacamole and chips I'm not sure though!) and it was the best I have ever had. The Guacamole was fresh, our waiter told us they made it per order fresh, and it tasted like it! The chips were amazing, and I would guess they made those there at the restaurant as well. Me and my girlfriend couldn't get enough!  Their drinks were great, we both got the pomegranate cocktail (forgot the actual name) and it was really good.  After dinner we went to their lounge, which is really nice, and they actually stayed open late while we finished our drinks before heading out for the night.  All in all, I would honestly say this has to be the best dining experience I have ever had, and we will be back. This place is for the \"romantic couple\" though, not the casual lunch I would say. And don't go here expected a bill of less than $100, we spent $125, and it was worth EVERY dollar. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I used to be a regular patron of the Deli -- getting the same, fantastic cobb salad 2-3 times per week. Yes, the salad was a little pricey, but the lemon vinagrette dressing was absolutely worth it -- and I would tell anyone that would listen to go to Panevino However, in the past few months, I've seen a major change that does not sit well with me as a regular customer:   1) I always get extra dressing (which I pay extra for, understandably). For the to go order, it used to come in large plastic cups, but they reduced the size of the plastic cups by half. Now, to get the same amount of dressing I used to get, I'm paying double for the extra dressing.   2) The base cost of the salad increased. So, along with my extra dressing that I now have to pay double for, I'm paying a full $2 more for the same salad, which was originally priced on the high side. I now pay around $12 vs. $10. The lemon vingrette is good, but it's not worth $12.  3) The salad used to come in a large plastic container. They have switched to a styrofoam container which seems smaller than the original plastic. Even if it's the same size, I hate using styrofoam simply for the environmental impact (and I'm far from an eco freak).  4) The quality has declined. I used to never have a problem getting the same great salad, but now, frequently, the tomatoes are mealy, the bread that comes with the salad is stale and the dressing is severly watered down.  I'm very disappointed with the decline of the Deli and I now only go when I absolutely have no other choice (I work in the area), which tends to be once every few months. I hope Panevino takes note, reverses the recent changes, then I will gladly return as a regular customer.",

    "text": "I went to Panevino last night with a friend, and I absolutely adored it.    The decor and architecture of this place are lovely and interesting.  It's a very open layout, but my friend and I sat at a table on the window, and it was very intimate because of the way the tables are setup.    We both ordered the tasting menu which is a GREAT deal.  $55 for an appetizer, salad or soup, entree, and dessert.  Considering that an entree alone runs you anywhere from $25 -$45, the tasting menu is a steal.  You do pay a few extra bucks if you want steak or osso buco, but I think it's still worth it.    I started with the prosciutto e melone appetizer, which was actually the only semi-disappointment of the night.  It was two lengthwise slices of honeydew each with a strip of prosciutto on top.  It was simple, and could have been better presented.  Obviously it tasted great, though.  My friend got the carpaccio, and that was excellent.  I had the pear and gorgonzola salad, which was very nice and light.  My friend got the mozarella e prosciutto salad, which was simple, but looked great.  For the main course, I had the lamb porterhouse, and it was excellent.  It was served with grilled asparagus and a potato cake (which was not great).  The lamb itself was perfectly charred in olive oil and rosemary.  There was no sauce, but it didn't even need sauce.  An excellent dish, cooked perfectly.  My friend got the ribeye with the porcini mushroom sauce (from the filet mignon), and he said it was fantastic.  For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee.  It was very rich, and in fact, a bit creamier than usual (which is saying something, for creme brulee).   He got the tiramisu.  Both were full size desserts, and after everything else, it was almost impossible to eat dessert.  (We managed, though).  We started with glasses of prosecco, and moved on to a bottle of Dolcetto d'Alba ($48), and then limoncello with dessert.  All were excellent, and while the drinks here tend to be on the pricey side (especially for Vegas), the wine list was a good balance of budgets, and the limoncello was homemade.  Yum!  It was a wonderful experience, and we lingered all over dinner for almost 3 hours.  The service was great.  Our server was there just enough but not too much, and the sommelier was at our table twice to ask if we needed help choosing a wine.  Overall, the servers, bussers, and somms all worked really well as a team, and we were well taken care of.  I have heard the martini happy hour is fun, so I'll definitely go back for that sometime.  If you're looking for a fabulous meal, I highly recommend Panevino.",

Attentive staff looked after our preferences and a Super Tuscan paired well with the veal special.  The house salad is nicely imaginative and a nice digression from \"Caesar\".  Too often, high-end Las Vegas restaurants take advantage of guests with indifferent service and neglectful kitchen preparation.  I'm pleased to report that Panevino is a delightful exception and apparently cares greatly about its customers.  We're headed back soon for a group dinner at the chef's table.",

We went there one night with clients around 9:30pm, the kitchen closes at 10pm during the week. Our clients were running late do to a miscommunication with a cab driver, Panevino's chef told us no problem, sit back and relex. He kept the kitchen open until our guest arrived and had a change to review the menu and order.    We went there one more time before leaving LV with some of our vendors as a thank you - it was a weekday - we arrived at 8pm and left at 11:30pm. Remember, the restaurant closed at 10pm - but they never said a word to us about the time, nor did they hover around trying to get us to leave.    Panevino's is the best kept secret in LV!",

Have already come back once, and will be coming back again for sure. It's right by the airport and I think it attracts a lot of buisness people who have to stop here for flights or are just here for the evening, which is perfect for that, I will agree. My friend from Canada was the one that took me and we both had a great time, he'd been here before!",

It was my wife's Birthday and we decided to celebrate here......and boy am I glad we did.  The staff was very friendly, nice, and accommodating (had to push back our reservations 1 hour).  The view at night is spectacular.  Being that it's just a few minutes south of the strip, you don't get that hustle and bustle feel to it, but you're still close enough to see the Vegas lights.  Very nice.    We started with the Fritto Misto.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  The texture was very light and crispy and not oily at all.  I also liked the shrimp was came along with it too.  The Tomato sauce was very flavorful and not too spicy....just right.    For our entrees, my son tried the Pollo Alla Brace and loved it.  He's NOT  a foodie and for him to make mention of any meal, it has to be good.  My wife tried the 4 Cheese Ravioli with Italian Sausage and the Vodka sauce.   She really enjoyed her meal as well, and her only gripe was that the portion was a bit on the small side..lol.  For my entree, I had to get the Cioppino.  This is my go to entree whenever it is on the menu and Panevino did not disappoint.  It was sooooo good, perhaps one of the best I've had.  Lot's of seafood and all perfectly cooked.  Half a Lobster, clams, scallops, and tons of fish.  The broth was slightly thicker than I've seen before but was piping hot and loaded with flavor.  The grilled Garlic crouton was perfect for soaking up the soup base.  I couldn't finish the entire thing, but thoroughly enjoyed it.  We'll be back to Vegas in February, hope we have time to swing by again!",

    "text": "This is one of two of my favorite LV restaurants. It particularly is a bright spot because the food is outstanding, the convention crowd does not come here and it has a fabulous view of the major runway at McCarin Airport.   A recent visit started with a Margherita pizza for an app. It was outstanding with just the right touch of ingredients and flavor that mad e it just right. The main course was a homemade Capellini al Pomodoro, Angel Hair pasta with Pear Tomatoes, Basil, Garlic and Extra-Virgin Olive Oil. My mother could not make this better. It is the simplest of pasta, but Panevino made it in such a way that the flavors just came bursting through.   This has been my experience almost every time I come here, and I have been here about a half-dozen times. The flavors are just delightful.   The service was very good. It was very light when we were there, but the traffic picked up by the time we left that the place was almost full. I get the impression that the place is a local hangout. People seem to know each other. That's good, because, again, the big reason I like this place is the lack of convention and tourist traffic.   I see many fellow Yelpers have had trouble with the service. I can say I have never experienced that. It has always been spot on and I have been here when it's been quiet and when absolutely packed.   As has been my custom in Vegas recently, I asked if the bar had a blender. It did! And, thought, Brandy Alexanders were not on the bar list, they whipped one up for me. A little too thin, but tasty. That makes Panevino a great place in my book!   Are you listening Steve Wynn and George Maloof??   Try this place. You will love it!",

The first time was based on a customer who works for Marnell Corrao, who told me a story about how Mr Corrao could not find any good Italian in Las Vegas.  So he built his own, and flew in chefs and staff from Italy.    After the first time, I was sold.  This place is amazing.    The wines, the service, the staff, and above all the food.    We're always treated like VIP's every time we go there, and we're not in any way a VIP.  They are just so welcoming, and on occasion a free glass of something special that the wine master they have just wants to let you try.    The Osso Bucco was fabulous, their lamb ragu, to die for.  Some of the other things we've tried is their cioppino (which is actually called something else since cioppino is spanish ;-) )  Either way, great food!",

We were met by a delightful Maitre d' who looked after us all night, while we were dinning.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing nice plush booths and a view of the Las Vegas Strip. The service staff was outstanding and was willing to help at anytime.  We both started off with cocktails my husband ordered a Martini garnished with olives stuffed with blue cheese.  I order an old cocktail and I was delighted to hear the bartender could make me a \"Tom Collins\" served in tall glass. I was told Panevino Restaurant make their own sour mix. The best \"Tom Collins\" I have had in years!  We ordered the bread that is served raised with Balsamic Vinegar. It is definitely an experience to taste this delicious thin bread ballooned up and dipping it in Balsamic Vinegar.  My husband ordered the Penne Alla Vodka Con Crema DI Pomodoro Fresco (Penne with creamy vodka-Tomato sauce and Parmigiano cheese) he was delighted with his selection.  I ordered the Pollo Alla Brace (Grilled chicken breast-marinated in Extra- Virgin olive oil, mustard, garlic, crushed red pepper and rosemary on a bed of roasted Potatoes drizzled with Lemon Sauce). The chicken was delicious and prepared perfectly.  Compliments of Panevino Restaurant served us an Anniversary dessert.  The dessert plate was beautifully hand decorated, so much care and attention was taken to make the presentation of our anniversary dessert plate special, made the evening very memorable! We will be returning to Panevino Restaurant.",

I came here for dinner last night and was greeted by a cute, friendly host who told me my table would be ready momentarily. After a few seconds, an awfully chipper man came to seat me and my date to our table. The view was exceptional although I believe every table has an amazing view of the Las Vegas strip.   Our server Shannon is by far the best server I've ever had at a restaurant. She was attentive but not over bearing. The food was an 11 on a ten point scale. I have to complaints on the food. For the price, you certainly get what you pay for. Large, filling portions are what they serve here at Panevino.   I couldnt ask or change anything else for my restaurant experience. I will definitely be coming back to eat here",

We had reservations at 7:30 and showed up earlier than planned but the staff was more than happy to accommodate us at a table. I was surprised it wasn't busy during the typical dinner rush instead people trickled in around 8:30 pm on a weekday.   As i do with all my reviews, I try to sample a little bit of everything on the menu so I can to give a fair review. Honestly their bruschettone is phenomenal. So much flavor on a piece of toasted ciabatta bread that includes mozzarella, eggplant, tomatoes and basil. Of course complimentary bread with olive oil and vinegar is always a good thing.   We ordered a couple dishes: Chicken & Asparagus Risotto and Spinach Ravioli. Both dishes were flavorful but my risotto was pretty dang good. As full as I was getting I kept trudging along in hopes of finishing it, alas I failed! By the time we were done with dinner there was no room for dessert!   The meal went perfectly with a glass wine but as others mentioned, not much of a selection when buying by the glass vs the bottle or half bottle. They did try pitching the half bottle but we settled for wine by the glass.   Overall it's a great place to experience off the Strip - same quality, same price but less chaotic. The service is wonderful and the ambiance is relaxing as you watch planes coming in for a landing or taking off. I highly recommend this place if looking for a romantic setting that's not crowded and not as loud as other restaurants. Plus they ask if you want a black napkin so you don't get the white lint on your clothes!",

Spacious floor plan where your table isn't on top of the family next to you. It was dimly lit, inviting and cozy.   Because we were such a large group, we were tucked into a long oval table that just about had its own zip code! We had one dedicated server--probably could have used two given the size of our party.  Our dining experience lasted close to four hours, which was just too long.  We did have an outside wedding cake brought in and the restaurant was gracious enough. to serve it.  That probably added an hour.   I ordered Rigatoni (I think--this was a few days and 2,000 miles ago).  It came piping hot and was delish.  Everything was very good--fresh bread, good appetizers and good size entrees that seemed to please all.  I heard no complaints.  Only compliments.    I live 2,000 miles away, so it's doubtful I'll make it back! But if I lived in the area, I would certainly return!",

    "text": "Panevino has been locked into my bookmarks for awhile. It's also been one of those, \"Should we go here?\" \"Nah, too far.\" conversations I've had with numerous people.  Everything fell into place when I selected Panevino for an early client luncheon with myself and my manager. The only downside of an early lunch meeting with a client means no wine to pair with my dish, but even without the wine, Panevino delivered. We were quickly seated in a booth that faced their large windows overlooking the Strip.   Definitely would like to come back here to be seated here at night, with my hubs, for a romantic dinner. Service was quick and efficient. Our server let us know about their specials for the day, and then brought out drinks and complimentary bread.  I ordered the Seafood Linguini because yes, I am going to order the seafood when I am dining on the company dime. I can say this, I ate every piece of that dish and I enjoyed every single minute I ate it. This dish was spectacular and it came with: shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine, and a hint of spicy tomato sauce. Panevino comes packing an extra punch with fresh-made pasta. Yes. If you have not eaten fresh-made pasta you're missing something in your life.  Unfortunately I did not get to order an appetizer or a dessert since lunch meetings tend to run on a bit of an \"hour and we're done\" kind of mantra. Suffice to say - I will be back for apps, wines, desserts, and I'll probably just be ordering that Seafood Linguini again.",

The only set back was that the meeting room was kind of dark, even when they had the lights turned up high and we could still hear the patrons that were having dinner on the other side of the door. But overall, this place is a great place and will definitely visit here again.",

I have heard many good things about Panevino, so last Friday, I decided to break away from my home brought lunch to join a couple of co-workers to eat here.  I figured the combo is a great way to try out Panevino.  The combo includes half a sandwich, side salad, and a cup of soup for close to $10.  I decided on the meaty (prosciutto, salami, capicola), cup of chicken noodle, and a side of Caesar salad.  I was very full after eating this combo.  Nothing special, taste like any other sandwich, soup, salad...  I had a piece of my co-worker eggplant parmigiana and it was oily but tasted pretty good.  Next time, I will probably try the actual restaurant side instead of the deli.",

We were asked if we wanted the happy hour menu, and we said yes, and expressed we were hungry. Another 10 minutes later we get the menu. Then 10 minutes after that, she asked if we wanted another glass of wine, we said yes and proceeded to attempt to order food but she walked away. You guessed it about another 10 minutes later we got out wine and she walked away abruptly as if she didn't want to take our food order. We decided to just to leave and asked for our bill. We waited again for her to bring it, and guess what. Nothing was comped for gambling. We decided we didn't have time to bring it up, paid and just left.",

A nice place to unwind and have a drink at the bar. The food is good. The menu is constantly updated. Each time I have been here I have had something new. I have been here many times and the food/atmosphere has always been great.  However, during my this last visit on January 6th, things have changed. The atmosphere was there. The food was good. The service- the waitress... not so good. In fact, her hospitality and behavior was quite terrible and I was definitely not pleased. I was entertaining co-workers from out of town and was embarrassed that I had suggested Panevino. Issues; slow service, did ask if we wanted to order drinks, tried to talk us out of ordering an appetizer, did not offer parmesan cheese for ravioli dish that obviously needed it, tomato soup was warm at best, offered cracked pepper and there were no salads on the table. Order 2 Peronis and she delivered 1 (had 2 on the tray). Just completely clueless. I do have to say that the manager did show great concern for the issue when I brought it to his attention. He offered to provide desert or wine to correct the issue, but I was up front and let him know that I was concerned for the service and was not looking for freebies. He did end up removing some items from the final bill. In closing, I will eat here again because I believe that everyone should get a second chance. I just hope that I do not have a similar experience, because there will not be a third time.",

    "text": "Since one of my trusty yelp friends has gushed over panevino how amazing the food was.  We decided to come here &  It was simply disappointing coming here.  I was so sad that I'm giving it a 3-star but it wasn't as great as the reviews & friends says it was.  My ratings:  SERVICE: (4.8 out of 5 stars) I must admit, I wanted to give an extra star for the service they provided but man the taste of the food had to take it away.  When we were seated the took out the extra silverware, but they ended taking a little too much because we ended up with only one butter knife & one napkin.  We asked for an extra butter knife & napkin but they completely forgot about it and remembered when we asked a second time.  I didnt mind that they forgot about since we were sharing the napkin & butter knife.   FOOD: (overall: 3.0 out of 5 stars) As the sound of one loses would hear, \"wahhh wahhh wahh\"  Appetizer:  Shrimp & Squid Calamari (2.8) The cost of the calamari & the size of it was not worth paying.  The taste and the flavors of it was not as strong as I would like.  The aroma was magnificent but taste was pretty bland. Carpaccio (2.7) Brio has better carpaccio.  I tried putting the beef carpaccio on the complimentary bread we had & added some parmesan cheese to enjoy this appetizer more. The salad that it had was very tasteful, I actually really liked it alot.  Entree (3.0) Mine: Blackened shrimp with Alfredo fettucini sauce.   The shrimp tasted amazing, it had the right amount of flavoring.  The alfredo not so much. The pasta was thin & it reminded me of one of those dinner plates that you microwave (lean cuisine,etc).  The pasta & alfredo sauce almost tasted exactly as the microwave dinner plates, how sad is that? sighs  Ambience/atmosphere: (4.5) Very intimate and relaxing.  The view is almost spectacular since you can see the Last vegas strip from your window seating and the airplanes coming & going.   We didnt even bothering ordering any desserts just because we were  that disappointed with our food.  I guess we wont be dinning here anymore.",

Panevino Service:  All my visits have been during the extremely busy business lunch rush or the Friday evening dinner rush and the service has consistently been on point.  Servers are all moving with sense of urgency and the kitchen gets the food out quickly.  Panevino Italian Cuisine:  Fettucine Alfredo is an Italian dish that can go wrong quickly if cheap ingredients and preparation is off in any aspect.  Panevino's has always come through for me.  The Alfredo sauce is on point with the creaminess texture and very flavorful.  The Fried Mozzarella has always been fried perfectly where it's still cheesy af (like me) in the middle.  The spinach salad is also a consistent performer as the ingredients are fresh, proportioned perfectly and the caramelized walnuts add a little something extra. High quality ingredients are utilized and you can taste it in all the dishes.  Panevino Ambiance:  Tall ceilings with huge glass windows by the airport runway make for a very nice open main dining area.  There's a high end classy vibe and the lights are dimmed considerably in the evening to make for a great intimate dinner environment.  The portions on the food are slightly less than I'd expect for the price point but it definitely makes up in heavy taste.  Quote from a friend \"These dishes are small and there's no unlimited bread sticks like Olive Garden?\" smh..we aren't at Olive Garden mf. =)  This a solid stand alone $$$ Italian joint off the strip that I'd like to visit more frequently and not in a business capacity.  That will will happen sooner versus later, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)",

I'm sure there are others with varying opinions, but for the quality of food, ambiance, and cost of the drinks, it's somewhat of a hidden gem on Russell road by the McCarran airport.  The beef shanks with a side of risotto were heaven with each bite bringing you closer to food \"O\".  Our maitre'd had me at, \"bone marrow\".   And what was surprising was that the drinks were very reasonably priced.  Entrees you can expect to pay $$-$$$, but it's worth the squeeze.  My Gin (Hendricks) and tonic with a cucumber (not lime) was only $6.  Most joints would charge $10-15 for the same beverage.  Try this hidden oasis for yourself and let the community know.",

    "text": "I never expected to see the classic scene from Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" - the one where an increasing number of sinister, threatening birds start gathering outside a schoolyard making aggressive sounds, intimidating moves, and penetrating glances  - but the equivalent happened in this large, upscale restaurant. \"Birds in a restaurant?\" I hear you say? No...worse. Much worse.  Just like the movie it started with ones and twos. I noticed the first one at a neighboring table, then two more came through the door. Temporarily distracted by drinks orders and our menu, when I next looked there must have been 12 of them. It was frightening and I started to feel uncomfortable in that wide-eyed, frantic way. We had been positioned in the far corner of the restaurant with a spectacular view of the cargo area of the adjacent airport, so the door was a long way away. I was already feeling anxious as I tried to plot a potential escape should things turn nasty. We faced an existential crisis and it wasn't clear we would emerge unscathed. At the height of the crisis, I estimated about 100 of them.  The restaurant was slowly filling with elderly and infirm customers. It was a geriatric attack.  From what was a pleasant, casual environment infused by light, rhythmic music, we began to transition to the moans, groans, random bodily expulsions and seepages of this octogenarian gaggle of bones, wrinkles, botox and veins. It was frightening. From the gentle wheezing of oxygen machines to the slow \"thud\" of colostomy bags colliding with chair legs, they began to overrun the place. We were in for a tough night.  The really scary part started when one of the waiters tripped on some dentures that had attached themselves to the coarse pile of the carpet, and fell forwards, crushing his skull against a walking frame. He was clearly shaken. The worse part was the accumulating drool in his hair and across his neck as a group of foot-shuffling patrons circled around. He managed to escape, but we never saw him again.  Things did settle down a little after that and we were able to survey the threat from a short distance, trying not to move so as not to attract any attention. My gaze was drawn to the next table, but my eyes struggled to focus and I was torn between watching an elderly lady remove her teeth and begin sucking a piece of bread, and the spreading damp patch on the trousers of her partner.   We struggled on with our food - which was excellent by the way - and pondered what had caused this overwhelming influx. Maybe a proliferation of 10 percent discount vouchers at a local motel? Were they delivered by bus, organized by frustrated family members acting in concert? And why this restaurant? Was its proximity to the airport chosen because of rapid access to a medivac helicopter? Was it the 24 hour Urgent Care facility just around the corner? We might never know. Having made our escape without detection we scanned the local news channels for information. There was nothing. Not a single report or explanation. It seems like we mixed our movie metaphors - it wasn't \"The Birds\" we were watching, but \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" Just what will the morning bring?",

It was a healthy choice but it was so delicious you wouldn't know otherwise. The general manager Vincenzo came to our table and talked to us, and made us feels so welcomed. He's plantbased and created many of the dishes on the menu.  My lunch companion is not vegan and she enjoyed her short rib with pasta.  I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

Arrived at 9PM... 30 minutes or so late for our Reservation and kitchen closes at 10 PM so they had to check if they would still seat us. I found that a little bit odd. 1 hour should suffice. That's the reason I'm giving 4 stars.   The food was absolutely fantastic at least mine and they will customize anything for you. I had the ahi tuna which was some of the BEST I've ever had.  It was plentiful and juicy and covered in sesame seeds. I substituted steam vegetables versus potatoes. Everything was cooked to perfection.  Chef brought our food and it was prepared quickly.  Cocktails were also good we had I Berry side car in a martini glass which was lovely. Also some sort of African cocktail kind of Mojito-ish muddled with mint which was even tastier.  Food fantastic A+ view A+ server nice however my pet peeve is when my plates are removed very quickly from the table when I'm still sort of peckish.",

My colleague tried the Sizzling Summer Special which included a sandwich, side, dessert and a small fountain drink (refills are free). My next visit I might try that just to have a cookie or a piece of cake ;). The food was good and salad was fresh. Caesar dressing is always great tasting here. Will definitely be back again.  One of the nice things is the Deli Cafe items can be packed to go and they accept call in orders if you want to pick it up.   Don't forget to have your stamp card stamped, 9 meals and the 10th is on them (up to $14 pre tax value).  Grazie for a nice lunch Panevino Deli Cafe!",

We started with tiramisu while we waited for our friend (who does that?). They have Guinness on draft! We had cannelloni (very good), the chicken special (good) and the Kobe burger (ok).  The burger patty was too small for the big, wide bun they serve it on. I found towel threads inside of the top bun. They were clean, white threads so I felt comfortable to just show and inform our server (who sent the manager who gave a sincere apology) and not wait for a new one. I think Kobe beef loses something when it's ground. Or maybe when dining in a nice Italian place, I should order pasta? The fries were delicious.  Choi was our server and she was excellent. Just attentive enough, thoroughly professional until we badgered her into giving us some sass. We enjoyed ourselves a lot.",

He made the reservation with no complications and we were seated right away upon arrival. The restaurant is huge, splitting into a separate deli/cafe area, then the main dining hall, then towards the back is the lounge/bar area with a nice romantic ambiance. We got to sit by a lovely view of the Strip which he was able to request while making our reservation.   There's a separate plant based menu that includes a variety of vegan dishes that all sounded so amazing! There's even two vegan desserts that the restaurant offers. I decided to go with the spinach ravioli with their house made ricotta and my fiance went with the short rib risotto. Both dishes were good but not as great as I had hoped; my dish only came with 5 big ravioli pieces considering the price & I was still kinda hungry after. I had to eat more of the complimentary bread afterwards so try to satisfy my hunger.   We also got the Panevino trio which includes a creme brulee, tiramisu, and a lemon tart which were all so delicious - highly recommend this dessert!   The service was great; server was very attentive & we always had our table cleaned right away as well as had our waters refilled ASAP.   Overall it was a nice first time experience, I just hope the other dishes I try next time are more satisfying than the dish I had. But other than that, I definitely recommend for a nice fancy date night; don't forget to try to get a seat by the window view of the Strip skyline!",

What took me so long to finally get here- I don't like Italian food. Not at all. I did not go in for the food, I came here only for the atmosphere, and my review is based exactly on that.   I came here on a Saturday night, the parking lot was busy but noise level at the restaurant was low and the place had a general aura of calmness and relaxation. I headed for the bar and ordered a vodka gimlet, which was well executed without unnecessary sweetness.   Bar area has video poker machines and several TV screens tuned to varied sporting events. The bar staff was attentive, upbeat and on their A game. Patrons seemed very friendly and engaged in a conversation.   In short, my evening turned out just as I wanted- friendly bar, beautiful restaurant, great location and quiet evening. I would definitely recommend this to a couple looking for a romantic, elegant setting to enjoy a conversation and Italian food, if that's your thing.   I ended up ordering short rib risotto all the while wishing I stuck to a salad because again, Italian food is just not my thing. I still don't get it, even after visiting countless Italian fine dining establishments.   I ended up thoroughly enjoying my evening and the experience and see myself returning for more cocktails and maybe a salad :)",

It is right down the street from my house, and actually I cannot wait to eat here again.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and romantic, and the service was exceptional.   The waiter's name was Eric, and he was very attentive and helpful.   We ordered the Warm Artisan Bread, the Pear and Gorgonzola Salad, the Angel Hair Pomodoro with Shrimp, the Short Rib Entree and the Lemon Tart for dessert.  Everything we ordered was just great!  About a week has passed since eating here and I can't help but keep thinking about what a great experience I had at this restaurant.   If you haven't tried it, make sure you do!",

They have plenty of options to choose from, including soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and desserts. Their food is prepared with great quality items and always tastes freshly prepared.   They have their own parking lot, so it is a quick place to get in and out of. They have fantastic food, good service, and I would consider it a very top notch business.",

    "text": "Loved my first experience at Panevino!  We had a reservation (in which we denoted it was a birthday and also that we are vegan) and got a beautiful view of the strip from our table and saw airplanes up close taking off, very different and wonderful.  They acknowledged our plant-based preference without us mentioning it other than in reservation notes.  Michael was our server.  Professional and friendly.  We received the Artisan Bread and the Hummus Rolls (highly recommend those for anyone).  The eggplant in the hummus rolls was tasty and creative.  Perfection.    We ordered the Fried Artichoke side as another appetizer.  Lightly dusted in flour and most likely lightly fried in a pan, as opposed to a fryer, which left them tasting delicate and delicious.     For entrees we split the Grilled Vegetable Lasagna and the Organic Spinach and 'Ricotta' Ravioli.  Both really good.  The ravioli took a far first in my book though.  The lasagna was full of vegetables and not heavy on the noodles, which to me is great!  The ravioli was incredible and completely oil-free!  Cashew tomato vodka sauce. Walnuts. Basil. Homemade pasta.  Love it.   Vincenzo, the general manager, was exceptional with his hospitality and conversation.  The staff was helpful and on top if their game.   Received a birthday dessert that was like a chocolate pudding almost with a little puffed brown rice and fruit. On a custom decorated dish full of flavorful reductions.   Amazing.  Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, Panevino was not a very memorable restaurant experience.  The ambiance is great, the waitstaff was fine, and the food was OK.  I felt as though Panevino serves regular Italian food, but made to look fancy.   Being Italian, I was on a kick for a while to always be unsatisfied when I ate Italian food at a restaurant.  It just did not compare to my Grandmother's cooking.  However, as I have recently eaten at some great Italian restaurants (Scarpetta, Angelini Tratoria, Fabbio's retaurant, etc), my opinion has changed.  These restaurants are able to serve Italian food that is NOT what Grandma makes.  They serve fancy and innovative dishes that are something special.  I ate with Mr. Riches at Panevino, and he felt the same.  Panevino didn't have anything that blew me away.  The meatballs for appetizer were good, but nothing special.  The Burratta was good, but I've had much better.  And my Risotto was pretty salty.  I'm glad that I gave it a try, but I don't think I will be putting it on the repeat list.",

Treated as guests of the house, a request to undertake a family-style tasting seeing the kitchen select plates that they felt to show the Chef's work best, it was to nearly a dozen of the restaurant's long-held signatures that the evening unfolded and starting off with fluffy pan caldo and balsamic dotted olive oil alongside two drinks it was admittedly an unexpected treat that I truly enjoyed the Rum and Chartreuse Avocolada, as boozy sort of smoothy with no lack of vegetal creaminess and just enough sweetness added by coconut sorbet and pineapple juice.  Next presented a basket of warm housemade bread, the foccacia quite remarkable while the baguette was dry and out of place, course two featured a quartet of scallops with a light sear contrasting the nearly raw center, the piquant red sauce playing a robust foil to the sweetness of the mollusks while creamy creme fraiche added a tangy finishing note.  Described as a signature of Chef Mario Andreoni, the second appetizer of the evening was presented as a trio of paired bites, and although the marinated artichokes were mild and by themselves quite pleasant the roll of pork proved quite unbalanced after the marinade, entirely overwhelming the cheese and eggplant to the point where the later was not detectable in a single briny bite.  Served throughout our meal by a waiter who'd recently been imported from elsewhere, but also looked over closely by General Manager Vincenzo Granata, whose years of training at Le Cirque have no doubt been put to good use, course four featured a duo of pastas and with each made in house the quality of San Marzanos and fresh Mozzarella were all that was required to accentuate the feather light potato dumplings while ribbons of  Tagliatelle were perfectly al dente beneath a robust and meaty short rib ragu.  Admittedly a bit pricey considering the off-strip location and a style of cuisine that can be found without the beautiful room and service for as much as 50% less within ten miles of the space, entrees consisted of Osso Bucco and Cioppino each priced at $49 and while the former was every bit as rich and tender as that at Ferraro's atop textbook saffron risotto the latter was mostly a one note experience, the seafood itself just fine while only the taste of tomatoes were detectable in the broth.  Moving onto desserts, the first round offered by Vincenzo while two more were selected to test the mettle of the pastry staff, suffice it to say that the \"souffle\" is nothing like one would expect from the description and although rich enough to be sure, still a textural disappointment as was the \"tart\" that presented more like a soggy millefoglie.  Treated to a double espresso on ice, my friend electing a simple cup of brew, round two of desserts stuck more closely to the classics and thankfully was executed with far more precision, the lemon cake light and aromatic alongside what is amongst the city's most restrained and balanced Tiramisu.",

I choose the Penne pasta in vodka sauce delicious, and Cesar salad crisp greens wonderful flavor.  Hubby had the roasted vegetable lasagna which he enjoyed.  Eating out can be a challenge for the two of us but Panevino offers choices we can both enjoy as well as a beautiful ambience.  We sat in the bar area, as we where dressed very casual, and which offers great value on happy hour half price wine and cocktails as well.  The only not so great thing about our visit was the female bartender, I am sure was not trying to be offensive but when she brought me out the set up, she let me the small fork was for my salad. LOL, not sure why she felt the need to tell this since I am not 8 years old.",

I had the Roman Holiday cocktail, Mario's Artichoke & Zucchini appetizer, the fresh artisan bread, Caesar Salad, Avocado Pesto & Mushroom Risotto, a sweet anniversary plate of chocolate gelato, and a special dessert wine \"that we will remember for the rest of our lives\" as a gift from GM Vincenzo. My husband had the house Chianti, pasta fagioli, Andrea salad, & ribeye with gnocchi and he devoured everything. Food and service (by our very knowledgeable and attentive server, Michael) were beyond excellent. Pricey but worth it. I can't wait to go back and try something else!",

Our reservation was at 5pm and we arrived maybe 10 minutes early, and the manager saw us outside and invited us in because it was raining. We sat at the bar and gambled and had a couple drinks. Why is it that a parties that arrived after us got sat before us???? Makes no sense.  Our server was nice, talked a little bit. Informed us of the specials which I wish I would've got the lobster ravioli.....I had the osso bucco which was just ok...I've had much better elsewhere. The meat was dry but the risotto was good. My bf had the ribeye, he said it was ok. The cream of corn was not good. Too much butter and not enough heavy cream. Way more salty and hardly sweet. Lots of fat off the ribeye steak. Yes we know it's a fatty cut of beef but this piece had tons of fat. Almost just as much there was meat. He said this sure didn't seem like a 22ounce steak. The best part of our meal was the calamari and shrimp appetizer. Sad because it's just breaded and deep fried... I didn't feel as if this experience was worth the $280 we spent for 2 people.  At least the view was pleasant with a window view. The airport was much more nice to watch with all the clouds and rain. Glad we got to experience to place but I don't believe we will. Nice staff though.",

My wife had Gorgonzola salad and I had the stuffed pepper appetizer. Both were excellent. Vincenzo brought us a desert selection that was very well presented and also tasted great.

We were coming from Vietnam, Atlanta, San Francisco and Chicago and after lots of research I picked Panevino. We wanted a classic Italian with stylish decor and we got it!   It was amazing in all ways! We had a mix of dietary issues - meat eaters and vegans and a diabetic - and the staff were brilliant as was the food.  The service was spectacular; soon after arriving the owner graciously came to our table and introduced himself, told us where he was from in Italy and explained the menu and told us that he himself had created -the 2 page I think - vegan menu !   Food was delicious ( and we're a fussy lot!) and the highlight of the night was the view of the skyline when the sun sets a lovely touch!   Great job team !  The only thing I'd change is add a piano/band playing not too loudly but it was so nice that we could chat and maybe that would be ruined it!",

    "text": "Amazing!  Not the food, Not the ambiance, Not the view.... What is amazing about Panevino is the greasy looking manager who came over to our table just as our food was delivered and then proceeded to talk to us for a half hour as our food got cold. The sound of this blowhards voice was more important to him than the enjoyment of the guest. We ordered off the vegan menu, can't tell you if it was good or not. I can tell you that by the time we got to eat it that it was cold. Stay away...this place is a joke",

    "text": "Been here so many times and always had great meals. I came here last night with 3 other people. We had wine, appetizers, salads and entree's. I ordered the blackened shrimp with fettuccine. The shrimp looked a little funky but tasted good so I just ate it.   I drove straight home after the meal and got very sick. Puking and everything else you can imagine. It was awful. I am not sure if our out of town guests got sick because they are at a hotel and probably wouldn't say anything.   I called the manager Vincenzo this evening to let him know what happened. He was very apologetic but basically said he couldn't imagine I had food poisoning. I was a little taken aback by this. Do you think I have nothing better to do with my life than lie about food poisoning? I was not in the mood to argue with him because I had been sick all night.   I thought it was outrageous that he didn't even offer to refund my meal. I would have refunded the entire check just out of principal. We still do not know if our guests got sick.   This is not a way to treat or take care of a customer. I used to frequent this restaurant but can never go back or recommend to anyone again. Such a shame.   Be very careful if you eat here. Make sure your food looks and smells ok. They will not believe you if you get sick.. maybe a visit from the health department would be good. Just don't want anyone else going through what I did yesterday.",

    "text": "Normally the Post Office I go to is behind the airport here in Las Vegas.  And when I go there, I always pass this place.  It's kind of tucked away in a strange place, not too far from Town Square. I've wanted to try it for a few years, but because of its location, I always forget about it.  Some friends of mine called and they were celebrating their mother's 93rd Birthday, so they said they wanted to go here.  I was elated.  It's hard to see the place from the road, but it is massive!  Not only do they have a huge restaurant, but they also have quite the lounge area and they have a deli as well.  I totally forgot to check out the deli, so I will definitely have to check it out next time.  I was a little early, so I decided to have a couple of cocktails.  The bartender was good and nice.  And he made my Tito's Gimlets just the way I like them.   I'll have to come back for Happy Hour some time.  I'm sure it's good there.   When my friends arrived, we sat in their beautiful dining room, with a great view of the planes taking off & The Strip in the distance.  The service was outstanding.  Our waiter told us the specials, but we pretty much knew what we wanted.  The Birthday Girl had Lasagna, which she loved and ate it all.  One of my other friends had Short Rib Risotto, which looked amazing and he enjoyed.  My other friend ordered Veal Marsala with Blue Cheese Mashed Potatoes (which looked amazing) & sauteed spinach, and she loved it.  I had the Cannelloni, which I enjoyed thoroughly, but I will take two issues with it.  Cannelloni means it has meat inside.  This did not, it only had Spinach & Ricotta Cheese.  That is Manicotti, which I prefer!  The other issue I will take with it is the tomato sauce was a little bland.  I like a little Italian Food with my Garlic.  It needed a little \"umph\"!  But the pasta was wonderful and I would order it again.  We had a nice bottle of Chianti, that my friend ordered, but I also forgot to check out the wine list.  I did notice they had several bottles along the wall, so I know it's extensive.  And the service was very fast.  I waited for a sandwich at Denny's longer last week, than I did for my food last night.  And after dinner, they brought the Birthday Girl a mini Strawberry Napoleon, on a plate that said \"Happy Birthday\" written on it in syrup.  The prices were a little on the higher side, for a restaurant not on The Strip, but they weren't terrible.  Overall, it was a great meal, in a lovely setting, with outstanding service.  Definitely recommended.",

Loved the view of the Las Vegas strip area from here and watching the airplanes take off from the airport.  Although I think they'd allow you to come here dressed casually, you'd probably fit in and feel more comfortable if you were dressed up a bit.  Also if you're planning on visiting here on a special holiday like Valentines Day you'll probably want to make reservations ahead of time. I would imagine this place would get really busy on those special days.  The food and staff were great. I'm sure we'll be visiting again.",

    "text": "We loved this place! We came here for date night on a friends recommendation. We made reservations because we wanted to make sure we got a booth facing the strip. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and we were seated quickly. The place is dimly lit and has a nice ambience. Our server came by to list off the specials and give us our menus. We decided to order the chefs special Chilean sea bass and Tagliatelle short ribs Mario's style, and a dessert sampler.  They brought over a bread basket, the bread was great and soft but I do wish it was served warm. I did appreciate that it was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead of the usual butter. The food took quite a long time to come out, long enough that my hungry husband requested another bread basket haha. When the food arrived at the table, we were excited to dig in!   Chilean sea bass- this was just amazing! It was perfectly cooked and the citrus glaze that it was served with was perfect. The golden Yukon potatoes that were served with it were a bit undercooked but had good flavor. Hubby does not eat fish but hubby ate a good chunk of it.   Tagliatelle short ribs Mario's style- hubby loved this! The pasta was al dente, something that very few restaurants here in Vegas are capable of so that was a definite plus. The braised short ribs had so much flavor and they were so tender!  The Panevino trio dessert platter- this came with creme brulee, tiramisu, and a strawberry lemon Napoleon cake. The creme brulee's shell was a bit too thick but the custard part was delicious. Tiramisu was good, not the best I've had but hubby enjoyed it. The strawberry lemon napoleon was probably our least favorite. Too much pastry and the filling was too sweet. We probably wouldn't order this again since there are more options on their dessert menu. We were just excited to try 3 things.   Service was great, our water glasses were always full, and they checked in with us quite often.  We will definitely be returning to try more things on the menu.",

They accommodated me with my choice of entree due to the changes I made. I had the shrimp and scallops risotto. It usually comes with a spicy tomato sauce. But I don't like spicy food so I requested the creamy Parmesan sauce which is on a different risotto dish and it was cooked perfect and delicious. It was creamy and had a good amount of shrimp and scallops in the dish. For dessert I had the strawberry Napoleon which had a lemon cream in the middle and it was delicious. It didn't have a whole lot of cream in the middle but it still was delicious. A friend of mine had the Panevino trio and it also looked delicious. Overall everyone in our party enjoyed their meals and desserts and we would go to dinner there again.",

The atmosphere, the drinks , the food , the local clientele, and most importantly the staff were all amazing. We had the pizza from the happy hour menu and it was perfect. We also had the scallop appetizer and beef short rib risotto dish. I consider myself a foodie with a somewhat sophisticated pallet, at least in my mind and all the dishes were top notch. Ben was our bartender , Vincenzo was the manager  and the Executive Chef Mario Andreoni came by to visit and our dog got spoiled by him. We are happy to revisit and once again become regulars at Panevino on our date nights.  Thanks , Kenny and Bri and Burger",

The restaurant is upscale elegant, especially for a non-Strip restaurant with an excellent view of the Strip in the distance. Erik, our server, was at our table shortly after we sat down. Very welcoming. Took our drink orders and answered questions about the menu choices. I went with the orecchiette and sausage ($29). It came with homemade sausage ragu, mascarpone cheese and a red sauce. Delish!!! My daughter ordered the Andrea salad ($11) which I got to taste. Romaine lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, cannelloni beans, radicchio with crumbled blue cheese. Also delish. For her entree she got the vegan spinach ravioli ($26). Vegan dishes, in general, are not my thing. This one didn't change my opinion. Overall, excellent ambiance with a killer view, excellent service, and excellent food. A little pricey for a local Italian restaurant but appropriate for the level of ambiance, service and food quality. Definitely a good place for a celebration dinner.",

My first impression: \"This place is fancy!\" The atmosphere is elegant and dark, with lovely music. Unique pendant lights. I love the vine/flower partition between the kitchen and seating area. The patterned carpet is fun. All the tables have tablecloths, definitely upscale!  We were seated by the window, which was perfect to view the sunset, city,  and airplanes.  Our server was Eric. He was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu and specials. He made sure to keep our meals separate, since I am vegan and my boyfriend is not. He was quite attentive but still gave us our space.  I ordered the Vegan Cesar salad and Vincenzo's Organic \"Ricotta\" & Spinach Ravioli. The plating for both the pasta and salad were beautiful! Great presentation! The salad didn't scream \"Cesar\" but was still delicious. The ravioli was savory and rich; so delicious I ate every bite!  My boyfriend loved this four cheese ravioli and Cesar salad. Also beautiful plating! He couldn't finish everything, so our server boxed up his leftovers and included extra bread.  We were pleasantly surprised with separate  Anniversary desserts! Mine was a chocolate \"ice cream\" and he got a pastry of some kind.   I would recommend Panevino to everyone! It is perfect for classy special occasions. I love that they offer a full plant-based menu. I will be back for our next special occasion (can't wait to try the other menu items)!",

The portions were decent, not huge like Olive Garden dishes but the quality is so much better and does not leave you feeling like a fat marshmallow for eating too much. The rest of their menu has your typical drinks, meats and desserts. The window views were nice and the ambiance was a little more formal. Overall, dope place to go if you're looking for a place that's not too crazy (like many restaurants on the strip).",

I'm disappointed I didnt get to try this place but if their security treats customers so badly I just couldn't go in.  I was too upset and I really was looking forward to it.",

My daughter asked for a Shirley temple and her eyes were so big when she saw the size of it and the number of cherries! They don't have a kids menu for dinner so portions were a plenty and we had leftovers, but I am happy to say everything was still delicious the next day. I had the house cab and short rib with mashed potatoes. I was extremely satisfied. My daughter had the Lasagna and she devoured every bit! They are known for their great view of the strip and I enjoyed it as a local as well. We also shared the Chocolate Lava cake and the Trio dessert with the kids and my friends. We will definitely be back!",

It seems lame to write about the entrance of a restaurant, but it was really pretty. Smelled like a billion flowers in a tiny garden :)  The atmosphere in the dining area was also really nice - almost romantic but classy enough to be appropriate for business dinners. Attire seemed business casual and we saw several business dinners (you can tell) being conducted there on a Wednesday night.  Food I tried:  *House bread - fresh and warm. Nothing to complain but nothing to crave either. *Green Salad - pretty simple and boring.  *Risotto with beef - i've had better but this was pretty good. Risotto was creamy and beef was really tender.   Service was excellent from start to finish. I would definitely like to dine her again and try other menu items.",

We sat down, server immediately took our drink order, which was nice and we started with a soup. Soup was good, wish I could remember the name, but it was one of the plant based options. However, everything after that was very underwhelming. I ordered a salmon dish, as I always do in every restaurant and a friend ordered some vegan ravioli. Presentation was okay ... Salmon had no taste, it almost tasted like a frozen meal to be honest. I definitely feel like i didn't get my money's worth for the dish I got, considering I've had far better overall service and quality of food somewhere else for wayyy cheaper. Wish I could say I would like to give it another chance, but I don't think I will be coming back.",

Thirty seconds later we heard the dinner specials. one minute after that, we were asked if we had questions about the menu. 30 seconds later we had our bar drinks. We ordered a bottle of Malbec Wine from Argentina that was to die for. The staff constantly returned to refill the wine, the water and soda. The appetizers, salads and the meals arrived in a very timely fashion. I took the advice from the review by Gary T. and had the Grigliata Di Pesce ( Lobster tail, Salmon, Shrimp, Scallops, Tuna and Chilian Sea Bass Sauteed Spinach, Potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce) and was grilled just enough to get the grilled taste. He was correct about the $40.00 price tag. It was worth every penny. My wife shared a lamb chop dinner with her mother and asked if one of the three lamb chops could be cooked different. The lamb chops arrived cooked perfectly and tasted great. Two were cooked well done and one cooked medium rare. These guys also made the evening special with a birthday dessert for my mother in law. If your in Vegas and want the best Italian food, save your money on the Vegas strip (casino) meal and spend the extra money for the cab ride to Panevino Restaurant. The cab ride from Planet Hollywood only cost us $40.00 (including the tip) round trip.",

A lot of the pasta was made onsite in the beginning but since the new head chef, some things are missing. The homemade Lemoncello is gone... and once you've had the good stuff nothing compares. I have been to Panevino at least 40 times since they have opened and frankly I still go back. Yes some things have gone mainstream, but you cannot get a better southern Italian meal in Las Vegas. Next time you are there ensure you ask what pasta is made in house and you will not be disappointed.",

Only a person who has never been out to eat in public could have enjoyed this food.  Everything, and I mean every single item brought to the table, was purchased pre-made, frozen, deep fried or baked, then put on a plate. It all tasted like it came from the supermarket. The crab cakes had no crab, just mush, we had to send back.  I am from Maryland, so I usually lower the bar when it comes to crab cakes when ordering them out, but this was the stuff you buy at safeway and fry up.  I rarely ever send soemthing back, but i had to.  The next freezer to fryer to plate dish was fired cheese.  The sauce was stragiht from a jar, the cheese greasy and tasteless.  If you ate a cheap buffet in pahrump and thehy had this included, this is what it would taste like.  I swear it loked the same the next day co ming out as it did going in the night before.  Next up, the fabulous contadina frozen ravioli with straight out of the jar sauce.  No flavor at all. eating it was a chore, but by now I was hungry as the prior pre cooked slop was uneatable, so I managed to get three down.  Final worrd, if anyone likes this bar food, you have never eaten at any restaruant with a real chef.  IF i read one more reveiw how \"mama loved it\", i will track you down, force you to go to Piero's or Bouchon and make you try real food.",

The service was slow, our waiter forgot cocktails and did not explain specials to us. He did not offer cracked pepper for our salads and I had to ask the busser for it. I would expect this caliber of service at IHOP or Fridays, not a fine dining restaurant. I had family in town and they were disappointed as well. In fact nobody at our table enjoyed dinner. We brought this up to the manager who did offer us free food which we declined because by now we were ready to leave. They did not take anything off of our bill. We had a plethora of food left over at the end that we were going to take home to the dogs but decided just to throw in the garbage.

    "text": "I'm in Vegas for work for about 3 weeks every year. The worksite is about a mile away and there are not a lot of food choices in the area. One of the 'locals' recommended PaneVino and for about 4 years now, this is my favorite lunch spot in Vegas.   The food is fresh and appealingly displayed, and the service is fast (a definite criteria for lunch). Plus it is not a chain restaurant. I prefer the deli (for speed of service) but I have eaten in the restaurant and the food is good also. This review is for the deli.   The menu consists of sandwiches, soups, salads, pizza, and hot 'cafeteria' items. You order at the counter, pay, take a seat, and they bring the food to you in very nice wooden trays. You can pretty much preview the hot items, which are mostly Italian dishes, and the salads in the 'cold' case. Between me and my coworkers, we've tried most of the items and I can't remember any complaints. My favorite is the seafood salad ($9). This is loaded with jumbo shrimp, calamari, octopus, and mussels, all tossed in a light vinaigrette. The serving is very generous, with some greens (I always ask for a tad more greens which they always happily accommodate) and a couple of slices of excellent Italian bread.   They make homemade gelato and sorbets and at $1.25 a scoop, you can't go wrong.   But the absolute BEST thing they sell are Pignoli - Italian pine nut cookies. I've brought them home and my sister-in-law, who is Italian, gives them the thumbs up. Definitely have these.",

    "text": "This review of Panevino Deli Cafe (PDC), just off Sunset across from the airport, is based on at least twenty visits over the past year. The deli, which opened about 10 years ago, promotes itself as an upscale gourmet Italian deli with upscale prices to match. It's geared more to locals and business persons than tourists though I have seen tour buses at the restaurant before. Whereas the attached Panevino Restaurant has a great view of the airport and the Strip, the deli generally looks to the south and southwest out over the parking lot and adjoining commercial/business district (though the view over the restaurant's courtyard is nice). Panevino also offers private banquet facilities. My Yelp review is only for the deli which is open from 11:00AM to 5:00PM, Monday through Friday except holidays.  The deli space is fairly large and clean and has the look of a modern deli with its large glass windows, wood paneling and Italian-esque decorations. The staff is friendly and efficient. The lunch menu offers full- or half-portion Italian salads, fairly large sandwiches and hot main dishes. The deli also offers a selection of various Italian side salads, 3 different soups and quite a selection of pastries, cookies, gelato and sorbetti. The eating area offers 20 or more tables indoors and 4 or so outdoors (mostly for smokers). You place your order and pay the tab at the cash register and wait for your number to be called. Some days they are crowded at lunchtime but the order usually comes out in 5 - 10 minutes. Sandwiches are served in baskets with either a bag of chips or a small portion of average tasting coleslaw or another salad (in a small plastic container -- probably 2-3 ounces or so) while main dishes are served on clean white plates; both on a large fancy plastic tray. You pick up your own utensils, napkin, condiments and fountain drink. They also offer several different Italian sodas, flavored waters and other beverages.  Mostly when I eat at PDC I order a sandwich, chips and a soft drink. The overall quality of the meals I've been served is somewhat variable. I usually like the meatball sub with its three large warm meatballs, melted provolone cheese, tangy tomato sauce and sprinkled on Parmesan cheese served on a fairly large and crusty Italian roll but sometimes it is prepared with a different bread, cool meatballs and a sauce that is just not quite right. I've also had the French Dip (OK, sometimes fatty), the Reuben (greasy), Big Turkey (eh), and Grilled Chicken Club (OK) sandwiches as well as a few of their hot meals including Meat Lasagna (not like mom's -- her's is sublime) and Chicken Parmigiana (OK I guess). A lunch sandwich with chips and a small soft drink usually sets me back about $12.  PDC is a place I love to hate. It's convenient to my work. It offers a clean and attractive eating area as well as a friendly staff. My biggest disappointment is with the \"meats\" they put into the sandwiches -- they're just not what I'd expect from a gourmet deli. They don't seem to make these \"from scratch\" in their kitchen. It does not have the gourmet mouth-feel or taste to match the upscale prices. Is it really easier to serve processed turkey roll than it is sliced roasted turkey? What about the meatballs, the corned beef and the others? To me the deli-\"meat\" is obviously the reformed \"roll\" stuff that many restaurants like to use these days. Perhaps it is a \"sign of the times\" that restaurants sometimes use these industrial substitutes to lower costs or offer more choices; but for me, it just makes the food seem cheap and overpriced.  By the way, they now offer a customer loyalty card -- buy 9 lunches and get the 10th free. Warning: only one stamp per party (rather than per person or meal ordered).  -- 4.0 deserved stars for the beautiful deli and 3.0 disappointing stars for the deli food",

    "text": "We arrived at 9:30 and they were scheduled to close at 10. I asked the hostess if it was still okay to be seated or if we should just go somewhere else. I hate coming in super late because I know everyone's trying to get out of there and most of the time everyone is rushing and not that attentive. The hostess assured me it was perfectly fine and not to worry. I should have trusted my instincts. I think the kitchen was ready to get out of there.   Service was great, but we were very disappointed with the food. I wasn't super hungry so my husband and I planned on splitting everything. We started with the caprese which was fine...it would be tough to mess that up since it's pretty much tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. Then we ordered the 3 cheese ravioli...the raviolis were cold even with the heated sauce on top and the raviolis themselves were really hard. We wanted to be easy going so we just asked our server for fried mozzarella instead which he happily did. 5 min later I look up and here comes out server. I'm thinking to myself \"wow they cooked that really fast. I wonder if someone else originally ordered that for their table and they gave us priority.\"  Come to find out we got it so quickly because it wasn't cooked!!  It was fried on the outside, but the cheese was ice cold, not even melted at all. That was it...we asked for the check and paid and left.   Overall, we had such high hopes for this place. It was very disappointing!!!",

Mark, the Assistant General Manager and Mixologist puts any drink I've ever had to shame- and I've had very good hand crafted drinks. He gives an unbelievable attention to making high quality/craftsmanship drinks!!! Each season he creates a unique drink menu with a theme. Not one drink has High Fructose Syrup, artifical anything... you WILL thank me!   It's a less rushed vibe than many spots on the strip with better/equal service at friendlier prices. And a phenomenal view of the strip.  For food, let me say that Carnivore's, Pescetarian's, Vegitarian's and Vegan's will delight!   I'm partial to the Plant based menu options (thank you Vincenzo!!!). and many of my meat eating friends have enjoyed these dishes as well!   I've been told they serve 'one of the best steaks I've ever had', the seafood platter is abundant and fresh, desserts are amazing! I've sent 20-30 people to eat at Panevino since discovering it several years back and I've only had people RAVE about it after dining- not one person has given a negative report!!  They also have a deli open during lunch which is worth a trip en route to the airport or casual lunch if you live in Vegas.   You owe yourself the treat of dining there :-)  Please thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit.

We noticed nothing had straight lines, but everything was eclectically curves and angles. It really added to the atmosphere and gave you a lot of things to appreciate while you were eating. Besides the view of the strip was nice and I can only imagine it was beautiful at night too.  When you check in to yelp, you get a free glass of wine. I chose the white, and it was a nice mild selection.  They put complimentary bread on the table that was fresh and tasty.    I ordered the seafood linguini and it was delicious. The linguini was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of pieces of seafood throughout the dish.   My friend and I decided to split a dessert, so we ordered the trio.  It has a delightful lemon and fruit tart with a nice flaky pastry, a cup of cream brulee which was creamy and delicious with the traditional crusty sugar top, and a nice piece of tiramisu. I don't care for coffee flavored desserts, but she ate it all, so that's a good sign.    Really fell in love with this place....from the decor, to the atmosphere, the wait staff, to the food...all superb. We will be back!",

    "text": "A consistent option ideally located for meeting in the South Strip area without dealing with Strip traffic, Panevino's restaurant is among the most unique in design and location.  Among our group last night was Major Martin, a pilot who referred to the design of the place, with its curving glass wall overlooking the airport runway at ground level from across the street, as \"the sexiest air traffic control tower I've ever seen\".  The view of the Strip across the runways is stunning. The proximity and ease of access at ground level makes Panevino a simple choice.  If you aren't in the mood for a full dinner, the bar is exceptional.  This venue has always served me well as a spot to meet for business at lunch as well as dinner or cocktails.    Our party of eight included the discriminating tastes of the Consul of Chile and the Consul of the Czech Republic, visiting with a former consul of Slovakia.  Though we had two more in our party than our reservation, the staff quickly and happily extended the table.  The chicken risotto was perfect, with great care apparent in the freshly chopped ingredients.  The creme brulee was likewise ideal. My companion's tagliatelle was reportedly the best ever.  Other dishes were likewise said to be fantastic.    The extensive wine selection here is usually a hit and reasonably priced.  Last night was no exception. Staffed with a crew of well trained professionals with wonderful, welcoming customer service attitudes, this would be a five star rating except for a few minor flaws, the occasional empty glass, the uneven table, the nuances here and there.  But take into consideration that this is a high-end ambiance very well priced, a tough arena in which to compete.  I find myself hoping Panevino doesn't change.  Such a great balance of location, service, menu and ambiance.  We'll be back.",

They were bigger than I thought they would be and most important tasty. Also had a Cadillac Margarita, didn't taste like a Margarita but you could taste the liquor. The service was ok. I would check them out for happy hour again if I'm in the area.",

We were told they were getting us the \"perfect table ready\"  ha. 8:15 we were sat. (Should have at least bought the drinks we had waiting on them) This table was right by the door.  And next to a table FULL of glasses plates etc.  The busboy dumping ground. Service was average at best.  Food good. Expected a lot more outta them for a $500+ tab. Now I know why it had been years since I had been back.  Lovely room, lovely view. Need to step up their game.",

After being seated, we sat for 10 minutes without any wait staff coming by the table and had to ask for a menu.  This was early in the evening and they were NOT busy.  The food was good, but not extraordinary, the service was spotty, the prices were very high for the quality of the food.  If you want a fancy setting, high prices for average food, this is the place for you.  I tried it, but was not impressed.   I am not a huge fan of this restaurant and will likely not return.",

The interior is dark and w low lights.  A romantic spot for sure.  The staff, all of the staff, were welcoming and and friendly.  We started with happy hour cocktails at the bar.  Good prices and a wide and tasty selection.  A group of four, we were seated at a table that was the perfect size where we weren't shifting plates to make room for the next course.  I started my meal w a Gorgonzola and pear salad.  The sweet pears and aged cheese complimented each other well. A delcious treat.  For my entree, a veal ossobuco on a bed of saffron rissotto.  To die for!  Melted in my mouth not sure how else to describe but, if its on the menu and you love tender and flavorful meat, order this.  You will not be disappointed.  The desserts looked wonderful, but i had to finish my ossobuco and there was no room left in my stomach.  I will definitely return here.",

    "text": "I'M FIRST REVIEW?! YES!  saw this restaurant on a bunch of our client's expense reports and decided if it was good for them, it would be good enough for us too. came on a thursday afternoon, and the place was about 1/2 full. it is business casual, btw. and it seemed mostly like a place for power lunches and business deals. made me feel like i'm all grown up.  when we had been seated, a person in our party, who was dressed mostly in black, was asked if she preferred a black napkin. i've never heard that question in my life. didn't even know it was an option to take!   first came the bread - tomato focaccia that was chewy and fluffy, and warm - best i've ever had, and some ciabatta, and some regular baguette. all with olive oil and balsamic. only bad thing - this was never refilled, and it should have been. we wanted more dipping oil!  i ordered the seafood linguine and it was divine! received a small plate for shells as well as a shellfish fork. however, the plate was brought ahead of time, and not with the entree, which made me wonder what it was for. it came with a delicately balanced tomato sauce and more seafood than noodles - which is awesome! scallops, clams, mussels and shrimp. all of which were fresh. not a fishy piece in sight.   our water was constantly refilled, and the waitstaff was extremely attentive (except for the dipping oil).   i am definitely coming back here next time i'm in vegas, even though it's off the strip!   the prices were also decent! i think my pasta was $22? worth it!  OH! and the kicker - the chef is actually italian. spoke italian with a patron. how cool is that?!",

The place was quite empty, but we were appalled by the service or lack thereof. We were seated at our table and waited for 15-20 minutes. Our waiter did not even acknowledge our presence. We got tired of waiting and asked the lady who was busing diishes to get us menus. In the meantime, our waiter was busy chit chatting with folks at a table next to us and basically ignoring us. After we caught his attention, we mentioned that we had been seated for over 20 minutes and were not offered dinner or drinks menus, the waiter just said \"Gotcha\". No apologies, nothing. Same thing with bread. we had to flag him down and he answered in a monosyllable that they did serve bread. The meal itself was fine, but the attitude of the staff was completely insulting.  We cannot think of any reasons why someone would behave in such an atrocious manner, At the end of the day, perhaps it  probably best to attribute this to a callous employee having an off day, but we did wonder if there were racial or xenophobic attitudes at play here.",

He said yes and he was in the office.  After more than 1 hour for dinner and another 15-20 to get our bill paid...NO Mark...EVER.  We left disappointed to thinking of other restaurants to go to next time we're in the mood for Italian.  Too bad...use to LOVE this place.",

They know how to make you feel like number one. If there is an Italian dish that you would like, but don't see on the menu, ask them to make it. If they have the ingredients, they like a challenge of creating other classic dishes.",

    "text": "After looking for a nice restaurant off strip for a group for lunch, we ended up at Pane Vino.  My local friends were thinking we would just have lunch at the deli, but to our surprise the main restaurant was open.  What a beautiful space!  Interesting curvy windows that face the strip and the airport.  The decor was warm and inviting.   Right in the middle of the restaurant is what appears to be a support pole but is a mosaic lady's leg, although I'm not sure you would realize what it was from a different angle.  I am sure at night this is a very romantic space (2 members of our group got engaged there), and it is definitely upscale.  Our party had just come from wine-making and we were casually dressed and a bit rowdy, but that didn't affect the service or our welcome one bit.  It's funny that the other reviewers mentioned the choice of napkins because I made comment to my friend that I loved them!  We all had white napkins, but they were so nicely textured and such high quality - okay I have a thing for linens - that I knew we were in for a treat.  The service was excellent and our 2 waiters had a great sense of humor, although we did not get the table dance we asked for, the cute blond waiter did do a little Irish jig for us!    They had a nice variety of wines by the glass to choose from and reasonably priced at most under $10 a glass.  They brought out fresh breads served with a small dish of olive oil and topped with balsamic.  I had the linguine with seafood, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a light and fresh tomato based sauce.  It was wonderful, especially the scallops that just about melted in my mouth.  Yum!  Nice sized portion, I didn't finish all the pasta, but there wasn't enough to take for later.  The dessert menu read like the best food porn, but we had homemade cherry port and chocolate brownies waiting for us at our friends, so we passed.   It was a great meal, with excellent service in a comfortable space - I can't wait to go back for dinner and check out the view as well.",

Using my Nearby feature on my Yelp phone app while at the South Strip Bus Terminal in Las Vegas, I located this nearest eatery.  With only a couple of hours before my bus departure, I walked the 100 yards to this Deli.  Once I entered, I felt quite welcome.  Most if not all of its patrons were local LVians.  I took a quick turn of the place to see all it had to offer.  All of their salads were well displayed and looked fresh.    I opted for 1/2 a seafood salad - simply because of presentation (you eat with your eyes first).  It looked really fresh.  Taste:  The salad was indeed fresh.  Some of the freshest shrimp, calamari and octopus I've had in LV.  The salad was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette.  Because it was a cold drizzly day, I also ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup.  I know, this is a weird combo; but, it worked.  Staff was very nice and the place was very clean.",

The restaurant was beautiful, lighting was just right and we reserved a booth facing the airport.  Though this place seemed to be a \"boys club\" with golfers and business professionals, all of that testosterone was washed away by the impeccable service and delicious food.   Bruchetta was off the chain in terms of flavor, and the homemade spinach ravioli's were superb. I quality controlled my date's risotto and WOW! Fantastic!

Not exactly budget friendly but a great place to splurge on a swanky evening out without the chaos of the strip.",

The serving staff was outstanding and I never had to request a tea refill as they kept my glass full. The ambiance is very very nice and it's a very nice place for a business lunch or to meet friends. I do recommend it. I need to check out the Happy hour!!",

I expected a heaping size, but I probably could've eaten it all at once (and I don't eat a lot). The bread was good... and it's a good thing because we waited nearly 20 minutes for a server and an hour for our food. Other tables had attentive servers and we got stuck with some guy who didn't know what \"gluten free\" meant when asked. View of the strip was great... but I won't be back. Go to Olive Garden instead.",

I and my wife and two teenage daughters went while on an overnight Las Vegas stay and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The host took personal interest in his guests and in us. The wait staff was attentive and got everything right.  The selection of vegetarian and vegan items, while interesting only to half of our party, was refreshing and, according to my vegetarians, the gnocchi and the spaghetti was great. I had the delicious seared peppered ahi tuna steak with spinach and (I think) lobster mashed potatoes. Fantastic. And the Caesar salad was delicate and excellent as an entre for our other teen.   We would likely go again if we visit Las Vegas. The ambiance was terrific and everyone left happy.",

Beautiful architecture, picture windows, and fantastic views translates into a great dining experience.  Oddly romantic for being right next to the airport.  2.  Service!  Had a 20 + party and they took care of us nicely.  Not everything was plated at the same time, but, I understand.  Good for groups.  3.  Food to ingest!  They have two sides, the to-go and the dine-in. I've never been to the to-go but it appears to be lunch only.  The dine-in side is a bit pricey for the quality, I have to admit.  I tried the blackened shrimp with fettucini in a parmesean cream sauce (about $26).  It was, meh.  Not flavorful at all.    However, I stole some of my neighbor's short ribs and blue cheese mashed potatoes  ($31) and it was heaven. ORDER THAT.  I heard someone else bitching about how gross the lemon chicken was so....DON'T ORDER THAT.   They also give you a bread basket as part of the meal.  I'd pass if you're counting carbs...the bread seemed stale.",

The inside is very comfortable, very relaxing, and yet elegant all at the same time (without being stuffy). Five stars for all of that alone.   Our group of 8 all left very happy. From happy hour drinks in the bar, to many bottles of wine from the sommelier's recommendations, to my Seafood Linguine was filled with good, fresh, amazing seafood and a great sauce. The antipasti appetizer was fantastic with great meats, fresh veggies. Calamari and crab cake appetizer also fresh tasting, and had tons of flavor. Everyone appreciated their meals and left happy and fat, whether they had the Fijian swordfish, cheese ravioli, osso bucco, you name it. After dinner drinks of port and limoncello were the icing on the cake.   Prices seemed a bit high for the pasta dishes (especially those without any meat or seafood), but you pay for quality and atmosphere. Other items seemed more fairly priced. Service throughout was excellent.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch yesterday around noon.  It was very busy, of course - yet the wait to order and receive the food was not indicative of that.  A great start!    I had been to the restaurant side previously, but this was my first time to the deli side.  VERY different than the restaurant, which exudes ambiance with fine dining and a great view, plus the homemade italian taste.  The deli side is cafeteria crossed with restaurant - so very casual and (sadly) no view.  Definitely a great spot for lunch.  Seems to be great for business workers!    LOTS of menu options - and while I am not a vegan, I noticed they have a large selection for those who are.    They have a large selection of salads, sandwiches and hot items.  We tried the seafood salad (my boyfriend had this before and likes it), and I had the cobb salad.  My complaint with these would be the portions.  I would expect a lot more \"salad\" for the price.  However it was fresh and tasty!  Avocado for the cobb was slightly too ripe for my liking (more mushy than I would suggest for a salad, maybe okay as a spreadable for a sandwich).    Sitting near the hot food while eating made us desire a piece of the meat lasagna too.  The sauce was delicious, loads of meat, noodles were fresh.  It came with a side of potatoes that were slightly crispy, and a very good accompaniment.    All in all it was a wonderful lunch experience!  I would definitely go back, probably ordering a sandwich or hot food instead of the salad in the future.    I noticed they have wi-fi too, for those business workers who need to eat through lunch... and desserts for those with a sweet tooth!",

    "text": "Panevino, off-strip dining, on strip prices.  There is no argument that Panevino is a spacious and impressively designed restaurant with an abundance of parking. It has a mid noise level with a romantic-ish ambiance and dim lighting.   Unfortunately the night I visited, service and food was not on par with the aesthetics. Service was slow and servers seemed confuse. Dishes that were ordered came out all together, however the servers had no clue who had what, isn't that service 101? Water was filled, but rather infrequently and several times we were left without water for at least 15 minutes. Empty plates were picked up one at a time? What? Why would they pick up only one and run back to the kitchen? Waiting for them to complete the bill transaction took what seemed to be a decade. Perhaps it was a fact that we were a big group and our total bill being over $600 meant they were getting a big tip regardless, but nonetheless disappointing.   Onto the food! Food prices may seem reasonable for a classy Italian restaurant, but portions represent no value. Four cheese ravioli came with FOUR ravioli, good lord, how can you even get satisfied with FOUR pieces of ravioli, especially for $26. Maybe if they caused orgasms in your mouth then it could be justified, but it did not. The Shrimp and Scallop Risotto ($29) was a better value, as it had just enough protein, but unfortunately the shrimp was overcooked, oh well. At least they served free Italian bread with oil and vinaigrette.   Will probably pass on Panevino in the future, sorry.",

    "text": "I've been here several times and one of the things I love about Panevinos is the panoramic view of the strip without having to be actually ON the strip.  The restaurant, located directly South of the airport offers floor to ceiling windows that give great views of both the Strip and all those travelers coming to Vegas with high hopes of becoming Americas next millionaire, then leaving with their tail between their legs.  The restaurant itself is quite large with the dining area to the right and the bar / lounge to the left.  The lounge is a good place to catch happy hour as it is quite spacious with plenty of stools at the bar and plenty of booths and tables around the lounge itself.  This used to be open to the dining room, separated only by a low dividing partition but I have heard that it is now fully enclosed.  My favorite thing on their menu is their short ribs.  I realize that doesn't sound very Italian however if you decide to come here, I would highly suggest them.  The ribs are served in a red wine reduction sauce and presented over mash potatoes that are whipped with blue cheese.  The sweetness of the wine and the saltiness of the blue cheese are an excellent combination paired with the tenderness of the ribs.  The ribs are very tender and a knife is not required.  If the potatoes aren't your thing, you can always substitute pasta.  IMO, I wouldn't change anything about this dish.  If you're looking to stay a little more to the traditional Italian, the penne vodka is always a good bet.  Their vodka sauce is one of the best that I've had.  Rich and creamy, coats the pasta extremely well, yet leaving you wanting more.  A full bar and a very good wine selection is served as.  The wait staff is knowledgeable on the wines that are served and will offer their suggestions when asked.  One of the draws to Panevinos is their service.  Each and every time the service has been well above par.  From the way one is greeted by the hostesses to the those who are clearing your table, the service is extremely friendly, helpful and friendly.  From the time you sit down to the time you finish your meal, you get the feeling as though you're the only one dining at that time because the service makes you feel special as you walk through the door.  Parking here is a breeze.  Since it is located off the strip and in the front of a business complex, there is plenty of parking available during the evening.  My only knock on Panevino is their pricing.  The beef and fish are priced for what you'd typically expect however their pasta dishes are on the high side.  Portions are decent.....but still a little on the steep side as far as pricing structure goes.  This is definitely a good place to meet for dinner to conduct some business, socialize or to just take in the views and enjoy your time away from The Strip.  One of my Vegas favorites.",

A different server brought us complimentary bread and a short while after that, a different server brought us our food. Once again, for the price you'd expect a bit...'more'. Our meals were on the petite side. Thank god we filled up on bread. When we've finally almost finished our original waiter pops in to say hello and if we needed anything else. We say just the check. Then he's gone for another 15 mins. We had to resort to flagging down another random server to help us.

The Tony salad was a nice mix with chopped romaine, salami, mortadella, provolone, and garbanzo beans in a red wine vinaigrette topped with sliced red onions. A nice light salad.  The Linguini Seafood entree was served with perfectly cooked pasta with shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine and a touch of lightly spicy tomato sauce. A tasty dish with a  nice mix of seafood, however the mussel was not thoroughly cleaned and contained some grit.  The Chicken Piccata was not a winner. It is a Pan-seared chicken breast in a lemon-butter and caper sauce on a bed of roasted potatoes The chicken breast was bland, lacked seasoning and was a tough piece of bird. The dish was unacceptable and sent back to the kitchen. Although the wait staff offered a replacement it was declined. The meal was removed from the bill.  Based on this visit we will not return as there are many other Italian Restaurants around town that do it much better.",

    "text": "First I'm a frequent patron and big fan of Panevino. As a local it's my go to spot for business lunches and dinner when important clients are in town. On any given day I rate them 5 Stars. Tonight not so much! Pretty much every aspect of their normally amazing service was molasses slow, clumsy and not polished at all.  We waited for water, wine, salad, entree and desert. What should have been a 90'ish minute or so meal was THREE HOURS!! Our newbie busser poured regular water into our Peligrino sparkling, apologized and got of another bottle which we were charged for. This place normally has top level service but tonight was the C team.  The restaurant was busy but not jam packed CES level busy. No managers stopping by, nothing remotely special in what is normally a great restaurant.  The food was good. Any business or restaurant can have an off night and this must have been theirs.  I'm not sure what happened but something was amiss and I hope it never happens again/. I'll be back but not if it's like this next time.  Where were the managers?",

I chose the shrimp ravioli mmmmm good spouse had the steak, we had warm bread , for appetizer we had the crab cake mmmm good, then we got the main course mmmmm good.  Food is great and very tasty,  the service is excellent , the waiters were on top of the empty plates.  After we finished eating they came out with a birthday cake for my celebration.   Neatly to say we had an enjoyable evening.   Yes !!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great place to go out for dinner. Thank you.",

Even in the over saturated Las vegas  dining scene where celebrity chefs and master Sommelair's exist in abundance, the team at Panevino over perform every visit we share.  The food is fantastic. The location is not only convenient but with a great view of the strip and the bustle of airplanes coming and going from McCarran. I always enjoy the ambiance and it has a nice romantic feel for those of you trying to light the internal fire. ( I really like that last line ).  Anyway, for me you must experience Panevino. And if you like lasagne OMG. It's fantastic.  Hats off Panevino.  See you next week.",

He's look like doesn't want to work as a waiter. And food which is we ordered beef carpaccio, it wasn't fresh and no tastes. And Chicken & Asparagus risotto was just average taste. I think we can make it more delicious risotto at home easily. And home made Fettuccini Blackened Shrimp hasn't a hearty taste at all. I didn't know what I'm eating actually. Home made pasta was good but sauce was horrible. Sauce was very light, not creamy. The taste more like a only using milk...  Anyway we used to like here but this time was disappointed.

Once we arrived we were quickly seated into a private area. After this, the experience went downhill. We were not seen by a server for approx. 15 minutes and once we were, we were told that our server would be leaving and someone else new would be serving us. Our second server, Ben/Benjamin, was passive aggressive and blunt to our group throughout the meal. Starting with the drinks we all ordered filtered water with lemon and he put the lemon on the table with no words, and reached over us to pour our waters. When we explained we would not be ordering bottles of wine, he announced \"I'm going to just take these glasses since you're not going to use them\" in a very abrasive tone. We asked for meal menus and repeatedly he told us \"I'm on your time. We can order quick if you have somewhere else to be.\" When we ordered our appetizers we specified multiple times that we would be ordering from the plant-based/vegan menu. Our bruchettini was brought to us with cheese, and when we ate it thinking it was vegan, we mentioned it to the server saying that we were given the wrong food and it was not vegan. His response was a cold \"oh no\" and he then walked away without any attempt to make it up to us or an apology. I left the meal early because I was uncomfortable with his service. This situation was brought up to the manager, and we were told \"Your server will be talked to\" but again there was no apology or attempt at consoling us considering we would now be sick after eating the dairy and a special birthday event was spoiled with terrible service.",

    "text": "What a horrendous disappointment! We went to the New Year's Eve Gala, with the 5 course fixed price menu, for $185 per person...beverages, tax and gratuity not included. It would have been a huge disappointment at $85, but $185? The soup and mozzarella appetizer...meh. Nothing exciting there, and could not taste even a hint of curry. The crispy mozzarella was soggy, not crispy. The filet mignon pasta was a joke...it was a glorified hamburger helper...ground (filet?) mixed with pasta and sauce. The sea bass saltimbucca  was a disaster of an entree...it was dry...the best part of it was the bed of greens it rested on. Aside from being salty, it was pretty much flavorless. Boring! The polenta was not creamy...it was gritty.The lamb chops were ok. My husband's were a nice pink color...mine were overdone. They were lukewarm, and the crusting was soggy. They had a stingy smidgen of sauce...not enough to make them memorable, and it was a horrible pairing of these with the polenta, which was also quite bland. The dessert was absolutely disgusting. Soggy, stale tasting pieces of apple...it was too disgusting to even eat. We voiced our disdain, and the waiter returned with a duo of an apple tart and tiny piece of tiramisu, which was one of the worst tiramisu I have ever had! For an Italian restaurant, that tiramisu was a complete embarrassment to the establishment. All the food was dry, like it had been sitting in warmers too long. Our water glasses were dry for an extended period of time (probably because the waiter knew that he would be getting an 18% gratuity automatically added to the bill, regardless of his service). Over all, it was a huge let down, and we would never care to try this restaurant again. It was absolutely horrible, and extremely overpriced. When my husband voiced his opinion to the manager, after dinner, on our way out the door, the manager was condescending and flippant. I gave them one star for the DJ...he was actually pretty good and played some fun dance tunes.",

(See picture) It's a great panoramic view of the strip. The restaurant is located a few miles off so it's nice and quiet with a large private parking lot so you don't have to deal with Vegas parking.   On to the food. Starter was the fritto misto. It was good, but I wasn't wowed. Their wine selection is amazing! This place makes their own pasta. A definite bonus! One of my colleagues got the fettuccini with blacked shrimp (house-made pasta). Wow!! It was delicious. The noodles were silky but still had a nice chew to it. The other colleague got the tagliatelle with short rib (also house-made). Now on to my dish.... The game winning shot... The Ossobuco with saffron risotto. Omg this dish was a beast. The Ossobuco came bone in... WITH BONE MARROW. Yup! I'd say this is the best Ossobuco i've ever had and the risotto was decadent as well. Finished off with a scoop of pistachio ice cream because Vegas.. That's why.",

The waiter was bit odd, however, the service was good, the food was tasty. Shrimp cocktail cooked to perfection, nice Burrata salad special and my lasagna was fantastic and not greasy at all.  I was surprised how such a huge restaurant was half empty on Friday night, however, the better for us as had more wait staff attention.  Only bad thing is that if you are waiting for taxi to pick you up- you are looking at 30-40 minutes.   Would definitely return for another dinner as this seems like a solid option in vegas for Italian.",

    "text": "I had such a disappointing experience last night. I've been to Panevino several times prior and been blown away by the food. I'm vegan and gluten free so it's amazing to me that they offer a plant based menu and label what is gluten-free. I've tried the lasagna and the pesto mushroom risotto. I remember being blown away by the lasagna and thinking the risotto was pretty good but simple.  It had been a few years since I visited panevino last and I wanted to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday. The service was nice enough I suppose but not the most genuine feeling. I added in my reservation that it was my boyfriend's birthday and that whatever to make it a little more special would be wonderful so they gave us a happy birthday dessert plate at the end of dinner which was lovely and a nice touch.  My main issue was the food. I've had the hummus rolls dish several times in the past and it did not taste the same. I remember loving the crispy arugula on it but it didn't have any sort of flavor this time around. I had to salt that dish a lot.  I got minestrone to share and that was just.. not good. I've had minestrone from a can that was better than that.  I should've stuck with what I've known but I decided to try something new for the entree. I ordered the ricotta and spinach dumplings. I swear I got another appetizer. The dumplings were just little balls of spinach that were lightly breaded. Literally just little balls of boiled spinach mushed together. It would've been lovely as an appetizer but for a $26 entree I expected something more substantial and somewhat filling, at least. I understand at these kinds of restaurants portions are small but there was like I said, no substance. I was upset as soon as I received it but I didn't want to embarrass us by complaining about it. It really was not worth ordering.  I ordered the chocolate gelato with warm almond milk as my dessert. Awful. Just terrible. No creativity behind it. Maybe my expectations were too high but I expected a fancier dish than two little scoops of gelato soaked in a terrible tasting almond milk with slivers of almonds and dried cranberries randomly thrown in. I've been more creative than that in my own kitchen. I ended up having to eat around the slivered almonds and dried cranberries because it was too Trail mix for my taste. Maybe if they had gone lightly. Either way not worth ordering. No noticeable effort in that dish whatsoever.. I would've preferred the gelato on its own.  My boyfriend said his shrimp was ok. Minestrone is his favorite food and he didn't care for Panevino's. His prime rib was also overcooked.  I'm very disappointed by the food and experience and if I could go back in time I would have gone elsewhere. It's even more disappointing because of how wonderful it was when I last went those other times years ago.",

We ordered lava cake with ice cream for dessert ($14) which was good and so was the bruschetta we had as an appetizer",

I had been here a couple times prior and looked forward to coming again as I remembered liking the entrees I've had in the past.  This time I came with my toddler which is okay but this is not really a kid (well, toddler actually) friendly restaurant. Our server was slow to greet us, slow to get our order and slow to check on us and even slower to get our dessert order. He wasn't the most friendly, attentive or patient server which service can sometimes make or break your restaurant experience even if the food was great. In this case, food was mediocre.",

As a vegan, I am always looking for great food that meets my requirements for health. We had a great meal here.  My hubby had meatloaf, and I had spinach ravioli. At one point, the manager, Mark Lopez, stopped by to talk to us about our choices. We ended up talking for a long time about how the restaurant began their plant-based menu. It was quite a transition for a traditional restaurant. However, Mark is a committed guy. He really wants to affect the health of the people that come to this restaurant, but the first goal is to make sure it is delicious. He is succeeding. We will definitely recommend them, and definitely be back.  I believe as we get ever more health conscious, the trend towards healthy, plant-based menus is is only going to increase. Other restaurants need to get a clue.",

    "text": "I had a certificate from NPR and I requested Panevino.  I went yesterday for an early lunch that would be my meal for the day.  I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:30 and there was one other table occupied.  Before I left a bit more than an hour later, many tables were occupied.    My server was Erik.  He was great!  He asked me if I wanted to hear the specials but I wasn't interested in what was being offered.  I did ask him the size of the tomato soup because I wanted an entree also and didn't want to overdo it with the soup.  Satisfied it was smaller in size and not a bowl, I ordered that.  I then asked if he had his choice between two dishes which would he get.  I took his suggestion and ordered the bowties country-style.   During this time, I was brought my iced tea and a trio of sliced bread--focaccia, Italian, and ciabatta.  The runner also had containers of EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  I asked him for just the olive oil.  I don't like balsamic mixed with olive oil for bread.  I needed some salt for the olive oil but there was no salt on the table so I did without.  The bread was very fresh and very good.  I had two pieces so not to destroy my appetite.  The tomato soup came and after Erik ground some fresh pepper, I tasted it and it was a winner.  This is not your normal pureed tomato soup.  Rather, it was more like seasoned, squeezed Roma tomatoes.  The soup had good body to it.  A very auspicious start.  Then came the bowties country-style.  After some freshly grated cheese was added, I tasted the bowties.  Great flavor.  Country style means it's served with chicken breast cubes, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, and a parmesan-white wine sauce.  This was very good!  Had this not been my meal for the day, I would have stopped and had some boxed to take home for later.  Instead, I bit the bowties and finished them off.  Erik approached and asked if I was considering dessert.  He got a dessert menu and before handing it to me said, \"I usually recommend the dessert trio.\"  I looked over the menu and he was right on.  That's what I ordered.  I was brought a plate with a demitasse size cup with creme brulee, a small square of tiramisu, and a square of strawberry pastry cream Napoleon.  All three were good, but the pastry of the Napoleon was tough to cut.  There was no flakiness to the crust at all.  This was a great choice for lunch/dinner.  I could look out the window and watch the planes at McCarran taxi to runway 1L for takeoff.  It's across Sunset Road but it was close enough to enjoy the view.",

When we first walked in, the hostess at the front counter was rude and had an attitude. She was playing some kind of game and seemed annoyed that we had walked in. When we were seated a few minutes later (had reservation), it took a while to get our menus. The waiter was very attentive and nice. We started with the Eggplant & Artichoke Bruschettone, which was flavorful. Bread was a bit tough and burned, but yummy enough overall. I got the \"ricotta\" and spinach dumplings, which were interesting and edible enough but a bit bland. Others in my party got the Tagliatelle Short Rib Mario's Style, which was very salty, and the ribeye was fatty. We also had the lobster pasta special. Pasta flavor was good, but lobster was overcooked. Lastly, we had the lambchop special, which was three chops with potatoes. It was good, a little salty. Lastly, we had the chocolate lava cake, which came with gelato. Can't go wrong with dessert! The ambiance of the restaurant is very fancy and has a nice view of the strip, but it didn't make up for the price of the lackluster meal.",

    "text": "Well here is another disappointment. I've heard good things and good reviews, but sadly makes me believe that people here never ate good food (I hope I am wrong) ... Sorry!! The order that I am describing here is not importance, but the sequence of arriving thru leaving. First, the place is nice, good view, location of the table was amazing, but (Vegas) there is a huge billboard with the name of the restaurant that just in the middle of the view. Who do they want to advertise, to people inside the airplane??  Second, the service (Michael) ... Nice guy. Ok service. Third, wine list. Simple, nothing extra ordinary. With a wine cellar so big they could make a more variety. The waiter did not bring the wine for the taste. Just brought the glass full and that was it. Fourth, the food. Most important, but ... I order ossobuco with pasta. My wife order risotto with shrimp and scallops.  The ossobuco had a sauce, it was cold, the meat was warm, the pasta was horrible. Did not have any flavor and you could see the lack of care that was in the plate. Her risotto was warm, not hot, the scallops were ok and shrimp was tough to chew. The seasoning was way to hot for a risotto. Almost a risoto mexicano. No chef, nor the su chef were there. Just cooks. After they noticed that I did not eat they tryed to serve me something else, but the meat was going to be cold or colder and I would eat by myself. Ended up eat just the meat. The manager (I think) came to see what was happening, but I told me I did not wanted anything that I would eat the meat and finished. The check ... In full almost 100 dollars. Paid. There is one place that really need all the money they can get. First and last time they saw mine. O well one more experience to tell you!!",

Our reservation was at 6:30, hostess was very nice sat us, we were given a halloween drink menu and the wine list, and that's where the good service ended, 20 min later we still don't see a waiter, 30min later I'm guessing what was their sommelier came over and asked if we were interested in any bottles of wine, we had an event to go to so some ordered glasses and other cocktails. He tried to walk away because we weren't ordering bottles ( which we probably could have if they didn't waste our first 30min) but we pretty much made him take our orders... 30mim In!!!... Next a man left us oil and vinegar but never any bread... 45min in WE DONT EVEN HAVE FOOD MENUS and still have not seen/been introduced to a waiter... Almost an hour in a man walks up with menus and says \" here you go guys, I found you some menus\" and walks away!! At this point we are dying of laughter, we wish we could have left but with another event to go to we wouldn't have been able to have dinner at all (our reservation was at 6:30 and the event at 9, we figured a little over two hours would be enough time for dinner, the event was ten minutes away).... A full hour in and then guy who dropped off the menus comes backs and says \" so are we starting with any appetizers?\".... We planned to but now we have less then an hour so that's out of the question, as we ordered our entrees we made it very clear to him how disappointing his service and lack of urgency and attention was, he pretty much shrugged his shoulders at us, no apologies, nothing... We finished ordering and still we don't know his name so we said \"hey! What do we do with this oil and vinegar?\" His reply \" you should have bread\"... Someone else brought cold hard bread out.... All the entrees came out together, the small portions were annoying only because we planned to order appetizers but couldn't because of the service...food was okay, one person ordered the filet mignon medium rare, it came out medium to medium well ( but again we can't send it back because they put us in a time crunch so he either he had to eat that or not eat at all).... Dessert time? No... They bring out two birthday desserts ( yes we were celebrating two birthdays in all of this mess) they had a halloween theme to them... He set them down and walked away....ten minutes after they finished those he asked if we wanted dessert menus, we are all just baffled at how unorganized and unprofessional this waiter is....We said we don't have time for desserts ( although again we would have all loved some) and asked for the check, he set down all the checks took payment and said \"have a nice night to the table\".... No apologies, no acknowledgment, no accountability, no nothing, and do they not have a manager, or anyone to check on tables otherwise? What the check did have on it was his name, Erik... So thank you Erik for your lack of professionalism! To end this on a good note, the halloween cocktails were so cute and everyone loved them!",

They offer 22 different varieties of fresh salads and 21 different varieties of sandwiches. You can order salads and sandwiches in half portion. They also have daily special hot dishes and deserts.   I enjoyed both their meaty (prosciutto + salami + capiolla) and caprese sandwiches. However, mixed berry cake was a bit too sour for me. A small plastic bottle of S. Pellegrino water is selling for $4. It sounded a bit higher to me when I saw $5 per half portion of sandwich on my receipt and the latte is only selling $4.50 here!? Next time, I will order coffee or something else to go with my sandwich. Panevino Deli is 3.5 stars in my Yelp book.",

Oh well, we came to try the food and get the service everyone expects when goes out. Otherwise what's the point in getting the experience...About the service: first, please don't forget to give the menu, as we got ours 15-20 later after we sat down, next we ordered drinks and those were served 30 min later. I expect drinks to be served as they ordered, so I could have another one with the meal...but didn't happen at that place. Ordered bread, which was good but nothing special. Once the main meal has been ordered we waited another 20 min for that to be ready and that didn't impressed us at all. Overall, not worth trying unless you expect to experience the place and not the food and service.",

I had a very well made Ol'Fashioned (I am very picky) while my wife had a glass of sauvignon blanc (nice and cold how she likes it). The bar was classy and comfortable and the staff were attentive and efficient.  I met Vincenzo the GM on our way in for dinner. I learned that he was vegan and was excited about serving us a plant based meal. I understand the chef is vegan as well. Cutting to the chase... our meal was absolutley delicious. Service was right there. I never have high expectations with a large group... but Vincenzo and his team delivered BIG TIME!!! Can't wait to go back for a more intimate meal with friends.",

While my husband ordered his beloved spaghetti and meatball, because this is also a traditional Italian restaurant, I was able to order from an amazing plant based menu. It took a good 10 minutes to decide what to order because it all sounded so good. I settled on \"ricotta\" and spinach ravioli with a creamy tomato vodka sauce. It was DELICIOUS! The general manager, Vincenzo, is passionate about offering high quality plant based options as well as the classic Italian dishes you'd expect. My husband loved his dinner too! Also, the staff was great. 5 stars all the way!!!!! We're hoping we can squeeze in one more visit to Panevino before we leave for home.",

Fine dining was a necessity for this meeting. Only the best restaurant in the Entertainment Capital of the World would do. The guests I sat with insisted on lunch at Panevino. I have heard about the restaurant for years and driven by their windows many times, but today I can say I was able to enjoy the fine dining served by the famous Chef Mario Andreoni. Vincenzo Granata, Panevino's General Manager reminded me of diplomat. His character was most charming, with a worldly elegance, and they gave me a tour of the restaurant before the Governor arrived for the discussion. Thank you, Mr. Vincenzo Granata had the style of an Ambassador. He was most welcoming with a diplomatic flare. The dishes assorted with steak, roasted chicken, bean soups and cobb salads, all the dishes our guests ate were electrifying. The taste truly perfection! The service excellent.",

I'm not a fan of overpaying for food, but have no regrets if the food is worth the price. The food is not worth the price at Panevino.  Small portions of tasteless food can fetch $20-30 a plate, which in my opinion is too much. The best part of the meal were the salads, but at over $10 a piece, were hardly worth it. I tried two different pasta dishes, each one underwhelming. The lemon chicken was dry and required a healthy dose of salt and pepper.  If you are looking for a beautiful restaurant and care little about how much the food costs tastes, this is the place for you. Otherwise, you can find comparable food at your local Olive Garden.",

The table was AWESOME, strip views with airplanes taking off...make sure you ask for a window seat!  We started off with this amazing pizza/ pita like bread dipped in olive oil. There was a guy that brought this. There was a guy who took our drink orders. There was a guy who came over to check on our food. There was a waitress. I haven't had service like this in years!!!  They are ALL about making you happy.    OK so food. TO DIE FOR.  I got grilled chicken & asparagus risotto..FANTASTIC. Mom got the lobster & crab raviolis {see pix},   Totally would go back, mom asked if we could go back the next day for lunch.

I've passed Panevino and at one point worked around the corner for years and have always said one day I'm going to try this place. Well that one day finally came, and it was well worth the wait. My lady told me to pick any restaurant to dine at for my Birthday, and though a more popular strip restaurant came to mind I went with Panevino. First let me say Panevino exceeded our expectations. This place is amazing! I personally feel finding a great place to dine that has great food, environment and customer is extremely rare in Las Vegas and Panevino has perfected all areas. Upon entering Panevino the first thing you'll notice is how clean, fresh, casual, laid back and classy the dining area is. To the west of the building there is also a bar and lounge. At around 6 o'clock in the evening they raise the curtains to reveal an extraordinary view of the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran Airport. Customer service is just ridiculously awesome. Everyone you interact with is extremely pleasant and welcoming, it feels like you've been there before and they really missed you. The food is exceptional! We started off with wine, bread and an olive oil with balsamic vinegar mix. The bread was fresh, the olive oil had a rich nutty flavor and I know this sounds crazy but even the water tasted refreshing, not like the typical funny tasting tap water you get at lesser quality restaurants. I love Riesling wine but it is very hard to find in restaurants and if they do have it its not very good. We next ordered Crab Cakes for our appetizer which were crispy Maryland-style crab cakes with honey-mustard dressing, and though $20 for two crab cakes the size of silver dollars may seem expensive, you will definitely want to order more. That $20 will seem like a few pennies for the best crab cakes ever! After being amazed by our appetizer we were extremely excited about our main course meals. My lady ordered the Rigatoni Blackened Chicken which consisted of rigatoni with blackened chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and roasted bell peppers in a spicy tomato sauce. Her dish tasted fresh and authentic. I ordered the Assorted Grilled Fish which consisted of grilled lobster, salmon, shrimp, scallops, tuna and Chilean sea bass on a bed of sauteed spinach and roasted potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce. I experienced a sense of euphoria with this dish lol. All jokes aside, if you close eyes while eating this meal you will feel like you're dining along the ocean side in Southern California. Rarely do we ever order desert because nine times out of ten we get some type of generic brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream, but not at Panevino! We ordered the Panevino Trio which was a tasting trio of creme brulee, tiramisu, and lemon pastry cream Napoleon. Only thing I can say about the desert is try not to lick the plate, it might be frowned upon in this type of establishment. This year my dinner experience was the highlight of my birthday and there is no need for my lady to ask me where I want to dine next year... I'm going to PANEVINO!",

Beautiful inside. Nice jazz musician playing in the lounge.  Service: Just eh.. she was really busy though, she had 10 tables which seemed weird to me.  Food: Overpriced for happy hour (imo!) Chicken fingers were $7 for 3  freaking chicken fingers. $6 for fried mozzerella (just 4 pieces!). Kind of outrageous to call these happy hour specials if you ask me.  Drinks: the martinis were very hit or miss. The coconut cream pie was yummy... the winter punch was gross... The panevino passion was probably the table favorite.",

The staff and manager were enthusiastically vegan friendly, and not only that, they were a healthy whole foods plant based restaurant :D for celebrating our anniversary there, they gave us a special dessert treat at the end. I'd definitely recommend this place for any vegans coming to Las Vegas !",

The cost of a turkey sandwich, cole slaw side and large drink - $14.00.  Wow. No way is that even close to a reasonable price for what was offered; 2. The cole slaw had absolutely no flavor or creaminess; and 3. The wait time the receive the sandwich ordered at 12:30 was almost 18 minutes. Way way too long. Hope they can do better next time.",

    "text": "Panevino was the highlight meal of our 3 year anniversary trip. I'm always skeptical of expensive Italian restaurants in tourist areas, as they're often just using tomato sauce from a can and charging you $17 for it. But everything at this place was perfect. We called for a reservation and asked for a table by the window for the fantastic view of the strip. When we came in, they led us right to a table with a perfect view. The servers were all so polite and extremely prompt with new silverware for every dish we had, refilling our wine and water. The food was SUPERB. My boyfriend looked like we would cry when he finished the rib eye and he said he didn't ever want it to end because it was so good. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli with a parmesan cream sauce, which just melted in my mouth. We also had the bread which was like soft pillows, plus the fried mozzarella which was divine. For desert, we shared a tiramisu, and it was fantastic. If you are looking for a very romantic, low lighting, nice ambiance, great scenic view, amazing food and service, you have to try this place. My mom has also been to their San Diego location and she absolutely loved it as well.",

Let's just say I'm not a fan of fancy restaurants. Even though the meal was essentially free I still felt iffy about paying more than $70 for my meal, and that's without making use of the full bar. It's dimly lit and there's soft music playing in the background. If you like fancy Italian joints and don't mind paying for the quiet atmosphere, then it's a fine restaurant. Just not for me.",

    "text": "I went here on a Valentine's Day date with my boyfriend last night and we were excited because we've driven by the place so many times and never went inside. They were able to accommodate us despite the busy holiday. There is a great view of the strip through the giant windows and the inside decor is modern yet romantic. They have some charming booths set up that face the windows; I definitely recommend reserving those in advance.   Our server was extremely friendly and informative. The overall service is definitely 5 stars.   We started with the scallops and crab cakes as appetizers. The scallops were my favorite and the crab cakes were good but not the best I've had. They provided us with a loaf of white bread (cold. I definitely prefer warm..) with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I had the veal for dinner and my boyfriend ordered the ahi tuna because unfortunately they were out of the Chilean sea bass. This was a downer because my boyfriend chose the place specifically because they had sea bass on the menu. I give both dishes, the veal and ahi tuna 3 stars. For how expensive they were, I expected better, but they were certainly enjoyable. The portions are very generous, so we were able to pack half of our meals.   I had the featured chardonnay and wasn't a fan, so I ordered their glass of riesling. I can't say I made the greatest selections on the wine in general so that affected the overall enjoyment of dinner. I recommend asking the server for a good suggestion on wine pairing.  Overall, I recommend the place for a special occasion. Be prepared to spend some money if you want the full experience and be sure to make reservations or call in advance to check for availability. I definitely suggest the booths facing the windows.",

I had the field greens salad and loved the vinaigrette; my husband had the grilled chopped vegetables over romaine - it wasn't his favorite. I had the ricotta and spinach agnolotti in a cream sauce - fantastic. My husband had the veal osso Buck and loved it. Definitely a restaurant to come back to!",

Luckily, our 2nd choice was available - Opus One.  Other than this, everything else was 5+ STARS.    I actually loved that Panevino was located just outside of the strip.  Not as hectic, more personal, yet still had gorgeous views.  Panevino had the BEST, yes the BEST, Ossobuco I've ever had.  Packed with flavor and paired perfectly with saffron risotto.  I ate the entire dish and trust me when I say you could have rolled me out of there.  I was so stuffed but I couldn't stop eating.  I thought I was done until the desserts arrived.  In the middle of checking the dessert menu, the manager brought out an entire tray of desserts for our table.  My favorites were Cannoli and Chocolate Mousse w/Creme Brulee Duo.  Thank you, Panevino, for one of the best Vegas dining experiences thus far!",

They're always very friendly but not overly familiar.   We both started with salads. I had the Spinach Nani, which might be the best salad ever created. My date had the Pear and Gorgonzola salad, which was outstanding as well. For entrees, I had the Tagliatelle with Lamb Ragu. Handmade pasta tossed with a light, tomato-y lamb sauce.... so perfect. My date ordered the Risotto with Chicken and Asparagus. The rice was perfectly cooked, the chicken moist and tender, the sauce - perfect. For dessert, we shared a cannoli, and while it wasn't my favorite dessert, it was still pretty decent.  I love everything about the restaurant. The design and ambiance is modern and comfortable, and it's never felt stuffy to me. It's a great date restaurant, and is, according to my date, impressive.  I've been to Panevino at least a dozen times over the last 5 or 6 years. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and I've never been disappointed.",

    "text": "My boyfriend chose this place for my birthday dinner after suggestions from his boss. We both got the Prix Fixe menu which was $55 for a salad, appetizer, entree and dessert.  I got the beef carpaccio for my appetizer and he got the bruschettone - his bruschettone blew my Carpaccio away.  My Ceasar  salad was very good and my boyfriend really enjoyed his Spinach Nani salad.  I am not a huge Italian food fan, so I was very worried that I wouldn't find anything on the dinner menu I liked so instead of getting pasta I got the Bistecchine di Agnello which is three Lamb Porterhouse which may be one of the best things I have ever eaten. It wasn't 'lamby' or gamey or tough. To be honest, if I hadn't know I ordered lamb, I would have sworn it was beef - delicious tasty beef. It was so much food I couldn't touch my third porterhouse. Walt ordered the Gnocci and he loved it, I couldn't eat a entire bowl of it, but he sure did!   The staff were very vocal in recommending the white chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate creme brulee as the best choices, and we took their advice. The chocolate creme brulee is a creme brulee sitting inside a chocolate mousse cup, it was presented so nicely with Happy Birthday and Balloons created with fruit flavored sauces. The winner was the white chocolate cheesecake though.  That plate had a flower presentation which was such a nice touch.  The staff was very attentive and even asked if we wanted black napkins because we were both wearing black, which is a detail I haven't seen in awhile. Panevino is in a odd location with a fairly gaudy sign on the street, but the view of the Strip at night is very nice. It would be a great place to go on New Years or the Fourth of July to see the fireworks.  I was disappointed in the lack of selection of wines by the glass, as they really focus on bottles and half bottles of wine.",
