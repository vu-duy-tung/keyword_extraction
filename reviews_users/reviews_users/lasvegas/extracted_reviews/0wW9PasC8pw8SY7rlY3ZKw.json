The catfish was cooked perfectly, not too dry and beautiful color. I opted for double veggies, which makes my meal a little healthier. The flavor of this entire meal deserves a separate review, it was so good. From here on out I'll always be getting the blackened seasoning on all of the selections.

They have 6 or 7 different fish that can be grilled on top of a salad or with side dishes.  The fish is always perfectly cooked.  There are 4 ways u can get the grilled fish. All 4 are delicious, esp. The Verracruz.  Nobody does a better job with fried fish! The bayou platter rules.  There chowder is top notch as well.  Tgey even do beer right.  A frozen 18 oz. Mug of Sam Adam's for just $4.75. Great desserts as well.  The owner is the True American success story.  From Mexico, he started 30 years ago as a dishwasher.  His two sons work at the counter.  One of them says \"man\" a whole lot. My only complaint t about this place is the buzzer they give u to Know your order is ready . Could give one a stroke@ The best part of FKG might be the price!! It would cost you more to buy decent fish that you would have to cook yourself.  Between $10-16 for a beautiful filet.  The orange roughy is great!",

I had the soft-shell crab po' boy and it was delicious, as well as filling. Even the roll was exceptional. The hush puppies were perfection. I was able to trade the french fries I didn't want for another side and chose coleslaw--also perfection, flavorful, not greasy. I'll have to take half the sandwich home next time as it was too much for me to eat at once (I ate it anyway). I took some clam chowder home as it seemed to be a special that day. Told them not to heat it. The next day I found it to be extremely flavorful, in what I think may be New Orleans style. My only recommendation would be to cut back a bit on the salt, as it's not needed and a lot of people are cutting back. They had grilled sea bass for $17 ( their fish entrees are 8-12 oz), which would cost you twice as much on the strip. Interesting sides. I only wish they were in Anthem. Can't wait to go again.",

Our regular stops would tell you we are great customers, tip well.  And are supportive of the community.  We tried this new place based on a eater article of new openings. We stand by our comment and rarely return food and expect a refund.  But the food had no flavor,  I subbed potatoes once they informed us table side that the hush puppy batter wasn't usable (which should have been a sign).  Again it's a clean establishment and nothing against the staff there.  But the food was not good and to in open view microwave food does not represent for your establishment well.  But aside from the microwave the actual taste of the food was a issue as well.  The \"grits\" we presented  as a grit fried cake type thing and lacked flavor. The shrimp and \"grits\" were not good.  The red snapper also lacked flavor and the potatoes I subbed once informed they couldn't do hush puppies were over buttered/garlic and no real seasoning.   Maybe over time they will improve their menu, or maybe not and just blame customers for their bad food.  Reviews are meant to help a business improve their issues or highlight good things so it gives them a guide of good and bad. I hope this additional information helps other customers in the future.",

I wasn't quite sure I got my order correct but the girl on the register said she \"knew what I wanted.\"  I like the fried shrimp, fires and corn and that's what I've had before (along with the sea bass).  What I got was quite a bit different...there were 6 small shrimp curled up on a plate, heavily seasoned, and with zucchini (yuck!) and some sort of bean and rice mixture and scallions.  When I asked the girl about it she said, \"That's how they come and the NEXT time you can ask for substitutes.\"  I ate the shrimp (WAY too hot\" for seasoning) and scraped the zucchini and most of the rice and beans off on to a napkin on the tray.  The best part of my lunch was the strawberry lemonade and cup of clam chowder, otherwise this was a ONE STAR review. .  My sister wasn't too pleased with her shrimp that were far to spicy for her, too.  I had ordered \"bar-b-que\" flavor shrimp for her and I think she got the same thing I did...probably \"blackened\" with Cajun spices.  She took most of hers home but I'd be surprised if she'll eat them.   Not too pleased at spending nearly $40 for this. I'll have to think about this some more before I decide to try Fish King Grill again.",

    "text": "We went this past Friday night on a recommendation from friends. We liked it so much we went back Saturday night. The catfish,gumbos & chowder are great. The hush puppies are the best we've ever had,I had the Lafayette burger Saturday night and much to my surprise it was also excellent. And to help wash it down the tap beers in the frozen glasses for under $5 are a definite plus. One small reason I held back the 5th star,no big deal but the over anxious young man next to the guy at the cash register needs to tone it down a notch or two,consistently interrupts the other people while talking or getting information about the menu. But I highly recommend this place and I have a strong feeling there will be lines out the door soon enough. 2nd review:  Sometimes restaurants in Vegas open with a bang,then things change, usually for the worse. Not this joint. They improve and get better every time,and we've been here over 30 times. Family owned and operated and that shows from the enthusiast,helpful and friendly young men who work the counter to their father Miguel who is a PRO!",

I had my heart set on the Orange Roughy Salad and he wanted to try the Orange Roughy/Red Snapper combo platter. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by smiling faces and welcoming staff. The gentleman at the register answered all our questions about what the fish is grilled with and what were in the different seasonings/sauces you can choose. I still had my heart set on the Orange Roughy, but I was told that they had \"run out\" of Orange Roughy. I was mortified. This was literally the only thing I wanted to try today but they were all out. I don't understand how a brand new restaurant that just opened doesn't even have something that is offered on their menu. Since my husband also wanted Orange Roughy, he couldn't order either. We were both very disappointed to say the very least. We drove across town for nothing. 1 star for not even being able to try the restaurant since they didn't have what we wanted, so we just walked out leaving hungry and disappointed. We want to try the restaurant still, but will probably call to make sure they have the fish we want before coming. Kinda inconvenient.",

As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted. Being a newer restaurant the employees were more than willing to answer menu questions and make recommendations. The employees continued to be very friendly and accommodating while we dined.   The menu offers so many great options, ranging from grilled fish plates to southern favorites to po'boys to salads to fried seafood. Pricing is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of entrees.   My husband and I started by splitting the Wild Hog Poppers which were amazing. Can you really go wrong with cheese, jalapeno, and bacon? The size of this appetizer was generous. I ordered the Snow Crab Leg Platter and was impressed. The crab legs were well prepared and delicious. I also ordered a side of Red Beans & Rice that I enjoyed. It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but the flavors were great. My husband went with a Catfish Poor Boy and loved it. This was enough to ensure a return visit for him. The fries and hushpuppies served alongside were great as well.",

With no lunch specials and no grand opening specials, it was more than I usually like to spend for lunch, but it was worth it in the end.  I'm trying to eat more healthy these days. I went with a grilled salmon salad. Because I got it to go, they put the fish in a separate container. A little wasteful yes, but that helped keep the fish warm and the salad fresh.  For a simple dish, I enjoyed it more than I expected. The salmon was grilled perfectly with a slight char but still tender and juicy. The salad was nice and crispy; it may have helped that I asked for the dressing on the side.  The restaurant is spacious with ample tables and nice decor. I really should just eat in next time, but I have a habit of always taking things to go. The employees were welcoming and friendly.

Very tasty and had a little spicy kick to it.   Blackened catfish plate-nice piece of fish cooked perfectly. Served with grilled veggies and red beans and rice. Everything on the plate was cooked to perfection and tasty.   Catfish and shrimp basket-nicely breaded and crunchy. Fish and shrimp were moist and the fries and hush puppies were crispy.   Service was quick and casual but cashiers were friendly and knowledgeable. The place was kind of crowded too so it seems like word is getting out on how good this place is.

I asked for the chef's Mike recommendation and tried the Orange Roughy with garlic butter with rice and zucchini (healthy and delicious) fish was flaky and delicious not over cooked or dry, jasmine rice is the perfect companion, then another suggestion from manager Lorena the Louisiana basket worth the calories .    Tasty food, great service and good prices",

The just added clam chowder to the menu and have daily specials. The tables come loaded with a variety of hot sauces. Today's special is grilled sea bass and it looks yummy!  The calimari is to die for!  They seem to do a good take out business as several people came in and picked up orders while I was there.  If you're looking for good sea food, fast service at a reasonable price give them a try.  Allen was my server and was very helpful and polite.",

The one and only complaint that we had; is that the gumbo and the seafood chowder were very spicy (to spicy really).  The flavor of everything else was really amazing and I love everything that they did with the Decor of a restaurant in a strip center.  Also, I would like to note that menu pricing was very reasonable for quality food. I will visit again and again but I may not have the chowder or gumbo (spicy level to high) but there are other things to enjoy on the menu and I look forward to my next visit.",

Sturdy but soft bread, perfectly fried butterfly shrimp in a cornmeal based dredge, fresh, crisp veggies, and sauced just right. The chowder was the star for me, deep rich seafood flavor, a decent amount of crawfish meat, loaded with potatoes, celery and onion in a rich creamy base with just enough heat to make my mouth tingle. Their hush puppies are light and crispy and delightful, the first time my wife has ever really loved a hush puppy. Really addictively great.   Wife had the soup and salad combo, she got shrimp jambalaya which was rich and thick with a deep, dark roux flavor and smoky notes from sausage and chicken. Salad was fresh and crisp, no complaint.  Lunch for 2 for around 20$. We will be back soon!!!",

I would definitely recommend trying this place atleast once or once a week like me.                                      Maxx Best",

I ordered the six jumbo shrimp basket and the crawfish chowder bowl. They were both very delicious. The shrimp was battered in a tempura/corn meal which was different to me, but enjoyable. The sauces were tasty too where the cocktail sauce was bright and flavorful and the tartar sauce had just the right tartness. The hush puppies were the best I have ever had. Very light and fluffy with a proper tang.  The bowl of crawfish chowder was very yummy! It had plenty of goodies in the soup yet not so much that you thought you weren't having soup. Just right.  The place settings had plenty of crackers, and condiments. I highly recommend this place!",

You place your order and when it is ready you pick it up and take it back to your table.  But this is not going to keep us from coming back for sure.  See you soon Fish King Grill!",

    "text": "We stopped by after reading reviews and looking at the menu. We came by on a Wednesday afternoon around 2:30 pm. There were only a couple of tables occupied but we knew they normally had a dinner rush. My husband lived in New Orleans for a while and we have eaten a decent amount of Cajun/Creole food and we are constantly on the lookout for reputable restaurants.  My son got the 2 chicken strips and it came with fries, a bag of animal cookies, and a large drink. It came in a cute little boat which satisfied my 5 year old. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavored batter, not too heavy.  My husband got the grilled rainbow trout in lemon butter with spinach and grilled squash and zucchini. He devoured it in a matter of moments. Luckily he saved me a bite and it was well seasoned and moist. The spinach and squash and zucchini seemed to have a lemon butter seasoning as well; very delicious whatever it was!  I ordered a bowl of crawfish chowder and the fried shrimp poor boy sandwich. The crawfish chowder had a wonderful kick that makes you sweat but keeps you coming back for more. It has the same heat reminiscent of NOLA gumbo, such a good burn! Most places that try to replicate the NOLA po'boy usually fall short in the bread and flavor department. If you go for bread that's too hard or crispy, or even chewy, it ruins it. If the sauce is too spicy or overpowering, no thank you. But this seriously took me back to sitting in Jackson Square, eating a shrimp po'boy under the sun. The bread was a softer alternative; the breading in the shrimp was light and crunchy. The mixture of tomato, lettuce, and whatever sauce they used was mouth watering. I had asked for no onions and noticed some were in there but I barely even noticed, it was THAT TASTY! It came with beautifully crisped French fries and two hush puppies, light corn fritters that were pleasantly put down the hatch.  We will definitely be back. Congratulations on making our list!  P.S. The fresh strawberry lemonade is absolutely divine! So refreshing and not too sweet.",

We arrived to find it a small diner where you order at the counter and pick up your order when it's ready.    We came here with a group of 7 and ordered several dishes and wanted to try them all.  We ordered a lot of dishes, including:  Fried oysters Calamari Fish tacos Hushpuppies Gumbo Blackened orange roughy Butter, garlic red snapper  Listed iin order of my personal preferences.  Great food, great staff, and the owner/chef, Miguel, is a heckofa nice guy.    The staff went out of their way to accomodate our high maintenance group who wanted to eat family style and share the various dishes.  The fried oysters are awesome!  Fish tacos too.  Nothing bad in our order, although, as far as gumbo is concerned, our tastes tend to prefer a peanut butter color rioux than the darker color here.  Good bottled beer selection and a few on tap.  Standard soft drink offerings as well.  Kudos to owner for running a top notch place and food.  Fantastic and friendly staff.  Thank you.  We all left happy and well fed.",

The crabs are gigantic and the legs make them look like fried spiders. Tasty, crispy, well-seasoned fried spiders. Two huge sandwich halves, with fries and hushpuppies, are well worth the $13 price tag and I'll cross town for this meal again.  But it took me a few visits to find this magical order. Previous takeout orders for fish tacos and a a grilled shrimp salad were average to mediocre, thanks to limited dressings, a deconstructed presentation, soggy tortillas, etc. The seafood soups look good too, but now that I've found success with the poboys, I'll be sticking to that part of the menu!",

It's a tomato base, so it doesn't have that strong citrus/lime flavor.   My \"go to\" is the grilled orange roughy plate. It's somewhat simply prepared but the flavor is great and most important - cooked perfectly every time. The rice and zucchini/squash that accompanies the plate matches up well.  Service is quick and friendly and I always leave feeling full and satisfied. What more can you ask for? :)",

We both agree that it is one of the best gumbo we've tried and we tried a few. Their platter was also very good! I love that they offer soft shell crabs! The hush puppies were also really tasty, very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside filled with corn and garlic I had two and wanted more! I got the Louisiana platter and it was huge! Definitely big enough for two to share. Everything was fried perfectly and batter was not too salty.  Will definitely be coming back for other items... definitely for more gumbo.",

    "text": "If you're looking for some fish and chips, this is the place to go!  A short drive from the airport and the Las Vegas strip, this gem is located in Windmill Lane Plaza.  Meals cost roughly $10 and up depending on what you order.   You can do takeout or dine in.  When you dine in, they provide you with a buzzer, and you go up to the counter and get your food. The wait for the food isn't long at all which is a plus!  I had the catfish fillet basket.  Good size fish fillet.  Meal came with fries, 2 hush puppies, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which had a good kick to it.  The catfish had a good coating of batter; not to thin/thick, but just right. Fries are either seasoned or regular.  Seasoned fries have a lil Cajun kick.  The hush puppies were about the size of a golf ball and was also good.   Hubby got the 2 piece beer battered cod which he said he liked too.  His wasn't drenched in oil and tasted just right.    Inside the restaurant is nice and bright, with a lot of light coming from the windows.  Got some cute decor hanging on the wall and two flat screen tv's with at least some sporting event on.  The tables are supplied with saltine crackers, hot sauce, ketchup, oh and salt & pepper which they got in corona bottles, (thought that was pretty cool). Near the counter they have a fridge with a selection of beer for purchase.    Staff was nice and friendly, didn't have much interaction with them, but they weren't rude or anything when we ordered.    Overall I'd definitely eat here again.  Hubby and I came here for vacay for less than a week and we ate here twice! :)",

Clean, friendly and spacious.  But the food...YUMMY & excellent!!!!  All 4 of us LOVED our dishes.  2 of us, after the owner generously offered a taste of the jambalaya, ordered that, hubby got grilled talapia plate and my sista-in-law got fish tacos.  We are actually staying a little later today JUST so we can go here for lunch before heading back to CA.  Seems like  a wonderful family owned restaurant and we love to support those business.",

Such a good decision.   The food is great, the prices are reasonable, the place is more spacious than I expected and definitely clean, but what really sold us is how friendly the staff is -- just truly pleasant and kind as they take your order and give you your food. Sounds small but it can be nonexistent in similar establishments.  Toward the end I thought I had left my sunglasses on the table and the woman busing the tables came outside to double check that I'd found them (I had). This is not even a sit down restaurant in the sense that you tip a waiter (you can and should tip your cashiers). So again this kind of service was unexpected and appreciated.

    "text": "Went tonight with my family for Mothers Day dinner. This is a new little place, and man is it good!  I ordered the fish tacos, with tilapia. You get 3, in hard corn shells. You also get a side of beans and rice. The tacos were very good. I am a slow eater however, and by the time I got to the 3rd taco, the fish fell out of the shell. That's okay, I ate it off of the plate. The beans were a little spicy, but super yummy.  My older daughter ordered the chicken po' boy sandwich, and said it was really tasty. She doesn't like fish, so she was happy there was a non-fish option. My son ordered the fried catfish and shrimp, and also said it was really good. His came with two hushpuppies, and he shared one with me. I used to eat hushpuppies at Long John Silvers when I was a kid, and I have to say these was even better! I will order a side for myself next time. My parents both got the fried fish as well. My youngest and my grandson shared a kids meal, cheeseburger and fries. Also glad there was a non-fish option for them. Everyone enjoyed their food. My husband wasn't able to come, so I would love to bring him back.  The decor is a cute nautical theme. Its quaint and cozy, and for it being a holiday, we were happy there was no wait in line at all. The people behind the counter were very nice. We also received a 20% discount because we are a military family, which was cool.  We will definitely be going back!",

The hushpuppies were great, and my wife enjoyed her sandwich (saying the shrimp wasn't overly fried.)  I was okay with my two items, but they were in a little heavier sauce than I would have prefered (and have had other places.)  I'd like to come back and try some of the other items on the menu - definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for Cajun food.",

The veggies were zucchini and squash. Two of my favorite things to eat. The portions were good too!   I was extremely pleased with my meal. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I'm really intrigued about ordering other items off of the menu. Overall exceptional!!!",

The sauces were fresh and bright.  Got the grilled red snapper. Not too shabby. Liked the grilled vegetables, as well as the red beans and rice. Heard they had a great soft shell crab po-boy.

The hush puppies deserve special recognition because they are the best hush puppies I've ever had in my life.    The gumbo and grits were shockingly delicious.  The grits come fried & are a fantastic pairing to the thick & savory gumbo.  I added a bit of Louisiana to taste because I prefer mine with a kick.    I had a fear the grilled salmon would be boring but it was surprisingly perfectly cooked and seasoned.  It was served with a side of yummy vegetables which were also surprisingly perfectly cooked.   Fried okra is difficult to mess up, and this place is no different.  Very solid.    Only matter of contention is the sauce that comes with the hush puppies- in short, it is wrong.  The default sauce that comes is a very off-putting cocktail-esque sauce.  If you order the hush puppies, get a side of the garlic butter.   You'll thank me later.",

Hubby ordered the fried catfish and shrimp and a side of gumbo. He said it was very good- spicy the way he likes it. We topped it off with a big sized margarita with the right amount of tequila and a Bud Light draft. Our son had already eaten before we got there so he ordered the banana pudding for dessert. He said it was very good and I could tell it was cause he was licking the bowl. lol  Overall the food and service was excellent. The server even came to our table to get our empty dishes and asked how the food was. We will definitely be coming back to the King Fish Grill and highly recommend it as well.",

    "text": "So stumbled across this place from a referral from my boss and ordered a fried oyster basket and it came with 6 oysters 2 hush puppies and fries. I read the previous yelp reviews and got the garlic butter on the side for the fries and hush puppies and it was amazing with it. The oysters was huge! Like oysters on steroids and the flavor was good tbh, and it came with a red sauce and tartar sauce. It was really good and I enjoyed it. My partner got snow crabs and it was decent. The staff there was really nice too which I liked. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because once I left the place my stomach was turning and I was cringing. I hope it wasn't the seafood but I was sick for the rest of the day and the next day also. And that was all I ate. I am honestly not in a rush to go back after that experience. Like I said the flavor was good but the feeling after I did not like",

When I searched nearby restaurants on yelp last week this one was highly rated so I figured I would give it a try. Last night my friend and I went to check it out. She ordered the snow crab legs and grits. I ordered orange roughy plate they were all fantastic. I highly recommend checking this place out. It may become my favorite local restaurant.

I ordered the catfish poor boy with a side of crawfish chowder. the chowder was hands down the star of the show, I wish I could've ordered more but I was full. it was thick and flavorful, every bite had me wanting more. the sandwich was great too, they put big pieces of fish in there with veggies and sauce. it came with a side of fries and two hush puppies. even their fresh strawberry lemonade was yummy and not too sweet! the seating was simple and the employees were kind as well. i liked the CHOWDER so much I'm gonna come back tomorrow to grab a bowl for dinner!!",

Includes dishes like seafood gumbo, jambalaya, ceviche, shrimp cocktail, combination plates on fried and grilled seafood, salads, beer and soft drinks.  Reminds me of those coastal restaurants where you also get steam crab and shrimp.  I tried the crawfish chowder and it is on point!  There are hot sauces to spice up your food like franks hot sauce, Louisiana hot sauce, crystal hot sauce, anddd tapatio hot sauce!  Freshly battered, and crispy corn crusted seafood.  Beer on tap!  Check menu for prices, they have great prices.  Tv for sports fans.  Great service.  Hope they can make tacos on soft shell corn tortillas, and of course flour too, since there is only crunchy shell 3 taco order, fried or grilled.",

It's a nice little place with no frills but clean and comfortable. I would definitely go back when I'm in the area again. If you do a check in you'll get free hush puppies.",

However, most places that have jambalaya in Vegas are mediocre or worse. The exception is Oyster Bar, but I don't have the patience to wait in line because of the limited bar seating.  This is the best jambalaya in Vegas, period. It's loaded with chicken, shrimp, and sausage. The roux is flavorful and delivers a well balanced kick. The garlic bread is buttery and toasted perfectly. The service is fast and friendly, plus because this is a fast casual restaurant, the prices can't be beat either.  Well done Fish King Grill. Well done.",

I'm originally from Louisiana so I know po boys, catfish and hush puppies and I can honestly say this is the best one I've ever had in 60+ years!

They give you a vibrating puck for when the order is ready to pick up at the counter.  The seasoning is superior.  You can choose one of 4 sauces. I chose garlic butter. The trout and vegetables were grilled and seasoned perfectly. The red beans and rice side was terrific. I washed it all down with a tasty margarita. I will return.",

This place is really more of a \"fast food\"  kinda dynamic where you order to a cashier and then find a place to sit down. But please note that the food quality here is NOT the same as a fast food. The food here is fresh, made to order and very flavorful.   I ordered the shrimp po boy and really liked the flavors. It came with french fires and hush puppies. The shrimp in this po boy was \" butterfly\"  style and it came with a total of 4 shrimps. This was actually a pretty good amount because they are fried. The shrimp was also very well seasoned. I also ordered the crawfish chowder which I liked. It had a lot of seafood and was very flavorful.   This is a place I would def come to again even though it is a bit of a drive for me. Thank you for the great food!",

However when I thought about it in the category they fall into there definitely five star.   I had a tilapia poorboy with coleslaw and it was really good. The tilapia was grilled and very flavorful. The hush puppies were very good as well with a little bit of real corn in it. I think anybody who eats there would be very happy they did so.   The place was very clean and did not smell like fish. That's a real giveaway in a seafood restaurant. The food took no longer than it should have to be prepared and all of the staff was friendly.  This place is not far from a friend of mine's and the next time I play golf with him I'll definitely come here.  They need to open one on my side of town Summerlin.",

The oysters were quite plump and good.   2. Fried 2 catfish and 4 shrimp basket - sorry catfish and shrimp, but you got overshadowed by the fried oysters.  These baskets came with fries and hush puppies.  I enjoyed the hush puppies because it was light, airy and crispy.  Nicely done FKG.  I also ordered a drink and did my own Arnold Palmer.  The sweet tea was brewed and lemonade is freshly squeezed...yes, none of that fountain high fructose corn syrup stuff.  I also checked in via yelp and got 2 more hush puppies.  The meal cost $38.95 before tax and though it is pricey, the quality food and drink we received were well worth it.  The only thing i wish this place would do differently is to fry their seafood in another type of oil rather than peanut.  My toddler is allergic to peanuts so cannot share the delicious fried foods with her.",

Came here with some friends and was surprised at how spacious it was and well decorated the walls were.  Very friendly atmosphere.  I ordered a crawfish po'boy which came with fries and two small hush puppies (you get two extra if you check in on Yelp).  I also ordered a drink and a side of coleslaw.  The sandwich was tasty, although it was a bit small, it was packed with crawfish.  The coleslaw was good as were the hush puppies.  The addition of Louisiana hot sauce on everything kicked up this meal real nicely.    Pros:  A variety of tasty seafood, served different ways, in a kind and bright atmosphere.  Cons:  Although it is cheaper for seafood, it is a still a bit pricey for your average lunch.  My meal came out to $17.  The drink should be included in the price of the meal and the coleslaw was too pricey for the amount you get.    Overall I did enjoy this place as did my two friends who joined me.  I will definitely be back to trying their other offerings.",

    "text": "So my mom had wanted to try this place for a while since the nail and hair salon she works at is right down the street from them, in the Diary Queens plaza. Hearing good reviews from her customers, she decided to take me and my dad out to try it one night. We got there around 7 or 8ish and it wasnt very crowded, but wasnt empty either. Being my first time there, I didn't know what to get. However, my mom had said one of her customers recommended the Salmon Salad. So we ordered that, and the Sea Bass plate with two sides, plus their Gumbo.   The Salmon Salad was actually pretty good. The salmon was cooked just right and seasoned very well. We chose to get honey mustard as our dressing of choice. Mixed well with the salmon. However, again it's a salad so it's just mixed leafy greens with a slab of salmon on top. One good thing I liked about them is that they have the dressing on the sides in a small cup and you are welcome to ask them for more if you want.   The Gumbo was interesting. The rice and how it was cooked was a bit mushy, but crunchy on the outside probably from being pan-fried. Maybe also, the gumbo sauce itself had made it mushy. Anyways, the flavors were good too. I didn't care for the mushy rice, but I wish there were more shrimp and sausages.   The Grilled Sea Bass was probably my favorite that night. I chose to get it cooked in garlic butter, I believe and it tasted delicious! Very soft, flaky, and smooth. Again, this place really knows how to flavor and season their seafood because this sea bass was very well seasoned! The two sides I chose were the fried okra and corn. I didnt like the fried okra. Unfortunately this was something they didnt really season well; however, the basket is pretty full so you get a lot. The corn came out as a whole long corn. Very plain and simple with nothing on top. I thought they would maybe drizzle the garlic butter they cooked the sea bass in on top, but no. Also, I wish they would've cut it in half, but the workers were happy to do it if you asked them.   Another thing I noticed was how they don't have utensils or plates out in the open for people to get, so if you needed more plates or a fork, had to ask them in the front. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and actually went back a second time just for the Sea Bass plate. For about $16, I thought it was worth it and affordable. It definitely does fill you up, so I would recommend getting that and doing the garlic butter. I tried the Blacken version and it was too spicy for me. I didn't really like how overly spiced the sea bass was.",

When I took the pickles off it tasted better. The basket was seasoned and cooked well. Neither one of the items were great, they were just ok.   I will say, the place had a decent amount of customers so maybe we didn't order the right stuff. While we were ordering, I saw a salmon salad that looked really good.

The staff is courteous and knows the menu well enough to provide recommendations. Now on to the food.  I had the four shrimp, one catfish basket, spicy. The catfish was fresh and tender. The cornmeal breading was flavorful but not overpowering. The shrimp were pounded flat but were not rubbery. Again, very fresh. We also ordered the grilled chicken and veggies. The chicken was grilled to perfection; moist and flavorful. The veggies were also fresh and and very tasty.   I only want to add one more detail: the hush puppies are life changing.

His sons are a bit awkward only because innocence is very much within them and you can tell that interaction with new people tends to make them a bit nervous but I'm sure they'll grow out of it; I love em' anyway!

Second, for a seafood place, it's not that expensive so I'll be going broke soon with all the numerous trips I'll be wanting to do here. Third, if you love seafood and don't try this place out, your tastebuds will hate you forever. I'm big on seafood and especially poboy sandwiches and this place nailed it. If I could give them 1,000,000 stars I would. It's that good. They also have a wide variety of selections on the menu and their shrimp poboy with a side of fries and hushpuppies was like crack for my tastebuds. I'm like in seafood heaven right now and I hope this place never ever closes or moves. I actually hope they open up more locations all over the valley because it should be illegal if they don't.",

I checked out their menu and I knew I had to try it.  I was wonderful and the people were friendly.  I had the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail.  I've been eating low carb so that was a good choice for me.  It had the right amount of spice and was big enough for a meal.  My husband had the fried catfish and said it was as good as some of the best places we had in the South.  The restaurant was clean and even though they had a lot of fish items going on it didn't smell like it.  That usually a good sign that the fish is fresh.  I found me a new favourite place!",

I did take out some of the greens and tomatoes as the sandwich was insanely thick. Their tartar sauce is excellent.   Staff was kind, generous, and informative.

My first visit here, we were celebrating a birthday and the celebrant was craving seafood. Because we were a large group, we had to find a place that wasn't too expensive. When we yelped seafood restaurants near the office, this gem popped up. When we first arrived here, it wasn't what we had expected. It was a very casual dining experience. A nautical theme is their interior decor.   On to the food. One word...delicious! Because we were a large group, I had the opportunity to taste a number of dishes in one visit. Either I was really hungry or the food was truly delicious. I'm going with delicious because everyone loved all their dishes. The Jambalaya was very flavorful and packed with delicious ingredients like shrimp, chicken, sausage and more! The bacon wrapped jalapenos, calamari and hush puppies were on point as well. Each cooked and seasoned perfectly. Trying to stay on the healthy side? No problem, they have grilled options. I tried the blackened salmon, boiled shrimp, and grilled zucchini's. Yum, yum and yum! On another trip, I did a take out order and ordered the beer battered onion rings, fish and chips (beer battered cod), and jumbo shrimp. They did not disappoint! Because we got home a while after picking up the food, I threw them on a tray and popped them into the oven and they were just as good as if you were to dine in.   I'm already planning on what to order on my next visit.",

This restaurant is one of those walk up to the window and order type. They give you a buzzer and you come pick it up when the food is ready. Their prices seem pretty comparable to other seafood restaurants and they have a well balanced menu from salads, fried fish baskets, grilled options, tacos and even burgers for those who aren't into fish. The staff was super friendly and every single one of them had a smile on their face.  I went with the soft shell crab po boy and holy cow it was amazing! It was perfectly fried and the seasoning on the breading was phenomenal. It had just enough spice to take it up a level but wasn't overpowering. The sandwich was good sized and it came with french fries and two hush puppies. I would definitely recommend it!",

It didn't take long to finish making our food, but it was standard Sysco fare. The fish and chips was about a half click better than I could get out of the supermarket freezer. The fries were as plain as you can get at any bar in Vegas. The hush puppies were about the best thing I had and they were mediocre at best.  I'm not saying the food is bad, it was alright. If you are looking at getting your Cajun fix on a budget, this is a decent option. The interior is clean and the noise level was low, so you can carry on a conversation. It's also big enough to bring a group to if you are in the mood for straight out of the box seafood. This would be a great place to go after a night at the bar (if only they were open later).  I didn't know what to do with my tray or dishes when I was done, so I guess you just leave them on the table. Mildly awkward.",

Grandma and I each had the 3-piece fish and chips, which came with tartar sauce, lemons, and 2 hushpuppies. It was delicious! Everything tasted super fresh and flavorful. Nothing tasted oily or like old grease. I'm definitely getting a basket of hushpuppies next time. They're perfect! Crispy outside but fluffy inside, a little sweet, a little salty. No gross oil taste. Definitely get extras to share!  Best of all, the service is top notch. They are so polite and friendly. While waiting for our food, I noticed that they sincerely thank each person and say something about appreciating you coming in, which is a nice touch. They have two big TVs that were playing basketball and hockey, which is a plus. The beer selection (bottles and tap) is big too! I wasn't expecting such a selection, but they had shandies, bocks, imports, and your usual Bud, Sam Adams, etc. Definitely a winner!",

    "text": "Most people think of Las Vegas as being where all the great places to eat in town are, and people would not be wrong! To limit oneself to Vegas, however, would mean to ignore many of the hidden gems out in Henderson, including this Cajun and Creole-based seafood restaurant on Windmill and Bermuda! Located in the same area as the now shuttered Bachi Burger, Fish King Grill is one of the most surprising places to find affordable seafood -- and doesn't skimp on the quality! Little wonder it makes my list of personal favorite restaurants in town.  As mentioned before, Fish King Grill focuses on seafood prepared Cajun and Creole-style, with many recognizable items like jambalaya, gumbo, po'boys and hush puppies on their menu. They also have healthier options such as grilled fish or grilled seafood for those watching their weight, and the more adventurous can get items like fried oysters -- and this is one of the few restaurants I've seen that offer them!  For my review, I focused on three items: the clam chowder, the green beans, and the jambalaya. You generally get all of your food at the same time, so you won't have to worry about waiting too long for your food, at least.  Of the soups, the crawfish chowder and the gumbo are the more popular, though I opted to go for the clam chowder since I hadn't tried it before. What a great decision -- it was thick, hearty, and full of clams and potatoes! This was definitely a far cry from other clam chowders I've tasted that were either too watery, skimped on ingredients, or both. The green beans were also tender, but still had a nice crunch to them -- both items are not what I usually order here, but they're both delicious in their own right.  The jambalaya was more in line with what I usually order -- and it comes with rice and garlic bread. It was both savory and spicy, and deeply satisfying to eat by itself, but with the garlic bread and using it to dip into the jambalaya -- that makes it so much better in my opinion.  Much of the restaurants catering to Cajun-style food are either on the Strip or in the general region of downtown and the west side, which makes Fish King Grill a welcome addition to that collection of restaurants, especially here in Henderson! They have more than just these dishes on the menu, and as I said before, there's something for just about everyone here! Of course, this is just my take on it -- so why not try it for yourself?",

Fusion of New Orleans and Southern Style seafood (I was raised in the south) and of course Rico Mexican influence too! You will not be disappointed. MIGUEL is a master chef. I'm gonna try every single thing on the great menu ! Loelito",

The serving sizes were generous, the seasoning options gave us choices, and the sides selection was broad so you could customize your plate to fit any taste.

My boyfriend has been craving some good southern cooking so I did a quick yelp search & found this place just a few minutes from home. I've driven past several times & just always assumed that it was almost like a fish market. Boy was I wrong !  Upon entering, we were greeted by a gentleman behind the counter who welcomed us with a little small talk. Customer service is a definite must for any place & they definitely hit the nail on the head.  The decor and seating is very casual, so don't expect anything fancy. The food: I ordered the fried shrimp basket with fries. I've never had fried shrimp with so much flavor! Definitely a fan  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun pasta & he stated that it was the best he's had in Vegas!  If you're looking for a new seafood place to check out , check out this place because you definitely won't be disappointed !",

Ceviche is really great, BBQ shrimp is excellent nice and tangy, the burger is surprisingly good as well.    They also have a frequent diners card which I have already filled a few times.

HOWEVER, I overlooked it since my friend got me deep fried Catfish & Chips rather than Cod & Chips. Turns out they DO NOT have Cod:-(  I decided to try it again (6/22/2017) and it was even WORSE in my friend's & in my opinion.  This time I asked for the (UNAVAILABLE) Cod & ended up ordering Deep-fried Trout & Chips, a tasty fish that I grew up on:-) A couple of bites of fish & fries and I was FRUSTRATED AND DONE. The fries were as soggy as any I have ever had. The fish was ALL BATTER and very similar to the taste from my 1st unpleasant go round. I RARELY post a YELP review but the 2 that I have posted were necessary in my opinion in order to inform potential patrons. Mark Stensgard, 714.240.2552",

It comes with fries and hushpuppies but I wasn't really feeling too much fried foods in one meal so I asked Miguel over the phone beforehand if it was ok to get beans and rice instead of the fries. And he happily said that was ok! The food was awesome but what stuck out the most was the hushpuppies these were the best I ever had! The catfish and shrimp were so good and idk if they make their sauces in house but they were also so yummy! Rice and beans were delicious as well. I also tried a cup of their crawfish chowder. So good!! Everything was on point. WELL DESERVED 5 stars!! Thank you Miguel for letting me sub fries for beans and rice it balanced my meal out perfectly! Will definitely be back!

Jambalaya was delicious but could have been just a little warmer; however, the shrimp were perfect, peeled and plump, and the overall flavor was excellent.  Calamari were small, which is fine by me, tender and crispy, and plenty of them; very good.  Clam chowder is very good, but more of a Cajun/Creole style seasoning than New England style; lots of clams though.  Crawfish chowder is very similar.  Beans and rice side was a little bland for my taste but still good.  Extensive menu.  No \"fishy\" or old seafood from what I've had and could smell, and all cooked perfectly.   I haven't tried the grilled fish yet, but it looks great from what I saw at other tables.  I'm looking forward to trying it.  Key lime pie was nice and tangy!  Yay!  Atmosphere is close to a fast-food kind of place with plastic table trays that you pick up when your order is ready.  Nonetheless, it's clean and perfectly acceptable.  The hard surfaces reflect a lot of noise, so you can hear what everyone in the dining area is saying; don't come here for privacy.   The order-ready buzzers will scare the hell out of you when they go off, but at least you know your order is ready.  Looking forward to trying more from the menu.  I'll be back.",

    "text": "What a great new little mom & pop place for seafood! Having grown up in the south, sometimes you get a hankering for some old fashioned cornmeal fried catfish. Stopped by on a Friday night, and I was surprised to find it so busy for a brand new restaurant. A great sign! Clean and spacious, there's plenty of room to dine-in, but I witnessed quite a few people ordering to-go as well.   I ordered the 2-piece catfish fillet basket and a cup of crawfish chowder. Let's start with the latter: wow! So much flavor in this little cup of chowder. Rich and hearty, there was plenty of celery and potato. More crawfish would be nice, but there was so much flavor (from a fantastic roux) that I didn't really care. Anyone who eats with me usually knows that I love to re-season my food when it gets to the table, but I didn't have to do a single thing to this chowder. It was perfect for me.   The catfish basket delivered on all its promises. The fish was fresh, tender, and juicy. The cornmeal batter was light and flavorful but not overly salty, and surprisingly not oily! The basket came with a good amount of fries (which were cooked perfectly for me contrary to other people's reviews), a hushpuppy, and tatar and cocktail sauces. If there was one criticism I had to give, I would suggest including 2 cups of tartar for 2-piece baskets. More fish would require more sauce, and it would be inconvenient for customers to have to ask for more.   Each table includes a generous tray of condiments to suit everyone's tastes, from salt and pepper to an array of hot sauces: red and green Tabascos, Cholula, and Louisiana Hot Sauce. The nautical theme of the space is calming and cute, and there's plenty of parking. After ordering at the counter, you're given a pager to notify you when to pick up your food. Tap and bottled beer, wine, and frozen margaritas are offered for your adulting pleasure. For healthier eaters, there's a large selection of grilled items if you want to avoid the fryer.   I am excited to return to try the catfish po' boy, grits and gumbo, jambalaya, fried okra, and creole pasta alfredo.",

    "text": "A new seafood place? I'm in! This is a nice little gem, inside the plaza across from Vons. It's spacious and airy inside, with lots of light and the requisite nautical accoutrements on the walls. Plenty of tables are available to accommodate large parties.   They informed me that their seafood comes three times a week, from Mississippi and Louisiana. As catfish, crawfish and hush puppies are prevalent on their large menu, this isn't much of a surprise..LOL.   They were kind enough to let me taste the crawfish chowder, which was very savory and full of seasoning, with pieces of crawfish tails, and chunks of celery and potato. Being more of a clam and fish chowder kind of chick, I'd have to be in the mood to get this one, but I will definitely get some when the yen strikes me.  I decided to order the single fried catfish fillet basket, that comes with fries and hush puppies for $8.99. They allowed me to exchange the fries for sauteed spinach (sauteed in garlic butter, mind you) for no extra cost, and still threw in two HP's.   The fillet was crusted in cornmeal and was a good size for the money. It was light and moist, and not greasy at all. There was tartar sauce, cocktail sauce and lemon in the basket, along with a host of other condiments available on the table.  The HP's were good, but as I'm from Boston and don't have much experience  with them in the first place, I can't really elaborate other than that I was willing to eat them..LOL.   They have everything from salads, sandwiches (\"poor boy loaf\"), fried and grilled baskets to apps, combo baskets and boiled platters. They're happy to explain things and make recommendations as well.   All in all, this seafood critic is satisfied and would return. My only reasons for not giving five stars are that they don't have a lunch special menu, and that almost no one gets five from me because I'm a super picky bitch who isn't easily impressed..LOL",

Service is quick and staff there is very polite and helpful. I usually order the Creole Pasta Alfredo, it's by far my favorite dish on the menu. I usually add hot sauce from the table on it, but it still has a decent spice level on it's own. The Jambalaya is good as well. Seafood Gumbo is rich and tasty, but I added hot sauce to that as well. They also have a loyalty program and local coupons available, so for the price it can't be beat. Given we live in a desert, when you can get seafood this good with these great prices, this place is a True gem. I will continue to be a regular here.",

The fish comes with a good tartar sauce.  I love they have hot sauces on the table and the Louisiana hot sauce was my favorite on the fish.  The batter is a corn meal mixture.  The hush puppies are homemade perfection.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  It cost me $28 for two meals.  I noticed that most are getting the chowder and gumbos.  I cant wait to return and try it.",

Louisiana Basket (spicy): shrimp were lightly breaded, succulent, and easy to bite through. Catfish was tender, clean, and buttery. Hush puppies were crumbly, but not too much, and had just the perfect amount of sweetness. Fries were so crispy and so wonderfully seasoned, they may be our favorite fries in the city. But the fried OYSTERS... oh Fish King... all hail to thee for your oysters. One cannot explain the joy in the tears that ran from my eyes as I bit into that juicy, briney, gem from the sea. Heavenly.   Coleslaw: lightly sweet, lightly dressed, crisp, refreshing, palate cleansing.   Strawberry lemonade with sweet tea (strawberry palmer): knock out!  Bread pudding (to go): wish I had more room to eat it in house, but it was fantastic after we got home. The anglaise sauce was thick and buttery. A+  Our first trip will not be our last. Shout out to the daughter working the counter that talked us into the spicy basket. Killer!!",

My husband and daughter had catfish, french fries and hush puppies with strawberry lemonade.   Overall, the food was good.  I literally just had a few fries and a medium strawberry lemonade. The fries were crisp, fresh and hot...which is a plus, but it had no seasoning...a little salt corrected this \"issue.\" As for the drink, the strawberry lemonade could have been slightly sweeter (I realize that flavors may be adjusted to meet the needs of various  individuals).  My husband and daughter enjoyed the catfish.  They said that their fish was well seasoned, fresh and hot.   The food was prepped quickly and the customer service was great!

It was cooked perfectly and was very fresh. My sides were seasoned good and were excellent Overall, this place is a very good value for the quality of food. Restaurant is spotless and has a nice decor. Would recommend giving it a try if you're in the mood for seafood.",

First the basics: The Big \"A\" from the health department, spotless restaurant (all tables were cleaned and the floors swept), spotless (Mens') restroom (with hot water too) and friendly service.  I heard several Sirs before we even sat down.  We had the salmon which was well prepared over rice (garlic and buttah!).  Fish and chips were very good with spectacular tarter sauce.  And the crab legs with potatoes and corn on the cob were delish!!!  We are now regulars.",

I have to say, as good as the sandwich was, the gumbo was great. And they don't scrimp on the shrimp. Price was reasonable (some would even say inexpensive given the ingredients).",
