Bam, eggs haven.  This is not the only place in LV.  This place is basic and quick.  Not much to look at but the food hits the spot.  Many of the items on the menu are similar to other places.  The hashed brown was not exactly what we had expected - didn't like it.  One of the order came with a coffee cake and it was a slice of warm buncake with sweet filling.  Strange and strangely nice.  It would be nice to try many items on the menu if I can.  Since this is only 1 exit away from my friend's place, I think it can be done :)",

    "text": "First of all I would like to start off by saying how much I used to love the Cracked Egg. My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...  BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.  My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.  The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug \"don't care\" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is \"the food industry and that bugs happen\". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, \"well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared.\" !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for \"politely\" complaining, she said, \"ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too.\" That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!  I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.  NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed.",

The restaurant has to be clean, have good food, creative menu, and great service.  Extra bonus to a family owned restaurant and not a chain.  This place fit the bill.    I had ham and eggs, and the ham was big and thick, not bone in, but very flavorful.  Eggs cooked just right, seasoned potatoes were perfect.  Was a great place to stop for breakfast.  They also have a senior menu which was perfect for my family members traveling with me.",

It left such a bad impression I probably wont be back... I got the \"Lighten Up\" which was okay but really not worth the $9 for eggs and country potatoes.",

We hit this delicious place up right before we left back to Phoenix and damn..  that's all I can say.  DAMN DELICIOUS!  You go inside this place that happens to be inside of a strip mall and right away it has that home cooked meal feel to it.  The friendly staff seats in a booth (which we always prefer) and we get the drink orders out of the way.  I love iced tea, but their tea wasn't the best. Trust me, Im not knocking down stars for that. lol.     As I look over the menu, I always find myself always getting the same type of food.. omelet or pancakes with some sides.  I decided to go out of the box and try something new.  Ready for this?  Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast...     Yep..  I ordered that and let me tell you how amazing it was.  It was about six good sized slices that were filled with peanut butter and grilled to perfection, topped with bananas and honey, finished off with some hot maple syrup.  I was in breakfast heaven.    I could have easily split this meal up with someone and didn't finish it, but I highly recommend it.. especially if you love peanut butter!  i cant wait to get back to this place!",

The Croissant breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites and so is the Garden Patch omelet.  The staff is always friendly and the wait for seating usually goes by very fast. They are very busy Saturday & Sunday mornings but they tend to get through the crowds fast.  If you join their Rewards program, they send you an $8 coupon every month.

It's more plain cake than it is the topping (aka, the part we all love).  Also, know that you cannot request a flavor.  I ordered the Country Benny and it was savory and satisfying.  The sausage gravy had great texture (not too thick/not too runny) and flavor, which is difficult to find on this side of the country!  The biscuits were soft and the egg was cooked perfectly.  I wasn't impressed by the seasoned potatoes, but after eating the main entree, I didn't have much room for them, anyway.  My companion ordered the Mexican skillet and seemed to enjoy it- I didn't try it, so I can't comment.  I would visit again, but I definitely think I'll skip the coffee cake next time!",

It is a chicken fried steak over a bed of house potatoes, smothered in delicious gravy and topped with copious amounts of cheese. I usually order the two eggs that come with in on the side rather than on the skillet.   I am not a fan of their omelettes. I think they lack a little flavor and flare, especially for the cost.   One thing that is great here is their coffee cake. They usually have a different flavor every time I go.   My main complaint about this place, aside from their omelettes (I like omelettes with meat, and their big bad wolf omelette (or whatever it is called) is definitely not laden with meat as you are led to believe) is that their service is slow. While I don't work there so can't know for sure, I would attribute it to how busy they are and a staff that is not large enough to handle everything. They also have a waitress there who never seems to like what she is doing. When I go out for breakfast, I don't want to deal with other people's problems and bad moods. That needs to be checked at the front door when the waitress comes in to work.   Aside from that, I do like this place, especially their chicken fried steak skillet.  Would I recommend this place to others? Yes.  Would I come back here myself? Yes.",

There are so many food options in Vegas and Henderson that to be treated with poor service, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.   It started from the moment we walked in. For some reason the hostess had an attitude, barely said two words to us, walked us to the table, put our menus on the table without a word, and walked away. Then it took about 10 min before anyone came up. Mind you this was 1:15 on Friday. By no means busy. We were ready to order, and I told the waitress we were in a hurry because we were on a lunch break. I ordered the Monte Cristo which clearly states on the menu comes with hash browns or home fried potatoes, something like that. When I order, she says do you want French fries. Threw me off because that wasn't a choice. Then the coffee cake was burnt on the bottom. Why would you even serve that. That's always been my favorite thing there. We ate the top but it just wasn't as good. You could clearly tell there was a problem with it and she never asked about it the entire time we were there. In fact, she left the plate with all its burnt crumbs on our table the the entire meal. It's like she wanted us to be taunted by it.   Then the food came about a good 15 min later. We are starting to panic by this point because we have to get back to work. There is no way all of this should have taken closer to an hour. I have a deep fried sandwich for crying out loud. I swear she put our food in late. We know that doesn't take that long. When the food comes, I ask for the check right away, and my daughter asks for ranch. She's brings the check but we never see the ranch nor do we see her again. Not once. I had to ask a bus boy for a container for the rest of my sandwich. Which by the way the sandwich was burnt as well. Very crispy.  You have to pay up front. The person up there asks how it was, and I said \"not good\". She either is inexperienced on how to handle that response or she just didn't care. All I heard in response was her mumbling under her breath \"oh sorry to hear that\" as she's facing the cash register ringing me out. That's it. We'll take our money elsewhere.",

Sometimes the hash browns  are a little underdone, and they have a heavy hand with the cheese, but that's the exception, not the rule. The coffee cake is okay, it's more like a vanilla cake than a sweet bread creation. It's only my preference, however.   What really shines is the service. Juan is probably the best waitperson ever, he makes sure your coffee is always topped off, checks back frequently, and if something isn't right, he has no problem fixing it. Never grumpy or distracted, and even when he's super busy he still takes care of you.   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I came here because a lot of people I know say it's a good place for breakfast. It's decent at best. I'll give you the rundown.   First: If you come here on a weekend, expect a wait time. My husband and I had to wait 10 minutes for a seat, which honestly isn't terrible...but still meh. There are cool little stores nearby to kill a few minutes in.  Service: The service was good. That was one thing I enjoyed about the place. Our server was ready to recommend items and substitutes for entrees at the drop of a hat. In fact we saved a little money from it. BONUS!  Price: This area made me sad. You get a lot of food, yes, but everything was overpriced. I got a Joes scramble which was about 10 dollars. I could have made it at home for a fraction of the price. Their coffee is 2.25 for a cup. OUCH. I'm used to being kind of tight with my money, so everything on the menu made my wallet cry. Especially since you can make a lot of it at home.  Quality: The quality of the food was good. On par to what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. The portions are good and everything is well cooked. The eggs are fluffy and the potatoes weren't overcooked.   Overall: It was a decent experience but once was more then enough for me. There are other places to go for a good breakfast and that cost half as much. I suggest going there once to try it and judge yourself.",

My first time ever trying the dish and I will need to try it elsewhere to see if i still dislike it. I could say that without ever having it before, I'm sure it is suppose to have some flavor. The holandaise sauce was just a visual effect, nothing to it. Every bite tasted like egg yolk and that's it just bland as could be. The potatoes did have seasoning and flavor and are worth ordering. I felt it was overpriced as well. My wife had pancakes and 2 eggs(sunnyside not over easy as ordered) with bacon coffee and one orange juice( i would of had another but the no one came back until we were finished) and it was over $30.

    "text": "This is easily one of the best places in Las Vegas/Henderson to eat breakfast (also serves lunch, closes at 3 pm). Entertainment Book coupon participant. This one is located in a large strip mall. We've eaten here before (but I don't remember what I ordered) with my FIL and his wife. But it was a while ago. We were seated within 10 minutes for getting our name on the waiting list. Last time, there was a much longer wait. My FIL said it was the slowest he'd ever seen (they were regulars).   Our drink order was pretty quick. Our server came up shortly afterward. We were talking a bit, and it seemed like the food came out pretty quickly too. My FIL got the Monte Cristo-turkey, ham and swiss dipped french toast batter and deep fried (never had one, but it looked interesting- my FIL enjoyed it, it's his favorite thing to order here), his wife got the Veggie Benny- sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs in hollandaise sauce (looked very generous, she only ate half), I got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash- I only made a dent in it (the biggest of the bunch, came with 2 eggs/scrambled, seasoned potatoes andfresh warm coffee cake- hash browns and toast are also options), and my husband got the Tori's Tortilla- large flour tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo, green chiles and onions topped with salsa, cheese, and sour cream; jalapenos omitted- he didn't finish it (breakfast type burrito, my hubby loves burritos). It was delicious. The corned beef wasn't fatty, and the peppers and onions were a nice combination, but there was also some hash potatoes underneath the eggs and over the corned beef. The seasoned potatoes were perfect, not mushy, not greasy, and firmly cooked, just the way like it. This was a big meal, so I ended up taking the rest home; I'm pregnant but if I overeat, I will not feel good. The service was very good, our server checked on us several times and got us refills.   Large portions, most breakfast items are $10.95 and under (maybe about 3 items are over that range). Good service. Great place for breakfast (in the same class as Omelet House and Jamms). Glanced at the Lunch menu, most items under are $10.95. 4 locations in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.",

My fiance ordered the parmesan potatoe soup & 1/2 sandwich & I got the club sandwich. The soup was perfect. When I say perfect, I mean it! I love salt & this soup had the perfect mix! With bacon & scallions on top. 10/10. I must warn you, if you get the club, prepare for a monster sandwich to be set in front of you! This thing had three layers of deliciousness in a perfectly toasted package. The avocado was one of my favorite points & was perfectly ripe. I would make a point to visit this place again!",

The seasoned potatoes are a great accompaniment.  Yummy.  You have your choice of toast or coffee cake.  I always get the homemade coffee cake.  It changes everyday and would highly recommend getting this.    Service can be a little spotty but I'm guessing it's how busy they are.  It's not bad though and won't hold that against them.

The only issue that I have, and why I gave 4 out of 5 stars, is because there is no organization or management of people coming in and the people going out.   Since the restaurant is set up for the diners to pay as you leave, there tends to be a crowd of people milling round the front reception area during their peak times, and you are never quite sure who is coming and who is going.   Therefore you tend to run the risk of someone cutting in front of you because they don't understand that you are waiting to pay - which is what seems to happen to me on a regular basis.",

This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.  The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.  This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.     I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh.",

Don't let the wait turn you away!! No matter how many people I see outside, I've never waited more than 20 minutes. The crowd also comes in swarms so you may see a line when you get there, 5 minutes later you'll be the only party waiting.  First of all order the coffee cake. Orders come with the option of toast or coffee cake and you should never choose toast. You can make that at home. The fresh baked sweet coffee cake with marmalade center, you just can't.  The portions here aren't too big, with Egg Works portions being bigger, but I think the quality is better. Also, the coffee cake is better.

They staff was super attentive and I never had to ask for a water refills, but my server was very sassy in a TV sitcom sort of way. She tried to make little quirky jokes every time she came to the table, but they just came off like she was mad at the world and we were the cause of it. Like I said very TV sitcom-ish.   The decor here needs to be updated desperately. It has a cafeteria look; very open and very cold, but with a country grandma style. By this I mean there's random farm and rooster decor on the walls. Which makes me laugh because roosters don't lay eggs. It's Science!   The food is tasty, but basic. I was here with four other people and I tried everyone's dish... I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad; the salad for the guy who never orders salad. This was great in my opinion, big chunks of chicken coated in buffalo sauce on huge bed of fresh greens w/ eggs and tomatoes. My foodie friends ordered the \"Veggie Benny\", \"The Cobb\", and the \"Pesto Scramble\".   The \"Veggie Benny\" was the star in this line-up. This plate comes with spinach, avocado, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but lite in an interesting way, and the hash browns were golden brown and crispy. I would most likely order this if I came back to the Cracked Egg. The other dishes were forgetful and don't need to be mentioned in this review.   This place needs a design overhaul and few updates on the menu. These simple changes could really elevate this place...Where's Robert Irvine?!?  Pro Tip: The baked goods in this place are steller. Try the Blueberry Muffin/Coffee Cake",

    "text": "I've had breakfast at The Cracked Egg on multiple occasions and nothing in that restaurant warrants the, at times, outrageous wait. On my latest visit I had The Garden Patch Omelet which had broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese. The omelet was around $10 and came out very dry, almost inedible if it wasn't for the pounds of melted cheese on top. The veggies on the inside were mushy and indistinguishable. The side of hash browns was okay, as was the toast... but a hefty price to pay for some toast and small side of hash browns. I picked at my omelet, and left over half of it un eaten. My previous visits here were equally unmemorable, but I got to catch up with lovely Jaime W here, so I opted to give this place another shot. I think this will be my last visit to The Cracked Egg though.",

From entering to leaving, the staff were really nice.  Our server was pretty good.  Even though you could tell she was pretty busy, she managed to be really nice and attentive.  I love me some good customer service and she did a really good job.  The host/hostess were cool.  They clowned my GF for accidentally running into this baby, knocking her down, and making her cry.  For the food, the coffee cake was really good.  Careful though, I think they throw it in the microwave to heat it up a bit, so the filling gets a little hot.  Really good though.  My corned beef hash was OK.  Not bad, but not that exciting either.  GF ordered some kind of enchilada omelette that wasn't very good.  It wasn't gross, but it just lacked flavor all around.  It just tasted like egg and cheese, basically.  The potatoes were addicting, though.  Overall, I think I'd give it another shot and order something different.  *No babies were harmed during this visit*",

We always come late Sunday morning, knowing there will be a Sunday wait and we are prepared.  We check in and then visit Popcorn Girl for a sample or two and walk through the pet store to see the latest gadgets (or just look at the same pet toys from the week before ...).  When we run out of things to do, we go back and wait for our name to be called while checking our Facebook or playing on our phones.  The time goes by quickly and we are seated in no time at all.  Our kids love the kids menus with crayons.  Since they already have their regular meals, they get to coloring while we choose between the sinfully delicious choices and the more sensible and healthy options.    BTW, when you are offered the choice of toast or coffee cake, try the coffee cake just once - YUM!  But don't think we are just Sunday visitors, we also come to this place for the occasional weekday breakfast or lunch.  We also often meet friends here for a much livelier meal.  This is Las Vegas' version of the local Sunday Brunch spot. Thank you Cracked Egg!",

The glaring failure with this place is their absolute inability to correctly put together a to go order.  I say inability, because there can't be any other explanation for their 100% failure rate. I can only assume that there is some kind of medical condition plaguing the staff that prohibits them from grasping the concept of checking an order before they hand it off.   I work in an office across from this place, and I have literally had this problem dozens of times. Every time I think, \"Ya know self, it's been awhile, maybe they have some new people in there now, maybe this time will be the time they don't suck\". Nope.

When we needed refills it took a bit, had to wave at the server to get attention a few times. Takes a while for the food, but once you get it you forget about the service. Yum!  I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with hash browns and I was in heaven. People I was with got the Greek omelette and the Nutella filled french toast, both were pretty good, according to them.   I would definitely go back here, but because they are only open for breakfast/brunch there can be quite a rush. Next time I'll be sure to go earlier, maybe service will be better if the crowd is a little smaller.",

    "text": "This is my second time at the Cracked Egg (Henderson Location) and the first time all I could remember was the fact that the food was delicious; hence my desire to make a return trip.  Walking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait would be 5 minutes; no problem. When my name was shouted (as if there was a fire mind you), the \"hostess\" snatched the silverware and menus and raced off to the table.  She did not so much as look back to see if we were following her, nor did she even say anything to us as we were seating ourselves. Why? Oh yeah, that's because she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.  This atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server; who's service was also sub par.  Thankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy.   I thoroughly enjoy the eats at the Cracked egg however we will not be returning to this location again.",

Cracked egg has an interesting variety of egg options and fantastic pancakes. On top of the Joey Scramble I just had to try the Oreo pancake special. It's loaded with Oreos!!!!!  Of course there was no way I could finish all of this so I took it home and it tasted just as good the next morning!  Can't beat the cracked egg with their specials, skillets, and salads!   Service is always just fine, food is prepared quickly and it's always clean.",

Homemade Corned Beef Hash-Had to add salt.  I asked for a side of rice, but sadly, they don't make rice there.  C'mon, I am Asian.  I love rice with Corned Beef.  But that is not the reason why I gave them only 3 stars.  I asked the waitress to have my egg scrambled over easy, it came out non-scrambled, over easy. Under-seasoned.  We chose the seasoned potatoes, the hash brown, and the coffee cake to go with our food.  The coffee cake was warm and moist, with cherries at the bottom.  Tasted delicious with the coffee.  For the hash brown, I asked for it extra crispy, but didn't come out to how I would like it to be.    If I come back, I will probably just order the coffee cake and a cup of coffee.",

I ordered the Californian Omelette that had bacon, avocado and jack cheese... so good. Be sure to order the seasoned potatoes! They put this cajun seasoning on top that's making my mouth water right now.. My friend got the Cracked Croissant and that looked even better my omelette, definitely have to order it next time.   Zappos employees really hyped up the coffee cake but I found it too sweet to enjoy for breakfast, I'll probably go for the toast or other choice next time.   Great for breakfast and brunch, I'll for sure be back to try more!",

    "text": "A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend. This location in particular was our second stop at a Cracked Egg location.  There was a bit of a wait at this location on a Sunday, but they still moved the line pretty quickly. This location also has a great outdoor patio dining area which unfortunately was full. We waited for no longer than 10 minutes and service was super-fast and friendly! Tip: If there is a long wait, you can sit at the counter and not wait at all. Another plus about this location: our meals came out really quickly! So quickly that even our waitress said it was quick! Given that we were famished, we definitely appreciated that.  Having been through the drill at their other location, I requested the gluten free menu and was excited to try yet another meal here. SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes.   At this location I tried the Lighten Up scramble which consisted of egg whites, with turkey, diced green peppers and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was delicious - the ingredients tasted really fresh and light. I ordered the hash browns again because they are so darn good - perfectly seasoned and crispy!   My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs!   Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches.",

We had no wait time, it was about 11:30 A.m. only one couple In of us, we were seated right away. Based on the reviews we chose the coffee cake for our choice between toast and coffee cake. It was hot and delicious & had apple inside. Coffee went well with the coffee cake. We both had eggs and ham. Overall breakfast was delicious, and the price was fair. Will definitely go, if we are in this area again at eating time. Will recommend to friends and family.",

The place was packed with what looked like regulars, and we had a 20+ minute wait.   We were shown to a table and service was decent. Within a couple minutes we had our drinks and placed our orders. I got the Country Bennie, which is like eggs Benedict with country gravy. She got the Cracked Croissant, which is a croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and such. Both came with better than average hash browns.  Both were very good. The portions are fair, and should fill you up. I had to bring some food to someone at home, so I ordered up a couple Monte Cristo's. They were good, but not as good as other places. That being said, Monte Cristo's are hard to find, and I'm glad they have them.  The coffee cake looks amazingly good, although I did not have any.  One tip: The price is fair, but I did notice we seem to be the only one paying without a coupon. They do seem to also be in the coupon mailer, so if you haven't tossed it out yet, and you're thinking about going to The Cracked Egg, you should look for the coupon.",

Whether sitting at the counter (no waiting) or in the main dining area (usually a wait), I have consistently experienced good service at the Cracked Egg.  At times it's a little slow, but they get very busy during weekend brunch, so it's hard to find fault with that.  You'll find typical American breakfast and lunch fare here.  Not much that would pique your interest to venture off the beaten path; but sometimes you're just looking for familiar comfort food.  Their omlettes, scrambles, and bennies are all tasty and hearty.  Their burgers are juicy and flavorful, and their salads fresh and cruchy.  Their pancakes are good too, but they're no Dupar's or Babystacks.  The space itself is large and clean, but could really use a decorator's touch.  Side benefit of The Cracked Egg is it's proximity to Popcorn Girl :).",

The servers come by as soon as you are seated to take orders if you are ready, but they don't rush you if you aren't ready. The food comes out pretty quickly after ordering.   The menu is huge with a nice variety of breakfast options. As the name implies most of the options are geared toward eggs, but they also offer pancakes and waffles. The omelets are made with three eggs so they are huge. Skillets are also filling options. The coffee cake that comes with many of the meals is moist and sweet. I'd suggest adding a side of coffee cake if your meal doesn't already come with it. I love that there are many options with a Mexican twist including chorizo options.",

After we had finished our food and before our plates were cleared, our server brought a nearby table their food, then got in a conversation with another table and his back was to us. He talked so long that the first table FINISHED their meal and he was still talking, ignoring everyone else. All we wanted was our check. Finally a third table asked if he could please check on their food and he was not pleased at being interrupted. He informed her that he has other tables, not just her, and stormed off to the kitchen. Rude. And to top it all off, 30 minutes after leaving both my husband and myself (we ordered different foods and different drinks) were extremely ill. Gut wrenching horribleness.

They just started helping everyone that had cash while a lime started building for people with credit cards.   Once it was fixed, they helped every person in line except me.

I was seriously going to leave without paying because the service was so terrible I didn't want to give them a dime, but I couldn't because they were holding my card. I'm not even upset that the machine broke and the wait was long to pay, I'm just really pissed about how this was handled and how no one apologized or gave two shits about the customers. Not to mention the hostess screwed up the transaction of the guy before me and put someone else's bill on his card that was much hire than what it was supposed to be.   I hate to be a jerk and write a bad review for this place because the food is great but this specific situation handled poorly.",

    "text": "I have visited The Cracked Egg several times and have waited a while to write a review.  This is mostly because this place is \"meh\" enough that I couldn't figure out what I thought about it.  Service is pretty poor.  One morning we brought my father here while he was in town for a visit.  We had to wait ten minutes for someone to even offer us a drink.  If Dad wasn't so hungry from his long plane ride, we would have left.  Even when we were finally served, the service left something to be desired.  My dish was cold and under-seasoned.    Some time later, I decided to give The Cracked Egg another try.  There are enough positive Yelp reviews that I thought maybe I just had an anomalous bad experience.  But the second time, it was even worse.  I asked to substitute egg whites in my skillet...when it came out with normal eggs and I asked to have it made correctly (very nicely, I might add), I received an audible groan in response.  The waitress acted as though it was a huge inconvenience for her to walk back to the kitchen.  The extra star is for the coffee cake, which my dad loved.  Other than that, I don't really see why I would visit The Cracked Egg when there are much better breakfast joints in town.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "Management soured my experience.  Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles.",

The omelet itself was stuffed full of meat but was small by all standards (took up less than half my plate and was half an inch thick).  Coffee cake was absolutely delicious so I am glad I read the reviews and knew to order it. Four dollars for orange juice was pretty steep when the entree itself cost ten dollars. Lesson learned though.   Overall 10$ for a small omelet and 4$ for orange juice leaves me wanting a lot more for the price.  I would go back for the coffee cake but that's really the only thing pulling me back.",

There's trash on the floor and I watched the staff walk by it multiple times including the busser and no one seemed to care to pick it up. Additionally, our server seemed disinterested. She was not very genuine with her service. Made it a horrible experience especially when we are paying good money to buy cheap food. Pretty sure their food cost for French Toast is like 1 dollar and they charged it up to about 10 dollars. I gave it a two star because the food was OK.",

My plan was not to eat too much because I knew I had to save room to stuff my face at the M buffet later that evening. After reading all the reviews about the big portions, I split the croissant sandwich and seasoned potatoes with my mom. It was definitely a knife and fork sandwich especially because I ordered the eggs over easy. There's a reason why you can't get an over easy egg mcmuffin. It was a delicious, cheesy mess.  I particularly loved the seasoned potatoes, which were super crispy. I can just imagine eating a whole plate of them with gravy! The bf also raved about the hash browns, but I think the seasoned potatoes were better. I also had a bite of my dad's coffee cake which was a bit too sweet for me. It looked like a cornbread square and was less dense than the coffee cakes I'm used to.  Overall, definitely a good place for breakfast or lunch. I mean, even in Vegas you can only eat so many buffets afterall...",

Starved and fatigue since the night before, this sweet beginning couldn't have come at a better time.    I knew I wanted some scrambled eggs but my rational mind opted for an omelette with vegetables, the Garden Patch.  It was a wrong choice as I was eyeing my friend's scrambled eggs the whole time.  Luckily I got to steal some and heavenly fluffy it was.  Don't get me wrong.  The Garden Patch omelette would have been a great hit if I were a rabbit.  Note to self - never put broccoli in an omelette.  Go for the hashbrown if you can.  If you get lucky, they'll brown it thoroughly and what you get will be a crunchy shreddy and starchy texture to play with in your mouth.  Definitely one of the funnest moments in my mouth.",

I usually order the eggs Benedict and their hollandaise sauce is the best I've ever had. I'm a connoisseur and they are willing to customize my order to meet my dietary needs. I really appreciate that, all of the servers here give exceptional service. Last week while dining for breakfast I asked the waiter about the coffee, it's soooo good and he said it was from a free trade organic source.  I would like to give Sunrise Cafe five stars and I will when they're the first place in town to offer organic eggs and potatoes for breakfast. Organic is important to me for many reasons and I would be willing to pay a premium to have those options!!! Overall - love this place.",

It was a little too lite and very crumbly to the point I was wondering if it was undercooked but it had a nice taste although a tad sweet.  Service was eggcelent.

This is my first time here-- it's family oriented that's good for groups too. Our waiter got our drinks right away. I got cranberry mixed with orange juice and south shore scramble. It was a good mix of heart healthy and indulging. South shore was scrambled with eggs, cheese, bacon, and avocado on top with a side of seasoned potatoes. It was good and the portion was just right. I also got coffee as a side. I was so full from the scramble that I barely touched it. I still liked the texture and it's sweetness. It wasn't overwhelming.",

I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash which came with bell peppers, onions and 2 eggs, hash browns, and a toast. My friend ordered South Shore Scramble which came with 3 eggs scrambled with diced chicken, bacon, sliced avocado and swiss, a piece of coffee cake, and fruits. We ended up switching our main dishes ourselves because we like each other's better. I love the scrambled egg and the avocado the most. What is interesting is that the famous coffee cake in this restaurant isn't really a coffee cake as it doesn't have coffee flavor. So we asked the waiter to see if he accidentally served us a chocolate pound cake and he replied, \"it's only called a coffee cake,\" which cracked me up. Overall, I like the combination of their food.",

At The Cracked Egg not only do they offer great breakfast options can order lunch at the same time. I have been too another one of their property on my side of town. Always had great experience from the food, service, and one of my favorite go too breakfast restaurants.   I ordered \"The Enchilada\" omelette. Instead of toast ALWAYS go for the coffee cake. The coffee cake no matter which one they offer (on this day think was cherry) not only is it fresh, steamy hot, moist, and nice BiG size piece. Awesome that you can substitute your toast for coffee cake! The seasoned potatoes so addicting really could go carb crazy have whole plate of it. I love the seasoning not sure what it is except perfect blend, just want too keep eating them, and perfect compliment with anything eggs or in my case omelette. The Enchilada lot of stuff going on inside the omelette. The enchilada sauce felt like that made all the ingredients come together in perfect harmony. Top off the omelette with the cheese. One of the better omelette ever had for breakfast. The portion size does not end with the coffee cake. Between the omelette and the generous amount of seasoned potato hearty and leave stuffed.   The restaurant is much bigger in size then the one that closer on my side of town. It had more open air feeling too it cause of the size. The interior has the same vibe as the other location. Truly most important is the food is consistent with other location. Great breakfast/lunch spot!!!!! Our server was awesome the whole time staying on top of everything from our drinks and making sure everything going well.   Not often in Henderson but no doubt if in the area need too get my breakfast fix in The Cracked Egg is the spot. I looked forward too the next visit!",

My wife loves the Benedict.  The first thing I noticed was the terrible parking lot. There are way too many businesses in the shopping center for the size of the parking lot.  Parking aside, I heard great things about this place, so I was looking forward to breakfast. Also, the place was packed, so I assumed the food would be good. It was. The portions were big, and the service was good.  Their breakfast was a little better than IHOP, but priced twice as much. A breakfast for two was $28. A couple of basic omelets, potatoes and drinks for $28? How in the world does this place justify these ridiculous prices?   Advice to management: You blew it on the location with the parking lot, but there's nothing you can do about it now. Cut the price and cut the portions. No one wants to take an omelet home for leftovers.  Fix the value, and I'll give it 4*, because the food was as expected and the staff was pleasant.",

Love breakfast joints like this but sad to say that on my first experience here was not a joyous one, do to the lack of enthusiasm from customer service and the food at best ! Was mediocre .. I was stoked to try this place because of the reviews it has received and the pics of the food looked delish  .. Maybe just an off day ..",

The cake is different every time, but always very delicious!    They get very busy during lunch hours and especially breakfast times during the weekend, so plan accordingly.  They have wonderful service and some of the staff even remembers me and I'm not even a regular.  You feel at home here and I'm always stuffed after going.    Enjoy!! :)",

This time, I would like to say that I was very happy and full (for the entire day) with my meal.   I got a scramble... Lucie's Scramble! Made with 3 eggs (yikes!) sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms.... with 2 slices of giant muenster cheese melted on top! Not a single ingredient was lacking, and the portions are nothing short of plentiful. Yum   I wanted to change up my order and avoid the coffee cake and seasoned potatoes (which are good, but distract me from my main meal). Went with the hash browns and toast, and I think I will followup on my decision next time. Yes... there will be a next time, regardless of the spotty service.   As noted in previous reviews... service is a little on the off side, but not BAD. The food is totally worth it. Can't wait for my next breakfast outing.",

Do not go here if you are in a hurry.  If service and delivery time were faster, I would give it 5 stars.  With all the business they have, and on weekends the long wait time for a table, you would think that they are raking in the money and could afford more waitresses and more cooks.

    "text": "Brunch used to be one of my fav. meals EVER. But, since moving here, we've noticed that LV is not as much of a brunch town as some of its Northeastern, Midatlantic and Midwestern neighbors (We miss you Chi... SNIFF). So, when one of my girls suggested the Cracked Egg for brunch recently, I couldn't say \"I'm in\" fast enough.   I knew that there were others, like me, who missed brunch when I saw a line the size of India outside this resto. But, when I had my first bite of the GVR (the avocado, muenster, egg white combo is stellar!), I realized that people line up not JUST because they miss brunch BUT ALSO because the food here is delish!   Whatever your reason for coming to the Cracked Egg, you will be in for a treat. Service is great. The food is tasty. And, for a reasonable price (it came to about $100 incl. a 20% tip for 8 of us), you will have a great brunch.   A word to the wise: these folks will accommodate your meal to suit your request so don't be shy to ask. Also, if you order toast and don't want it to arrive pre-buttered, make sure to preference \"Dry\" toast. The same is True for \"Light\" cheese, egg whites (in place of eggs), and subbing the potatoes (the seasoned potatoes are awesome!) for fruit or cottage cheese.",

    "text": "Breakfast is my least favorite meal by far and I'll only go out for a weekend breakfast meal about 5 times a year. But when I do go, The Cracked Egg is one of the places I'll go to. Whenever I try to go on a Sunday the lines are out of the door so I recommend Saturdays. The restaurant has two separate dining rooms so there's plenty of seating, especially if you don't have many people in your party.  Their menu has a ton of variety. With most of the breakfasts you'll have a choice of toast or coffee cake and potatoes or hash browns. These are essentials for any solid breakfast spot. On this last trip my boyfriend and I shared the macadamia coconut pancakes and the green scramble. The pancakes are so good they've inspired me to try to recreate them at home. There's plenty of coconut shreds in each bite with the occasional crunch of macadamia nut. The dish comes with three huge pancakes and we were each only able to finish one. The green scramble was also delicious, filled with broccoli, chiles, spinach and chicken. The star of this show was for sure the green salsa. I could drink this salsa it was so fresh and yummy. I would order any dish on the menu that has this (they seem to offer a lot of Mexican inspired breakfasts).   The Cracked Egg is the perfect every-so-often stuff your face full of breakfast food and lay on the couch of the rest of the day. I can't do it very often but when I'm ready for it again and craving those coconut macadamia pancakes I will pretty much always choose to come here.",

In part, I didn't discover until my second cup. The \"creamers\" on the table are actually \"non-dairy\" in disguise!  So, if you want real milk or cream -you have to ask for it (which they don't tell you!!)  What upset me the most was my waffle. It was a good waffle and their syrup decent - however, for $7 for just a small round waffle (no, no extras just the waffle).  You would think the large cup of what looked like whipped butter would be perfect.  Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. It was a large cup of whipped ... fake something. I'm thinking canola oil but not sure - I am 100% sure it was not in any way butter!  When I nicely mentioned it at check out after spending $25 on breakfast - I got two smirks with a promise they'd pass it on.  So, I'm not the only one that's commented on it. New management needed before you go bust.  So many other places to go for breakfast for a fraction of the price.",

Well this past Sunday was absolutely horrific, my polite husband orders our food like usually and ask the we believe it was the manager what coffee cake they have for today.., as you know on there website it says they have different coffee cake for the day! She replies and I say on quote \" I don't know I'm in the office\" then continues to say \" I don't want to commit to telling you something I'm unsure of\" oh wow really so let me get this straight you can't walk -X- amount of feet to find out what flavor of coffee cake you have???! For the Day!!!!! Actually isn't it your job to know!! I  have officially became that person that I heard the attitude she spewed from her mouth! Really I understand your busy and frustrated but you can't treat people with respect?? I had called back to cancel our order I specifically tell this so called manager that I can order else where, she says so you want to cancel the order I said yes!! My husband doesn't need this especially on Father's Day, I will continue my service to a place that appreciates guest, doesn't decline and give attitude for strictly asking questions in regards to there menu!!!!!!!",

Their food is reasonably priced and the portions are always more than you can eat, be prepared to take home a to-go container.

I chose to get it with a side of seasoned potatoes (which were just like the fries so I was SO happy) and a side of coffee cake.   I love that you can choose between a side of toast or coffee cake - most places you are charged extra if you want another side and most times I don't even want toast so I'm glad that this was an option. The coffee cake was perfectly warm, soft, and fluffy. I love it.   Whenever I get the chance I will come back here and try the other items on their menu. Service is great!",

    "text": "The Cracked Egg is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Henderson.  This place gets busy! But the service here is always spot on.   COME HUNGRY!  There is no such thing as a \"light breakfast\" here.  Most entrees come with a side (seasoned potatoes or hash browns) and either coffee cake or toast.  The seasoned potatoes are delicious, nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning!  And always get the coffee cake!  They bring out the cake first and it's just the right amount of sweet to get you salivating for your meal.  It also pairs great with coffee.   Since I'm not huge on breakfast or heavy meals, I always get one of their vegetarian dishes.  Like I said, their portions are huge!  But with the vegetarian options, I'm able to finish up the plate with a few potatoes left over.   Veggie Benny - sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.   The GVP scramble - comes with mushrooms, spinach, avocado & muenster cheese topped with sour cream.    I also love the feel of the restaurant. definitely has the old school vibe.  Also look around and read the signs! There's one that says something about putting down your phones & talk to each other like its 19?? (some year before cell phones).",

So we got a little Jesus in them and great food! Lol! Servers are all warm, attentive people. The employees hustle working their tails off to please you! I love the monthly $8.00 off breakfast coupons they mail out. My husband and I share an omelette, have the kitchen split it fit us for a small charge but we always wind up tummies full and happy. I always get a \"to go\" cup for my morning iced tea before we leave. Love, love, love this place! Our kids are grown up and out, but always find time to have breakfast/lunch there with us!",

The bus boy was also incredibly nice and so attentive.  The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because our server seemed bothered  every time we asked for something. When we asked for more ketchup she snatched it from us without saying anything and then came back and slammed it on the table. She was also clearly annoyed when we asked her to split the check 2 ways.  Great food, but the server could have been friendlier.",

The service was excellent as the waitress was very nice and the food came out super quick.

    "text": "I'm starting to branch out and embrace the \"art\" of eating breakfast...lol.  Like many Americans, I find myself skipping the most important meal of the day, however, once in a while, breakfast is valid.  Today was one of those days.  My boss and I decided to have our meeting at The Cracked Egg, for a change of scenery.  AMBIANCE: The place is alright.  The decor is a little drab and boring.  There are booths and table tops, as well as a bar top to choose from.  I think it's kind of a lame attempt at a diner/breakfast nook-ish ambiance.  Hard to pin point, because nothing really comes together for me.  I do know, however, that it's very busy.  A lot of people seem to enjoy this place.  I'm guessing it's because of the food. LOL.  FOOD and SERVICE:  Today, I got the Eggs Benedict for $9.95.  The bread was kinda of soggy.  Although this entree is smothered with hollandaise, I've had a lot of benedicts to know the potential of the bottom bread.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly, the canadian bacon was thicker than what I'm used to, which is good.  The hollandaise was thicker than what I prefer.  My entree came with hash browns which was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The way it should be!  YUM!  All in all, my breakfast was a hit.  Here's where The Cracked Egg falls short for me.  Whenever I come into this restaurant, I always end up driving separately and meeting my party there.  If I'm the first person there, I'll get a table.  Although my entire party has not arrived yet, the server DOES NOT greet our table until all members of the party arrive.  This was the third occurence that I've noticed.  I think as courtesy, they should at least greet any member of the party, no matter what percentage is present.  I will say that they have employees taking beverage orders in the beginning which I appreciate.  Two instances though, including today, I needed to order right away so I could leave early and make a meeting at work.  That's where I see the benefit of the actual server coming by to greet whoever is there.  Please don't let my rant determine your decision to visit this place.  The food is actually good.  I appreciate the fact that they have healthy options like Garden Patch omelette, the lowfat scrambble, Lighten Up scrambble and an option to have fruit as your side instead of starch options.  Their menu is filled with lots of a great choices.  Please go in and try their coffee cakes.  They are to die for!",

    "text": "So I give The Cracked Egg this rating on behalf of my husband. The reason being...     When my husband and I go to Las Vegas, we try to find food eating \"gems\" that are NOT on the strip. Last time we were there, my husband had wanted a Monte Cristo, and I read that they served one at the Luxor's Pyramid Cafe. We went and he found out it was actually a \"Monte Carlo\", not a \"Monte Cristo\".... (sadness on the part of my husband)...     This time, I did some research and found that there was a small chain called The Cracked Egg. We went to the one in Henderson and.... Bruce was in HEAVEN...  It was a REAL Monte Cristo The turkey, ham and swiss cheese dipped in a french toast batter and deep fried, (unlike the Monte Carlo, which is just grilled). I ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast, and was very satisfied. Very tasty and real fresh raspberries all over it too.     Not only were the portions huge... (we couldn't finish either order), but it was all perfectly cooked to our liking. I noticed other orders around us, and they also seemed like very generous helpings. The waiter, was very fast, efficient, but still very cordial.  I liked the fact that is is not just a breakfast house, which includes a \"gluten free\" menu,  but they have an extensive menu of sandwiches, burgers and salads.      Needless to say, when we visit Las Vegas again, we will definitely go to the Cracked Egg for our breakfast. Maybe try the other ones a bit closer to the middle of town.",

All have been a pleasant experience with exception to the last time a came to this location.  Upon entering the restaurant on a Sunday (My bad, but we were hungry) we were met not greeted by a frownie faced hostessed that addressed us like a herd of cattle.  No put on edge, I awaited to see what was going to happen next.  after a relatively short wait, we were taken to a table where all the scraps from the previous diners and been swept on to the bench I was about to sit on.  I waited to have it cleaned before I sat down.  We sat down to await our server and after several minutes I pulled out my phone and activated the stopwatch feature to see just how long this was going take.  Four minutes before someone other than our server got the drink orders.  When the drinks arrived they were followed by a shower of straws thrown down by the angry lady.  My Yelp senses start kicking in and I remained calm and went into surveillance mode.  The first thing I noticed was that not many employees seemed to be smiling.  The Sunday rush must really have taken it to them.  When we finally ordered from our waiter he was somewhat relaxed but had an edge to him that made me twitchy on a Sunday morning.  I ordered up Greek Scramble  and found to be much as it is at the other establishments....pretty good.  The negative energy in the air and curt demeanor in addition to my cup running empty with a refill not to be found caused my stomach to sour.  This is my last run on this restaurant even though Gary Oldman has supposedly dined there.  I have several crates of Costco eggs that I can make magic with at home.  I will prepare them many ways but with only one smile.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been enjoying breakfast at The Cracked Egg for a long time! We had one close to our old place and now we are less than 5 minutes away from this one. This is not my favorite location, but the food is definitely good.   As everyone has already pointed out, the coffee cake is fantastic. It is not exactly what you think of when people say coffee cake, it is more like a white cake with some fruit filling on the bottom and some delicious frosting on top. My only gripe is that I wish they told you what kind of coffee cake they had that day and that there was just a little more fruit filling.  We usually end up getting a skillet, but they also have delicious pancakes! I am in love with the Kicking Potatoes, seasoned potatoes, bits of bacon, and melted cheddar cheese, served with a side of salsa and sour cream. I also like the option to make your own skillet and if you are in the mood for veggies, the vegetarian skillet is a fantastic option. Most of the skillets also come with coffee cake, win!  Now, I am usually very satisfied with the food, but have received spotty service from this location. Nobody seems too happy to be working here, from the hostess, to the waitstaff, to the manager. I have even seen the manager take on a customer who had a food allergy and was very specific about his order, which they messed up. I don't think it is ever OK to argue with a customer, especially in this situation where it could have gotten really severe if the customer had a life or death allergy. There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the loud exchange was certainly avoidable, I think a sincere apology would have gone a long way. I was also present when they messed up a rather large take-out order for some of my fellow team mates at work and didn't do much to rectify the situation.   I also really dislike the fact that you have to take your check up to the cash register. That area can get very congested in the morning since it is also the hostess station. If you manage to fight the crowd and make it to the register, I find it quite uncomfortable that they ask you how much tip you would like to leave. I don't understand why they can't just let you fill out the receipt like every other business. Overall, the food is good, but don't prepare to be WOWed by the service.",

    "text": "Worst service I've ever received. They simply care more about themselves than pleasing the customer.  We came to meet my mom and surprise her, we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom's table pulled next to her table and my mom's server refused, \"because it wasn't her section.\" Uh ok, whatever! So my husband and I just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes. I say to my husband, I think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here. So I did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server.  The hostess was more than put out but I ignored it. Our server grudgingly showed up, took our order and disappeared, never to be heard from again until our food showed. I had two eggs over medium, they were fine except my food was served on a  warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time I ate off of it. My husband ordered basic eggs Benedict. The eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot. So nasty. He pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that's how eggs Benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not True. The manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the EB from our bill with out hassle. It took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did, it appeared that the EB had not been removed. I asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves. Well needless to say at this point, I'm offended beyond reason and I begin to lose it with the hostess. The manager comes again and is very nice again, but he clearly has no control over his staff. I NOR MY HUSBAND WILL EVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! The food is not worth the hassle and it's very over priced. I ended up paying $18 for two eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon,  and coffee. And as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude, unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor. Stay away. I had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences, which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience.",

    "text": "As others noted, I too noticed a considerable lack of good, creative brunch spots in Vegas.  Most places are the same ol', same ol'.  Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns.  The Cracked Egg doesn't deviate too much from this standard. It mostly offers typical breakfast fare - an assortment of omelets, pancakes, scrambles, etc.  If you're in the mood for something relatively unique they do have plenty of options for interesting omelet combinations, a delicious benedict ole (heart attack on a plate), and their \"coffee cakes\" - a standard side with many of the menu items - are divine (and flavors vary daily, it's not your typical coffee cake, they must use smooth as silk cake flower and maybe add in sour cream or something to give it creaminess and tang).  My favorite standard is the huevos rancheros.  A simple tasty sauce covers refried beans, eggs how you like them, sitting on a flour tortilla and topped with melted cheese and jalapenos.  It's simple, but they do it well.  Not too much cheese (I really don't need to eat 12 oz of cheese in a given meal like some places believe), medium spicy peppers, and plenty of beans, just how I like it!  It's not the most unique food you can find (although it's as unique as any I've found in this city) nor is it on the top of the healthy list, but it's satisfying and consistent, reasonably priced, and has become my weekend go-to place!",

However, the food is overpriced, portions are not huge, and service is usually bad.  Count on spending $12-15 per person for a meal, tax, and tip; add a few more bucks if you're getting a beverage.  Coworkers who suggested this place to me said I could have a full meal for $6; based on menu prices, I assume my coworkers consider toast and coffee a full meal.  The restaurant is very loud and cramped.  Your wooden chairs will get bumped into by anyone trying to pass and the screeching of wood on tiles will give you a headache.  There isn't much of a waiting area and given this place's popularity, you'll probably have to wait.  My chicken chile verde omelet was good, seasoned potatoes very tasty, and our various sandwiches good but nothing special.  The coffee cake was awful.  It was like stale angel cake purchased from a gas station, sprinkled with cinnamon, and stuffed with canned apple pie filling.  Good service usually changes my opinion of a restaurant, but this was downright bad.  Our waiter was curt, only gave us one coffee refill (after flagging him down), and tossed our check on the table before we'd finished eating.  The restaurant was significantly less crowded than when we arrived so I'm not sure why he was in such a hurry to get rid of us.  We're nice people who have worked in restaurants and sympathize with overbusy waitstaff.  I only go here when I'm with pretentious friends who insist on eating at local mom & pop shops instead of IHOP or Denny's.  Eat here if you must and enjoy your smug satisfaction; I'll be over at IHOP feasting on better food for less money.",

Not noisy at all. Service was great. Asked for a drink when I sat down and my Pepsi never got empty. The staff was very friendly. I am glad my friend recommeded this place for lunch. Not sure if they have wifi.",

But cracked egg always keep me full with their amazing eggs omelet. Downsides are it is pretty pricey and that it is always always busy around lunch time, and I will always have to wait for a table for party more than 4 people.",

As some other reviewers have pointed out, the food is priced fairly high, even for simple dishes. However, what really takes this down for me is the service. In the time we have been coming here, only one server - Indra - really qualifies as friendly. Today, our server was downright lousy. He was very inefficient - the restaurant wasn't busy, and he seemed to have no sense of order in terms of how he took care of his tables. Honestly, if the service was just a bit better, I would probably come here more often.",

Food arrives in a timely manner.  Overall, everything I've ordered has been tasty. Large portions. The spicier dishes (eg. anything with chorizo and or green chile) are too mild for my tastes, but like that there is the option to have something with some non-Anglo flair. The coffee cake I had as my \"toast\" option on this past visit was a bit of a disappointment: taste and consistency of something that came out of a Betty Crocker box.  Nice breakfast place.

The wait was about five minutes and the server was quick and efficient with our drinks and taking our orders. Once our food arrived; however, he was nowhere to be found. My friend Lisa L had the pancakes and I had the tropical french toast... I know the description said coconut but this thing was COVERED in shredded coconut. Like the whole surface was pretty much shredded coconut. The flavor was great and the texture was nice but I literally filled up on shredded coconut. We spent about 20 minutes sitting around waiting for our server to come back so we could get our bill and though he walked by like four times, he didn't so much as glance in our direction. By this time, the crowd had really thinned out too so it's not like it was crazy busy. The food was good enough to warrant three stars but the service left us frustrated. It would be one thing if the server was so busy he couldn't make it through the room but we saw him pass so many times and it took forever to flag him down.",

They really have some amazing stuff on the menu. It is worth checking out the menu before you go so you are prepared. I'm a simple guy so i usually get coffee, the cakes & eggs combo which is basically 2 large pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 slices bacon.   I've tried a few varieties of things other people with me have ordered like stuffed french toast of peanut butter, nutella. I've tried the eggs benedict, coffee cakes, biscuits in gravy, chocolate chip pancakes, etc. Really it is all very good!   The place is very busy on the weekends. I got to go orders in like 15 minutues but sometimes if you go on a Sat/Sun morning you could have up to an hour wait to get seated and it is not a small restaurant. Thats a good sign!   I think the only drawback is sometimes when I crave in the evening/night, they are closed. I think the hours are 6am-3pm which works for breakfast/lunch meals.",

Something for everyone. Prices seemed to range between $9 and $14. Little pricey for breakfast.   The hash browns seemed soaked in grease and weren't very hot (reheated maybe?). The bacon was extra chewy, leading me to believe it was cooked much earlier in the day and ''stored'' until needed.   It's drab and dark inside of the restaurant, and the employees seemed not to care much. Could have been cleaner in my opinion.   Sorry but I'll take EggWorks ANY day.",

I did like how the eggs were runny under all if the cheese and meat.  Service was excellent.  Seem to have an extensive menu, but did not see chiliquiles on the menu, which is one of my favorites.",

I'm not sure what this place is known for. Breakfast burritos? Pancakes? I had the Greek omelette which was awful. The eggs were overlooked. The best part was the toast. Hash brown were greasy and tasted like oil.",

I mean it was super delicious. 3 pieces of bread, loads of avocado. It was just delicious. I would never have thought a sandwich would be better than an omelet at a place called \"the cracked egg\"!

I never did see them do anything the full time we were there. We finally \"caught\" the waitress who was zipping by. She said the kitchen was \"backed up\"! The place was less than 1/2 full. Goodbye!

It was excellent) Oatmeal (It was the largest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen.  It came with a bowl of beautiful fresh berries.  My friend loved it) Chicken and gravy as well as biscuits and gravy (It looked great.  He said it tasted great) Bacon and eggs (He said the eggs were cooked perfectly) Carnitas Omelette (This was my dish on day 2 because I wanted to try something different.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because the omelette had way too many onions.  They were tasty, but just too many).  If I'm in the neighborhood the next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going to The Cracked Egg.",

    "text": "Decided to check out their Eggs Benedict this morning. Dreena was our server this morning, and she was great. She was attentive and very professional.   We always split a breakfast and get a side of some kind. So we ordered the Benedict, replacing the Canadian Bacon with regular bacon, and then decided on a coffee cake. We ordered coffee, and I like that there was regular cream as well as vanilla creamer already at the table. The coffee was really good. Nice and hot, and had good flavor.   Our coffee cake came out very quickly, and after about three bites of that our breakfast arrived. The coffee cake was very crumbly, but really flavorful. Nice vanilla flavor with a hint of lemon in the icing. The eggs Benedict was not a huge portion, actually rather small. Definitely not worthy of sharing like we typically do. Good to know, so next time we will actually get separate breakfasts. I like their use of green chiles throughout the menu, so we will be checking those out at some point.   We arrived at 9:30 Sunday, and the place was jamming. It was loud, but not bad. We felt rushed, even though our server made sure to tell us we were not to be in any hurry. But with our breakfast coming out in mere minutes, and the small portions we were done quickly. The line to pay was really long. That was just bad timing on our part. But the line wrapped along the wall, and in front of the kitchen where the servers all come and go with food. It was hectic. Not the greatest experience, but we will give it another try.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with this restaurant today. My friends and family meet every Saturday at Egg Works near Sunset Park. The one time we decide to branch out to the other restaurants and it doesn't start off well at all. Our organizer checked it out a week ago and even called in a reservation for our large group. We get here and they apologize profusely because they allowed a large party of 17 people in just before us and pretty much told us calling in advance for reservations does not do any good. Not professional or organized. Not good for planned large parties, especially parties with several elderly and handicapped members.   If you do want one that will actually honor large planned gatherings, professionally and with organizational skills, one who won't blame your party for their lack of both, then try Egg Works on Sunset. Not good, The Cracked Egg, not good.   I'll update if we ever get a table.  We were seated at 30 min after we arrived and now feeling a little better. The server was very nice and prompt.   Okay, now that I've had coffee and my MIL is comfortable, I'm going to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Menu looks nice and I'm excited to try the coffee cake.   Food and service was excellent. They don't do muffins like Egg Works, but they do make a very tasty apple cinnamon cream cheese coffee cake. We might try again for our group brunch and we hope it was just a fluke.",

    "text": "This place is very near to several other places I do business. So when I saw featured in a \"breakfast\" edition of Las Vegas Weekly, I made sure to stop in.  The strong suit of this venue is the creativity of its menu. There were no less than seven versions of Eggs Benedict, for example. Pastrami Benedict, Mexican Benedict, Veggie Benedict with Avacado, et. al. The entire menu was extremely diverse for a breakfast joint. There's a lunch/sandwich menu as well.  After that, much credit for customer service. Twice, the BUSBOY stopped to offer refills on my coffee.  My selections were tasty enough. Said another way, the food was of good quality. Not \"rock my world\" quality, but well above-average.  I think this place best fits, for me, as a morning-after breakfast nook with a lady friend. Solo, I'm still heading for Omelet House, where there are also many choices (though not quite as diverse as here), but the portions are much larger, for about the same price.",

    "text": "Okay this is a great place for a quick and casual breakfast. Where I haven't tried everything I am a big fan of the Veggie Benny. The dish is served on traditional English muffins, topped with tomatoes, poached eggs and avocado, smothered in hollandaise. Yet don't forget the Potatoes, these little squares, seem to be deep fried and seasoned yet not quite to perfection, but all the same they are good. I would say that the hollandaise could be thicker. But as a whole this restaurant has a menu with a wide range of traditional breakfast and lunch favorites. This wham bam breakfast joint, is a nice place to go with family and friends in a very relaxed environment, even appropriate for a quick breakfast or lunch for any business oriented outing. This location is definitely going to give the corporate chop shops, IHOP, Denny's, and the Original Pancake House a worthy competitor in the turf war that is breakfast. Surely The Cracked Egg has more of a local, friendly, and welcoming environment than its corporate competitors as well. Please stop by this restaurant and give it a shot. It is at Green valley just off pebble in the smiths parking lot.",

Again hope management or the owner reads this post.  -No one to greet us, waited 5 minutes or so, sat ourselves. -Noticed only one very busy super nice guy named Juan working his butt off. -Within 20 minutes, Juan (by himself, no one else in the dinning room) was handling 14 tables  and over 35 diners by himself.  -More people coming in and no one to set them.  Juan running around trying to accomplish everything....greeting some of the people, running water and coffee, serving, busing, etc.  to now almost 20 tables with over 50 diners...(yes I am counting, my wife told me to stop).  But I was amazed by watching Juan do all these task.    I hope Juan gets paid as a greeter host, server, food runner, bus person, and cashier because he certainly was doing all of these jobs almost seamlessly.   Food prices have increased quite a bit.  Had the Chicken, gravy, eggs, hash browns, toast.  -Eggs were good. -Their gravy is not bad, I would say good...but not as good as Mr Mama's! -Chicken was not good, mostly hard breaded batter.  I remember the chicken as being much better. -HASH BROWNS...well awesome, probably the best that I have had here in town!  This place has so much potential and I really want to like it.  Saves me over 12 miles round trip from going to Mr Mamas (Rated #1 on yelp I believe) on Jones and Russell.  Oh, by 7am a young lady showed up to help Juan, whew!    **********   FIVE STARS TO JUAN!   ***********",

There usually isn't a wait unless it is Saturday or Sunday morning between 8-12.  In that case, the most you usually would have to wait is 30-45 minutes to get a table.    Everything here is very affordable ranging between $7-15 dollars for a large portioned meal.    My favorites at cracked egg:  The Monte Cristo Turkey, ham and swiss cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried. served with hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  This is absolutely amazing and hits so many of your senses that it will confuse you but it is delicious!    Coconut Macadamia Short stacks are a great side to add to any of the meals.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the oatmeal overload is a HUGE bowl of oats, loaded with nuts, raisins, berries, and granola on the side.    Another one of my favorites is The Country Benny:  a biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs and smothered in gravy  Overall, I am a big fan of the cracked egg.  The service has always been friendly and prompt.  The food is good and affordable.",

Despite the reviews to the contrary, the staff was pleasant and attentive, without hovering. They asked if we wanted anything else before bringing the check and offered refills when our drinks were just less than half empty.  My friend ordered the Eggs Benny, which she said was good. The hash browns looked and were uncooked, but they were not greasy, so trade off. The eggs could have used slightly more hollandaise sauce, but our server was happy to bring more when asked.  I ordered the Monte Cristo on the servers rec. I was considering the Eggs benny also. It was good but nothing to write about, truly. I would have liked the option being offered, on menu, of jam or syrup. I choose the seasoned potatoes. They were so NOT seasoned. They were barely salted, but hey, not too greasy also. They were also not too crunchy or crispy, lol. But I did eat them, so they were tasty after adding salt and pepper. They just were not what I expected to receive based on the word \"Seasoned\"  Overall, I will go back and try other menu items. It was clean, the staff was pleasant and efficient, the food tasted good. The prices were reasonable. It is not close to my home, but for those in the area, check this place out if you haven't already.  Why wouldn't you?",

Though it was a tad pricey for what I got, it was a re-creation of something I love at Magnolia Cafe in Austin, and it also had eggs.  I got the skillet, which is the seasoned potatoes, melted jack and cheddar cheese, and 2 eggs any style - then I get to add toppings.  The eggs - poached easy with perfectly runny yolks.  I got tomatillo sauce, scallions (not a choice but still got em), and avocado slices.  This combo just works, and it clogs the arteries too, but it is soooooo delicious.  I also tasted Eric R.'s coffee cake that came with his omelette - it was more like dessert but steaming hot, a welcome change from the cold cake slices at Starbucks.  Only confusing thing is when you walk in, there is a line for the cashier, but no hostess.  It took us awhile to find someone to seat us.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this is a good restaurant however the service and quality in repeat orders, needs work. If you're looking for a tasty brunch spot The Cracked Egg has several options. The restaurant is a little busy for my liking, which also effects the overall service. To avoid this, I have been ordering take out for the past few months. All in all about 20 mins to get your order. I'm a creature of habit so the Country Benny is my go to. When ordering, the gentleman who answers phones on the weekends, usually asks how you want the eggs cooked. Poached. Benny's come with poached runny eggs, anything else is a sin. Fight me.   Each time I get this order, the eggs are unpredictable. While I am not always asked about how I'd like the eggs prepared, that all depends on who takes my order. Will I get hard poached this time? Another fun one is when the two eggs are cooked differently, with one runny and one cooked completely hard. This is disappointing as I can't exactly send it back. I'm also not trying to be the guy examining the food before I take it out of the restaurant.   I'll of course be back because the food really is delicious. But hope all the food that comes out of the kitchen is held to the same caliber, regardless of whether it's eaten in the restaurant or carried out.",

Some are very attentive, others seem to forget that you even exist. I'm not a huge breakfast fan, so I get the pastrami on rye every time. Sometimes the meat is great, sometimes not so much. Sometimes the bread is good, sometimes not so much. Then you have times like today where half of it was great, and the other half was horrible. Bread was soggy and disgusting. But that first half was delicious! Chances are I'll be back because my daughter loves it.",

It's your typical sit down breakfast/lunch place with omelets, pancakes, skillets, sandwiches and burgers. The portions are fairly large and the prices are decent. We always have left overs no matter what we order.   I've tried breakfast and lunch items, but honestly nothing really stands out as \"wow I need to order this again.\" The only thing worth mentioning is their COFFEE CAKE! It's served warm and it's so so soft. The flavor changes daily but my favorite has got to be the strawberry or the pumpkin. Even if I order a burger, I will still order me a side of coffee cake, it's that good.   The service is hit or miss. I've had servers who looked happy to be there. However, I've also had servers who hated their lives and it showed. On our last visit, our server seemed to be rushing through the motions. No biggie though. The one thing I'm definitely not a fan of is the waiting area. It can get congested really fast. With customers having to go to the register to pay, that just adds to even more congestion.  I'm not in any rush to eat here again. But I wouldn't be opposed for someone suggested this for breakfast.",

    "text": "Plenty of great breakfast places throughout the Las Vegas valley, but this has to be toward the top of the list. Has a nice mix of a \"diner\" feel while being clean, modern, and having the service experience you'd expect in a regular restaurant. We managed to time our visit just right as we were seated immediately. Since we have kids, it's always nice to have a menu for them to color. They provide colored pencils for kids instead of crayons, so just a heads up if you have little little ones.   My wife ordered the Carnitas omelette. I always hesitate to get things like that because the Carnitas aren't usually authentic and it ends up just being regular pork. In this case, they were perfect. Very flavorful and loaded into the omelette. It's also topped with a healthy amount of sour cream. Very balanced, delicious dish.   I opted for the ham and eggs. The ham steak is huge, well prepped, and goes great with however you take your eggs. We also both got the seasoned potatoes with our meals and they were super good. Sides are always best when they compliment the main dish  and the potatoes do just that. Well seasoned, large portion, and just crispy enough on the outside while staying soft on the inside. Could not be better cooked.   The real kicker of the meal was the coffee cake. Instead of toast or other bread, you can opt for coffee cake with your meal. Since we went in the fall, the coffee cake was pumpkin chocolate chip flavored. It was delicious, light, and humongous. It's a little lighter than a traditional coffee cake, but still very good.   Service was top notch throughout our experience. Even paying our check at the front after we were done was incredibly smooth despite the entrance being packed with people.   Definitely a can't miss experience, even if you're coming from the strip. Well worth the 10-15 minute drive for some great food and prompt service.",

They were spot on with medium poached eggs and extremely generous with the spinach & avocado. My holding back on the five star review was that the hollandaise sauce was just not as acid as it should be, needed more lemon & had a sweetness that was a bit off putting. The hash browns were just okay, a tad greasy for me. My friend ordered eggs scrambled with cream cheese and a veggie and she thoroughly enjoyed it. She had coffee and said it was also very good. Bottom line for me is the Veggie Bennie will always keep me coming back and our server, Cynthia was attentive and very courteous.",

    "text": "Pretty darn good breakfast. I was going to go to our usual morning grub spot (original house of pancakes) at Green Valley, but decided to try something new. I got an omlette and it came with a coffee cake. IT WAS AMAZING! BEST COFFEE CAKE EVERRRRR!! All warm and crumbly. So perfect. That set me up nicely for the omlette. The eggs were fluffy and the hash browns were nice, burnt and crispy, JUST like i requested them. Service was great. Didn't have to wait at all and just overall a good, non-touristy atmosphere. Lots of locals. Oh and very fair priced! Will be back again and recommend it to anyone in the area!",

    "text": "Originally I discovered the The Cracked Egg on Rainbow years ago. I am glad they have a second location close to where I am living. I think one of their highlights is their Homemade Coffee Cake. I used to ask which flavor they currently had available but soon stopped after I had a few different ones and they were ALL delicious. This morning I was treated to Blueberry! I've had Apple, Peach and Cherry as well.  When I crave going out for breakfast which is usually on the weekends, The Cracked Egg is on the top of my list. My favorite is their \"Californian\" omelet which has sliced bacon, sliced avocados and jack cheese with seasoned potatoes on the side.  Based on my visits to both locations their service and food are great. They seem to always have plenty of people around taking care of guests so even if your server is busy you can always find someone to get you a refill or extra condiments, etc.  I think their prices are fair and portion sized from my experience and what friends/family have ordered is good.  If you beat the breakfast rush you should get seated within a timely manner. I went around 10AM and was able to get a seat at the counter right away and they appeared to have a few tables open. When I was paying my bill to leave they were slammed with people crowding the entrance waiting for tables.  Always leave full and enjoy going to The Cracked Egg for a weekend breakfast. Also a side note, on some occasions I had phoned in my breakfast order with their Rainbow location and within a timely manner went to pay/pickup and enjoy at home.",

    "text": "YUM!!! I go to The Cracked Egg for breakfast and lunch whenever I can. I'm stuck on the Veggie Benny right now, but the Greek omelet and Chile Verde Rancheros are great too. My husband says they have great coffee and don't forget the coffee cake (just the best), which is like a light angel food goodness with either apples or chocolate chips and always freshly baked and warm. Everything is incredibly fresh at this place.   The service is friendly and they will split meals as well. They also have half orders of the salads, which are pretty large. It's a popular place, so get there early if you don't want to wait (but the wait isn't too bad). Goes to show you, good food draws a crowd.",

    "text": "Went this morning for our first time and we will not return!  The food was decent.  Service was TERRIBLE!    Reading Paul W's post, it seems we had similar experiences.    Employees (from the hostess to the manager) did not create a warm and inviting dining experience.  No smiles, very curt staff , our server  acted impatient and annoyed with husband when placing his order, restaurant was freezing cold ... A/C and fans going when it is 60 degrees out;  we mentioned the cold temperature to 3 different employees and not one person offered to adjust the air ...  I was wearing a sweater and the hostess was wearing a sweater and scarf ... you would think someone would take notice!    In addition to having an awful experience ourselves, we witnessed our server display the same rude attitude toward a neighboring customer when they asked questions and sent their meal back.     Immediately following our visit, we sent an email to their \"corporate\" email address.  As I suspected, we have not received a return email or call despite providing our phone number.   It is VERY CLEAR that this restaurant does not value their customers!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "When we first arrived in Vegas, we visited The Cracked Egg on Rainbow. It was okay but nothing special. So when we found ourselves in Henderson during breakfast time and with a coupon, we decided to try it again.  It was about 1pm on Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Not a red flag really because the recession is killing the restaurant business. Service was pretty quick - sat down, ordered drinks from the helper, the waiter was so fast that I had to ask for a couple more minutes, and he came back in a couple of minutes. All was going well until I ordered. Club Sandwich - no ham, no mayo, bacon crispy, 1000 island dressing on the side - and fries. \"Sorry, we ran out of fries.\" What???? No fries???? Big red flag - obviously the fries are not made fresh. But, you may be thinking, perhaps they just ran out of potatoes. Possible, yes, but they still had the breakfast potatoes that were served with my husband's meal. So, I am really not happy about this situation. Not because of there being no fries as much as them not being made fresh. I mean, seriously, In-N-Out makes fries - from real potatoes - all day long. However, I did regroup and try to enjoy my lunch.  As I said, I had the Club Sandwich. It was good - came with avocado and cheese which is a huge bonus for me and not always included. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. And, believe it or not, it was too big for my mouth so I had to cut it up.   My husband had a Sausage Scramble which was not actually scrambled together but layered. He said it was quite nice (that is like 4 stars in ratings talk). And, his coffee was getting refilled promptly AND they gave him more creamers than he could use. So, overall, great meal for the hubby.  I have seen some of the other reviews raving about the breakfast items and perhaps that is where I went wrong. If we go again (which we probably will since I have another coupon), I am thinking I will try the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. I will let you know.",

One of the times I went was with a group from work, at least 8 people. Service was quick, efficient and food was great. One tome before that and one time after, I was alone as I am most of the time. Service was slow both times, I had a diet coke( don't drink coffee) which finally came halfway thru the meal. I tried to get the servers attention to no avail. The last time when the bill came, I was charged for a diet coke and coffee. I asked the server about it and it took her 5 minutes to tell me that she couldn't figure outhow to refund the $2.00. So she gave me $2 out of her pocket.    I sort of blame the iffy service level on thefact that I know servers hate waiting on one person because they know the tip won't be as much. Food is good  Service is so- so",

And I'm very picky with my breakfast, particularly my eggs.  I ordered the Veggie Benny, which is their vegetarian version of eggs benedict. It has avocados, grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, two poached eggs, and Hollandaise sauce.   I don't even know how to express how much I love this place. It came with a side of buttery hash browns--and by buttery, I don't mean greasy, I mean deliciously rich. The Veggie Benny was amazing. Seriously. It was the perfect blend of fresh eggs, creamy Hollandaise sauce, freshness from the spinach and avocado, and just a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. My boyfriend got something to eat too, and he loved it. I don't remember what he got, probably because I was too busy trying to stuff my face full of amazing-ness. (I think he got waffles or pancakes?)  The service was ok. But the taste-gasm I had made up for the so-so service.   Overall, I LOVED this place. I wish they were open at night.",

I have tried many things but my two favorites are the Country Benny..its Eggs Benedict with a biscuit and sausage and gravy on top. I'm sure its about 5,000 calories but well worth it especially when you are hung over. My other favorite is the El Vaquero...its a chorizo omelette with salsa and cheese on top. Amazing! I know they are owned by the same people, but this one is far better than the one on Rainbow.",

Sat down and was able to quickly give my order to the counter waitress.  I did a glucose blood test, estimated the carbohydrate count for my selected item, put the numbers into my insulin pump, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally a guy from the kitchen brings a meal only to be told by the waitress rushing to his side, that it is the wrong order...she incorrectly had provided the wrong item on the chef ticket.  I was about ready to say that that was fine...I'll take the corned beef instead of the pastrami sandwich, but she whisked it away and was gone.  She said it was her mistake and a pastrami would be out soon.  So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I stood up to go and she came running out saying it was not done on purpose.....What?  Why would she say that?  I left and quickly made it to another egg house on the same road.  Bye Cracked Egg - You will not be seeing me again.",

We had the following:  The Veggie Skillet with Corned Beef $10.90  The Sweet Potato Skillet $10.50  Coconut and macadamia nut pancakes $8.95  My veggie skillet was pretty good. I loved the mix of broccoli, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes with the fried potatoes (and meat of course). My wife gave her skillet 6/10 bc she said her potatoes were not so crispy. I wouldn't recommend the pancakes as the coconut is not fresh coconut but coconut from a prepackaged bag. That kind of coconut is too sweet and with added syrup made the dish too sweet for my tastebuds. The one good aspect here is that the skillets came with their signature coffee cake (or toast if u prefer). Their coffee cake was pretty good. The texture was so light and soft and way better than Starbucks. After 4 or 5 bites however, it does becomes a little too sweet so I suggest sharing one with another person.",

I know it's not a problem if the establishment isn't busy which it wasn't) she rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed as she went to go ask about another table. Today the blonde older hostess told a couple who was outside \"could you guys have gone any further?!\" The wife was flabbergasted and said \"Yeah actually I could have.\" Lolololol.",

Ambience- It's clean and simply decorated. Very open with booths and a small counter area to eat at.  Service- Considering we were the only table here I did expect more. Our server was friendly enough and provided efficient service. Can't complain.  Food- We ordered the Monte Cristo w/ hash browns, The Carnitas omelet w/potatoes and blueberry coffee cake, and chocolate pancakes w/ side of bacon. We all shared the coffee cake. It was moist and fresh but we all agreed that the blueberries did not compliment the coffee cake. My son enjoyed his Monte Cristo but said he wouldn't eat it again. My omelet was dry, flat, and tasteless. I did expect so much more. Maybe my food choices wasn't the best, but it was recommended by the server.   3 stars for being clean, decent service, having a great coffee cake recipe (subtract the blueberries), being reasonably priced, and having a good selection of items on the menu. It's not a bad place, it just wasn't for me.",

As always the food was delicious and the server was great (thank you Vanessa).  After finishing our meal, I paid the bill and my husband and I decided not to rush off, but to relax a couple of minutes, talk, and finish off our beverages.  It was then that the restaurant manager, \"Monica\", came over to our table and asked if there was anything else we needed.  We said no and she replied \"have a good day\".  A few minutes later Monica and one of her colleagues came and stood near our table.  Every few seconds she would look my way--I guess they wanted us to leave.  When my husband got up to go to the cash register, Monica said to her colleague, \"didn't they just go get change?\"  And in fact I had, but needed additional change to give our sever, Vanessa, a larger tip.  While my husband waited in line at the register, Monica returned to the register area and told a waiting customer, \"we are trying to get you seated together, but some people just won't leave, you know how that is\".  \"Monica\" is unprofessional and should NOT be serving in a leadership role at your restaurant.  I guess it's time for my family to find another restaurant for Sunday brunch.",

We both ordered black coffee and were pleasantly surprised how good and smooth it was. I drank 2 cups! My mom ordered huevos rancheros. I ordered the pesto scramble with seasoned potatoes and toast. We also split a banana pancake. Everything was so yummy and the portions were a good size. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Stopped here when visiting Las Vegas. After reading the reviews I was worried about the service but still wanted to go because of their gluten free menu. When we arrived the service was great. Nothing spectacular but definitely not rude like some comments imply.  We ordered a burger which I heard was great and I had a gluten free skillet without eggs (they happily substituted fruit for it). Both seasoned potatoes and toast may have cross contamination so I stuck with the hash browns and a gluten free muffin. This is where it gets AMAZING. I have never eaten such a good gluten free muffin. I was really scared that it wasn't gluten free after all. But no reaction. So I ordered an extra one for the road. Still scared while I'm eating it now. Seems too good to be True ;-)  Overall great gluten free safe breakfast joint with the best muffins. #happyceliac",

Basic issue is that the food wasn't special and it was overpriced. With tax and tip I walked out of here paying $10 for a bowl of oatmeal. It wasn't steel cut oats, just regular Quaker Oats you add water to and it was served with brown sugar, milk, cheap cereal stale granola and a cup of berries, mostly blackberries. It was a healthy portion of oatmeal, but it should have cost closer to $5. I did try the coffee cake, which was good but not out of this world.    I would rather go to the Egg and I or Bread and Butter for the same price. You get a lot tastier food.",

    "text": "This remains the best breakfast place I have ever dined at. They proudly display their many restaurant awards around the restaurant-- awards which are well earned. The atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable-- the decorations aren't overly fancy but the interior is fairly well maintained.  Service tends to be pretty good here--even when it gets busy. The girls at the front can get pretty swamped during the Sunday rush but they always get the bill worked out right in the end. The waiters are pretty friendly and they know their menu pretty well. Subsitutions can be usually be made without much fuss. The coffee is pretty good, and the coffee cake is heavenly ( you need to try it at least once.)  The seasoned potatoes do definitely stand out here-- they are easily the best I've ever tasted. They aren't overly seasoned, arent too greasiy, and they have a satisfying crunchiness to them. Portions here are pretty hefty--maybe not Hash-House-A-Go-Go big, but respectable. Bring a decent appetite to make your trip here worthwhile.  I've tried a number of their dishes, from their fluffy and satisfying pancakes to their wide variety of egg dishes. Waffles are heavenly here--much better than you would find at IHOP or other large corporate spots. There aren't too many skillet options but I suggest you try  the vegetable egg skillet with chicken. The signature egg dishes go well with a side of cholula sauce but most are so well seasoned that you may not find you need it. The omelettes are fluffy and cooked just right. They never skimp on avocadoes or meat here. The wheat toast always arrives lathered in real butter. I recently enjoyed their unique pesto scramble. The french toast is rich and flavorful. This place simply does breakfast right and has earned its keep as one of the elite breakfast destinations in Clark County.",

Kalila really enjoyed The Green Scrambler. I don't remember if that's the right title, but it was the last item on the SCRAMBLERS section of the menu. It had spinach, broccoli, and other vegetables in it. She was so happy with her choice!  I had the big bad wolf. It is the equivalent of a meat lover's pizza, but for an omelet. There's bacon, ham, sausage....  Everyone has to try to coffee cake side at least once (served as an option next to buttered toast)  This place is always busy and plenty of times there will be a wait. The time you lose in the wait, you make up for in how quickly your food comes out.  All of my servers have always been very nice and friendly.",

    "text": "I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but there's no option for it.  Upon entering this place, I did get more a crowded and intense fast paced feeling rather than a homey breakfast feeling.  The wait for a table was 5-10 mins which I thought was good, considering they were slammed with a bunch of families.    Once being seated I read the menu thoroughly, just so I would get something I liked rather than something I'd hate.  After a good 5 mins our waitress came out and gave us our drinks, she then returned later to take our order.  I thought that her knowledge about the food was a little less than pleasing.  I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with.   Orders were:   Monte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.    Biscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.    There were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast.",

However neither of us have had the desire to return recently. In a nutshell, service is not up to par and the food has been mediocre at best.   First of all, I get that the servers may be tired considering they open at 6am but don't take that out on the patrons. The last couple times my boyfriend and I have been here we've felt rushed from the moment we sat down. And it's not one server in particular, it's all of them. Often we get asked if we know what we want to eat before we even order our drinks. Then 30 seconds after we get our food the check is dropped off. Can they be any more obvious that they want to go home? Doesn't make me feel welcome.   Secondly, the food has been a hit and miss lately. The skillets are always excellent. My favorite breakfast is eggs benedict and the last time I got it here it was very cold like it had been sitting out. *thumbs down* However, the coffee cake is great which is why I'm giving this place 2 stars.   Overall, I feel like the cracked egg could go back to what it used to be if changes are made and the staff are taught what QUALITY and SERVICE are. I won't be returning anytime soon.",

So sorry you have to pay for your family of five! News flash: it's expensive for more people wherever you go. There is only one girl I have had a problem with and recently, we have not seen her. I have never been rushed in there. We have had several different waitresses and waiters and never once have we had a problem. If you go in there acting entitled and asking six billion questions just to be a pain in the ass, I commend people for giving right back to you. Be pleasant and others will return the favor. Keep it up staff, do not let these people get to you! :)",

    "text": "This is my favorite place to eat breakfast hands down! There's nothing I love more in the world then a good brunch ya hear? I always order the Veggy Benny, my husband switches things up. The Veggy Benny, in my opinion, is basically made of magic. It's spot on and I have nothing but rave reviews. My husband loves their south shore scramble. He recently tried their monte crisco, basically a ham and cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried, he said it was meh and should be served at a carnival so I wouldn't recommend that dish unless you're a carni, I feel like carni's don't read reviews though. The potatoes that come with your breakfast have a great spice to them. I've had the same ones at various other breakfast hubs but they're my fav so I'm happy. Now on to the famous coffee cake. First off all you yelp readers should know that I absolutely hate cake in general. I don't have a sweet tooth and I'm just not down with the fluffy cake consistency. For some reason though the coffee cake here is irresistible! They switch up the flavors every day, chocolate chip is my fav. I've never tried crack (hi mom) but this coffee cake is so crazy good that I believe it may be just as addictive as crack. Defiantly. Maybe.",

Given that it's right down the street, Boyfriend and I decided to give The Cracked Egg a shot. Our 5 minute wait to be seated was great for 10:30 on a Saturday morning. Once seated, our drink order was taken almost immediately; actual drinks followed shortly. We ordered about 5 minutes after being seated. Twenty minutes later, food arrived! I had the traditional benedict. Boyfriend had the country benedict. I was floored by how delicious my food was. The eggs were wonderfully runny, the hollandaise was excellent and the Canadian bacon was smokey with no gristly bits. My side of hashbrowns was very tasty. Always a plus when there's enough egg yolk and hollandaise to dredge hashbrowns in!   Service was quick and friendly. Food is seriously good, if slightly on the pricey side ($32, including tip, for two people). This probably won't be a weekly spot, but we'll definitely be back!",

They serve potatoes similar to the ones at Egg Works/Egg and I, but I find the seasoning to be lacking at Cracked Egg.  So, I ask for extra seasoning on the side.  The chicken fried steak is VERY solid at this place.  Additionally, the specials are usually good, so check those out.  It's a large restaurant, so even during heavy traffic times the wait is usually not awful.  Also, kid friendly.",

    "text": "You had me at stuffed french toast! Being a french toast connoisseur it takes a lot to impress me and the Cracked Egg certainly did that.    I went one morning after 9 am with a friend for a late breakfast and we both wanted something special. That is why we choose to try their stuffed french toast. We looked at all sorts of breakfast places before deciding to come here. All thanks to the menu having something different, stuffed french toast.  My friend ordered the Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast while I had the Raspberry Stuffed French Toast. With these, you better have an appetite. Each come with six slices of stuffed french toast with a side of butter and syrup(which is overkill, the stuffed french toast prepared as is enough). The Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast comes with bananas and, of course peanut butter, although chocolate would also be nice. The Raspberry Stuffed French Toast has a raspberry cream cheese filling with some berries and powder sugar sprinkled on top. If you want anything else, you have to order is as a side but the Stuffed French Toast will have you stuffed all by itself.   The place was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes. Our waiter seemed to caught up in what he was doing and wasn't really engaging any of the diners. He wasn't terrible but he just seemed to be doing his job instead of giving good service. Because of that, I feel I can't give them a 5 star rating.",

    "text": "I LOVE BREAKFAST. Well, I love food in general, but breakfast is happiness. I LOVE a great breakfast restaurant. After being torn away from Walker Brothers in Highland Park, IL when we moved to Vegas, I was desperate to find a comfortable, relaxed, no hassle breakfast eatery. Cracked Egg is one of them.  Their menu is great. I love that they have many different options: salad, soup, chili, omelet, chicken sandwiches and even burgers. I'm the kind of person that could eat a Thanksgiving dinner at 6:00AM, so variation is key. However, the more important is their massive gluten free menu. Cracked Egg's GF menu is one of the largest I've ever seen at any restaurant. PLUS, I could eat their seasoned potatoes and/or hash browns. I stuck with the hash browns because there is a small chance of cross contamination, but I was not disappointed; they were delicious!  It took me 15 minutes to make up my mind as to what to eat, and of course, when the waitress came to the table I changed my mind last minute and got the North Shore Scramble. Holy freaking happiness. Eggs were cooked perfectly, not runny but not dried out. All the ingredients were fresh, and those hash browns may have been standard, but you have no idea how great it was to 1. Eat hash browns without getting gluten-ed and 2. Too many places mess up hash browns and make my frown like a sad panda.The bacon was nice and crispy and gave it nice saltiness. I considered ordering another dish, the chili skillet, just to ensure the explosion of my stomach, but alas, I could not eat anymore.  My fiance ordered the standard eggs with kielbasa. Oh that kielbasa melted in my mouth - it was pure fatty processed foody goodness. I don't care what it's made out of. The kielbasa was great when smushed inbetween slices of toast and eggs. Thankfully, he gave me a couple bites of the kielbasa before he gluten-ed up his plate. I'm a huge fan of them cooking it on the flat top/griddle. The outside had a great snappy crust on it and was not too greasy. Oh, yummy pork product, I love you.  I will absolutely come here again, probably for their chili skillet. Yes, their chili skillet is gluten free. Gluten free chili at a restaurant other than Wendy's?!? YES PLEASE!!! Chili and I have a love affair every football season, but I think I will cheat on it soon and enjoy it at The Cracked Egg in a couple weeks. Or maybe I will have one of their sandwiches that is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Yes, this way I can rationalize eating 400 calories of moo-cow...because it's wrapped in veggies! Thank you Cracked Egg. Good service, delicious food and a great restaurant environment. Love.  P.S. Anytime you want to make gluten free coffee cake, please let me know and I will taste test it for you!  P.P.S. They have GF pancakes. I know exactly what I'm getting next time!",

Nothing on the menu is out of the ordinary and its convenience of having 5 locations spread out throughout town is nice. I've been to almost all of them and they all serve the same quality of food and flavor. Also, they have a gluten sensitive menu available too and you can check it out on their webpage.   Whether you're in the mood for their \"breanne's basic\", \"fluffy and folded omelettes\" or \"eggs with attitude scramble\" you can't go wrong. Also, depending on how busy they are you might opt out of ordering an omelette since per usual they take longer to make. The portions are generous as well.   Today, I got a veggie skillet with turkey bacon. I was thrown off by the turkey bacon since it looks liked ham. It didn't taste like your regular turkey bacon too.   Overall it's a plain Jane spot with bland coffee to their entrees and sometimes that's exactly want you may want for the first meal of the day. And if it's not then bring your own sauce for flavor! Lol Oh and the service is just as bland. Perhaps out server had a case of the Mondays or something.",

    "text": "Still one of the best breakfast spots in Las Vegas. This location is in Henderson so if you live in the area or are just driving through the area, you don't need to look any further for a solid place to eat. This place is all about simple egg dishes, pancakes, french toast and coffee cake. Their homemade coffee cake is to die for when hot, so make sure when asked if you want toast or coffee cake you order the coffee cake.  I often get scrambled eggs, with home fries, and sausage patties here, mostly because it reminds me of how these things taste back home in New Jersey. The potatoes are seasoned in a spicy cajun mix which I really love, the eggs taste farm fresh and the sausage patties are always juicy and delicious.  If you are in the mood for lunch they also have a tons of salads, sandwiches and burgers to choose from. My favorite lunch items are the patty melt with pepper jack cheese or the tuna melt. Both come with a side (usually fries) and both were good choices. I still would suggest sticking to breakfast though, as that is their top specialty, not lunch.  The thing that puts this place on my radar besides the quality breakfast is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here after years of going on the weekends, weekdays, whenever. Keep in mind they are only open from 7am-3pm, so plan accordingly.   Like others have said, this is not the kind of place you need to go across town for, but if your in the neighborhood or live around the area, than it's worth trying out at least once. Much better then any strip breakfast you could find.",

Evidently, there's some sort of unspoken rule that says if you order gluten free toast as part of your breakfast, you don't want it buttered. Figured I was ahead of the game by requesting buttered, but maybe that is just too much to ask?",

Second,  there was a lot of cross contamination going on. I have went to school for culinary so I know all the requirements working in a kitchen and serving food. My server kept rubbing his nose because it was running. Also, he coughed in his hands and then went to vet the toast out and put it on my plate and served me. Then as I'm eating I found an eye lash in my potatoes. The server was caucasian and had tattoos. Will never go there again thanks to him.",

    "text": "Pretty much an A-OK experience all around  Food: the coffee cake really was the star of the meal. Hot, fluffy, and flavorful. Extremely cinnamony. Was gone in a second. Veggie benny was pretty good, though I tend to prefer my poached eggs more gooey than completely runny. The hollandaise was not too heavy. The hash browns were crispy on the outside / tops and bottoms, but somewhat soggy in the centers. The chicken-fried steak was perfectly crispy on the outside, and the gravy was good. I'm not sure what all the hullabaloo about the seasoned potatoes is - ours were hard, dry, and extremely salty.   Service: came right at lunchtime on a Saturday, but managed to get seated right away. Service started out great, but after the initial greeting, any time we needed anything we had to flag down the waitress. The only time she spontaneously stopped by was to drop off the bill, about 5 minutes after the food came out. Upon checkout, if you pay with a card, the hostess asks if you would like to add a tip to the card. I find this incredibly uncomfortable and puts pressure on patrons to tip maybe more than they normally would. I would much rather have them include a tip line on the receipt so I can tip as much or as little as I would like without feeling guilty or embarrassed. Maybe they do this on purpose to help their waitstaff earn more money in tips? Next time I will bring cash to leave on the table instead.",

The season coffee cake was strawberry which was excellent however I've come to the conclusion their coffee cake isn't really coffee cake, it's more like a hybrid angel food cake but it's still delicious. The last few times I've visited the coffee cake has been a fruit that I'm allergic too so it was great to finally have a piece that wasn't mango or peach. I think they should have a regular like crumb/brown sugar coffee cake as an option as well, I feel like they'd do a great job at it.   Go eat breakfast here, it's delicious",

I started to notice that only person's of color were seated on this side. So I got up to look at the other (brighter) side. And, I was right. What confirmed my suspicions was an African American couple came in and was seated in the back section. I saw that all other couples were seated in the front. My and I are an interracial couple. We haven't experienced this in over 20 yrs. You should be ashamed.  The bright side was our waitress. Hispanic,  by the way. She only working in the back?",

The staff doesn't smile feels like I was dealing with robots. I burned and spilled my food during the transfer of hands between the runner and I and she just walked away. I had to use my water cup to soak my thumb while eating my breakfast. The food was still good but eating it was uncomfortable. The entire staff could use an adjustment as to working in food and beverage atmosphere. I believe I seen the manager but was so upset didn't feel it would make a difference if I brought it to his attention. I allowed my husband to tip as I blame the runner and management. Seriously a disappointing experience. It's a shame that they witness an injury and just walked away. I'm so glad I didn't see her on my way out cause I was looking for her and was going to show her my finger and teach her how to treat people",

Indistinguishable from anywhere else. Probably should've got the French Toast. Whatever. It's fine. My girlfriend got the Lighten Up scramble and that was trash. The turkey in it was like lunch meat - Hillshire Farms style - which is also whatever, except it was such poor quality lunch meat. It was gross. We also weren't aware that the toast would come soaked in butter. She ate the potatoes and a little bit of toast and that was it, turkey ruined the scramble. It wasn't that bad overall, just very middling. Which, coupled with the other reviews, left a lot to be desired. In short, underwhelming. Might go back, might not. Staff was nice, no complaints about them.",

I wouldn't say you need to venture across town to check this place out... Definitely not that phenomenal of a breakfast spot but it's enough to satisfy the taste buds!   The first time I went, I was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something I had never had before! This being said, I went with the Monte Cristo. The dish in and of itself is out of the ordinary and I honestly REALLY enjoyed it! It was weird but a good weird! I would definitely get it again.   My second time (and third... And probably will again on my fourth visit) here I got the bacon cheeseburger skillet. I love this skillet! It's the perfect mix of lunch and breakfast in one plate!! Want a cheeseburger but want eggs and potatoes too? Boom! It's all right there in your skillet.   One day I do plan on trying an omelette of theirs that has polish sausage in it (being Polish, that'll be a real taste challenge!). When I do I'll be sure to let everyone know how it is!   The thing that makes this place truly awesome, is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here! Granted, I've somehow managed to get the same server the last two times I've been, it doesn't matter. From what I could see all the staff is friendly and on their game!   Like I said, not the kind of place you need to venture across town for, but if your in the neighborhood or live around the corner like me, than it's worth a stop!",

I ordered the corned beef hash with two poached eggs, hash browns and coffee cake. The corned beef was fresh and homemade, not that canned stuff and seasoned perfectly with bell peppers and onions. The hash browns were good but nothing out of the ordinary but my mom had the country potatoes and she said they were \"really good\" with a smile. The coffee cake was also an added bonus and delicious. It came out before our meal and was nice and warm!  My husband ordered an omelette with sausage (can't remember which one) but he devoured it. He also added country gravy, which I initially thought was a little gross but it was actually pretty damn good!   Service was good and everyone was friendly.

I like this restaurant very much. The one complaint I have is their coffee sucks. But the coffee sucks in 99.99% of all restaurants everywhere.

They move tables quickly, and you will be seated within the time they say.   Our server, who ironically I had the first time was fantastic!   The menu offers a large variety of breakfast items - skillets, omelets, and  eggs anyway you like... Along with it you get hash browns or skillet potatoes, toast or coffee cake..

The side of potatoes were 'ok'...nothing special... they need seasoning or something but I don't really need the extra starch... so I left them.

I have gone here a couple of times and the service and the foods never fails me.. the wait may be a bit long.. i dont recall them taking reservations either.. But for a party of two i only waited for 5 minutes.. If your not in a rush and love a great atmosphere this place is Eggceptional!  For those who are own a strict diet you may choose to order egg whites with wheat bread, that's what i ordered when i was on a diet.. still a great meal! try now! it's located off of green valley parkway and pebble..",

    "text": "We enjoy coming to the cracked egg because we live very close and the food is pretty tasty. The plus side of this place is that the restaurant is clean, cozy and has some friendly staff members (all additional to pretty good food).     The downside is the service is lacking a 5 star rating. The hosts are always behind the counter and to busy to always be paying attention. For a restaurant that gets this busy they really need to hire extra staff. I don't view them as rude, because they're doing the best they can. Its just not top customer service. Its normal to see newbies walk in & not know what to do from lack of a greeting.         The waiters/waitresses are very quick- not to chatty. For some this is a plus, so its really a matter of preference. Personally I enjoy a \"hello, welcome,how are you?\" Type of intro. Especially for first time- menu recommendations, which are always a plus coming from an employee.      The prices seem a bit high to me for what you get. Granted the food is good.. but for a $9-13 omelet I expect a bit more.     I will say their coffee cake is always a hit with us. No matter what the flavor is.       Better than a big time chain breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's but has room to improve. Either way we enjoy eating here.",

My usual is the garden omelette, veggies are always cooked perfectly, never limp, and always the perfect amount of cheese, never overloaded and greasy. The ULTIMATE, is the country fried steak and eggs, like mother's milk to me.  I saw Gary Oldman eating there a few months ago. Surreal. What he was doing in a local eatery in Henderson, I don't know, but it must be a testament to why this place is so damn good! Don't forget to sign up for rewards card.",

I'm always sad because OPH won't scramble me some egg whites and put yummy things like mushrooms and green peppers in them! They claim veggies are for omlettes only.. So imagine my excitement when I see Cracked Egg has scrambled egg whites on the menu! With protein and veggies! They customized my egg whites to be grilled chicken + mushrooms at no extra cost. Egg whites came with delish hashbrowns + amazing soft coffee cake. Fiance got a customizable skillet. Love the options to customize that Cracked Egg has!!   Service sucked or I would give them 5 stars. Waiter brought my eggs without the mushrooms originally (and took a LONG time to bring it back corrected). He never brought the fiance's toast out... ever.   Overall a great alternative to OPH when I'm not feeling pancakes... but maybe their pancakes will be better here too! I'm anxious to try them.",

    "text": "So my husband took me here for a special occasion. It was him, myself, and my 18 month old. I was really excited to try The Cracked Egg as I love trying breakfast places, and I wanted to compare it to some other local places we have been. I wanted to love the experience so much, but I couldn't. I didn't feel that relaxed, comfortable, local feel. As in, the service was below average. I understand places such as here get busy but I worked in the restaurant industry for years so while I can be flexible and understanding I still expect good service. Our server hurried over and asked immediately wanted to order. I asked a couple of questions, we asked recommendations (she did not give us any). I wanted to do a build your own because there were a few extra things I wanted to add to my skillet. She told me just order the corned beef hash skillet off the menu instead of doing build your own (in an annoyed tone) and said it cost less (which it did not, and she said it in an insulting way as if I was trying to jip her or something). I took her recommendation anyways. I love corned beef hash, I order it almost every breakfast place I go but this was not up there compared to some other restaurant's in the areas of quality, taste, and value. I will say the coffee cake was to die for!! I absolutely loved it. The texture, temperature, and flavor was perfect. Our server wasn't seen again the whole meal except to come over and grab our plates (I wasn't done yet) and give us the check. I felt rushed in and out. I just sadly wish our dining experience out on this occasion could have been better. I was disappointed.",

Pros: - Food was awesome, always is. - The muffins are just so soft and when the butter melts on them you instantly want more. -When you have the waiters attention, they are all yours.

    "text": "Still on the hunt for a good burger in an unassuming restaurant, I recently ventured to The Cracked Egg's Henderson location. It's been in my to-do list on my phone for a while now, pulled from some Yelp list that hasn't really brought me any real treats yet. Most people's recommendations and opinions for food are typically below my expectations, but someone has to come through right? Looks like I might have to keep going on that list.  The Cracked Egg is in a typical local strip mall and blends in with everything else from the outside like the rest of our mundane suburban locations. The inside is very open, pretty loud and not that fancy. Some breakfast themed restaurants have a slightly cozier feel than this, but in no means is it uninviting or that bad.  This restaurant is really a breakfast place, and the menu reflects that all the way; you have the full gamut of breakfast choices but I'm sure way better than anything you'd find at an IHOP. The burger options make up a very small section of the menu, with only a few choices that seem like typical offerings for a menu like this.  I went with a mushroom and Swiss burger to once again sample a baseline offering, as they don't really give you the option for a stand-out feature burger. What you're given is a pretty standard looking plate with a good sized burger, pickle wedge, lots of onion, a very large piece of lettuce and some oddly seasoned fries. The seemingly pre-made (not hand-made) patty was thin, yet juicy. It had ok flavor, but wasn't really cooked medium as I had asked. The bun was a bit thin, and made me nervous based on how juicy the burger was, but still held up through to the end. The mushrooms and Swiss both had good flavor and were welcome toppings, whereas my giant hunk of lettuce was a bit much.  As I said before, the fries had an odd seasoning on them I can't quite place. They were just ok, not that fresh and not too crispy. Overall the meal was just ok, depending on how much of a factor you consider the fries to be I don't have too much to complain about, but it just wasn't that great overall. At $8.95 it's not a horrible price, but I've had far better from some other less-than-fancy places lately that were even cheaper. If you're a breakfast lover I'm sure you couldn't go wrong here, but if you're looking for a good cheap burger in Henderson, there are much better places.",

I'm sure they didn't invent the concept, but it's great, fast, and consistent.  The food isn't 'creative' per se, it's exactly as diverse as it needs to be. They have specials that are usually pretty excellent in and of themselves.  The bad: Well, they close at three and they serve jelly in the standard little containers measuring 1/20th of a teaspoon. You need like thirty for one piece of toast.   WTF: GREEN AND BLACK MINTS ARE NOT DELICIOUS. KILL THEM WITH FIRE.  Suggestion: pancakes are an untapped creative medium. Please consider.",
