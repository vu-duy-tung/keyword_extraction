    "text": "Wow. This has instantly become my favorite Filipino restaurant. I first heard about this place a while ago from my coworker. I wish it didn't take me so long to finally go.  Since I'm not in the area much, I figured I'd try as many things as possible. I went with a four-item combo consisting of Mongo, Pinapaitan, Thelma's Special, and Pork Adobo. Of course, I added a small bowl of Sinigang for $1.  The Mongo intrigued me because it's Ilocano style, which I've never tried before. It's less soupy than the Mongo I'm used to. In addition, it's white as opposed to green. But more importantly, it was delicious.  Pinapaitan isn't something that would normally interest me. I don't like bitter dishes and the name screams bitter. Thankfully, the lady told me their version is more mainstream. And I do love tripe. The end result is very good, but I can still taste the bitterness obviously.  Thelma's Special is basically lechon with onions and tomatoes. It's pretty hard to screw this up and they certainly don't. Delicious.  As for the Adobo, this was the one thing I ordered that is probably the most ordinary. The large chunks of pork didn't really look like they would be tender, but they indeed were, surprisingly.  Make sure you check in before you order so that you get your 10% off. I actually forgot, but then when I mentioned it to the lady, she was totally willing to redo my ticket and give me the 10% off. I saved a whole 95 cents! It pays to pay with cash sometimes.",

As expected the food was high in salt but this was more salt than needed for the cooking.  The menu selection was ok nothing great.  The duck wasn't very good. The lumpia seemed like the frozen kind you just heat up.  Disappointed.",

Their lechon kawali isn't like Julie'z though...just as good, but different.  This restaurant is right near the Sunset Station Casino.  Sometimes it's nice to get away from all the buffets and glitzy restaurants of The Strip so when those times come we like to go here.  Comfort food that reminds me of home.  The food here is as good as it gets for Filipino cuisine.  The best deal in the house has to be their 4 item mix combo though.  You get a wide selection and the portions are decent for the price you pay (around $9).  I especially like the way they cook their dinuguan, pancit, and the broth for the oxtail soup.  The food here is delicious, the customer service is friendly, and the restaurant is roomy.  Great place for something different.",

Also, if you're from Hawaii, this place is owned and ran by their daughter so YES, the food tastes exactly the same as the restaurant in Hawaii.

The lechon and bangus plates I have had during my other visits are definitely good as far as Filipino food goes - but it just doesn't blow me away as the hype seems to suggest.   It is not a \"turo-turo\" style Filipino spot where you typically have the food ready made but its not a traditional restaurant spot where you get seated and a server comes to take your order.  Its like a combo spot - you have to get in line to order and then they take it to your table to eat.  I would liken it to a Smash Burger ordering and eating experience - or \"fast casual\" as they call it in F&B.   All in all, decent and I would come again if I was in the area.",

Overall, a very POOR experience. If the cashier lady didn't rush me & was more flexible with the menu, I would have given this place 3 stars.

So my expectatios are really high. Restaurant Filipino food tends to be on the bland side to cater to everyone. I'm used to all the fatty, salty, greasy deliciousness.   My family lives in California so I don't get to eat as much Filipino food as I would like to. However, the craving can get overwhelming at times. So where do I go?!?! Here!!!  This is the closest it gets to Filipino home cooking. Everything I've eaten always comes out piping hot and fresh. Everything is flavored correctly. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. My favorites are kare kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in a peanut butter broth served with shrimp paste) and Thelma's special (pieces of lechon with tomatoes and onions served with special sauce). All sounds off if you aren't used to it, but trust me it is delicious. Only reason why I docked a star is because this isn't my mom's cooking, but it satisfies the need.",

As I sat here and mixed my halo halo together I noticed that it consisted of nothing but ice, milk and a teaspoon full of beans and jelly. Talk about stingy. The Toron was ok. I wish I would of just driven to jollybee I swear it would of been worth their 5$ halo halo instead of this 5.99 halo halo that was probably the best ice and milk combo \"Filipino\" restaurant.",

Super busy everyday, but the services and the foods came fast! So many customers came, most of them older, which is the sign that this place is run well and have great reviews!  I ordered pampano sinigang, it was AWESOME!!! This is my new spot for sinigang resto! they served with a big bowl, if you are eat small portion, this portion is enough for two.  The mixed plate, you can choose 4 side dish and only $9.99 or less if you choose 3,2, or 1 side dish. I was so wanna try everything, so I tried 4 side dish, Man, that was A LOT, at least for me!   I love how they make Dinuguan which was little bit salty on my taste but still acceptable.  Thelma's special - This is a should try dish. I loved it! The flavor was perfect for me!  Adobo Chicken - Very nice soft meat yet enough salt flavor if you eat it with rice.  Pancit mix - This one, surprisingly, the taste was fine, almost bland. But no worries, coz they have shiracha and soy on the table near cashier :).  Overall, I would love to go back to try something else! Very recommended it!",

    "text": "HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #5  What started on a whim last week has resulted in the 5th day in a row of halo-halo for Mel C. and I.  Tonight we brought the challenge to the other side of town and invited a couple of Henderson Yelpers and the Asian Persuasion family to join us.  Shirley B is the duchess of Thelma's, a spacious restaurant near Sunset Station.  First tip:  use your Yelp app to check-in and get 10% off your order.  Ian A. checked in after he ordered and paid and missed out on the discount--sayang!  Next time, na lang.    There are two halo-halo versions here:  the plain one for $5.25 and the special one for $5.75, which includes macapuno and ube ice cream.  We had the special version and the ingredients were: pinipig (first time in 5 tries.  These are toasted rice grains--think Rice Krispies) macapuno (coconut strips) ube ice cream kaong (sugar palm fruit) nata de coco (coconut jelly) langka (jackfruit) cherries **See, we are learning the real names of the ingredients as we go along, instead of saying \"those red stringy things,\" and \" these green balls (!).\"  Yes, Mel and I are both the kind of Filipinos whose parents didn't really teach us Tagalog growing up stateside so we've had to learn as we go.  BUT, I can understand a lot, especially when you're not saying nice things  ;)  What was missing: ube leche flan red beans (azuki)  Everyone's halo-halo preferences are different, so we're just doing the leg work for you and letting you know what we find along the way.  I am still on the hunt for the halo-halo that has ube, leche flan, red beans, langka, kaong, nata de coco, macapuno, and ice cream in ONE bowl.  The search continues.

A lot of the other Filipino places in the area tend to be incredibly oily, but I found Thelma's to be a little less greasy. They have a pretty well priced lunch special that comes with rice, an entree, a drink and fruit salad. The fruit salad isn't anything special. I ordered the pinapaitan lunch special since I was craving some warm soup! I wasn't too impressed as it was a little bland and not hot enough. I did have some of my friend's sisig and would definitely come back for that. I'd say this place is hit or miss, but can definitely satisfy a craving for Filipino food if you choose the right menu items.",

    "text": "This past Tuesday, I was feeling adventurous in dining. I wanted to try someplace new. I set out for a dining adventure at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant. What really made this adventurous dining is that this was my first meal in a Filipino Restaurant. My real-life and Yelp friend Shirley. B would be my adventure guide in my very first dining experience in a Filipino restaurant. In similar style to a first-rate adventure guide, Shirley. B did some research on the food that I appreciate. She concluded that I have reviewed plenty of Chinese restaurants. Consequently,she matched three of the four items with an entree and appetizers that I have ordered in Chinese restaurants. We shared a plate of pancit mix (similar to chow mien noodles), beef vegetable lumpias (similar to egg rolls), garlic fried rice, and BBQ pork on sticks. Thelma's makes sharing easy. They provided serving spoons and extra plates to share the food. This eliminated the worry about germs that many diners have. Thelma also made the pace of dining relaxed by bringing out the different items separately. My favorite item was the pancit mix. If I wasn't dining here with Shirley. B, from looking at the pictures that yelpers posted, the pancit mix and the garlic fried rice would have been the dishes I ordered. Although, pancit mix is a different entree than noodle style chow mien,it was just as delicious. Anchoring each side of the plate was a lemon, that I did not need to squeeze to add flavor to the noodles. What can I really say about garlic fried rice besides it tasting similar to white rice with a garlic flavor? The lumpias tasted similar to the delectable egg rolls that are my usual appetizer before the entree. Finally, the BBQ pork sticks tasted similar to the BBQ food that I have enjoyed in L&L BBQ. I tasted the quality in each bite of the meat that was more taste than messiness. Complimenting the food was bottomless cola.     The trail-head for this dining adventure is a restaurant located in a small strip mall in the shadow of the colossal Sunset Station Casino & Hotel. It is off Sunset Road just west of the Marks Street traffic signal and Gold Rush Casino. Thelma's faces the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. The inside of Thelma's looks more similar to L&L BBQ than an elegant restaurant. The elegance is the deliciousness of the food. To kick off this dining adventure, there are menus along a partition separating the cue from the kitchen. It is in a spot where nobody is watching over you, and you can take your time. The adventure initiates when you order your food and pay. If you are drinking a soft drink, they hand you a cup that you serve yourself. Ultimately they deliver the food for your dining adventure.     In my opinion yelping is about being an adventurist in dining that tries new places, then shares them through reviewing. Its very similar to the concept of living life as an adventure. In my pursuit of living life as an adventure I will occasionally step out of my comfort zone by trying cuisines and restaurants that I never experienced, then ultimately sharing  these experiences. With that said, \"Thank you Shirley. B for being a fantastic guide in adventurous dining.\"",

Well, I finally got to try the food here and I liked it a lot. I'm not too familiar with Filipino food so I ordered what I would usually order at other Filipino restaurants. I got the mix plate with chicken adobo, pancit mix, and Thelma's Special (lechon w/diced tomatoes and diced onions). I thought everything tasted great and I got full. The chicken adobo was so tender and the sauce made it even better. It was my first time trying lechon  and I thought it was good but I didn't like that it was covered in a lot of onions. I ended up picking out the onions.   The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice! I will definitely return and next time around, I'll try something different.",

I grew up on this food and still think dad's cooking is 2nd to none.  I'm also from San Diego and lived 15 minutes from National City.  If you know National City, you know that's there's Tita's Kitchenette, Zarlito's, and Point Point Joint.  All tough acts to follow.    I still give this place 4 stars for the clean restaurant, great service, selection, and decent food. Out of everything I've tried here, I have to say that their Adobo Fried Rice is very good.    Sometimes service takes awhile and sometimes it's quick.  Located on the opposite end from where I live so its tough to even find the energy to drive out here for their food.  But if I'm in the area and in the mood for their Adobo Fried Rice, I will definitely make a stop.  Wish List:  Too bad they don't have Chicken BBQ on a stick.  One of those things I miss and have yet to find a good one out here.",

    "text": "My favorite Ilocano restaurant Elenas is no longer open for business in Las Vegas :(. If me or my guy is craving tasty Ilocano Filipino food this is the only place in Las Vegas that has it. Which is why we come, it's either here or Hawaii and it's not too easy to get there. Hopefully soon enough we can finally move back to the 808 state and enjoy some legit Ilocano style Filipino food. That's another story so let's get to review about Thelma's.   Basically I have to settle for this food because all the other Filipino places are mostly Tagalog which is a different dialect, different style of cooking. We've been here to Thelma's several times but this last visit wasn't as good as our previous visits. The lechon  special was not fresh. You could tell it was cooked before and tasted old. The tapa was tough and kind of boring. The shoyu chicken is pretty good, pancit is pretty good too. Adobo is good but not as good as mine so I can just cook that at home. They have a soup here which is why I came today because I wasn't feeling so well. Chicken soup with long rice which is a clear noodle. Chicken broth flavored slightly with fish sauce cooked with ginger. I asked for bok choy to be added because I like vegetables. It was perfect. So comforting especially when you're not feeling well like I was or in the winter. Anytime really. I usually make at home but not in the mood when I'm sick. Overall Thelma's is a good option for Filipino if you prefer Ilocano style. Hopefully the lechon is more fresh next time because we don't eat it a lot and we do enjoy it.",

    "text": "Filipino food how are you not better known and worshiped? Oh that's right, 99% of the time these are just simple dishes, made with love and care at home. I was first introduced to Filipino fare in San Francisco. Then it was good but very greasy, Thelma was nothing like the dishes I remembered. It's funny because the flavor and textures remind me if very trendy and at times very expensive cuisine. Take for example their lechon. If you are a fan or pork belly, this dish is heaven. Seriously, so good you know it's bad for you. Another example is their chicken adobo. So tender it's braised until it's falling off the bone. The squid guisado, is braised until tender and has some serious deep sea flavor. If you are a fan of the whole snout to tail movement, once again they have you covered. We have tripe, ox tail, hoof, the offal options are varied and done right. The staff is so kind and patient. They happily make recommendations and explain anything that may spark your interest. Prices are ridiculously good, and portions, well let's just say good luck. If you have never had the privilege of experiencing this cuisine Thelma's is the best place to introduce you to it.",

    "text": "Stopped by on Saturday after Thanksgiving, we had been to see the Roger Waters show of \"The Wall\" and were hungry.  We met Lor, one of the daughters of Thelma, and a more gracious host you could not ask for.  We all ordered our favs from the Menu and Lor and company suggested some things and we took their advice.  All was so yummy.  Sunday was time to head back to the Bay Area and we decided to stop at Thelma's again because we were so happy with our choices the day before.  We also decided not to order the same items again even though we were happy with them.  This time Lor was at the order desk and this time we ordered more items off of the item, so here is what we ordered and loved.  Dinuguan (Angelo says this is so yummy, me I cannot get passed Chocolate Meat), Pork Adobo ( I say this is the best ever, and could only get better if they added a hard boiled Quail egg), Pancit Bihon so good I had to steal some.  Lumpia Shanghai was fried just right!  Not too greasy, not underdone, I loved it but more importantly my 8YO Niece loved them more, so much that she ate most of them with out asking if it would be ok, once she did, there were no more left.  I had to order two more orders.  All of the *-silog dishes were so dang good, I even had them make a Spam-Si-Log  as I am a big fan of the canned meat.  Crispy Spam, with garlic rice, tomatoes, and I am a happy man.  But I have said that before.  Add to this that they carry Manny Pacquiao articles and have become a new distributors of MP stuff means that if you wanna get your Pinoy on, near Vegas, this is the place to do it!  I love this place and give it 6 stars, 6 hearts, 6 whatevers, this is the place!  Aloha,  Dave  Oh, and the Halo Halo is so yummy!",

    "text": "Finally had lechon...for a southern girl this is one of those must try dishes that I just learned about fairly recently...and have been trying to figure out when and where to have it...   Don't get me wrong with 3 star review...the place was super clean, large, pretty empty when we arrived and everything felt made to order, which was surprising since it's counter service.    For all you wondering what I mean and if this is worthy of your attention...we are talking pork belly, simply seasoned, cooked somehow so that the skin is uber crispy think shingle and the meat/fat is tender and simply porky...it comes with slivered and soaked whit onion and a sticky sweet dipping sauce that was oddly addictive yet unidentifiable to both my husband and me.    I have a strange love for Hawaiian Mac salad...don't ask me why because I find most, including pseudo Italian pasta salads revulsive...this was just ok.    The \"mini\" chicken adobo fried rice we ordered was actually pork... No complaints tho because it was tasty but what my husband and I both craved with these fat heavy dishes was acidity...crisp, clean, palate cleansing flavors that would lighten each dish and make it sing...   Lime, lemon?  Not sure...  But this is definitely a cuisine/culture worthy of exploration...its rich history due to the influences imposed upon its people and the large number of Filipinos here in LV, give us a unique opportunity for exploration and experimentation.",

Once the navigational says \"destination\" turn into the parking lot and drive around the lot.  It has  a large dining area but we were the only ones there at 1:00pm a few to go orders came in and out as we dined in. You walk up to a counter and order and your food is delivered to your table of choice.  We both ordered the  lunch special two items with rice. I wanted to order something I've never ordered before so I had the adobo fried rice, Panapaitan (a sour soupy stew) and Thelma's lechon kewali crispy pork  with onions and tomatoes. It was all very delicious except for the rice.  Cheap too, under $10.00 for lunch plate and a drink.  Service was excellent the girl who took our order also delivered our food was very friendly.  She told us this was an off shoot of Thelma's in Hawaii.  A little aloha in Las Vegas.  Check it out",

    "text": "Thelma's is a pretty decent restaurant.  While the food was good, it still wasn't amazing or anything special at all.  And since I am Filipino, I have high standards for my motherland's food.  Their lechon kawali was pretty good.  It was crunchy and not crazy oily.  There was a good fat to meat ratio as well.  They had the standard mang tomas sauce to go with the dish, which is very much essential.  I also tried their pinapaitan too, which is a gingery stew, with tripe and beef/liver.  Again, it was good, but not great.  Their chicken adobo was ok. But, I am very particular with this dish, and so it has to have the right amount of soy sauce, vinegar, whole ground black peppers and perhaps maybe even coconut milk with a bay leaf thrown in, so I am of course biased.  I also tried the Thelma's special, which is just lechon with minced onions and tomatoes on top.  My visit to this place ended with the halo halo special, which could have been a bit sweeter. It was also lacking more toppings.  Oh, and their water had no taste, which is good, seriously.  Don't you dislike the taste of tap?  The staff there was very friendly, I must say.  I went an hour before closing and there weren't a lot of people.  Finally, I would say that if you are in the mood for some decent Filipino food, check this place out.  You may satisfy your tummy, but you probably won't be wowed.  However, one thing to keep in mind is that Thelma's is still better than some other Filipino restaurants in town which have their food drowned and soaked in oil.",

    "text": "So I finally made it to Thelma's this weekend with my hubby. Glad I called for directions as it was in a hidden location on Marks/Sunset. I couldn't believe they had been opened since March 2010 as I never knew they were around (and I'm pretty good at knowing where the Filipino joints are...as there's not too many of them in Las Vegas, let alone Henderson)   As we got outta the parking lot, we were greeted by the Cashier as she happened to be outside. As we walked in we were happy to finally see a big dining room as most Filipino restaurants are much smaller. It was clean and quiet...but may have been due to the fact that there was only two tables occupied by two families. The staff offered to help my hubby (I'm guessing since he's Caucasian) choose a dish; however little do they know that he knows Filipino food and can even cook it. But it was a nice gesture to say the least. Now onto our meal:   Thelma's special: this was deep fried lechon kawali chopped up in small cubes served with tomatoes and onions on top. My issue with this is that it's served with a very bland sweet brown sauce. When we poured vinegar on it, it tasted much better and gave it that kick it needed. I only wish that we had some chopped jalapenos to add heat to it.   Beef Steak and onions: This dish is one of my hubby's faves; however he absolutely hated this dish as it had a sweet sauce base. The ones we've had in the past is usually cooked in garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar (similar to adobo) but this had a Hawaiian flare to it. We later found out that Thelma's is more of a Hawaiian/Filipino restaurant which originated in Hawaii.   Pork Adobo Fried Rice with scrambled egg on top: Now this was the best I've ever had! There were shredded pork mixed in and the rice was fried just right. I could have eaten this alone. My hubby and I wiped this plate clean.   Although my hubby will most likely not come back to this place, if I'm in the area, I will definitely go back for more Pork Adobo Fried rice.",

Sinigang Soup and Veggies Only: Filipino Sour Soup/Stew was a nice to sip on between bites of meat and rice.

Although, it wasn't my type (I've had Many versions of Sinigang, I like more sourness)  it was still heart warming and the chunks of tomaotes and green beans felt healthy compared to everything else I was having!  Damn Close and Comparable to My Mother's and Family members Cooking!!! Reasonable Value, Corteous and Polite Staff and Clean dining space makes me a Fan For Sure!!!",

    "text": "When my boyfriend and I arrived to this cute little bistro, there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied. The walls of the interior are painted a light green color that I enjoyed. There are gold statuettes along the walls, as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light. On most, if not all, of the tables are little vases with orchids. It was a pleasant dining area even with the TV playing in the background. It can be hard to spot if you don't pull into the parking area behind Aloha kitchen.   The menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties. J quickly decided on the lechon kawali, a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy, fatty meat on the inside. It came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion. It was REALLY crisp, crackled when you bite into kind of crisp. I found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3-4 pieces- but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat. I ordered the adobo, which was a large bowl full of super tender, soy and vinegar-spiced pork chunks. The cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas I've had, with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel. The flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would've disappeared easily. It seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time, a signature of many comforting dishes. I would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness, but it was a delicious dish. The texture of the rice was great with the pork. We also got an order of the Shanghai lumpia, which would have all vanished if I hadn't caught J before he got to them all! Crisp, narrow cigar-shaped little pockets of deep-fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce, it's easy to see why.   We also had an Ilikoi passion drink and Kona coffee. The coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non-dairy creamer, which saddens me a little. It's really a small detail, but when having such a nice variety of coffee I want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose/hydrogenated processed things. Not a huge deal because it still tasted great, but something I find worth pointing out. I was really excited that they offered kona coffee! The passion fruit drink was also tasty, though J drank most of it. The water tasted like tap water, so we barely sipped any.  Overall, the food here was great. If you're a fan of the Hawaiian Sun drinks I imagine you'll be happy. It's a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and I'd rather go here than to another McChipotle or Pei Wei. Not my usual neighborhood hang out, but I can see going back sooner rather than later!",

You walk in and go to a counter to order your food. I told the person at the counter that I had never had Filipino food and he was very helpful with his suggestions. I got the adobo chicken and pork. The wife and kids got some kind of sweet chicken. All I know is that when the food is brought to the table the smells are wonderful. I can honestly say the chicken was the best I ever had. It was super flavorful and moist. Everyone had a great meal, and my daughter has already asked if we can go back. If your near this place stop in. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have been exposed to the Filipino culture from my days as a small child. The families I have been around have always been so welcoming, and the food has always been phenomenal. Needless to say, I was expecting this same type of experience at Thelma's.   My family and I ate lunch there a few days ago, and were a little shocked at the lack of customer service we received.  I get it; this place is not your typical set up. You need to order your food at the counter and then seat yourself.  Someone will then drop your food off at your table and will never check on you again. However, I noticed that other customers inside the restaurant were receiving more attention than we were. I only know some cuss words in Tagalog, so I couldn't follow the conversations. Don't get me wrong, they staff didn't mistreat us, nor were they rude in any way. We were basically ignored. For example, after our meal I went up to order the Coco-nana dessert. When the lady brought us our dessert, she didn't even grab our dirty dishes off of the table as she was heading back to the kitchen. I pre-tipped her when I paid for my bill, and felt that was the least she could have done. It's not like they were garbage cans around so I could clear my own table. I was less than satisfied from a customer service standpoint, but the food was good.  For an appetizer, we decided on the Shanghai lumpia. These were close to perfect, and were accompanied by a sweet chili dipping sauce. My only complaint was that there were only 6 in the order. I could eat 2 dozen of these by myself-they are so addicting. For our entree, we decided on the chicken adobo. Good--but I have had better. Specifically, the adobo lacked seasoning and came across as a little bland. The pancit was delicious! However, my favorite part of this meal was the previously mentioned coco-nana dessert. Warm banana bread with a scoop of coconut ice cream over the top was the perfect end to our meal.  I didn't even care that I am lactose intolerant.   I really like this place and am thankful that there is authentic Filipino food in Henderson. However, I am disappointed that the Filipino culture  I was familiar with did not coincide with the customer service inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "The spouse is a Filipina, and she tends to be quite critical of Filipino restaurants serving stale or old food.  I have to admit, I have come around to her view on this matter.  Many Filipino restaurants have the food pre-cooked and out for the diner to see and select.  Thelma's food is fresh.  It's served hot and delicious.    So far, we've ate breakfast and dinner at this restaurant.  The breakfast was a large serving of fried rice with spam, bacon, and sausage mixed in.  It also had an egg, cooked to order.  The cost of the breakfast was about $5.00.  They also made fresh Kona coffee for $1.50, with delicious creamers and sweetners.    For dinner, we had Sinigang Pamapo and Thelma's Special.  Thelma's Special was crispy pata with onions and tomatos over the top.  It was delicious.  The chunks of pork were crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  The Sinigang Pampano is a sort of sour tasting soup with vegies and a good sized Pampano cut in three pieces.  I left the sour soup to the wife, and focused on the Pampano...quite fresh and delicious.  The meal came with lots of steamed rice.  I don't think either dish cost more than $9.00.   The banana lumpia was okay, but not exactly my thing when it comes to desert.    The service is attentive.  The value is there.  The place is clean.  You also get to view The Philippino Channel on a Plasma TV.  Make the drive to Henderson, everything here is much better than Goldilocks.",

They also doubled charge me with the rice when, I didn't even ordered it.  Oh well, At least I gave it a try, 2 times.  I don't think I'm going back there ever again.  Sorry Thelma!",

    "text": "(WARNING: Filipino food can have a strong mixture of sour, vinegary, salty goodness banging up against sweet, crunchy, meaty climaxes of flavor.  If these types of taste are too sexy for your tongue, you may want to eat elsewhere.  Consider yourselves warned.  I'd better not see anyone putting up some negative reviews because they were not prepared.)  Even though I may not look it, I'm half Filipino and grew up with this food.  That being said, I will most likely show a lot of favoritism towards this place.  Its flavors take me back to my childhood and playing with my cousins.  Thelma's is located near the Sunset hotel in the same building as Aloha kitchen.  (Aloha kitchen is known for having the worst teri chicken I have ever had, but great kalbi)  To Find Thema's you need to drive around to the back side of that building.    The inside is simple with a theme leaning towards the tropical and the Filipino channel on the TV set.  The menu may not be the largest, but what they make I love.  Today I went with one of my favorites and something new.  I had the combo with my fav, dinuguan (aka dinardaraan for my Ilocano bothers), and Thelma's special.    Dinuguan is a vinegary tasting pork blood meat.  Being cooked with blood, it comes out looking like stew size chunks of pork in black sauce.   It is rich with flavor and has a lovely grit to it from the blood.  Thema's take on it was True to mom's cooking back home.  However, the sauce was a bit thinner than I like and they seem to have taken out all the fatty bits for the general public's sake.  My mom didn't discriminate, fatty or lean, it went in the pot.  Over all, it was great.  Not as good as moms, but pretty close.  Now Thelma's special is a bit miss leading.  The description says it's lichon kawali cut up and mixed with chopped onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce.  A more accurate description would have been chicharon with chopped onions, tomatoes, and bagoong.  Cause that's what it tasted like and it tasted wonderful.  It made me wish that I got more of it.  For those of you that don't know, lichon Kawali is a whole roasted pig, all crispy and wonderful on the outside.  This dish was salty, oniony, sweet, meaty, and crunchy.  Heavenly.  My mom made the same thing for me when I was younger and this was just as good.  Sorry mom, I must be honest.  The one thing that was a bit difficult was the server that day.  We were having some communication problems, but my order came out right and it came out extremely quick.  That's what matters.  So if you're in the area, bypass Aloha Kitchen and head on over to Thelma's for some good eats.  Did I mention the price was good too?  Because it is!",

Went there for the lunch special. $6.50 for your choice of entree, that comes with rice, mac salad, a drink, and fruit salad for dessert! WOW. I was already impressed when I saw that near the register. I opted for the PInakbet, and my boyfriend got the Thelma's Special. They had ran out of mac salad that day, but the friendly lady at the register offered to give us some mixed pancit in place of it. I was cool with that! So we pay and take our seats, and dabble in the ridiculous game shows that seem to be endlessly playing on Filipino channels... well that and then a drama shortly after!   We get our lunch plates, and they are decently sized! For 6.50 including a drink, I honestly think it's a steal!   I had a taste of my boyfriends Thelma's special and had to restrain my fork from ravaging his plate again! IT IS SO GOOD. I don't know about you guys, but that's the closest \"Lechon Kawali\" that I can get here in Vegas, and ALMOST identical to the dish I remember at my family parties in Hawaii! YUM  My pinakbet was... average, to say the least. The tastes were okay, I was expecting a very soupy dish, with A LOT of soft vegetables, but it was just okay. The eggplant in it had too tough/thick of a skin, and I just think it needed to be cooked a bit longer.  It's okay, we both finished our plates, down to the last rice grain! Then, our waitress came out with our fruit salad! Yay! Although it was a bit sweet for my taste buds, I am glad that it comes with some sort of dessert!  All in all, I would come back to this place to sample their other popular items! Service was great, and the restaurant was clean and inviting. Recommended for a fast, affordable meal.",

We ordered pompano sinigang soup (fish sour soup), Thelma's special Lechon kawali (deep fried pork) with chopped onions and sliced tomatoes, and the recommended adobo fried rice.  The sinigang soup was cooked with lots of chopped tomatoes that the broth turned a little darker. Quite different than the the original recipe but it works, it tasted great!  Pompano fish  was really fresh. Thelma's special Lechon kawali is a seasoned deep fried pork belly (chopped) served with fresh diced onions, and fresh tomatoes lightly seasoned with soy sauce and vinegar.  The pork  and fried skin was equally portioned, meat was tender and seasoned perfectly. This was my favorite and tasted authentic!  The adobo rice was mild to taste and popular. If you say adobo even if mixed and cooked as fried rice, I was expecting a well seasoned, deeper and richer flavor  with a hint of garlic, this Adobo fried  rice was below my expectations. Just needs a little tweaking.  Overall: clean restaurant, You order and they cook it fresh, price is reasonable, and served fast. Pleasant, friendly staff.",

When I came back after about 25 minutes, the cashier/server told me that they have just started working on my orders and it will take another 15 minutes. I was really disappointed because when I put my order in, there were only a few people eating onside the restaurant and when I came back, at least 5 to 6 tables were already full. That means they pushed my orders back. I will not recommend this place and will not  come back again.",

It does take a minute to get your food which is fine because it is sooo worth it. This place serves up local authentic filipino food so if you're ever in the mood head over here.

I'm originally from Hawaii and the fusion between Filipino and Hawaii food are a perfect combination and no one can top it like Thelma's. I got the Thelma's Special which is basically chopped Pork deep fried and and marinated with their special sauce mixed with tomatoes and onions, also ordered a side of their Musubi A lovely addition to starting my day. Try it out for yourself they have tons of other delicious dishes and one of my favorite restaurants.",

I enjoyed the  variety because I can have a little of everything .  I ordered the pancit,  pork adobo and the lechon. The lechon had tomatoes and onions on top. I loved that because it reminded me of when my would make it and we would put it on top of our rice. The pancit was made with the thin crystal noodles just the way I like it. The pork adobo was also tender and flavorful.  It satisfied my craving for my mom's cooking!   My husband on the other hand doesn't eat a lot of ethnic foods so it was hard for him to order. I did some pre research on Yelp for him before we went. They had a banana bread dessert with coconut ice cream that I thought would be good for him but they didn't serve that the day we went. Then he picked halo halo . I explained that they put different things in Halo Halo that he may not like. When the cashier explained the ingredients he passed on that. He ended up ordering the mac salad and garlic rice. Of course I took some off his plate. ( strictly for research purposes lol) They were both delicious! If you are in Henderson and want Filipino food  this is definitely the place to be!!",

We went with Thelma's special which was two scoops of rice and pork deep fried in pieces with onions and diced up tomato. Not impressed with this but more impressed with the four item combo we got which was Pancit, pork gisantes, pork shoyu, and pork adobo with rice. The Pancit was flavorful. Everything was good that I sampled. So delicious. The lumpia Shanghai was good too. My fave was the pork adobo. It was tender and soft. One of the best. Other places leave food under the heat lamps which makes the meat hard. This place makes your food fresh. For dessert, I went with halo halo special which has milk, shaved iced, sweet palms, Jack fruit, ube, and leche flan. I love this dessert and it sure hit the spot. I was full with this. The only issue with me was they give you two small scoops of rice. I love my rice and need it to accompany my main dishes but overall the food was good! My daughter and hubby had coco nana which was banana bread with coconut ice cream on top. I didn't sample this because halo halo was all mine.  Service was great by our waitress. She was also taking orders up front. You can have your food to go or dine in. I enjoyed dining in because they had TFC (The Filipino Channel) on. Very entertaining while you eat. I would definitely come back here to eat Filipino food if I was near the area.",

Not fried too much which is always good and healthy ;p If I didn't have the vinegar, fish would've been just as tasty.  But, let's be honest, I'm a vinegar lover so that BadBoy, along with my rice, was swimming in Binegar **pinay accent**  I neeeeeeeddddddd to go back and order two! Just for me!!!!!

It's a little far of a drive for me but when I'm in the area I'll be sure to fix my Filipino Food craving with this. They're not \"turo-turo\" style unlike most Filipino fast food so their food tastes a little more fresh and like home. It's not too oily and has pretty good flavor.   I ordered to go and waited about 10 mins for my chicken adobo and sinigang soup. For one order of adobo I got 4 large chicken thighs-- I feel like I could've cooked this myself for $5 (in terms of quantity) but alas you do pay for convenience. The sinigang was delicious-- definitely was the base to a fish sinigang.   I think it's one of my better choices for Filipino food here in town.",

Walk up to the counter to order and pay, then find a table, they will bring the food to you.  Not the best Filipino food I ever had, but the best you'll find in Las Vegas that's not homemade.

Plus, their combo plates were a mix of both Filipino and Hawaiian styles which is appealing to me on many levels.  The thing I liked about Thelma's is that I can get breakfast at any time of the day!  They have about 4 or 5 breakfast entrees ready to go whenever the mood strikes.  I am a huge fan of the breakfast-all-day concept and I ultimately ended up going with one of their omelettes.  The omelet itself was pretty standard except that the omelet came with rice instead of hash browns!  It was a nice throwback to my younger days in Hawaii.  They also use Aloha Shoyu (I was surprised that the waitress offered \"Shoyu\" NOT \"Soy Sauce\" :) ) here and anywhere that serves Aloha Shoyu is alright in my book.  Good restaurant but not a lot of vegetarian dishes but I didn't expect anything like that here because I'm pretty positive that there are not a lot of  vegetarian Hawaiians (like myself) or even vegetarian Filipinos out there.  But, I'm sure I will see Thelma's again.. In the meanwhile I hope they get more seafood or veggie dishes to cater to my \"habit\".",

I'm not a big fan of filipino restaurants...the portions tend to be small and the quality of service is not that great...but Thelma's has been the best filipino restaurant I've ever been to. It's simple and casual, but high quality. The food is delicious, and the people are nice and friendly. I've been to the location in Hawaii, and both of them are good, but the service here is better!   The restaurant is deceptively not easy to find, even though it's practically across the street from the Station Casino. It's basically in the back of the shopping plaza, so you don't really see it when you're driving down the street. It has a nice and simple decor on the inside, with a tropical hawaiian-filino theme going on throughout the restaurant. When you enter, you wait in line and place your order and pay, and then they cook the food fresh and bring the food to your table. The menu is posted above the counter, kind of like Jollibees, except the food listed on it is way better. ;) One thing about it is that some of the dishes lack a full description, and because I'm not filipino, I don't know what a lot of it is. However, the friendly staff at the counter is more than happy to help you order. One time I was even offered a sample of the pork guisantes because i wasn't sure if i wanted to order it. It ended up being my most favorite dish at Thelma's!  My favorite dishes are the pork guisantes, which is pork and peas cooked in a tasty seasoned tomato sauce; mongo beans (the BEST mongo i've ever had), which is mung beans cooked with lechon in a rich, but light and flavorful sauce; and of course Thelma's special, which is chunks of lechon (roasted pig) with fresh diced tomatoes and onions in a soy and vinegar sauce.  Everything else I've had there is also quite tasty. That includes the shoyu chicken (chicken braised in soy sauce), kare kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce), adobo (pork or chicken braised in vinegar and soy sauce), pinakbet (mixed vegetables like onions, green beans and bitter melon), and fried rice. ALL OF IT=DELICIOUS!  Great food, good portions, reasonable prices, and excellent customer service makes Thelma's a great filipino restaurant. I believe this is a pretty new location, so definitely check it out!!",

It borders Sunset Station on Sunset Ave - right across from Galleria mall. Ample parking. Lots of seating - great for our party of 8.  And the food - hit the spot! I highly recommend the Thelma's special. Lechon kawali, so delicious!  If you're craving good Filipino food, Thelma's is the place to go!",

    "text": "CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN:  Good Introduction Food for non-Filipinos - cooked well and not heavily seasoned.  THE MEAT: We had a lot of it because that's what hubby craved for.  We had pork adobo fried rice with fried eggs (adobo = anything stewed in garlic, soy sauce and vinegar), a sweetish salty pork sausage (longganisa), deep fried pork belly and the halo-halo special (a crushed ice dessert with beans and purple yam ice cream).  Everything was cooked (prepared) perfectly.  Hubby and I didn't know if it was our allergies acting up, but we found the food a little lacking in taste.  We wanted a little more soy, vinegar and garlic in everything... even more sugar in the halo-halo.  The only sweetness was coming from the ice cream (which you do not get in the regular order).    I'd give this place 3.5 stars for the food, but because the place is large, clean and has awesome service, it merits 4 stars here.  If you were a health buff or a Filipino Food Virgin, definitely go to this joint.  If you're a little more adventurous with a well seasoned palette, you can try DT's Filipino Food.  Don't be fazed by the Chinese decor and the poor ratings on Yelp.  They have a good chef from Pampangga.  I'M STILL DIGESTING... All the grease from my meal.  Hehe.  Filipino food is soaked in fat/oil and is meant to be eaten in hot weather.  So when it is served, eat is fast.  Then exercise a little.  ;)  WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-)  Adobo Rice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#o_b8zRARbqPoDKlC7mXGTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thel...</a> Longganisa <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#NqQc4KgVWN7lYxeii69EpA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thel...</a> Lechon Kawali <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#sKPQeo2eIWVvAf39_hchSQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thel...</a> Halo-Halo <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#lZ7ciIT90t2rnmp_dEytsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thel...</a>",

They offer a wide variety of dishes.  Their dinaguan (dinardaan for the Ilokano but a more liquid version) is excellent.  I was surprised that for their chicken paria, the leaves were available as well as the fruit.  The sari-sari is excellent.  The pinakbet is good especially if you like bitter melon as the dish can be a little on the tart side.  The adobo, chicken and park, are always tasty.  My personal favorite which is the pork and pumpkin, is a home run.   As always, their adobo friend rice omelet is outstanding, as is their roast pork with tomato and patis.  There are many other selections available.",

Alternative was offered because they said the bigger chops of lechon kawali will take a while to cook. (Well we should have been told before we paid.)  The Sinigang na bangus was good. But the \"chopped\" lechon kawali isn't. They weren't crunchy as expected and tasted old, like pork left overs just reheated.  The place seems clean, even the restrooms are surprisingly acceptable compared to other small Filipino joints we've gone to. The staff are courteous.   We might come back if we are in the area. We'll just make sure not to settle for alternatives.",

    "text": "Pancit Palabok was the very first dish I ordered from here.  It's one of my favorite Filipino dishes that I only got to eat when at family parties. Now I can have it anytime here!!! Thelma's version is awesome...rice noodles drenched in the gravy shrimp and pork sauce topped with hard boiled eggs, crumbled chicharon, green onions, sliced lemons, yeah the works! The entree is meant to feed 2+ people, but I ordered just for myself.  Other favorite staples of mine are their Pork Gisantes. The meat is tender from being stewed with bell peppers and tomato based broth. Veggie lumpia another favorite.  Eggrolls are one of the foods the general public is introduced to when trying Filipino cuisine.   I come here for Diniguan too!  The pork is tender and very tasty. I can taste the garlic which I think brings out this dish. Some people are bit put off when you tell them the English translation \"Pork Blood Stew\" and the meat is cooked in the blood juices with garlic and vinegar. It's similar to the blood sausage or British Black pudding. So other than the process or the name of the dish, dont let that stop you from trying it out. Thelma's cooking is about close as to your mom's home style Filipino cooking as you can get.    Must try: Halo Halo Special....Shaved ice topped with mixed fruits, Macapuno (Coconut) & Ube(Purple sweet yam) ice creams...order same time you get your lunch, it takes a while to crank out the shave ice.  Ambiance: Very clean, tables bussed right away. The place is Bright, natural sunlight beams down through all the windows surrounding the restaurant during the day. Maybe that's why it can feel warm even though they have the air conditioner on. For the Tagalog language challenged (ie Me) they have pictures of their different plates and entrees with the description and the menu in English.  Service: Super friendly! Lorene who is usually up in front taking orders is very helpful and knows my husband's order more than I do!  I did an order to go once and ordered fried rice. I totally forgot to mention to leave out certain ingredients from it, but Lorene knew anyways! Thank goodness! So yes the staff here are definitely  rockstars when it comes to service with a smile!",

Can't remember the name of the soup, but it is the vegetable side soup (a few bucks) it is sour and I licked the cup. Amazing flavor and so well balanced. My fish was cooked to perfection and the garlic rice was spot on. I got to talk with Thelma's daughter Loraine (not sure of the spelling), but such a kind person. She clearly loves to cook and takes pride in what is served. I'm from Madison Wisconsin and tonight felt like I was apart of Thelma's dinner table. Just an FYI, the directions took me to the wrong spot. Look at the map and follow the blue dot....thee buildings down from where the directions took me. Can't wait until my next visit.",

If they didnt have a sign in the front of the building, you would never know they were there!   Make sure you check in to get 10 percent off your order.   Just about everything on the menu is dee-lish. I usually get the lechon and pork adobo with steamed rice. I love the fact that they give you a small cup of diced tomatos and onions mixed with soy sauce and vinegar. You gotta have that along with the Mang Tomas sauce for the lechon. It's not lechon without it! Now I don't need to describe it to you if you're a first timer. I would say its a safe bet for your first time. Once you get a taste of these two items, you will come back for more. Of course you gotta eat it with the steamed rice to equalize the flavor. Otherwise, you will complain that it is too salty.  To top it off, you gotta get the Halo-Halo for dessert! Its so good that they named it twice! Good to share but if you are able to finish it by yourself than you better get checked for worms! LOL.   Service is ok. When you have a grip of people in there, don't expect to get your food with a snap of your fingers. They take cash and cards.",

We ordered 2 orders of the Shanghai Lumpia, Chicken Adobo, and Chicken Adobo Fried Rice. I was worried that two orders of the lumpia might be too much since they came with six pieces each. However, when I tried the lumpia, I did not want to share my order. They were deliciously crunchy and the filling was well seasoned and they came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I was anticipating them to be soggy after the 15 minute ride home, but they were still warm and crispy. My boyfriend had the adobo and he said that it was pretty good, but the sauce was too thin. When I tried it, it thought the chicken was a little dry, which also translated into the chicken in the fried rice. The fried rice dish on a whole was pretty good. It was made with short grain rice and green onions. It was tasty and came with two eggs on top. I asked for them over easy, but one of them must have broken and was overdone.   The restaurant was very casual and though our food took a while to come out, it was freshly made. The items added up and the bill ended up higher than I expected. It was a good meal overall and I look forward to trying more Filipino food.",

We received six ingredients- ice, two of the tiniest scoops of ube ice cream, condensed milk, some red jello, kaong, and macapuno.   No mungo, corn, leche flan, and other usual things. This is the special. I wonder if their usual halo halo only would have ice and milk.  Seriously, don't be so cheap. People, do not go and support a restaurant where it took them 15 mins to make this dessert. This is a total ripoff. Never again.",

    "text": "Food:  Thelma's Special, Pancit Palabok, Lumpia Shanghai, \"Coco nana\".  Thema's Filipino Restaurant has been a longstanding little restaurant which I've had the pleasure to eat at quite a few times when it first opened up.  Since moving away from that side of town, it has been awhile, but it so happened that we were in the area this week.  To put simply, it no longer remains up to par from what it used to be.  Upon taking our seats, three different high chairs had to be brought in as the first two had broken seat belts for our baby.  Our food came fairly quickly but not hot at all.  Thelma's special consists of fried pork belly, mixed with fresh diced tomatoes and onions.  The lechon (pork belly) just wasn't up to par as other more recently opened Filipino restaurants in Nevada, and the portions of meat were considerably smaller than before.    Their version of pancit palabok just wasn't special, either.  The taste was very bland and dish came hardly warm.  We didn't even finish the plate and our leftovers sat in the fridge until thrown away.  That usually doesn't happen with Filipino food.  To end the night with dessert, I ordered their \"coco-nana\".  Coconut ice cream on banana nut bread.    Only when the dessert came out, they had purple Taro ice cream instead.  Our server stated they ran out of coconut ice cream.  If that were the case, why not ask the customer first if a substitution was okay or not?  Between our water cups never being refilled and this, a sadly disappointing experience both food and service-wise.    Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 20/100",

If it doesn't taste like your Nana's or Lola's cooking then these restaurants ain't doing it right... lol anyways, first impression was that the area is spacious, there are a lot of tables to accommodate rushes. You ended the door and start standing in line to the right side of the store where there are menus posted up close. Once you know what you want you'll see an order here sign to the left where you just order and pay then sit at a table of your choice. From there they will deliver the food out to you. They offer water cups and their water is mixed with lemons, which makes it even better.   I waited for 10 minutes before my food came out. The following prices were roughly: Thelma's Special (Pork Kawali with2 scoop Rice) $11 Mini Adobo Fried Rice $6 3 Choice Plate $11  First impression was the portioning is okay, it's on the small average side but it got my fiance and I full. On top of their trash bins there are a variety of sauces such as soy sauce, vinegar, tobasco, etc. The cashier/ server lady was nice too. She checked up on us even when we sat at a table that was super far. The only thing I didn't like was the cleanliness. The chairs still had crumbs from previous customers and the table was sticky.",

I'm from Hawaii, I know my filipino food, and I used to eat at The Thelma's in Waipahu.  Yes, at least once a week I'd pick up food for my co-workers.     I was in Vegas so I decided to stop by for a quick dinner.  I was excited because I haven't had Thelma's in years regardless that I go to Hawaii quite often.    Food:  I ordered the Thelma's special and Pork Sinigang.  The Thelma's special was far from what I remembered and very soggy.  :(  The pork sinigang lacked the sour flavor and had too much ginger taste.  I mean TOO much! :(   Tupac ordered the Bangus Sarciado and the cashier heard shrimp sarciado instead.  He told her I did not order that and I confirmed it too that he said bangus and she said no.  Whatever, Tupac was hungry and said he'll just eat it. I was like NO they should make what you ordered.  Oh well.  :(    Overall, the restaurant is clean. It's unfortunate though that I know how good the dishes are since I've been eating at the Waipahu location for years.  This Thelma's disappointed me and I know it was probably the different cooks.",

Out of all the Filipino restaurants I've been to, this place has the smallest serving. Pinakbet was basically boiled veggies with fish sauce, lacked flavor. Dinuguan wasn't flavorful either... I usually taste vinegar but this had none. Whomp.  I also tried my friends sides as well, squid and the special which had lechon, tomatoes and onion. Nothing special.   Also order the lechon kawali musubi and I rather just stick to the regular musubi with spam.  Nothing special about this place and the food wasn't that great. Nothing really stood out to me. When you're really hungry, the food you eat usually satisfy you... But I wasn't happy when I left, I wish I went across the street to famous daves or something that would've satisfy my hunger.",

    "text": "Lots of tasty looking menu items had me indecisive. My husband and I finally decided on two things: The Sisig and the Adobo Loco Moco  The sisig was delicious. Crisp pieces of pork seasoned well and full of flavor. The portion was a normal size, but the overall taste of it had us wanting more.   The adobo loco moco was okay ($8.25). Since I'm an adobo fan and also a loco moco fan, the combination of both sounded heavenly. I went further and paid the extra amount to add adobo fried rice as a substitution for the white rice. Do not do this -- my rice was drenched in adobo sauce. No white at all. Because of this, I wasn't able to tame down the saltiness of the adobo taste. I couldn't even taste my egg. Next time, I'll definitely keep the white rice option for balance. Still was good, but would definitely be better if ordered as is (adobo loco moco with white rice)...that's unless you love soupy adobo flavored rice  Additional pros: Lots of seating. Friendly customer service. Many menu options. Check-in for 10% off your meal",

    "text": "Most Filipino restaurants are buffet or turo turo style, which works well for the target market of cost conscious Filipinos. However, that leads to mediocre food. That's where Thelma's comes into play. The best Filipino food in Vegas, period.  Thelma's is a casual sit down Filipino restaurant where you order at the counter and food is later brought out to you. It has most of the Filipino standards, as well as a few Hawaiian dishes with a Filipino twist. At my most recent visit, I had the Adobo Loco Moco. The adobo broth had a great balance of soy sauce to vinegar and was delicious. Every other dish I've had here has been on point.  The dining area is clean and it looks like a legitimate establishment. There are some Filipino restaurants that I would hesitate bringing a non-Filipino friend to, but not here. Thelma's isn't groundbreaking with its decor, but it's a place that won't have you worrying about health code violations.  Prices are a tad more than what you'd pay at a buffet or turo turo style Filipino restaurant, but it is still a solid value and is more than made up for by the increased food quality.",

Even that is rare. I'd say the only time I eat Filipino food is during the holidays.  How ironic. Thelma's is in Vegas and I LOVE their Thelma's Special. It is so tasty and artery clogging but totally worth it. We went there to order a snack of fried rice for my nephew and dad and to put in our order for catering on Christmas Eve. Like I said their Thelma's Special is awesome! Other dishes we ordered were the pumpkin with pork, pork guisantes, and adobo fried rice. Everything was so good. My other favorite aside from the crispy pork is the adobo fried rice. Mmm!   Their prices are pretty reasonable too. The girls that work in the restaurant are super friendly and helpful. After leaving that restaurant all that was playing through my head was that \"Filipino Foods\" song.",

    "text": "I really don't like Filipino food, and this started when me and my older brother went to visit our grandparents on Lanai for the entire summer, and because of that we took our pet dog with us.   The island of Lanai has a very large Filipino population, and my brother made me dislike Filipino food at a very young age by telling me that a Filipino family got my dog, and ate him when he went missing.  Since then, I avoid it like the plague, and even thought I'm proud to be part Filipino, I still won't touch the stuff at all;  BUT....one day, I had to take my Mom and a few of her friends to eat here, and had no choice in the matter but hangout with  them.  I reluctantly looked at the menu, and gave into the Fried Rice special.    Guess what, I actually liked it.   I have to admit, the meats (Portuguese sausage, spam, smoke meats)  were pretty big cuts, and was abundant throughout the rice mixture.   The only fallback, they should have added more Oyster sauce, but I just asked them for a small cup on the side, and it turned out great.  This place is kind of hard to find, but it's located behind Vitamin Shoppe.   I heard one great thing about this restaurant...anytime Manny Pacquiao is in Las Vegas, he will visit this place at least once for breakfast.    Looks like I'm going to have a few fried rice in the next few months.  As for my dog, he came back home after a few weeks, and a few months later we heard that Lanai had a rather large population of part Dachshund puppies around the city being given away.",

On my first visit, I was ordered Kare Kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce) and Thelma's special. I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \"special\" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.  The next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient.   The restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!",

Calling ahead for a to go order is best cause the wait can be sometimes lengthy. The atmosphere is average, overall pretty clean and quaint. Definitely a place to check out if you craving some good Filipino food.",

If you feel stuffed after a big meal, go to either Sunset Station Casino or the Galleria Mall to walk it off!  =)  To Roger T., thanks for the advice!

There was a full restaurant and only about 3 people working. We waited almost 1 hour for our food. Not to mention they mixed up other tables food. Meaning they sat the wrong persons food on our table and left. We had to flag them down and tell them it wasn't our food. Then they brought it to the other table, who refused it because it had been sat down in front of us. Food was solid but the waiting with our daughters in the heat with a lousy ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. Tried to tell the owners husband that we liked the food, but that it was too hot, he brushed us off and said it was his wife's restaurant. Yeah and you are in here working, so you should give a flip, right?! That blew us outta of the water, and unfortunately we will find some other good Filipino food.",

    "text": "After looking around the Galleria Mall, I stopped by Thelma's Filipino Restaurant to get a hearty meal.. and a hearty delicious meal is what I received. Location is right across the street from the mall itself and nearby Sunset Station casino. I missed my friend's Father cooking homemade Chicken Adobo and Pork Gisantes.. oh the aroma that filled the room as he cooked these dishes. I woke up to this every time I slept over at her place. One of many reasons why I loved spending a night there :P So sometimes I have cravings for something sour, sweet, and tangy all in one visit. This place is just what I needed.   I loved the dining area... so spacious and clean. The light green colored walls and wooden chairs gave this place such an cool, soft ambiance... I couldn't help but think I was in Hawaii or somewhere tropical. I enjoyed sitting by the window and having the sun rest on my face. Nice to look out and enjoy a beautiful day!!!  I ordered a mixed plate of the choice of two.... I chose the one scoop of rice and mac salad with two entrees of the Pork Gisantes and Chicken Adobo. When the plate arrived, it had a wonderful fragrant, color, and looked so tasty!!! It was one huge chicken piece for the Chicken Adobo and the meat was so tender that you wouldn't even need a knife to cut it. All I had to do was peel the meat off with my fork. Juicy and a burst of flavor... it had a small acidic bite, but the sauce was so delicious with rice. The Pork Gisantes had chunks of meat, green peas and green bell peppers. The meat had a few chunks of fat too, but it contributes to the flavor of the dish, so I didn't mind at all. The sauces from both dishes were wonderful to taste...  It was a combination of sweetness and sour. I asked for the condiments and added some vinegar/garlic sauce to the Pork Gisantes, because I like to go a little extreme on the sour side. Maybe too much..  where you coat your whole tongue full of vinegar!!! I love it!   After I finished everything... I always loved the Filipino dessert... Halo Halo! So I ordered their Halo Halo Special that came with Macapuno Ube(Young Coconut Purple Yam) ice cream! YUM. They serve it to you in a glass bowl with two scoops of ice cream and a piece of leche flan on top of crushed ice. Underneath the ice is where all the goodies are placed. Sugar palm fruit, jackfruit, nata de coco (chewy, jelly-like), and sweet beans are all mixed together to enjoy. It's topped off with some toasted crushed young rice and it's a wonderful treat to have after a tangy, hearty meal. And also you can sip it like a drink when you ate everything and all the ice has melted. So delicious and revitalizing to the senses!!!   Service was very friendly and helpful. Although I don't eat much Filipino cuisine, I do love it every time I come here. Brings back good old memories and flavors I missed during my childhood. Their chicken adobo was very close in how my friend's father used to make it. Tantalizing aromas and flavorful dishes awaits for you at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant.",

    "text": "I paid a visit, my first visit, to Thelma's last night for dinner. I had a craving for adobo fried rice and a friend recommended Thelma's as an authentic option. When I looked at the menu I saw they offer smaller portions and musubi as sell. I'm sold. I ordered a mini pork adobo fried rice topped with a scrambled egg and a longanisa sausage musubi. It came to the same price as the larger portion fried rice would have been.  I sat in wait for a little while waiting for my order to be filled. It was not terribly busy in there. One lady in front of me and somebody picking up an order he placed earlier. It seems to me the food, then, is made fresh to order. It wasn't too long really and I had my food headed out the door.  I like musubi fresh and hot so I ate that in the car before even leaving the parking lot. Rice and nori are standard. The sausage made it different than the Spam musubi I am used too. The sausage was good. A little tough. Salty. Oily. Lightly sweet. It would make a great breakfast bite. But I think I'll stick with the tried and True Spam musubi that I love so very much.  When I got home I dug into the rice. For the atmosphere I ate in the dark. Actually my power went out and lights were not an option. Regardless, I got to enjoy what looked like a smaller portion than I expected from a mini order. But there ended up being more in there than my eyes could behold in the dark. I was full when I finished. Most importantly, it was good. Really good. A lot of tender pork. Perfectly cooked rice. A load of adobo flavors. Even the egg was enjoyable and I'm not always a fan of eggs. Mixed in with the rice and this was a good meal.  Based on what I tried last night, I am more than happy to come back and try some other menu options. I know I like pancit. I know I like lumpia. Maybe there are some other dishes I have not tried yet that I will be equally as fond of. Good service. Good food. It works for me.",

    "text": "Yes, we could have walked over from our Sunset Station Hotel room. But we drove.   Location: On the grounds of the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. A sort of mini mall area consisting of this and several other businesses. On the Sunset Rd side of the large property. Just across from the big shopping mall.  Venue: Large pleasant shop with lots of tables and a counter for ordering. Nothing too fancy.  Food: My wife wasn't feeling well and was craving some soup. Meaning some sort of Asian or Filipino soup. However once we got to the counter and looked at the menu, she wanted grilled fish and a couple of other dishes including pork guisantes and pancit. In fact, she got sort of excited at all of the choices and changed her order several times while forgetting all about the soup. I was looking for a meat free dish and spotted Mongo/Mung Beans with an option of malungay leaves. My wife explained to them that I was looking for vegetarian food. So they made it without fish sauce. It turned out to be good. To me it was thoughtful that they tried to make something special for me. I did try the pork guisantes and pancit and the peas, vegetables and sauce was as good as it gets. The pancit was good too but not as good as my wife's. She said it was very good for a restaurant version.  I was asked, by the owner, if I liked the mung beans and I did. She said that without the fish sauce it would have no flavor. However I had added a half vinegar and half soy sauce mixture to carefully enhance the taste to my liking. It was originally a bit bland without the usual salty fish paste.   Everyone was Friendly:  My wife is pretty outgoing. Before long she had the owner and several other customers talking about their food and sharing their life stories and having generally having a nice conversation. A fun time was had by all !   We enjoyed it so much that we didn't take any pictures. Most importantly the quality of the food was excellent and authentic. We were both happy that we stopped in at Thelma's.",

I hate writing bad reviews, but I just couldn't take the food experience we just had. The pork adobo was not fresh at all and it tasted bland. The sinigang beef was SO HARD. Like i couldn't even chew it; I gave up. The sinigang soup tasted like ginger or spoiled. I couldve just made a better filipino food myself. It was really a waste of money. :(",

We walked in around 300p and it was quite empty and only one person in the restaurant.  So we walked up to the counter where the menu was at and placed our order.  It probably took about 10 minutes before the first of our orders came out.  I have to say, it was well worth the wait.  My son had mungo beans with marungay (very flavorful),  while the others had the Thelma's special, igado, pancit, squid guisado, dinaguan.  The food was piping hot and you could tell it wasn't sitting and being reheated.  Hats off to the chef, even my husband commented that this visit was way better than our last.  Now we have another go-to place to stop in.  When your in the Henderson area of Las Vegas give them a try!",

Plus they all speak Tagalog and they have the TV set on TFC channel so you can eat Filipino food and catch up on the Filipino dramas while you're at it! Only place that feels like home when I go! :)",

Took a quick look at their menu and knew I had to try their pork adobo (SIDE NOTE: if a Filipino restaurant can't make a delicious adobo dish, there's a problem). Also decided to try their Thelma's Special... which stole the show.   2 item combo ended up costing roughly $8 dollars and came with 2 scoops of rice (or 1 scoop rice, 1 scoop mac salad). Great bargain. As mentioned in other reviews, dining area is clean, service friendly BUT... the air-conditioning was lacking. A bit warm but nothing to be crazy concerned about. Look forward to coming back and trying their other dishes!",

The lady working there was also so nice and sweet, it is self/service but she was very attentive making sure we had every thing we needed.   The lumpia is so good! Fried fresh to order so it came out crispy and burn your tongue hot! I do noticed that their lumpia is more expensive than other places like Fiesta Filipina (6 pieces for $6) but the lumpia do have more stuffing and is thicker than other places. The garlic rice did not have as much flavor as I expected but was still good. The crispy pork belly with onions and tomato was so good!   Would definitely be coming back if I am in the area!",

But she doesn't live here, so when I want my cravings satisfied I gotta do what I gotta do (sorry mom lol).   This place is clean and the staff is nice. It is a lot pricier than other Filipino restaurants but it's good, and I'll pay for good food. My favorite is the Thelma's special *drool* I always have it when I come and the flavors are just too hard to give up even when I know this dish is probably really bad for me haha. The lechon is always crunchy, I've never had it soggy and the veggies are always fresh. I love the longanisa here it's so good. And I always upgrade my white rice to garlic rice because that's the only way to do it. The silet is good, I asked for mine extra crunchy the last time I went it was a little bitter but it wasn't too bad when I dipped it in the chili water sauce. The sinigang soup is delicious, but not as sour as I like mine. Overall, I have found this place to come closest to my mom's cooking and I never have a bad experience here.",

Thelma's serves Illocano food and it is very familiar  and almost as good as Grandma's cooking. You read that right...ALMOSTas good as. LOL They have a good menu and offer either dishes or  combination plates. We ordered: Pinakbet, Pancit, Chicken adobo, and a Halo halo. They were all good especially the pinakbet- its been awhile since i had pinakbet.  The restaurant was very spacious and clean. You can't see the restaurant from Sunset Rd. or Marks St. But they are in same complex as Aloha Kitchen & Vitamin World across from Best Buy.  The service was also very good and the food came out quick. My little pinoy princess also got a free treat. Salamat!  I will definitely be going back very soon. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu.  Aloha!!",

I feel like I was just robbed of $25 for some sub-par mediocre longonisa, thelma's lechon special and shanghai lumpia....NO.  Absolutely NEVER EVER EVER again.  If this place was once good - it's sure is not anymore. I ordered pick-up and the girl who took my order was the sweetest thing, but the food is horrible.....this was my first time trying this place and with the reviews I've read I was expecting them to be at least as good as my favorite spot near Siena hospital - but sadly they failed miserably and I can't even believe I wanted to compare the two with one another. My husband loves longonisa, but one bite into one of six pieces, he stopped and put the rest on my plate and said he can't finish it because the taste makes him want to vomit.  I felt soooooo bad - he asked me to pick this specific dish up and I should've just went to our usual spot.  Then, the overly onion-saturated special ruined the other entree - and what was up with the lechon pieces all having no meat??  The pieces were cut up as small as the diced tomatoes and onions and was pure skin and fat.  REALLY? Like whoever was going to eat this dish wouldn't notice there was no meat? I honestly do not know what everyone likes here.  7pm when i walked in and the place was completely empty....there was a non-appealing smell coming from the kitchen area too and I felt really bad and sad for them, but now after tasting what they have to offer, I too will be added to the list of non-existent customers for this place. Oh, and the shanghai lumpia was cold....not cold like it was just sitting around for a while - like cold, not cooked all the way through in the middle cold.  Yeah, like I said - FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF this place.  You all can have it.",

We've been to several Filipino restaurants while in Vegas, and this is by far the best. We ordered and shared the dishes family style: pumpkin guisado, lechon kawali, sinigang, oxtail soup, adobo fried rice, garlic fried rice and bangus.  The pumpkin guisado was everyone's favorite. I'm still craving it now as I'm typing this! Of course we were curious about what our parents thought, since my mom was taught to cook by my auntie who went to culinary art school. She loved it and appreciated how the food wasn't so oily like it is at most filipino restaurants are. Dad proclaimed that he has never been so full in a good way in a long time.   Hope to go back to this location or the one in Hawaii!",

We go there when we are in that area since I have not found a Filipino restaurant near where we live that I like. For me, this has the basics of the Filipino food that I like: pansit & adobo and it is good & cheap. The portions for a mixed plate are kind of small, but enough. I like the shoyu chicken more than the adobo. The only negative is I am a big fan of monggo. I like mine \"soupy\" with spinach and shrimp. Theirs is thick and creamy almost with fatty pork-not a fan of that version. Everything else I have tried there has been pretty good and not overly greasy like other Filipino restaurants.",

Unlike most Filipino restaurants where the food is on display in all its delicious glory, you order from a menu with the cashier. I was fine with that but extremely disappointed with what was served 30 minutes later, even after I tipped 20% before getting my food. Should not have done that since it didn't alter the poor quality of food or lack of service.  I ordered Dinuguan but got bland, tough cubes of pork in a very watered down sauce. It should be tender meat in a thick, dark flavorful sauce. The Pinakbet was a tiny portion of mushy vegetables and must have been a few days old. Their Shoyu Chicken was incredibly bland, and the white rice was hard, bottom of the rice cooker crap. The food all came out a little cooler than room  temperature. Yuck!   Unfortunately, by the time my food arrived, it was 10 minutes from closing. I really should have asked for a refund, but I was so hungry that I just sucked it up and ate a few bites. Definitely THE WORST Filipino food I have ever had! Will never come back.",

We had to eat it or else my Hawaiian grandmaddah would come with her cane and wack us! Lol  Growing up in Oahu we have many choices to choose from to eat from. Now, living in the continent very limited to your resources and you make due.. Looking on Yelp actually for something else and we coming across Thelmas in Las Vegas - say whhaaat? No ways, never knew they had a restaurant here in Las Vegas and when we saw they had Lechon Kawali, there is no doubt my husband was on a mish, we are going!   Im not one that cares to much eating pork. However, when tasting their pork adobo and lechon it was really tender, moist & tasty that my husband was surprised I ate it!... there pork lumpia was Okay, I think im spoiled because when my Aunty makes her pork lumpia - its really big, lots of Veggie mixed with pork and she gives me the homemade vinegar/Shoyu sauce.   Their pancit was delicious and the taste consistency of back home.   The customer service was amazing and the entire place very nice Clean....  Now that we know they are here Itll be our go to choices when in the area!",

When the craving for some home cooking hits - I gotta have it and I gotta have it fast! I called in take out order for Beef Nilaga Soup and Bisteak (carne asada). I received great customer service on the other end, where the lady was polite, and read back my order loud and clear. As I was driving there to pick up my order she calls me back to say they were out of the bisteak and offered something else, I then changed my order to chicken adobo no biggie - it was towards the end of the night so I wasn't trippin'.  I like how she offered something else, that's customer service.   I arrived and met the gal who took my order - again greeted promptly with a smile. She advised me that my order will be ready in 10 and it was ready way before that! Thank you.   The beef nilaga is where it's at! This is beef short rib soup that consists of green beans, potatoes, carrots, onions and pure love broth! It's delicious seriously reminds me of home! Order this and eat it over fresh garlic rice!!! Bomb dot come y'all!   The chicken adobo was \"fall off the bone\" thighs! Lots of garlic and onion flavor! I'm a fan, try this too!   Super happy that I tried Thelma's - I'll be back!",

Their menu is extensive last I went but I just stick to my usual favorites and you can't go wrong.  Love Thelma's, especially because it's from my home town. Food and service was quick and awesome.

    "text": "We were at Hoover Dam and decided to check out a Filipino restautant for lunch on our way back to The Strip.  This place has awesome Yelp reviews so I looked no further than that. However, I was quite disappointed with the food as the taste were subpar. The restaurant itself is nice, clean, well-tended to and is in a lovely location. The staff were mostly in the kitchen. There was a young lady tending the register and cleaning the tables.  They have the Filipino channel on for your dining enjoyment.  I ordered a combination plate with pancit mix and squid guisado served with a scoop of rice and some macaroni salad. I'm not being mean but I've been to Filipino restaurants in other parts of the country and they were all family-owned with homestyle cooking and the food always reminded me of home, the Philippines. Thelma's only slightly did. My pancit mix was so bland, the squid guisado had some authentic flavors but a bit too fishy for my taste. The mac salad, however, was flavorful and well-made. It reminded me of some of the get togethers I've had with family and friends in Hawaii when I lived there. I'd love their recipe!  Dining partner, who is also quite versed in Filipino food commented on how the food was only OK. He ordered a combo of pork adobo and pinakbet. I tried both and agreed with the assessments. While I don't often cook Filipino food at home, I do try to every so often and unfortunately if my pancit is better then it's really not a good sign. So, I guess I don't really understand what's up with all the great reviews and rating. Did I come in on an off day? Well, it's up to you to decide but I cannot give this place a better rating than a 2 overall.",

    "text": "In order to find Thelma's Filipino Restaurant, you would have to turn right from Sunset Road, drive all the way to the back of the building, and it's facing directly toward Sunset Station Hotel Casino. The restaurant looks clean and spacious. They have pretty floral decor on every table. And when you dine-in, you can watch TFC which is The Filipino Channel for music, show time, and entertainment. They have an extensive menu that includes a selection of meat entrees for pork, beef, chicken, seafood, and they offer soup, noodles, mixed plate, vegetable, and a few of the more popular Filipino desserts like Halo Halo and Banana Lumpia.  I ordered Tocino Chicken ($9.99) which is sweet marinated boneless chicken thighs, and also requested Garlic Rice ($1.75). The Tocino Chicken came with slices of raw onions. The meat portion is plentiful and the food looks savory and appetizing, however the chicken itself taste rather chewy. I'm under the impression the chicken is boneless, but I end up biting into some surprising bones found in the meat. And that does not taste good. Now the Garlic Rice taste okay, it is so light that you can hardly taste any garlic. Honestly, I prefer if they added a little more garlic to actually put flavor in the rice. When you eat raw onions with Tocino Chicken, you get a crunchy, chewy texture and a strong unappealing taste. As for beverages they have a soda fountain. And the lemon water is free, you can get unlimited refills.   Primarily what is disappointing is the service. The person who place my order is not friendly or welcoming. When I walk into the restaurant, the person just stared. I end up greeting the person \"hello.\" The place is empty and I feel awkward dining in. I really want to enjoy the food, but I just didn't feel any good vibe about this restaurant.",

    "text": "Ok folks let me tell you about this place. So it's not fancy or anything. It feels like a family restaurant you would find in Hawaii. Better off coming in shorts, flip flops and a T. It's one of those places where people eat everyday at. After eating there a week they will probably know your name and favorite meal. It's local. You walk in, very relaxed, mosey through the menu and then walk up to the counter. Have a chat place your order and sit and chill. No rush. It's a Fillipino restaurant and the food isn't amazing, but it's REALLY good home cooking. which I think is exactly what they are going for. Make u feel at home.   The staff are really friendly. Treat you like your cousins or something like that. The place is clean. The decor is old school Hawaiian family restaurant. It could literally be in 50 first dates.   I ordered the 2 meat special. I got pork adobo, shoyu chicken, lumpia Shanghai, rice and macaroni salad. The pork was tasty. It was a little fatty but still tasty. The lumpia was also tasty. Not my favorite sauce to dip in but again it was good. Rice was good and so was the macaroni salad. Now the Shoyu Chicken was DA BOMB!!!! Just right amount of sweet with salt and chicken that falls off the bone. I gobbled that right up. It was like being at your families BBQ with really good food. I didn't get up and slap my momma or anything......MOMMA!!!! But I did shake her hand very hard.......VERY HARD!!!!  All in all I will be back to Thelma! Good Job Cousins!!! LOL!!!!",

Last Sunday we went to go help her Lola and wanted to bring food to feed everyone. The first place we stopped at didn't have Pancit. Who doesn't have pancit?! So onward we go looking through yelp at places nearby and happened to come across this place.  When we walked in it was set up like a restaurant instead of a buffet style lunch, I liked that. We went to the counter and were greeted right away. We placed an order for a medium size pan of Pancit and a 30 piece order of Lumpia. The cashier told us it would be about ten minutes so we took a seat and waited.  I noticed a corner set up with the vinegar, chili water, soy sauce and a few other things to go with the food. I went over and filled a few up to take with us. I liked that the station was clean as well as the rest of the restaurant.   When our food was done the cashier brought us over a box with the pan of pancit, the container of lumpia and silverware, plates and a container of cut lemons. I was so excited that they thought that far and prepared all of this for us.   In the car we could not wait any longer and had a few lumpia while driving to our destination. The lumpia was hot and fresh, they had just cooked them. That lumpia was some of the best I have had, not counting Lola's of course.   The entire family really enjoyed the food, the pancit was flavorful, not greasy and absolutely delicious. It was made fresh for us when we ordered it as well. I was highly impressed with this place and cannot wait to go back and try more of their menu.  Highly Recommend!",

The restaurant's food has a influences with other Asian cultures; this is probably very common amongst them to share certain food items.  Atmosphere - A Strip mall restaurant hiding on the back without a direct view from the street.  The small sign in front allowed me to find the place.    Food Appetizer - Did not order any.  Main Course - I ordered the Lechon Kawali, I ordered this based on the picture at the front near the register.  The crunch was amazing.  I can not even describe the sauce but it was amazing.  The plate came with raw onion slices.  The three together were wonderful.  Afterwards I had to look up exactly what Lechon Kawali was, and found out it was the belly of the pig, which explained the crunch so well.  I also order Spam Wasubi, which I have had at a Hawaiian restaurant.  It was a daily special and not on the menu.  I could have order three of these and been very happy just eating that for lunch.   Dessert - Did not order any.  Service - It was fast food as you went to the counter, but they delivered the food to your table without asking for names or giving you table tent number.  The lady working was great, I had a hard time saying Kawali, and she made sure I learned it with ease.  I find that some of the fun going to a ethnic restaurant trying to learn their language. Somehow she knew another plate we wanted to order by just reading our facial expressions, amazing.  They have a pop machine that was self service.  While we waited for our food extra plates were brought to us so we all could share each other's foods, similar to a Chinese restaurant.",

If you're out of town and you're looking for this place - set your GPS to find the Sunset Station Casino, then look to the small strip center directly in front of the Casino.  We got two kinds of Lechon - the \"traditional\" kawali style and \"Thelma's Special\" - the kawali was EXCELLENT - super crispy and the perfect cuts of meat, fat, and crispy skin.  Kare-Kare, Shanghai Lumpia, Boneless Bangus, and (of course) Pork BBQ all hit the table very quickly and freshly cooked.  Perhaps my favorite part is the \"openness\" of their kitchen - you can clearly see it from the dining room, as well as the back hallway leading to the restrooms, where they have a large window that lets you really see behind the scenes.  Being in the restaurant business for the last 20+ years, I've really come to an appreciation of any business (especially Family owned) that has a high standard of cleanliness and food safety.  The staff was very friendly - didn't mind speaking to our mixed group in either Tagalog or English - and responded to every request eagerly and with genuine hospitality.  Looks like our family has a new \"regular\" spot whenever we come to Vegas!!!  Maraming Salamat!",

If you haven't had a lot of Filipino food you can either buy one of everything or just get the choice of four mixed plate so you can try at least 4 dishes. i haven't tried the ones here yet but try sinigang soup, pinakbet, lechon, beef or chicken adobo, lumpia, and the since it hot right now halo halo. all the pictures from the other yelpers also help.  saw some delicious looking pictures of omelet and fried rice dishes so i'll be back.",

On March 25, 2017 around lunch time I was passing thru to see My Love (Future Wife) when I decided to get something to eat. I been to so many Fhilipino Restaurant and I was not satisfied with any. So I went online to look for a Fhilipino Restaurant when I came across THELMA's FHILIPINO RESTAURANT and saw it was a 4 Star. What I was surprised was that on the comments it said it was clean area, so I decided to check if it's clean. When I got to the Restaurant I was surprise everywhere was clean and from where I can see from behind the cash register it was also clean. I looked in the restroom and at the table I sat at and all where so clean. What surprise me was that one of there Special Mixed plate which consist of multiple choices they had and prices they had were so reasonable there shouldn't be anyone to complain. So yes I am so happy I found an awesome Fhilipino Restaurant in Henderson, Nevada and I'm always passing thru the area 3-5 times a month, but starting from today I'll always always stop by the Restaurant every time I'm around. So if you want to make every penny you spent worth it then by all means go to that restaurant and if not it's ok cause I'll eat some for you.....lol",

I went on a Wednesday evening, and was a bit disappointed that they didn't have my favorite dish, the binagoongan.  Gosh how hard it is to find that dish!  However, I thought the price of the menu items were quite fair.  We got the Lechon Kawaii, which was pretty crispy and yummy, w/ a big bowl of rice to accompany it.  We also ordered the mixed plate, which we chose the following four items (there is a list of items one may chose):  -Pork Adobo:  It was tasty, like any other places, just less sauce...I like my sauce too. -Pancit Mix:  I should have stick with my favorite Pancit...Pancit Palabok -Dinuguan: Pretty good.  Don't let the blackish/purplish color scared you...pretty delicious -Thelma Special:  This dish includes chunks of lechon mixed with diced tomatoes and onions.  Well, I learned quickly that I liked my lechon crisp and as is versus all the frills.    Then I was ready for my current favorite dessert..Halo Halo.  There was barely any ube icecream, and there was no rice crisp!  The rice crisp adds texture and I totally missed it.  I usually finish the whole halo-halo, no matter how full I am, but I only ate half and dumped the rest.  I was very very very disappointed. :(  The service was wonderful.  Our cashier/server was super friendly.  I probably will go back to try other items, but won't be ordering my halo-halo there (save myself from disappointment).",

I'm sad that this place is so far from my house - because I would love to eat here more often. The service was great. Everyone was friendly, and attentive to our needs. The place is pretty new as well - so everything is nice and clean.   Food was pretty good - but they didn't have as big of a selection as I would hope they had. I ended up having the mix plate - consisting of Thelma's Special and Chicken Adobo. I loved Thelma's Special, but it came with a bit too many onions for me - it heavily outweigh the amount of tomatoes I received. Other than that, it was good. Sauce was good and so was the lechon kawali. The chicken in the adobo was very tender - but overall the dish was a bit too salty for my liking.   Someone else ended up ordering the Tocino... I didn't try it - but it definitely wasn't the type of Tocino I'm used to eating. But, it still looked good.   Overall - if I were in the area, I would go back to eat there. Prices were decent, and I'm always down to eat more Filipino food. But, it's not something that I would drive to that side of town for.",

It's more like, your cool \"Ate's Resto!\"  We tried out Thelma's for lunch during our last venture into Vegas and Thelma's is like no other Filipino restaurant I've been to.  It's huge, it's clean, it's organized, it doesn't smell, it's not sticky and damn the food is good!  The one thing that irks me about your typical Filipino restaurant is that the food is sitting in a buffet of chaffing dishes behind a window where you have to point and ask, \"What's that?\"   Thelma's offers up a menu that is straight forward; pick an item or two, or three, with rice.    I had the Thelma's Special, which is kind of like, Sisig that married Tokwa't Baboy, which tasted okay, not sure I'd order it again.  I also had their Dinuguaan which was pretty damn tasty, gotta love my chocolate meat.  For my third item, I had the Chicken Adobo, which was pretty good, a little sweet, but good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gWeYW0E5Tfmmj_9fugfLNw?select=Npu-vw7X5rs60Cvq9YhykA  Not sure if the lady helping us was Thelma herself but regardless, the lady was super sweet and always was smiling, which is quite refreshing rather than dealing with a grouchy Nanay who gives you a dirty look because you're speaking to her in English and not Tagalog.  But of course, what's a Filipino restaurant without TFC blaring on the TV?  What's sad is that we enjoyed our food while laughing at the corny and shamefully funny antics of this game show we were watching that when we got home, I just had to order TFC, damn you Thelma! :)  Definitely hit up Thelma's if you're in this part of town, or on your way to/from Sunset Station, no finger pointing here. ;)",

The difference is this location doesn't have a buffet but it is much nicer and cleaner looking. If there's only 2 of you and you're both pretty hungry, I would say you best bet is the 4 choice mix plate for around $10 (my fav combo-pancit mix, guisantes, squid guisado, mongo beans) which comes with 2 scoops of rice. Their bangus sinigang ($13) is pretty good. The one thing I didn't like was their oxtail soup. It only had oxtail (small ones), onions, and some other vegetable which in my opinion is not worth the price. Parking is plentiful as its located near Sunset Station and Casino. Funny story alert...I called for a takeout order once and asked if they had Bicol Express as my wife was craving it. When I asked if they had it, the female employee replied, \"Umm..what's that?\" My wife and I laughed hysterically...",

Our culture is a mix plate of cultures, and this place executes the flavors of both Hawaii and Philippines so well.    The atmosphere of this restaurant is soooo welcoming, it gives me a sense of \"HOMEY\" feeling.  I was surprised with the cleanliness of the restaurant, I was expecting the same \"ELENA'S\" surrounding.    I ordered the mix plate which consisted of: - Pancit Mix - Almost close to my mother's home cooking.  A mixture of flavor, I personally thought it was Pancit heaven.   - Pinakbet - I've been having cravings of my mother's pinakbet ever since I left home.  While this was somewhat close, the vegetables my mother usually added weren't there.  It was good regardless, and the flavor of the patis sauce was there to.  I loved how it was the \"ILOKANO\" way of making pinakbet, as opposed to the Tagalog way of adding shrimp paste.   - Thelma's special - Wow I've been looking everywhere for this.  It's basically Lechon kawali soaked in soy sauce, onions, and tomatoes.  Mines was a little on the \"oniony\" side, but it was definitely delicious.  My dad usually makes this dish using the head of the pig and BBQing it, then chopping it into pieces while adding cow brains, oninos, tomatoes, vinegar, and soy sauce.    I would definitely say, this is by far one of the BEST FILIPINO foods I've had in Vegas.  Getting the Thelma's Special is a must!",

Food is as good as it gets BUT i must say... not as great as the Hawaii's location.  But i'm still a fan! I guess it all depends on the cooks.... The Thelma's special is what their known for which is THA BOMB!!! the portion... not too much for $8 but it's STILL sooo good when you wanna satisfy that craving! I've been craving pork igado for awhile living in Vegas & out of all the filipino restaurants out here, they had it! It all depends on who cooked it though to be honest. One time it would be soo good & perfect & another time it would taste totally off. Unfortunately on my recent stop here, it's not on their menu anymore.  I asked the lady (who always took my orders since it opened btw. Super nice & bubbly filipino gal) said it wasn't too popular so they took it off their menu.  Too bad because all they needed to do was work on the recipe & it woulda been totally popular.  Restaurant is always clean, they serve you, & the workers are really really nice. Not once did I ever have any workers act like they didn't wanna be there.  A must try for all you Vegas locals for your filipino cuisine.  Oh! Another dish to try is the adobo fried rice. So gooood..... There's actually quite a bit that's good. You won't be disappointed. =)",

I definitely recommend this place to all my Filipino friends who needs a good \"home cooked\" meal. adobo fried rice is my favorite :)",

Same bomb Thelma's Special, Adobo fried rice, Gisantes, all the favorites, the only thing missing is the little buffet that the OG restaurant puts out. The exchancge is a neat, huge dinning area with flat screen on the Filipino channel. Now i'm not filipino but my wife is so I can appreciate this kind of stuff. I always include a star for places that have orange fanta on their soda taps. Free refils of course. The food for those of you who don't know is the closest thing you'll find to a filipino home cooked meal ever in vegas. Excellent execution of traditonal filipino dishes. I may just be saying this cause I grew up on these exact take out plates and to be reunited again with my childhood comfort food is just a little too much. Tear. Clean and wide open dinning area, warm friendly staff gives this place six stars no seven....",

Of the dishes I sampled, their Kare-Kare was the shining star with real peanutty flavor and lovely oxtail and veggies. This Sinigang Stew with Shrimp  (a sour soup made with a tamarind base) was pretty good and arrived with ample shrimp. I personally wish it was twice as sour but it satisfied.  Less impressive were several dishes:  The Lumpiang Shanghai, a deep-fried meat-filled spring roll with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, lacked flavor and texture.  The Pancit Palabok craved seasoning and any anato seed flavor. The rice noodles were unexpectedly thin like a vermicelli but the lack of flavor was the main issue.  The Halo-Halo (mix-mix) Special as dessert was just pure disappointment.  In their menu, the regular Halo-Halo description included several components while the Special seemed to include the regular ingredients plus Ube (purple sweet root crop) ice cream. The special arrived in an okay-looking presentation of crushed ice with condensed or evaporated milk, red nata de coco (coconut gel), something else that was red and seemingly coconut-based, as well as Ube ice cream. It was missing red beans, garbanzos, macapuno (shredded, sweetened coconut) and pinipig (crunchy, crushed young rice). Any addition of even just one of those ingredients would make it Truer to its name.",

My go-to filipino restaurant in henderson but its a mix of hawaiian so you get 2 in 1, been coming here since I moved here from the philippines.  Food is always fresh though they take their sweet time to cook it so who am I to complaining why it's taking forever right?  KARE-KARE - Just like how its cooked in the philippines Make sure you ask for more bagoong because it's a pretty big bowl, but 30% meat and 70% vegetables! Bummer PORK SINIGANG - I think they need to make it a bit sour but then again some people doesn't like it too sour so yah its good! The pork is not really pork its more of a beef so I don't know how to feel abou thtis lol but it's good even its not pure pork! ADOBO FRIED RICE(chicken) - Make sure you get over easy eggs on this, it's actually good! PORK ADOBO - Surprisingly, it's not good considering this is a famous dish!  SPAM MUSUBI - NO WORDS. PERFECT! How can you possibly ruin a spam musubi?  CONS Make sure you order some extra rice because this asian restaurant is weird on their rice! They're not generous at all! LOL but the customer service person is always in a good mood and not once they messed up my order.   So yes try this place!",

Of course I ordered the Bangus breakfast plate, with garlic fried rice and 2 eggs over easy.  I ordered mini spam fried rice for the kids and a pork BBQ on a stick for each of them. Thelma's is an actual restaurant, not  \"turo turo\" style, so the food is cooked to order.   So, the kids and I grabbed a table, sat down, and waited patiently for our food while we watched Filipino soap operas.  And we waited.  And waited. And waited some more.  Sadly, there was only 1 party ahead of us. After 38 minutes, the food finally came, but by then I was losing my mind- because I had 2 very hungry and now cranky kids.    At least the food was good comfort food.  And the mini fried rice was a huge order- so much that even after the kids devoured it- we still had leftovers to take home.  And the bangus with binegar hit the spot.   The restaurant is huge, plenty of seating.  The service was friendly. The prices are higher than the \"turo turo\" places. I just wish I had brought a snickers bar in my purse to alleviate those \"hangry pains\" (hungry + angry) that crept up while we were waiting.   *Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 52/100*",

The menu had a decent amount of choices to pick from.  However, the amount of food you get verses the price is kind of slim.  Also, the amount of fat on the adobo I ordered was extremely high!  About 40% of my \"meat\" was fat that I had to cut off.  For people who enjoy eating the fat that might not be a problem but for me that's way too high!  I, also, do know that it's more traditional to leave some fat on the meat in Filipino cooking but 40% is still way too high!    My daughter ordered the shiyou chicken and got 2 thighs and 2 scoops of rice for around $5.50.  I, personally, don't really consider that much for $5.50.  The amount of chicken was just ok-for that price I'd have expected something more meaty like a breast or a thigh and a drumstick but it should have also had rice and some sort of vegetable to balance it out.    One thing that I did like is that they skimmed off some of the liquid fat that's been rendered from cooking on top of the adobo sauce.  The meat that we both did get to eat was flavorful too.  Otherwise this would have been a 1 star rating.    Maybe I just went on an off day with the adobo-I hope so!",

You could get your classic chicken adobo, pancit, dinuguan, langonisa sausage (greatest sausage ever), Iechon , etc. I recommend going in for the lunch special, because you can get a large amount of food for like $7. Depending what you order, you'll probably even get enough for leftovers. I would also add a sinegang soup to your order. They make it salty, but delicious.  If you've never had Filipino food before, my go to dish is the lechon. It's a pig roast with super crispy skin. In the Philippines we set the pig on the table and pick at the delicious skin before getting to the meat. At Thelma's, they'll chop it up for you so you'll get pieces with plenty of meat and skin...and fat.",

Not perfect but pretty damn good.  We came with an appetite and ordered a crap load of food. We ordered so much food, they moved us from a small table to a big table. Yeah, it was just me and my hunny and my son.  The following is what we devoured:  Spam Masubi Longanisa Masubi Lechon Kawali Marinated Bangus A mixed plate with: rice and macaroni salad, shoyu chicken, pancit mix, and squid guisado. Another mixed plate with: rice, squid guisado, pinkabet and dinuguan.  I fell absolutely in love with their lechon. Some of the best in this valley that I have tried to be honest. Their mang sauce is definitely not watered down like other restaurants do. (My mouth is watering just thinking about the lechon now). It was fried perfectly with a perfect ratio of skin, to fat, to meat. And most importantly, it didn't leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.  The bangus was on point and was boneless. An extra plus for my hunny.   The squid guisado was delicious as well. Not overpowered by the bagoong.  I find that a lot of places fill their pinakbet with squash and this was a good balance of all veggies.   Both of the masubi's were delicious and the fact that I could order a longanisa masubi made me very excited.    Honestly, it was all good. Except the dinuguan left me very disappointed. I was not a fan of the taste or texture of this one.  We spend a little under $40 for all the food and had plenty to take home.   Just know that if you order hot tea, it is simply a lipton tea bag and they give the hot water and lemon and honey.   And if you like they play TFC on the TV.  Gawin ang iyong sarili ng ilang mabuti at kumain sa Pilipino restaurant na ito nang hindi bababa sa isang beses.",

Granted, not to toot my own horn, but I can cook the hell out of some Filipino dishes, it became a bit lackluster when we tried other dishes. We like the kare-kare. It's creamy and very tasteful. The Thelma special left me wanting, there just wasn't enough pork and not a whole lot of taste. The pork longganisa is pretty good, but I liked my well done, almost burnt because I hate that gamey taste.   We went there today for some bangus (milk fish) since it's good Friday and it was the closest place that had bangus around our neck of the woods. The bangus was good, but we also got some garlic fried rice and my wife got a spam musubi. The garlic fried rice was really greasy and mushy and there was no taste of garlic, just saturated with oil. Also the spam musubi had no sauce. So we paid for spam and rice in seaweed. Ew! So it was just really disappointing and I feel sick from all that oil.  I hope they get their chef straightened up!",

Thelma's special is their lechon kawali with tomatoes and onions, which has a ton of flavor, but you can always just order the lechon kawali plain if you prefer using an alternative sauce (Mang Tomas, Soy Sauce/Lemon). Other items I have really enjoyed here are the longanisa fried rice, which comes in mini or regular versions, and the kare kare. I would call ahead to confirm their hours because I have definitely made the trip here only for them to be closed. Their version of halo halo is bean-less, so I probably wouldn't order that from here again, but with all their other tasty options, it doesn't matter to me too much. One of the things that makes me happy about this place is that it is frequented by both Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike - glad to see Filipino food is making a name for itself!",

My 2 star rating might contradict my first sentence, but the reason for my review is just to bring awareness to the business owners in reference to my last 2 visits at Thelmas.  The worst business mistake is inconsistency. I always order the Thelmas special when I go to Thelmas and the last 2 times i went it was HORRIBLE. Same issue with the Longanisa fried rice and Thelmas special musubi!  All I tasted was OIL. There was no flavor but OIL flavor. I couldn't eat it, I had to send it back and when they tried to \"fix it\", it was just as bad.  Could it be that there's a different chef?  Whatever the issue was I HOPE it gets fixed because I can't go on in life without the \"original\" Thelmas special; flavorful, crispy..... and perfect! Please stay consistant... thats what brings people back for more!",

No refills if you're sharing.\" Nobody in Vegas does this. Then my food portions are smaller. Ridiculous! You guys are going to keep losing business with those poor practices.

Everything has been delicious and once again, reminiscent of home (Hawaii). Just a few things we have ordered and liked: chicken adobo friend rice, pork adobo, chicken adobo, dinuguan (I don't eat the chocolate meat but my family loves it), pork gisantes, pancit and shoyu chicken. Items are flavorful and as least greasy as this type of cuisine can be.   The staff is friendly and patient-we order a lot and frequently.

Pork giusantes; stewed pork with peas and pimentos and tomato very tender and flavorful my favorite of the three, also had the pancit very thin rice noodles , good flavor.  Overall it was good  , nice  portions and flavorful if in the area would not hesitate to stop by , but would not make a special trip like I did this time . Service was friendly and prompt",

    "text": "So I've lived by this place since it opened. I never went. When my mom arrived here in November, my brother took her here for lunch and brought back leftovers. She brought back adobo and oxtail soup. I ate the leftovers and thought it was pretty good.   Then, a few Sundays later, I met up with them there and we ate lumpia shanghai, the Thelma's special, adobo, pancit mix, oxtail soup and shoyu chicken. For desert we had banana lumpia and ice cream in a bowl.   Then a week later, I told Chris about it and he said, \"Dang I'm jealous, I wanted to go too!\" So we did. We shared and adobo fried rice and lechon kawali.   Then when my dad came, we came here again and pretty much had the same things, except my dad had some kind of fish soup (I forget the name of this fish) and the food was just as delicious. So...this review will be on the items I have eaten thus far.   Experience - 4.5 (out of 5) Taste of the food - 5 (no complaints)  Beverages - 5 (soda fountain, all you can drink plus they still give you a glass of water too and refill upon request).  Location - 5  Price for the food - 4  Staff- 4 Clean bathroom - 5 Safe parking lot - 5  Have a TV and the football game was on so Chris was happy - 5 Overall rating: 4.722  The portions for the price are decent. Even though my plate was a \"2 choice\" (pork adobo and pancit mix with one scoop of rice and one scoop of mac salad), the way they serve their meals, and you can easily share with whoever is dining with you. My brother had the shoyu chicken and Thelma's special and my mom had the oxtail soup. The food was plentiful and with tip came to about $50 (with 3 beverages). Seems kinda pricey for a Filipino joint, but this isn't some pick from a steam table place. It's a sit down and wait for some good grub kinda place.  I like supporting Filipinos. I like supporting Filipinos that I think are from Hawaii. (Almost everyone that was there had some kind of \"I'm from Hawaii\" type shirt or had their \"Island Pride\" sticker on the back of their vehicles.)  I like supporting businesses that treat their patrons with respect and are appreciative that we're spending our money in their establishment.   My only suggestion: the banana lumpia ice cream mix thing is yummy...just wish they put in 2 lumpias not one. I had to share this with my brother and was about to deck him for the whole thing (j/k). It was one scoop of ube ice cream with the banana lumpia sliced up and mixed together. Thanks Thelma's for giving me the idea to do that at home!!   Too bad I only itch for Filipino grub once in a while (yep, gotta watch the HBP and cholesterol since I'm not a young un' anymore!). But if I do, I'm coming back to Thelma's.   P.S. They have musubi there. Like 4 or 5 different kinds. Next time I'm going to try their longanisa musubi.   Bonus: It's about 6 minutes away from my house!",
