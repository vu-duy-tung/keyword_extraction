Menu items include tapas which are well priced and amazing flavor. The garlic edamame is wonderful with roasted garlic and Shoshito peppers.  The vegetable potstickers were also very good.  They serve cucumber water and have a superb wine list - with half price (select) wine on Thursdays!   They have vegetarian options as well as great dinner entrees with meat and seafood made  with fresh ingredients and sauces.  Staff was all very friendly and attentive which made the Experience well worth the visit. Would definitely recommend it and will add to my list of regular places to dine!",

We ordered: Chicken Satay Chicken pad thai Mussels  Garlic rice Mango and sticky rice  We didn't leave anything on our plates lol. Everything was so amazing. My favorite thing was the garlic rice and it was paired perfectly with the mussels! The broth on the mussels was so good by itself.  I would come here again and again and again. The decor is cute, food is great, and the service was good.",

    "text": "Wow. I've been here so many times in such a short time and it is my all-time favorite restaurant. The service is always amazing and the food is out of this world. I've tried many thai restaurants in Vegas and this has by far the best food. Try anything here, and you will not regret it!  Everytime I come, I always make sure to order the chicken pad thai, crispy pork belly, and of course, the mango sticky rice.  The chicken pad thai is very flavorful and it is bottom line AMAZING. The flavors really come alive once you squeeze the lemon on top. The noodles are always well cooked so there is a little chew to it.  The crispy pork belly is a hit or a miss with the portions. The difference in sizes vary with a big difference depending on the chef. But regardless, it is soooo good. I usually don't like foods with a lot of fat, but my goodness.. It just melts in your mouth with that very light crispiness. The sauce that it comes with on the side complements it very well. It is a tangy spicy sauce.  And my favorite... The MANGO WITH STICKY RICE! This place was the first place I've ever tried this dish. I will not eat this at any other place because my taste buds are spoiled! When I went a couple weeks ago, there wasn't any mangos ripe yet because it's not the right season, so we got the deep fried banana and it was just as delicious. The outside of the banana is not your typical tempura; it's coconut shavings! It added a crispiness that's almost like a chip. The banana is also topped with coconut ice cream, which has actual coconut in it! I asked for a side of sticky rice and it paired well together with the banana and ice cream.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Don't miss out on this gem!!!",

The wine list was also very good and impressive. We sat outside in the middle of October. It wasn't very chilly when we sat, but as the night went on... It became rather cold. We asked the server to put on the heat lamps, but they were out of propane. The food was delicious. They were able to modify certain items and make them vegan for me. Everything tasted wonderful. The food did take quite some time to come out, close to 45 min. Luckily it was worth the wait. I thought perhaps they forgot us, but apparently they were just slow or backed up. My dad said the lamb was the best he has ever had. The seating was comfortable and the staff was nice for the most part. The bathroom was also clean and nicely decorated. I will definitely be back.",

I've been to a few tapas joints but none are worthy of my 5 star rating. This is as best as it gets for both Thai and tapas :)! It's also definitely 2 $$s.  Absolutely no complaints about service either. This is also a very cozy little place so there's not a lot of room. It'll be a lot more busier during dinner time because of the small space. It's got dim lighting but it's a very peaceful environment especially with the soft music. The servers are ultra polite, professional, and friendly. You also get a special type of water but not sure if you can really taste it. If they didn't tell me at the beginning I don't think I would have noticed it at all. Ours had apple and something else (not sure) but I really couldn't taste it -- but that's not really important, I suppose :b.  WHAT WE ORDERED: Cilantro Steak Skewers (BBQ) Thai Wings Duck Breast Curry Family Style Coconut Ice Cream (has sticky rice)  THEY'RE ALL GOOD :)! So feel free to try them. Good as in I'd totally get them again. Heard some good things about the mango shrimp so I'll give that a try next time!",

    "text": "My husband and I had some good friends in town, and wanted to take them somewhere for dinner that they couldn't experience where they live. Nittaya's certainly fit the bill!  Speaking of bills, I'll start there - we were shocked when the bill arrived, and were anticipating it to be about 30% more than it was. For $120 (before tip), we ordered:  The famous tempura spinach salad Corn fritters  Wontons  Spring rolls Shrimp pad Thai Chicken pad Thai FOB rice Emerald rice  a Thai iced tea  If you've been here before, you know that is a lot of food! We took home leftovers for sure!  My friend is a pescetarian, and our server was happy to have our dressing for the spinach salad prepared without ground chicken. She also pointed out that the corn fritters contained pork when she brought them to the table, which I thought was nice since we were sharing, and my friend hasn't seen the item description.   My heat level here is 1-5, I ordered a 3 and was happy with that...their 3 would be a 4 at Le Thai. My FOB rice was astounding - full of tender chicken, and juicy pineapple. All the shared tapas were fantastic also!   Our friends have been to Las Vegas many times, and we love taking them different places each visit, but they have already requested we come back here on their next visit this fall! So glad we decided to let them in on one of Las Vegas' best Secrets.",

As we walked up to the venue we noticed that a considerable amount of people were already neatly tucked into their out door bistro style seating. We went in and immediately to our left was this kickback bar with a wall decorated with various wines. To the right was table and semi booth seating. The ambience was great! It was a mix between a hip dive bar and chic and exclusive eatery. This is a very cool place to take a date. The menu has plenty to choose from. We tried the corn fritters which were yummy, super delicious chicken lettuce wraps, green curry, avocado steak, volcano shrimp that was soo good I can still taste it and I  special requested a coconut curry chicken. To my delight, my curry was served in a roasted coconut bowl with sweet coconut lining the inside of the shell. I love love love loved it! The servers were attentive and accommodating. I'm looking forward to returning. If you love tai food or are looking for a great first time experience you should totally go here. It has an upbeat atmosphere that's great if you don't mind crowds.",

    "text": "Thai food in vegas can be quite difficult to find.  Next to Lotus of Siam, Nittaya's is my favorite.  They have some interesting dishes such as the spinach salad and the charred peppers and are also willing to account for those of us with dietary restrictions.  In addition to the above mentioned dishes I also had the basil eggplant with tofu.  I wish I had ordered it a 5 spicy, as I got the 3 and tasted no spice at all.  The flavor was great, and would get it again, just order a higher spice level.  The decor is great, the waitstaff is nice.  The place is tiny so reservations are recommended it was packed when we went.",

The place was a lot smaller than we had expected... it only had a few tables, and it was dimly lit.  The service was fantastic, though!  Our waitress Tatiana told us so much about the menu and about everything they do.  We tried to order the ahi tuna and another tapa, but they were out of those.  So we ended up getting the spinach salad, the minced shrimp puffs, and the shrimp pastry, as well as a dish of drunken noodles.  The shrimps dishes were OK, but not great.  The spinach salad was delicious!  No wonder this is their most popular item.  The drunken noodles was good, but the chicken wasn't in pieces and was kinda weird to me.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and the service will probably get me back in through their doors.  Hopefully I can try their ahi tuna next time.  Mmmmm.",

Twice they sent us the wrong plates (figuring it's such a small place, it should have been easier to get out order correct!) and twice we had to remind out server what we were still waiting for.

    "text": "Nittaya's Secret Kitchen won't be a secret much longer, as this tiny neighborhood gem in Summerlin has a lot of potential. Tucked back in a small strip center off Lake Mead and Rampart, it is a little tricky to find, but is worth the search. They describe themselves as a Thai tapas restaurant, implying there may be some fusion going on, but in actuality you can just expect a lot of Thai appetizers - really good Thai appetizers - and some traditional favorites. Most things on the menu taste healthy and clean, and there are plenty of vegetarian dishes. The tofu preparations here are better than most, and the eggplant dishes aren't heavily saturated with oil as they often can be.  You can't leave without ordering the unique Spinach Salad ($9). This isn't really a salad at all, but rather a mound of lightly tempura battered spinach leaves that serve as chips for a tangy 'dip' made from ground chicken, whole cashews, cilantro, carrots, and onions. The leaves are delicate, yet pack a crunch, and the spicy, sweet, loose dip is like a meat-fortified salsa. Sounds a little strange, but it's to die for. The Chicken Ginger Salad is similar to the Spinach Salad, except the spinach is replaced with iceberg lettuce, you get a lot more chicken, and you have the addition of tender julienne ginger ($9).  Skip on the 'Shrimp in Pastry.' Though tasty, and dramatically presented, there is no pastry to be found (just wonton wrappers). The shrimp are overwhelmed by the cream cheese, and the jalapeno and leek don't come through enough. It's also a culinary no-no to put inedible items on a plate, i.e. pineapple rind (see below). What the 'Shrimp in Pastry' lacked in cohesion of flavors, the 'Thai Bouillabaise' made up for, though the mucky color was off-putting. They also use frozen green lip New Zealand mussels, an ingredient I feel there is no excuse for in good places. Though I loved the broth, that was the break in the 'make-or-break' of the Bouillabaise for me.  I love that they have outdoor seating with views of the mountains in the distance, but the best kept part of Nittaya's secret is that you can get a $25 dining certificate on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for as little as $1 when you sign up for their email list. Although I'm annoyed by their almost daily notifications, the discount codes are incredible and I save about 80% off their regular restaurant certificate prices on any given day. Plus, it encourages me to try new restaurants I otherwise wouldn't, even if I do defeat the purpose of the discount entirely by over ordering. If you go to Nattaya's make sure you visit <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> beforehand, even if you don't have a code, because it will still save you $15 as a visitor.  Finally, go knowing that the service at Nittaya's is slow. Your food arrives promptly once you order, but everything else seems to take forever. The staff is friendly enough to compensate for this shortcoming, though it is worth taking into consideration if you are short on time or don't particularly like to linger. Hopefully this is just part of their opening pains.",

On my most recent visit we ordered Red curry chicken with brown rice (+$1) and stir fried mixed vegetables with white rice from the lunch special. There are 14 dishes on the lunch specials  menu to choose from and all come with both house salad and a pot sticker for $11...a very good deal for a clean establishment, with yummy food, in a nice setting.   As soon as you sit down, they will bring you cold, infused water with fruits and herbs...today it was with strawberry and cucumber...or you can go ahead order a glass of wine from their nice selection of wine.  I always try to make a reservation, even if it's two of us since Nittaya's Secret Kitchen's secret is out and well loved by locals.

We love tapas so he surprised me by taking me to this place today.  We had three small dishes: Golden Pouches that's potatoes inside an egg pastry with curry sauce, the potatoes was fresh and I like the curry sauce;  E-Saan Sausage which is pork sausage with lemongrass in it. I love the crispy pork belly. The pork belly was quite different the way they were prepared. It had a thicker breading but nonetheless they were so crispy and mouth watering.  The service was good.  We also enjoyed the hot teas. They have a separate hot menu so don't forget to check it out. They also have happy hour from 3-6, and half priced select bottles on Thursdays.  The only drawback is the place is very small with tables so close next to each other. We could hear all the conversation to our dislike. Anyhow, we enjoyed our lunch and experience.",

The decor is nicely appointed.   The menu is extensive so give your time to decide.   Our food was very fresh and made with care.     Hint.  If it's \"your thing\", check out how the better half live, drive around the surrounding area.  This secret kitchen appears to be in one of the best areas of Vegas.",

The wine selection is amazing, the food is always so fresh and mouthwatering. They always serve infused water, which here in the desert is so nice and satisfying as it refreshes you and cleanses your palate.  I am embarrassed to say that I am one of those that cannot handle too much spice when it comes to food, I have tried and tried to no avail...my friends and family have a running joke that even ice is too spicy :) for me.  Here they always listen to my request when I say p,ease make it a 0 with no spice and I have never been disappointed  My family likes the 5-8 spice range and they also are always satisfied.. if we share a dish they always split it and make sure that my \"ice\" spice is separate from the better seasoned (ha ha) Food.  We always get the same order and then try one new dish. Our favorite appetizers: chicken lettuce wraps, yummmmmmy .. they come in orders of 4 wraps and yes, the sauce is on the side, I can handle a little bit of it but you really don't need much sauce as the flavors are wonderful. The crispy spinach and the secret stickers or potstickers.  Main course we get an order of massaman curry Chicken with you guessed it, no spice  And the Basil chicken. Pineapple fried rice which is served inside half of the pineapple  They always bring extra spices for the table which is usually kept at the other end of the table. We also get one other dish to try each time and have never been disappointed with the experience   I usually pass when it comes to desert, my suggestion here... Don't! Their deserts melt in your mouth, the ice cream is creamy and yummy... the fried banana is done to perfection and the fried donuts are scrumptious.  This is a place that we go to often, yes it's in a strip mall (not a big deal)  but so adorably decorated.. it is a bit on the smaller side, but so worth the crowded feel..they do have patio dining I have never tried that but it looks comfy... they have excellent happy hour items and great offerings for happy hour.  Always a great meal.",

Food was good and the owner was around making sure everyone was happy. My husband wanted a lemonade and she heard when he asked the waiter. She quickly came to let us know they had their own home made lemonade (I think lavender) and we decided to go for it - it was delicious. They had no high chairs (I guess it is not really a kids place) but the tables are ok to sit kids at. We had both our kids in and while we were dining another family came in with 2-3 kids. We did not get any dirty looks :) Overall great experience and I hope to make it back soon without kids for more of a romantic meal.",

Opted for level 3 spice, which wasn't too spicy and would probably increase next time. The garlic rice with the chicken basil... you must try! The spinach tapas was really good along with the garlic edamame. There was no wait on a Sunday night at 7:00pm. Service was just okay. The server forgot one of our entree orders and bartender brought our bottled beers over, offered and suggested we use one of their cold beer glasses, we said yes.. then he never came back. It's okay though, it didn't change the fact that the food was delicious and I'd come back just to fulfill my Thai food fix!",

    "text": "Went to this place for lunch today and I am glad I did! This place is really a secret because it took me about 5-10 minutes of driving around the parking lot to find the place. The restaurant name is small so it is easy to miss, but place is located on the corner of the plaza with the dry cleaners.   Upon walking in, I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere. This place has a more upscale feel to it compared to other Thai restaurants. Kind of reminds me of a winery (and they do have quite the selection of white and red wine!).   I ended up ordering the massaman curry with chicken (I don't think you get to change the meat, but I didn't mind) which came with a small salad and one vegetable potsticker. The salad was really good because of the light dressing and the ingredients were a nice change from just the standard iceberg lettuce with carrots (they actually had cucumbers and some other veggies). The potsticker was really fresh and I really liked how the outer shell was crispy which gave a nice contrast to the contents. My curry was really good as well. The potatoes were fresh and had a strong flavor which I haven't really experienced in other restaurants. The chicken was nice and moist (not chewy like some other places) and the serving was pretty good considering the quality as well. I also ordered a glass of thai tea which was pretty good, but not the best that I've had.  Overall I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It has a nice, intimate atmosphere and the staff are really nice and attentive. Their water is also fancy! Today the water was infused with strawberry and some other fruit which I thought was pretty neat. I will be back to try some of the other dishes!   FYI, the lunch specials are around $11 which is a couple of bucks more than other places, but it is worth it! Do it and treat yourself.",

When we arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 5:30p, this very cute and intimate restaurant was pretty much empty. However, the host asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and said that he wouldn't be able to seat us because it was 1/2 priced wine night, and they'd fill up. Um..okay.... (looking around empty restaurant)... Well, can we sit at the bar? Long pause. How about outside? They hesitated, but said they'd set up one of the outside tables. That was a process that took awhile. Because it was a bit breezy outside, we asked if they could set up the outdoor space heater. Another process.  That finally being settled, we sat down at the somewhat shaky table.  From that point forward, things went well enough. The sangria is delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the fried avocado, the veggie potstickers and the mango bacon wrapped shrimp. All of these offerings were very good and again, the presentation was lovely. Service was friendly and pleasant.   As the evening progressed, the wind picked up, and even with the space heater, I was downright cold. I asked our server if it was possible to move us inside to finish. We went inside, and while it was busy, there was a small table right by the bar. She said that the reservation wasn't until 7, so we would have plenty of time to complete our meal. So...why weren't we just seated there in the first place?  The seating issues did put a bit of a damper on the meal, but I am willing to give Nittaya's another try.",

I also had a glass of Riesling to round out my lunch.  While it was nice outside and they have patio seating I sat at the bar for lunch.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Before I even ordered the bar tender had poured me a glass of their strawberry and cucumber infused water.   My order was taken and he poured me a little carafe of the wine and then poured half into the glass leaving the rest next to the glass.  The dumpling came out first and was a nice start.  the salad came out next closely followed by the main dish.  The only complaint I had was that the Pad Thai had a little too much soy sauce in it but it was still good.  I can definitely see myself coming back and trying some of the tapas and some more wine.",

    "text": "Yum! Came here for a late lunch, and just in time for happy hour, and it was delicious! It is a secret kitchen because from the outside, it looks dark -- almost like it's closed. There isn't an \"open\" sign, so at first, I actually thought that they were closed. The door also sticks a little bit, so you really have to yank hard to open the door. I thought that I was the only idiot to get tricked by this, but while sitting inside, it looked like several others were also fell for that trick! Guys, the secret is that Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is actually open!  I'm glad that I was able to make it for happy hour, as I got to try some of the appetizers. They definitely have more of the \"common\"/\"less exciting\" tapas on happy hour (e.g., dumplings), but I was satisfied with everything I ordered. For tapas, I shared the bacon wrap shrimp, the garlic edamame, and the fried avocados. You can't really go wrong with bacon-wrapped shrimp, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the shrimp. They definitely weren't shrimpy shrimp! The garlic edamame was REALLY good. It was really garlicy and had a nice kick to it! I think that they might have pan fried it, instead of steaming it, to give it an extra crisp. The fried avocado was really good! Again, most things are good when fried, but what really made it above and beyond was the cilantro sauce.  I also got the kao soi to share for an entree: the kao soi is really good! It's a bit pricey, but the portion is generous. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough to share, but there was plenty. The curry had a rich, spicy, coconut-y flavor, with a few large chunks of pork.  I ended up sitting at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and willing to make recommendations and help explain some of the items on the menu.  I would have loved to see some of their other more tapas on the happy hour menu.",

Everything we ordered on the menu was amazing! The pad thai, calamari, satay, pineapple fried rice and curry chicken was all delicious! They also have a wide variety of wine.  The mango sticky rice with coconut ice cream was a great finish to our meal. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family!",

    "text": "I hate writing a bad review but my experience was unpleasant and I felt compelled to vent.   First let me start off with the fact that it is New Year's Eve and the restaurant was packed and I placed a to go order.    The food is expensive for what it is, the portions are small but it tasted good (not amazing) based on the reviews I was expecting the best Thai meal of my life.  The total was $78.95 for potstickers, Bouillabaisse, Cornish hen, Pad Thai, bread pudding and fried banana.    I was told that my order would take 1 hour to be prepared but since this was my first time driving there I wanted to make sure I was there with enough time.  It only took me 7 minutes to get there - so here is the breakdown I placed my order at 5:51pm and I picked it up by 6:27pm hardly 1 hour.    The place was packed,  and the place is very well decorated.  I must say I'm a little bummed that I won't be returning because I really think I would have enjoyed my dinning experience there.  But coming from the service industry mistakes are all about the recovery.   Ok now on to the negatives, my chicken Pad Thai was missing I called them right away to let them know and they said I can come back pick it up.  At this point I just want to sit and eat so I called them back and said that I was going to eat my food first so it wouldn't get cold and I would call them when I'm on my way so they could re make it.  Ok so this where I think it just went down hill for me, my food was cold!!!  The portions are already small for the price but the being cold on top of it?!?!   The Bouillabaisse was tasty but cold, the Cornish hen was a  dry but tasty, the potstickers were a little  raw, the bread pudding was hard and the fried banana was soggy.  Just a really expensive bad meal.   So recovery--  hardly I call to them and stated that I just wanted my money back, the girl who answered the phone said she would give me a credit since they messed up, I told her that I most likely won't be returning and that I would like my money returned to my card.  She said that there wasn't a manager available tonight and she would take my information down and someone would reach out to me in the next couple of days.  As I was asking her for the managers name she had already hung up on me.  I tried calling back twice but no one answered.    So unfortunately I have to give this place 2 stars and I probably will never return.  I read so many things and so many friends have recommended it that it truly breaks my heart that I am the one who had a bad experience.  Update went back last night to get my refund and a manager never came to talk to me, they took my card gave me the refund and ushered me out, no apologies.  I know that one bad review will affect the place but hopefully this won't happen to anyone else.",

This place is just very clean, great fresh food and beautifully served. The detail is everything when they serve the meal. They are always very busy so make sure to make a reservation before going.

    "text": "Finally made it in! It was worth the wait!   I had tried to dine here previously but it was just too  busy. I did my due diligence and made a resi this time. The process was pleasant.   Our reservation was respected and we were promptly seated. It was packed and service was notably slow. We were in no hurry so this was not an issue. I believe it was at least 30 mins before we even ordered apps. Plates were promptly cleared and water always filled so we were not abandoned but we barely saw our actual server.   We had mussels, volcano shrimp, soft shell crab, and sausage. The mussels were life changingly good. The coconut broth was divine. They were perfectly tender and I literally ate remainder of the broth with a spoon. The sausage was pungent with lemongrass and very tasty. It was served in whole sausages but with all the fixings to make lettuce wraps. Yum. The shrimp were cooked nicely and tasty but nothing special. The soft shell crab was delightful.   We had the signature fried spinach salad which was tasty and unique.   We had the duck curry and avocado strip steak with green curry. I didn't dislike the duck but would not order it again. The combination of lychee, pineapple, tomato and curry ultimately did not work for me. I think warm pineapple freaks me out a little. The steak was phenomenal. The avocado, eggplant, zucchini and green curry were all perfect. The curry was the perfect thickness and texture. Absolutely delicious.   We had a bottle of wine and our bill was just over $200 for 4 of us. We were uncomfortably full. My co diners had a dessert and a glass of dessert wine. I didn't partake. I would return tomorrow and order the mussels and steak and refuse to share.   Go try this upscale yet affordable Thai treasure.",

    "text": "The BF and I went here for date night last week and we had a great experience. This restaurant is located in our neighborhood and so we thought we would give it a try. The ambiance is well decorated, cozy and nice. Good for a dinner where you'd like to have conversation and not have to talk loudly. We had the deep fried spinach salad which lived up to the hype of being a signature dish here. We split that as an appetizer, and we ordered the Kow Soi noodle entree. Our server mentioned that the entrees are big, so that should be enough for the both of us. And she was right. This entree was HUGE! Prices were a little more than your average Thai place, but you get your money's worth. We were too full for dessert but the items looked great.   The only area of improvement I would suggest is that in the main dining room there is a huge chalkboard mentioning happy hour, yet we were told it was only available in the bar area. I would suggest maybe not posting it in the dining room as we were confused as why it would be in there and not maybe featured near the bar area. Just my two cents. Happy hour ends at 6pm and when we asked at our table they mentioned it was over and only in the bar. (The time was 5:50pm). Again, just a preference to ensure a great dining experience. Other than that, it was really good and we can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I needed a girl's night out. I had never been here but had read good reviews.  It was a small place with less then 15 tables and a bar area. There is a tapas menu as well as a dinner menu.  We arrived around 4:45pm on a Friday evening- they did ask if we had a reservation (we didn't) but they said they could seat us anyways.   They wine menu is not large, but some well chosen bottles. They started us with a strawberry cucumber water- very unexpected and refreshing drink.  We ordered a bottle of wine and some tapas plates to try different things since everything sounded good. We ended up with the garlic edamame, secret dumplings, Phuket poppers and steak skewers.  The garlic edamame were phenomenal.  I foresee ordering these for takeout often!!  The steak was good- nothing to write home about and the dumplings and poppers were delicious.  The portions were good size for tapas, but we still decided we wanted something a little more. We ordered the Pad Z U (pad see eww) from the dinner menu. It was delicious as well.    The edamame was reason alone to come back, but the dishes that others ordered look delicious as well.  Thrilled to have found this hidden gem of a restaurant and look forward to my next visit!!",

Altough the decor might be called intimate, it appeared a little to dark for my taste, with black table linen. Service was excellent though and restrooms were immaculaty clean. The food was tasty, but not extraordinary. Avocado rolls were delicious, but so are those at other places (Cheesecake factory, BJ's in Henderson). The spinach salad was fried, but that was our mistake as we did not check. Komol serves a similar dish that is just as good. Drunken noodles (flat noodles with ground chicken and veggies), was great, although Dangee Thai on Pecos makes them better.  Overall a very enjoyable lunch but the Eastside of town has just as many enjoyable places. Komol is great, but StickErice is still my favorite Thai!  Update: I received a nice email back from the owner, explaining some of the dishes I tried and I really appreciated the effort. It showed they really care about their food and their customers. Maybe a second try might be worth it when I am in Summerlin.",

The seared tuna tapas was wonderful and dinner of skirt steak avocado curry and garlic saffron rice was amazing!

Let me just preface this by saying that I've been around my share of delicious Thai restaurants.  I mean, I'm from Hawaii, where we have an abundance of delicious Asian cuisine and Thai food restaurants galore.  With that said, I have to tell you that this place is a little gem.  Everything from the decor of the place where it has a nice, intimate setting yet plays pretty hip background music, to their furniture and coziness...just adds to the experience.    I've had some dishes here that I have never had any any other Thai restaurant.  Sure they have your typical pad thai or Tom Yum Soup but the delicious tempura spinach salad was truly magical.

    "text": "Wow! This is not a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai palace! I am originally from Vancouver BC, and this is the first time I have experienced authentic, delicious Thai food since I left that city!! And on top of it- it's a wine bar!! I was in heaven! My husband and I ordered the fried spinach which came with a spicy/fish sauce dip (delicious). It was an unexpected treat, so tasty!! Warning- it's enough for four people, so it was a big dish for the two of us! We also had a dried rib appetizer, which was very good. The big surprise was their curried avocado salmon. OMG!! Out of this world! The ambience was super cozy, clean and beautiful decor... right down to the fresh exotic flower popping out of wine crates. Very friendly, knowledgeable service. The menu was very extensive, and good wines by the glass. So excited to find this gem! Can't wait to go back, and we will be back a lot!! I LOVE Las Vegas!!!",

I know it's selfish and wrong of me to think about not telling people how great this little restaurant is, in fear of not getting a table, but that  would be so wrong of me.

    "text": "This place is about 20 minute or so away from the strip. I been searching and wanting to try something different in Vegas. This came up in my search and decided to bookmark it to try. I ended up making reservations about two weeks in advance. It was really busy when we got there so it is better to have one than have to wait.   The parking was super easy. I really like the feel of the place. Nothing too fancy, kind of remind me of a regular Thai place.   What we ordered:  World famous spinach salad-this thing was so good. It was just spinach tempura but the sauce is so good. It has a little kick to it. The spice and the limey taste really made the dish stand out.   Crab roll-these were good. I thought the price was kind of high for the four rolls we got, however, they were yummy.   Salmon-Avocado Curry-I really enjoys this dish. It had a green curry with a big piece of salmon with eggplant, zucchini, and avocado. You can change it to any protein you like. I decided to stick to the salmon cause that's what they are known for. This was worth the $24 price tag.   Crying Tiger Steak-grilled rib eye steak was just okay. We would pass on this dish next time.   Service-Great   Overall, I would come back for the spinach salad again!",

Here are the things I've tried so far:  Spinach appetizer: duh, get it, listen to your fellow yelpers. So. Good. I dream about this. I want to know whatever the dipping sauce is made of, because it's life.  Calamari lime/chili (not sure what it's called, but it's on the tapas menu: naked calamari with tasty marinade, red onions, cilantro ....just be careful or you might eat lemongrass   Panang curry beef: super good, no surprises if you had it at other Thai places  Beef jerky: better than most run-of-the-mill Thai places. The ginger dipping sauce is legit.   Pork w chili and green beans: my brother ordered it, not something I would order but very tasty   Basil eggplant lunch special: slightly sweet, tender eggplant with onions.  $12 lunch specials come with a salad, white rice, and potsticker. Good deal, as honestly if I only came for this I could make 2 meals out of it for myself.   I will keep coming back to try things but I will never pass up that spinach.",

The coconut chicken soup is terrific.  However on our last few visits we've noticed a slight change in quality. The steak with green curry and avocado has changed from a nice large piece of sliced flank steak to strips of what seems to be lesser quality meat like chuck or round.  Why only thee stars? The service has been consistently lacking. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the kitchen or servers placing the order.  On our last visit we ordered soup and ribs plus separate entrees for all. We were just starting to eat the soup when the ribs arrived. Ok not a big deal. Then the server immediately returned with the entree plates and started shoving our appetizers to the side to make room for the entrees which were coming out of the kitchen!  We told them to take them back to the kitchen where I'm sure they sat under a heat lamp.  I know that people were waiting to be seated but there is more to a good meal than the food. We don't want to be rushed out the door within 45 minutes.   Maybe they should stop over booking.",

We were quite disappointed in the food though.  We ordered the following dishes:  1.) fried calamari. The crumb coat of the calamari was not adherent to the calamari. The crispy exterior was as if it has fallen off the calamari. It was very disappointing as when you want to eat friend calamari you look forward to biting into a tender crunchy ring. Instead we got calamari with a lot of loose fried breading on top which was very disappointing  2) Drunken Noodles- was very salty. A few bites in and it tasted as if I was just eating and overwhelming amount of soy sauce. Other than the large amount of saltiness, the Thai basil was flavorful to the dish   3) Massaman Chicken Curry with potatoes - the curry was ok. The favors were not as prominent as they could have been. I feel like the curry paste they used needed some more flavor. The chicken was over cooked and the potatoes were undercooked.   Overall, considering the price we paid and the lack of quality of the food we were disappointed.",

A lot of \"Thai Food\" restaurants but mostly are just your average Chinese places with a little basil here and some curry there and bada bing! They claim it's Thai. False.   The food is amazing. We took an adventure off the strip for more of a stereotypical meal opposed to a casino full of smoke and hook pieces. Was not disappointed. The tapas selection was robust and the servings were large enough that we could've taken an entire meal home had we not been staying in a casino / hotel.   I'd honestly stay in Summerlin just to go to this place again!  Bravo!",

We tend to stay away from dishes that aren't anything special and that we can get elsewhere for much cheaper (like pad Thai).    We do enjoy the Grilled Salmon-Avocado Curry (in green curry with eggplant, avocado, & zucchini), Fried Spinach, Eggplant with Thai Basil, & Garlic-Basil Lamb Chop.   Give it a try.

This appetizer is so good you want to rub it all over yourself, but won't unless you want to end up in jail.   The decor is tasteful and modern reflecting the Thai fusion style of the restaurant. The wait staff and knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.   We had the drunken noodles and the  the coconut seafood curry. Both dishes were delicious, with complex, rich, and spicy flavors. The drunken noodles were tasty, different, and unique with the addition of basil and Chinese broccoli. The coconut seafood curry was an amazing combination of fish, shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops in a sumptuous curry sauce, just flat out fantastic!",

I did not and although the place was busy she stayed very calm and friendly while getting a table prepared for us.  It being Father's Day it was busier than normal for a Sunday night I suppose. We had tapas, a rice dish followed by a desert. Everything was very nice, nice ambiance, nice food, nice waitstaff. Best experience so far of any restaurant in the area! Recommended! I would suggest calling ahead for a table as it's a small place. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Nittaya's is very good, but with Thai food price is very important to me.  I don't think any dish should ever be more than $12 unless there's crab or duck or some expensive protein in there.  You can find outstanding Thai food in Chinatown or Eastside for less than $20 for a full meal.  At Nittaya's you struggle to find an item on the menu for less than $20.  Even the salads are almost $15.    Now that I got the price issue out of the way, I'll say that the venue is quite nice and romantic.  The staff is great and there is even a nice outdoor area.  The food was hit or miss for me. The chicken panang curry was outstanding.  But the bok choy wasn't even cut in the dish.  The chef just threw an entire piece of vegetable, root and all, into the dish so we had to cut it ourselves.  The dish could also have been better with more veggies and less chicken in my opinion, but it was tasty nonetheless.  The papaya salad was a nice dish and had a good kick.  The drunken noodles with chicken were fresh.  The chicken had a nice larb taste to it and the noodles were slimy as I like them.  I don't think I'll be back.  Way too expensive when I can go to Chada, Arawan, Lotus, etc. and get a better quality meal for 2/3 of the price.",

For our entrees we got the salmon avocado curry and garlic basil lamb chops. Sooo flavorful! Although we were pretty full we decided that since we don't know when the next time is that we'll be able to stop by, we might as well try their dessert too. It was mango coconut rice with Thai mangos that are only in season for a few months. Next time I want to try the banana chocolate beignets!   Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with everything. Food, atmosphere, and service. I would definitely suggest this to others.",

I then placed it on the tablecloth next to me to give to your server. We did not expect you to comp the entire meal. We did expect you not to try and charge us for the dish with the hair in it. Not only did you charge for the dish, you offered us a free dessert and yes, we ordered two. So what did you do? You gave us the cheaper one for $7.00 and charged us for the dish that cost $12.00. The right thing to do would have have been for you, the chef/owner to come out, apologize and make it right. We have enjoyed our other meals at your restaurant and have recommended it to our friends. This kind of experience leaves a really bad impression and does not excite us to come back or recommend you. With such a small venue, it seems to me that you would want your customers be leave happy. As an aside, my dish was shrimp with baby bok choy as was my daughters. Both dishes came with broccoli (substitute) , with no discussion or notice from the server! Sincerely, the mother who had the grey hair in her mouth.\"",

    "text": "The restaurant is rather small and constricted in space for the tables but we managed to squeeze in one of those side tables but another customers chairback was right up against mine. The menu resembled a clipboard with a number of papers attached. Half the menu was dedicated to the food and half  dedicated to wines. our interests were focused on the Chinese dishes advertised and those were presented as tapas rather than like dim sum which in a Chinese restaurant they would've been. We ended up having three tapas plates and one entree dish. Each of the Tapas plates were tasty and imaginative. The entree was a smartly presented dish of fried rice with pineapple chicken onions and cashew nuts. I think the key to the Tapas dishes is to make sure you have the proper sauces to accompany it with. In most cases, the default sauce worked well but I would recommend asking them for whatever other kinds of sauces you happen to prefer like a soy sauce or a hot sauce. The entree dish was a pineapple fried rice with chicken onions and cashew nuts. The dish was presented in a pineapple half shell which allowed you to take it home and eat the remaining Fried rice and cut some additional pineapple from the edge. My wife loved it. in closing, I would recommend coming early because it appears to be a very popular nighttime get together place. It's a little pricey with each of the Topos dishes being about $10 each and the entrees between 11 and $18. I will be coming again!",

    "text": "If there is any one cuisine that I would say I could be considered a reputable critic on, it would have to be Thai food.  My fiance and I visit at least once a year and I lived there for a short time a couple years ago, while doing a scuba diving internship.  I've taken a coupe cooking classes  there as well, with a wonderful teacher named Miss Ya.  I'm very fond of a couple dishes that I learned during my first course, one is one of the spiciest dishes there is....PAPAYA SALAD!  And seems to be showing up on more and more on menus here in Vegas recently and the other is Massaman Curry, and we get both almost every time we eat Thai.    After reading about this place in the Weekly and then reading the reviews on here, I've been wanting to go.  Two of my favs, Thai & Tapas, YEA!  Our first impression, like a few others have mentioned, is that the decor was a little off.  After careful consideration, we decided that we should offer to donate some of our Thai artwork, perhaps in exchange for some food, lol!   Anyway, here's what we got: Papaya salad- my fiance even commented on it being quite authentic Lemongrass soup- was pretty tasty, but I needed to spice it up some more with leftover papaya salad juice :-)) Massaman Curry- we both thought it was savory and had very good quality ingredients.  Although it could've been spicier and we were never asked what level of spiciness we wanted on anything. Spinach Salad - I had to save the best for last even though we ate this before the curry.  It was simply AMAZING!  If you go here, you have to get this!  SERIOUSLY, this is not to be missed!      Overall, the food was all pretty darn good and I will definitely call in orders, but the atmosphere is a little funky, however we'll see if we can't help change that :-).     Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I LOVE the fact that they serve fruit infused water, nice touch!",

I mean, it's a tapas place.  You've got a large group of people.  So of course you're going to order a lot of different dishes.  So we got the fried tofu, the fried avocado, the summerlin rolls (chicken), the fire cracker prawns, the steamed mussels, the famous spinach salad and some salmon dish that I don't see on the menu now.  What was interesting.  The spinach salad was really interesting.  It's like tempura spinach with a dipping sauce on the side.  Really unique taste.  And I've never had crunchy potato-chip like spinach.  So it's pretty fun to eat.  The mussels weren't bad.  The sauce it was cooked in was a little bland but the mussels were perfectly cooked.  Fried tofu is good.  But I love fried tofu.  But then again, the fired tofu's not amazing.  The fried avocado is different.  Not bad.  Never had fried avocado so if you like avocado-I definitely recommend it.  The salmon dish was possibly the best thing we had.  Excellent.  Made me wonder if ordering tapas might have been the wrong way to go.  So what was terrible?  The summerlin rolls.  Garbarge.  The fire cracker prawns, almost tasteless.  Pricey.  Worth it?  Meh.  Food wasn't bad but I wouldn't go back.  Too many misses and not enough hits.",

Two of my favs, together for the first time? The thought was blissful enough for me to trek it up to Summerlin for a taster (well, the intrigue of thai tapas and, of course, my fab book club!) Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.... but maybe it was because my expectations were set too high.   The venue itself is a bit of a surprise... the dark, somewhat seductive decor and lighting are nice... but don't really spring to mind when you think thai tapas.   Service was extremely slow, though the servers themselves (two servers kept trading responsibilities throughout the night) were very nice.   The food itself was hit or miss. Hits: White Fish Cake (the dipping sauce was awesomeness), the mango coconut rice (the bomb), and a visit by the chef/owner to our table at the end of our meal. Misses: Papaya Salad (especially after tasting some of the other fantastic papaya salads that Vegas has to offer), Panko-crusted avocado, and crab wanton (oil factor was out of control).  We tried several other tapas which were MEH.    To be fair, we went when this resto was only a few months old... so, maybe the kinks have been worked out since I dined there. I hope so because the concept itself gets 1 star!",

    "text": "I was in the Summerlin neighborhood, and had this spot bookmarked, so thought I would give it a try!  I've read earlier reviews, and it looks like they have established themselves nicely now.  The interior is very upscale, which wine glasses and fancy wood furniture.  The dining area is small, but nicely designed.  Wine bottles are fancily displayed in wooden shelves behind the bar.  There is even a small outside dining area, which might be nice on a summer night.  The easy listening music would have touched my inner yuppie, if I had one.  I had no issues with the service.  I made a bit of small talk with one of the waitresses, and she explained that Nittaya's has only been open for two months.  My water was always full, and they asked me how my food was.  This also was the first Thai restaurant I've been to where the waitress folded my napkin over my lap.  I wasn't even with anyone!  Can't complain there.   My order: Thai tea, Crab Wontons, and Curry catfish.   Overall impression: descent, Americanized Thai.  Thai tea was average, very creamy, but not very flavorful.  I would go ahead and skip the Thai tea at Nittaya's.  The water though had fruit in it!  This is how my old stoming grounds, Thai Grill, does their water, and it makes for a very refreshing, slightly tangy drink.    The Crab Wontons were a little bland on the inside.  They used some sort of either immitation crab, or low quality crab, mixed with cream cheese and a couple of herbs.  The fried shells were nice though, thick and well prepared.   They came with two sauces, a sweet sauce and a spicy one.  Both were good sauces, particularly the spicy one, and they made the crab wontons definitely more doable.  Overall though, I wasn't too impressed.    The curry catfish was alright.. not great, not bad though.  The curry sauce was thick, and on the sweet side, but in this case that was ok because catfish is always a little better with sweetness to offset the \"dry\" catfish taste.  The portion was a little small for the $13 price tag.  The curry came with a nice change of pace though: baby bok choy.  This did give the curry a little bit of a unique taste, I and enjoyed it.    Overall, due to the sweetness of the curry, and the not-so-thrilling crab wontons, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Nittaya's again over some of the better, more authentic Thai restaurants in Vegas (see my List), but it would be a good spot to bring a date or the parents maybe.",

You have to eat the salad with sticky rice, with your fingers....it's the only way in my opinion. Do it. It was perfect! The perfect amount of peanuts and spice. In love- so happy. I ordered the pad Thai, because---u just have to. And it was great- although I could only eat a few bites. Too stuffed from the salad. I am looking forward the trying the mango/coconut dessert and some curry dishes. When I first started eating Thai food those were the best...all I ever ate.

I've tried curry which they ask between 1-5 and we had a 5 (which my friend asked for a thai 5 not a white guy's 5, since he's had some places skimp thinking he can't handle it) and it wasn't that spicy at all.  Although he did get the Duck Curry, which too spicy might overpower the dish.  So it's understandable.  My other friend got a 3 tofu curry.  TO DIE FOR!  I loved it and I am normally not a curry fan.  Although eatting a whole dish by myself I don't know (that's just not my dish nothing against the food)  I prefer Pad Thai.  They have tofu and chicken, but we asked for Duck.  They made it for us.  It was heaven! I would ask them to make it again!    They also have wine there...and are pretty knowledgeable and will let you try some of the wine if you were interested in trying it.  ((We spent more in wine than our dishes...we had 7 people and our bill ended up being 150 for food and 170 for wine))  I say with that many people, it was a good deal :)",

The place is very pretty nice atmosphere, the owner and chef happened to stop by are table we  where telling her we are enjoying the taste treats, she said she uses her mother's recipes and also adds her own style to the dishes. I would definitely be going back maybe bring some of my friends on girls night out!!",

I tried the fried avocados, not as amazing, the curries are delish! The restaurant is small and doesn't have a lot of tables so if you go on a Friday/Saturday be prepared to wait... but its so worth it!",

On a recent Thursday night we arrived there a little early,  which was a good thing since its a small restaurant with few tables that really fills up.  Our waiter was very helpful with the complex menu.  Her recommendations which included the fried spinach didn't disappoint,  the food was great.  The prices good, and the portions ample.  The atmosphere was also lovely, so unexpected from the outside.   We will defiantly make this a neighborhood regular",

The service is top notch, the decor is beautiful, and the aroma of fresh flowers only adds to the ambiance.

You can see from my other reviews I'm not so easy to please.  They do an excellent job of taking spices and adding flavors that are new and delicious without over doing it. I can't wait to try other things on their menu. This trip we tried the spinach salad (what a shock it's so good), the chicken masaman, the eggplant curry, a noodle dish that was top notch and the Phucket poppers (the most disappointing and still excellent).  If I had one complaint it's time to replace the chairs unless it's just the one I had. It was extremely uncomfortable. No reason to downgrade restaurant, just a note. A little cramped, but hey, what can you do. It's excellent food, popular and limited in size. I own a restaurant and hope that my customers enjoy my shop as much as I enjoyed this one. I can't say enough about it. Thank you for a great night out.",

    "text": "#latereview 08/09/2015  I enjoyed my time more being with friends than being here. I will give them a chance again but for now I have other go to places for Thai.  Now I know going in that I should be more prepared and check to see if reservations were needed. My friend suggested this place without a reservation. So we ended up being sat at the bar. No worries there. Completely our fault.  To start off the dinner with friends I ordered my usual papaya salad. Theirs had shrimp so I said why not? I enjoyed the flavor more than the dish itself. The dressing was on point, but the usual crispness that you would expect from a green papaya was just not there. The peanuts did lend to the crunchiness but it was not the same. I appreciate seafood but for some reason to me it did not pair well with the salad. I don't know how the shrimp was handled during preparation but it did not have a good texture. Like it sat too long in the dressing maybe? It was just off putting. I didn't get sick after the dinner so I'm not saying the shrimp was spoiled, but it did not have the usual characteristic of something fresh.   The Duck Breast Curry was okay. Well, better than okay. I appreciated the fact that it was a duck breast which meant no bones to pick through, but it was just not the same as other duck curries I've had at other restaurants.   By the time I got to the dessert, I was impressed by the presentation... Then this happened. This is more of the chef in me so I don't know if it goes unnoticed by most people, but seeing that same garnish (purple edible orchids) throughout all my courses... I think it's enough. Yes there's a time and place for it but not through every single course.   All in all, I felt the food was okay. Would I go back? I would not actively do it but if friends suggested it I will still go.",

    "text": "WOW!!  This was our first visit to this restaurant, and we were amazed at the food, the service, and the ambiance.  The dining area is cozy and intimate without feeling crowded.  I've never eaten Thai food this good.  Each dish tasted freshly-prepared, was garnished beautifully, and had a tasty sauce served with it.  We started with the lemongrass soup - it was fragrant, well-seasoned, and had many large, perfectly-cooked shrimp in it.  We decided to stick with the tapas - the soft-shell crab was perfectly-cooked and served with a bright, crunchy apple salad - the perfect pairing.  I can also highly recommend the ribs and the coconut shrimp.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  We'll be regulars here, and next time I will save room for dessert!",

    "text": "TL;DR Don't get the drunken noodle. Don't get any noodles. Stick to fried rice or curry. Get the world famous spinach salad, but stay away from the thai ice tea.  This place for me was meh for me. Everything was great until I had the thai ice tea then it started going downhill.    World Famous Spinach Salad: Rating: 5/5 The best part of the meal. Really good. If you com here, you have to get the world famous spinach salad. Come with an appetite as it will fill you up. Who knew spinach would be so good deep fried.   Thai Ice Tea Rating 2/5 I expected better. It came in a wine glass instead of a tall glass. Honestly it wasn't that great, but at least it wasn't fake thai tea made from powder. I always get thai ice tea as it is a staple drink for any thai place. Meh #1.  Crying Tiger Steak Rating: 4/5 The sauce was very good with the steak. Medium rare. I feel like one of the best thing here is the sauce.  Drunken Noodle Rating: 1/5 Honestly this ruined my entire dining experience. Not only did it come out last and late compared to the crying tiger steak, but it was soggy and falling apart. I would stick a fork into the noodle and it would fall apart from it's own weight. Not only that, it was too salty, and the sauce flavor destroyed the entire dish. The only thing you could taste was the salty sauce. I talked to a waiter about it and he said it should be like that. What it tastes like is like leftover drunken noodle plates were recycled and recooked into my plate with some extra sauce to cover up the recooking process. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. He might die from the sodium overload.",

    "text": "The \"Not So Secret Salad\" is one of my favorite salads in town! It's more of an interpretation than an actual salad, but I don't let that pesky detail get in the way. The dish is tempura-fried spinach leaves with a sweet-and-spicy dressing slash dipping sauce. You can dip the leaves as you go and eat it like nachos, or dump on the dressing and attempt to use a fork. Either way, your taste buds will be quite delighted. You can share this as an app or order it as your main, like I do.  Nittaya's Secret Kitchen has $11 lunch specials that include a salad and potsticker, as well as a Happy Hour (Mon-Thurs, 3-6PM). The Not So Secret Salad is also $11 though, so I find myself ordering that instead of branching out to try new things.  Small neighborhood place, classy decor and local art, lots of wines available. They have a small section of patio seating, and some day I'll actually try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "I enjoyed Nittaya's Thai on many levels...   Food.  Not strictly traditional Thai, as some of the dishes are made with a twist off of traditional dishes, but tasty nonetheless.  Great portions at reasonable prices.  Each of our items, including the spinach salad could've easily served four.    Loved the cozy, modern back dining room.    Very nice servers.  Being new employees here, a couple of new servers didn't have the answer to several of our detailed questions, but repeatedly said they would go back and get the answers for us.  They did. All servers should be trained to provide this kind of service!  Management here knows how to both hire and train well.    And the food...  Spinach Salad - This is unlike any spinach salad you've ever had.  Firstly, don't mistakenly think for even a moment that this \"salad\" is going to be a healthy option.  That said, it's really delicious, and one of the non-traditional Thai items with a twist. Each individual spinach leaf is perfectly deep fried in a light tempura batter, and this massive mound of fried spinach tempura is served with a light fish sauce you can use as \"salad dressing\".  The fish sauce dressing is more like something you'd find at a Vietnamese restaurant, but was really a perfect super light topping for the delicately individually fried pieces of spinach.  Frying each of the individually tempura dipped spinach leaves sounded like such a labor intensive dish, that I had to order it.  I didn't devour it like a salad, but rather as an appetizer, dipping the pieces of spinach into the fish sauce.  They're addicting and would be a great appetizer for a crowd.    Vegetarian Green Curry - You can select a spice level between 1-5.  We asked for a 3, and it was perfect.  Definitely spicy, but not so crazy hot that you can't actually taste the food, and end up blowing your nose like you have a bad cold.  The portion was huge, and could've easily served four.  It was a tad saltier than I would've preferred, but I really enjoyed the curry, which was on the creamier side.  The eggplant and tofu were both delicious.  I would've appreciated more tofu though, as they were cut into pretty darn tiny pieces.   Thai Doughnuts - Just had to try these, as I've never had Thai doughnuts.  That said, I wouldn't get them again.  They were nicely fried, but somewhat dense, and nothing like I imagined a doughnut to be.  Unless you like your doughnuts completely drenched in sugar, ask for the caramel sauce on the side.   It's always a great feeling to leave the restaurant wanting to try other dishes you've eyed on the menu, or on a neighboring table.  This was that kind of a place for us, so we definitely plan on returning.",

My coworkers ordered the spinach salad and the pork bellies and I had a bite of both. Let's just say that I will be ordering both of those dishes when I go back. For dessert I finished up with the Island Sunday Fool and it tasted like Heaven. The staff were friendly and provided excellent service. I can't wait to take my boyfriend to this delightful little place.",

They have been busy each time, but I've gotten lucky in snagging a seat without having to wait.   The tempura spinach wasn't everyone's favorite as it is a little heavy, but the fish sauce it's served with is really good. The crab fried rice was perfect, and I wish I lived closer so I could order it daily.   As the man-friend pointed out, it's not a place where the portions are small so that you can order a few appetizers AND and entree and still have room to finish it all. Doesn't mean I don't do it...just sayin' the portions are pretty generous. Aside from everything being really amazing,  the bread pudding was the perfect way to end the meal.   Highly recommend, would come back!!",

Very dark, chic and kind of romantic.  The service was pretty good.  We ordered fairly quickly and we were never lacking for water.  The food came out quickly with the exception of one dish that basically came after we were done eating.  Now lets get to the food.  Very high quality with intense flavors.  The entrees and tapas are expensive but you get quite a bit for your buck and seriously the flavor is so good you won't care how much it costs.  The spinach salad is a must have.  YOU MUST GET THIS.  The sauce it comes with I could drink.  The mussels are pretty good too.  We added the coconut sauce it comes with to our soup, it was so good.  I did not like the homemade ice cream.  It was flavorful but very icy and grainy.    Definitely worth a try.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Thanks to my sister for this recommendation. My fiance and I came here for lunch this time around at 1pm in the afternoon. Only a few others were here, and the perfect time to take  your time to eat. If you plan on coming in for dinner highly recommend to make reservations as they get packed.   For our second visit, I noticed the menu is more expansive. They do have lunch specials going for $11 with salad and chicken potsticker from 11am-3pm. The rest of the menu has appetizers, tapas, entrees, a huge list of wine, cocktails, and alcohol and desserts.   What we ordered: the famous spinach salad w/the lime sauce, thai beef jerky w/the green sauce  (beware, this green sauce is soooo addicting), pork belly w/the spicy chilli sauce, shrimp, secret stickers (basil chicken flavored) and the muay thai fried rice. Everything we ordered came mostly off of the tapas menu and the muay thai fried rice we decided to get from the dinner menu.   Everything we tasted has been the best thai food we have tasted in so long.  Spinach salad is enough to feed a party of 4 to 5 ppl. Spinach also has been perfectly cooked. Adding the lime sauce adds a bit of the kick. Definitely recommend for first timers. Pork belly with the chilli sauce and the pork was tender. This is the thai version of the Filipino version of lechon. Shrimp was on point with the chilli sauce. The chicken basil pot stickers, were different. Crunchy on the outside and juicy, tender when you bite right into it. Last, the fried rice was fluffy and evenly seasoned and enough to feed a whole family.  The service: by far one of the best. They were attentive, suggested other options, on point with refills.   Overall: we enjoyed our service and definitely recommend if you want to enjoy dinner or lunch. Will be back soon.",

My husband loves their Phuket poppers, with shrimp jalapenos and cream cheese. The main course has all the traditional Thai curries, very good portions. I ordered spicy basil tofu and it was excellent.  Every Thursday they do half price wine by the bottle. They have a select menu to choose from and has a really good selection of wines. You can get a nice bottle of Chardonnay (original price $36 for $18!!) it's a steal.  The service is always awesome. For extra heat I request their Thai chilies which the staff is happy to serve.",

It's packed lunch and dinner. Attention to detail here is world class! We love Nittaya's so much that it is our regular \"date\" place.",

All of our dishes were delicious and well presented. The selections were vast quite interesting. The Spinach Salad was very unique and delicious. The beef jerky, the pork belly and Thai fried rice were all delicious. Our entrees were all delicious.

    "text": "I have long been a fan of Las Vegas' Lotus of Siam, often cited as the top Thai restaurant in the US. Years ago a friend recommended, Nittaya's Secret Kitchen... and I discovered the West Side's best kept secret.  Nittaya is located at Lake Mead and Rampart and is a west side local favorite. The decor is thoughtful and warm with wood and fabrics and an intimate even romantic feel. The restaurant feels small with two adjacent dining rooms and a wine bar.  The food is undeniably delicious with the usual variety of a top notch Thai restaurant. As good of Thai food as I have ever had, including Lotus and Thailand! While I dine here alone at the bar or as a couple often, I prefer going with a group so I can over order and get deeper in the menu.  My favorites are the citrus steak salad and the Kao Soi. The FOB pineapple rice is a great addition to any meal and the chicken dumplings are excellent. Actually, everything is delicious.  The service is warm and friendly, Josh has been there for years providing exceptional service. Thank you!  The wine list is decent, I highly recommend a bottle of Reisling to compliment your meal. Try the Schloss or Monchoff. Thursday, they have 1/2 off wine bottles.",

The decor is beautiful and I'm the type of person who really appreciates the little details like fresh flowers at each table and complimentary infused water.  The food is fantastic, packed with bold flavors. I'm a big fan of the sweet & sour coconut soup, pineapple fried rice served in an actual pineapple and the famous spinach salad! I could drink the dipping sauce straight for the salad! I also appreciate that every dish is so beautifully prepared.   Prices are higher here and of course you could get cheaper Thai food but no other Thai place looks like this one. It's about the overall experience here and it's a great one.",

    "text": "I found myself in Nittaya's the other day after asking Siri for Thai nearby me.  I have lived in this area for almost 8 years, and I am embarrassed to say I have never stopped by.  I stopped in and placed an order for take out, but was immediately taken back by the very intimate and sophisticated interior decor.  I know Thai, and this was much more White Orchid. Very classy, very inmate.    For sure, there were still classic Thai accouterments adoring the walls, but it was not overdone.  I really wish I could rate the wine bar, because it looked above-average, and who doesn't want to rate a wine bar?   I can rate two things: a few of the dishes and the service I received.   I ordered Curry in Young Coconut, Basil Beef, and Tofu Pad Thai (always have to try the Pad).  The Basil Beef was excellent (similar preparation to Mint Beef), sweet and savory.  The Pad Thai was also excellent.  Not overdone, not too sauced, and the waitress asked if the included egg was OK - as a Tofu dish, I could see how egg may put some people off and this was a nice touch.     The Curry Coconut?  Oh my.  It was the perfect dish. Amazing curry spice sauce, mussels, clams, scallops, and whitefish all roasted inside a coconut.  My son hasn't stopped talking about it for two days.  This is a definite must-do.  The service was very polite and professional and did not lack.    I can't wait to go back after finding this gem for a proper sit-in dinner.  Maybe I will get  to review the wine bar, too.  For the sake of review only, of course.  I'm holding off on 5 (or 3) stars until I get a full sit-in experience.",

I love spinach.  And I love anything deep fried.  It is a match made in heaven.    I met a friend for lunch here and upon entering we were impressed with the elegant and serene atmosphere. We decided to start off with the spinach salad to share, and each ordered from the $11 lunch menu.    I now understand why this spinach salad is \"world famous\".  It was delicious.  Perfectly crispy, and the larb/lime dressing that accompanied it was fantastic.  I would eat salads (even non deep fried ones) everyday if I could pour that dressing on it.    I ordered the Basil Eggplant and it also came with a small salad a potsticker, and my friend went with the classic Chicken Pad Thai. Everything was beautifully presented. And more importantly, tasted delicious.  I had stuffed myself silly with the spinach salad, but could not resist licking my entree plate clean.  My dish automatically comes at a spice level of 1 (on a scale of 5) and I upped to a 3 to give it that perfect kick.   The service was sweet and friendly. Our fruit infused water glasses were never empty.  Thanks Nittaya! I'l be back! Can't wait to come back and try the tapas and wine!!",

So far everything I've ordered is awesome. This is great place to take a date that you really want to impress. I recommend getting a reservation because it's a tiny restaurant.

Still delicious Esaan sausage: little sausages, good flavor but not the best Naked shrimp: shrimp in a Thai sauce, a little too fishy Sweet corn fritters: our least favorite, needed more corn. Mostly ground pork with corn here n there deep fried.  Thai donuts: large order! 5 donuts per order. Still very good but could have used another sweet component.   Service is amazing..

    "text": "We originally booked for 7:30 but got a call that the table won't be ready until 7:45pm. When we got there at 7:42, we were told there will be another 20-25 minute wait. If that was the case, they could have just booked us at 8:15 instead of promising a table at exactly 7:45. The servers obviously didn't want to be there, they looked so miserable that empty plates were not cleared until you point them out to them. The lady who took the credit card payments also had some attitude problem (even if it was her fault), she charged the wrong amount for the credit cards. So we told her why was that the case? Instead of her being apologetic she raised her voice at us and even moving her arms about to make herself heard. I was a little uneasy when that happened since I've never had that kind of experience before especially from an establishment such as this. Overall the food was good, except that the curry was really dry and the sauce was like eating sea water. But other than that dish the catfish came out well. After such a long wait, we would have expected a really good service at least, but nothing, nada! Not even a good explanation. Don't know if I wanna come back and definitely not recommending this to peers. Too bad! It was our first and most probably our last time as well! Don't come here if you have hypertension, you're highly likely gonna get some serious issues! Ha ha!",

I have had Thai in several countries including those down under.  Just had exceptional Thai in San Diego soooooo when I got here I anticipated a good Thai meal & instead I had a meal that beat all the others.  The drunken noodles we're with broccolini & ground chicken (thought it wasn't going to be a good choice). This was cooked to perfection!  The eggplant dish was so good though I'm not a vegetarian I'd come back to just have this.  The red curry chicken was so flavorful & smooth.  While we were stuffed you simply can not leave a message like this without Mango & sticky rice....WOW.  oh I forgot to mention the infused water was refreshing.  Gorgeous atmosphere & I'd absolutely make sure to come back.  Hell I'd drive 6 hrs just to eat here again!",

My favorite meal here starts with the lemongrass coconut soup with shrimp. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth. Then I follow it up with the panang catfish. The baby bok choy are super tender and the sauce on the catfish is terrific. Last time I was there I switched it up and got the salmon with the avocado sauce. Avocado sauce turned me off at first but I tried it anyway. It was spicy and delicious. The only thing that reminded me of avocado was the color of the sauce and a sliced fresh avocado on top. The Thai Michelin star cheff over on the east side is not even close to as good as this restaurant. Well Don Nittaya!",

What really makes this place different is that they serve tapas, which are what the real stars of the menu. You order a bunch of little things and you will still end up full. We got the Volcano shrimp, which come to you on fire, the Spinach salad, which is just tempura fried spinach with a life sauce, the garlic ribs, the Pineapple fried rice, which is served in a scooped out pineapple, the chicken satay, and the curry potato puffs. I also got the Thai iced tea, which I think is one of the best drinks in the world. All in all, the restaurant had a great interior, great food, friendly staff, and I will come again.",

My favorite dish is the avocado curry salmon. I simply can't get enough of this delicious combination.  I also still think it's one of the best Pad Thai in town.       They have a great wine selection.

We were celebrating a birthday and brought some bundtlets to celebrate since most Thai restaurants will serve an array of desserts, but not necessarily cake. This restaurant was no exception. All was well, we even ordered dessert from the menu. Upon receiving our bill, we had been charged a service fee for cutting the cake(which the cakes are small and no one brought anything extra out except for forks). I am completely under the impressions of BYOB, but to not even be told ahead of time or even aware that a fee was to be charged if we were to eat it there. I would have gladly celebrated at home. In addition to all of this I spoke with the manager on duty and he simply apologized and blamed his staff, saying she must not understand protocol she must be still training. She served us completely fine all night with no assistance, knew the menu very well. Unfortunately will not be returning, and would recommend better professionalism as a manager.",

Granted we're there to visit friends and stuff too but like, look guys: come with us to Nittaya's or get wrecked because we're going.   The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a quiet place with low lighting and friendly staff. Basically everything I'm looking for in a restaurant. Loud, bustling, bright places are fine but I have to be in the mood to interact with large groups of people. The only thing worse than people is large groups of them, amirite?  No words I can say will do the food any justice. You just need to try it. Any of it, all of it. Each dish brought to you has a quality that is indicative of the fact that the person who created the dish loves to cook. Their passion for cooking shines through this food in a way that's enjoyable in and of itself. There's a profound joy in taking part in a thing that someone clearly loves, and this is the place to experience that.   I really hope this restaurant is doing and continues to do well.",

My first visit there was a great experience, the food was tasty and cooked to perfection. We did have some miscommunication on the level of spice in my Pad Thai however. They offer a level of heat between 1-5. When I asked my waiter her opinion of the heat, she wasn't of much help and kind of insinuated that they don't make their food too hot. So I ordered a 5 (I like my food hot), but not so much that I can't taste the food! That said, I requested a 5, and told her if I wanted to go hotter, I could always add some in on the side- sort of determine that level on my own.  When she returned with my food, she said, \"I ordered you a 5, but I had them add extra to spice it up\". Hmmm. Well, that extra spice they added made the food intolerable. It was beyond what any restaurant should serve if they want their patrons to actually taste their food. It wasn't enjoyable at all (and I can eat hot chili peppers for breakfast) :)  Overall, the other food we ordered was very tasty. So we returned another night for take out. This time I ordered a level 3 for my Pad Thai. The second time around was not as impressive as the first. The Pad Thai had almost no flavor, spice or otherwise. Even after adding an entire container of chili paste they provided on the side. It was just bleh.   The eggplant dish was absolutely delicious though, totally worth trying!",

The Spinach Salad is amazing and actually the only way spinach should ever be eaten, especially with the \"dressing\" they make that has just the right amount of kick. The only thing I've ever been slightly disappointed in was the Capon, it seemed bland end comparison to everything else which is full of flavor.",

Judging by the other reviews and word of mouth from friends and family, the food is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately after being seated and told by the server that he would be right back, we never encountered  another colleague again.   Maybe it was because we chose to be seated outside but several other guests who were seated outside well after us received their waters and menus immediately whereas we only received the menus from the hostess who sat us. Our server was nowhere to be found and when he eventually came out, he proceeded to provide service to another couple that had just sat down.   It is a shame that we were not able to taste the food, but the lack of attention and bad service quality were too much to bear for us. After 15 minutes of waiting and even as we walked out of the restaurant, not one service person batted an eye.   I am sure this restaurant will continue to be successful but I don't feel inclined to return if this is the type of treatment that even only a small percentage of guests will receive.",

The service is always phenomenal and the vibe is cozy. If you're planning a Friday or Saturday night, call in advance for reservations as it does fill up quickly.

I know this echoes most all of the other reviews on Yelp for Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, but the \"Secret Spinach Salad\" is a must!!!! It is delicious, and now one of my favorite salads! I also will highly recommend the Volcano Shrimp. The spices were fabulous! The Short Rib Curry was a special, not on the regular menu, and very good. Just the right amount of spice to not overwhelm the flavor of the beef. I will definitely be returning to Nittaya's very soon, gotta add this to the regular rotation!",

    "text": "\"To be alive is to totally and openly participate in the simplicity and elegance of here and now.\" - D. Altman  Nittaya is one of the sweetest and nicest owners that you will probably not actually meet. The secret on Nittaya's has been out for a long time...almost as soon as she moved up Lake Mead, transitioning from take-out to one of the nicer Thai restaurants in town. So, unless you knew her from her previous incarnation years ago, or you are a True regular at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, then the amiable chef and owner is probably the only secret left at Nittaya's.  The World Famous Spinach Salad with tempura spinach, lime dressing, and chicken has lived up to its name. I had loved Nittaya's curries before, but this was the dish that brought heightened interest and demonstrated that there was a lot more than traditional curries and noodles  to be had at Nittaya's. It used to be a staple anytime I came and I will still return to it from time-to-time.  These days I am just as likely to branch out and try something new, or return to something that I haven't had in a while. One of my favorites is the Salmon-Avocado Curry--green curry with eggplant, avocado, and zucchini. I don't see myself getting tired of this dish anytime soon.  Nittaya's can hold their own against most of the Thai restaurants in town. Certainly one of the better options, but what separates them is that they are one of three elevated Thai restaurants in town that incorporates great food with a lovely ambiance.",

The service was just as amazing and the food was delicious.  We ordered chicken pot stickers, pork egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps and chicken pad Thai. All of the food came out hot, fresh and delicious. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food they serve and the quality !   We will definitely be returning to Nittaya's in the near future !",

I had the tiger steak as a starter, Namasu(sp), curry & took a container (to go), of Drunken Noodles. I told them I was going back to my hotel to have a second meal & for tomorrow and as I didn't finish anything (completely), asked for the DN & others to be boxed up & taken. Later that evening I opened bag. I guess they assumed I would eat from the container as they had, no napkins, no utensils, just the containers. (Utensils were not in containers). I went down, begged the front desk to open kitchen & eventually got a fork/spoon. The Drunken Noodles had Broccoli & spinach? which were both so bitter I had to push aside. The Drunken Noodles were at best a 6 out of 10. Something tiger steak was very tasty but the Namasu(sp), curry was also not memorable. The three items (with a sprite), was $55.00. Bit pricey for the quality",

All regular Thai places I've been to have regular plates for lunch and dinner $11-16$ How much more food can they give you for a dinner plate? LOL I mean its nice but its not fine  dining, why would regular HALF pad Thai noodles during lunch be $12... Never has happened to me. As far as the food I ordered, it was whatever a normal pad thai meal, nothing that blew me out of the water..  I asked for level 4 spicy out of 5, NO spice what so ever. Man idk if the dinner would even be worth it here. Would not order lunch again, ill just order from another thai place that has regular dishes at $12 all day then this place. $12 for half of pad Thai and ONE dumpling is NOT a special to me. That's just regular lmfao  Food was tasty good had flavor but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  I would NOT spend money on dinner here.",

The food that I had was quite delicious (lettuce wraps, pineapple fried rice, chicken skewers, garlic edamame) so that's why they earned 3 stars.  The deduction, however, comes from the HUGE communication problem with the chefs when it comes to making changes due to food allergies. Lost in translation, maybe?   Listen carefully, if you can not eat shellfish, dairy, gluten, etc. you may want to pass on dining here. Two of the friends I came with have severe (life threatening) food allergies and have never felt so frustrated, annoyed and disappointed while dining out before. It was made crystal clear about the allergies and yet two dishes were still served to them with the allergic ingredients in them. The server seemed to think it was funny, but we didn't find the humor in it. Then our food was cleared away before we were even finished eating it. To make matters worse, when I mentioned it to him, he just laughed it off again. Sadly, nothing was ever compensated from our bill, and two of the girls ordered pizza when they got home. Dinner fail.",

I just wanted to go somewhere that served Coconut Soup for my sore throat and some place very quiet because I also had a headache. I wasn't feeling too great as you can tell. When we stepped in it looked very cozy with the brown, gold and brick walls. The tables were draped in white it was very calming.   I started off with the Coconut Soup it came in soup dish. The dish was a little shallow meaning that there was only one serving. I'm used to places like Thai Barbecue that serves it in a big silver server which comes with more than enough to take home. I was sick so I was hoping for more. I know that this is a Thai tapas place but my soup wasn't on the tapas menu so I thought it would be bigger. The soup still had a nice taste and the chicken pieces were not too big which was perfect. The only thing is I wish the soup was served hotter.   My husband had the Citrus Steak Salad which had cucumbers, tomato, red onion and spicy lime dressing . That was really good and the meat was nice and tender.   I tried the Grilled Mango Shrimp that was served with a Spicy Mango Sauce. I was afraid the dish might be too salty because of the bacon wrapped shrimp but it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet. It reminded me of the shrimp I used to order at Tom Ham's Light House in San Diego years ago! It was delicious!   We also ordered some fried rice. It was good but I don't recommend taking it home because it doesn't taste good the next day . The rice is too mushy that it just doesn't keep well.   My husband and I shared the Thai buttermilk donuts with Coconut Rum Caramel sauce . It was a sweet ending to a great meal.",

My boyfriend and I got the fried rice which was absolutely wonderful, very tasty and not greasy! and also the shrimp curry and their awesome pad thai......They served water infused with fruit which was uhm uhm uhm...This is like a gourmet thai restaurant so don't expect big portions. I looove this place!",

    "text": "Horrible horrible horrible horrible service. I like to think that I'm pretty patient and understanding but even this tested my patience. We came in with high hopes driving all the way from south Las Vegas to eat here. When we entered we waited about three minutes then we were seated. This is where everything starts... We waited 5 - 7 minutes for the server or anyone and nothing then a group of 3 came after us and immediately got water. We still hadn't received water or even eye contact at this point. About 13  minutes later I had to flag down the Asian busser to take our order he said he would bring the waitress again we waited and nobody came out. When the waitress went to fill the group next to us water she finally noticed we were staring at her and she came to fill our water. I had to ask her if she would take our order. So finally after all that we ordered crispy pork, crispy spinach salad, and avocado curry.. The group who came after us and ordered after us got their food. Finally when our food came it was delicious and we ate everything. But we had to flag the waitress down for EVERYTHING! Water, sauces, extra rice. Like wtf? Not even once did they come up to us and check us and make sure we were okay. We basically had to beg them to help us. Then later I asked for the check because once again nobody came to check up after they took all our plates away. I asked a white waitress for the check, then a group was next to us and water was spilt all over my purse and the group who was reviving the water. I mean that's okay but I had to clean up the water after he spilt it. Yeah.. Not cool. After another fifteen minutes of waiting for our check we had to ask another person to get it. Then we had to wait another 15 min to get our check and finish everything. I was so done by then. You guys were lucky we left I tip I felt like walking out and not paying because this was the worst service I have ever received in my life. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Food is not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "Worst customer service experience ever!! My sister and i went to have lunch here, everything was good, server was good. But one of the lunch specials tasted off, the chicken tasted almost not fully cooked. We told the server, and he acted weird about it. We didn't have time to wait for anything else, and had a two year old.  And not to mention, he offered us to have dessert like in replacement for the meal. During us explaining to him our issue... He was never sympathetic or tried to say sorry about what had happen.. I'm sorry but if chicken doesn't have a right texture I won't eat it nor will I give it to my 2 year old son. So I sent it back.. Never was asked to remake it... Nothing was said ... Just if we wanted anything else or the dessert.. I get the bill & I'm still being charged for the whole meal... So I walk in there to ask why I'm still being charged for something I didn't touch and he tells me that \"there is no return policy\" \"it was still made\" \"the chef tasted it and said its fine\" so I walk out feeling very frustrated.... & my sister goes in from the patio to talk to a manager.. She was so rude!!! She said she would not take it off the bill what so ever and that the chef tasted it and it's fine... & if we want they can box it up for us ! WHAT? After your chef tasted our food and I just told you the chicken wasn't right! We will never come back ever again! I had this dish before here and I know this one wasn't right. And the server should think about how he handles his customer problems and maybe find a different job because now it's hurting him. So here's your warning... If it doesn't come out right, they simply don't care....",

    "text": "What can I say, I really like this place.  It's not traditional Thai, but what do you expect with Thai tapas.  Everything I had was really, really good and inventive.    My husband and I were starving so we started off with three \"tapas\" - the shrimp patties, stuffed angel wings, and spinach salad.  I love the spinach salad!  It's tempura spinach leaves served in a big cone (like French fries) with a yummy dressing on the side.  The shrimp patties and stuffed angel wings were also very good, but the spinach salad stole the show.  The shrimp patties were pretty much what you would expect.  The menu says \"Thai spices\" but the patties aren't spicy at all.  Decent size and the plum sauce drizzled on top tasted great. The stuffed angel wings are a little different than what I'm used to, but still yummy.  A lot more chicken than \"stuffing\" and with cilantro.    For entrees, we had the spicy green bean pork and the basil beef.  Their spice rating system is from 1 to 5.  The spicy green bean pork can only be made a \"2\" or higher.  Hence the word \"spicy\" in the name.  We got the pork as a \"2\" and the beef as a \"4.\"  The \"2\" was just perfect for me and the pork with green beans was delicious.  The beef was also good but I could tell it had more oil on it and I would probably break into a sweat if ate too much.  The entrees come with white rice, which was cooked properly.  All the plates come with little orchids on them and are served family style.  I liked the presentation of all the dishes, especially the spinach salad.  For beer, they have Peroni, Blue Moon, and Coors Light on tap. We ended up having two Blue Moons, which went really well with the food. They do have some more interesting beers by the bottle, such as a Joseph James stout.  They have a very nice selection of wines but all the red wine is stored on shelves, so it might be too warm.  But they did have a sign outside offering 50% of wine by the bottle on Thursdays so I may have to check that out.  They also carry some sake.    Most of the desserts have coconut.  It's a Thai restaurant so I expect that.  We ended up having the Thai donuts, which were really tasty.  The caramel sauce is supposed to have coconut in it, but I didn't taste it.  They took my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, no problem.  Service was great - very attentive and helpful.    Small, cute place.  A little dark, especially in the bathroom, but the decor is nice.  Looking at the reviews, I think this restaurant has been paying attention and making adjustments because I didn't have close to the same experience other reviewers had. This restaurant is definitely going on my regular rotation.",

    "text": "This place is so flipping awesome. In December, Ruben and I took our friends visiting from England based on a recommendation. I called for a table and all they had were four seats at the bar, which was more comfortable than we expected. It was a rounded corner, so it still allowed us to be facing each other and it was still intimate. We enjoyed everything we tried and the service was wonderful. Great atmosphere!  We tried the Lettuce Wraps, Fried Avocado, Curry Puffs, Esaan Sausage, World Famous Spinach Salad, Five Spice BBQ Ribs with Citrus-Ginger Glaze, Emerald Fried Rice, Calamari, Housemade Coconut Ice Cream, and Thai Donuts. My favorites were the EMERALD FRIED RICE (I mean, phenomenal), SPINACH SALAD (they'll warn you that it's not really a salad, but it really doesn't matter because the flavor of the lime dressing and the tempura spinach is amazing), ESAAN SAUSAGE (the flavors that they manage to pack in here is so great, you'll be wanting more than the three served), and CALAMARI (wonderful batter and delicious dipping sauce).  All of us truly enjoyed our meal and had so much fun with all the dishes. Because it's such a small space, definitely plan ahead and come with a large group to take advantage of trying a little of everything! They're very accommodating and I'm so happy we were able to dine with them. I can't wait to go back!  Edit (03/01/13): Ruben and I went back for a date night and made a reservation earlier in the day. We had a rocky start; they were really busy and since we were in the back, we felt ignored. No one even acknowledged us when we walked in the door, actually. It took a while and when I said we had a reservation, they just pointed to the table in the back. Once our order was taken, it was smooth sailing (well, it also started to die down from when we first arrived) and everyone was attentive throughout our meal. It's a hard restaurant to be in if you're claustrophobic because you're in extremely close quarters to EVERYONE seated around you. I didn't enjoy being sandwiched between two other parties and unfortunately, hearing their entire conversation. So although it's an intimate space, it's definitely not for an intimate evening. I will probably request the corner bar seating next time since we had a much nicer experience there.  The food was phenomenal again and that definitely solidified my love of Nittaya's. We ordered the same four dishes that stood out last time and it was just as good as I remember. We also ordered the Coconut Soup and Spicy Basil Eggplant as well. Both were delicious, but neither favorites of mine. Since they were out of their bread pudding (I really want to try this!), we opted for the Creme Brulee trio of Green Tea, Coconut, and Ginger Lemongrass. YUM! We're not big fans of creme brulee, but these weren't overly sweet and the unique flavors were fun. Oh, and their Sangria is great! I'll need to go back to redeem my free glass!",

    "text": "Transported upon entry, this cozy dining room with a wine bar suggests a more European feel than a Thai restaurant.  Two menus are presented - one a conventional Thai listing with adapted names for American tastes, like \"Pad Z-U\".  The other is a tapas menu with an Asian bend.  The papaya salad with prawns tasted authentic but a touch spicy for my dining partner.  We were not offered the '1 to 5' spicy range, but notice the reviews include such a choice.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the salad 'kick' without complaint.  The catfish was presented with a tasty curry-like sauce that worked very well.  We considered tapas, but our two dishes satisfied.  The wine list demonstrates a competent selection with an adequate variety by the glass.  However, our Pinot Noir must have sat in the bottle at least overnight and lacked character.  It's truly awkward to send back glasses of wine during a first visit as these glasses were \"borderline\" in my opinion, so we shifted gears for 2nd glasses and commented politely to the waiter about the 1st.  I suggest tasting before committing until they cycle their by-the-glass bottles properly.  Service was capable and polite.  Reservations are recommended as the size of the dining room is limited for your pleasure and comfort.  I'll be back.",

I definitely recommend the sangria.  I ordered the basil chicken and the muay thai fried rice. I liked that the basil chicken wasn't over sauced and had a bit of a kick to it for me. I can't handle too much spice, so this was just enough. But you can step it up asking for a spiciness from 1 - 5.  I liked that the fried rice had a bit more to it, with peppers and basil.  Overall, this is a good place for lunch or dinner, or just a glass of wine.  ProTip: on the weekends, be sure to make a reservation for dinner.",

I had read an article about Nittaya's Secret Kitchen in a local magazine and decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious!  As an appetizer, we ordered the \"spinach salad\" and the potato pouches in curry sauce.  Both were amazing.  I had never had tempura spinach before and I quite enjoyed it, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce.  I think the measure of any Thai restaurant can be found in what their curry tastes like, and this one did not disappoint.  I look forward to coming back and ordering a curry entree next time.  The third dish we ordered was the drunken noodles.  It was a little on the sweet side, but still very tasty.  The reason why I knocked off a star, despite the phenomenal food, had to do with the snooty attitude of the hostess/waitress as we walked in.  My boyfriend and I decided to bike to the restaurant (so we were both in casual/sporty clothes) and the hostess/waitress seemed surprised when we said we wanted a table to eat there.  Nittaya's has a nice, intimate vibe, but I don't think we were so out of place as to deserve that reaction.  Especially since two women in yoga clothes walked in ten minutes later.  Despite that setback, I would definitely return to enjoy more delicious Thai cuisine!",

I found Nattaya's green curry chicken to be delicious, with a hint of spiciness, though not at all overwhelming. And here's the kicker...like many Thai restaurants, Nattaya uses ample bamboo shoots in their version, but like very few, they cook it in a way so as not to distract from the rest of the dish. Delicious!  All in all, I enjoyed my lunch, which also included a refreshing house salad and potsticker as part of the special. Their wait staff was very attentive and friendly, and this surely enhanced my dining experience. Will I be back - absolutely. Now that Nattaya has made me a believer with their Green Curry, I'm ready to explore the rest of the seemingly delectable menu, which includes ample \"small plates\" by the way.",

First off, seems if you order off the lunch menu, they assume you are in a hurry and rush to place the order and bring out the food.  The problem is that the food arrives before the salad and potsticker that is included in the lunch option. The food was not very hot either.  Asked the wait staff about the salad and potsticker and they just gave a rather blank, \"huh?\" kinda look.  Five minutes later, the salads came out and were strangely bland with a lot of vinegar on the lettuce.    Another issue is that you are given two forks and a napkin, no knife.  So because we ordered noodle dishes, we asked for knives, again, blank look from the wait staff.    We were not in a hurry, we do not work, bad assumption on the part of the staff, however, no excuse for the lack of manners and bad service for the second time.  We will not be back, ever!",

We went in their for lunch and everyone loved every dish except the Tofu dish which they asked to be on a heat level of a 4 and it was not very hot.  I did not try that dish because it was not what I normally eat but there was 10 of us and I tried 8 of the dishes and they were amazing.  The spinach appetizer was fabulous.  It was like the best French fry you could imagine with a secret sauce that was out of this world.  When back in Vegas I would love to go back to this restaurant and try more dishes out.  You will not be disappointed.",

Bar tender was not friendly and seemed overwhelmed. The rest of the staff has nice and hospitable and apologetic. The spinach salad was amazing and the eggplant Panang was excellent.  Pad Z U was above average. I'd go back but make sure they repeat back to you your reservation so you don't have any problem.",

They recently remodeled to be larger, which was a must because they used to get really cramped. It's still tight but the decor is adorable and cozy.  Menu faves: beef jerky and crab rangoons (both from the tapas), and Massaman curry.",

My fiance tried to return them at first because she saw chicken HAIR. They claimed it was lemongrass - really?! So we each had one wing and then the feather. We promptly returned them and were able to get a refund.  The main dishes weren't so bad - Shrimp Pad Thai and Seafood Madness. But the price - $19 each?! There's better Pad Thai for half that price at a dozen other places around town.  Surprisingly this place was near-packed, though it's also quite tiny. I can mainly attribute the crowd to the fact that there are few other quality restaurants in the area.  Which brings me to my conclusion. We have basically a South Summerlin and a North Summerlin. Both have wonderful homes in beautiful neighborhoods. But a big difference - FOOD. We live in the South and are truly blessed to have a ridiculous amount of tasty restaurants in our area. Down the road from us (near Ft Apache) there are THREE Thai restaurants that are all a better value than Nittaya's.  To you North Summerlin folks - I feel sorry for your limited food options - please feel free to drive out to the South side for some REAL food!",

    "text": "I didn't think I'd find a massaman curry better than the one at Chada Thai. But, I did at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Located in a small strip mall on Rampart, this is definitely no secret. If you come on the weekend be prepared for a long wait. The interior is tiny with tables too close together and a bar area that has almost no separation from the dining room. The massaman curry ($16) is excellent, as is their \"World famous\" spinach salad ($11). Crispy, light tempura batter covers a heaping mound of spinach. Add the chicken  and lime dressing to it and it's unforgettable. For more subtle flavors, the coconut soup ($9) is the way to go with a thin, smooth broth bathing chunks of chicken, tomatoes and mushrooms.  If you can get a table, dining at this modern Thai place is worth the trip to the westside suburbs. It may not get the press that other popular Thai places get, but they are more than capable of challenging the heavy hitters in town for the title of best Thai restaurant.",

It wasn't great, like some of the Thai places in Chinatown or Lotus, but it was definitely good. Nothing we had tasted bad.  We had the Thai beef jerky, the spinach salad (this, alone, would be 5 stars), crab fried rice, drunken noodles, and the Cornish hen.

The food is outstanding in flavor with just the right seasoning, not too spicy or pungent. Good portions and selection with a twist on traditional Thai flavors. The service on the day we went was terribly slow and the waitstaff did not pay attention to customers, reacted slowly to requests and seemed to lack a sense of urgency. It's the only reason the review earns 3 stars. Otherwise it would have been a 5 but 2 hours for lunch is excessive.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to try this place out tonight. I thought it must be bigger at first when we arrived, because the parking lot was 2/3rds full. So while we're waiting for our 3rd, we step inside and see a podium that isn't being manned. The place looked cramped, and they had a table everywhere trying to maximize the space. So I looked around real quick, there's no one ready to step up to the podium. Someone is performing bus boy duties 3 feet away from us at a table, but he can't even look up to us. So, turning around to see the bar tender, she makes eye contact and then wanders down to the farthest point of the bar, away from the door. The two of us stood there for close to 5 minutes, and actually turned around to leave when we were boxed in by 2 more customers coming in the door. Now the podium is right in front of the door, and there's a table in-between the bar and the wall, so there is no where to go. 4 people at the front, and the area is so small, we can't even shut the door.  Finally, the bus boy walks into the back, and our waitress/hostess finally comes up and asks who was first. My friend and I took her attention and asked to sit outside while we wait for our 3rd to show. A table we wanted outside was unmanned when we arrived, but had yet to be cleared off. She said it'd be 3 or 4 minutes for them to clear, and so offered to step out to wait. After those 4 minutes, she brought us a menu to look at, but the table still wasn't cleared. (I really hope they had half the crew call in or something, because she was all over the place.) After dropping off the menu, the waitress/host steps back inside; finally coming out a few minutes later to clear the table herself as the guy who was performing bus boy duties before is now nowhere to be seen. So she tells us the table is ready, and we take a seat.  Our 3rd person shows up right after the waitress brings us water, and then we waited. And waited. About 15 minutes have gone by, we've all looked at the menu 3 times, and she finally comes back and asks if we wanted drinks. So, not to miss out again, we place our drink and meal orders all at once. And then it seemed like ground hog's day, because we waited some more. And more. Almost 10 minutes later, the other 2 with me get their meals, which was surprisingly quick for meal prep considering how slow everything else had been. About a minute after that, the bus boy finally makes another appearance by trying to give our 3 beverages to the couple sitting next to us (who are almost done already, mind you). And then we waited some more. I still haven't gotten my food. My friends and I have been talking for about 5 minutes now, and I still don't have my food. I finally tell them to start without me, and then after nearly another 5 minutes, my meal finally arrived.  Now, I have to say, the meal was awesome. The dish presentation was on point, and the food tasted better than it looked. But for the 3 of us there that night, only one of us got rice with our meals, even though the menu showed all of them coming with it. And once you start eating hot, you burn through your drinks, so they couldn't get refilled fast enough. Our latecomer to dinner mentioned her curry was much hotter than the menu suggested, and mine was as well (luckily, I prefer hotter.) We ended up being there for over an hour and a half, and once we finally got our rice, we had to get up from the table to ask for drink refills after about half an hour had passed without an employee in sight.  We finally got to see our waitress come by again at closing, and she asked if we wanted any deserts. We declined and just asked for our check, and then we saw her right back. Not surprisingly, they're making a mad dash now to close the place down. We had our bills inside of two minutes, and before she can turn around, we put our cards in and handed them right back. The bus boy decided it was time to make another appearance, and he starts clearing off the cushions from all the outside furniture while we're waiting for the cards to be processed. We chatted for another minute or two after signing our receipts, and you can see he's getting impatient for us to go so they can clear the table and snatch off the tablecloth. I quietly suggested to our friends we should go, and before we can step off the sidewalk to the parking lot, the table is cleared of all remnants and he's back inside the door.  All in all, the food was amazing. But as I hopped back into my jeep for the short drive home, I was relieved I came here with friends inside of bringing a date. I can't say it's a place I'll ever go back to unless they decided to move to a bigger location and hire some more staff to help.",

One of my girlfriends recently told me about this place, so we had a girlfriends outing there. All I can say is that it is definitely one of my favorite Thai spots now. It's a bit small, but it makes it cozy and makes you want it all the more because you have to make a reservation to get in. The fried spinach or kale appetizer (can't remember) is delicious, the veggie egg rolls, and Pad-Thai are amazing dishes to try. Since the food was so good and the place was such a jewel to find I have since taken my family there to eat and a date on a separate occasion. They all loved it, and loved the quaint atmosphere.",

When i first walked in, my initial thought was... \"ah man... just another mediocre americanized/fusion thai place\" but boy was I wrong.   The pad thai here was great. It had lots of flavor and had good sizable portions. The green curry was a bit more on the bland side but the chicken in the curry was juicy and tender. I would skip the curry next time and stick with the pad thai.   The service was great and there was at least 2 or 3 waitresses making sure we were good at all times. Most of the people here were a part of the older crowd with a few young people sprinkled in.   All in all, a nice little restaurant to stop by for a date or if you are showing people around. I happened to be lucky and was able to snag a table before the dinner rush, but I would suggest making reservations beforehand.",

It thai spot that definitely would make the drive again and check out more of the menu items.   I meet the girls for lunch. We got there soon as they opened at 11am. It kind of good idea if going for lunch because the place only got more more packed. Just like past reviews the place is pretty small even with the extra dining area (guess it was recently or not all new for first timer). We got couple appetizers to share the famous spinach salad and golden pouches. My friends mention the spinach salad MUST every visit! I can honestly tell you more times then not hype never lives up to reality. BUT......in this case the spinach salad was spot on amazing!! It dish never seen at other Thai spots around town. The concept may soon simple tempura batter style fresh spinach leaves. Everything about it is divine intervention. The spinach perfect balance cause nice light, refreshing, and then at crispy batter golden brown on the outside. It reminds me of good vegetable tempura. The kicker in this case is the vinaigrette or sauce come with kicks it up notch to divine. Addicting. Like you pop one in your mouth and can keep going and going and going. I could seriously order two of them be happy! The pouches just never worked for me. I love the presentation. ALL the food at Nittaya has beautiful presentation definitely more upscale feel like past reviews and the flower is nice touch. The curry sauce that had no problem with really good tasted it by itself. The combination of potato bland the outside pouch. I would recommend getting that same curry sauce in entree dish.   I had the drunken noodle lunch special. It was awesome. The portion size for lunch special was nice!  I figured more on upscale might be opposite.   I am sure the rest of the menu is just as solid all around. Nittaya Secret Kitchen is not much secret anymore. It in the top five lot of sites for Thai food in Vegas. Well deserved. Definitely looking for Thai place off the strip, amazing food, and cool little spot. Nittaya winnah!! Make sure you get that spinach salad!!!",

    "text": "This place really isn't  a secret anymore but back in the day it was little known. It's so busy some evenings that they expanded to now include two dining rooms. Neither one is that large so it's got a great little atmosphere going on. Nittaya's is undeniably the best Thai tapas and restaurant in town! This little gem in tucked in the corner of a small plaza just off the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead, behind the B of A.  The key to its success, you can most likely find Nittaya cooking in the kitchen herself on any given evening. That, and the expansive selection of tapas along with the right combination of spices on just about everything. Fabulous selection of curry dishes, pad thai options and unique entrees. May I suggest you try the lamb chops if you're not vegan. I personally think they are the best item on the entire menu! This is always a glutinous affair for us but we kept our will power in check this visit. Had an order of the five spiced ribs, crab rangoons and some pot stickers for appetizers followed by those amazing chops I suggested accompanied by a bowl of white rice.  If you don't live in the area it really is more than worth the drive! Happy hour starts at 3 Monday -Thursday for those who like to sit at the bar top.",

    "text": "Was so excited for this place after reading so many amazing reviews!m- but it was pretty thoroughly disappointing. Better called the House or Deep Fried Foods We Call Thai. And we tried a LOT of things.   The World Famous Spinach Salad was the only notably good thing. But $13!? For a few handfuls of breaded fried spinach? No.   The decor is romantic and lovely.   everything was overpriced and mediocre.   Chicken larb- did not taste like larb. Just ground up chicken on lettuce leaves. No noticeable flavor occurring. C  Crab Rangoon- was good and fresh, an A, but the price makes it a B.   Curry puffs- average. Tiny portion for the price.   Fried avocado- are the theme here? These people are making $ hand over foot for basically selling burger joint fried food In a fancy environment.   Phuket poppers- jalapeno cream cheese and shrimps deep fried. C-  boring and all fried and good luck finding the smidgens of shrimp in there.   Chicken veggie fried rice w an egg- fine. B. Nearly $20/plate makes it a C  Basil tofu- this plate was a huge pile of tofu w some onions and a few pepper slices and a nondescript sweet sauce. C+,  but price tag makes it a C-    Drunken noodles w tofu- we got these bc pad Thai is so variable but drunken noodles are always good. $18 worth of oh it is actually possible to make drunken noodles boring. C+. Price point and the fact that this dish is so hard to make bad makes it a D+  Pad Thai w shrimp and pad Thai w tofu- big portions, but again, not big or flavorful enough to warrant the price tag  Thai donuts- yes we decided to order more fried food.  There was a birthday happening and the person likes donuts. Overly sweet. Overpriced.   Mango Thai sticky rice- was delicious.   We had a birthday and an anniversary in our party of 8. They added candles but didn't comp anything.   And the service was weird- 1/2 the table got all courses of their food before the others got anything. They clearly forgot one person's order, meaning she got nothing at all to eat until most others had finished apps and entrees, but they didn't apologize or give any sort of discount.   Disappointing. Even more so when we were paying the huge bill. Bummer.",

It truly lives up to its name as a secret but I fear the secret is getting out.  I went with a friend on the recommendation of a colleague. Our server was Devon and she knows the menu cold. She guided us through the northern thai section  all we had to do was listen to her descriptions and we knew what we wanted.  We started with the ESaan Sausage. The flavor and fragrance of this lemongrass pork sausage was amazing. We moved to the fired crispy garlic ribs. The coconut soup with chicken was delicious. Flavor on top of flavor. The sweet eggplant over rice was accentuated by a wonderful sweet plum wine. The grilled octopus salad and fried crab salad were leading to the best entree ever. The Kao- Soi. Slow cooked pork shoulder with egg noddles and curry broth. Devon carefully mixed in the dry noodles to the soup and it was all we could do to not fight over the broth that was left over. If you get the opportunity you must try this restaurant. I know it will not be a secret for long but it's one of my favorites.",

    "text": "When entering Nittaya's, it really feels like you've stepped into a \"secret\" establishment. With the dim lighting and wine laced walls, it has quite the romantic feel. It does not look like your average Thai restaurant in Vegas that's for sure. And to be completely honest, there's nothing average about it, from small plates to wine it impresses me on every angle.  My go to plates are usually the volcano shrimp, the flavored edamame, the tiger steak, and even though this is a small item to brag about, the cream cheese crab ragoons are literally the best I've ever had. Don't skip on things like the garlic rice or drunken noodles though, they're just as fire as the rest.  I've learned to make reservations. I've been turned away once from them being booked, and once told I had one hour to eat. It's a very small place so I didn't mind the honesty. A few times they fit me in at the bar, which was just as nice as any table.  There's infused flavored water daily, and half price bottles of wine I believe on Thursday's.  I'm hesitant to write the review because I don't want to give away the secret!",

While the entrees are more expensive than your typical Thai place, the serving sizes are huge and more than enough to share between a group.   Start off the meal with their famous spinach salad. As the parentheses on their menu implies, this is not really a salad, but delicious nonetheless. Spinach leaves are individually coated and battered in tempura and deep fried. It has a great spicy lime dressing dipping sauce that accompanies it. This dish is surprisingly large and filling, and probably should not be shared between only two people.   For main courses, we shared the popular basil chicken, crabmeat fried rice, and drunken noodles. Of the three, I loved the crabmeat fried rice as it had a generous helping of real crabmeat. The drunken noodles also had ground chicken and basil, which made the order of basil chicken somewhat redundant.   No meal is complete without a happy ending and the family style coconut ice cream is perfect to share. I love the house-made coconut ice cream, but the coconut sticky rice at the bottom became quite hard from the cold ice cream and I wasn't sure if that was the best use of sticky rice. But for coconut fans, you can't do better than coconut, on top of coconut, inside a coconut.",

I haven't had Thai food in a long time, and it turns out Nittaya's is less than 2 minutes from my house. So I drove there to get my grub on, only to find that Nittaya's is packed to the gills.  Fortunately, there was a spot at the bar that I was able to squeeze into, and had a good conversation with a Vietnam veteran that I had a lot in common with. Having been to Thailand, my favorite dish is a chicken massaman curry, so that is what I ordered. Plus, I got some chicken pot stickers to whet my appetite. I will say that the menu is quite large, and there is a whole lot to choose from.  The pot stickers were excellent. Slight crisp, juicy inside, and the soy dipping sauce made for a perfect bite.  Then came my curry. The portions were very generous, and included a big bowl of white rice. Everything tasted exactly as it should, and the curry was the right consistency and flavor. The only thing I could gripe about was that it was not spicy at all, and could have used some heat. Next time I was ask them to bring it. :)  Besides that, it's a bit on the pricey side for Thai food, but I enjoyed it and will come back for more.",

This place is phenomenal and during every bite I knew I had to leave nothing but outstanding remarks.   It's in a little corner barely visible from the street but when you walk through it's False door you enter a space that captures an atmosphere all it's own.   For starters, I recommend the Lemongrass with shrimp soup. It it to die for. If this is the only thing they did well, I would keep coming back for it. However, that's far from the truth. Everything we had was fantastic. Truly a restaurant I hope to see expand.   Kylie ordered the citrus steak salad. She wasn't in a spicy mood but thankfully, there are plenty of options for those who either lack the pallet or the tolerance for spicy foods. The steak came out perfectly cooked to medium rare next to this beautiful bed of salad with a citrus sauce along the bottom. Never too overpowering.  I've been in a seafood kick as of late. The polite staff recommended the seafood madness mix 3. Although, a huge fan of spicy food, I decided to not over do it the first time to keep the balance of the dish. A simple 3 on their 1-5 scale of spicy is sufficient to keep most happy. Out came a wonderful presentation of mussels, shrimp, and fish next to a flower and a plate of steamed white rice. Dig in because you won't want to share.   On the drink side, they offer wine by the glass or the bottle.   I highly recommend this place.",

My first few visits were exclusively for dinner and they serve great options, but recently I've tried their lunch menu and they offer some exceptional meals at a good value. My favorites are the drunken noodles and any of their curries but I haven't had one thing at Nittaya's. The fried spinach salad is always a favorite and despite not usually liking deep fried food, this dish is always a treat.  The restaurant is small so reservations are always suggested.",

Second she didn't give me my total, she just said our order should be ready in 15 minutes. When my mother and I arrived for our order. No one greeted us as we entered. I said I was there for a pick up the lady behind the bar went to get our take out. She came with a receipt and with her had out expecting the payment without even telling us our total until we asked. My mother handed her debt card. She returned with the receipt and didn't even say thank you for coming and just handed it like \"sign and go about your day\" with no words!   The food was decent for Thai food. It is very overpriced for the amount of food.   The service I expected for a place with such great reviews what totally unacceptable!",

They were able to accommodate our party, even though I made a last minute reservation on Christmas Eve. Sadly, I did not get one of the white cushy chairs; they brought in an outdoor table and chairs, in order to squeeze us in--literally. By the way, the restaurant was super busy that night, and I was just thrilled to be back.  Our server was sweet and very witty. She made the best recommendations, and made us feel well taken care of.  We ordered Pad Thai, Pad Si Ew, fried tofu, green curry chicken and their signature spinach salad. The salad was the perfect appetizer for our party of four. We enjoyed it so much that I ordered it for dessert (for the entire table of course). Be advised, this is a savory, deep fried salad, with a sweet sauce on the side.   Normally, we order several desserts and tea, but we were stuffed. Their pastry chef does a fine job, so please don't skip dessert.",

I would order it again for sure!! And my husband ordered the drunken noodles, which I tried it and I would sooo recommend that too. It was really cute inside. I had such a good time. You are sitting pretty close to other people in there. I could see that not being people's jam, but I definitely didn't mind. Oh, how could I forget, so I started doing this to my water because it tastes AMAZING, they infuse apples and cucumbers in their water. I've never heard of that combo. I'm familiar with cucumber and lemon infused water, but apple and cucumber water?! Sooo bomb!!",

We tried everything that was recommended to us for our first time and we were not disappointed. We did the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce, salmon avocado curry (which I wasn't too keen on from the description, but once I actually tried it I was so thankful I listened), we did the world famous spinach salad.... Not a salad at all, but the sauce was to die for. I checked in on Yelp to receive a free sangria... DELICIOUS and beautiful presentation! This place is a MUST GO TO! Recommending you make a reservation because we showed up at 5:30 and we were the only ones in the dining room - but 30 minutes to an hour later there wasn't a table available!! LOVE this place.",

    "text": "I kind of wish there was a half-star rating, since Nittaya's falls between 3 and 4 stars for me. I rounded up based on the expectation that my next experience will be even better.  We went to Nittaya's for dinner last night and it was quite busy. We hadn't thought to make a reservation (our fault) but there wasn't a long wait, which was nice. The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable. You get quite friendly with your neighbors, which is good if you are social, or if you just want to look at their food. They do have some outdoor seating, which looked pleasant, and we'll definitely try next time.  On being sat, we were offered a fruit infused water. I thought it was very nice, subtle, and something a little different.  Before I go any further, I have to admit that I am NOT a Thai food expert. I have actually actively avoided Thai food for years because I couldn't handle spice. I only recently began developing any spice tolerance and  I was hoping a \"fusion\" place like Nittaya's would help ease me into a heretofore unexplored cuisine. I was definitely not disappointed on that count. My husband ordered the fried avocado as an appetizer. Unfortunately, it took a REALLY long time to come out of the kitchen. We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it. Finally however, it did come out and oh, it was worth the wait! The avocado was a brilliant green, with just enough coating to give it a delicious crunch without being oily. The sauce that came with it was bright and flavorful and just a little spicy, perfectly cutting through the creaminess of the avocado. For entrees my husband ordered the duck curry and I ordered the tofu curry, and here is where we came to another service problem. My curry came to the table roughly ten minutes before my husband's ever made it out of the kitchen. The waitress was extremely apologetic and offered us comped desserts to make up for it. Again, the food was totally worth the wait. The tofu was nicely seared (which many places don't bother to do) and the sauce, although a bit on the sweet side, was very delicious. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his duck curry, saying the duck was very moist, tender, and perfectly cooked. I tried one of the cherry tomatoes from his dish and though it was a little spicier than mine it wasn't overwhelming. Then it was dessert. I chose the Thai Donuts, while my husband got the fried banana rolls. Both came out piping hot and absolutely delicious. The only complaint I would make about the donuts is that I would have liked a ramekin of some kind of sauce to dip them into.  The waitress apologized again, and assured us that the kitchen normally runs much smoother. We told her we appreciated her candor, and that we would definitely be back. And we will!",

After many people telling me I have to give it a second chance, I did. Worse than the first. Yes the spinach salad was good, but you can fry a sock and it would be tasty. Got the seafood madness and that is exactly what it was. The frozen shrimp tasted like mussel and the mussel tastes like shit! The restaurant should spend less money on flower garnish and more on fresh ingredients. And that was only my meal my husbands was pretty bad too.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to have dinner at Nittaya's  as we wanted to try a restaurant we had never been to before and Nittaya's menu of Thai inspired tapas was intriguing.  Nittaya's is a small, nicely appointed restaurant on the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead.  The restaurant has a long bar with comfortable looking leather stools and just eleven tables set with little oil burning candles, white table clothes and fresh flowers. When we arrived on a Monday night, at 5:00 pm, we were the  first guests to be seated, but by the time we left two hours later, the place was nearly full.  Service was wonderful.  Our severs were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu items, prompt, and unobtrusive.  Our server even asked if we'd like to sample the wine we decided on before we committed to order it.  Nittaya's has two menus, one for traditional choices of appetizers, salads and entrees, and a tapas menu featuring a vast selection of Thai inspired little dishes. The restaurant also serves a decent selection of wine and beer. My friends and I decided to order several dishes from the Tapas menu and share them.    We ordered the \"World Famous Spinach  Salad\", bbq ribs with five spice, curry potato puffs,  mango shrimp, beef jerky, pork egg rolls, and crab wontons.  The True winner in all of those selections was the spinach salad which wasn't really a salad.  It was tempura fried spinach leaves served with a tangy sauce that contained cashews and chicken.  It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend anyone who dines at Nittaya's to try it.  The beef jerky was also good and not like traditional tough dry slices of beef.  The jerky was tender, tangy marinated pieces of  beef with a good amount of heat.  I enjoyed this dish very much, but one of my dining companions thought it had a little too much heat.  The mango shrimp were ok.  They were small size, shelled shrimp wrapped in bacon and served with a creamy mango sauce.  They were good, but would have been better if the shrimp were bigger and the bacon a little less overpowering.  The crab wontons and egg rolls were good but did not stand apart from those sold at chain take-out restaurants.  Two of the dishes we had were disappointing, with the ribs having a nice flavor, but being so tough they required a knife to eat, and even then took a little work to get the meat off the bone, and the curry potato puffs (curry flavored mashed potatoes, shaped into little semi circles, battered and deep fried), being so sweet they bordered on being candy.  For dessert we tried the Thai donuts and coconut ice cream.  Both were heavenly.  The donuts were little fried rounds of fluffy light and incredibly delicious dough that was not overly sweet, and were served with a caramel sauce which added  just enough sweetness to make them one of the most delicious donuts I've ever eaten.  I would love it if Nittaya's sold these exceptional little bites by the bag full with a generous dusting of powdered sugar as I would.buy them daily.  The coconut ice cream was served in a pretty little covered pewter bowl.  The  texture was  somewhere between an ice cream and a sorbet, and was so delicious and bursting with coconut flavor that I wished I could have bought a quart to take home.  The price for dinner for the three of us, which included several rounds of wine and beer, was $130.    Overall, I liked Nittayas and will return to try other dishes on the menu and to have those incredible donuts and coconut ice cream again.",

The first two dishes were novel and served with excellent dipping sauces. The mussels were fresh and maybe just a tad over cooked, but still pretty good and without that stale salty taste.  The shrimp and chicken were also delicious.  The one aspect I would recommend is to order the food a little at a time because it came to us quickly, but it was a Tuesday night.  I can't wait to go back-and I've lived in NYC and travel abroad (including Paris) and so I recognize a good thing when I taste it!",

Arrived at 6:15 for our 6:30 reservation. Hostess offered us a high top table next to the bar.  We would have had everyone standing and waiting to be seated practically on-top of us. So we asked for another table.  She told us that we could have another table however we would need to finish by 7:15.  .  It was 6:15. When we questioned that she left to ask someone else. Came back and pointed to a corner table across the room and stated \" you can go sit in that corner\". Never walked us over. Just pointed.  We almost walked out at that point. Glad we didn't as James apologized numerous times and provided a great dining experience. He inquired what we liked and made some wonderful recommends. James saved the day.  Would have been a 5 star except for experience with hostess.",

You almost have to disturb fellow patrons when you are being seated to your table. The decor is very cute and they have art work on the walls that can be purchased.   But, enough about the ambience. The food. Where do I even begin. The favors. The presentation. The aroma. It's all on point. This place definitely delivers a great experience. We ordered the Volcano Shrimp, Drunken Noodle, and the FOB Rice. The Volcano Shrimp was fried shrimp with Serrano peppers and a delicious sweet sauce. The shrimp arrive to your table on fire. Such a cute and fun presentation. The Drunken Noodles were noodle with chicken and basil. This dish has just the right amount of spice to it. Lastly, the FOB Rice was similar to fried rice but it had pineapple and cashews. I have always wanted to try this but thought that the cashews AND pineapple would throw everything off. Man, was I wrong. The presentation of this dish was absorbable! The rices was placed in the shell of a pineapple. For dessert we had the bread pudding. Simply delicious!",

Typically, I do the tapas so I'm able to try a few different dishes while I'm dining. Last night we had the crab wontons and firecracker shrimp. Both were amazing dishes! I really have NEVER had a bad dish at this restaurant!  Always love their infused water, last night was orange and cucumber.. delish and so refreshing.   Be aware that this is a very small and intimate restaurant. If you're looking to be loud, this is not the place to be. Also, make a reservation for dinner if you're hoping to get a table. Otherwise, decent sized bar to sit at without reservations.   I will always recommend Nittaya's and will always be back for more! :)",

I thought the prices may have been a little steep per quantity served, but perhaps maybe that's just me being a typical over-eating American.  Also, love how they decorated the place. Creativity always counts! I'll be back for sure. Next time I'll probably hang out at the bar and check out some of their cocktails. Until next time!",

This is the best Thai that I have had in a long time. We had the Coconut Seafood curry and the Drunken Noodles with chicken. Both excellent. It's a really nice restaurant, the service was terrific and the waiters were great. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Oh yeah gurl, you want to go to there.  *Calamari Lemongrass Salad *Spicy Green Bean Pork *Crying Tiger Steak *Spicy Catfish *Green Curry *Eggplant with Thai Basil *Fried Banana  I didnt eat all of that myself. I went with 3 other people and my 13 year old daughter. 2 of the guys own a world famous restaurant and they were super impressed as well. We brought a bottle of our own wine and they allowed us to do that and we were glad to pay the nominal corkage fee. We even ordered a bottle(or two? ) from their better than average wine list.  The wait staff was amazing. My daughter kept saying, \"Hey Josh, could you bring us some lettuce bowls for the pork? Can you bring me some shishito peppers?\" He catered to her like the foodie queen that she is. That in itself was impressive. Most waiters approach teenagers with a bit of awkward disdain, glancing at the mother before they feel the child's food request is valid.. Josh was amazing.   They are willing to accomadate almost any request to the best of their ability. Helpful, not hovering. It really is a secret, special place.",

The other food is also really good and it's cheaper than what I expected such a fancy looking restaurant to be although I wouldn't say it's cheap either but it's worth it. Since I go with family and friends and we always taste each other's food I can honestly say that I have yet to taste a dish that I don't like. Service is good, they infuse strawberries with the water though so if you have an allergy to it TELL THEM. Overall though it was really good.",

The food tasted different but that was not the problem. It was the service in the dining area. Everyone was nice and helpful but management apparently has them stepping over one another. The servers take the orders are are knowledgeable.THEN, they are basically finished as the bussers deliver the food! So what - right? No, not all right because the bussers don't know who ordered what and have to ask everyone what they ordered and are not able to answer questions. God help you if the order is wrong. They need to get the server to solve the problem. I feel bad for the bussers as they are not trained on the menu and shouldn't be expected to be knowledgeable on food and wine. Others in the room had quizzical looks on their faces as they tried to get answers before their food got cold. Too bad really. I won't go back with a party of three or larger.",

We had three of the small dishes: five spice ribs, secret stickers, and garlic rice. Each dish was very flavorful. The ribs were good sized and meaty and flavored with Chinese five spice. The secret stickers were much better than your average potsticker, stuffed with meat and spices, deep fried, and served with a delicious sauce. The garlic rice was buttery, redolent with the flavor of garlic, and a great taste of cilantro. I would have any of these dishes again. We went here on a whim and didn't expect it to be so pricey (the three small dishes were $27), but I would love to come back here for date night. They also have happy hour from 3-6, and half priced select bottles on Thursdays.",

Tonight I came with my family for dinner a group of 14 ppl , while everyone was already almost done eating I was the only one still waiting on my food as they brought me my food I asked them if i can take it to go  since everyone was already done . There apology was donuts I didn't even get to eat my food and they gave me donuts so basically I get donuts instead of my steak to eat . I'm not that type that expects things for free but my family thought that was really bad customer service and that they should have at least comped that one meal instead they came up to me a took the food back after it was packaged for me to take. When they were asked so what are you gonna do with the food they said \"well the owner will take it home \" when we asked to speak to her they said she wasn't gonna come out . All we really wanted was an explanation on why that even happened and to at least hear it from her but that's not what we got so I just hope that this doesn't happen to any else and they see this review as something to help them not make the same mistake .",

So switched it for the pad Thai. And waiter then said that chef couldn't comped it because we asked for no egg. But I don't understand why that's enough of an excuse for the rice to still be bland. I go to le Thai all the time and ask for no egg on top of my fried rice and it's still Amazing!!!

Entrees were the Spicy Green Bean Pork and the Grilled Skirt-Steak Avocado Curry. I'll definitely go back (and probably order the same thing because it was so damn good).

By the way if you like wine with your meals this place is great because that's all the serve not hard liquors or beer.  Would definitely go back again but make sure you reserve your table, they're a busy restaurant and you could end up waiting for a one.",

    "text": "This was the first and most likely the last time I would visit this place..When we first walked in there wasn't a host stand, very few tables and extremely tight..The look we received from the 4 people that were there and from the staff was very unwelcoming just because we had two young ones with us..it's like they were all judging us just because we weren't dressed up all fancy and had kids..One of the staff finally came up to us and asked if we had reservations and we said no..they were able to seat us right away which was nice..The server came over and he was informative about the menu and seemed pretty chipper..the busser on the other hand was extremely rude..While pouring our waters, ice cubes and water was going all over the table..Our food was as follows:  Spinach salad - something different..it was pretty good and probably the only good thing we ordered Chicken satay-4 skewers stabbed in a pineapple..very bland Lamb chops - tender but way too heavy on the sauce Tamarind shrimp - tasted nothing like tamarind..more like shrimp in fish sauce Garlic rice - it was decent Bread pudding - I don't thing it was made with bread at all..had more of a rice consistency,  too dense and no flavor..The homemade coconut ice cream was made with too much water..it wasn't creamy at all, more icy because there was too much crystallization. Also had a piece of hair but we just let it go  $100 for a couple of tapas, one small entree, and a dessert. I wish I could say it was worth it but it wasn't. To say that they're fine dining is a joke. I work in the hospitality industry at a 5 star resort on the strip and our cafe people has better standards and much better personalities than these people. To the arrogant busser who hit my hand while clearing the plates the I so neatly stacked for you just because you're too good to say a word to us like \"pardon my reach\" or anything along those lines, you suck! To all of the snooty people who give dirty looks when children are around: children are not a disease so please don't treat them like one..I'm sure each and every person was an annoying little child at some point in their life..Some even stay annoying in their old age..The only good thing I can say good about this place was the server faked being nice to us just enough to make me not flip out while there.",

This is definitely a perfect place for a date or someone to impress, it's very serene and tranquil and was just a complete relaxation from the usual (but I'm probably saying this because I went right when they opened so it wasn't overly crowded with noise and chatter.) The service was excellent, they were friendly, professional and had immaculate timing with food, refills, etc. (probably because I was one of the few there at the time but still you'd be amazed at how many restaurants suck at this). I also really liked the bathrooms, they weren't the usual dingy bathroom, it kind of felt like a hotel bathroom. I know ... a bathroom review is weird but sometimes it's just good to know.   I had the E-Haan Sausage, Calamari, Spinach Salad, Drunken Noodles and the Salmon Avocado Curry. The curry was recommended as the \"best dish ever in the city\" by the server and with that bold statement I knew it would fail to live up to expectations. It was good, not a standout but still good. The calamari was actually really good much to my surprise. It wasn't over breaded, had the perfect consistency and the sauce was spicy but sweet, a good complement.   The E-Haan Sausage was different, you wrapped it in a lettuce wrap and it had different toppings, original, good and different. The drunken Noodles tasted like...drunken noodles. Nothing outstanding, they tasted exactly what they were supposed to taste like.   I was a little confused about the hype over the spinach salad. The lime dressing is actually amazing, I love lime and I could drizzle that stuff over anything but the actual salad is just fried lettuce or tempura battered lettuce. I have an inner fat kid so anything fried tastes good, I'm not a fan of carrots but guess what's good? Fried carrots. Almost anything fried can be good so I'm not sure why this dish is overhhyped.  All in all not a bad place to check out, good environment, good wine selection, but not five stars because the food was good, but I can't see myself ever craving it or telling someone they have to go here to try a specific dish.",

After hearing about this place for years, I finally tried the secret Thai kitchen and was not disappointed. Our waitress recommended the \"favorites\" fried spinach salad and secret dumplings as starters. We tried both, I would not get the spinach salad again. Each piece of spinach is deep-fried although the lime vinaigrette is tasty this was extremely heavy and not my thing. The dumplings were OK but I probably would try something different next time as well. However we did order the chicken lettuce wraps and they were so flavorful and fresh definite must for next time. For Main's we got the Panang chicken curry and the rain forest  rice both were knockouts! The curry was light and flavorful slightly spicy and creamy. We will be returning here again!",

    "text": "Items selected:  Strawberry Lemon Water Whitefish Cake - Cucumber and sweet Chili Sauce World Famous Spinach Salad - Tempura with lime dressing and chicken Duck Breast Curry - Coconut Curry Sauce, Pineapple, Cherry Tomatoes, Thai Basil, Peppers Island Bread Pudding with Coconut Rum Caramel Sauce and Coconut Ice Cream  Sharing a city with one of the most highly acclaimed Thai restaurants in the United States cannot be easy but with Lotus of Siam's largely traditional menu routinely garnering hour-plus waits for both lunch and dinner it could also be said that Las Vegas is an ideal locale for something small, intimate, and innovative - a description defined by Chef Nittaya Parawong and her Secret Kitchen.  Featuring a style described as \"Thai Tapas\" alongside traditional curries and noodles with each dish made by Nittaya herself and served by friendly Taiwanese servers in a modern yet elegant space a meal at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a relaxed and refined affair beginning with complimentary flavored water and although the menu featured no less than a dozen items I'd have liked to try, the decision was made to start with a variety of tapas, appetizer, and curry plus dessert - each item prepared to order, ample in portion, and served with impeccable pacing.  Intentionally incorporating fish, vegetable, and meat before progressing to dessert and focusing on the more innovative options both the crispy fish cakes and the tender duck breast would prove delicious and well prepared with light sweetness acting to temper the heat and moving on to the \"famous\" salad I really have no idea how the chef manages to produce a batter so light and a flavor so vegetal but whatever the method it should be embraced, the dish one of the best things I've eaten at a Thai restaurant and without a doubt the most innovative 'salad' I've had in years.  Moving on to the dessert menu there was never really a question as to what I would order and with tender pineapple pudding rife with coconut milk custard topped off with both ice cream and caramel of the same I really cannot think of a better 'Thai' dessert, traditional or not, nor a better thing ever done with a coconut.",

We have been here 6 times since (would be more but we have small children) and every single time it has been outstanding! The atmosphere is more for date nights. It's a small, romantic and intimate setting not very ideal for bringing small children but we have! Our favorite items are the braised short rib curry, the avocado salmon curry and the whole coconut seafood curry. ALL outstanding. The secret potstickers and mussels on the appetizer menu are equally delicious. They have a 1-5 spice level you can request which is amazing because we love spicy thai food. Level 4 is perfect. You can sample different wines before purchasing which makes it nice. The menu is priced accordingly. If you want crap Thai food you'll pay cheaper prices for it. At Nittaya's, you get what you pay for! It is beyond extraordinary. We would come here a lot more if we could afford to, believe me. It's definitely a treat to come at least once a month for us. We are fortunate that we live so close. IF you don't live that close, it is worth the trip! Definitely make reservations on weekends because it gets busy. We have been fortunate not ever to wait too long for a table though. Service also is outstanding. Their infused water is so good. I can't say one thing that needs improvement here. Love it love it love it!!!!!",

    "text": "After reading the reviews and menu online, my friend and I decided to try the restaurant. When we arrived and tried to order lunch, we were told that only dinner was served on the weekends. The dinners are almost double the lunch prices. This policy regarding dinners on the weekends was not mentioned anywhere on the website. Next, there was an issue on the price of substituting brown rice for white rice. The website said there was a $1.00 charge; the menu we were given stated there was a $2.00 charge; and then the waitress stated both those were incorrect. There is actually a $3.00 charge for the substitution. At that point, I was irritated, and we left. I think the restaurant needs to accurately state policies and prices, so there aren't surprises once seated at the establishment.",

The staff are friendly and attentive, and the restaurant itself is clean, sleek, and modern with a wine bar and two intimate dining rooms. Both the red curry and basil chicken burst with flavor, also be sure to try the spicy garlic edamame. Bottom line, if you're a fan of Thai food, you're missing out if you don't try Nittaya's. While not inexpensive, prices are still on the reasonable side and the return in the quality of food and service is evident and well worth it.",

For me the ambiance was a little off putting, to dark, and missing the traditional thai feel I'm used to. Feelt alittle rushed to eat and go. Just wasn't all that impressed, seemed like a overly priced thai restaurant with ok food. With all the good comments I expected more.

It really is a secret kitchen - tucked into a small shopping complex in Summerlin, it's a great place for locals to sit down for an intimate Thai dinner. The restaurant is very small, with only 6 or so low tables, a long bar that can probably sit 6 as well, and two high tables. Because of it's size, I highly recommend making a reservation.   Their decor is spectacular and they have had many different large paintings on their back wall, I assume they change it out when it's been sold(?). I think it adds a bit of excitement to dining there, that you will typically see some new art. I can't rave enough about how much I love the atmosphere and staff at Nittaya's. It great for a date night, or dining as a family since ever dish is large enough to share.    The food here is phenomenal! I am yet to be disappointed with anything I've ordered. I usually stick to the Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, Potstickers and Rain Forest Fried Rice. The Pad Thai always comes out spicy even though I usually ask for it more mild, so watch out for that if you're not a fan of spice. Other than that, the other dishes are normally served more mild.",

I'm not familiar with this area of town, and I had no idea Rampart was closed down to one lane, I had a 5pm reservation and I ended up being 45 minutes late and they were kind enough to still hold our table, I have an obsession with time, and I'm never late, being 45 minutes late to a reservation just about threw me over the edge. They were very understanding.  Onto the review. We started out with a pitcher of red sangria, not the best I've had, lacking some flavor, but the presentation was beautiful, topped with an orchid in each glass. There were so many appetizers that I felt compelled to try, but I settled on the Koh Samui Shrimp, only because I've been to Koh Samui, quite honestly that was the only reason, coconut shrimp usually doesn't do it for me, but this was actaully really good, I liked the dipping sauce.   For my entree I ordered the young Coconut Curry, which was served inside a hollowed out coconut and served with the most amazng rice I think I've had. It was so light and fluffy, 5 stars alone just for the rice. My friend enjoyed her Tofu Pad Thai.  For dessert, or as it's listed on the website, happy endings, we shared the Ginger/Lemongrass Creme Brulee, I'm a sucker for anything ginger and/or lemongrass, the flavors really came through.   Yes you will pay a little more for the dishes here, you're not eating at Thai Food To-Go.",

They start you off with a strawberry mint water which was very refreshing. We started with the spinach salad because it was so highly recommend on yelp. No idea how they fry and tempura loose leaf spinach like that, but it was very good. A little heavy and a very large portion for two people, so we barely dented the plate but it was still delicious. It was served with a special sauce that is rich and decadent, so be sparing. The Thai tea was a must have. And we split the green curry salmon which was served with an avocado on top, eggplant and zucchini. It was large enough to split for two. We were stuffed but had to order the mango sticky rice for dessert which was in season, and which I will probably be craving for the rest of my life! It was superb! I appreciate the fact that They only have it on the menu when the mango is in season and is just right. To me, that Really shows that Mrs.Nittaya is very dedicated to her menu and her beautiful creations. I would love to meet this fantastic chef. Every plate was divine. Decorated with flowers and special care. I highly recommend. My favorite curry is yellow, or massaman,  but I had to try something different. I look forward to going back for their lunch specials and also the happy hour!!",

The spinach salad is the most ridiculous thing I've tasted could eat it all day! Penang curry was great! Papaya salad, coconut shrimp, crying tiger anything! Can't wait to go back!  One complaint is it's very busy usually. Be prepared to have a bit of chaos in the restaurant.",

I would not recommended this restaurant to any of my friends or family.   The sad part is, there were maybe 10 tables full and one individual at the bar.",

And they are precise about their timing, don't show up 15 minutes late cause they'll let the next reservation have it. Why? Because they work hard at delivering an amazing experience and awesome food. Services is perfect here. Salmon in the Green Curry sauce is a favorite of my family. They have a small wine selection, but they've chosen them well to pair with the food. You can taste the freshness and feel the love from the staff. Keep it up, you guys are all awesome!",

The peppers are like a little lottery system - there's a small chance you might get a super spicy one! They're addictive and delicious. Their Thai donuts are also quite good. Overall, this restaurant is great for almost every occasion with delicious choices for appetizers, entrees, and desserts.",

Since moving out here (5 yrs ago) I've been so disappointed with every single supposed Thai restaurant I've come across.   NITTAYA'S SECRET KITCHEN is the answer to all my food prayers. Her food gives you that warm feeling inside like it was cooked especially for you & makes you want to give the Chef a hug for such great food.   A must try is her \"WORLD FAMOUS SPINACH SALAD\" its the most DELICIOUS thing I've ever tasted. Individually tempura fried spinach served with a chicken larb... OMG! i could seriously eat this everyday.   You should also give her Pad Thai a try... its not your typical \"sour, orangie looking pad Thai\" It has the perfect balance of sweet, salt & sour   I could honestly go on forever about this place but you guys should check it out for yourself. If you're all the way on the other side, it worth the drive!!",

I notice some of the positive reviews say Nittaya's is hit or miss, but I can't bring myself to go back.  Servers here are awkward high school boys who forgot numerous parts of our order and brought things out in incorrect order (one of our apps came after we had finished entrees, drink never came, etc.), way strange for an upscale restaurant in this part of town.  Makes no sense.  Fried \"famous\" spinach salad lacked any kind of heat or flavor.  The coconut soup was boring and one note, again no flavor.  Nothing wowed us, and we tried a good assortment.  With SO many fab Thai restaurants in this city (ie. Lotus of Siam where they have an expansive menu of authentic and super memorable dishes), this should be last on anyone's list.  I'm guessing they cater to people with timid palates who want a quiet and cute atmosphere for date night and food comes secondary.  I cannot imagine a lover of Thai food coming here more than once.",

The waitress was very kind and patient in explaining the dishes. It didn't seem to have come from some rehearsed dialog, as she genuinely cared about the food and service. We chose the chicken pad thai and tapas called Golden Pouches. The pad thai was most definitely the best version of the dish that I have had in town and was a spitting image of my memory of my Thai friends' family's home-cooked pad thai. The chicken was tender and the flavors were amazing! Earthy, fresh, noodle texture was perfect and not rubbery... We ate the whole thing and when we go back again, we would easily order that dish a second time. The golden pouches are potato and curry seasoning wrapped in egg dough that is fried. They are made to look like little pouches, and they are so good, crisp, hot, and spiced! Reminded me of Christmas... Those were off the tapas menu, and were big enough to be satisfying.   The ambience was very nice, subtle decor, music from Massive Attack playing in the background... Did not have a chance to try any wines, but the selection was very decent given the size of the establishment. The bar section looked very inviting. Overall cozy feel and welcoming. Would certainly go back again to try more dishes, if only for the kindness of the staff, not to mention the quality of the food.",

Upon entering the restaurant, we felt our clothing was a bit too casual since most existing customers were dressed in business casual attire.  Nonetheless, we were greeted and received above average service. We did not have a reservation; however, due to the size of the restaurant, I would recommend making one.  The shrimp pad Thai was phenomenal!  It was the best I've ever eaten.  My husband raved about the eggplant curry, and our friend thought the basil chicken and crab fried rice were awesome.  The only reason I can't rate the restaurant as five stars is I asked the waitress to omit the egg in the shrimp pad Thai, but the meal was served with egg. Outside of that, the restaurant has great ambiance, clean restrooms and delicious food.  We have found out new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.  We WILL eat there again and again and again.",

Ten minutes went by and we didn't get even a glass of water. We ordered two appetizers and one came out after an hour and the other didn't arrive after an hour and a half. We didn't even bother to order a dinner as we didn't feel like being there for an additional 2 hours. Then they tried to charge us for the beers that we never did get. I checked my credit card statement a week later and I found that the waiter double charged my credit card on accident. When I called to speak to Nattaya she was \"too busy\" to call me back and I had to keep calling until I finally spoke to her. She told me she just didn't have time to look through her statements and she would call me back in a few days. A few days went by and a waiter ended up calling me back telling me that he would have to be responsible for the additional money that was charged on my credit card. I will never go back to this restaurant again and Nattaya should check the labor laws as she doesn't treat her staff right. Mistakes happen, but you don't make your customer feel guilty for them.

The worst part is, my husband and I  have spent many a birthday and anniversary here and have even closed the place down drinking and eating 100 year old Eggs ( Thai delicacy ) with the owner a few times in the past . This looks to be a case of a place growing too big to care about where they are from and their original customers . I understand policies change however , if you were involved with a 3rd party business during the years purchased it should still be valued. And if NOT something else should have been offered .. I asked if their was anything they could do and they denied ... I then said I wouldn't back and they didn't care. DISGUSTED. Happy birthday to me .  Angry !!",

We also ordered dessert (Bread Pudding with Coconut Ice Cream) it's do die for.  Bread pudding is home made and fresh.  Will definitely will go back and try different items on the menu.  Also customer service is amazing.",

We started with the papaya salad which was spicy and tangy sort of like biting into a freshly rained on Thai jungle.    The fried avocado was tempura style so very light and came with the most mysteriously delicious green sauce.  The shrimp skewers were seasoned in light curry and presented atop a fresh pineapple slice.  Peanut sauce seemed homemade.  The tropical chicken rice was an earthy delight.  All the ingredients were fresh and colorful without feeling heavy.  The coconut ice cream was like an angelic glimpse into what could be if I lived inside a saccharine coconut.  Still thinking about it.",

    "text": "Great ambience; contemporary and cool. Plates beautifully presented. The food vibrant and fresh. Truly representative of an eatery in Summerlin (Hawaii yeeps, think Kahala)  Authentic Thai? No. Unless you think people in Thailand eat orchids.  But a prettied up example for Western palates.  Every dish I've ever sampled has highs and lows. For example, the spinach salad that so many rave about. The tempura spinach is excellent. Crispy with just the right salinity. Perfect fresh out of the clean oil. Unfortunately a dip in the sour, herbaceous sauce muddles the flavor and does nothing but make the dish soggy.  The server recommended marinated crispy pork, very moist with deep five spice flavor, with a crisp breaded coating, tasty. When mixed with the accompanying chili sauce, the crust becomes soggy and the oil becomes pronounced.  Golden pouches, pretty, but the deep-fried wrapper is too thick to bite through, forcing you to turn it upside down and soak it in the curry to soften. All good as the pouches break open and the creamy potato taste great with the curry.  In general Curries are very flavorful. Great coconut taste well integrated spice. You won't see chili oil floating on the surface. Proteins in the curries are well cooked.  Chicken and pork are especially tender and still moist.  Conversely, sauces don't complement dishes very well. All good, it's fun getting the pork into the curry and the spinach into the chili sauce. All better flavor combinations.  Great added touches such as an orange cucumber infused water.  Service is very welcoming and off Strip friendly.  So why four stars? Simple, The food is intriguing. Take the highs of each dish, play with your food make your own combinations.  In the end, a fun dining experience.",

The food was amazing - everything was fresh, prepared to perfection and served with great presentation. I loved the short ribs and the drunken noodles. I also had the lemon grass soup. This is not your typical Thai place. Every dish has an added detail that you would not find in single $ Thai places and there are plenty of unique dishes that add to the authenticity of this restaurant. I cannot wait to go there again.  I am always focused on the quality of the food and the level of services but there one more detail that makes this place superior. The interior is very well decorated and adds to the the experience of submerging you in Thai culture. It is just perfect. Perfect for lunch or dinner.  One thing to note is that the restaurant does not have high chairs. I would not call it child unfriendly but it sure made it hard to keep the kids from digging in all the yummy food.  Did I mention that the mango sticky rice is not to be missed?!",

    "text": "Worst customer service I have ever experienced. My family and I came here a couple weekends ago and enjoyed the food (spent about $120 on the dinner, happily). We ended up, this past weekend, driving 15 miles to pick up dinner for the two of us (about $60, happily). I asked for Pad Thai with Chicken for my husband, and Pad See Ew with pork for myself. My husband is allergic to pork.  Once he started eating the pad thai, he immediately started getting sick. Throat swelled, and hives. An experience that he is, unfortunately familiar with, and is not to be mistaken. I called the restaurant, and explained to the host what happened, and was genuinely just trying to figure out what went wrong.  What follows is the most childish and sad response to a customer dispute that I can ever imagine: The self-proclaimed owner called me back, saying that she made it herself and there is no way there was a mistake. I actually began my response by saying, first off - we love your restaurant and your food. But unfortunately, he is sick and actually on his way to the hospital right now. She became extremely childish and whiny... throwing a fit and saying how she grew up making this dish in her father's restaurant (irrelevant to the situation?) and did not put pork in it. I tried to reason with her, and ask if maybe something possible could have gone wrong. She continued to be whiny and unprofessional, saying \"well if he's on his way to the hospital, why are you at home?!\" (To which I replied that I had an infant daughter at home, and my older son had to drive him).  She ended up saying something about how \"If we are so desperate for the $18 back, she'll refund it\" and abruptly hung up. I was absolutely stunned. I was not calling her for fun, or for kicks. I genuinely wanted to know what had gone wrong here. If she had been more professional and reasonable, I would not be writing this review. This entire thing was shocking, and NOT whatsoever about the money, but about the principle. We also, of course never received any sort of refund back. To the owner, I sincerely hope that you grow up, and work on your customer service skills. You can have the best food in the world, but if you treat otherwise loyal customers like this - it won't matter. Good luck to you.",

My business associate met me here and she got lost and called me for help. Tha th  with GPS. I'm tempted to say that \"Nittaya's Secret Kitchen,\" is REALLY SECRET.  Once inside you are greeted appropriately. It did take a minute of standing there awkwardly while other patrons ogle you. It is a all space. And it is busy. The decor is like a quaint village restaurant. But it is loud and chatty. The crowd are mostly 30-40s, Yuppies. (Do people still call them that?)  Food. It is good. I got the obligatory spinach \"salad\" to start, which is not really salad, but a deep fried appetizer. Tasty and inventive. The fried avocado was less successful, a bit greasy. The lamb dish I ordered was cooked well, maybe a little cloying, but that's not a deal breaker. The side of rice, which is shared, was perfect.   Dessert was not memorable (literally, I do not remember what we had!)   Overall, cool spot, with the right company. I don't think I would go here alone, except to sit at the bar. The \"cool kids\" phenom is strong with this one.",

Our table had the Muay Thai fried rice, green curry with chicken, and the short rib curry special.  They were all so delicious. The flavors were layered and complex and so well combined. Everything seemed to be bursting with freshness.  The service was good overall with some minor issues. They are the reasons for the 4-star rating instead of 5. We had a reservation and they told us that there would still be a fifteen to twenty minute wait. They ended up seating us at a table that was just outside the kitchen door. Not a big deal, but disappointing. The rest of the service was great.   I highly recommend this place.",

However I came in here for a lovely dinner and I was humiliated by the manager (young gentleman who claims he was the manager).   My wife and I had a 740 reservation,  we showed up a little early.  We had appetizers, dinner and drinks.  We were just having a conversation and the manager walked up to us and said there are 2 seats by the bar if we can move there.   I said this was kinda rude,  he said it is a policy that they can only sit someone at a table for 2 hours.  But wait,  we were not ready to go and we were only there for 45 mins and you are kicking us out?  730-815 is not close to your \"2\"hr policy.     This was humiliating and poor service,  you should be ashamed of yourself.   I hope the owner reads this and take note.....  I am VERY DISSAPOINTED !!!  From a long Time customer...",

    "text": "Stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday night with my best friend, and our daughters (1 yr & 3yr old), let me start off by saying it was busy for a week night, which is a great sign! I've been wanting to eat here for quite some time, so I was excited that we finally made to time to do so! Idealistically we both would've preferred to have just a girls night without the kids, but that's not always the case, and let's face it sometimes you have to take your babies with you! When I looked online at the reviews and  photos I didn't see any hints that it wasn't kid friendly, if I did prior, we mostly likely would've dined elsewhere.  Upon entering we were greeted, by a hostess and asked if we had a reservation, we kindly told her no, her face was very awkward looking to say the least, that's when the gentlemen said that's ok and sat us.  She gave the vibe as if bringing our little girls was not  really cool for the environment. Clearly that didn't stop us, as I said I've been wanting to eat here for quite some time. One of the other things that I was not happy about, was the face that they they have no height chairs for kids, so I had to take my stroller inside, which clearly strollers aren't always small, in an already small space.   From there everything went smooth, the service was great besides that! Our waitress and bus boys were very prompt, attentive, and made sure to clear the table on time. They also made it a point to continue to check up on us. to  After dining here I will say that is probably not  the best place to take  small kids at dinner time, they do offer lunch though! Sadly it's just not very kid friendly. I did check yelp prior to going and didn't see anything that stuck out about kids. Nittiya's is located off the strip, in Summerlin, where many people have kids, and families.  As far as the food, I can say it was fairly   good! We  ordered a few things off the menu, pot stickers, lettuce wraps, yellow curry with chicken and shrimp, as well as the Thai noddles with basil and chicken. Not many complaints,  I will say that the potstickers were nothing special, they tasted like something you would order at Samurai Sam's. The curry flavor was different for me in pineapple fried rice , but it was still very good, we enjoyed it, as well as the lettuce wraps.  I do think the yellow curry with chicken & shrimp could've  been a bit more tender, it was dry and a little tough for my liking. Maybe it needed a longer simmer, but I'm no chef.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, I felt like we were in Thailand, from the decor all the way to to menu! Oh and there is a bar, you can have dinner there as well! Another plus is the versatile menu, there are so many options!   The food was a 7/10 for me. I would for sure stop in again, just not with my kids. Still height chairs are always helpful for people dining with kids, and I do hope the hostess is friendlier next time!",

That was very nice of her so we got seated within 2 mins! The customer service was friendly and professional! The food we ordered took less than 10 mins, keep in mind the place was full cause of the lunch rush hour, but we didn't have to wait long for the food! The was food was outstanding!

Next we had the coconut bouillabaisse which had a nice creamy broth and tons of chunky fresh seafood which I was surprised with. It was delicious.   Papaya salad was next and it had some large shrimps which I appreciated. The tangy sauce is always my favorite but I was expecting a bit more of a lime juice flavor.   Crying tiger wasn't my favorite. The meat texture wasn't the best and it was a both chewy and fatty. I would not recommend getting this.   Chicken Thai wings was delicious. The skin was lightly crispy that it reminded me of crispy duck. The hot sauce paired with it was spicy!   Soft shell crab was full of flavor. Tangy from the lime and fish sauce. Crunchy from the diced apples and the red onions added a nice pickled flavor.   Shishito peppers were phenomenal. Slightly soft and blistered nicely. This dish was prepared simply but yet it was addicting.   Fried spinach who would have thought? It was so deliciously fried that you keep wanting more. I could eat my vegetables like this every day! The dipping sauce was a nice balance to the oily crispy spinach.   Last but not least we had the King noodle with ground chicken. Lots of flavor and sweetness.   Ended the night with the Thai donuts and coconut creme brulee and wasn't disappointed. Every dish here had so much flavor and it's not your typical Thai food. I can't wait to be back and can't thank our friends for sharing this hidden gem with us.",

Very much a fancy Thai place, maybe even fusion? Either way it was great, but don't expect greasy takeout style food (not that there's anything wrong with that). This is a white linen tablecloth kind of restaurant, without being snooty. Would probably be great for date night too!",

Flavors for all were spot on, the tempura batter was perfect.  For the take out we just reheated a little in oven for a few minutes on the avocado and shrimp and it did not ruin the tempura.  We also microwaved the drunken noodle just a little bit and did not spoil the texture of noodles. Just noting here in case you live a little distance and are concerned on reheating. Looking forward to trying some other dishes.  Thank you Nittaya for creating great dishes!! You are a gem!",

Oh wait almost forgot the lemon Grass soup the best I've ever had at a restaurant ... Last but not least I Totally recommend the spinach salad ..

There is a quieter room in the back which also looked inviting. We ordered two appetizers based on reviews and were not disappointed: the spinach salad and the spare ribs. The spinach tempura salad was perfection with an ideal lime dressing. I would say that it was the best tempura dish I have ever had. The five spice sauce on the ribs was also perfect. Both had excellent after tastes that lingered on. The lunch salad was ample with a wonderful light rice vinegar based dressing. Our main dishes were also delicious and of course, we were too full to eat them all. They tasted great the next day. One was a glass noodle dish with lots of veggies snd the other had flat rice noodles with chicken. Standard fare but very tasty sauces. We cannot wait to return to try other dishes.",

The only reason I removed a star was due to the limited menu but I assure you everything on the menu deserves 5 stars. The spinach salad seems to be everyone's favorite and with good reason. I had the pad see ew, fried rice, and spicy basil chicken. This place seems to only use the freshest ingredients and the customer service was excellent. It is indeed a bit pricey but that should be expected from a place that serves only the freshest produce on its menu. The atmosphere was intriguing with the mood lighting being very dim. The comfort was tight but not crowded. I will definitely be returning back because they certainly know how to treat their customers unlike some of the other local businesses in town that I posted negative reviews for.   Make sure you check those reviews out and stay far away from them!",

It was clear that customer service is a huge priority for the employees at this establishment.   In regards to the food, the crab wantons were incredible. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A great suggestion from our waitress. Also, the Bangkok Fried Rice was an incredible addition as well. It had an excellent combination of savory flavors.    I would highly recommend Nittayas Secret Kitchen and will absolutely be back.",

I'd suggest trying all the appetizers so you can get an idea of how good it is.  The fried spinach plate is incredible, if you want a starter, that is the one.  I've tried about 60% of the entire menu and most of it was incredible.  The only dishes that were average were the short ribs and braised beef.  Some of the items come with a spicy sauce, but medium has a nice kick, not too hot.  They have a nice wine selection as well. Enjoy!",

As I ate lunch in your restaurant today, I noticed that all four tables sitting around me ordered your famous tempura spinach salad - The same one I am taking my time with. I brought the spinach and sauce into the office to share with my engineers. They all loved the taste. Absolutely divine. The curry aroma war unforgettable. The people near me order the salmon after their world famous spinach appetizer. The service was wonderful. Even the water - The simple glass of H2O water had flavor as the waiter told me that the water had been prepared that day with oranges and strawberries. Each day the water is different. Some days the water has fresh cut limes or cut green cucumbers with lemon. You can't take a drink without bringing out flavor. I have to return with my family for the curry dishes with the salmon. We never heard of you. Your restaurant is across town from us, but we were at a shredding event with Councilman Bob Beers this morning at the Veteran's Memorial near Costco and I said, \"I have to cover a restaurant review today. Name a great restaurant around here. What do you recommend?\" Without hesitation, Councilman Beers asked, \"Do you enjoy Thai dishes? Try Nittaya's Secret Kitchen on Rampart and Lake Mead.\" Your menu was worth the drive. Each bite is inspirational: Spinach prepared with the texture of Japanese tempura but served with a delightful oil and vinegar sauce combining cashews, fresh shredded carrots, green onions rolls, red onions, herbs and oils. Delicious with the shrimp pad thai noodles. After eating, I still had enough to take to the office and eat now for dinner at nine o'clock at night. I wish I lived near Rampart Blvd. After leaving to see the patio dining outside, I went next door to discover the olive oil tasting at Big Horn Olive Oil Company. The bottles of olive oil and vinegar reminded me of the wineries in the Santa Barbara Wine Country. I learned about recipes from owner, Julie Young, and walked out with a gift for my friend's Purim celebration.",

Everyone should DEFINITELY request Zack!!  Also, we definitely have to thank Josh who works behind the bar. Like Zack, he was also very attentive and checked to make sure we were enjoying our wine and our experience. Josh and Zack are both extremely nice and humble guys who really cared to make sure we had an awesome experience!! I have to say that Amy and I visit a lot of restaurants and the service we had tonight is some of the BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!! Thank you so much to Zack and Josh for a job well done.

We ordered a ton of food tonight including drunken noodles with tofu, fried avocado, spinach salad, ribs, pad thai, edamame, and chicken fried rice. The drunken noodles were for me, usually it comes with chicken but since I don't eat chicken they were able to substitute it with tofu. My other favorite thing from here is the fried avocado. I really can't think of anything I like more than fried avocados. If you were to dine in the restaurant it is a bit nicer than other Thai restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas. It's definitely a great spot for date night or girls night. The restaurant is pretty small, so I would recommend making reservations if you were to go on the weekend. Also, this place is very vegetarian friendly!",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it is treated as an upscale restaurant.I highly recommend coming in for lunch because their lunch specials are so much cheaper and they are just as amazing! Even ordering to go is smooth. I highly recoupment the pan fried noodles, the drunken noodles, the spring rolls, and the mango sticky rice!",

While the location is in Summerlin and a bit of a drive from the Strip, I promise that it is totally worth the drive.  The decor is chic, contemporary and service impeccable. I come for both lunch and dinner and it's always extraordinary. My favorite things to devour here is a long list but take note you'll want to try every thing.  So here it goes:  Coconut soup, citrus steak salad, papaya salad, shrimp pad Thai, crying tiger steak, drunken noodles, cashew shrimp, catfish, eggplant, FOB rice, the beignets, Thai donuts and creme brulee. I'm sure I missed a ton of other things but trust me when I tell you, you will be back.  LOVE THIS PLACE!",

The first was with friends who recommended it, the second was with coworkers I recommended it to and the third was to pick up take out for my partner who has not eaten here yet.   I am giving them 5 Stars not only for their delicious and incredibly flavorful food or the great atmosphere but specifically for their impeccable customer service.   Tonight, after coming home and checking my take out order, I realized they had forgotten the dressing for the spinach salad (which I highly recommend). The dressing that comes with this salad is one of the best things on the menu and so I called to let them know it had been forgotten. I explained that it was a 40 minute drive round trip and coming back wasn't possible so this restaurant had one of their servers drive to my home to bring it to me! I have never experienced such a service! Thank you Nittaya's for making sure my order was right and going above and beyond.   The drunken noodles, pad Thai, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, chicken Panang, Thai donuts and mango sticky rice are all on my list of things you should try!   I'll be returning soon!",

We had the Spinach Salad (of course!), volcano shrimp, Cashew Shrimp and Chicken Masaman Curry. Every single dish was delightful. The flavors of the cashew shrimp were bright and slightly spicy. The curry was creamy, slightly spicy and rich. An OMG the spinach salad was insanely addicting.  If you are in Summerlin this is a fantastic relaxed date night spot or a great gathering spot with friends. Also, Thursday night is half price bottles of wine and they do have a happy hour from 3-6p, I believe.",

Nittaya's Secret Kitchen was on the top of the Yelp list, so I had to come here and try it myself.   We ordered the spinach salad, coconut seafood curry, fried pork belly, FOB pineapple rice, and shrimp pad Thai. It was one of the most unique Thai food experiences I've had with all the flavor in every bite as well as the dim ambiance of the restaurant.   I loved the music playlist that they had on as well, it was a bunch of pop songs covered in an acoustic style, so that was pleasant to listen to while enjoying my lunch.",

The ambiance is very nice, clean, and modern. The wine wall is a nice touch too. When we sat down we were immediately greeted with infused cucumber/apple water, it was soooo refreshing. I think I had like 5 glasses lol. Next we ordered the following: -Siamese (pork) egg rolls -coconut seafood curry  -crab fried rice -panang shrimp curry -chocolate banana beignets Everything was soooo delicious and spiced perfectly I was in pregnant lady heaven. I enjoyed every part of our meal. I wish I can say which dish was my favorite but I really enjoyed them all. My husband doesn't care for curries but he really enjoyed the panang curry from here. Now the service, this place has the best damn service I have ever experienced in my 28 years of life!!!! My glass was never empty, they checked on us throughout the meal, took plates away when we were done with them throughout the whole course and it just wasn't one person. It was everyone who worked there taking care of us. I loved it here! Definitely give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed.",

We forgot we were angry about waiting so long. The Lemongrass Soup was absolutely delicious. Best soup so far among Thai restaurants in the area. It had all the traditional elements strained out as well, such as bay leaves, galangal root. The Fried Avocado was great. But not memorable. The dip was the best part. The Curry was a clear winner. DELICIOUS. The ambience is great. Very rustic. The menu is perfect.",

My friend got the fried rice and substituted tofu for the meat cause she's vegetarian. We also got the Conquista Argentinian Reserve Malbec to share. Service is good. Bar tender was great.

We ordered a ton of appetizers and they were all well prepared, tasty, and fresh.  We followed with entrees, which were also excellent.  The service was fantastic, with refills and plates cleared regularly.  They lost their 5th star because they do not have high chairs, that made it difficult with a toddler.  Although small kids may not be their target demographic, having a couple high chairs might be a good idea.  Nice place for Thai food.",

The inside of the restaurant was really cute and cozy, much nicer than most Thai restaurants. It almost felt like a fancy restaurant.   Our waitress and the rest of the staff were friendly and attentive. We didn't have to wait long for food and someone was by with water frequently.   The Secret Stickers from the impressive tapas menu were delicious. The basil chicken filling was nicely flavored and the dumpling had a nice texture. I liked that they weren't greasy despite being fried.   Shrimp Pad Thai was my favorite of our two entrees. The Pad Thai had an excellent flavor, one of the best I've had recently. The shrimp were large, well cooked, and didn't have tails to make them easy to eat. One difference here from other Thai restaurants was that we weren't asked about spice level and the dish wasn't spicy. We didn't think the flavor needed any tweaking though.   The F-O-B Rice was good and beautifully presented. I think on a future visit I'd skip this and go for a spicy dish though. All of the ingredients in the rice were well prepared with a hint of curry. Most pineapple fried rices I've had are savory with the pineapple adding sweetness, but this dish had an overall sweet flavor. Again, well prepared and would be an excellent choice for someone craving a sweet dish.",

I didn't feel like drinking wine tonight but I definitely will come back to drink some wine. Everything was so delicious and perfect. Our server did good too. Our water was always refilled without being asked.  The spinach salad was yummy. The sauce was AMAZING. I could just drink the sauce lol. The steak was so tender and cooked perfectly. The pad Thai was delicious as well. They gave us plenty of shrimp which was great. This is definitely my new favorite Thai restaurant!",

I didn't like the concept it was hard to get a really good look at the menu. The decor had a really homey feel and love their wine board in back of the bar. I ordered the garlic endame and basil chicken entree. The endamne was good but nothing special. I would have liked a little more spices. The basil chicken was awesome! I ordered it mild so it had just a little kick but the sauce was just right. The plum wine was good as well. Also the spinach salad is amazing especially the sauce. It is a must for your appetizers. Overall the experience was great and nice spot for lunch if you want Thai. I will be back!",

    "text": "Wow!!! This place is amazing!  I had asked a friend out to dinner and he informed me to select the location for the evening. I decided to try Nittaya's Secret Kitchen!  I was quite impressed. I arrived at the restaurant at approximately 5:50 P.M on a Friday evening. I didn't realize that you needed to call in advanced for a reservation, especially on a Friday or Saturday evening. The hostess though, was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! She was able to accommodate us and moved a few tables around to get us in, otherwise, it would have been a hour long wait! She had asked us if we would be done in a hour and a half, which, no problem, we would be :).  We didn't order any appetizers or drinks. The main courses we selected was he Massaman Curry and the Pan Z U Noodle. I typically despise coconut flavor, but the Massaman Curry, which is cooked with Coconut was so good! I would get the dish again! The Pan Z U Noodle was flavorful as well! The first byte I took, just made me feel so happy! You can't go wrong ordering either of those two dishes at this restaurant!   We also ordered a few desserts. I let my friend surprise me. He had ordered the fried banana and the Eggnog Creme Brulee. My friend really enjoys Creme Brulee and the Eggnog was special order since it was still on their menu for the Holidays.   The Eggnog Creme Brulee was... interesting to say the least.. My friend liked it, but I didn't typically care for it. Eggnog is a acquired taste! If you like Eggnog, you'll love the Eggnog Creme Brulee!  The fried banana, my friend enjoyed as well. I didn't like it, just because the batter was deep fried in coconut. I don't like the flavor of dried coconut. If you like coconut, the friend banana is, for sure, for you!  Portion size is large and the price wasn't particularly expensive either for the food.  The ambience in this restaurant is very romantic! Great for a date night or a get together with friends/family! The customer service was out of this world!",

When we first arrived we thought it was going to be more of a take-out place, but right away I checked Yelp again, and under Ambiance, \"romantic.\" So it turns out my sister and I ended up having a sit down, sister date that day.  We tried their pork belly under the tapas section and it did not disappoint. It was crispy and had a really good flavor. Next up where our pad thai and Penang curry. The portions are sizeable so the prices weren't as scary when they plates arrived. The pad thai was great, but I felt like the noodles were too chewy for my taste. Sister loved it though. The Penang curry was also very good, but I wished there was a little more spice/flavor to it.  Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back. The ambiance was great, and the food was pleasant.",

Nittaya's serves really good, really unique twists on Thai food. In a really nice atmosphere.  The six of us ordered a boat load of apps and a few mains. What really stood out:  Fried Spinach Salad <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FMSic8EzessAcDaQ9YupFxg%2Fo.jpg&s=3a8737ded710cda7c3b59f90dced3667b413dabb9ecb6e77978ad507767e3003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>. Sounds totally weird tastes incredibly awesome. Hints of parmesan. Great dipping sauce. Crunchy flavor. Get it.  Bacon wrapped shrimp <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fi66DD1m0qD0qRxrt6gYMMQ%2Fo.jpg&s=6165c51d59ef0c739224a7beedee374e30ce51fa8b7df70589dbe761d028703e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>. Large juicy shrimp wrapped in bacon? C'mon the marriage of both these is fantastic. Salty, porky, crispy, juicy....you can tell I like this one....it's good!!!  Thai BBQ chicken wings <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FHLqsMupLRsFlrxDD6yATjQ%2Fo.jpg&s=0bfc22e3be977ccdb4c98100a5790d0389c4133d8a17fc3b422f615fcaba16db\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>.  Meaty little wings that are cooked to perfection but what really sets them apart (and why I am recommending them)....the Dipping sauce is liquid crack...hot but not too hot, spicy but not too spicy...the flavor comes through and marries well with the wing.  Corn Fritters <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FMTX84aeeMkw130tqdmJn3A%2Fo.jpg&s=ab899f9dee62acf8cfaf1eb6ec2cfdde068da2d800998393aa53f8e09233ff04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a> are a great vegetarian option and have the right balance of texture and taste. The dipping sauce is also really good.  Five spice spare ribs <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F5CAx3q-dcmGKDh3SZ1CU6w%2Fo.jpg&s=6869fb22c5fc8e13579a97c7ac0bc2146b1655f68fcbbba3bb326cc3eaf3a33d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>. Anything five spice ( which is actually I thought a Vietnamese thing) is great but when you take a wonderful piece of meat, rub it with five spice  and cook it perfectly ....get it!  Actually every dish was good.  Service was pleasant but not really personable.  Prices are moderate.  Good wine and beer list.  If you are in this area check out Nittaya's!!!",

This usually tells me that it isn't authentic. On top of that a Thai worker there asked us if we were from out of town or local? Why would you ask that if you seen many Thai's as customers? I felt that they don't see many Thai's which simply mean it's not authentic or good enough for Thai's to eat.   We ordered Pad Thai shrimp, Pad Kee Mao drunken noodle) chicken, Pad See Eew Chicken, Som Tham (Papaya salad), Chicken Satay and Tom Yum Chicken.  Problems: Everything was over salted or bland. We ordered chicken satay, Tom Yum Chicken and papaya salad to go. Papaya salad didn't have the necessary 3 flavors that it's suppose to have. Sweet, salty and sour. Bland as hell. Chicken Satay didn't come with the usual cucumber sauce and peanut sauce. Missing or just wasn't included which would be wrong serving it in the first place. Tom yum didn't have lemon grass or kaffir leaf taste. Bland.   Only thing that was good because any monkey can make is sticky rice. You can have one star for that one. Take heed and correct.",

We ordered the spinach, lemon grass soup, garlic edamame, corn fritters, and secret stickers. Seriously- it was alll sooooo good. I can't wait to go in person and will definitely order again.  One thing I did find sad- all of their curry dishes have half and half  hopefully they'll have one with only coconut milk or broth soon.",

    "text": "We decided to get the heck off of the strip for our last evening meal.  Best decision ever made.  We found Nittaya's based on decent Yelp reviews, hubby's choice, and he hit it out of the ball park again. (so far, all of his out-of-town Yelp food picks have been winners so I suppose I'll keep him around!)  Bulletted thoughts: -Super tiny space, fills up fast, definitely make reservations even if they are last minute.  We did and got two seats at the bar (we're not picky, we're there for the food!) -Great service, even sitting at the bar  We Chose Tapas Plates All Around: -Avocado fries---Yes -Spinach Salad---Hell Yes -Beef Jerky---super salty/umami chewy chunks of beef--do it for something different -Mango Shrimp--Yes  -Coconut Sticky Rice Dessert had some of the freshest, softest most wonderful mango I've ever put in my mouth.  (Probably because I live in Buffalo NY and the only mangoes we ever see are hard-as-a-rock, funky, nasty, bitter things.) Hell-to-the-yes!!!  -A must-eat if you're into Thai.  We will recommend this to anyone traveling to LV who wants a taste of life outside of the strip (read: much more reasonably priced food done by someone whose not a rock-star celebrity chef who likely has no idea what's going on in their corporate kitchen)",

Glass noodle salad is great.  All the rice dishes are very good. Lamb chops are to die for!  Basil chicken is another great dish. Too many to list. The only disappointment is that Nittaya does not come out of the kitchen. We've been coming here for years and we don't know her. Otherwise amazing place.

The rice was completely mushy and flavorless!  We sent it back and ordered the chicken Pad Thai (which is actually really good).

I'm hoping to eat at it again (hint hint :-)) I absolutely love the spinach salad which to me is more like spinach tempura.  I also love the Tofu Masamam Curry - I am not a big tofu person but my sister is and so I reluctantly tried this.  SO good! I have tried the Green Curry with Shrimp but it was too spicey for me (regardless I ate it but my mouth burned).  Their prices are a bit high but definitely worth it and I tend to be kind of frugal when I order food - but hey - this place is worth it.  Friendly enough staff (whenever I ordered my to gos, I chatted with the bartender) and pretty ambience - didn't take pics but it has a nice cozy feeling inside.   There is a main room with a bar then another room behind it that is bigger.  There is also wonderful art work around the restaurant by a local artist who's named I forgot (sorry) but he does beautiful and bright abstract paintings. Outdoor seating is available when the weather is nice - keep in mind that Nittaya's is in the middle of a parking lot but Nittaya's does a good job of having beautiful outdoor furniture with high surrounding bushes to distract you from that not too far places like Bank of America :-)",

Have had the bacon wrapped shrimp, chili lime squid (?) and pork belly. Those were good but nothing crazy.  Try the first two dishes i mentioned and youll be set.

    "text": "Nittayas is by far the nicest, classiest...and most expensive Thai food restaurant I've visited!  I'm pretty sure this was the first time I've ever been asked if I had a reservation...for lunch...for Thai food lol.  And it was the only time I've ever felt self conscience for my 2 year old Little Foodie Dude eating with me during lunch!  It is very chic, glamorous and date night appropriate! Service was great as well...and food was outstanding...but you'll pay for it!  Coming here during lunch is a great deal! They have $11 lunch specials (yes, expensive compared to others around $5-7 range) but they are packed with flavor and use quality ingredients...you really can taste the difference! The lunch specials also come with a house salad and pot sticker which were both pretty good.  Portions are decent as well, so you should leave satisfied :)  I went with my standard Drunken Noodles aka Pad Kee Mao. This was an excellent rendition, with lots of flavor even with chicken instead of pork! I love chinese broccoli, so I was excited to see it in the dish! I asked for it extremely spicy though, and what I got was a 1/10 on my scale...I should have sent it back, but it was soo good even without the spice!   Also tried their version of Pad Thai. Surprisingly, this was more spicy than the request for 10/10! I really liked their version of this dish, and is probably the best Pad Thai I've ran into so far, although I don't often order this dish.  But what if you don't come here during lunch? Expect to pay $16 for drunken noodles ala carte. They had $15 desserts on the menu. Yes, there are some cheaper alternatives, but I don't even remember seeing $15 desserts in some of the best steakhouses in town!  But you need to check this place out if you are a Thai food lover...just go during lunch IMO!",

    "text": "This little place is beautiful, with just the right lighting to make it a special romantic hideaway. That also makes it a little difficult to read the price-gouging wine list, where a glass of Riesling goes for $12 for one brand and $10 for another. I think Nittaya has lost sight of the fact that this is a neighborhood restaurant nowhere the Strip.   The waitress, whose English made her nearly impossible to understand, did a good high-pressure job of pushing the Tempura Spinach Salad appetizer, and we were glad she did. It was outstanding, though it's now $11, not the $9 previously reported.  Our party of four also ordered the Fried Avocado  appetizer and the Shrimp Patties, but the waitress brought the wrong shrimp appetizer, saying they had similar names.  She changed it cheerily.  The avocado was very good, but the shrimp patties were ordinary and greasy.   For our main course, my husband and I shared a Chicken Musaman Curry, served with a side of jasmine rice. This was the only dish that didn't have an elegant presentation. It was good - not the best, but certainly not the worst Musaman I've had - but could have benefited from less sauce and more chicken. They didn't offer it with beef, which I like better.   The other couple had much bigger appetites, ordering Salmon in an Avocado Curry, a Crab Fried Rice, and Catfish in an unidentifiable reddish sauce. She liked her salmon, he hated his catfish, and the fried rice was lukewarm.   With visions of Yogurtland dancing in our heads, we bypassed dessert here.   If we were to return, we'd probably order just from the appetizer/tapas menu. But then again, almost everything on that menu is either fried, stuffed with cream cheese, or both. We'd probably be best off leaving that kind of food for the younger set.",

    "text": "A Thai friend and I decided to try this joint out since it received such good reviews.  We went at around 5 pm expecting the dinner crowd but to our surprise there were only 7 people total in this place.    This place is so small that the person sitting the farthest away can hear your conversation.  If you have any form of Claustrophobia, please stay away.  The decor is very dark, but suitable for a wine/beer bar.   This may be considered \"hole in the wall\", but its nothing close to that description.  Its located at Rampart & Lake Mead which has huge plazas at all four corners and a lot of traffic.  The wait staff was 2 young White males who had the attitudes of, \"what time is it, and when can I go home?\"  But what can u expect from kids who have no idea what customer service is about.  The other was a young Asian female who took our order.  She was very nice, but the language barrier came into play when asking questions.  The Food:  We had to try this \"famous\" spinach salad.  Ummm people, its fried battered spinach with a salsa sauce that tastes like the dressing for papaya salad.  Only in 'Merica can we take something healthy and ruin it.  Think of potato chips and dip people, there is no \"Salad\".     My entree was Green Curry, vegan.  I asked for more veggies since im not eating any expensive animal protein.  That was not the case or (language barrier).  It tasted like plastic and was basically a bowl of bamboo shoots.  There was only 7 little pieces of bell pepper in it.  Why am I paying 15$ for this again?  When I asked the waitress about it, she got very defensive/annoyed, and did not even try to see my point of view.  I also chose brown rice (which is an extra charge) but it was too mushy. (Used too much water cooking it).    My friend's entree was pad-Z-U, vegan, which was just as bad.  Swamped in oil even after asking to use smallest amount of oil.  Very little veggies that had no flavor.  it was also too spicy for her, but then again they never asked.  They never asked us how spicy we wanted the dishes...wow seriously?  THEY ARE NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY!  We did find out Nittaya's Secret though!  Its called charging a fortune for low quality bastardized Thai food...and then retire and laugh at all you suckers!  The prices are just silly...I dont mind paying 15$ for green Curry if everything is organic, but for a small bowl of spicy plastic, no thanks.  I just wanna know why am I paying this price?  Oh the \"Tapas\" ripoff idea....yeah so their tapas (very small) portions are the same price as a normal size entree from any other asian foodie place.  There is no reason to pay these prices.  WARNING: Although we voiced our concerns to the waitress and we only ate a few bites of each item, they never offered to to remove them from the bill (other than the mushy brown rice) which tells me they are all about the dollar.  They just don't seem to care  Most other Thai takeout is way better than this place.  Quality of food, service, and price.",

Service was excellent. Menu seemed a touch pricey however, l will return to try some other stuff again.",

My favorites are the spinach salad, crying tiger steak, avocado salmon.... and there is a special \"off-menu\" item that is made with clear noodles which may be the best thing at the entire restaurant.  Also, the soups and salads are amazing - particularly the lemongrass chicken soup.  Thursday's evenings are a bonus since wine bottles are 50% off!

I've heard nothing but fabulous reviews about this little restaurant, and Nittayas did not disappoint. They offer an array of tapas and thai entrees. The Ahi tuna was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. The soft shell crab and green apple salad was refreshing and a new dish for me, but I loved it. I also had to try the fried avocado which left me wanting more with its creamy, crunchy texture. By the tune my spicy basil eggplant entree came out I was stuffed and only able to eat a few incredible bites before throwing in the towel.  I cannot wait to go back to this little gem. Oh and did I mention their staff is delightful?!",

On the way from Death Valley to my hotel, I called the the restaurant around 9:15pm and they said to come on down, even though they close at 10pm.    First, the excellent customer service - I got there at around 9:35pm, but they were very welcoming and not for a moment did I feel that they were in a hurry for me to leave. Very nice!  I ordered a green chicken curry but with extra vegetables - they were happy to oblige. The vegetables were actually the star of the show - perfectly cooked, for each type of vegetable they put in - perfect balance of firm and tender.  And they did not skimp  on the quantity or variety   - mushrooms, green beans, carrots, broccoli, egg plant.    The curry itself was of just the right  consistency-  not too thick and not watery, with just the right amount of heat and deep, complex flavor.  Just to note, the quantities are very generous- enough for two.     Finally, I ordered the donuts which had just right amount of sweet to end the day.    Highly recommended and well worth the money.",

Highlights of the menu: \"beef jerky\", served with a side sauce that is to die for, spiced edamame. no idea what all is in the seasoning but it will make your mouth happy, spinach salad is great, it's all over reviews but it's the dressing that makes the dish, you could put it on anything.  The staff is pretty fun, Lea is our favorite but everybody is super helpful and good spirited. One more note, this is an all events restaurant, date night, yes, family dinners, yes, dining with friends yes.  There isn't an event that wouldn't work here.

We ended up ordering the signature spinach leaves appetizer and some red curry shrimp. Spinach was greasy and shrimp was too spicy.  Service at the bar was very formal and attentive but the restaurant was quiet and everyone was on a date night.  So we probably didn't pick the best place to come and have a girl's night.   When we were waiting for the check I decided to \"check in\" on Yelp.  I usually check in after I leave a place and I noticed there was a Yelp Deal.   One free glass of Sangria with check in woo-hoo! Right?  WRONG!  Mr. Four-Seasons Bartender suddenly turned Motel 6 and wouldn't honor it.  (He's the blonde guy with glasses) He said I should have told him that when we first got there. Huh?

We ordered drunken noodle and cashew chicken. Cashew chicken does not even taste like cashew chicken. Not even a cashew in sight.  Flavors were off and had to ask waiter where was the cashew in the cashew chicken. Ask why cashew chicken does not taste like cashew chicken. Waiter said this is how cashew chicken taste like here. Major dehydration afterwards. Prepare to drink lots of water.  Ask waiter how much it was to substitute shrimp for chicken.  He said 2 to 3 dollars. End up paying more than three dollars to substitute the meat. Asked him why it was over three dollars( despite asking him in advance )he said it could be anything.   I guess you should have him write it down on paper before substituting any type of meat here. They will charge you whatever they feel like. Don't come here if you don't want to get rip off for unauthentic Thai food and overpay.",

I stuck with the two dishes I normally order when first trying out a Thai restaurant which is pad Thai and yellow curry. The pad Thai was solid but like most Thai restaurants the chicken was chewy and dry. I wanted a yellow curry but did not see it listed on the menu so I asked the gentleman serving us. He said the yellow curry is the Massaman curry. I have been to ample Thai restaurants and have never had a Massaman curry that is yellow in color. Another thing I did not understand is why brown rice substituted for white rice that comes with an entree is the same price as a side of brown rice. This policy does not make sense and the quality and taste of the food I have tried does not warrant the high prices.",

My wife and I came in for a late lunch and upon first impression of the interior of the place was it was tidy, quaint and pleasantly decorated.  The soft lighting brings you into an atmosphere private dining.  Many things sounded good to me but my wife is a vegetarian so she stayed away from the dishes that included meat.  I nearly ordered the FOB Rice (Fresh Off the Boat pineapple rice) - which after speaking to someone about the place later found out is awesome, but I decided to try the chicken satay and the cilantro beef skewers.  The Chicken Satay was very good while the beef as good, but nothing to write home about.   My wife had a spinach salad that had tempura battered spinach and a citrus/cashew dressing sauce on the side.  I should point out that this dish normally comes with chicken but they told her she could elect to have it with tofu instead or without either entirely (which she elected).  I tried it and it was very interesting and tasty.    We also ordered Garlic Edamame which was fantastic.  It had a great garlic flavor and they put in Serrano peppers as well in there which is a twist we had not tried before.  That waters served were infused with flower and strawberry very lightly- which gave it a hint of flavor and I had also ordered a Tropical Iced Tea which was great.  Overall, a very pleasant dining experience for about $20 for each of us.  I am definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Last night we dined at Nittaya's.  The food was good but I did not leave \"in love\" as usual.  We started off with our usual-\"THE\" Spinach Salad.  The Spinach was light & crispy but the dressing seemed different-I can not exactly identify what was different.  I usually can not stop eating it but after 3 bites I was satisfied.  We also ordered the Fried avocado appetizer which was very tasty-the avocado was smooth and buttery and rich.   I ordered the Beef Pad Z U (their spelling).  It just did not taste \"right\" to me (not bad, not horrible though).  My husband tasted it-thought the meat was chewy but declared it \"ok\".  We took it home.  He ordered the Duck Curry which he declared \"pretty good\".  One friend ordered the Salmon Curry which she liked.   Our other friend ordered the ribs which he loved.    One con about this otherwise delightful place is the seating.  I am not a tiny person and have no one to blame but myself.  That said, the tables are so tightly placed as is the bar \"area\".  People generally will scootch their seat back and the people at the bar scootch their seat back.  Our party was already seated in the back and all avenues to get to our table were blocked with patrons having their seats back just a little BUT since the tables are so close together it was almost virtually impossible to get to our seat.  I noticed all of the very slender servers and staff having to turn sideways and such to get back and forth between the tables. (So of course my sizable ass was not getting through without a chair or something being moved).  After dinner we felt almost trapped at our table and did not feel comfortable trying to leave until the table behind us cleared.    The service was wonderful as usual.",

    "text": "On the way back from DTLV, I stopped at Nittaya's for linner.  It was about 1 PM and during the time when the lunch specials were in effect.  $11 for a variety of lunch dishes that includes a pot sticker, and salad, and the dish of your choice from the list of noodle or rice dishes.  I opted for the green curry chicken with rice.  The menu had a notation that the dish was one of their spicy dishes--just what I wanted.  They did not ask for a hotness number I wanted such as a scale of 1-5 or 1-10.  It was made the way they make it.  First up, I was brought a pot sticker and a small salad.  The pot sticker was OK.  Nothing special and a bit soft on the bottom from the sauce on/under it negating the frying of the dumpling.  The salad was great with the flavor of rice wine vinegar being very prevalent.  The curry was very good and I was surprised that it had the zing it had.  Most places that indicate a dish is spicy with a small pepper or some other notation aren't really my spicy level--they're too mild.  This had a bit of zing. More would have been better but this was OK.  Service was good throughout.  I had never been here before, so when I walked in and saw the bar, I sat there because I was dinging solo.  It was only after my eyes got acclimated to the darkened interior that I realized there were two rooms.  It's quite a nice restaurant.  Service was very good.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lunch special pricing at $11 is higher than other Asian restaurants doing lunch specials and I didn't see anything different about the quality of my lunch compared to other places I've been.  Nittaya's is worth another try for the evening menu.  There are some good sounding items I need to taste.",

As there was a couple next to me that ordered shortly before me but receive their food and was packing up there to go bag and paying to get ready to leave.

So they delivered the dish to our house, free of charge!   We kinda expected to pay for the dish and was just happy they were delivering it, so that was a pleasant surprise....   Not just going out of their way to make customers happy, but this food is awesome, try it if your nearby",

We started out with a bunch of tapas...the best one was the spinach salad with tempura spinach (so unique!) that came with a chicken lime dressing.  The tempura was not overly greasy and paired well with the dressing.  The fried avocado was also very good, creamy on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.  For our entrees, the green curry with chicken and penang curry shrimp were my favorites.  The flavors were excellent, and there was some definite spice to the dishes.  The chicken pad thai and pad Z-U were standard.    The restaurant itself is very pretty inside, with low-lighting for a more romantic atmosphere.  Definitely give this place a try for a more upscale Thai restaurant!",

The food was absolutely delicious. Very well presented, cooked perfectly and authentic, dynamic, balanced flavors.  The venue is well stocked with wines and very ambient and cosy. A great location for romantic dates, but also popular for larger parties. The waitresses were very attentive and made sure we were happy with everything. This restaurant is a surprising and impressive hidden gem in Summerlin! We can't wait to eat here again and will be taking our visiting families here soon also.",

We split an array of seafood-based tapas, as well as the tempura-style spinach, with white wines of our respective choosing. Their vino selection was so pleasing to the palate, and the bartender, an interactive treat of a host.  Left so satisfied, so full and so relaxed that I'm thinking about it a whole week later!",

Each plate is a work of art served in a progressive style of unique combination of food to tantalize the taste buds.  I shared several delicious plates, tender Lamb Chops, a tasty and colorful Salmon-Eggplant with Avocado dish, a crunchy and clever Spinach Salad, and a tapas Golden Pouch that looked like a wrapped gift.

When I wrote the review last year I was so upset about the service I really wanted to give the review a 1 star, but because of the food gave it 3 Stars.  Since September 2016 I have been back to Nittaya's six times and all six times the Staff has been really good, no GREAT!.  First they seem to remember us now.  Second, the indifference we used to experience when we walked in is gone.  Third, the Waitresses and Waiters seem to really care about providing good service along with the exceptional food.  The staff has improved remarkably and they truly seem to care about what they are doing and making sure their customers are completely satisfied.  This is a great restaurant and the staff have become professionals in their craft.  I highly recommend Nittaya's and want to thank everyone from the Bartender to the Waitresses, to the Waiters and most of all to Nittaya for running one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.",

When we told the staff about our experience they started arguing. It's only when I said fine, we can't eat this just get the check and I'll leave did the staff agree to \"add some coconut milk\" to make it palatable. Not a fun place to be on a romantic night.

We went afternoonish so it wasn't busy at all, two other couples, so it was very quiet. Service we pretty quick with seating us and taking our orders, but again it was a quiet afternoon.  We ordered 3 tapas dishes and 2 main dishes and it was way more than we had expected for just the two of us, but the more the merrier right?! We started with the shrimp jalepeno poppers, crispy pork, and the stuffed chicken wings.  For our entree we ordered the home style shrimp pad Thai and the drunken noodles. I love when Thai dishes have a good kick to it, but was a little disappointed when I didn't get just that. The shrimp jalepeno poppers had maybe the littlest kick to them. I also ordered my drunken noodles with spice and was more overwhelmed with the amount of basil in it. To be fair the menu description clearly lists the main ingredients as egg, chicken, and BASIL. All in all, I really did like the restaurant and the food as a whole and would definitely come back! Maybe just ask for a bit more spice next time :)",

The service was amazing and the food was even better!  I asked the server, James, to just \"feed me\" whatever he recommends. James brought me a tapas plate of deep fried pork belly with a sweet chili sauce for a starter. The pork belly was cooked just right and the sauce was spicy hot but I couldn't get enough of it. For my entree I was served curry steak with avocado. The curry sauce was fantastic!  I refrained from licking my plate but I managed to clean the plate using the steak, eggplant, and rice.  Great recommendations James!  I can't wait to visit again. Yummy!",

Anyways, this place got good reviews (That's why I picked this place) so, I had a high expectation of customer service & quality of food. It turned out that the food wasn't as expected. I was surprised Tom Yum wasn't listed on the menu. I asked the server who told me it was called \"Lemon Grass soup\" in the appetizer section.  Anyhow, the server could have been more pleasant. He looked like he didn't want to work there.  The Seafood Madness I ordered was way too salty. I didn't feel it was worth the price. Surprisingly, they brought a (small) bowl of rice for me & my friend to share. I would have preferred to have my own bowl of rice instead.  Not sure if I'd return......",

    "text": "Looking it up I thought it would be a lower-end Asian restaurant but Nittaya took me by surprise at how fancy they were.  The water they serve was infused with Strawberry and another fruit (can't remember). I could taste it a little in the first sip, but ultimately it's just iced water. Still, it was refreshing   Half off bottles of wine on Thursday evenings; if I wasn't leaving the city that night I would've taken them up on it!  All the menu items sounded really good and authentic. Prices are slightly higher than normal but their lunch specials are really good deals (salad, a potsticker, and your entree for only $11). After eating their lunch, I want to say their prices are justified. I guess I'll have to come back again to find out.  Service was also very good, water was refilled consistently and staff was very friendly.  I got the drunken noodles which came out with a small flower, cute. Flavor was solid, and meat was great. The chicken was minced into small bits, it was juicy and full of flavor; I almost thought it was pork! My only gripe is their spiciness is toned way down. I wanted it to be super spicy like many Thai dishes are so I bumped up the spiciness level to 4 (normally one). Unfortunately it was only a ~2 in terms of heat in my opinion. Besides that, this place was a terrific choice for a nice lunch.",

Nittaya's is definitely an elevated and more stylistic type of Thai: seriously tasty and satisfying dishes with a modern tapas flare. Deep and unique flavors in every dish and sauce. Even if you are the type that only gets a common dish like pad thai (like I used to...), you will love it, but I recommend branching out if you come here. The quality and taste equal that of the presentation, which you can tell by the pictures!",

The gentleman ate his steak, and the rest of us, having finished, just sat with him. Then, the server came out with a salad they insisted we ordered, and we had not! We had all finished eating! We had to pay for the salad, they never offered to pack up for us to take and charged us for it! That salad went back to the kitchen and guaranteed, they served to the next person that ordered it!

Unfortunately, I have a one year old and there are no high chairs in the establishment. They clearly don't want families dining there with younger children which I found extremely disappointing. We might give it another shot for just the adults, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. It's also as incredibly small restaurant, on a busy night like we were there, you feel very crowded. Definitely not a romantic atmosphere when you can't enjoy a private conversation.",

When people say deep fried things are amazing they weren't lying! This deep friend spinach is crunchy and filling as far as the sauce that comes along with it it's amazing. I always stick to the drunken noodle which I really recommend. I feel like lunch time sizes vary from dinner sizes and that there may also be the price difference. My boyfriend decide to get the Duck curry I believe and I'm not a huge fan of curry but he said it was delicious, the meat was definitely soft tasted really good.  I didn't try any drinks this time but they have a wide range of wine options and some unique beers, my boyfriend decide to order the Lucky Buddha beer which comes in this really unique glass.    It's a small place yet the service is great. I can honestly say that my glass was always refilled with water and someone always came to check up on us and not in an annoying overbearing way either.  If you're in the Summerlin area definitely check out Nittaya's Secret Kitchen.",

    "text": "Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Thanks Yelp! Just searched and saw amazing reviews and took a leap of faith & found a gem!   An overall great experience from the moment we arrived. First off, this place is a very small restaurant. When we walked in they asked if we made reservations. Of course we didn't because we were first timers. But luckily there was seating outside and Mother Nature was being kind that day.   Someone automatically brought out our Lemon & Cucumber infused water. Fancy? The best water I ever had in a restaurant. Did NOT taste like tap water like most restaurants. I pay attention to the waters! I can't stand when waters taste like unfiltered tap water.   Our waitress, Devynn, was amazing. She gave us great suggestions on what to order.   World Famous Spinach Salad $11- this is a tempura spinach salad with a lime dressing that has ground chicken, onion, cashews, and carrots. This is probably the most unique dish I have ever ate in my life. You can either toss the salad with the dressing OR eat it like chips and salsa. We went with the chips and salsa method so we didn't drown the spinach tempura. It is a MUST GET. They are famous for this! I ordered it and the beau finished it! Lol that's how delicious it was.   Beef Jerky $8- bomb! It actually wasn't too jerky if that makes sense. You were able to chew it and not struggle. It came with a roasted chili sauce that added the right kick.   Shrimp puffs $8- they were like wontons that had shrimp, cream cheese & curry mixed inside. This was probably my least favorite in the meal we ordered BUT still had a good taste to it. I honestly could not taste the shrimp..   Chicken Pad Thai $16- BEST PAD THAI in town, hands down. They have really good spices so we ordered it as a level 2 and oh wow it was amazing. Spicy but not too spicy. It was a large portion which was appreciated. The noodles were cooked perfect. Everything about this dish was perfect.   The presentation of the dishes were beautiful too. They added an Orchid to each plate. How did they know that Orchids were my favorite!?  Highly recommend this place if you are in the summerlin area!",

Also the day they went they had a deal where certain bottles of wine were half off so if you were cheap you could potentially get a bottle of wine for like 8 bucks which is always a nice deal.    The food was very good and there was a lot to choose from.  We had an assortment of  a lot of different foods to choose from because we all ordered something different.  Nothing I had was bad so if you want some good thai food then I highly recommend coming here.",

Everything from decor to wine selection to presentation to flavor is perfection.. It's all about the detail and it shows here. I've been here over a 100 times and have pretty much tried almost everything on the menu. I just keep always going back to 3 of my favorite dishes drunken noodles, chicken basil (add eggplant) and the amazing salmon avocado eggplant green curry .. This restaurant has been around a few years and has since expanded ... I love to support quality local chefs and owners and this place is a True reflection of what Las Vegas offers and a must go to place... I didn't even get to dessert.. I'm always stuffed but I still order dessert .  .. the bread pudding is amazing but I always order the creme brulee.. Nittaya makes an amazing trio with mini lemongrass, green tea and coconut creme brulee amazing ...",

We ended up getting two orders of the tempura avocados. Who knew breading avocados could make them 10x better? It seemed pretty expensive with all the small plates, but if were being honest, I didn't pay the bill, so I didn't really care. This is a perfect third date spot - the one you go on when you're expecting to get laid. Loud enough for pauses to not be awkward, but quiet enough to have nice convos.  They also last-minute put together a bunch of tables to seat all 8 of us in a rather small restaurant, so that hospitality is greatly appreciated. Oodles of pescatarian options, many could be veg if requested. Not that I am, but just so ya know!",

We asked for the shishito peppers as an appetizer, but unfortunately, they were out. So, we got the spinach salad as an appetizer. I still don't know if it was fried or dehydrated spinach, but it was pretty good.   He got the tiger steak which he liked and I got the Pad see yew with shrimp. My Pad see yew was pretty good. I have had better, but it was still pretty good. For dessert, we shared the mango sticky rice. It's a very simple and refreshing dessert. Basically, sliced mangoes and rice. It's very pretty to take a picture of it. I like the way that they put flowers on every dish. Orchids, I believe.  Overall, I like this place. The atmosphere was just perfect.

We stopped in for lunch on a Monday at 2:30pm.  My main dish- Combo Pad Thai off the full menu not the lunch special arrived with egg ( I ordered without/ allergic) so..I sent it back, of course! (The exact thing happened on my last visit to Nittaya's as well). Both times my server didn't notice,  I had to point it out:( When my food finally arrived my husband and daughter were finished with their lunches! I also asked for a 4 out of 5 on the heat ( my dish arrived with no heat). The most upsetting part: place was empty- not busy at all!  No apologies Paid full price  Last visit!",

We walked in and the place is packed, so we chose to sit at the bar. I noted that my friend and I, along with some of the waiters, were the only asians in the house and immediately, i had a bad feeling that the food wouldn't be good lol. My intuition was proven to be right. We ordered the glass noodle salad and the kao soi. The glass noodle salad was so mildly flavor to the point where it's borderline tasteless. Tasted very watered down. This dish has 2 chili signs and there's no heat whatsoever. The kao soi was too salty. Supposedly, the pork shoulder meat that came in the dish was slow cooked, so i was expecting tender and juicy meat, but nope, it was dry and stale. To top it off, both dishes were quite overpriced. I don't mind paying for more if the tastes match the prices. The glass noodle was $15 here, whereas other thai places charge around $10. The kao soi was $19. The only thing that was right about our dinner was my beer lol so yeah, never again will I be back to this place. Go to chuchote, weera, table thai, arawan, i am thai, pin kaow, anywhere but this place...",

We got the fried spinach thingy, calamari, emerald fried rice, and pad see ew. BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE. I know, girls can throw it down.   The deep fried spinach thing as interesting but delicious. It's literally deep fried spinach. They deep fry each leaf. EACH LEAF. How long does that take? Sheesh. Anyways anything deep fried is delicious so this is an A+ in my book. Would I eat it every day? Probably not, my family has a history or heart disease and diabetes. Would I get it maybe 1x every 2 months? Hell yes.   Calamari also deep fried. So can't go wrong. Pad see ew, is the same as every other Thai place. Can't go wrong ordering this either. Out of everything, I probably wouldn't order the emerald fried rice again. I mean it was good, but it just kinda seemed like green curry with rice but without the saucy part. Does that make sense? Like why would I order this when I can just order the green curry, is what I'm saying.   Anyhow, other than the waiters constantly trying to take our food away, it was a delight like always!",

She then continued, \"yea that's that so we can't do anything about it.\"  So I asked what if I reserved for 2 tables of 6 & 1 table for 8 people. I was told they'd ask the manager to see if they can accommodate that.  We called twice to see what their response was. No response to this day.  And we haven't received a call back to deny or confirm our request.   This just leaves a bad taste for us. Poor customer service from staff & management. A call back would have been appreciated",

Only issue I had was the back room was a little chilly since they have the portable fans but other than that great place.",

We walked in and there wasn't anyone to greet us, though we entered during an off hour.  There was one table that had guests waiting for their food.    We had the crab fried rice, chunks of crab meat all over, not salty at all and full of flavor.  It wasn't dry either which was a bonus.  The pad thai was not the variety with ketchup or very little ketchup so it was very welcomed.  I don't tend to like ones that are on the sweeter end, I prefer this one which is browner on for the noodles.  Very enjoyable.  Asked for water, it's infused so bonus!",

Bbq Thai wings $9 just 6 half wings no taste very plain, $5 for herbal tea, nothing special just tea. Crispy pork belly was breaded & over cooked (deep fried). Pork Belly should be crispy with its own pork skin, not breaded. The Spinach salad is breaded deep fried Spinach  (like eating spinach potato chips) not healthy as you might think being Spinach but was good. & finally muey-Thai fried rice was very sweet but maybe it's suppose to be?  Portions not big , prices big, food so so. Sorry 1st time their & will not go back. Don't understand the great reviews I read about this restaurant?  Love good Thai food, this isn't close. I forgot the beef jerky which was good but not enough for me to return. Can any one recommend a really good Thai restaurant? Pin Kaow is great, any others as I'm searching?",

My husband has been trying to take me to Nittaya's for over a year now, we finally made it there last weekend and all I could think of was the many dinners I've missed out on and how I'm going to make it up. We started with the Chicken dumpling/puffs ?  I forget the menu name, it was reminiscent of basil chicken stuffed in pastry dough. Volcano Shrimp and the Spinach Salad. The Spinach lives up to the hype people don't mess up your opportunity to order this delicious item. For our entrees we had the Pad Thai and the seafood coconut curry. I'm about to say something crazy but this was the best Pad Thai I have ever had ! Hands down it's amazing. The seafood coconut curry has an egg cracked inside of it which changes the texture from a smooth curry to one with a little chew. I thought it was delicious but we agreed we would probably order something different next time. Since I have a year of catching up to do next time may come sooner than my husband realizes :)",

We ordered our drinks and placed an order for 4 small tapas. We waited, waited...watched people come after us, order, eat and leave and we still had NOTHING. Our waiter said our ticket was lost in the kitchen so it will be right out?? 48 minutes after placing our appetizer order we finally had something to nibble on. By this time the entire patio was empty and the staff began to clear the table cloths, etc. Not once did someone from management even stop by the table. We had to wait again to place an order for dinner. We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai with a level of 3 of 5. It came out Zero of 5. Absolutely no spice at all. If we had a spice tray we could have tried to add some flavor.  After 2.5 hours it was a long process. The food should have been much better based on all the reviews.    We will give this one more shot but they will need to seriously step it up. The food (will post pictures of each): Phuket Poppers: Jalepenos,  stuffed with cheese, breaded and cut in half. It has 6 but size pieces which equals 2.5 jalepenos for $9, 5 spice Ribs: ribs were spiced nice but were tough and not much meat at all. Presentation was nice. Would have preferred tender meat and more meat than bone. Larb Chicken Cups: romain lettuce leaves with chicken larb on top. Needed more lime, a few more slivers of red onion and the spice tray. Volcano Shrimp: bowl of butterflied shrimp, breaded in a bowl with sliced jalapeno slices that are presented on fire. Presentation was nice but only 4 shrimp and again not a lot of flavor. Yum baked shrimp ordered spice level 3. 5 shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce in a sauce. Forget the sauce. This came with the most flavor of any dish. Pad Thai shrimp: OMG this was just a bowl of super slimy noodles, NO and I mean NO flavor and 5 shrimp, few bean sprouts and tablespoon of crushed peanuts on the side. Two of us took two bites and told the third person they could have it.   All three of us were just shocked and out evening. Again not once did the manager stop by our table. We weren't sure if our nice waiter had screwed up with our ticket or if management is just poor. But either way. The food we ordered should have been better all around. When we received our bill we would have thought they would have at least comped our Thai iced tea or something but Nothing at all.  We will try again and update pictures and review. Hoping for the best.",

We bring a different group of friends or family with us most of the time. First off let me just say that this place is about a 25 minute drive from our house but definitely worth the drive. It is a small intimate restaurant with servers that are very knowledgeable about the food menu as well as the wines that they offer. Thursdays it is 1/2 off bottles of wine all day and night, so plan on taking a Lyft to and from (we do)! Servers Devyn, Poom, and Josh are extremely friendly and always remember our favorite wines and dishes. The five spiced bbq ribs, seared ahi tuna, the green apple salad with soft shell crab, the crab rolls, the bacon wrapped shrimp with pineapple-chili sauce, volcano shrimp, and crispy pork belly are great tapas/small plates. If you like soups and salads try the Thai bouillabaisse and the Thai beef salad but with the salad ask for some cashew-lime dressing to add to it YUM! As for the entrees, you can not go wrong. Every dish is so flavorful and unique. Nittaya really put her heart and soul into her recipes. The garlic-basil lamb chops, the duck breast curry, crying tiger ribeye, and emerald fried rice are amazing. Save room for dessert too which they call \"happy endings\"! The Thai donuts with coconut rum caramel sauce and the Family style coconut ice cream with coconut sticky rice and served in a whole young coconut are two must haves. If you like a good sweet riesling with your spicy food, I recommend the Monchhof Mosel Riesling Spatlese.",

    "text": "I have spent a lot of time in Northern and Southern California where there are big Thai communities and the restaurants work very hard to be the best in their food genre. This place is cute and they worked very hard to make it look amazing...which it does. The waitstaff is awesome. They are attentive and they are friendly.  The food is Thai food for people who haven't had real Thai food. Thai food should have layers of flavor all working together.   For example..we ordered the Coconut Soup and the FOB Rice (Fresh off Pineapple Boat). These items were tasty, except the chicken that is being used for this was cooked in such a way that they could use in in both dishes. These means that the chicken has to be cooked with no discernable taste. Although the soup and the Rice were really awesome, when you get to the pieces of chicken, they haven't been able to develop any flavor and they are extremely bland. This takes a potentially awesome dish and kills the awesomeness.  We did order a few appetizers, Curry Puffs, Secret Stickers, and Edamame. The Curry Puffs and  Secret Stickers are interestingly enough cooked in what seems to be a Bisquick-type dough instead of the typical Thai-style dumpling shao-mai wrappers. The Edamame had the layers of flavor and heat that I was looking for.  When I expressed to the waitress that I wished that the food was a little hotter, she did bring me three things to add to my meal. The first one was a dish of pepper flakes, the second was something that may have been sriracha and the last was the sriracha with the pepper flakes in it. Thai sauces should vary, not just be about heat but should be about traditional Thai flavors.  We also ordered 2 entrees, the Crying Tiger Steak and the Kao-Soi (Pork Shoulder). The steak arrived cooked perfectly but cold. (This is why many restaurants will tell you that a plate is hot when they serve your food...a room temperature plate will lower the heat of your meal by 10 degrees or more by the time it gets to your table) and the Kao-Soi in this bath of really tasty but a sloppy mess of slightly overcooked egg noodles. The pork was cooked perfectly. All was tasty.  WIll we go back? No. There are so many places in Vegas that we will only return to the ones that have memorable food...and there are a lot of Thai restaurants to visit.   Secret Garden, thank you for the wonderful memory...but for us, it's .",

The food here is not exactly authentic Thai, but the flavors and the dishes are incredible! The noodles are delicious, but come here for the appetizers/tapas! Tapas are good for sharing, and I've heard their potstickers and wings are delicious!  I ordered the Secret Spinach Salad....which, despite the name, is not at all a healthy dose of spinach. It's crispy fried spinach with an awesome tangy light dressing that is just a tad bit spicy....it's incredible. I also ordered the Crab Meat Fried Rice, which was very tasty and had some good chunks of crabmeat :)   I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  Decor is dark & romantic. Service is solid. Only thing is they don't really like to make substitutions/changes to the menu (ie we asked to remove the fried egg from the bangkok fried rice, but the waitress said no).",

    "text": "Generally, I find the trend of fusion restaurants to be an empty fad.  Most of the time, one restaurant blending two culinary traditions simply fails at both of them, rather than creating something interesting.  So I walked into Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, which offers a fusion of tapas and Thai foods, with a heavy bias.  But I left pleasantly surprised because Nittaya's has mastered the art of juggling -- offering a wonderful selection of Thai and tapas fusion dishes that are often better than what you'd find in Thai or tapas restaurant.    When we were there, we had the fried avocado for an appetizer.  It's the only time I've ever used the terms \"airy\" and \"fried\" to describe the same dish, but it really was an inventive combination with the delightful fried crispy shell surrounding the soft tastiness of a fresh avocado.  If you head over there, I'd put the fried avocado on your \"must have\" list.    We also ordered the spinach salad, which was tasty, but not quite as magical as the fried avocado.  The spinach salad also comes with fried spinach leaves, which are tasteless on their own.  But dip the fried spinach leaves in the sweet cashew sauce provided on the side and it's fairly tasty.  A distant second to that lovely avocado, but creative in its own right.  For the mean course, we stuck with a more traditional Thai and ordered the red curry with chicken.  And kudos to Nittaya's for not dialing back the spice.  The red curry was spicier that I was expecting and super flavorful.  And they treat the ingredients right.  The vegetables?  Cooked and crisp.  The chicken?  Tender.  And they didn't skimp on the vegetables in the curry.  All in all, one of the better Thai places I've eaten in Vegas.  The prices are a little steep, but creativity doesn't come cheap in culinary land.  4.5 stars overall.",

It's small without a lot of tables, but we've never had any problems getting in with large parties . . . even up to 11.  I don't have the menu in front of me, so I may get some of the names wrong, but these dishes are always on our list...chicken satay for the kids...they even love the peanut sauce.  Garlic rice and the pineapple rice.  The coconut soup is awesome and all the other chicken and beef dishes have never disappointed.  Hopefully the Secret Kitchen will always be a secret...",

    "text": "This should be kept a secret so that no one has the terrible food I had.  There are many great Thai places in Las Vegas and there is no need to eat here.    The only plus is that the tiny dining room is cute.  Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.    Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on, really would a ramekin of sauce kill you?  Normally I am used to prawns in yummy egg roll wrappers.   My husband sent back the drunken noddles because it had eggs, which we have never had in any Thai restaurant ever.  He then got a very unremarkable basil chicken which was had so much gristle he had to spit it out.    My crab fried rice either had fake crab or really terrible crab.   The only okay thing was the chicken satay we ordered for the children.  The water was infused with fruit, that wasn't bad.   The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple.  Either figure out some new plating or serve it family style.",

It's another place right in my neighborhood and I'm happy to report that it was a fine dining experience, as in great!  I had the spinach salad, which, as other reviewers have said, is a must:  it's tempura spinach--where else can you get that?  I also ordered the grilled mango shrimp, which is shrimp wrapped in bacon with a mango sauce: I did not share this dish.  My date had the  grilled salmon-avocado curry, which he loved and ate all by himself because I'm allergic to fish, but it gave me a good excuse to hoard my shrimp.  We finished off the meal with the fried bananas with coconut ice cream--wow!  Service was excellent throughout, but it's hard to be neglected in such a small space--I would recommend reservations if you go.  This place shouldn't be a secret because I want it to stay--check it out for yourself soon!",

    "text": "We went there Christmas Eve on the recommendation of friends who love this place. I would recommend reservations, as the room is quite small. One of my companions and I split tapas of beef jerky and egg rolls. The jerky was quite good, but the egg rolls seemed pretty standard. The spinach salad is amazing, and as I live close by, I drop by frequently to pick it up at lunch time to go. The entrees we had were very good... just the right amount of \"bite\" in the items that were supposed to bite.   A couple of downs that kept me from giving it a fifth star. First, the room is *really* dark; so much so that my 17-year old couldn't see the menu, and he can read the Lord's Prayer off the head of a pin. The manager told me they'd had a few comments about this, and may invest in some penlights to help patrons. Since the menu is eclectic, it really helps to be able to read it. The second thing was that two of my companions are vegetarians, a fact of which I made very clear to the waiter when we came in. One of my companions ordered the Tofu Pad Thai, which she said was quite good until she was about a third through it and found that in addition to the tofu, it contained... chicken. Buzz kill. They were very apologetic, but this should *not* happen, ever, and it was exacerbated by the fact that the restaurant lights are so dim that it is sometime hard to discern what you're eating.   Overall, I thought the food great, the service acceptable, but the ambience too dark.  That's just my opinion. I coud be wrong.",

It's tucked away behind all the buildings on the Southeast corner of Lake Mead Blvd. and Rampart Blvd. I had to bring the crew here because I've been telling them about it for a while. They were blown away. They absolutely loved it, it was good to see how much everybody else liked it. I feel like I'm always biased because of how much I like my favorite restaurants but this was different, everyone at the table couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. So I knew it wasn't me being biased. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The restaurant itself is decorated with style and class. It's very clean inside and they pride themselves with running a tight ship. Anyway if you decide to make the trip down to Nittaya's Secret Kitchen just order your favorite Thai dish and buckle up because you're in for a treat..! Ciao",

The waitress was so sweet and helpful! I had no idea what I was doing or what I was ordering and she picked that up quickly and explained things to me/suggested things for me. She rocked!",

    "text": "Wow I'd have to say that this place is a hidden gem! Romantic ambience and authentic Thai food is the theme. I started off with a beautiful white sangria that had a flower in it. Be careful, these are dangerous! They are very sweet and go down very easily. We tried multiple tapas including the golden pouches, fried avocado, and Siamese corn fritters. My favorite of these were the corn fritters. They had a crunchy exterior with a soft stuffing including kernels of corn, pork and spices. The sauce that came with these was delicious! It was sweet and had peanuts floating in it. The golden pouches were also very tasty. I got these to try their curry sauce which was excellent. These pouches were so pretty I didn't even want to eat them! The fried avocado was also very tasty and an interesting concept. At last I tried the chocolate banana beignets. OMG these were divine. They were stuffed with a deep dark chocolate and bananas in the inside. They were then drizzled with chocolate on the outside. They came hot and freshly fried. This place serves a multitude of wines and had two beers on tap.  It did not appear that they serve any type of mixed drinks or hard liquor. This secret place is definitely a restaurant that should not be kept secret!",

Closely-arranged tables and chairs make for close quarters and careful navigation.  Service was friendly, courteous, and helpful with gluten-free and vegan options.  The vegan coconut ice cream is a wonderfully sweet, refreshing treat.  Tofu green curry was tasty with a light coconut broth.  It's a good idea to make dinner reservations.",

Not sure what was in that food that made me so sick. I will never go back there again.",

The place is really small and we had to eat at the bar, no biggie, but it filled up quickly and we were lucky to have gotten seats. Make reservations if you want to try it out!  My fiance seemed to enjoy this place much more than me, and she holds it in a higher regard than P.F. Chang's for sure.   I ordered my meal 5/5 spicy, and extra spicy if he could do it. To me, not spicy at all. My lady took one taste and started coughing and downing water. Sooo...depending on your tolerance level.  I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken instead of shrimp, flavor was pretty good. I also got the spicy chicken fried rice. Also tasted pretty good. But like I said, it was just P.F. Chang's quality, nothing special.   Definitely lost a star for being as expensive as it was given the food quality, but it'd be a solid 4 if the food came up a bit or the price went down.",

    "text": "I came here a few months ago for a pick up order in the evening. The lad who took my order was nice and very helpful, as I was trying to make wise food choices for being a Nat noob. Upon his recommendations and my own inclinations, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with mango sauce, red curry, and pad Thai (had to, it's my guiding light for Thai food judgement). Total: $43.24. Bam.  The space is cozy and intimate, and you can tell it's a local's spot. When I walked in at precisely 9.54 pm to pick up my order, there were 3 people seated away from each other at the bar area, chatting away. Very cool. It kind of reminded me of DW Bistro.  On to the fooood.  Bacon shrimp was not as awesome as I thought it would be. I couldn't taste the shrimp, but I certainly got the texture of chewy shelled animal. The bacon was good because bacon is always good. Mango sauce? Good not great, not particularly sweet. I was expecting a great flavor, something like a bacon wrapped date gives you. But this one was lacking in the flavor and texture department.  Pad Thai was very yummy. Great flavors, just enough heat, and plenty of chicken and egg to beef it up. I also appreciate that it didn't have that weird red dye color from the sauces most places use. Yay for quality ingredients!  The curry was overwhelmingly spicy. It overpowered the delicious coconut and spices underneath, of which I caught glimpses. It had a nice mix of bamboo shoots and red bell peppers. The jasmine rice it came with smelled divine and tasted great with the curry. No weird hard bits. They know how to make rice.  I would certainly go back.",

    "text": "So, we drove from my house(east-side) to Nittaya's to take pictures since my BF is building their new website.  After about an hour there, we were starving so decided to stay and try out the food. I'm going to start by saying that I have had Thai food plenty of times in SF but will admit that I am not an expert, although, I will say that Thai and Vietnamese share a lot of the same flavors and herbs.  Let's start with the atmosphere, it's very quaint and has a very mellow vibe.  White table cloths and lit candles- lovely place for locals to have a \"date night\" away from the kids.  The menu has Thai Tapas- smaller plates/appetizers that range from $4-$8 a plate as well as a good selection of entrees as well as a beer/wine/sake bar.  Wish I didn't have to work the next day otherwise I would've had a nice sake with dinner.  Okay- so we ordered a few different entrees/tapas.  Here's the low down: Chicken Satay- nice and moist, slight char from grilling (which I like) and peanut sauce  Lemongrass soup-reminds me of hot and sour soup(which I love) but slightly salty. Normally I would eat it with white rice to balance out the saltiness, still still good nonetheless with great flavor  Spinach salad- the BOMB!! hello, not like a typical spinach salad!! The leaves are individually dipped in a tempura-like batter so is very light and comes with a ground chicken larb. It was SOO good! This dish alone would bring me back all the way to the other side of town for!  Green Curry with chicken-again, since I am not an Thai food expert, it was good but a little on the sweet side for me.  I usually have curry Indian style so am not used to the slightly sweet coconut flavor but the vegetables were perfectly cooked.  Combo Pad Thai-again, slightly sweet but nothing a few lime wedges and some sambal can't cure.   We finished with the coconut sticky rice and sweet mango.  Loved the coconut sticky rice but wish it was a little more moist. Mango was perfect, sweet and ripe.  Overall, A+ for me, will definitely be back to try the other dishes on the menu!!",
