I've came here for lunch and dinner at different times and both times I didn't have to wait to be seated. The staff is friendly and definitely acknowledges the presence of their customers. Not many places do that nowadays.  The place is a bit small but it still feels very spacious. They have tables, booths, and a bar. The place also looks clean.  Their menu is pretty simple to follow if you haven't had Japanese curry before, they offer a lot of pictures of each dish. You choose the level of spiciness on your curry.  I've has the tofu katsu, pork katsu, and chicken katsu here. My favorite out of the 3 is the tofu katsu!. The curry is very flavorful. It's savory and packs a lot of heat! You can also get a non spicy curry.  Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Zen Curry is one of my favorite places to go if I'm feeling like treating myself to a hearty meal. It averages out to about $10-$14 a plate for a person depending on what they customize your plate with. What I really like about the menu is customizing the spicy levels of your meal, rating from 1 (mild) to 10 (burning your butthole.)   If it is your first time trying Japanese curry, you can never go wrong with the chicken katsu curry plate. But if you're feeling adventurous, I suggest you try my plate: scrambled eggs with spinach, tomato, cheese and sausage curry with 16 grains rice--best hangover cure ever!   Only downside, parking lot is ALWAYS full. :( but don't let that stop you from getting the best Japanese curry you'll get in Vegas!",

    "text": "This is really such a shame, since this place came so close to a 5 star curry perfection, marred from numerous small missteps, missing lunch menu items, and minor details.  First of all, the chicken katsu is the dish to get, hands down. I tried both pork and chicken, and the chicken was breaded and fried to such a perfection that I almost had misty eyes. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and fried with such an amazing crispy layer without requiring extra calories just to bite through the protein. The pork, unfortunately, did not get the memo, as the meat was much tougher and less flavored than its other white meat cousin. Since this was my first and possibly the last visit, I had tried a series of appetizers. However, the takoyaki was gone and we showed up literally 15 minutes after the store opened. The fried oyster exceeded my expectation as it was juicy and marinating in its own sauces when I bit through the crispy exterior. The tofu salad was good (although I've never been a fan of iceberg lettuce) and we also tried the edamame (overly salted and many were shriveled), the chicken skewers (protein on a stick, forgettable). As for the main course, my friend and I got he brown rice with curry and the respective meats. I tried a spicy level 8 and it was sizzling, but not cathostrophic. The curry, in my opinion was just a little bit too salty for my taste, but made more bearable when eaten with the curry. Oh yeah, we also ordered the peach jelly champagne, which was an interesting experience, but not sure if it was worth $7.5.  Overall, this is definitely a popular spot amongst the locals, as the place filled up pretty quickly by 12:30pm, so I recommend coming early and preparing your dining experiences.  Food: 4 stars Price: 3-4 stars Service: 3 stars Ambiance: 3 stars",

    "text": "Richard Pro here with another review.  I was skeptical of all the positive reviews--after all, curry is curry, and I've had my fair share of it. However, I'm pleased to say this place really hits the spot. Small, cramped, cozy, and warm, Japanese Curry Zen instantly impresses with soft sticky rice, a generous portion of addicting curry sauce, and a huge selection of meats.  First off, the curry is spicy! Level 3 was already more than I could handle, and it goes up to level 10. I tried pork katsu, pork tenderloin, grilled chicken, and kurobata sausage.   The pork katsu and tenderloin taste the same yet one costs more than the other. So if I were you, I'd choose the cheaper one. You really can't tell the difference once they cut it up and fry it.   The grilled chicken was disappointing. Dry and unmarinated. Yes, you're supposed to lather it with sauce but it doesn't change the fact that it comes dry and unmarinated.  The kurobata sausage impressed me the most. Perhaps because I've never had it before, but I was honestly expecting some kind of hot dog and ended up being pleasantly surprised. It has a nice flavor to it.  Portion size is quite generous and service is great.",

As other Yelpers have mentioned it is a cute little restaurant with less than 4 tables in addition to their solo diner's bar.. They have an open kitchen so you can see the chef making your food.   I had the chicken katsu curry with brown rice, corn and cheese. The portion size was good.. The curry didn't have any crazy strong tastes but the flavor was all there! I love the little add ons.. especially the pickled onions.. The waitress was very nice and kept our water glasses full. The chef even touched tables and made sure everything was delicious. Amazing service from such a little place.. Love it! The bill for 2 came up to a little over $20..! cheap & tasty = perfect!   This will definitely be my go to spot when I'm craving curry although like Monta, I would probably stay away during peak times.   RANDOM: are you the type of curry eater who eats it very clean or do you like to mix everything around on your plate and get a little messy? haha  TIP: don't forget to look at the Specials board.. I definitely want to go back to try the tofu katsu and curry udon ;]]]",

The chicken is nicely breaded and fried fresh and slightly crispy. The curry tastes just like the authentic Japanese curry we've had several times in Japan. Probably because it is! The shumai was also a tasty appetizer. The mustard flavor with the shoyu is a nice combination with the pork. Nice, hot, spicy, and just all-around good food! We will be back.",

I've been a handful of times and the curry is always consistent and has great flavor.  In addition, I like/enjoy: -You basically build y our own curry plate. You can either start with a plain plate and add on items, or just order one of their set plates. -You can change the spicy level, but you pay for anything above spice level 5 -They have Curry Udon now!!!   -Chicken Katsu is a thick cut,  not dry and fried well. -Jasmine Tea is good -Spinach Curry is a good way to get the greens in without taking away from the curry.   I would definitely come back, and grab take out from time to time.",

Maybe all at the same time! The servers will work hard for you regardless of how busy it will get. Nice and polite wait staff!   The food overall is amazing.

Went with spice level 10, which had decent kick, but I also added some of what was in the shaker on the table, pretty sure it was cayenne. There's a sweet and salty Japanese sauce as well. Throw in some gyoza, which were as good as any I've had anywhere, and takoyaki (fried octopus balls, and it was a great meal for a great price.",

I ordered a pork cutlet with brown rice, corn and croquette - and no, I didn't have to use any of the condiments.  It tasted great on its own and it was filling.  My bro-in-law got the chicken cutlet with white rice, cheese and corn which he annihilated in a few minutes!  The curry was spicier than what I'm used to (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food) but I didn't mind.  On the back of the menu is a list of spices they use for their curry and what health benefits you could get from each spice which I thought was pretty interesting.  I thought my Chinese grandmother was just making stuff up when I was little!  Our server, Jason, was great and easy on the eyes.  The chef came out of the kitchen to personally thank us for coming.

Because of their outstanding service, it's hard not to come back.   As far as the food goes, the curry is thick and full of flavor. There are many additional toppings to add and specials are always changing, so you won't get bored! Food always comes out hot and fast.  Also, Curry Zen is open late, so it's a great place to hit up after a late shift or an evening class.   I go at least once a week and so should you!",

I think they've recently expanded their menu a bit but I have always been thoroughly impressed with their Japanese curry. The curry itself is standard for their dishes. You pick your meat or veggie option, pick your level of spice and they add rice and voila...you have an awesome dish. They also have a list of add-ons that you would typical see at other places like ramen spots.  Facilities: They've recently expanded (that's a good sign). And now they're double the size that they were when they opened. There might be a wait....but given how fast they get their food ready...wait times shouldn't be a problem. but as a guest, please keep to the same manners as you would with Monta next door...don't hand around...get in...eat your food...and dip.   Staff: This is more of a food-service spot so, by design, the staff won't chat it up too much. But they are friendly, quick with service and check back frequently.   Now I am getting hungry.",

The stupid waiter named Yuta went to our table and gave us our bill.   We paid right away and he asked us if we need anything else - we said no thats all but he still kept on looking at us.  We were still talking while waiting for my husband who went to the restroom and the stupid waiter came back again at our table saying since we didnt need anything if we can leave  coz theres a big party waiting outside.  Really?  Who cares if there's a big parttly outside?   Is it right to ask customers to leave right away after they ate and they got the money already?  That was freakin rude and very disrespectful.   I asked to speak with the owber and he said the waiter did the right thing coz they do have a small place.  And that gave them the right to disrespect customers by asking to leave after eating?   Stupid and uneducated people!!!!!   Will never go.back there again.  I'll give my business elsewhere who's deserving and have  intelligent owners and workers.  Never will I go to this stupid place again!!!",

I love spicy food so it's great that they make your curry as spicy as you want it. When you choose a spicy level 6 it's like a 10.

They custom created one of the appetizer specials (deep fried oysters) as a curry for me [Chef behind the counter heard me ordering, and said \"no problem, we can do that\"].   It is so delicious!  Service was lightning fast, foods were served in under 5 minutes.  Seems a little small for how busy it is, feels crowded, they could have easily filled 3 or 4 more tables if they expanded into bigger space.  The serving sizes were just right, I cleared my plate, but wasn't hungry afterwards.  I really like that they offer a wide range of curry spiciness, on a scale of like 1 to 10 I believe. Perfectly accommodating everyone in a family or a group. They also have genuine vegetarian options, again accommodating everyone in the family.  This is my first time at a fusion Japanese curry restaurant. I will definitely be bringing my family here.",

You can actually experience the burst of unique flavors melting in your mouth. Seriously! :) If you are do not mind fried food (although it's not dripping oil), you can try one of katsu items. Tofu katsu is average and chicken katsu is not very different from chicken wings at KFC. I usually pair the entree with a side of tasty Tofu salad. Thai Ice tea is housemade and is refreshing! I tried Oolong tea for a change last time, but wasn't too happy with my choice, as it was bottled and unsweetened. I guess I will stick with my Thai tea from next time.",

    "text": "I have a favorite curry house back in Honolulu called CoCo Curry House, which has imho really great curry and is modeled just like this place with the base curry dish and add on selections. I think it has the exact same feel but slightly different curry taste. The curry here has more of an earthy taste and more powdery texture, which i kinda like, not more just different. the curry here is definitely alot more spicy even at its mildest. I cant take too much heat, as I sweat profusely. I could enjoy the spice at home fine but id need a towel at the restaurant. So if you like spicy this place is probably going to satisfy you. I ate the Japanese Meatloaf with Chicken Katsu and they were both very tasty. I particularly liked the Japanese Meatloaf which was almost a hamburger patty save the spice mixture in it. It was very soft inside with that great flat top crisp on the outside. The servers were very fast and polite. They have really good rice, something i always look for in a curry house. Definitely going back to check out the other things on the menu.",

For health benefits she recommended the 16 grain rice with the spinach curry mixed with the vegetable curry.  It was soul warming, hearty, and yummy.   Hubby got the chicken katsu curry and liked it a lot.   This place is tiny and super popular. Perfect for small groups, but plan ahead. At 4:30 PM on a Saturday we waited about 20 min for a table for two.",

It compliments well with the fried chicken. At first glance it may not look super appetizing but it is! And it's not oily. I add cheese and raisins for extra flavor~ -Katsu spiciness is from 1-10. I usually have mine at 3, because 4 and up is too spicy! haha -Takoyaki ($4.50): This is a deep fried ball filled with octopus. Super delicious!  CONS: -I've been going to Curry Zen for a couple years now, and very recently they started to make their portions smaller :(  -Also you have to ask for raisins and all the extra-free toppings.",

It is also one of those restaurants that you would probably want to go to every day if only it was right by your house.  I always go for the Katsu curry and it does come on a large plate. It is definitely more than filling and sometimes kills me inside because there is more rice than I can handle.  The service is constantly good and I am so lucky that this restaurant is in the same plaza as Kung Fu Tea. I mean I feel like I am always in a win win situation whenever I do eat here because of all these other places in the same plaza!  This restaurant beats Tokyo Kitchen any day.",

There was a little wait for curry Zen, as there was one fairly large party ahead of us. It wouldn't have been too bad but we had to wait outside in the cold . My mom tried it before and was saying how good it was so we decided to just take our chances at Curry Zen and it was soooo good. We a loved our food. I got a spice level 2 with the pork Katsu curry and it was plenty of spice for me. I could see the portion sizes being kind of small for some but it filled me up. I definitely plan on going back.",

There's a large quantity of restaurants in the area and we had to search out a spot. Once inside, it took maybe five minutes for a table to open up, which was better than expected. It's a smaller restaurant so I could see them being pretty busy at times.   The food was great. I got the curry udon and tried some of my friends katsudon. The curry udon had a great flavor. I would definitely get that again but I'd probably get a side of rice to go with it to mix up the flavors and textures a little next time. The Katsudon was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and had this kind of sweet but not normal sweet taste to it that I loved. Also something I would definitely get again.  I wanted to try some of the appetizers as well, but figured the portions would be a good size. One appetizer to 3-4 people would probably make more sense unless you are local or are in a hotel where you can take leftovers with you.",

I have eaten here, with my wife several times and overall have been impressed with the food and service. However, be warned it is a popular establishment so wait times can be excessive. Also, the restaurant has a great deal on beer, it is only $5 for a large bottle of Kirin and nicely takes the edge off the spiciness. The menu is decent with solid appetizer selections and is a great spot to go for lunch. Be forewarned the parking can be tight because there are several popular dining establishments in the small plaza. If you find yourself on the west side of town, on the edge of Chinatown and you are looking for a great spot to grab a meal stop in and try curry zen.",

They do have a fast turnover rate at this place, and table free up rather quick for the times we visited them.  First time I was there was in a hurry, the curry was rather plain here, and their explanation was because their curry is so good that they do not need anything else beside the sauce... a bit too proud?  The flavor was just ok from all the curry I had eaten around the world.  Another time I avoid the curry, and got Katsudon instead, and it was actually much better choice, and they made the right way too.  Other starters we tried were Deep Fried Shumai and Takoyaki.  Shumai was just \"meh\", a bit too dried, and bland.  The takoyaki was just ok as well, a bit too floury on the inside.  I guess my expectation was a bit high being in Vegas and all, but Curry Zen would not be a first choice for me if I had a craving for Japanese cooked dish.  The staffs seemed like they have an attitude problem too.",

Japanese curry with Chicken Katsu is one of my all-time favorite dishes. This one was a little disappointing. I had the Chicken Katsu Curry w/ Brown Rice ($8.95). I was really pleased that brown rice was an option with no additional cost. The katsu was decent. The curry itself is what I wasn't really feeling.  The consistency and everything else about this dish was great, but the flavor wasn't what I like (or expect) in Japanese curry. It wasn't bad, but not what I want.  Also, I was really peeved that Fukujinzuke or any type of Japanese pickled vegetables were NOT set on the table or offered with your meal. I had to ask two servers because the first one seemed to have forgotten and we waited for some time. When we finally received it, they had only brought one dish for two of us. Although rather stingy, I thought one was standard for the table until I saw the party across from us had THREE things of pickled vegetables (and two types) for three people. Totally lame. What's Japanese curry without Fukujinzuke?!  Everything about this place made me feel like I wasn't in a Japanese curry house. Besides the menu. The menu looks great and the options are fun and vast. The curry flavor, missing or shortage of wonderful pickled vegetables, and lackluster service made me leave feeling sad and disappointed.",

They said that 5 is pretty spicy so keep that in mind.   The dish was really good, and because i had a sore throat i wasn't able to finish it.  The brown rice actually went pretty good with the curry and they didn't charge us extra for the brown rice.   It's a great place to come on a cold day.  The service was great and the place was clean.

The servers are unbelievably courteous, efficient, and always have a smile on their face. Every customer is greeted with an enthusiastic \"Welcome!\" and is seated almost immediately. The servers are also quick to let customers know if the wait time for a specific dish is projected to be longer than usual, so there are never any unpleasant surprises regarding that.   Although the menu isn't extensive, people who'd rather not have curry do have some other options, such as Takoyaki, Gyoza, and rice bowls, which are all pretty good. The food is prepared fast and timed just right, so orders for the same table come out at around the same time. It's definitely a perk when I go out with friends to eat and talk.  The portions are big considering the low price - just perfect for hungry broke college students. There is not all that much meat on the Beef Curry, but I usually get the Grilled Chicken Curry, which has a good meat-to-rice ratio and tastes fabulous. I come here at least once every month, and I have never had a bad experience. A day that involves Curry Zen is always a good day.",

Everything on the menu is Japanese curry, coming with a choice of pork, chicken, vegetable, and whole bunch of other selections. The spicy scale is from 1-10, but it doesn't come that spicy, I'd say the 7 is their 'medium'. The chicken katsu curry is on point, that is the one I always get and it's a good dish for first-timers to try. The service is fast and friendly, it's a small establishment so it's almost always crowded, expect a wait.",

Anyway, my favorite curry spot when we were in Tokyo was CoCo Curry.  It's a chain there, but the curry is SO good.  The Tonkatsu is SO good - juicy, crispy.  Everything SO good.  So when I got home to Vegas, I was on the hunt for comparable curry.  After trying curry at maybe 2 or 3 spots, I decided to check out Zen Curry.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly disappointed.  The curry didn't have the UMPH I remembered from Japan and the tonkatsu wasn't nearly the same.  HOWEVER, it is good!  Don't get me wrong, its probably the best Japanese curry that Vegas has to offer.  The curry had good flavor and a really nice smooth texture.  The service was aiight... the prices were decent.  I would recommend this place!  My fav thing that we tried was the takoyaki... YUM!  Crispy, creamy inside, bursting with flavor.  Try it.",

There was also a waiting list, but it was much more manageable and they seated us under 15 or so minutes. All of us got curry udon as it was highly recommended on their blackboard. It came out piping hot, and we could immediately tell the focus was on the curry broth, which was thick and full of flavor. The noodle also had the perfect texture and was able to absorb the aromas of the broth. The toppings of scallion and meat pieces were rather minimal, but that was understandable as the curry itself was already rich enough. While the bowl looked small, it actually had more depth than it appeared, and the broth helped fill us up on a surprisingly small budget.",

    "text": "I enjoy the Japanese curry here - I really do. There's a lot of homemade and wholesome qualities about the place and food, and it doesn't taste like the curry is oversaturated with monosodium glutamate, which is great! In fact, the curry is quite smooth - not as thick of a consistency as I am used to, but also does not have chunks of anything included. The rice is very fluffy and sticky. Their main downfall is that portion sizes are unimpressive - I can find a similar sized katsu curry dish in an Asian supermarket food court for a few dollars cheaper. Eating a full dish did satisfy me, however, but I got hungry a few hours later, and it seems like you need to include add-ons or appetizers to really complete the meal. Looking through the pricing, I did not find any add-ons or appetizers worth it.  I've tried the chicken katsu and pork katsu - chicken seemed to taste just a little better in some way - maybe it was the more varied texture and grooves of the breading. I've tried having the cheese for a topping, and it was pretty cool - it did partially melt and provided melty goodness, but it also would have more or less tasted the same without. I've tasted the curry with no spice added, and with a spice level of 4 (\"blaZEN\" levels range from 1-10 and cost between 20 to 45 cents extra). Level 4 adds a good kick to it, but nothing really spicy on the tongue.  I also did not like that you have to ask for fukujinzuke for it to be included. The menu pictures show them included, and I wouldn't have even known that they had to be requested, had I not overheard someone. I must be spoiled from curry places around my area and from overseas.",

Immediately as we walk in we notice how small the dinning area is, probably only capable of seating 15 dinners or less. I swear I think the it was the size of my bedroom, haha! However, there were only a few other patrons since it was a Monday night. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the croquet with corn while my friend had the chicken katsu, corn with cheese. We both enjoyed our meals very much so and particularly liked that there was a slight hint of spice in the curry. The croquet was pretty standard so I couldn't complain there. The prices are pretty cheap too, most menu meals were under $10. So if you are on a budget I definitely recommend this place. I liked my first visit so much I had been craving this place days after so I came back a week later with a different friend. We came in on a Sunday night and since this place is so small, it was packed! There was a \"waiting list,\" but I guess those people didn't like standing outside so I think they just left. Initially she was kind of iffy about trying another Curry place since she's had the legit ones in Hawaii and she recently tried Kaba Curry's original location on Charleston and wasn't a fan. I glad she was pleasantly surprised! We had both ordered the chicken katsu with corn. Yum I must say and I also like the fact you can order brown rice which makes it feel a bit healthier. A major downer is that everything is FRIED, except the beef curry stew. The menu is definitely minimal and they should consider expanding and adding options like omelet or loco moco.",

We arrived in the evening when they were pretty busy but there were two empty seats at the counter. The waiter who sat us asked US if anyone was before us in line for a table- um, how should we know? There were two guys hanging around outside but they could have been waiting for take-out or something else, and it's not my job to keep track of your customers for you. Also I just got here?  So anyway, he sat us and took our drink order... and then suddenly remembered that there WERE other customers in line for a table and made us get up and leave. I was completely appalled at how unprofessional and absurd this behavior was. We were seated and had our order taken! He kind of acted like we did this on purpose, too, like we were trying to sneak ahead of the other customers. It was just gross.  Even if I still lived in the area, I would never eat at Curry Zen again. One bonus star for being yummy and introducing me to Japanese curry, which I've since enjoyed at several other restaurants.",

    "text": "I've been going to Curry Zen so much for over a year now. They really have progressed a lot in the past year.   Before, their restaurant was very small but ever since they expanded, it has been very spacious and there is always a seat for you right away unless you are a very large party.  Their service is still amazing as always and nothing says the best customer service than the owner coming out to check on his own customers and asking how everything is. The servers themselves are always very kind and attentive.  They recently also expanded their menu and have more appetizers and desserts now. They also got new toppings to go with their curry. For all you spicy lovers out there, there is a higher level than spicy 10. Me and my friends all tried spicy 100 and it is the spiciest curry you will ever taste. It costs $5 more for spicy 100, however, if you cannot handle it and am unable to finish your food, the owner is nice enough to replace the curry for you for something that you can handle :p Therefore, only try spicy 100 if you're prepared to die!  My favorite toppings to get are sausage, tofu katsu, or vegetables. They also have spam katsu which my boyfriend loves! They also have the best thai tea you will ever taste :D",

When reading the menu I forgot to add in the level of hotness that I wanted but I think I was given #1 since I didn't mention it. When I got it home I was pleasantly surprised at the nice amount of vegetable curry I was given. Everything was so good that I regret not taking a photo of it before I dug in. After finishing I had a good amount of curry left that I ate it the next day on some homemade rice. Can't wait to visit here again!",

They offer grilled chicken as a protein which is a healthy alternative compared to the Katsu which is my typical go to. I also love their potato croquettes and vegetables as options. You can Order a regular or small size portion but I don't think they are very different in portion size. They are a favorite when the craving hits.   Mom Rating 4/5   While they do offer high chairs many of the restaurants on Spring mountain are smaller and not as equipped for young children. Curry Zen is no different they also do not have a changing table in their bathroom which is a bit of an inconvenience.",

I always get a spicy level 4, but sometimes they are a little inconsistent with their spicy levels. Some days level 4 is perfect and sometimes it's barely even spicy. So beware!   Lastly, if you ever get the chance before it sells out...buy a curry pan! It's so delicious and a perfect little snack.",

It's located in a strip mall and has a casual vibe. They serve up lunch quickly, so it's the perfect place to grab a quick bite during the work day.   My dining companion and I started off by sharing an appetizer of fried oysters. Even though I'm not a huge oyster fan, these were wonderful! We then shared the pork tonkatsu curry at level 2 spiciness. The curry reminded me of a gravy-like sauce and was bursting with umami flavor. Level 2 spiciness was still quite spicy (which I enjoyed!). Portions aren't huge, so I definitely could have ordered my own dish.  Such a satisfying, comforting meal!",

It's just not the same when you make it at home from a box, ok? Even late on a Sunday lunch, the restaurant was crowded and people were waiting outside.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the pork katsu curry. He got level 7 spicy while I got level 3. Level 3 was a good \"medium\" level spicy - towards the end, my nose was a little runny, but the spice definitely makes it better tasting. Curry was rich and smooth though there was too much rice for how much curry sauce was actually on the plate. The pork was piping hot and I love that they don't just dump curry sauce all over the freshly fried cutlet so that it stays crispy. We got a side of the fukujinzuke which has a sweetness that provides the perfect balance to spicy curry. My only gripe is that I've never gone to a restaurant that charges you for it by 3 oz. portions. Most places just have a container of it at the table. I do wish they had some more topping options like some other chain curry restaurants.  Overall, very tasty experience with great service and we'll definitely be back.",

Tucked within a crowded and small plaza, Japanese Curry Zen is pretty much THE place to go in town for, well, good Japanese curry. They make their flavorful curry with a vegetable broth and a blend of a whole bunch of spices that together make a comforting and unforgettable taste.   Accompanied by the curry is a wide selection of meats and vegetables including tonkatsu, kurobuta sausage, deep fried shrimp, and fried tofu. I personally order the curry with either chicken katsu or grilled chicken, occasionally with spinach. You can't go wrong with any combination, really. And if I could suggest to ask for the fukujinzuke (hard to pronounce, but easy on the tastebuds), it'll give a nice sweetness to the savory plate.",

Lol  So yes I do recommend coming here if you're from here or visiting it's not too far off the strip in a little location. Parking can suck around there if you're going around dinner time so Uber it if anything. But I always am lucky enough to come when parking spaces are available.  Prices vary for Curry's around $8 and up!",

At night, it's usually busy which is to be expected, so I prefer to come earlier in the day for lunch since there isn't much of a wait. The service here is always spot on, and the servers are very polite. I usually order a half size brown rice curry with either a meat loaf, spam, or tofu katsu accompanied with scrambled eggs. The half size is a reasonable portion for me which gets me full every time. The prices here are extremely fair, so my orders never exceed $10. There have been a few times where there were hiccups. For one, my chicken katsu was undercooked so I notified a server, and they only took the price of that off of my bill. Another time, I ordered a fried egg instead of my usual scrambled egg which was a mistake. The egg was very undercooked and the whites were running through. Other than that, I have always had great experiences here the many times I've gone.",

The few who choose to not pursue the quiet lifestyle may also challenge themselves on their patience with spice tolerance.  Setting: Located in the busy monta ramen/hwaro plaza, good luck finding a parking spot in here during dinner and especially weekend times. Many flock to park in the Chinese church parking lot on the east side of the plaza but you have been warned, people's car's have been broken into in the past in this area.  Food: The fried food comes out crispy and delicious with the curry always on point. Spice level on the menu runs 1-10 but you can test your limits up to 100 (15 made my face numb and sweaty). 11-15 (same price) 16-20 (same price) on the spice price and so on.   Overall: This is the go-to for Japanese style curry with usually a 0 to 5 minute wait",

Its a small restaurant and it was pretty crowded. Not as bad as Monta Ramen across the parking lot but still a busy place.  I ordered the chicken katsu curry which is apparently their best seller. I can understand why. Tender, crispy fried chicken, a big scoop of rice and a plate full of Japanese curry. Its hard to beat.  I ordered my curry with a spice level of 3. It was perfect for me. I could maybe go as high as 4 but more spice than that might be too much. This was just right. It made my sinuses open up just enough. And it wasnt so spicy that I lost the taste of the actual curry. Japanese curry, to me, has a certain nuttiness that cuts through the pungent spice. Its not as sweet as say Thai red curry or panang curry. This is more savory. The thickness and color is reminiscent of Grandma's gravy on Thankgiving. It warms the soul.  I would give Japanese Curry Zen another go in the future. I like curries of all varieties but Japanese curry stands out in my mind. When I am in the mood for a good curry away from an Indian or Thai restaurant, Curry Zen has my vote. Good food. Fast service.  Ok pricing.",

Traveled down to Las Vegas for a quick trip with friends and decided on eating curry before the trek back to LA. Searched curry and this placed popped up with 4.5 stars. We arrived, wait was no more than 5-10 minutes and sat down.  We were all in the mood to eat some curry as it was freezing cold at night and some warm curry would do the trick. Between the table, we ordered a curry chicken katsu and I ordered the pork katsu. I added level 2 spicy to my order for a little extra kick. Also order a plate of takoyaki for the table.  The first plate arrive, the chicken katsu. Portions were nice and food looks delicious. When my plate arrive, I noticed i received significantly less curry. Was it because they added a level 2 spicy so they didn't portion it correctly? The pork katsu looks crispy on the outside but after taking the first bite, the meat was dry as jerky and none to pleasant. I powered through the katsu to get to the delicious part, the curry, The spice level was just right with the right amount of kick up sadly, I had to portion control my curry to rice ration to make sure I had enough curry. The takoyaki was a little disappointing as well. Mostly all dough with very little filling.  Will all these positive reviews, maybe we just had a bad set. Was really looking forward to that meal but who knows, very hesitant to try it again,",

The parking lot is crazy too because that complex has so many good things in it. This is my first Japanese curry place in vegas and it didn't disappoint. I just wish that they have more creative combinations like curry house in la. This is very traditional, with chicken Katsu, pork Katsu, hamburger steak, and of course the add ons you want like spinach, corn, egg (not soft boiled. Hard boiled) etc. I got the chicken Katsu and it was very moist and flavorful.  My friends got the pork Katsu and hamburger steak and they both enjoyed it. Personally I think the chicken is juicer than the pork. I also had the Takoyaki balls and they were really good. It's like a friend mash potato balls with pieces of octopus in it. Sounds really weird I know but give it a try.   If you cant eat spicy beware of even ordering a 2. It definitely has a kick to it. The scale is 1 through 10 but a 5 is super super spicy according to the waiter. The one thing I don't like about this place is that they don't automatically give you the pickled radish. If you ask they gave you a small portion of it. I had to ask 3 times cause I love that stuff. They weren't giving me attitude about it but I wish it was just out on the table like kept curry restaurants.",

    "text": "The Skinny: the curry is okay but nothing special(3) service is slow during their busy hours and the seating area is small although better than when they first opened (3), value: given the prices they charge, they should give you more curry (3).  My husband likes this place but quite frankly I could take it or leave it. In terms of flavor, the curry is not bad... but it doesn't taste like anything that special either. (Kinda like the Japanese curry you can make with House brand instant roux)  My beef is the portion size of curry relative to the amount of rice and toppings. When we first started coming, there as barely enough curry for the rice. Now, the amount of curry provided is even less than before.  So I end up leaving half of the rice behind because eating white rice at a curry joint is no fun . And I refuse to pay more for extra curry. I am not a big eater by any means but I normally need to hit Snowflake shavery next door to feel satisfied.  I normally get the spinach curry and I must say...it would be nice to get a bit more spinach in a dish that costs $9. The vegetable curry is also super skimpy on the veggies.  The katsu is okay - the coating is a bit too heavy for my taste.  Even worse, you have to ask for fukujinzuke or rakko. (Normally there is a little canister of these pickles that you can help yourself with or they put it a little on your plate when it is served.) And when they do get some for you, it's a tiny little dish of it. That is if they remember to get it for you.  Overall, this place is okay but provides Jenny Craig portion control. Service is easily overwhelmed and the seating areas are minimal (this place does a lot of takeout... which really is no fun if you order katsu).3 star review",

(It's not that far off the strip)  The restaurant itself is very small, but the workers willingly accommodated our group of 9, by pushing tables together.   Lots of different curries to choose from with many levels of spiciness. You can also customize your curry and add additional toppings. I ordered the vegetable curry and added chicken katsu with a spiciness level of ZERO! I also ordered a side of curry pan.  Everything was yummysss. Curry pan was big. Enough to share with someone else. The curry was perfect, not to thin and not to thick either. The portion size was huge too. I couldn't finish it...  One thing I would comment on is that the curry was a little bit on the saltier side. Maybe it's just me since I'm more sensitive to salt. If it was just a bit less salty, then it would have been perfect.  So sad there's no Curry Zen in LA... Curry House just can't compare..",

And my number 5 curry with chicken katsu, spinach and 16 grain rude was very good. I also order the half portion Beavis the probs are very big her and each item is stacked.. As in you get the full size piece of chicken and the full-size order of spinach when you order both.  My table mates had pork katsu and more vegetables. The curry is the real star with a ton of flavor. And so far it's one of my cheapest meals in Vegas clocking in at $16 with tip :).",

    "text": "Such a nice restaurant with really great food with great staff showing great customer service.  This place specializes in curry which is very similar to CoCo Ichibanya. Their whole menu and ordering system is also very similar. You get to choose the spicy level with extra charge and you can also add toppings as you like such as pork katsu, croquette, corn and etc.  I really enjoyed my Chicken Katsu Curry with spicy level 2 since I cant really eat spicy food. Anyway, it was perfect to my liking and the katsu was large and the meat was very tender. Curry was very simple but had the taste of curry and it wasnt missing anything though it just looks BROWN.  The guy server who was shorter than the other guy (there were two), was super super nice and kind. I enjoyed my dinner a lot more because of his attentive service and his kindness. He filled up my water cup even before I asked. I drink lots of water so thats always a plus!  I will come back here and tell my friends to visit when they come to Vegas!",

Fried spam was the highlight of my night. The curry was a 2 star, and the fried spam brings this place up to a 3 star. I don't know if they still have it on the menu since I had it about a year ago. Perhaps this place has improved itself since then, as I am seeing higher reviews. I shall find out again later if I visit.",

There is no host stand, but they do have a piece of paper and a pen for you to write your name down. I ordered the pork katsu curry, level 2, and added corn and cheese. I also got a sprite and an order of gyoza.  The food came out quickly. The gyoza were just placed on the table and a moment later my entree was being delivered. Gyoza were crispy and hot, and I enjoyed the dipping sauce. The curry was just okay, but mind you I have never had Japanese curry before. I thought the corn and cheese were yummy additions though. The spice level 2 was just perfect for me. The pork katsu was crispy and delicious and I found myself eating that by itself because I realized I am not really a fan of Japanese curry. But certainly that is no fault of Zen's. I may not be back, but I would definitely say check this place out.",

The restaurant was small but accommodated around 25-30 people. The service was quick and we got our food pretty quickly.   We ordered curry with chicken, chicken katsu don, fried oysters, and takoyaki. For the curry with chicken, I thought the plate was large in my opinion and surely should be enough to satisfy your hunger. I thought the curry was flavoured well and the chicken was tender. The chicken katsu don was also a big portion with plenty of egg and rice. I felt so bad I couldn't finish it but there was a good amount of food in that bowl. The katsu don tasted great and reminded me of homestyle cooking.   The fried oysters came in 3 pieces and was decently priced. I absolutely love takoyaki! It was not too sweet or salty and that dish alone had a good amount of it. Takoyaki is a fun plate to share with a group of friends.   Overall, cheap place with good food. I recommend coming here especially if you want to take a break from seeing your savings disappear at the casino.",

The service is absolutely amazing, and if you are a repeat customer (like myself and my boyfriend) the employees actually take the time to remember you. We get an extremely warm welcome every time we come in! The food always comes out quickly and it's always fresh and hot. I LOVE drinking the J Pop alcoholic beverages they have available here too. Try the white peach flavor and thank me later.  Pretty much this place is fantastic, and if you are on the fence about coming here, DO IT!!!!

This is not your ordinary Indian or Chinese curry. It's a secret Japanese style that is usually cooked hours on end. I don't know how this recipe is prepared or how long it's cooked but it tasted really good. You can get it in a range of how spicy you like the dish from 1-10.

The heat rating system was new to me since it went it to 10.  I had 7 twice and might actually bump up to 10 next time!  Both times, I got vegetable curry with some sort of protein.

Curry Zen is a very small space, but very clean and cute, and I couldn't have felt more welcome. The staff there seemed genuinely happy to serve us and make sure we were okay during our short visit, which cinched me wanting to come back here (if the food didn't already!).   Both of us ordered the same meal - Tofu Cutlet Curry with brown rice, and added corn and added vegetables.   The presentation of this is quite nice (although it's hard to make curry look appealing) and the taste was out of this world! Just the right amount of spice and it seems so rich but still with a light feel. The tofu cutlets were definitely the stars of the show and I hope they keep it on the menu because they were fabulous - lightly breaded and fried and just crazy delicious. The amount of corn (add on 50 cents for about 1/3 cup) was decent, however for a $2 add on of vegetables there was maybe half a cup in there and it was drowned in the curry sauce. I wish there was a bit more for the price offered. If you looked at the plate, you wouldn't have seen the $2 veggies except for a couple potatoes popping up from it.   All in all though, both of us practically licked our plates clean and also were out of there in less than a half hour - it hit all the right spots! I will definitely be back although the price was a little up there for a vegan curry plate. However I will be adding it to my favorite vegan-friendly destinations and will think of this plate of deliciousness often!",

The menu contains sausage, pork, chicken, shrimp. Most of it is breaded and fried but they also have just grilled chicken and pork. Also the plates come with curry, obviously and rice.  The food tastes amazing the curry flavor is really strong and tasteful. The sausages were my favorite and the fried shrimp.  The price is also a good plus for 2 people it only cost us $25. I would definitely return here.",

    "text": "I would consider myself a regular here, coming here mostly during lunch breaks. My usual go-to order is a chicken katsu curry with spinach. The spinach adds an additional different flavor to the curry itself, and with its texture mixed with that of the chicken and rice together makes a great combo. The food usually comes out pretty quick, and the services is often very good. I've only had one bad experience with the service recently. I had ordered my usual, chicken katsu with spinach. However, the order that came out was only a plate of rice with spinach, no chicken. So I had let them know, and they apologized and brought out a separate plate of chicken katsu. But that process even took much longer than it should have. It might have been the service herself who made the mistake, because at times I would see new faces taking orders. This experience doesn't hinder me from going back, because it's a great place for Japanese curry, probably the best in town. Love it here, would go back for more lunches to come.",

It's is relatively \"healthy\", delicious, fast and affordable. Not to mention that is one of the cleanest Japanese spots In the area.   Menu is very limited with few protein variations of the same rice and curry plate. There are few toppings or add ons. I have tried chicken katsu and pork cutlet with croquette toppings. I really like the condiments: almonds, sweet onions and radish. You can also request brown rice as a side.   I've tried the tofu dessert, also very tasty.   Seoul Plaza has to be the one of the foodiest spots in the city. Add JCZ to the list.",

The Pork Katsu was slightly dry though the actually breading was light and crispy.  The curry was actually good but I was missing the traditional potato and carrots.   Instead I had a half a plate of curry sauce that drowned the rice and pork katsu.  The best thing was that they gave me an endless supply of pickled radish which is the perfect condiment to this dish.  Even though it was not the best for me as I have high standards,  I would still recommend trying them out.",

When we found Yelpers raving about this place, we thought we'd give it a shot - and we're glad we did!  The menu is very simple, because it doesn't have to be complicated. Pick a protein, pick white or brown rice, and enjoy the curry. My wife was pleased that they have tofu katsu, and I enjoyed the chicken. We both tried croquettes on the side, which were fine but ultimately took a backseat the curry awesomeness on the main plate. The proprietary spice blend is so delicious that they prepared a special card on the table explaining everything in it. I'm craving it now just thinking about it.  The place was deserted when we arrived, which meant that the waiter stood at attention for the duration of our meal. It was a little weird, but at least it meant that it was never hard to get a drink refill. (Unfortunately, speaking of drinks, pop is served only in cans - no fountain.)  Oh! And the price! This place is super-economical. I can't remember the last time I had a sit-down dinner for two under $30.  Delicious, attentive and cheap. This place hits the trifecta and I can't wait to go back!",

The taste was ok, but it definitely could've used some vegetables. Yes, they have corn, but something green would've been nice. It would've lent the dish some freshness too, I think. What with the rice, the croquette, the breaded chicken and the brown sauce, it just seemed kind of monotonous to me.

    "text": "I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being \"good\" and \"great\". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness.   This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.  Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it.   Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits.   I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to \"BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!\", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the True story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.  The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes.   This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into \"Sushi on Rainbow\", it's like that scene in \"Goodfellas\" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years.   JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not True. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.",

Prices are super cheap, the dish is very filling, and extremely good! They even have a brown rice option if you are looking to avoid white rice. (Huge plus in my opinion.)  Staff was super nice, and the owner (possibly also the chef?) even checked up on us to see if we were enjoying the food. I know sometimes people do not like Asian restaurants because of the service, but this is one of the only ones with great service.   I would like to see some more items added to the menu sometime in the future so that when I get tired of gorging myself on curry I can still come and enjoy a meal. (Or even more options for dessert.)  If you like curry, this place is a must go!",

Based on reviews, I made sure that during some business one day in vegas I made the time to stop in for lunch. No disappointments here. This place is awesome. The only complaint is it is tiny! So you gotta eat and run so the folks hanging outside the front door can get some great food also! I am a fan of the beef curry and potato croquets. I ordered a side of curry cause I like the rice and beef swimming in it!  They keep it simple and I think this has helped them become successful. Not all curry is created equal.....",

Condiments like pickled vegetables and sliced almonds were available on the table. I suggest trying them all. The curry pan was toasty, crunchy but still light and fluffy.

    "text": "Curry!  OMG do I love Curry... Indian Curry, Thai Curry, Japanese Curry-it's all good.. The amalgamation of spices, creating that distinct, deep, rich, umber slurry, with heavenly wafts filling my nostrils; you literally taste it through your olfactory senses like an emotion or a memory (Curry is my Pavlov's dog)..  Curry is a favorite from my childhood; just before spending the Summer vacation in Japan, My Mom would make batches of Curry and hundreds of Fried Dumplings for my Dad to eat while we were gone.  I loved hanging out in the kitchen, helping her cook these dishes, and it is distinctly home cooking.  Curry Zen is located in the same Commercial Center as Monta, Raku and Trattoria Nakamuraya, making it's own 'Little Tokyo' deep in the heart of Chinatown.  It's a small venue with only a couple of tables and a counter, so you can imagine there's a prime, rush hour wait - makes sense to time carefully with this restaurant.  But it's clearly a family run business with Husband and Wife manning the kitchen, which is endearing.    The Curry is a simple gravy, made entirely from Spices and Vegetables.  It has the consistency somewhere between a sauce and stew, with deep but clean flavors that highlight each Spice in a way I've never tasted.  Almost a science, a brief explanation is on a placard on each table (in Japanese) describing the ingredients and methodology- one thing that I find about Japanese culture is the cult like devotion to the culinary process.  On the table, you find various condiments that I find unusual, but welcoming: Almond and Raisins for one, then as the Curry is spicy but not hot, there's a bevy of dry spices to ramp up the heat.  I enjoyed working with a sprinkling of Mild, then incrementally moving towards Hot Chili Peppers.  Along with the Curry, there's a selection of toppings and fried accompaniments: such a Chicken or Pork Tonkatsu, Croquettes, Fried Shrimp and Vegetables. I really enjoy the fact that I can customize my Curry, and I immediately wanted to 'load up' on the fried goodies:  I ordered the Pork Tonkatsu and Fried Shrimp.  Now given the price point, the Tonkatsu was amazing; not your tough, thin piece of stringy meat, Curry Zen presented a really good piece of Pork that was fried perfectly and for an extra $3.50, it's a steal!  The breaded Shrimp was properly cooked and a great mini addition to counter the Tonkastu, you can never have enough fried meat on your plate is my philosophy!  I enjoyed the service, both the Husband and Wife repeatedly asked me how my dish tasted and I appreciated their attentiveness.  And I know I will be coming back, not only for the food, but I want to support the smaller businesses in Vegas and these are good people!

The Pork Katsu was a little tuff, could have been tenderized a little more but the flavor of the curry was spot on and spice level 5 was just right not to hot not to mild.   The restaurant is fairly small though so don't plan on bringing a big group here. Perfect if you're by yourself cause you can pull up to the bar and put down some rice and curry.   Parking is ruff in this little shopping center, I think there are more restaurants than parking spots, so you may have to loop around a couple times or take a chance parking on the street or better yet just get it to go...",

You can get a nicely crafted plate of Japanese curry for a quick and budget lunch at this new spot!    They serve both brown and white rice with the one thing they make here: curry.  The menu is extremely simple... what kind of meat do you want on your curry?  Condiments include raisins, ginger, some sort of pickled beat type of thing that is amazingly good, almonds, and three different heat levels of spice.  I suggest you add everything to your curry!  Yum!  Even for a Thai curry snob, the curry here is spiced extremely well.  The flavors are balanced with herbs and a slight sweetness.  I have had the fried shrimp and fried pork on my curry so far, and both have been done very well, not too greasy or too breaded and with quality ingredients.    The price for a plate of curry here ranges from $4.50 (no meat) to around $8.50.  You really can't beat that price for a quick meal out.  The curry here is better than the one served at Shuseki and Ichiza, so give this little spot a try!",

The place is kinda small and the \"waiting list\" is just a sheet of paper you have to write your own name on and they'll call you when there's a table ready.   It's just west of Decatur on Spring Mountain. It's in the same shopping center as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea, and Raku.   I'd never had japanese curry before.  I got the chicken katsu+curry spicy level 2+corn+cheese. I left a $4 tip and the total was $15.52.  I can see why this is crave-worthy.  The only thing I can compare it to is curry-wurst in Germany.  It's like a thick brown gravy with curry in it.  The chicken was fried perfectly in a panko coating but was incredibly bland.  Maybe it's supposed to be like that to balance the strong curry.  The rice was wonderfully sticky and the cheese made the whole dish feel comforting.    Level 2 spicy was just enough...my white girl palette can only handle so much.  It would be really good with french fries I bet.  I liked it and I'd eat it again.",

I got the vegetable curry with tofu katsu, and my boyfriend got the pork katsu curry with a spice level of 8. He loved his dish, and the spiciness was intense, but delicious - aka not just spicy for the sake of spice. My curry was amazing, and the tofu katsu was deliciously crunchy. I was so happy they had a vegetarian curry on the menu! I assume it was vegan, but I didn't think to verify.  We had only ever had japanese curry made from store-bought blocks, and this knocked it out of the park. When we're in Vegas again, we'll definitely be back!",

Some may say that there's simply nothing too special about it but hey, that's your opinion. For the rest of us who do enjoy the simplicity of this place, we think of something more. To me, personally, I find comfort here.   With excellent food comes an excellent workforce. These two elements come hand in hand to produce the overall business and Curry Zen, I would like to give you guys a round of applause. You guys are the bridge to the production of these beautifully crafted dishes.  One more thing to add on to that, the prices are affordable! So technically, not only do you get good food, you don't break the bank either!   Overall, I encourage you first timers to have a go at this place, it definitely will not disappoint and is worth trying out. And to the rest of us who's been dining here for some time now, we all know why we keep coming back.  Nice touch on the new updated menu by the way.",

The curry sauce is pretty spicy and I only got a level 3 so be careful if you're sensitive to heat. The service was great and I have no complaints there.

Their sides like takoyaki are also amazing.  Be sure to add the radish and scallion pickles to your meal.  The scallions reminded me of my mother in-law's huge jar that I could never get enough of.

The katsu was juicy, but it was a little too oily. My biggest gripe is that the curry doesn't come with pickles, which is a necessity for Japanese curry. I think they charge extra for it, but that just seems stingy.  Service: 4  Our waitress was nice and patient with such a large group. She did a great job taking everyone's order, especially when there are so many specifications in a single dish with Japanese curry.  Note that the bill can only be split 4 ways, so plan accordingly if you have a large group!  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant seems fairly small, but it has a decent amount of seating. And, unlike many other Japanese restaurants, can seat a larger group easily. Parking is a little difficult because the plaza has several busy shops, but it shouldn't take too long to find a spot.",

We all went for a late dinner around 9:30pm on a Saturday and luckily the place had several open tables for our group of 8.  Service is outstanding, the waitresses were very friendly and quick. So we got the Pork Katsu Curry, Chicken Katsu Curry, some takoyaki, and kaarage chicken. So for the curry, our cousins usually got spicy level 5, so I went along with that and my brother, guess he felt a little spice challenge so he got level 7.  The takoyaki was so-so but the kaarage chicken was pretty good. I believe they were both around $4.50. The portions for the chicken were slightly disappointing though. So first of all, the katsu was on point, loved both the chicken and pork, but recommend pork more. The curry though lacked a bit of flavor, just mediocre. It could be because of the spice but anyways it wasn't the best of curries I've tried. So for spiciness for the curry, level 5 spiciness was ok I guess but may be a bit too spicy for most people. I felt a little burn in my chest after my meal, but it wasn't too bad. I would recommend level 3 or maybe even 4 for new people. And as you can guess my brother did not expect that level of spice, but he said he still enjoyed it. Although he also did say his curry tasted like Taco Bell's hot sauce haha. So basically once spice level goes over 5, it'll probably taste more like hot sauce than curry sauce.  Portions were reasonable for the price and taste I think. Overall, not sure if I'll be back but it was an ok meal.",

The menu indicates a 1-10 based spice level, but trust me, you can go beyond that. They charge extra on 5 range increment. So if you're thinking of going for an 11, it'll cost you the same to get a 15.   I'll try it next time I'm here, but they have Kirin beer!  The food honestly doesn't look like much when the bring it out to you, but it's the perfect amount. The chicken is always fresh and nothing ever tastes old :)",

Hubby loves curry so we thought, hey, there is a curry joint, let's try it... spur of the moment thing and it was surprisingly yummy.  We ordered a beef curry, added an egg and corn and we also ordered katsu don.  Ok, curry is not my go-to food.  I ordered the katsu don because of that.  One taste of the curry, I immediately regretted my decision.  Not that their katsu don was bad, but it's because their curry is that good.  We even only ordered a level \"3\" spice.  And that was perfect for us.  A small kick but not stealing the flavor.  It packed so much flavor and the beef was so tender, I wish we could stay in Vegas longer so I can have another meal here.  I also love how cute the place was.  The servers were all very friendly and it has that 'home' feel.  Parking is a bit nasty though....",

My face lit up with the first bite. It's hard not to smile when the curry is so rich and thick and flavorful.   I like my curry simple with just a chicken or pork cutlet. I prefer the pork to the chicken although both are really good. The panko crust is my favorite part and I love how it stands up to the curry even until the last bite. Perfect curry to rice ratio. Great prices but sizes are just a tad small. I scraped the plate clean and left wishing I had more!",

It drives me bonkers but at the end of the day it's just too good. If you haven't had Japanese curry you won't be disappointed. I'll leave this one short and sweet. As always happy hunting.",

For staters we like their fried gyoza (5 pieces $4.50). Tako yaki (5 pieces $4.50).   My favorite curry is the chicken katsu curry level 3 ($9.95). Nice juicy tender chicken katsu and their famous curry is the winner. Do you want beef?  Then try the beef curry which also nice and tender beef chunks ($11.20).   Only thing I have to warn you about is that you ask who is the cook. I say this as you can choose your spice level from level one to ten. But if it's a Thai cook, it will be really hot. Yes people that I know who really do like hot said oh my. So you might want to ask who the cook is and choose your level of spice from there. My friend got a negative two. I had to laugh but he can't handle spicy at all but he loves the taste as everyone that i brought here does.   Winding down from a hard day at work or just want an adult beverage?  They have Japanese beer and sake.  Yes they also have a variety of soft drinks too.   Another reason we like coming here is a awesome waitress named Tavia. We are bummed that she will be leaving here for another job. Very sad we won't be able to see her the next time we come.  Thank you Tavia for always taking care of us.",

Parking is a little hard and is located in the same shopping plaza as Raku, Big Wong etc. They offer a variety of curry dishes, with spice level. The restaurant is small and the place was busy. I felt the tables were too close, my only pet peeve.  I went with the Japanese Meat loaf curry. The portion was bigger than I thought and the meatloaf was done perfectly and well-seasoned. I ordered Medium spice level 3 and was glad I could feel the heat. Many curry places don't give enough rice, but the rice on my plate was definitely enough to soak up the curry. I ate about half and was able to save the rest for the next day! Also the service was friendly.  Overall, we had a solid meal here and would come back whenever I'm craving curry.",

Zen Curry has a smaller interior compared to other restaurants. Because of its small interior, it can be hard to hear people when it gets busy. You can smell curry throughout the whole restaurant.   Quality/Quantity: 5/5 I always love going to Zen Curry for their chicken katsu curry with cheese and spice level 3/4. The quality of the food has exceptional flavor. The curry and chicken go hand in hand. When you combine it with rice, it's a perfect trio. The quantity of the food is reasonable for the size that is given. Bare in mind that you can also get the curry in a half size if you have a hard time finishing the original size.   Experience: 5/5 Hands down, my favorite Japanese curry spot in the city and my favorite quick stop to grab food. Servers are more attentive and respectful. They are willing to help you if you are not quite sure what to order. The food comes out quickly and the smell of the curry is just heavenly.",

I have only done take out from here so far, but even as a take out customer, the staff still treats me like I am dining at there. They have me take a seat and ask me if I would like a glass of water while I wait.   The first couple of times I've been here I got the same thing. Original curry with pork katsu and kurobota sausage with corn. Recently I tried the 5 piece kushi and it was delicious. I also asked if I could get a couple of extra skewers of quail eggs and I could and I did!   I would like to try some of the other choices so I will definitely be back.",

I always get the chicken katsu with the normally-spiced curry, and it is positively blissful.   Though I am so in love with the chicken katsu that I have no desire to branch out, friends and family have gotten a variety of items from the menu, and always devour whatever they choose (with the solitary exception of the takoyaki, which, I think, was not quite what my friend thought it was).   I almost always get a Thai iced tea (delicious!), and have, on many occasions, barely been able to resist the temptation to order multiple servings of the chicken katsu, and eat nothing else for days! Like I said - bliss!",

    "text": "Japanese Curry Zen. I've never eaten Japanese curry before, so I decided to try it for the first time at this highly-rated establishment. The photos of white rice and brown curry on plain white plates did not stimulate my appetite (slightly unappetizing looking), however, those 150 Yelpers before me could not all be wrong. For our late lunch, we shared a regular-size order of rice and curry (spice level 0) with the 5 piece Kushi Curry option. I'm not sure of the \"right\" way to eat curry, so I mixed together the rice and curry slurry and dug in. Mmm. Wow, it's really very yummy, a fantastic combination of spices. The skewers of fried goodies were all pretty good too. I really liked the potato croquette. It was something like mashed potatoes rolled in an egg mixture and coated with panko, then lovingly lowered it into the deep fryer. The panko-coated fried quail eggs were slightly rubbery and had a green-grey tinge around the yolk, but no biggie. Most people boil the heck out of eggs.   Yelp did me right. Thank you!  *Low prices  *Filling, low-brow tasty Asian fare *Nice service *Tiny hole in the wall with a few bar stools and (three?) small tables, so try to come at off-peak meal times. The tables seat four, so when a group of six came in, they stood in the middle of the restaurant and watched the two parties of two eat their food. Awkward! I wouldn't mind some breathing room to scarf down my lunch... :P",

At first we got there & it was nearly packed (lunch time).  Our waitress seemed rushed and didn't let me finish ordering my food, still polite though.  This didn't matter once the food came.  My husband and I were VERY impressed at the quality of Zen's curry.  Best in town. Hands down, no argument.    Unlike other curry places in town, like Kaba Curry:  They serve my favorite, deep fried oysters.  The tables have condiments for you to personalize your curry with, like raisins, almonds, katsu sauce, hot spice shaker, rakkyo, and especially fukujinsuke (pickled radish).  The way a Japanese curry restaurant should be.  The menu is simple, but you can play it up however you like.  Zen doesn't need a fancy menu to have superior food or fancy decor, unlike other curry places.  The owner himself is very nice and seems to always be hard at work in the back.  We plan on coming here from now on for our curry craving & plan on bringing more friends along on too!  Love it!",

While I preferred my curry sans these additions, I did appreciate the new flavor profiles - crunchy texture from the almonds and a subtle sweetness from the raisins).  My katsu was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. I also went for level 6 (out of 10) on spicy, but the heat wasn't very strong.

The first bite is nice and flavorful; however, as you continue downing your meal, you find yourself becoming more and more addicted with each bite!  It doesn't really matter what meat/vegetables you order; it is definitely the curry sauce that makes the meal here.  Thinking about the curry right now while writing this review is making me want to go back to Vegas just to have some more of it. Yum!  Note: Their curry spice levels are pretty spicy in general; two people in our party ordered level 3 (out of 10), and they already thought that was pretty spicy.  I ordered a 5 and was sweating quite a bit by the end of my meal as well.  Another note:  The place is pretty darn small, so don't be surprised if you end up needing to wait a little bit to get a seat!",

This Chef is serious, if you order a 10, you're gonna feel it, and it's gonna feel good :)  Since I'm not a big rice eater, I loved that I could add veggies and spinach to my curry. I didn't have to waste precious stomach space on starches, woohoo. The pork katsu was cooked to perfection, not too chewy and krispy just right. Prices were reasonable and the service was lovely.

Service was rather quick.  I had the chicken curry with cheese and she had the pork curry with cheese.  Our food arrived within 10 minutes.    Food was delicious.  I have never had Japanese curry before so I can't compare it.  They provide a good portion of rice, lightly breaded and fried chicken with curry and cheese.  I thought it would be weird to have the cheese with the curry but it was actually tasty and all the ingredients meshed well together.  A great combination.    Service was awesome.

I was bummed that Cafe de Japon had closed down a year ago, the curry experience was one of the best I'd ever had.  This small restaurant, located in the same shopping cul-de-sac as Kung Fu Tea and a questionable Massage parlor in Chinatown is very nice and the food is very good. They have daily specials which is on the board, today's listed special curry udon, pan fried or deep fried gyoza or shumai, and a fried oysters appetizer which looked tempting.    They had the standard Japanese curry menu with a decent amount of curry selections. I ordered the pork katsu curry, which was fairly priced at around $10, although I was tempted to order the tenderloin pork katsu. The pork katsu was really good, though nothing that exceptional and well breaded.  The curry was flavorful and sweet, though not overly.  You are able to order various levels of curry which range from .20+ depending on the level of spiciness on a scale of 1-10.  I ordered 5, which is actually pretty spicy and cost 40cents more.  If you're looking for a well rounded med spicy level, go with 3 or 4 instead.  Decent parking, good service.  Will get full especially during lunch as it's kind of small.  Recommended.",

I require this stuff just to survive. When I first moved to Vegas a few years ago, I was going through some serious withdrawals, and then I found this place. I was relieved to find that this place does the job.  There are basically two types of curry that are standard in Japanese cooking. First, there is the roux (or however you spell that) over rice with some meat bits in it. Then there is the cutlet curry which is a big slice of whatever protein you chose on top of rice, covered with the roux. I always get some sort of cutlet curry because I don't see the point otherwise.  Now if you have one of those big \"American\" appetites, the standard serving isn't going to cut it for you. But fear not! There are plenty of add-ons you can choose as well as some good appetizers. Also, like any good curry place, there is a scale of spiciness from 0-10 I believe. 0 is pretty much non-existent. I usually go with 3 or 4 and my Korean friends think I'm weak. You start paying extra after 6. I think 10 would be suitable for someone like my mom who likes to take a big chunk of wasabi and eat it straight up before her meal just to cleanse her palate. If this is your first time, take it easy with the spice. There are also two rice types you can choose. The standard white rice, and the purple rice with beans. The purple rice is very healthy for you and it doesn't taste like shit so give it a try. Another cool trend that has been going on in Japan that this place also does is that they provide Tonkatsu sauce at your table for you to add on to your roux. It adds a very good flavor. I don't know why I always see people getting scared to try this. It's good. Just try it. Don't be vanilla.  Finally, the service is very good. Most of the workers actually speak Japanese and they know how to treat the customers well. That always makes me want to leave my money there. This joint isn't huge, and as everyone knows, this plaza can get mad crowded so do expect a wait during peak hours.",

The katsu was breaded very lightly and it didn't feel too heavy. The rice was perfectly steamed. The curry was rich and creamy. The rice to curry ratio is perfection. I always finished my dish without any rice or curry to spare.  Spicy level 3 was already a good kick for me -- my spice tolerance is pretty low.   I also tried the veggie curry which was perfect for me that day. I was feeling sick that time and the veggie dish was so hearty.",

I had two other people in my group and between us we tried the chicken katsu curry, pork katsu curry, Japanese meatloaf curry, and the curry udon. The curry was basic, but cooked well. The sauce was flavorful and the katsu was piping hot!   As good as the curry rice dishes were, the curry udon unanimously was our favorite. Broth and noodles were on point!   You can pick the spicy level on all of the curry dishes. I don't normally do too spicy, just a mild kick and level 3 was perfect for me. The waitress said most people go with a 5 or 6, but it goes all the way to 10!",

It has the perfect consistency, it's not too thick or runny.  I asked for a spice level of 2 and I could feel the spice in the back of my throat, but it did not overpower the taste of the curry. I've been cutting carbs out lately so I avoid rice when I can, but this is one of the places that is the exception. I can't stop eating, it's just too good!   Ordering is simple. You get to pick your rice/size, choice of meat, and toppings (I like to add cheese).  They also offer additional spices, pickled onions, radish, almonds, and raisins. I add in the hot powder, pickled onions, and radish to give it that extra kick. It sends my taste buds over the top!  The service is great here! I was driving around the area with my dog and decided to get some to go. It was 11:15 AM and I didn't realize they open at 11:30, but they happily took my order and said that it would be ready by 11:30 since they're just waiting for the rice to cook. I sat in my car and at 11:30 sharp, the server came out to give me the food. I couldn't wait to eat it, so I had a go at it in my car. To my surprise, the owner came out and said hi to me & my dog and asked how I liked it.",

Customer service was friendly, quick, and accommodating.  The setting is casual, nice to hang out and chat with friends.   There's a good selection of starters and sides. The fried shumai was tasty,  served with a little shredded cabbage and spicy mustard, if a bit on the pricy side (6 for about $4). I guess the main attraction would be the curry itself. I liked the sauce overall.  It was flavorful with a good consistency, not to runny or thick.  I thought the spice was a little lacking, though.  I'm someone who usually orders the spiciest I can,  and the 10/10 (which they charge extra for) had just a little kick for me. Lots of variety in the accompaniments.  I recommend the kushi 5pc and pork cutlet mmmm fried foods!",

Lately I haven't been able to eat it because of personal reasons. BUT...I do not regret coming in Japanese Curry Zen not one bit!  I ordered the katsu curry with brown rice and veggies on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Katsu curry with a spice level 7. The cool thing about this place is that you can customize the spice level, and add on extra spices (such as turmeric, cumin, oregano, etc) depending on your liking. Cool right?! I've never even heard of such a thing!!   Service- it was fast and convenient. They were pretty busy when we came to eat, so I say come around the afternoon. Probably after lunch.",

I normally go with either chicken katsu or beef with spinach and croquette. You can't really go wrong with any of the proteins, they're all so good! Croquette is very tasty, it is pretty much a fried, breadcrumbed mashed potato with some vegetables. Make sure to also ask for some Daikon/pickled radish as it sort of refreshes your palette.    Adding spinach makes the curry a lot thicker so if you would rather have a runnier curry that makes the ratio equal.. I would either recommend getting extra curry or omit the spinach.  As for appetizers, make sure to get the Takoyaki! It is a must-have every time I visit Curry Zen. Can never go wrong with it.",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 70/100  My Hawai'i friends were in town and this is their fave place for Japanese Curry in Vegas! It was my first time here, I'm not usually a fan of curry (had a bad experience) but when I tried Curry Zen it was onoliscious and I surprisingly, cleaned my plate!   I got the curry with spinach and scrambled eggs and brown rice. It comes with a few slices of tomato as well. The curry for this plate is a darker color than the usual brown that's served with the other curry plates. I'm keeping it healthy these days, so I'm glad I saw this vegetarian option on the menu! I enjoyed it and like I said I cleaned off all the curry on my plate. It was flavorful. The brown rice was cooked well too and went well with the spinach and curry.   I also appreciated the health benefits of spices in their curry, listed on their menu.  And they use a vegetable broth for their curry. I wish I had seen the mixed multi grain rice, I would've ordered that instead of the brown rice.   Had the fried gyoza as well, and it was just okay. I've had better, but nothing bad about this one.   5 star friendly service here. Kind, friendly and welcoming Japanese servers. Our server was awesome. It's a small restaurant, able to fit maybe 30 patrons at most, so there may be a wait. We went during lunch time and it was busy. They also serve Japanese beer, sake and wine, so you can get your drink on.   Next time I'm here, I'm looking forward to trying the curry pan, mixed grain rice, and other fried options.",

    "text": "Talk about surpassing expectations. While the dishes look quite plain, the flavor of the curry was simply amaZEN.  Takoyaki -- 6 deliciously crispy balls filled with firm octopus. The batter was perfectly crispy with just the right amount of tenkasu filling. There were tons of bonito shavings on top to give it that extra seafood flavor.  Pork Katsu -- Dark brown curry, mild in taste with just a hint of sweetness. They have custom spice levels 1-10 and to be safe per the waiter's suggestion, I stuck with level 5. Their pork cuts are thin and tender, with a satisfyingly thin layer of crust.   As one who grew up with Curry House, this place blows them out of the water. Their curry is much thicker with much more depth of flavor. If you're looking for warm comfort food, keep this place in mind!",

Once we got home (South Henderson) opened up to a plate of rice, curry sauce, and the addons.  So we didn't end up eating anything that night.  Came back the next day to resolve the issue because it seems a little unfair that we didn't receive what we ordered. Apparently the server that night only charged us for curry sauce and the add ons. Doesn't really make any sense as to why we would order just that. & she even actually repeated the order to us, at the table..  So who ever was in charge the next day, didn't help either.   Kinda sucks bcuz this place was pretty cool.",

I love the katsu toppings - I got chicken and a croquette. Both were crunchy and crispy on the outside but moist (and the chicken was tender) on the inside. I've never had spinach incorporated into my curry sauce but I really liked it (but I also really like spinach)! I don't think I can go back to just plane curry. Service was fast and friendly!",

I always get the same thing (half size Japanese meatloaf and fried egg curry with red radish and takoyaki) and I've never left disappointed. The servers are also all really nice and most of the time always ask if everything is okay. I 100% recommend coming here if you've never been! Also, just gotta add the price PERFECT.

Our family ordered Curry Pan and Fired Oysters to start things off. Curry Pan is like a giant fried dumpling with curry flavored vegetables inside. The oysters were crispy outside but still fresh ocean flavor with fresh oyster texture inside.   Next, we ordered the Curry Udon with side of a fried egg (spicy level 7), Vegetable Curry with Chicken Katsu and Brown Rice, and a side fried egg (spicy level 7), Chicken Katsu Curry with a side of Croquette on white rice (spicy level 1). They rate spicy level from 1 to 10, and they have curry powder and red pepper powder on every table to spice up yours if you like and they also have Sriracha Sauce available for the asking.   We shared all our dishes and loved every bite. Katsus was cooked crispy and tender inside and croquette was such a hit that we almost ordered another one but decided to save room for dessert.  Japanese Curry Zen has a very casual setting with prompt service...we were in and out in about 40 minutes.    I will go back in a heartbeat to Japanese Curry Zen with more excitement than I had for the first visit knowing how great their menus is.",

After reading the other reviews,  someone stated a 5 was as spicy as a 9, so I got the 5. Was it burning hot? No. But it was full of flavor. I think I'll try the 9 next time. Husby got a 1 and said after so many bites, the heat builds up and couldn't finish it. My 6 year old finished it for him.  So if you can't handle any bit of heat, stick with the mild flavor. My daughter ate the curry udon in the mild flavor. It came with onions, green onions and bits of chicken. She loved it but couldn't finish it since polishing off her dad's plate. The mild taste a bit sweet with ZERO spice and is very tasty.  The fried shumai also comes with a spicy mustard sauce, like the hot mustard from Chinese restaurants. I personally love shumai fried now.   We all enjoyed our meal.  Our service was polite even w/ the limited English our waiter spoke. I'll definitely be back when visiting LV again.",

I ordered the chicken katsu with a lower spice level (1-5), if you go beyond 6-10, it's a little extra. Ojiisan (grandpa), working his magic on every order.   Fast, delicious, friendly service.

    "text": "So apparently this little strip mall called Seoul Plaza is the Asian Food mecca of Las Vegas...  There are no less than 5 outstanding restaurants in this mall according to Yelp - the already famous Raku; Kabuto which some claim is the best sushi in town; the unique-in-Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya; Monta Ramen which had lines waiting to be seated; Big Wong's representing Asian street food culture, and the little gem that is Japanese Curry Zen.  I guess jury is still out on Chung Gi Wa, a Korean restaurant that translates to Blue Roof, since I can't find a Yelp review on it.  We were really looking for a donkatsu place (can anyone suggest a good one in Vegas?), and found this place around the corner from where we were.  Not exactly a katsu joint, but we like curry so decided to give it a try.  4.5 stars on 270+ reviews can't be wrong, right?  Well, the only thing I'm wondering at this point is - what happened to the other .5 star?  Because honestly this is the best curry I've ever had.  I am quickly realizing that Vegas has L.A. beat when it comes to Japanese food not named sushi.  Only if Udon West (NYC joint with the absolute greatest gyu don ever)  came to the West...  Anyway, upon walk-in you are greeted by practically everyone working there - including the older gentleman behind the counter who appears to be the owner-chef.  The all-male crew is super friendly, attentive, and speedy.  The decor is simple clean.  Domestic beer is $2.50.  Off to a good start.  We order a curry pan, a katsu curry and a shrimp curry.  Curry pan comes in literally 2 minutes, and it's piping hot (on a side note, I realized then that \"pan\" is Japanese for bread - which I should have guessed because \"ppang\" is Korean for bread...).  And this thing is AMAZING good.  Koreans call this croquette, but none that I've had in a Korean bakery comes anywhere close to this little piece of addiction.  I should have gotten 3 more of these and called it a day.  But then, I would have missed out on their equally amazing curry.  The curry dishes come 5 minutes later, and I'm initially a bit disappointed.  3 smallish pieces of fried shrimp with a lot of rice and curry sauce.  A smallish piece of donkatsu with a lot of rice and curry sauce.  No side dishes, veggies, nothing.  At $9.50 per, I was expecting Wako size I guess.  I force myself to recall that Curry House was $15, and this is not a bad deal.  A bite of the shrimp with rice on curry sauce and I'm convinced this is a good deal.  Perfectly fried shrimp and pork with perfectly cooked rice smothered in the BEST curry sauce ever.  And 20 minutes after I've completely forgotten how small the meats were, I am full and fully satisfied.  One word of warning:  they have spicy scale of 1-10, and they recommend a 3 for those who like spicy food.  I would heed those recommendations!  So after a beer, bottle of water, appetizer and two main dishes, we get a bill for under $27.  Okay, this is a great deal.  We're coming back here over and over.  But in between, we'll have to resist the temptation and also try Raku, Kabuto, Monta, Nakamura-Ya, and Big Wong's.  Maybe Chung Gi Wa too.  Table-for-1 Factor:  There is a bar with half-dozen or so seats, behind which is where the cooking happens.  I think it's perfect for eating solo.",

    "text": "This is as close as you will get to Japanese Curry in Las Vegas.  It's good tasting, and a good value, but it's nowhere near the taste or quality I experienced in Japan.  My son, whom was stationed in the Navy in Japan, did like it, and my other son, who accompanied me to Japan, said it was okay, but agreed with me that it was nowhere as good as what we ate in Japan.  Place is decent, help is very friendly, and as I said before, food is decent and certainly a very fair price.   My only complaint was; it's a busy center and parking is at a premium.   I might go back there for a light dinner, but I doubt I will get addicted to this place.",

    "text": "Good meals for a good price. Service is good minus a couple errors I had. Atmosphere is small and can get loud easily. Seating is limited in a small area.  The curry is good, but I usually get a level 1 dish. The spicy levels seems like they differ. Sometimes a level 1 will feel like level 1, but sometimes feels like level 3 or 4. Portions are filling as well.  Service is good, minus a couple bad experiences. One time I asked for a croquette as a side like always (I never had japanese curry without a croquette. EVER.) And the waiter asked \"croquette? Coke?\" I replied \"no, croquette\" and pointed at the croquette on the menu we then extended the whole croquette/ coke thing for 30 seconds more and reached an agreement of croquette. He then came back with a coke. I sent it back and got my croquette. Another time some waiter was being extremely cool and hip with it. He got my order wrong a few times, but im sure he was just having an unlucky time with me since the other people there didnt have any problems it seemed.  Environment is puny and if its full, youre probably gonna have to wait outside until one is available. It also gets loud easily with such dense seating.  Pros: good place to grab curry, carry (or curry lmao im killin myself here) out is available, nice portions.  Cons: seating is limited, gets loud easily, and inconsistent spicy levels  Advice: if seating is limited, you can get carry out. Top this place off with Kung Fu Tea, its perfect. Get croquettes as a side.",

Who knew that Japanese curry could be so scrumptious and spicy.  My boyfriend jokes about how he tried a level 8 before and couldn't even touch the food, but a level 3 was perfect and for comparison, it would be about a level 7-8 on a regular scale of hotness.  Anyways, can't wait to come back to Vegas and indulge.  GO try this place if you're in town!",

Pros: Solid curry, tasty, mom & pop feel  Cons: Very small venue, seats 15 people total maybe  This is a quaint place, very small though so if you aren't lucky enough to get here when its empty, then you'll expect to wait a while. The menu is very simple, easy to decide among a few dishes. They do curry and just curry and it's done well. Not amazing but very tasty. If you get a level 5 spice, that's just above comfortable for some of us who love spicy. Just a warning.  But there are essentially two tables for groups of 8, and a long \"curry bar\" that will seat another 8. So keep this in mind.  If you want to eat off strip and want comfort food, this is a great place to be.",

I was thinking...\"This iZENt happening...again!?!? Where do we go??? Sora? Big Wong? Raku? Monta? Then it hit me.....how about ZEN???? Yeah! J-Curry sounded like a great  plan B!!!  We were all in agreement and met up there...Now its usually always packed inside with less then a few doZEN tables, but when we peeked inside, I thought I was loZEN my mind....Not a single person inside!?!?! Great for us! We were greeted by who I assume was Mr. ZENbayashi and immediately got seated towards the back. To make sure we didn't miss out on any items, I made sure to ask our waiter right off the bat if they had some Curry Udon off the menu, and he later confirmed that it waZENt available.   I kept it simple this time and went with the Chicken Katsu Curry and  added cheese and corn. Combined with the complimentary toppings on the table, this made for another amaZEN meal with great friends.

I've also tried the 3 piece Kushikatsu (Deep fried zucchini, quail egg, and chicken skewer). I didn't enjoy the kushikatsu as much unfortunately so I probably won't get it again - mostly because the chicken was pretty tough and chewy and it was a lot of quail egg for me to finish lol.

What's on there is all the spices they use and what they are all about. I just sat down and just this info alone I am better for it because I just found out more info on the usual everyday spices I use on my food.  Their menu is pretty simple. Pick your meat whether its Pork, Chicken, Beef, Sausage, etc. You receive your picked meat covered with their special curry they make from scratch along with white rice. I  couldn't make up mind so I chose the Beef but added Pork Cutlet and a Croquette.   I shared this wonderful creation with my wifey and we were both impressed. The Pork was juicy and not dry at all. The Beef was soft and tender. As for the Croqette, I have never had it before so I don't really know how to describe it. It's basically a mashed potato cake with some vegetables in it.   Service was spot on with everything from our order being correctly taken to refills to receiving our check and payment promptly being handled. This was one tip I didn't mind adding extra with the standard.   Overall, just about everything was perfect except for the size of their place. It is pretty small and on really busy nights, you just might have to wait a bit. Oh well, you know what they say, sometimes good things come in small packages and this is one of them.",

Medium spicy was about perfect for me, giving a nice kick but not causing you to sweat your face off.   The only negative about this place is that it's located somewhat far away from the strip where most people spend their time and stay in hotels. But this review is about the food and service, both of which are excellent.",

    "text": "I'm never really a big fan of going out for Japanese curry because it's something that is so cheap and easy to make at home, so my review might be a little harsh. My friend on the other hand is a Japanese curry fanatic and would eat it every day if he could which is why we ended up here. We stopped by this place as we were leaving Las Vegas as just a quick meal before a long drive home. It was relatively empty since we got there not long after they opened. Since there were 4 of us, we decided to each try something different. We started off with 2 appetizers: takoyaki (4/5) and shu mai (1/5). For mains, I got the kushi curry with a croquette (3/5). My friends got the chicken katsu curry (2/5), karage curry (2/5), and pork medallion curry (2/5). You pay a base price for the curry + the meat, but if you want it spicier you add money on depending on the spice level you choose. Considering their prices were already relatively high, I wasn't so keen on the idea of adding more money just for a spicier dish. The takoyaki was very fresh and probably the best thing I had over lunch. The shu mai on the other hand was sad and over fried and definitely not worth the price. All the meat in the curries were super dry and tough. My friend who ordered the pork medallions was surprised at how dried out his pork was considering he ordered medallions in hopes that they would be much more juicy and tender than just a regular pork katsu. Even the karage and chicken were dry. The best curry was by far the kushi, since it came with a variety of things (my personal favorite being the quail eggs), but it definitely was not worth the price in my opinion. Not only did I get less portion wise, but the kushi curry was $2 more than the katsu curries. Definitely would not return here next time around.   Pros:  - Takoyaki was very fresh  - Offer a generous amount of curry sauce - Large interior with a good number of tables  Cons: - Hard to find parking - Meats were all dried out (especially sad considering they are fried) - Prices are way more than I'm willing to pay for something I could make at home for $5 or less",

Usually stick to the pork Katsu curry with a side of steamed vegetables.  The aroma of curry as you enter is quite pungent and gets your appetite going even more.  The pork tender katsu curry is very good but I tend to just gravitate back to the standard katsu curry.  The appetizers are good to try family style especially if you order a curry entree.  Recommendations include the breaded oysters, shumai and gyoza.  These aren't gourmet appetizers per say but they are quite tasty in their own rights.  The owner spends his time in the kitchen preparing dishes so you know you're in good hands during every meal here.  I've seen some people eating the curry udon and would like to try it sometime soon.",

My boyfriend has been to this place once before so he pretty much knew right off the bat what he wanted. I stuck to what I knew which was chicken katsu. They have a spice level scale on the bottom right hand of their menu. I can handle a little heat, but not too much - with that being said, I went with a level 3.  I can not be more thankful that I did. A level 3 was just perfect for me and my \"heat\" palate. It gave my meal a good kick without causing a waterfall dispensing from my nose. I do have to add though that a level 3 here is a lot more spicier than a level 3 in most Thai restaurants that I've ate at. In addition to our meals, we ordered tako yaki. It's good for what it is (octopus balls), but I probably wouldn't order it again since I'm not really a fan of octopus.  If you're a fan of curry, consider this place. It's small, quaint, and the chefs pack a hell of a punch when it comes to spices in your meals.",

I went with the Spinach Curry on the Specials board ($7) to keep my dinner light, but ended up getting enough food to take some home!   I really enjoyed the extra curry spices put on the table that allow you to either change or accentuate the spiciness of your meal. Pickled ginger and onions added crunch and an acidic sweetness that made my affordable dinner an experience of flavors.   Service was top-notch, and drinks/alcohol are super affordable.

I usually get a 1 just because it already gets spicy after a couple bites. I also order their tako yaki which is to die for if you love tako. Also when we eat the curry, don't forget to ask for the red pickles, it somewhat toned down the spiciness. Great customer service as well.",

Inside the restaurant is really small and calm, which can be desirable or undesirable, depending on the person I guess, but I don't really see it as a negative thing.   The curry itself is very tasty. When you order, I recommend getting the chicken or pork cutlet. You can even order an extra side of meat or anything else with it because they give you ample curry for another piece of meat! They even have different spices and condiments on the table for you to add to your curry so your curry won't ever be boring!  The owner always says hello and talks to customers when it isn't busy and asks if you are enjoying the food. That little bit of effort he puts to make sure everything is okay goes a long way.",

When I first came to Curry Zen when it first opened it was super small and only seated a max of maybe 15 people.  They've expanded it since then.  My usual plate it the chicken tender curry original spice WITH a croquette.  The flavors are wonderful and it has a light kick to it but of course you can pick a spicier level.  Sometimes I get the chicken katsu curry but since it has more fat and I'm trying to be more \"health conscious\" (lol) I stick with the chicken tenders.    I think a must topping to have with curry is cheese, almonds, and raisins.  Traditional and non traditional toppings but still makes it delicious.  I've ordered the fried oysters a couple times, it's good but you can see and taste the oil its fried in so I try to stray away from eating all 3.",

My group saw this plaza nearby and decided to check it out.  Checking Yelp, Japanese Curry Zen had very high ratings (highest in the plaza) so it must be good and decided to check it out.  When I first went in, a larger group was eating inside and noticed the only seating spots available were at the counter.  I was greeted with the \"irashaimasae!\" (welcome in Japanese) and was very pleasant to hear.  I ordered the tender pork katsu with a spice rating of 3 which was medium spice.  My wife ordered 5 and it was a little on the spicy side.  Generally if you are novices to curry, I would recommend a 2.  The tender pork was indeed tender and cooked very well.  The curry had a thickness to it and wasn't watered down like some places... it had a good spice kick to it and hands down was one of the best curry I ever had.  Their prices were reasonable and the owner is very friendly and was very humble.  He did mention that they are expanding the restaurant to the now vacant spot next door, so come January/February they will have more seating capacity.  If you are in need of some awesome Japanese curry or something different than the average Vegas Strip restaurant, check this place out!",

    "text": "Let me tell you; The curry here is absolutely DELICIOUS. I'm fairly picky with curry, and so far out of my choices here in vegas, this one's at the top of my list!  The service is good and friendly. It was my coworkers first time eating japanese curry and she wasn't too sure about her spice level she chose, so the server offered to adjust it for her if she wasn't satisfied! (I like spicy but even level 4 is too spicy for me! I was sniffling the whole time!)  The chicken katsu/tenders and beef is soooo good. As we say in hawaii: onolicious brah! The flavor is much more authentic compared to other places I've tried. The katsu tofu and veggies are a good add on as well. The portions are generous so I usually have some leftovers to take home for my next meal ^_^  The only reason I didn't this place 5 stars is because the prices are more on the expensive side.  Otherwise it's really good and I definitely recommend this place :)",

    "text": "Love Japanese Curry. While in Vegas for a solar convention, I thought to check and see if there was any here. I drove out to Japanese Curry Zen and loved the ambiance (on a Sunday night too!). Parking was tough in the parking lot for this strip mall of about 15 Asian restaurants at 5020 Spring Mountain - but I parked on street and walked in which was about an extra 60 feet. Got a table as soon as I walked in although the place was very crowded and folks seemed to be waiting outside. The whole strip mall center was high energy and fun. I ordered the chicken cutlet curry with the seasoning on the spicy side at 7 out of 10. They let you pick your spice level. 7 was pretty edgy. Food was great and service was great too. Manager Utah is fairly young with diligence to spare. Many restaurants I wander into have half as much respect for the clientele. Utah personally attended my table in addition to the waitress - who was a great server on her own. This manager Utah was all over the place but his staff were on it. I loved it so much I then ordered a pork cutlet at spice level 4. The spice level difference was substantial -very mild like I'd hoped for. Japanese Curry Zen is wonderful food and has great service and prices are about $8-10 a plate. Liked it so much, I bought a shirt for $10.",

I went with their dish that did not have curry. I can't recall the name right now but it was a pork katsu bowl with rice, eggs, seaweed and ginger. I loved the ginger in the bowl. Barely any seaweed. And the scrambled egg, was somewhere in between cooked and not cooked. No complaints from me though, I thought at first I can dig this.   Then I had to dig out a piece of a hair that was embedded in my pork katsu. It was mixed in with the batter surrounding the pork and it never seemed to end. I didn't complain. I just pushed my bowl to the side and ate no more.  Overall, I left feeling disgusted and sad. Even with the hair experience, me and my coworker said we would return but only to try to the Curry. I am not just not sure how fast that is going to happen for me.",

Needing some sweetness after the heat, I ordered their mango cheesecake after finding out the green tea cheesecake was all out. The cheesecake was somewhat dry, lacking the creaminess of better versions. Japanese restaurants aren't typically known for their desserts, so I'd pass next time but would recommend the katsu, especially if you enjoy a bit of spiciness to your curry.",

    "text": "OHHH YESS. Give me ALL of the curry. This place has our hearts and is one of our fall-back restauraunts anytime we need some delicious food and wouldn't mind a bit of heat. We have come 3 or 4 times and have had a great experience each time.   Beware, their curry truly is HOT. I can only tolerate a 3-4 out of 10 and I'm no wimp. The heat builds the more that you eat so that by the end of the dish, you have to take a few gulps of water after every bite. The pickled vegetables on the side help with the heat, as does added cheese and corn, but nothing will help you if you order a level 10 heat. Nothing... Your insides will be your outsides and I pity the fool that plays like that!  Anyway, if you're a pro with hot curries, I would go with a level 6 or 7 and work from there. They have shakers on the side with curry powder and chile powder to add.   I personally recommend their croquette as it is so fluffy and crispy and delightful, no regrets. If you are a vegetarian or avoid meat, their tofu katsu is perfectly crisp and tastes great with the dark sauce in the squeeze bottles at the table.   I always get the 16 grain curry because I really love the varying texture of the rice. My boyfriend is a fan of the plain white rice with his curry. He normally gets the pork katsu but has tried the Japanese meatloaf before. He wasn't the hugest fan of it but he did like it, just not as much as the pork! ^_^  Overall, you could go to Curry Zen every day of the week and try something new, with amazing service each time to boot! This is definitely one of my favorite places for food on Spring Mountain and I think anyone that likes curry will love Curry Zen :D",

I can handle heat and it was perfect for me. Choose your meat and add your sides. I was surprised they didn't serve gyoza and didn't have the meat combinations set up together but you can just add it on if you want. If you haven't had curry it's like spiced gravy but thicker. Very delicious and comforting. You can also choose white or brown rice which is a nice option. This parking lot gets packed so if you can't find a spot park on the street next to the parking lot and walk over not a long walk but this place gets packed since Monta, Raku and Kung du tea are just some of the places with heavy traffic. Thinking of curry is making me crave some. Good thing we keep it stocked in my house. Probably gonna make some now ;)",

No it's clearly not for the health guru, but it's definitely for the hearty! Their spice level is from 1-10. I was a little worried so I went for level 4, but I wish I went atleast to 7.

When I came here, I actually wasn't sure what my expectations were because I know so many people who absolutely love this place, yet I wasn't sure how convinced I was since I'm not exactly a curry enthusiast.   However, here I am, thinking about how much I want to eat it again every day since I went (about 4 days ago).   I ordered a standard chicken katsu curry spice level 3. It was the perfect level of spice for me and I enjoy spicy food. No toppings were added besides the house picked radish.   The katsu itself was delicious and had the perfect crunch. The curry was flavorful and warmed by body and the radish added a nice crunch. The meal overall just felt like comfort food. Even though I know it's part of the aesthetic, my only complaint is that I wish the curry wasn't layered over part of the katsu. I like the crunch of the katsu and layering the curry over it makes it soggy. But that's just a personal preference, like I don't really enjoy nachos because I dislike the sogginess. I'm more of a dipping type of person haha.   Service was super friendly and food came out quick. Now I understand what the hype was all about!",

I did find the prices to be a bit steep especially since you'll be adding at least one protein option and one topping to any curry order.   The *Zen Curry* I ordered with pork katsu and a fried egg did end up being ~$12. Yes, they do charge 20 cents for every level of spicyness. I happened to select a Level 1 since the waiter did inform me that even a Level 0 would have *some* chili powder added. However, the 1 actually was pretty mild even for someone as intolerant to spice such as myself. The sauce was creamy, rich, and aromatic. Rice was fluffy and the chopped cutlet pieces were juicy and crunchy. I may have complained about the pricing, but you do get A LOT, not just of rice and sauce, but the protein serving was rather large too. I also ordered Takoyaki; I want to say there were six decently sized balls with an even more decently sized dicing of octopus on the inside. These were definitely cooked in a griddle -- there was some crunch on the outside and it was a bit soft and only slightly runny on the inside. Traditional takoyaki is very runny and soupy, so they seemed to have catered a bit to American palate by keeping things mostly firm. I certainly wasn't a fan of traditional takoyaki and I guess I prefer it more solid. Someday, I'll develop a liking for the soupy, traditional kind.",

    "text": "I've been going to Curry Zen for several years now. It's a great place to get delicious curry.  You choose a base ingredient for your curry and then, you can add extra toppings if you like. You also choose the level of spiciness; I usually get Zero Spicy Level since I'm weak against spiciness.  I normally order a Scrambled Egg & Spinach Curry with a Croquette, but last time I went, I ordered a Croquette Curry with Scrambled Eggs and Cheese. Tomato comes with the Scrambled Eggs. They also have other food such as Curry Udon, Naan Bread, and etc. I really enjoy their Takoyaki~ The Takoyaki has a nice crunchy, but soft texture.  You can also choose to order a half curry plate which are smaller than the normal plate at Curry Zen. It's in the same area as Monta, Kungfu Tea, Hwaro, and Sweet Raku.",

    "text": "Chinatown is known to have a lot more than just Chinese cuisine -- Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and so on. And sometimes, even those have different types of food depending on what you're in the mood for! Curry Zen is an example of such a place, focusing specifically on the Japanese comfort food of curry rice. It's a simple dish of curry and rice, but the number of toppings you can choose means you can customize it to be your own! This is another one of my personal favorite places for food in Chinatown.  Whenever I come in, I typically order a large plate of curry rice and an appetizer -- in this case, the mix fry, which is fried shrimp, chicken skewer, croquette and tofu with a salad and a honey mustard sauce. For me, this is the perfect plate to prime my stomach for the curry to come.  And is it a good plate! The curry comes as a rich sauce plated with a snowy mound of rice -- and you can add what you want or make it as spicy as you want! I usually stick with 2 because you can taste the spices and their afterburn even at such a low level. For me, I usually add a lot of toppings for a satisfying meal -- for this review, I went with pork tenderloin, cheese, boiled chicken and shrimp. And I don't regret it -- you just can't stop eating this curry! Adding the pickled red ginger as a side also provides tart refreshment from the savory curry sauce.  It's been seven years since Curry Zen established itself here in Chinatown, and their flavor is one of the many reasons why I and other repeat customers love to come out here for its comforting flavor. A warm hug compared to the typically chilly sushi we think of with Japanese cuisine, if you want something different come here to Curry Zen! You won't regret it.",

Best thing was the price, very reasonable for the portions, and their wide selection on their menu -many kinds of proteins to add to your curry and a large selection of appetizers/side dishes.  I ordered the katsu curry and shared an appetizer of takoyaki.   The waitress kindly pointed out that their \"heat scale\" is skewed towards the hotter side, so a 4/10 actually had a decent kick to it. I like things hot, but more mild than my husband. So, I'd get a 3 next time. For reference usually order the \"original hot\" wings at Wing Stop (though they're a bit milder than my limit). My husband likes things decently spicy, and would have chosen a 5/10 here. (He likes the atomic hot at wing stop).  We had to specifically ask to get the pickled radish that I'd normally expect to come standard with curry. And the sauce was not as tangy (sweet/sour) as I personally enjoy. This is why I wouldn't give them a higher score.",

The owner used to man the kitchen and you can tell that he was very passionate about what he does. It shows in how good the food is here. My go-to here is the chicken katsu. I like to change up my extra toppings. Sometimes I get it with spinach, sometimes scrambled eggs, sometime cheese; depending on how I'm feeling. I always eat my curry with the pickled ginger and Japanese shallots. It adds an extra crunch to the food. Food is definitely five stars. Service used to be better. As a person who used to be a server, it irks me to see people waiting at the front door without getting greeted. I watched one of the servers walk past and ignore the person maybe 5 times and eventually walks behind him to reach for the waitlist, STILL, without acknowledging his presence. I understand it's busy but at least acknowledge the waiting guest and let them know you'll assist them later. Also it took a couple asks to get the pickled sides too. Oh well! Hopefully service improves! I'll definitively keep coming back here because it's still one of my favorite spots to eat at.   Service needs improvement.",

It is a blessing and a curse that I hate the parking situation of the plaza it's in or else I would be eating here far too often. The parking lot has the potential of being a pain based on the hour of the day; however, the food here is definitely worth.  It's a cozy, small restaurant. There have been times when there's a wait; however, the maximum time that I've waited was fifteen minutes and a majority of the time, we were seated immediately. Please note that every time that I've been here, it was for lunch. The service is always super friendly and fast!  I can't lie and say that I've tried and loved everything on the menu simply because I order the same thing every single time - chicken katsu curry with the spice level at three. The portion is fair and fills me up about halfway through the meal. The chicken is crispy and goes so, so well with the curry sauce and rice. You can pick and choose your toppings with their popular ones being corn and cheese, but I love a fried egg on top!   I would definitely give this place a try whether you're an avid curry lover or it's something that you've never had!",

Service was good, my table had just enough service which is always nice. The Curry quality was so good. I got a spicy level 3 and it was perfect. They had my usual curry order which is beef curry with cheese, a hint of spice. So that was super exciting as I haven't had curry at a curry restaurant in foreverrrrrrr. If you want some more spice they have the spicy pepper to give that extra heat. They also had appetizers too which I got to try the takoyaki and chicken karage. Both super good with flavor.

    "text": "I once tried Curry Zen (when it first opened) and was thoroughly unimpressed. So unimpressed that I forgot I had been here already! This is no surprise because I'm notoriously anti-fried food and need greens with every meal. However, after visiting Japan this summer I am all about the curry and kushiage life now.  SERVICE & LOCATION Quick and friendly service, as with any respectable Japanese curry place. I would be annoyed if they were fancy and asked me about my day! Just tryin' to shovel some spice level 5 in without small talk. The venue itself is pretty plain and unassuming, and a tad bit cramped. Being located in one of the busiest plazas in Vegas makes parking a headache during peak hours.  FOOD Ahh, the star of the show is of course their curry. Fragrant, filling, and can be made to an obnoxiously spicy level. (They charge you above level 2, I think). You can customize it with toppings or choose from premade sets. I personally like vegetable curry with potato croquette! (I heard you liked carbs, so we took carbs, wrapped it in carbs... deep fried!)  Chicken kushiage is kind of dry but the zucchini is delicious. Oh, and the side salad is somehow super addicting.   This place is perfect if you're really hungry (huge portions). If you have a small appetite, like my mother, you can totally split a plate with some other weenie.",

    "text": "Curry house serving up some amazing curry with spice adjustments and bunch of topping options from chicken katsu to meat loaf. Located in the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen and Kung Fu Tea.   SERVICE Every worker I have encountered have been polite and attentive. Quick to refill water, get your order and checks. Customer service here is on point everytime.   FOOD I grew up eating curry. Back when I was living in Japan, I remember I always looked forward to my school lunch every Friday because it was curry rice. I looked forward to it so bad I couldn't even pay attention in class. 1+1=curry? Makes sense.    Keep in mind, curry is one of those things where everyone makes it differently and each household has different style of curry. Japanese curry has evolved in many ways because people are constantly trying to figure out ways to make it taste better- adding chocolate or coffee in curry is typical in many Japanese households.   All of that somewhat irrelevant information aside, it's difficult to rate a curry for me because I am accustomed to my family's homemade curry. I do have to say the curry here is good in its own way. I know Mr. Zenbayashi takes pride in his curry and I enjoy the curry here, with spicy level 0 because I can't handle any spicyness. I also like mine with chicken katsu and cheese. Don't go too crazy on the spicy level as some find level 2 to be pretty spicy. There's also extra charge if you go past 6 on the spice scale.   I appreciate that they offer many options. You can get your curry with brown rice, white rice or udon. They also offer chicken katsu, pork katsu, meat loaf, kurobuta sausage, cheese, corn, croquette, fried shrimp etc. (Anywhere from $.50 to $3.00 to add-on). Customize your way!  CONCLUSION The portion is somewhat small but for the price range of $10-12, their rich and thick curry with crispy and perfectly fried katsu is well worth it.",

I really enjoyed the flavours much more than Thai curry. The curry itself had nice spices and the cheese complemented it well. The level 10 was a little spicy, but I could definitely use a bit more kick. The chicken katsu looked amazing and tasted much like how it looked. The croquette was merely ok to me, so I'll probably skip that next time.   Service was quick and my water never got more than half empty. Prices were fair, I think it was just under $25 for my friend and I. I'll definitely be back the next time I get a curry craving.",

    "text": "Japanese Curry Zen is a curry house in the China town area that offers a delicious base curry served with your choice of meat, spice level, and sides! I've only tried one other curry house in Las Vegas and they have my favorite sauce here. Saying this curry is like the store boat curry would be like saying the ramen you buy at a grocery store is like Monta.  They serve white and brown rice with many different proteins to go with your curry & rice like katsu'd pork/chicken, spam, sausage, meat loaf, croquettes, beef, and grilled chicken. Some other add ons are cheese, corn, and veggies. They also have some sides like fried oysters, gyoza, and curry puffs.  I got the chicken katsu curry and added veggies, corn, and cheese. I'm a sucker for a Japanese meat patty so I got one of those on the side too. Be careful because all of the sides can add up! My dinner wound up being about $18 with a water lol.  The food was delicious! Both proteins I got were cooked very well. The katsu chicken was moist on the inside & the Japanese meatloaf was flavorful and delicious. The cheese  I got added a creaminess that made the dish for me. I've never had cheese on my curry but will probably always get it that way in the future.  My one gripe would be my assumption that a 5 on their spice level would be medium. It was HOT. I would have enjoyed my dinner more had I got a lower spice level. I did try my friends 1 spice and it was a bit sweet for me so I'm sure a 3 would be solid.  The service was good. It was sweet of them to happily split our bill even though it was super busy.   I'll definitely be back but I'll tone it down on the add-ons and get a lower spice level.",

I ordered chicken katsu with the lowest level of spice. The chicken was really good and the curry wasn't spicy! I definitely could have done a couple levels higher, so if you don't like spice get level one. I also tried some of my boyfriends tofu katsu which was good as well. I usually have tofu with peanut sauce, but the tofu katsu went well with curry!  The service was great! They were very attentive and checked on us often.

Everything that I love about a restaurant is here and aligns perfectly like a balance of the universe. I swear, the stars align when I visit this place!  - I love how the place is so small and cozy; the capacity is only 18 people.  - The prices are very affordable with the base price starting at $4.95. - The menu is simple and easy to breeze through - You can customize your curry: toppings? spiciness? brown rice? They got it! - The food is delicious, fresh and doesn't weigh a person down. It's pretty healthy too, so that feeling of \"I ate pretty good,\" resonates through my head instead of, \" I can't believe I ate _that_. I think I'll go hibernate now.\"  Finally, the owner and his staff are some of the nicest most appreciative people that I have met. I have been here 4 times now and the gentleman behind the counter (I believe he's the owner) always takes the time to greet guests entering the restaurant as well as thanking them as they exit. If you're up at the bar eating, he'll most likely ask you personally how everything was. The rest of the staff are warm and attentive too. This really hits it home for me because it shows that the owner really cares about his restaurant and the customers.  Curry Zen gets 5 stars from me because I honestly can't get enough of it. Whether it's the next day, whether I'm on the other side of town, or whether it's four in the morning, it always sounds good. My boyfriend is also a big fan and jokes that they must put crack in it ;)  So if the line at Monta is a little long, try swinging by this little gem and giving it a go. You might find your Zen here ^_^",

Now, the flavor is pretty spot on to our favorite curry joint in NY, only suggestion for Zen curry would be to add a little shredded cabbage to the plate.

I was actually planing to eat at Big Wong when I looked across the parking lot and saw the new place with a grand opening sign so I decided to try it. The place was packed! All the tables were taken,(all 2 of them) yes is a small place and you may have to wait outside for your table, so I sat at the bar which I didn't mind because you can see everything that's going on on the kitchen. (Cooks making curry) I ordered the shrimp curry, And even though I'm not a real fan of any curry since the strong taste/flavors seem to revisit me all through the day, like a meal that keeps on giving, but the flavors of this curry weren't too overpowering, just enough to create that indescribable and addictive flavor. The curry is made with more than ten ingredients that the menu claims that every spice or condiment used for this curry contains some holistic health benefit. (Almost as good as snake oil) So you know that every bite is good for your health on top of being good for your taste buds which is actually what counts at the end.      I also had the small salad  which it was crisp and flavorful and at the end of the meal the coffee jello dessert which it was good, again, not too sweet but sweet enough to call it dessert. Can't wait to try the one other dessert.  I left that place feeling good and healthy. Service was great and place was spotless, I guess it had to do with being the grand opening, but I'm pretty sure service will continue to be that way, the place is too small to miss you, you can literally grab your waiter from where you're sitting anytime you need something.  So if you happen to be in the area close to this shopping center that's quickly becoming little Japan, stop and visit this new member of the family, after all we all need a little zen in our lives.                                                                                                    ........or curry.",

    "text": "I just went to their pre-opening and I loved it! I can't wait to take my husband because I know he will love it, too!  Their curry  reminds me of  a famous Japanese curry chain called CoCo Ichiban, which is my favorite curry restaurant in Japan.  I had chicken katsu (chicken cutlet) curry, which was always my favorite at CoCo.  Their secret curry sauce is prepared from scratch, and I was so impressed that theirs was as good as CoCo's! I had been missing this so much!  Along with basic curry,  you can add toppings of your choice from chicken cutlet, pork cutlet, deep fried shrimp, croquette, yakiniku beef, sausage and more. I always like chicken katsu on my curry, but other people were saying pork katsu was good, too. I think the spice level is about 4 out of 10, not too spicy, not too mild, but you can add more spice if you like.  The price was reasonable. Curry with 1 or 2 toppings(which I think is enough), is less than $10. Sometimes Japanese portions are too small, but theirs was big enough and I felt very satisfied after the meal.   If you're missing real Japanese curry, or if you 're disappointed with others, this is the one you should try!",

The restaurant itself is small but very cozy. Got the pork cutlet with croquette. Both were done very well and the curry tasted delicious too. total came to around $11-12 which I guess is reasonable. I actually kinda wished the curry came with some vegetables already in it because just the sauce seems kind of... too simple for me. I guess for its price, I expected more. Overall, service was excellent and I'm actaully hoping they will add more variety to the menu.",

We were all greeted in Japanese and we were all seated at the counter seats. Luckily there were seats for all 6 of us because people had to wait to get seated because the place is pretty small.  The waiter was a super nice dude; his name was Yuta or something? Anyways, he had such a happy tone and he was really kind. The chef himself was a very nice man. I was surprised he was the only cook, but he had someone in the back preparing the rice and the plates.   The inside of the place is pretty nice despite it being small. Apparently they changed the menu design and it looks way better now, but I've never seen the old one so whatevs. The counter had a plethora of lucky cat decorations and other cute Asian stuff. I couldn't stop staring at the Asian cat that's swaying back and forth with bells in its hand, yeahhh I get distracted easily.   I ordered the chicken katsu and I switched it to brown rice instead of white and it was not even a problem. Needless to say, it was some damn good curry. Add some of the spices and condiments to it too, it became even more damn good. I wasn't feeling like eating curry too before I got my plate, but once I tasted all the exotic spices I added with the raisins, almonds, and the other stuff, man I was sad when the plate was cleaned.   The only bad thing that happened was me dropping my spoon into the plate of curry twice. Other then that, I'm going to be getting some more curry, some Zen curry.",

    "text": "Curry Zen is the newest Japanese restaurant addition to Seoul Plaza, but makes me wonder when its going to be changed to Reikon Plaza? You know Reikon meaning soul or spirit in Japanese... ah nevermind, terrible joke.   I have visited a few times now since they've opened and noticed each time the curry increases in spice slightly as well as the amount of condiments on the counter. Now they have raisins, sliced almonds, 3 different mixed spices (mild, medium, and hot of course), fukujinzuke (mixed pickled vegetables), and pickled scallions.   The menu is small ranging from chicken katsu, pork katsu, kurobata sausages, potato croquette, shrimp, a curry hot dog, and a couple of jello desserts Maybe its not their style, but if somewhere down the line they decide to add vegetables as toppings I would be all for it!  The best things about Curry Zen is the portions are good versus price (yay for college budgets), FREE brown rice option (paging brown rice warlord Misti Y), service is friendly, and I suppose that its an option for my vegetation eating friends as you can opt for the curry and a croquette.   Lastly the only con I can think of now is... where am I going to park? With  all these thriving businesses in this plaza it makes parking a chore.   A side note of the most nanoscopic size possible, I did see someone wheel in a few boxes with labels saying Java Curry. I'm not suggesting that it is not homemade, but I do wonder if they use their roux some parts of their curry? Just some thoughts from a noobs.   100th, yippee.",

But, the plus side is you can order a small portion of rice and order a bunch of add-ins, like croquette, veggies, egg, etc.  The flavor of the curry was rich and flavorful.  One each table, you can choose the level of spiciness you want, mild, hot, and extra hot by sprinking their custom peppers.  Go with the extra HOT!  As a side note, the restaurant is really small, with only a handful of tables and a counter with 6 or so seats.  Altogether, it did the job and we left satisfied.",

My favorite dishes are pork cutlet, fried shrimp and hot dog curry. You can chose white rice or brown rice to go with it. I love the crispy textures of breading of pork cutlet and fried shrimps. Pork cutlet is always juicy and never overdone. I feel fortune that they even have Japanese hot dogs on menu. This small shop is very clean and opens late. Service here is fast and efficient. It can definitely be a quick eat spot if you are in a rush.",

    "text": "Small store located in the same plaza as Monta Ramen and Big Wong Resturant.   I've been meaning to come here as I've heard good things from friends and others and finally was able to come.   The overall atmosphere is very friendly with a welcoming staff. I liked the atmosphere a lot. There is a bar with maybe 10 or so seats and four tables I believe that seat four each.   I'm very particular about my Japanese Curry as I am with a lot of Japanese foods, but I try to keep an open mind.   They have many condiments on the table, three of them are different levels of spicy curry powder (mild, regular, spicy), ginger, almonds, raisins, and salt & pepper. The curry powder is their recipe with many blended spices that they make.   The prices are pretty reasonable, $4.95 for the plain curry and then depending on the topping you add additional costs. You can mix and match whatever you want on their menu ranging from chicken katsu to corn and other items you would \"normally\" find in curry.   I got the croquette (+$2) and corn (+$1) in my plain curry. I thought for the price the croquette would be slightly larger than what it came out as, so I was a little disappointed. They brought it out on a plate with the rice on one side and curry on the other, the croquette and corn in the middle, with an overlap of curry (Japanese don't like to \"mix\" the curry and rice traditionally). The croquette however was good and I believe they make it as well. It was nicely browned to the correct color and breaded perfectly.   The curry itself was mediocre, maybe I was expecting more, but I have to come back and try it again to make a real comparison. The spices were good, but it felt like something was lacking, maybe it was an unlucky batch that I got. I'll definitely come back to give it another try before making a final opinion on it.   It has an authentic taste to it, maybe the most authentic out of all the curry I've tried in Las Vegas, but like I said I would have to give this another try along with some others. Will update in the near future on the taste of the curry again. =]  Oh they didn't put the ginger on the plate (thankfully, as I don't like ginger).   I would definitely recommend at least giving it a try.",

I had the mini curry (cheaper and still decent portion size) with pork katsu. You could tell the katsu was freshly fried. They have the fujinikjumi (sp?), the crunchy pickled red daikon on the table so you can take as much as you want. I ate half of that little pot lol.   Curry udon was also good but barely had any meat so best bang for the buck would be a rice curry dish.   Only downside is the plaza is pretty tight on parking. Even at 10:30pm people are circling around trying to find parking.",

I got a two a second time, and it was nicely spicy but not overpowering.  There was a great selection of drinks including sodas, canned iced teas (green and oolong) and beer and wine.  The beer is affordable with domestics being real cheap and Japanese beers being about a buck more each.  This place is a great deal and fantastic for locals or tourists.

That was certainly enough to fill me up. The curry flavor was so full of flavor. I didn't add extra spice to it, and thankfully the curry wasn't spicy in the mouth at all. However, you can very well taste the herbs and spice in it. The croquette is certainly a recommendation. It has potato with vegetables inside, and it's fried.  Super yum. It has that nice outter crunch on the outside and a nice soft potato inside. I got to talk to the chef for a bit who was really friendly and helpful. He also recommended that I try mixing raisins and almonds in my rice. Apparently it's good for the digestive system. It's pretty good! However, I recommend you mix it with white rice. It doesn't taste as good with brown rice. The chicken was also very tender.   I'll definitely be back soon when I need to tend on my curry fix again!",

The venue is a little small but that is the only downside. parking lot can get kinda full but people are always coming and going so your bound to find a stall if your patient. If the restaurant itself is packed and your willing to wait you wont be disappointed on the quality, price or service of this place. So if you enjoy a good japanese curry and rice, get here!!!",

It will, however, delight you with a wonderful burst of flavors and simple authenticity. I'll definitely be back.",

Most of the proteins are fried.  My favorite was the shrimp but also had the sausage and the chicken and liked them all.  I added the vegatables to my plate because I was looking for a little nutrition.   I wouldn't get the vegatables again as they were of the most boring, bland (possibly frozen from a bag) variety that could be found.  Very friendly service.",

Our second visit happened around noon on a Friday. While we were driving here, I thought for sure it would be packed again. To my surprise, there were several open seats. I guess it was a great idea to come here on iPad Mini launch day!  As I mentioned, this place is very tiny. There are 18 seats available (yes, I actually counted, lol). Two tables that seats 4, one table that seats 2, and 8 seats at the bar. The menu is tiny as well, with only 6 toppings to choose from. I appreciate that they have brown rice and don't charge extra for it. Ordered my usual - Chicken Cutlet Curry. The curry was full of flavor and not too watery or salty. Portion size of the chicken cutlet was perfect and not too small.   Service was a bit slow. The place filled up eventually and there was only one server. We had to wait a while for our bill after our plates were taken away.   Simple menu, tasty, filling, and inexpensive. I'll be back for sure, but maybe for take-out since it is always crowded here. Hopefully they will open a second, bigger location in the future.   FYI - minimum credit card charge is $8.00.",

    "text": "Got a chance to finally check this place out a few weeks ago and I wasn't that impressed. Not really sure what all the hype is about. The curry here is decent, better than most places, but nothing to rave about.    Like most others diners, I ordered the curry katsu which runs about $10. Each add-on (corn, egg, carrots, etc) is an $1 extra so it can get pricey if you prefer toppings in the curry. The katsu which is perfectly golden and crispy is the main selling point here. The curry on the other hand is just basic. Its simply a water downed brown sauce which explains why they charge for the toppings on the side. They also charge extra if you want spice up the curry but I did notice that their level 3 is probably a level 7 or 8 at most other places. There isn't a whole lot that sets this place apart from the other Japanese curry spots in the area. Thankfully they do serve beer and wine which is always a plus.   The restaurant itself is a small eatery located across the from Sweets Raku in the heart of Chinatown. The plaza gets busy so finding parking can be a pain. Service wasn't an issue, though its pretty obvious that English isn't anyone's first language here. There is a limited menu beyond their curry options but katsu curry appears to be the best seller by far.",

The place is pretty small but you never feel crammed and I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes even when I've come with fairly large groups. I'm never not in the mood for their curry!  My one critique would be that the parking lot is always full and a bit difficult to navigate since it's really small. The food makes you forget about the headache of the parking lot though",

    "text": "I'm sorry. I like Zen for what it is and all, it is good, better than the other places I've tried in Vegas however it just seems too plain for me to be a fan of. Is it more that curry, rice, and fried stuff!?  The menu is simple you order what kind of curry you want (original, vegetable, or spinach), what level of spiciness (1-5 is free and 6-10 is $0.20 extra), what rice (plain or brown), and what fried stuff you want included (pork/chicken/tofu katsu, pork/chicken tender, shrimp, sausage, and a few others). I've always ordered the original curry with levels ranging from 5-10 depending on the mood, it is good, has the flavors I like but I can never get it too hot to my liking even with the additional spices on the table, sure I'll sweat but I want to breath fire. Maybe it's not suppose to be too hot!? And I'll get the plain rice. The plates are pretty much half rice and half curry. I like the kurobuta sausages but the fried stuff is standard. I could easily eat one plate and be still hungry but drink plenty of water if you're a big eater like me. Adding additional items is an option but it also means adding to the price, which could turn pricey.  The interior is nice and clean. It does get busy occasionally so you might have to wait for a seat or even maneuver around while walking through the establishment. I've never had a problem with service, food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and staff is usually friendly, refill drinks, and handles checks.   Ask for a smaller spoon or a fork cause the spoon they usually give you is huge.  Don't let this review turn you away from going here the food's not bad or anything and I'd probably go back as long as others wanna go but you wont hear me raving about it.",

Both are delicious. I've tried the fried spam as well, and how can you go wrong with fried spam?   I think the thing that makes this place special is the service. All of the servers are so sweet and attentive. If it becomes slow, they are genuinely sorry. There was one time when one of my friends didn't get his food while the rest of us did. The server was kind and offered my friend a free beer.  Overall, this place reminds me of my childhood and the service is the cherry on top!",

My main issue was the following: I ordered a beer and there was too much head ( someone doesn't know how to pour) my beer was half a glass by the time it settled which is a rip off. We also received our meals 5 mins apart which is super awkward. My friend got his plate... 5 mins later I got mine... 5 mins later my BF got his... So my bf had to wait ten minutes into us eating to join in.. I don't mind getting our meals one plate at a time but that's way too big of a gap.  I ordered a croquette level 7 curry and it was DELICIOUS! I had 0 problem with the food. I love spicy and level 7 was the perfect level for me.  I love the food and our waitress was nice but please work on whomever pours the beer to learn how to pour it correctly and have the food come out close to each other so it's not awkward. UPDATE*** Came back a second time and everything was awesome.  No complaints second time around. Went from 3 stars to 5 stars for me!!!",

If you're like me, a typical American guy who got tired of all the healthy fish &  veggies in Japan, you've fallen in love with Japanese curry and the seemingly random assortment of available toppings. This place reminds me of the better curry shops in Japan, albeit without a ticket vending machine in front...   Although I really wanted to try the spam katsu curry, I stuck with my traditional pork katsu & cheese curry. And the shaved almonds as a crunchy topping were fantastic.   If you were right by my house, Japanese Curry Zen, I would need to move, because I'd probably eat there every day and gain 15 pounds the first month. Thank you,  though, for only being 15 minutes from home.",

    "text": "Running around Vegas gave us the late night munchies. We were so happy that this spot  was open late!    I drowsily shuffled myself into the brightly lit and chipper restaurant. I was hungry! The menu was very simple. It focuses on the homemade curry sauce and the katsu. For the small amount of food on the plate, the prices were kind of high. We ordered the pork katsu and curry and added a side of veggies to make the plate more substantial. Bummer that there isn't a veggie and meat combo curry because adding the veggie side really bumped up the price of our dish. I'm used to Chinatown prices where you can get a substantial meal for $12. This was more of a snack for that price.   My favorite part of the visit were the delicious bright pink, free pickles that sat on the table. The jar was full when our party of 3 arrived but when we left it was only 1/4 full. Noms.",

Only 4 stars bc the husband says he can taste the sweetness/artificial ness and it's not the best curry he's had. But I loved it!  We wanted to get off the strip for some good Asian food and since husband was craving curry, we found this little gem. He got the Japanese meatball and I got pork katsu. I enjoyed it very much. Katsu was on point, curry was yummy. Spicyness was a bit too much but that's my fault for wanting 6/10.

The curry was yummy - I had the pork tonkatsu curry with white rice, potato croquettes and topped with shredded cheese. The condiments provided to us were good. I loved the Rokkyo (pickled baby onion bulbs) and if you want your curry hot there were many condiments to do just that. There even were raisins and almonds -yucky to me but hey if it works for you.....  The Potato Croquette was near perfect - the texture,breading,the mashed potato - yeah it was all good.... the tonkatsu was fried well also. The curry sauce was good enough to me. I only enjoy Japanese and certain Thai curries so this place did hit the spot.  I did suggest to the waitress that other curry options should be offered like - curry cooked with veggies (carrots & potatoes), or curry with beef cooked in it (cause the beef becomes melt in your mouth soft) or even offer more add-ins like corn,green onions,ect.... Now, the waitress didn't really speak or understand english so I don't know if my suggestions made it to the cook.....  But, yeah I'll be back to get my Japanese Curry grub on!!!!",

Growing up, my mom's home made curry was always the best. I mean, who doesn't love 'mom's' cooking, right?  As unfortunate as it was, I moved to Vegas and the months grew to years; my taste bud fell short, unsatisfied by the curry palettes offered in Vegas. Almost everything was a hit or miss! It was either the curry sucked and the meat was perfect, or the other way around. Booo!  Any ways, long story short, I found this place off of yelp and it was a romantic story between my dish and I. Love at first sight. I couldn't keep myself away! Is it bad that I COULD EAT IT EVERYDAY!? NO PUN INTENDED. LOL.  Meat ever so tender, various side options to satisfy the texture cravings, and curry spices to what ever heat you wish! Simply amazing.  Aside from the food being tastey, service is and always has been delightful.   The End.",

One day my best friend and I were headed over to Monta Ramen... starving and what not.. and realized maybe it wasn't the greatest idea with 10 parties ahead of us. PERFECT TIMING TO TRY THAT RESTAURANT!!!!  So we walked over and browsed the menu, checked Yelp! and went on in. We were lucky that it wasn't too busy. We were seated promptly by Jason Kim and were served our beverages immediately. The quaintness of the curry shop was GREAT. My friends and I are always looking for comfortable restaurants with welcoming atmospheres. The chef and owner came and greeted us personally which I felt was rare in most restaurants.   I ordered the pork cutlet curry with potato croquette, and Di had the chicken cutlet with potato croquette. The curry was delicious and they had everything you needed to customize to your preference! They had their own mild blend of spices, the medium, the spicy, raisins, and almonds. The service was very prompt and since the restaurant is small, it felt very personal. The prices are awesome too, I think we paid about $10 for each plate.  Since I had seen on Yelp! that someone else recommended trying their specials... I came back several days later to try the Spinach Curry. I LOVED that they were consistent with the flavor and texture of the curry. I also tried their Curry Pan.. which is a fried pastry with a bit of their curry. IT IS AWESOME! I'm on a diet but I bought two to-go so I could eat them at work the next day!   LOVE THIS PLACE :)",

It is most similar to Coco Ichibanya. I had the pork cutlet with a level 5 spice. The pork itself was great, with good texture and taste, and the curry was yummy too. The level 5 spice definitely had a kick to it. Only thing is I would add additional items if you are looking for more than fried pork, curry, and meat. For example, a friend added the vegetables and it looked pretty good. I also tried the katsu don (great option if you don't want curry). It wasn't too busy when we came in around 6 p.m. but definitely started filling up by the time we left.",

    "text": "I have been waiting for another cheap, quick Japanese eatery to open up.  After a couple of ramen places and a soba place, I suppose the move to a curry house makes sense.  I do have to make it clear to some who may not be familiar with \"Japanese Curry\" that it is NOT like Indian or Thai curry, as much as Japanese \"Ramen\" is unlike Chinese noodle bowls and such from where it originated from.  Japanese culture has a tendency to import certain things, modify them and make them their own after much time.  Curry is very commonly cooked in Japanese households, and it is almost like hamburger is to the American diet.    The menu is simple and self explanatory on their website, so I'm not going in to details.    As for the curry, it was was good, somewhat safe, and not overly unique, but as the only curry house in Vegas (I guess I shouldn't say that now that Kaba is not just in a truck anymore?)  I think it's better to make it not too out of the ordinary.  As for spiciness, it was mild-moderate, definitely a LOT less spicy than that at Cafe de Japon, and I am not certain whether you can ask to make it spicier or not.    I would say that the portions are quite BIG.  Regular size with pork cutlet to make a katsu curry for example will get you quite full.  I think half size and katsu is almost enough to feed most people.  Even plain curry ($4.50, cheap!) is plenty large.    Unfortunately they sold of out desserts which included annin dofu and Coffee jello that looked really good.    The service was quick and friendly, and for an opening day (besides from running out of desserts), they seem to be moving quite efficiently.    All in all, I was quite pleased to have an authentic curry house in town which should give us additional options for quick inexpensive Japanese food besides from ramen and soba, and I'm looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "Addicting. Consistent every time. Delicious.  I have been to this place no less than thirty times. It's odd that curry-gravy could have such an effect on me, but this place stays on my mind.   It's so simple: choice of meat, white or brown rice, and curry sauce. And yet, it's so much more.   The breading on the Chicken Tender is crispy and perfect every time. I've had the Katsu and grilled chicken as well, also great. The rice is standard, though I am impressed that their brown rice is just as soft and easy to eat as the regular white rice. Not all restaurants have the capability or knowledge to do this, and its evident that brown rice is often the more \"challenging\" of the two. Not here.  The curry sauce is to die for. It's as mild or spicy as you choose, and I love that I can choose. It is more of a gravy consistency, which is very different from the thinner Indian or Thai curries. The taste isn't for everyone though. I happen to be half Middle Eastern and grew up on my grandmother's afterschool curry, so I welcome the heat and the spices. Also, I'm not a fan of dark-meat chicken, so the Chicken Tender option was made for me.  The toppings are fun too. There are little jars on the tables with things like pickled radish (red), pearl onions (white), sliced almonds, and raisins. I was a little hesitant to throw these on my curry at first, but the flavors are so mild and add a brightness and a fresh element to the rich curry. Still won't do the raisins, but everything else is a must for me.  The service is standard for a Japanese restaurant. Every employee greets you when you come in, and thanks you when you leave. My favorite server is Misaki, as she remembers me every time, always has a great attitude, and is the most personable of all.  I will be back in the foreseeable future, like probably twice this week.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times already so I guess it's time to write a review.   My first visit: I wasn't too impressed by their curry, in fact I thought it was a bit salty (but maybe that might have been the katsu). What I did like was that the curry already had some heat without needing to add any more spice. I enjoy piling my plate with tons of fukujinzuke and a little bit of rakkyo. The topping that I chose was chicken katsu and it was a big serving of the meat. I've experienced in places where they skimp on the size of katsu and the rest of the serving is just all curry. Overall, first visit was a 3 stars.  Second visit: Was a lot better, in my opinion. I ordered korokke with fried ebi as toppings this time. If I order the croquette all by itself it might not satisfy my hunger, but since I also added fried shrimp (which comes in three) it definitely satiated the monster living inside my belly. The curry this time tasted freakin' fantastic. Their curry is definitely for those who like 'em a little on the spicy side. Plus, you have the choice of adding more heat with the three different \"powders\" available on each table.   This place is reminiscent of curry restaurants I've been to as a child. Curry Zen is pretty basic though, since curry houses in Japan has tons load of different toppings available. But for what Vegas can offer, this place is pretty darn good.",

    "text": "The concept of Zen is something I've never given much thought to or belief in.  It sounds nice and all (understatement of the year?), but frankly I'm too concerned with work, beating the next level of Candy Crush (427!), and watching every minute of every NFL game possible to give any time towards self-meditation.   Total enlightenment can wait, the Browns vs Jaguars is on the NFL Network.   Who would have known I would take the first step towards this total enlightenment in the form of an hour lunch break at a curry joint on Spring Mountain?  Holy Buddha is this curry legit!  The broth contains more spices than Snoop Lion's tour bus, and each has health benefits if you're to believe the back of the menu and table displays.   I believe! The first time I went with what Tetsuro P proclaimed to be the best item there which was the pork cutlet.  I also added spinach and requested brown rice.  Each and every piece of pork was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful.   The spinach sopped up lots of the broth and the combination of all the components on the plate was a revelation.  Even better, they provide several additional fixings at no cost including raisins, almonds, and some japanese pickled veggies.   I tried incorporating each and every one in different ways and I'm not exaggerating when I say every single bite was delicious.  You couldnt mess this broth up if you TRIED.  Next time I'm bringing some durian and gummy bears and dropping them in and seeing what happens.   Odds are it'll still be delicious.   On the 2nd visit I tried the Beef, and it was as good as I expected even if I preferred the pork cutlet overall.     As an added bonus the service is incredible.   Greeted warmly when I enter, making sure no drink or side is ever empty, and a gracious goodbye upon exiting.   It doesn't get any better  When I think back upon my two incredible experiences here, I now find myself sometimes staring blankly into my computer screen at work, mouth watering from the thought of this wonderful restaurant.  Mind and body united in want of curry drenched pork cutlet.   Total enlightenment achieved.",

The first time I went here it was a Saturday night and was part of a large group (more than ten  people) and we were seated within 10 minutes. For me spicy level 4 was perfect. It creeps up on you though and lingers after, so beware! I like the spinach curry with chicken cutlet and sausage. There's some jars of pickled veggies on the table and they add a nice texture to the dishes. I like the ginger the best. Try this place out ...

But let me tell you, I'm glad I came here. First of all, I LOVE curry. If only my husband would eat curry then I'll probably make it all the time. Anyway, about this curry place. I love it! The curry is how I've always known it to be. Just like when I was still living in Japan. The staff are ok. Maybe a little more friendliness won't hurt. But the food is really good. The server will ask you how hot/spicy you would like your curry to be. I chose 7. It was pretty spicy. Just the way I like it. I had the burger patty with rice and curry on it! Yum! I will definitely come back and try the Katsu curry next time.",

The Chicken Katsu we breaded and had just the right \"crisp\" to it.  I opted for a level 2, which had just the right amount of heat for me, and my wife went with the mild. She also said it reminded her or Okinawa...and we took to-go plates as well.

I understand that there are different kinds of spices on the side of the table so you can add your own spice to your own curry, but still... after all it is just powder you are adding to your curry, it's not the same... A lot of curry house in Japan, you can pick how spicy! Also, we ordered hot green tea and we got hot water with tea bag inside the mug cup... I was actually surprised...

But one day I decided to go here since I already had my Monta fix that weekend. I was not disappointed. The curry is flavorful, best I've ever had. The spice level of the curry is actually spicier than other curry places I've been too. I always get spice level 10 at curry places and don't really feel a kick, but this place does have a decent kick for me at level 10. I had the Chicken Katsu w/ Kushi 5pc add on. Everything was still crispy till the end of the meal, Chicken was moist, and i loved the quail eggs. Service was excellent and food comes out pretty fast. This place would probably be one of places I must go while I'm in Vegas",

I ordered the pork cutlet curry rice and it was very good, especially with the pepper seasoning and Japanese pickles.   I paid $9.13 for the plate and I thought it was more worth $6 or $7. The restaurant is a little smaller than Monta, so you might have to wait outside. The owner was very nice; he said the curry recipe was a family recipe. All in all, I would have to say the curry is legit and I would come back.",

    "text": "Japanese Curry Zen is a decent place to check out if you're looking for Japanese style curry rice.  The Food (3 out of 5):  Okay, I've been here a couple of times now, and both times I have had the Tonkatsu (pork) curry rice which is good and tasty. Now, curry rice is a staple in most Japanese households, and I am really used to not only having the white rice with pork cutlet & curry sauce over it, but also with other vegetables in the curry sauce as well (i.e. potatoes, carrots and sometimes celery). So, I was disappointed by the fact that you could not add any of these kinds of additional veggies. Also, they really should offer Tabasco sauce in the restaurant as well as another kind of ginger (their ginger is kind of sweet).   The Service (3 out of 5):  Service has been good here but not great. On the last time here we had to wait a little bit to get refills on our waters and to get more ginger. Yes, they were busy at the time, but then again, it's not like you can pack a lot of people in the restaurant. I didn't like the fact that our table for 2 was really close to the table for 4 next to us, it was kind of like we were there with that other party.   OVERALL: If you have a hankering for Japanese curry (or if you don't want to wait too long at Monta a few doors down), then this is a decent place to go. However, I do think that I can cook a much better curry rice myself though!",

    "text": "This is a great place for curry. If you are from Hawaii, longing for Curry House, then this is your best bet. They offer an array of meat to accompany your curry, or you can opt for a simple curry sauce and rice. Zen is located in the same complex where Monta Ramen is. If you don't know about Monta...yelp.   There is a base price of 5.95 and price goes up depending what and how many items you add into your curry. The great thing about this place is that they do have vegeterian selections, and they also offer side dishes/appetizers such as takoyaki, deep fried oysters, shumai, edamame, and much more but my photographic memory failed me.  Today, we ordered 2 of the chicken katsu curry, deep fried shumai, and a spam curry. My son loves spam so of course he had to order it. The spam slices came out really thick, think he only had three slices of it, but again...they were pretty thick of a cut. I shared my katsu plate with my 6 year old so we ordered an extra scoop of rice. I love curry; I just don't enjoy the heavy feeling. Sharing with my son was the perfect portion for both of us. The chicken katsu itself was delightful. It was perfectly crisped, the meat didn't look \"dead\" inside (you know...that dry old chicken look),  and the fact that it isn't seasoned at all or heavily season is also a plus to me, because it'll be chillin on top of curry sauce anyway. As well all know...curry has enough depth, the extra sodium on a breaded chicken would be unnecessary. 1 thing I did wish is that my curry sauce came out a little bit more hot temperature wise. It was more like lukewarm. I'm just one of those people who love seeing steam come from my plate. It's confirmation to me my food is coming out fresh. Hell, it could've been microwaved for all I know if there were steam, but I wouldn't know--I just know I want it to look like it came fresh out the pot.  It was busy when we arrived, but we did not have to wait at all. We came in on a Tuesday afternoon, but twas Veteran's day so perhaps twas the reason for a full house? The facility was very clean. The waitresses were attentive. We did have to ask for our waters to get refilled at the end of our meal, but two refills prior to that they came without question. Tables kinda sit close to each other as the facility isn't big. So no nasty talk unless you want the people next to you joining in. Lol. I don't recommend bringing a stroller in there as well. I didn't have mine, but when I walked in I thought thank goodness I didn't bring it in. Kinda figured considering we are on Spring Mountain and such eateries along it don't offer plenty of stroller room anyway.   For my family of 6 our bill came out into a whopping 32bucks, that's with tax. Can't say the same for others because I still have kids that are in the sharing zone. Good deal to us. Anyway, before I get 'curried' away....pause....I will certainly be returning whenever we are feeling Zen like.",

Flavor was  perfect but temperature of the curry was semi cold.  I want to eat steaming hot curry with medium spice.  I want the cheese to melt.  I will try this place again and I might give more stars but I'm not sure if I should request the curry extra hot temp or just chance it????!? I see the cooks working very hard in the back but I wondered why the curry was cold.  Maybe they didn't stir it up good before plating it and the curry sauce at the top got cold.  When I go to a buffet and there's soup, I always stir a few seconds wait to see the steam before I scoop and I get it hot and fresh.  I haven't given up on this place but they better notice that if the curry isn't hot then you can't finish the meal cause it's gross to eat when it's cold.",

Anyone who's been to Okinawa or even mainland Japan knows about this place! When we moved to Las Vegas, we were super happy to discover Japanese Curry Zen!! It's amazing curry. Such a great comfort food.   We eat here quite often and constantly recommend it to our friends and coworkers. If you like spicy foods and curry, you must try this place out! I normally go for the chicken cutlet level 2 spice. It's perfect and you can always turn up the heat with the extra spices they have on the tables if need be.  We've tried Kaba Curry in town as well, but prefer Curry Zen. The prices are reasonable also. They've recently expanded the restaurant which allows much more seating then before. I've had to wait outside before they added the extra seating, but now we get a table almost every time.   They also have great iced thai tea! Check em out!!!!!!",

I have to say though, they are so Stingy on that stuff that you can probably just have some at home and save yourself a $1.00 Also when you order (extra) anything make sure you double check with them as to how they Add Extra - because I got cheated one day on my rice.. Never again will that happen.  I advise though, there are only 3 tables in this place and 10 seats at the bar, way small place... So doing the take out thing is AWESOME!!!  Food is good tasting stuff though... Totally love Curry... so I like this! Yes ^__^ ..",

Sadly I am not there..but places like curry zen makes me feel a little better  I could spend days explaining the taste of this place, and it would not compare to the experience at all. This place is simply magnificent. The quality, the presentation and the flavor are out of this world and to top that the service , courtesy and warmth of the servers and chefs make this one of my new favorite spots.  The spot is small but thankfully ive never had to spend time waiting. Maybe its because the damn hipsters haven't find this yet and I am cool with that !.  The pork is so tender and the curry is thick with a decent amount of rice as <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwell.Be&s=77aeefeed8272d1ff24045048bcfd61794dc1ac8f7c346e93b5d5ba4f566aa7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">well.Be</a> sure to try the enderloin at least once.If it feels a little too expensive for you, stay with the chicken if you want..it still tastes epic. If you lke it hot they wont change it while cooking however you get the spices in the table. Not a biggie..I like getting the legit thing so not altering it actually works for me.  Everytime I went my glass was NEVER empty and had the staff checking for satisfaction all the time. Seriously the service was better than most 5 star restaurants..and why? Because they were sincere!! You can see them wanting you to enjoy.. that my foodies; is priceless .  Want to know what is the hardest thing for me to do? Go to that plaza..sit down in my car and look at monta...look at zen..look at monta again..zen one more time.. MY HEAD WILL EXPLODE one of these days. I need to figure a system out.. It is like going to a strip club and have \"destiny\" and \"charity\" (classic stripper names btw) offering you buy one get 2 free!! DON'T JUDGE ME.  Do yourself a favor and try it. Get that JDM hotness in you and you wont be able to let go!",

Apparently that's also the case for many Japanese in town including the owner of Cafe de Japon who we bumped into and had the pleasure of dining with.  He got natto with his curry.  I didn't know that was something Japanese did?  I think natto is super gross but I guess drowning it in rich curry sauce would be the most acceptable way for me to scarf it down.    Most of the meat options are breaded and fried with the exception of the kurobuta sausage.  I got the pork katsu with cheese and my wife went with chicken katsu and cheese.  Both were excellent and terrific portions.  I also liked how they offered almonds, raisins, sweet onions and pickles on the side.  I'd never put almonds on my curry before but it made for great texture.  I ate a ton of onions since that went really well with the crunch and juiciness of the pork.      I would like to see a few more options for curry including a straight up beef option and maybe an unfried chicken too but that's not a big thing.  Friendly service, Japaneezy atmosphere and great curry is what will ensure my return.  Free wifi is a plus.",

We decided to do take-out to stray away from the lunch rush hour and ate at home instead. I ordered the chicken katsu curry that they separated for our take-out order. Now while the amount of curry they provide is actually a decent amount, I can't say that they give you enough chicken katsu to eat WITH the curry. By the time we were done with the chicken, we had way too much leftover curry. While I do feel as if they skimped us on the chicken katsu, the curry makes up for it - I could've dumped the curry over some white rice and called it a day. I do suggest that they should really re-evaluate their food portions for a more \"even\" meal.",

The menu is very simple, choose type of curry, choose meat, choose spice level, enjoy.   I was able to indulge in the Pork Katsu Original Curry with extra Kurubota Sausage with spice level 4 and the Curry-Don which was a relatively new item on the menu. The meat in the Curry-Don was thin sliced pork and seemed to have a pretty good kick at spice level 3.   We came a little later for lunch so didn't have to wait too long for our larger group, but service was excellent. Expect to pay $10-11 for some top-notch curry. I have to admit that this review may be a little biased because I had been craving Japanese curry for months. But I'd give this a solid 4.5 and bump it up to 5 for what was an amazing meal.",

I'm personally in the service industry and I can say with confidence that the flow of my service was spectacular. He met ever demand with ease and has a very genuine/kind way about him. THE CURRY! So delicious! I got vegetable curry, spice level 7, with a chicken katsu. The chicken Katsu in itself was something to praise. All white meat with a good amount of chicken in between the outer crust. It was perfectly golden! Everything about this place was amazing! My friend's and I will definitely be spending a fair amount of time here in the future.",

    "text": "I originally ordered two original curries from Postmates, but when the order arrived there was only one curry. This didn't upset me, I know people make mistakes and it probably could've been the Postmates driver's fault. So I call Curry Zen, explain my dilemma and ask if I can go pick up my second order, they agree and so I head over. I walk in and as I'm waiting I make eye contact with two waitresses yet I'm not greeted, I wait a bit longer and two couples enter behind me. One of the waitresses goes up to the couples and seats them completely ignoring me.  At this point I'm furious for having to drive across town to just be ignored. After seating them, they continue to ignore me until I finally go up to one of them and ask to speak to a manager. This waitress completely disregards my question and simply says \"How can I help you?\"  I tell her I called earlier about my order being incomplete and she walks away to get my order. Finally the server comes back with my meal but I ask her that I think it would be fair if they give me a sort of credit for all the trouble they had put me through, she struggles to understand what I'm saying (there may have been a language barrier) and says no. She then calls another server to help (I'm assuming the manager). The next server is quite nice and provides me with an extra order for all the trouble, I then thank her and leave. I finally get home and when eating my curry I come to find out that it is extremely spicy though I had ordered no spice (level 3). So I end up having to throw my meal away because I tend to get sick from eating food that is too spicy. I feel as if they purposely did this for asking for some sort of compensation, which I think is ridiculous after everything they put me through. I wasted an hour and a half of my time and money that I'll never get back. I'm hoping this was just a fluke, but I hope they read this and not let some other poor soul go through what I had to.",

You can have chicken with curry, shrimp with curry, pork with curry, tofu with curry or beef with curry. :-D If you want Japanese curry it's the place to go, if you want more variety you probably want to find another place.

    "text": "I don't really have a lot to say about Curry Zen. It's just an average place all around in my opinion.  The curry is decent in flavor but the price seems a bit much. The menu is set up so that you pick your curry base and then from there you add on whatever you want to dip in your curry. So far I've gotten the chicken katsu and kushi options. The food is good. It's why I've come here a few times, but in all honesty it just feels average. Nothing really stands out to me. It doesn't leave me wanting more. It's just average.  They do earn some brownie points for having a rating system on the spiciness of their curry that is actually accurate and wonderful presentation on the plate.  Other than that, I really have to be craving curry specifically if i'm going to go out of my way to come here.",

Great option when you are tired, hungry and don't want too many choices. Maybe you've had a few drinks earlier and just want to get in, out and get to sleep- whatever your story.   Service is lightning fast and food comes out almost right away.   On a late Saturday night they were packed with not one open table, but they turn fast, so stick around and a table will likely open up quickly. We only waited about a minute before a couple that was done with their meal got up so we could grab a seat.   They do have a few very reasonably priced draft selections, if you are drinking.   All in all, not a special trip place, but quick, satisfying and effortless.",

    "text": "PLEASE EAT HERE!  Ok so I rarely give 5 stars and especially rarely give it for a Japanese restaurant in the US.... That's mainly because my wife is Japanese (from japan) and I of course lived there for 7 yrs... We've actually only been back in the US for about 2 weeks ... So Japanese food (real) is still fresh on our pallets.  So those of you that know me, know that CoCoIchibanya is my absolute #1-2-3-4-5 favorite restaurant of allllllll time.  So when we found this spot on Yelp, Sakino recommend we try it as she knows I'm missing curry, specifically CoCos.. When in Hawaii, I drag her there. When in LA, I drag her there. When at our home in Okinawa... Well that's home so I can't drag her anywhere lol, but she lets me go like once a week!  So of course I'm feeling a little standoffish about this place... Most of our American Japanese dining experiences thus far have been ehhhh.... So in we go. Right off the bat, they have that CoCoIchi yellowish colored menu...  Ok. Then I notice something, everyone in this place (staff) is actually Japanese, and speaking Japanese! This please my wife and I a lot... Sounds silly I know but it's kinda rare to have actual Japanese people that speak Japanese in a Japanese restaurant in America. And they were legit, when my wife conversed with them they didn't skip a beat or look lost. Plus 1 pt for these guys! !so then I order.. Old faithful. Chicken katsu curry with cheese level 2. Exactly as I would a CoCos... Sakino ordered the same only level 3.  So, what I will tell you is this: if you know and love CoCos, this place WILL DO JUST FINE! Is it better? No. Is it pretty much equal? Ehhhh yea sure. Point is for Vegas, this place is basically CoCos, which earns it a 5 star for me... The food is great, the service is great and authentic... Point in case, we come in and Sakino (my wife) sees a young Japanese waitress... She keeps staring and telling me hey hey doesn't she look so familiar? I'm like yea I guess. Sakino was like you know when I was an exchange student at University of Hawaii, I swear that waitress was also a student there on exchange from mainland Japan! I'm like sure I guess but I don't remember babe... So my wife is like ok, after we eat I'll ask her... Well before that even happens, the young girl walks over and is like omg hey remember me from Hawaii etc etc... Turns out it IS Misakichan and she is HERE going to school now... And not only that, today was her first day at this job! What a crazy coincidence that a girl from Okinawa, a girl from mainland Japan, both exchange student to Hawaii, 2yrs later bump into each other at a curry house in Las Vegas? Wtf?! Point is, the people here are great. They are authentic as it gets, and the food is ON POINT! Large for me small for her, 2 drinks, plus tip.. $25 total... Which by the way, is exactly what I'd pay at CoCoIchi.... These guys here at Zen Curry in Vegas are onto something... If the local Air Force guys here that have been stationed at Kadena AFB ever find out.. This place will be packed!  Please please please ... Check this place out! So worth it  ",

There was a big party taking up the only tables in the place and we ended up at the counter.  A little claustrophobic maybe at the counter.  The menu is small.  There basically is one curry that can have a few options of meat and everything comes with rice.  But the curry is good and flavorful and makes me happy.  It has something like 13 different spices in it which all contribute to your health somehow.  None the less we gobbled up everything on our plates, didn't pay very much and we left with a warm belly of curry.",

The decor is modern, warm and clean the service was extremely polite and fast and the chef was behind the counter to be watched while plating his food.    This is a bit like a fast food but comfort food but way better, let me explain why.  They have a 15 spice blend with a guide on the back of the menu explaining the benefits of adding these spices to your food.  I have been to a couple of curry places in town and basically I could have bought the same mixture from a box and added water and had the same thing.  This place is different you can tell it is freshly made daily.  The flavors  of the curry is a strong but very mild flavor at the same time (I know that doesn't make sense but if you eat it you will understand).  You have quite a few options for the meat portion of the meal from chicken, fried pork chop  and a few more.  The rice is plentiful and good you also have a brown rice option for a healthier carb addition to your meal.  THIS is the curry I had in Japan this is the curry I have been looking for since my trip to Japan.  I am extremely happy and will be back for sure.",

I've tried many places that had curry all around Vegas and this is by far my second favorite. I've only ate here at least three times and I'm really looking forward to going back!!! Although it might not look presentable, it's very tasty. If this is your first time at Japanese Curry Zen, I recommend the Chicken Cutlet.",

    "text": "I started this account just to write this review.  I love Curry and have eaten many curry dishes even lived in Honolulu, Hawaii where CoCos was on top of my list, but compare to the service and taste.  I got a new favorite Curry House. Also I can't stopped thinking about this curry, considering it was my first time trying Japanese Curry Zen, 3 days ago. yes 3 days of thinking about it every time eat my home cooked meals(and I love what i make at home)  So I went with my roommate Elizabeth L. (check out her review 5/13/13) to eat @ Monta Ramen(which was close by and is also pretty good) and after that we went to Japanese Curry Zen to order \"To Go\" for dinner because we were working that night and had no time to cook but once we got home we wanted to have a little nibble just to try and ended up eating it all. even though we were full from Monta Ramen. The staff and cooks are so nice and smiley.   I guess you can say this isn't really a review but a praise and declaration that i will be going back there for more. =)  Tried the Curry with pork cutlets and Curry Pan and Croquettes, I love my curry spicy and the sweet Miss who gave us our order packed lots of chili powder for me togo when I asked.",

    "text": "Although the menu is very basic, I think this newly opened Japanese curry place will do quite well.  There are only 3 tables in this restaurant, but they also have bar seating, where you sit facing the cooks while they are preparing the food.  I counted a total of 18 seats in this restaurant.  But for such a small restaurant, they had quite a few people working there.  I believe there were a total of 8 people including the owner.  Luckily this place wasn't very busy when I arrived for lunch, so I was able to sit at a table.  The service was very good, which is typical of Japanese restaurants.  I ordered their pork cutlet curry on rice and a side order of chicken katsu. Their curry sauce is quite good, but I would have preferred a little bit more curry sauce.  I also tried their curry pan and it was delicious.  This deep fried panko bun with curry inside would have been perfect had it been a little bit warmer.  It was very tasty and the texture of the bun was excellent.   For a quick Japanese curry fix, give this place a try.",

This is a very tiny restaurant; seats about 15-20 people. So if you go with a big group you will have to wait.   I ate here twice before and ordered the same thing; pork katsu curry. It's not too spicy and not too sweet so it's the perfect combo! If you want to make it more spicy, you can always add the spices that they have on the side of the table. The size of the curry is big & so is the katsu.  If I'm ever craving curry, I'll definitely come back here!",

For $6-$9 this does not have anything worth going out of your way for. The curry itself did have a character of its own. But at the end of the meal, it wasn't worth the curry burps I inflicted on my girlfriend, coworkers, and anyone in a throwing stars reach.   Not to mention the small butt parade stomping through my intestines by the end of the night. Christ! I love curry from all regions of Asia, but I haven't heard my stomach make these sounds since I was forced to watch 5 minutes of Twilight. At least then I passed out and it was over.  In spite of my sarcasm, the service was decent and orders came out quickly. I wouldn't make an out of the way trip for this place, but if someone is determined to go, you happen to be with them, and drinking, sleeping, taking an SAT/GMAT, or a 24hr Roberto's is still not an option because it's closed...go check it out. But there are several other places in that shopping center that are worth more of your time.",

While the size of the store makes it feel a bit cramped at times when it's busy, I can let it slide since whenever I eat there I always end up feeling a bit better than when I left.  But let's get to the nitty gritty -- the food. I love curry and I'm not a stickler from where it comes from. Amongst all the places I've tried curry from (Thai Noodle House, Surangs Thai Kitchen, Mt Everest, Shuseki, and various Korean restaurants) I think Zen Curry's is my favorite. The curry itself has a nice density to it and the flavor always stands out. Combined with large portion sizes at a decent price, eating here won't break the bank.  The menu itself is pretty simple (katsu, pork, steak) but they have a large board that has some specials in terms of what meat or addons you can get for your curry.",

It comes in a variety pack of flavors of meat and veggies on a deep fried kabob Japanese style. Best part of it all, they were deep fried. I also recommend deep fried spam and their 5 piece deep fried oyster. Just sprinkle a lil bit of lemon over them for zest~",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW: I've been coming to Zen Curry ever since it opened and i'm still so impressed every single time i go. The only changed i've noticed is that they serve a bit less food than before but rather than that i still give this place 10/10! I never go to any other places for Japanese curry, ONLY here! It's such comforting soul food and i'm OBSESSED!! I'm constantly craving zen curry and i could eat here for a week straight which i did before lol. This is located down spring mountain in a really jammed packed location because of other popular restaurants and desert cafes so parking is a butt, but it's so worth it when you taste the curry!! You get a big plate and basically you build your own curry! What so love about this place is that they have healthy options if you're a vegetarian or watching what you eat! What I love to get here is the Chicken Katsu (so delicious and juicy) with level 3 spice and the 5 piece Kushi (quail eggs, chicken, mushroom, shrimp, and zucchini?) or i get it with cheese and corn with just the chicken katsu & curry! Remember to get the red radish as well (i can't eat it w.o this). These dishes here has so many different kind things you can add on, the spam and croquette is delicious as well. My mouth is watering just typing this and I can't wait to be back.   The service here is AMAZING ALL THE TIME! Their staffs are super knowledgeable about their menu and are so kind. There's this one employee guy that's so so sweet (i didn't catch his name) but we left him a $20 tip and he literally went out of the restaurant to look for us and kept bowing his head saying he can't accept such a big tip and we said he deserved it, like this made me so teary and melt my heart because he's so genuine and kind. Thank you zen curry for excellent services and staffs!  Overall, I don't have any complaints but the fact that it's super tiny and the wait time is long sometimes but i mean that's what you get for having such an amazing restaurant and good quality food!!",

    "text": "Oishii! Authentic! Real Japanese curry-- like Japan! Make sure you put all the condiments on top- the red little pickles, white picked onions, raisins, sliced almonds...   Got the chicken katsu- white rice baby. Added cheese and corn (50 cents each). Level 3 spice. Delish! The crunchy, moist chicken katsu, with the warm, sticky rice. The sweetness of raisins and the crunch of almonds, combined with the sour umami of the pickled red condiments. So good!   Pretty lame I don't remember the real name of the red stuff. Cut some slack, 3 rd generation Japanese American :).   Hubs lived in Japan, and said it's as authentic as it gets, except in Japan, you can add a raw egg.   Hubs also added a potato croquet to his and loved it.   Small place, but no problem seating our group of 9 on a Sat night. Busy little strip mall, with a convenient bobba tea place nearby.   Edamame was a large serving for $3.50.   Highly recommend this hidden gem!!",

I love places with limited menus because that means that the restaurant must be very good at what they do.  My theory held True for Japanese Curry Zen.  I got the chicken katsu curry with rice and it was absolutely delicious.  The katsu was so crispy and juicy.  The curry was amazing and had just the right amount of heat (you can specify how spicy you want it!).  The portion size was pretty decent, probably good for a person with a regular sized appetite.  However, I was still hungry after my meal - I don't know if it's because it wasn't  big enough for me or it was just so good that I wanted to eat more of it!    The service is good too.  I was seated quickly and my food came out pretty fast.  I  would definitely recommend this place.  Delicious simple food and great service.  However, this parking lot is pretty annoying.  I came here on a Friday night and was extremely annoyed by the large number of people who appear to not know how to operate a vehicle.  Just watch out because it could get congested and people seem to now have horrible parking skills.",

I always get the 3 piece (quail egg, zucchini, and chicken) or 5 piece Kushi (with mushroom and shrimp)  (when I'm super duper hungry!) - add corn and spicy level 3! Of course I ask for their pickles too!! This is the perfect meal!  I usually also order their Takoyaki and sometimes gyoza! I have also tried their tofu salad which is also really good! The dressing is very light!   The place is pretty small and can get very busy during lunch time, sometimes there is a little wait but the wait is worth it! The service is also really good compared to other places in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Its kind of crazy how popular this place is when all it serves is curry. Especially in a strip mall that has a handful of other really well known Japanese restaurants. But the curry is insanely good and if you're craving curry, this is the place to go.   My boyfriend and I went in for a late lunch and although it wasn't very busy at first, it filled up completely as we ate. We both had the $3 Kirin draft (can you even eat Japanese food without draft beer?) and an order of fried shumai to start. I usually like all dumpling foods to be steamed and not fried but these ended up being pretty good. They're small, but filled with meat and delicious with Chinese mustard. My boyfriend ordered the chicken katsu curry with corn and cheese and I had the beef curry spicy level 10. I'm pretty traditional with my curry... I haven't quite mastered all these add ons and it seems weird to put cheese on curry especially. Cheese isn't really a staple in Asian food. But of course cheese makes everything better. I had a bite of the chicken katsu curry and the corn and cheese did add some more texture to the dish. My boyfriend said it reminded him of the KFC Famous Bowl which is hilarious. The beef curry was awesome all by itself though. I did have to ask for some pickled radish and onion and I stirred those in, not sure why those don't come with the dish already. I was surprised at how spicy it really was since I've read they can actually get even higher than the level 10. There were about six chunks of beef in the dish, but I shredded them up and they went further. My only complaint about both dishes was that the temperature of the curry itself could have been a bit warmer. I noticed this especially with the cheese in the katsu curry, I think it would help it melt more. Anyways, great meal at Curry Zen and it's always enough food to bring home so I'll be eating it later as well!",

The interior design was pretty neat and the table size had enough room for me to eat comfortably.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry spice level 4. The spice level ranges from 1-10 with the lowest number being less spicy. Level 4 was still really spicy so if you're not a big fan of spicy I would recommend 1 or 2. My brother is a big fan of spicy but he can't really handle the level 7.  The dish was a nice size for the price. The chicken katsu was perfectly cooked and gave a decent portion of white rice.   Service was very fast and friendly. She refilled my water when I needed it and the food was brought to our table in a very reasonable time.  Thank you to the staff of Zen Curry!",

As a result, I guess I can say that my review might be different from others because I didn't eat in, and I didn't eat the staple meal they sell here (the curries). But as katsudon also includes breaded pork like the curries on the menu, I figured I would talk about it anyway.  I love Japanese pork cutlets when they're made well. They're crisp, but not dry or hard, and the meat inside is usually soft and moist. It just melds together and tastes great. The cutlet in the katsudon, meanwhile, tasted awful. Traditionally, it is a pork cutlet with rice an egg cooked on top of it, and the egg yolk and white are supposed to complement the taste of the meat.   This one had the egg on top and the whole thing looked (deceptively) visually appealing, but the whole thing was so over seasoned to the point that eating the cutlet was really difficult because it tasted SO SALTY. I couldn't taste the egg over the taste of what felt like pork dunked in soy sauce. On top of that, the cutlet was very, very dry and it felt like chewing into a rock. I knew the pork was there but I couldn't really taste it over the sodium and the hardness of the outer shell.   It goes without saying that the sauce leaked down all the way to the bottom of the bowl, and even as I started to eat mix and bring some of the rice to the top, I noticed the white rice was pretty much soggy and brown with the sauce. The rice also tasted way too strong at this point, and I just couldn't enjoy it. Maybe the curries are better, but I wouldn't recommend the katsudon here at all.",

There is some parking on the street and in the empty lot across the street.    I came here at noon on a Monday and It was busy but we were able to score a seat.  We arrived at the perfect time because a line at the door started to form.  It is a small restaurant.  The menu is quite simple.  They offer different curry plates featuring the typical chicken katsu, Pork katsu, cheese and spinach, and so on.  They also have a diy version where everything is a la carte.  They also have spicy levels from 1-10.    I ordered the pork katsu curry, level 2 spiciness and added cheese and corn.  From the appetizer menu, my friend and I tried the takoyaki.  The takoyaki surprised me a bit.  I actually enjoyed It! I didn't think that It would be as good as It was because the main dish was curry.  I'm now craving the takoyaki! Lol.  The curry dish I had was alright.  I did have to chase down a server for some of the pickled ginger.  It is the main reason why I eat curry!  I wish that they gave a bigger portion of ginger or even have It available at the table because the servers are really hard to chase down.  Other than that, It was good.  I do miss Curry House back home in Hawaii but this restaurant will do.    I ended up paying about $20 for my meal with add ons and tip.  The service is a bit lacking and wish that could be better the next time I go.  The servers don't really refill the waters and It did take a while for our bill to come back...",

The loaf was soft and not dry at all. It tasted lovely with and without the curry. Spicy 4 was somewhere above a mild but nowhere near medium.  - Pork Katsu. A house favorite but I felt the katsu was a bit dry and a bit too lean.  Overall: - Ordering + menu options were simple. - Eating here is great for solo diners. - The serving size was perfect.   Con: - The additional fee for spicy curry!  Note: We came at 11:27am and a line was already forming. By 12pm, the restaurant was full but turnover seemed fairly quick.",

    "text": "Japanese Curry Zen is located in Chinatown, just a few miles from the strip. Located in the same plaza as Raku, Kung Fu Tea (very close by actually) and Hwaro.  My husband and I decided to grab a late diner here this past Sunday night, around 9:25 pm. As soon as I came in here, I wrote my name on the sign up list. We waited a little less than 15 minute and we seated (even though there were 2 groups of 4 people ahead of us, we were able to get a table before them since a small table of 2 opened up).   After looking over the menu, we ended up ordering:  Pork Katsu Curry, $10.45 prior to tax + $0.20 extra for spice level 5- My husband opted for this entree and at the level 5 spice level. Please note that you do pay extra for some of the spicy levels (level 5 and up). My husband thought this spice level was good for him and probably wouldn't go a level higher so that he could still enjoy his curry. Because I am not a spicy eater, I didn't have any of his curry but I did had one piece of his pork katsu. The pork was good and wasn't too oily. Had a nice tender piece. This entree came with a good portion of steamed white rice to soak up all of that curry, which is also a large, generous portion.  Chicken Katsu Curry, $9.95 prior to tax- There most popular item, I asked for this to me mild. The chicken katsu itself is rather bland but of course with the curry, splendid. The curry itself was nice and savory but not too salty. I was pretty full after eating all of this. You do get a pretty good portion of chicken so that this is a filling meal.   Peach Sake, $4.50 prior to tax- I opted for this sparkling sake. Our server described this as a soda and that you can't taste the alcohol. I agree, I couldn't really taste the alcohol in it and I liked this drink. But my husband didn't like it at all. I liked this drink and probably will look for it at the Japanese market near me.  ---------------------------- (Total= $27.17 after tax, prior to tip)  Wait time for our food was just about 10 minutes. I wasn't expecting our food to come out so quick but guess they have a lot of curry already made and ready to add additional ingredients to make it to a particular spicy level per patron and just add on the different protein and toppings the customer orders.   Our server was nice but he was forgetful of bringing me this curry to sample. He had told me that they do a sweet curry and said he could bring me a sample. But being that they were busy I just decided not to ask about it again.   Seating inside is rather small so you can see how a wait for table can soon accumulate rather quickly, especially during peak hours. But this is a place people do not necessarily linger and chat. They just eat and leave. So I don't think you will be waiting too long for a table. And if there is a long wait, consider ordering to go or eating at one of the other delicious restaurants in this plaza.   The ladies restroom was clean upon this visit and adequately stocked with the essentials (please note that this is a single toilet restroom).   Pretty good food, I would definitely come back here again.",

Now I know why. I should be going to shops that specialise in curry or just go home. Unfortunately, home only has one curry shop and its vegetarian selection seems to be limited.  The beer here is cheap ranging from $5.00-6.50 for a 22oz bottle. They have several options that are vegetarian or at least I hope so given I didn't know what the base was for the sauce. I had a spinach and scrambled egg curry, and it was so sick. The spice was healthy at the Level 6 that I ordered. It partially cleared out my stuffed sinuses. All of my other friends enjoyed their dishes including an interesting looking curry udon. The place opens late I look forward to returning here in my visits.",

    "text": "Located in the Seoul Plaza right off Spring Mountain and Decatur, the parking space at this area is tight and very limited. I was entering from the west side and almost missed my turn but thanks to a fellow yelper, I saw Kung Fu Tea as a landmark and turn immediately to the correct plaza. Parking can be a drag when you have to wait for someone to leave. Fortunately when I made that turn, I saw a car coming out and that was a lucky find for a vacant spot.   When you enter the restaurant, there is a reminder sign that says wait to be seated. Kenta was my server, hopefully I heard and spelled his name right, if not then sorry! Seating took within seconds. He immediately brought a glass of water and gave me a couple minutes to look over the menu. I started with Oolong Tea ($1.25), opt for the Tofu Salad ($3.50) ordered Chicken Katsu-Don ($8.95) and request to add corn ($0.75). The Tofu salad has fresh tofu, grape tomatoes, corn, carrot, and thin slice of radish serve over crispy romaine lettuce. It comes with a sesame dressing and it makes the salad taste so delicious!   The Chicken Katsu-Don arrived within 10 minutes, very prompt service. It's chicken cutlet with scrambled egg, pickled turnip, corn, caramelized onion, topped with nori and serve over white rice. The chicken katsu is tender, it has a little sweetness to it but everything in this bowl taste savory and amazingly good! It's even better with that sesame dressing and I just had to ask for another. My hot tea was refilled and the server checked to see if there is anything else I need.   I'm really glad I came here for dinner. Service is quick and efficient. The server is nice to help bag the leftovers. This is a friendly, welcoming, and casual restaurant to dine. They have a bar area but I like sitting at the table. Nice background music and the people are lively. Prices are reasonable and the food is flavorful. I didn't feel rush to finish my hot tea. The food here is worth the visit and I would come back to try the Japanese curry.",

She's correct the parking lot is extremely small for the amount of businesses located in this U- shaped mall. Once you find a parking space you'll forget about the parking situation. We did wait a while to get seated, the restaurant was very busy when we showed up. It was worth the wait. We ordered Shrimp Curry , Pork Katsu Curry and Green Tea Cheesecake. Honestly, the cheese cake tasted like cheese cake I could not taste the green tea. It was good cake. The curry dishes were excellent. If you like Japanese style curry this place is a winner.",

    "text": "My friends and I just wanted somewhere cheap, tasty and fast while on the go. Japanese Curry Zen did just that. Seating was immediate, staff was efficient and the food came out quick.   It's basically the Vegas equivalent to Hawaii's Curry House. You pick what types of curry you want, the spice level and your choice of toppings.  I'm not a big fan of curry in general, but I find the curry here to be tasty and reasonable for what you pay.   TONKATSU/PORK KATSU ($10.45, added 16-grains rice for $1.50): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2OZber4&s=6c4a61b7b8ea2b1da3b54c08f74ee63f582cf34323a8a04ebb7b9373668a1624\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2OZber4</a> The pork was lean, yet tender and juicy. The panko crust had a nice almost buttery finish.  I went with a spice level 7 for the curry, which was tolerable for me since I love all things spicy.  The curry although tasty, was missing the bits of meat that I'm used to having when it comes to Japanese curry. The curry flavoring also wasn't as pronounced as I would've liked.   FRIED OYSTERS ($3.60 for 3pc, $6 for 5pc): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2yIa0WN&s=74cc7d32dd94433613f15c16c5ec568c6a205d5b2b548d060a57e237edf219b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2yIa0WN</a> I've had pretty gnarly-tasting fried oysters in the past, so we decided to just try the smaller 3pc portion.  So.Damn.Good! Same buttery panko crust as the tonkatsu and the briny oysters were tasty and not at all fishy.   CHICKEN KARAAGE ($4.50): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2yIa0WN&s=74cc7d32dd94433613f15c16c5ec568c6a205d5b2b548d060a57e237edf219b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2yIa0WN</a> Seasoned well and juicy. The batter was crunchy and non-oily, as it should be when it comes to good karaage. Portions are small, so order two!  They have a good selection of Japanese beers and sake, all reasonably priced. I tanked a bottle of 22oz Saporo for $3.75, hell ya!  Hours: 11:30am-11pm Parking: Located within a shopping plaza. My friends and I had no problems finding two open stalls for our cars right away.",

Especially since it's the top of the list when you search Japanese Curry for Las Vegas?  Nah, unfortunately not.   We got the: 1)Tofu Katsu Curry (spicy level 5): -Despite being spicy level 5, the curry itself was super bland. -The tofu katsu was literally just breaded tofu with no seasoning. Maybe I've been spoiled by Curry House, which minces the tofu and seasons it before breading and frying, but this was a real drag to eat.   2) Chicken Katsu Curry (spicy level 4 and 7): -The spicy level 7 had a little bit of heat to it, but nothing much to write home about. -The level 4 was even blander than the level 5.   The only pro's to this place was the fact that it's much cheaper than other Japanese curry establishments (at least the one's I've been to) and the service was good.   Whenever I'm in Vegas again, I'll try other places first before giving this place a second chance.",

Great spice combination with a decent variety of cutlet or tender (pieces) options as your protein.   I'd stay away from the tofu and order the veggies if meat isn't your thing. The tofu is a bit bland and uninspired :/ Other than this small downside you can't really go wrong. Order an egg and some cheese for added yumminess!",

You can customize what you want and I ended up getting a chicken katsu curry with corn and cheese. The curry is slightly sweet and the chicken katsu is pounded thin with a panko crust.   You can also add in spice from level 1-10 (10 being the spiciest). I chose 2 and it had a slight spice - spicy enough but not as spicy where you're sweating and turning red. The server told us that level 2-3 is considered medium spice but I feel that's subjective. I can't imagine how spicy level 10 is!  Service was okay but understandable. It seemed like they were understaffed with only two servers in the front of the house but only one was actually competent.   As a side note, they offered a flavored sake jello drink which was super interesting. You could pick different flavors but I ended up choosing peach. It was something I've never had and loved - soft jello with a sparkling peach sake. You have to try this drink!",

They're fast and efficient of getting people in and out, but wished the service was a little better.  Not once did our server check on us if we were ok or needed anything else.   The check was given without asking if we wanted dessert... the mango cheesecake sounded good, but sadly we didn't get the chance.     Advice:  don't forget to add the Fukujin red pickles since they don't come with the curry.  And the Takoyaki is a must!",

    "text": "Curry Fact: His full name is Wardell Stephen Curry II.  Oh wait, wrong \"Curry.\"  Oh well.  Here at Curry Zen, their recipe is comprised of over ten different spices. Each of the spices has their own unique holistic qualities such as warming of the bode, aiding in cell turnover, improving appetite, alleviating fatigue, and acting as an anti-oxidant. Very cool!  This place reminds me of California's Curry House. All they need is some corn pottage soup and they would be set! I had the Croquette Curry and added Kurobata Sausage. I also got to try the Japanese Meatloaf Curry with the addition of Spam. Both were at Level Two spice and both were extremely satisfying. It was the perfect way to start our trip in Vegas and I would not hesitate coming back. I love making Japanese curry at home but Curry Zen is so much more convenient. If only they had a location in Arizona! I also had the peach sparkling sake jelly drink. It was interesting but I wouldn't get it again.  It's a small cozy eatery that fills up fast. The staff here work efficiently with no extra fuss. I like it! I want to come back and try my curry with cheese!  Note: Pass on the takoyaki.",

Luckily, we were seated right away! The staff here were very welcoming and provided excellent service.   The wife and I shared the classic Chicken Katsu Curry ($9.95) with a spice level of 5 (scale of 1 to 10). We had just eaten at Monta Ramen and walked over here to try it out. The food came out scorching hot, so we knew it was freshly made. The curry here is thick, flavorful, and has a slight hint of sweetness to it. I don't really care for the sweetness, but that's just me. The presentation is a little boring since it doesn't come with any toppings. But it's a simple dish that will easily fill you up. Give it a try!",

There were people waiting outside to dine there so that was what struck his interest. I love curry so I was down to give them a shot. Usually busy restaurants have good food and in this case, it was True.   When we arrived, the place was busy with their lunch rush. Something we accounted for before coming because my friend had to go straight to the airport to catch his flight after lunch. It didn't take long to get seated. We had a chance to look at the menu while waiting so we knew what to order.   I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry with Cheese and Spinach Level 10. Portions were good but the curry wasn't spicy at all. I really enjoyed my meal even though the spice was disappointing. We washed down our meals with a couple of beers. What an awesome meal to send him off on. Great spot and I'll be back next time I'm craving curry in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've only had Japanese curry once in downtown Los Angeles but Zen beat that meal by a mile.  I like that they have you pick the spiciness you want.  When I ordered the chicken cutlet curry, I asked for a spice level of 7.  My server was a bit hesitant and suggested perhaps 4 and asked if I liked spicy food.  I stayed with the 7.  Next time I'll get 8.    The servers enter your order on a tablet so the order is sent to the kitchen from your table.  I was brought a glass of water which was refilled once.  It took about 5 minutes and the curry was brought to the table.  Besides the basic curry, chicken, and rice, I added the topping of cheese and a fried egg.  Mixing the curry, cheese, and egg into the meat and the rice was my first step in enjoying this meal.  Once that was done, I took my spoon and started to enjoy the dish.  The spice level was OK.  It had a nice tang to it but it could have been spicier.  The chicken is breaded with just the right amount and cooked so that no knife is needed.  The spoon broke the chicken pieces quite nicely.  A couple of things:  this is a small restaurant so you may have a wait.  There is a sign in sheet at the door when you enter.  This plaza is filled with Asian restaurants and parking can be a pain.  Luckily, I found an empty spot.  I'll be back.  It's close to Las Vegas Little Theatre where I often go and I'll stop here for dinner again!",

    "text": "The pork katsu was very juicy and my veggies in the curry had the right springy done-ness. And, yes the curry does have a nice depth of flavor. That is where all the good stuff tapers off. Yelp has this place listed as one $ but with 2 people, sharing 1 drink, our bill was $48. If you get the basic chicken katsu its one $, the rest, and I mean THE REST is all EXTRA. I ordered spicy level 5 and my friend ordered 8.  Our spicy levels were extra charges and it gets more expensive the spicier you get! I think  spice level 8 is 35 cents extra. Which reminds me, they switched our spice levels and I was almost crying trying to eat my curry while his had almost no spice...we were in no mood to voice our concern as we were just hungry. The takoyaki felt a bit under done, the 'meatloaf' is more like a soft burger patty and cheese and corn cost 75 cents extra, each.... not worth the extra price (the corn was COLD). Over all I would love it if I could just get the curry sauce to go and fend for myself. Oh and the 16 grain rice was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G if you like rice similar to the purple Korean rice. *TIPS - Don't go when it's busy (we went when it was slow and still felt a bit rushed) AND tell your mom you love her.",

    "text": "First off, I LOVE Japanese Curry & usually go to the one on Rainbow but coming to this location was the one of the worst decisions I've made. I came with a party of 9, and everything seemed to go smoothly. Most of us ordered then those who came about 10 minutes later ordered after. Cool, we're waiting and plates begin to come slowly. But my sister and I noticed that the two curry udons that we ordered weren't coming out, but we waited patiently. EVERYONE else got their plates and the waiter & waitress mentioned nothing about the udon. So I asked them about it and they just said \"oh,\" so the two udon bowls come out and they're watery? Apparently my sister likes that but everytime I've gone to the other location, it was nice THICK curry. In addition, I ordered a spicy level 6 and it was not spicy AT ALL. Maybe they forgot about it and rushed it? Who knows.. But whatever, we were just hungry and wanted to eat then go home. So we ask for the bill, and mind you, we previously mentioned that we were going to pay separately.. We wait about 10 minutes for her to bring the check, then she tells us to write numbers so that we can tell her how we split it. So I did and I handed it back. We wait 20 more minutes for the bill to come out and she separated it by entree saying that she has no time to split it the way I wrote it and said to just combine the paper checks and she'll ring it up like that. So she brings back the cards about 5 minutes later and my card is no where to be found then mentions that there is a $8 minimum AFTER the fact that most of our party paid. Luckily my sister, whose bill was only around $12, was able to combine their checks because there was a complication. So I bring their check back to the register area because the waiter & waitress didn't bother to check on us. I ask for my card and our server, Yuki, told us that she didn't know where my card was. So whatever, it stacked at the bottom of the trays. She told me to sit at my table because she didn't have time to ring me up right there. We waited longer. So she brought my check back along with my sister's.. My bill was fine but as for my sister's, she was charged for more than what she was supposed to pay for. Her bill was only supposed to be around $18, but they charged her almost double that amount. Wtf? I was fed up with this place. Yuki told me that I was supposed to say we were splitting it, which I did, and that they're too busy so she couldn't take care of us and we must wait. So another person comes in later on, named Yuta, and he clarifies and resolves the issue. But apparently we still had unpaid entrees on our check so what did she change the other people? We put the exact checks with our form on payment in separate trays so she couldn't get mixed up? The other waiter didn't even bother to help us. Should've eaten at Hwaro or Monta Ramen instead.  All in all, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Would not recommend this location. Go to the one of Rainbow if you want to be charged the right amount and want good service.",

The other things on the menu are okay, but the reason to come here is a big plate of curry rice.  Some tips if you're new to Japanese curry rice: - Don't use chopsticks. In Japan it's always eaten with a spoon. Plus it's impossible to get enough of the delicious rich curry sauce with chopsticks. - Get a topping. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) is traditional, but I love the chicken katsu. Try to get a bit of rice, curry sauce, and topping in every spoonful. - Add a spicy level. The base sauce is complex and tasty, but even a level 1-2 spicy (out of ten) adds more depth without much heat. (If it helps to calibrate, it takes a level 5 spicy to get my nose running.)   It's super busy right at the lunch and dinner hour, but has immediate seating the rest of the time. (If you have to wait, stop by Kung Fu Tea next door.) With all the businesses in a little square, parking is tight most of the time, but well worth it.",

A guy next to us got a number 10 and wasn't phased, I don't know how he was eating it lol. Definitely try the takoyaki here too! It's delicious. For the curry, I usually get the chicken katsu with additional beef but I recently tried the 5 piece kushi and it was great! It was skewers of fried mushrooms, quail eggs, shrimp, zucchini, and chicken katsu. It's nice if you want a good variety! Don't forget to ask for the pickled ginger. It helps balance out all that spiciness! I have to remember to save room next time for their green tea cheesecake which looked amazing! Their service has been consistently great and fast whenever we've come. Give it a try if the line at monta is too long! Lol",

Mobile filled with numbers of people called \"the hot one\", \"the hot hot one\", \"the hottest one\".  Enter Japanese Curry Zen; cure for a hangover and tragically lighter money clip.  The dish is simple.  Rice with plain curry topped with mostly deep fried goodies.  Ordering: 1.  Choose the size:  small $3.75, regular $5.95, or extra rice plus $1.00. 2.  Choose the heat level (this is Japanese not Thai.  J-Level 10 = T-Level 4 AND the taste is altered). 3.  Select toppings (braised beef, chicken, pork or tofu katsu, deep fried shrimp, potato croquette, or vegetables); $2.00 - $6.50. 4.  Done.  Typical Japanese curry (viscous, vegetable base with a complex, aromatic blend of Indian spices and a gentle heat).  No coconut milk, no painful chilies in the mix.  Everyday quality short grain white or brown rice.  The braised beef, tender, fall apart goodness.  The fried items, crunchy on the outside, correctly cooked on the inside.  The veg, cooked to death, very soft and lending their flavor to the mix.  A single order of any topping is enough to fill most up.  Typical offering of pickled veg and raisins at the table.  Multiple visits, very consistent.  A simple meal, done right.",

The Panko breading on what I've tried so far is crispy, golden, and hot.  The curry itself-- so deep and flavorful; one of the most authentic places I've been to. The service is great and food comes out fast! Just be warned: I love eating spicy stuff but I mean a 3-5 is like \"burn your face off\" to me. Still, one of my favorites Japanese restaurants in Vegas!",

    "text": "Craving Japanese Curry? Stuck on the strip? Get in a cab over to this place, stat.  This place is relatively cheap, depending on what you order...  - Chicken Curry Katsu: Sizable piece of chicken katsu, nicely breaded, loads of rice, flavorful curry. ~$9  - Pork Tender: If you're going to get pork, get the pork tender. It is MUCH greater than the regular pork katsu, and only a few dollars more. ~$12.50  - Spinach Curry: Yep, this is the real deal. It has a nice kick to it and is a fantastic option if you're not looking for any meat. ~$8  Waitstaff was attentive. The wait doesn't seem to be terribly long. Adding this to the complex probably makes this the best complex in vegas (Sweets Raku, Raku, and Monta Ramen)",

The fried shumai was so fried it barely had any life left but our son loved it. Of course. We all liked the Kushi Teri - was the favorite out of everything we ordered. The oyakodon was pretty average and had no complaints. The Katsu curry was lacking something in flavor but couldn't put my finger on it. Katsu itself was yummy and crunchy but I feel like I can make better curry at home... and my curry isn't even that great. This isn't to say it tasted bad, I think I was just expecting something better than what we got. Probably won't be back even though the service was pretty attentive and friendly.",

The moment I sat down, I noticed right away how clean the table was. It was so clean and shiny, it glistened under the fluorescent lighting.   They have a very limited menu consisting of several fried meat/protein options to go with your rice curry. I got to taste the vegetable curry, chicken and quail curry as well as my dish, the tofu curry. I think my favorite is the vegetable curry since it was the most flavorful out of the three. I also tried the coffee jelly and loved it! All of the items we ordered were very very delicious and well deserved the high ratings from everyone.   Come here if you're in the mood for some comfort food. Don't forget to try the yellow (medium spicy) spice mix on the table. It smelled so darn good I wish I could take the whole bottle home.",

The sauce is thick and flavorful, and it's a great cure for a hangover. This restaurant is reasonably priced because the food has good quality. The rice is not cheap and mushy. I love it.

So delicious. One of our party was allergic to peanuts, and as they use peanut oil, was unable to eat.

    "text": "I don't understand why it's 4 and a half stars. This place does not taste like real Japanese curry. I could have made a better one at home with a pre-made curry base. Even my mother in law from Japan stated that it tasted like they used pre-made powder to make the curry. The dish was not presentable either. The dish looked really plain. They didn't serve any side salad like Curry House, which they serve a small side salad and corn soup along with the curry. The service was not great either. When we arrived, we waited for over 30 minutes for a table of 3 even though there was a table of 2 open, which I didn't think we would be seated there anywase because it would not fit all three of us. When a table opened up, they split the table to serve the 3 of us and a group of 4 people that came much later. They seated us on a table that was originally for only 2 people while the group behind us sat at a bigger table that seated for 4. My husband mentioned that they could have just seated us at the other small table of 2 that was open the whole time we waited the 30 minutes rather than wait 30 minutes to be seated at a different small table of 2. We asked why we couldn't have the bigger table for 4 even though we had 3 people and they responded that they wanted to seat the bigger group at the same time as us. We waited over 30 minutes for our seats while this other group that literally came through the door waited no more than 5 minutes. I also didn't like how the waiters had to squeeze past my seat to get to the other tables because I was seated on the side of the small tiny table that was really only for table of 2. I had to squeeze myself as close to the table as possible for the waiters to have some space to pass me. I really tried my best even though I was pregnant. We had a difficult time eating at this small table with our big plates. I'm pretty clumsy so I'm glad that I didn't drop my dish or water. I will never come back to this place and I recommend that you do the same!",

Portions are a little small for the money and no veggies to go along with the meal. We ordered the sausage (tiny hot dogs) with brown rice and chicken katsu with brown rice. About an hour later, we were hungry again and had to satiate our hunger with a nice order of Carne Asada Nachos from Faustos. I wish they would offer options for veggies, pasta, and a hamburger patty.  One the plus side, the staff here is SUPER nice.",

    "text": "First off, I need to say I am not exactly a fan of Japanese curry. I prefer Thai curry over Japanese curry. With that said, I'll try and write this review as best I can based on the Japanese curry that I've had.  Japanese Curry Zen is actually a really nice/cozy place. It's small, so I suggest you go there during 'off' hours to avoid potential waits. The ordering process was fairly easy. A simple menu and a selection of additional meats to add on without putting a hole in your wallet =] The wait time for the food was normal, and the portions were decent. My friend ordered the pork cutlet and I ordered the chicken cutlet with a side of sausages. The sausages and the chicken cutlet was REALLY yummy. My friend's pork was slightly overcooked, and therefore was a bit harder to chew. The curry itself blended in really well, and I believe it was one of the best tasting Japanese curry I've tried =]  On each of the tables were two types of seasoning, some pickled ginger (i think it was ginger), and some PICKLED GARLIC... I haven't seen a place that served pickled garlic on the side in AGES!  I would definitely come back again, for a quick yet filling meal =]",

They have all the ingredients to have a successful delicious curry joint. Fried meats, a pretty tasty curry recipe, and limited seating (the longer the wait, the more delicious the food). The restaurant itself is very small, so it might not be the best place for large groups.",

I feel so bad sometimes because I can and I have ate the whole jar before! I'm not sure what the red one is but based on flavor I think it is red daikon- japanese radish. The other one is pickled pearl onions. Oh and I love spicy anything and my first time here I ordered spicy level 6 (1-10) and omg it was really SPICY! I still ate it because it was sooo good but I had to have water and pickled daikon after each bite hence why I ate the whole jar once lol. Now I order level 3...which is STILL PRETTY SPICY but just the right amount for me.",

I tried the chicken cutlet curry and it was good. The curry sauce was really flavorful and not too spicy. The cutlet had a crispy batter and it was tender on the inside. The side pickled onion was my favorite. Sweet and a little sour, no lingering raw onions smell or taste.   My bf had the shrimp curry and it was also good. It was a good size shrimp and was not over cooked.   As what the other Yelpers mentioned on their reviews, I hope they add vegetable options in their menu. Veggie goes well with curry!  Decent price for this kind of food, amount of serving and location.",

The menu is pretty focused here.  For appetizer we ordered the tako yaki, which are fried balls of mixed squid pieces, tempura bitsies and vegetables.  There is a mayo-like sauce on top.  I was not a big fan, but my husband liked it very much.  It is a very traditional Japanese street food.   Then I ordered the spinach curry, my husband ordered the vegetable curry, and we split tofu katsu, which are panko crusted blocks of tofu.  Everything was extremely extremely delicious.  We only waited a few minutes for the table.  Other people with bigger parties were waiting longer.  There was no one really hosting guests, and there is no space inside to wait, so we all stood around for a while, until finally we started writing our names on the pad and waiting outside.  You can request the spice level you want from 1 to 10.  I ordered a 2, and it was medium spicy.  I told the waiter a 6, and he said, \"6 is not medium.  2 is medium.\"  And he was right. The entrees were about $10 apiece.",

The chicken cutlet was cooked perfect.   It very juicy, crispy, and flavorful.   The service was great.  The server was very attentive and checked on us a few times.

At Japanese Curry Zen, I experienced great service, just as many other reviewers have, but the chicken cutlet I ordered was dry and bland, and the curry wasn't anything extraordinary. I understand that CoCo's is a franchise and it wouldn't be fair to compare this local dine-in to it, but I've also had better curry at other local Japanese/Island restaurants for half the price.  They DO serve a mini bowl, so if you just want to try it, go ahead and order that instead.",

My only complaint would be that I think the curry and the chicken/pork katsu I ordered with it could use more salt.  If you want to under salt them for peoples' tastes that's fine, I guess, but put salt shakers on the table. I was a little surprised you don't get the veggies in the curry that I'm used to.  Also, didn't see an option for some sort of veggie in the curry.  Guess you have to order a salad. Still...this is just quibbling.  This place is delicious.  If you like Japanese Curry, and you'd be crazy not to, this place will be on your regular spots of places to eat.",

I also love getting the veggie curry. Nice add-ons include spinach or cheese (Additional charge)! You can also adjust the spicy level, which ranges from 1-10 (Additional charge). I would prefer getting a MINI plate. It's just enough to fill you up, and it is cheaper. And if you're not a fan of curry, the Katsu-Don would be my go-to!",

Right off the bat, the menu says if you have any allergens (especially peanut allergies) to let your waiter know. I avoid the curry because it is made with peanut oil, but from what my friends say, it's pretty great.   What I always get is the Katsu-Don, with the egg cooked well done. Usually, the egg in the dish is served undercooked or runny. Because of food allergies, I'm only able to eat cooked egg so I really appreciate the staff being able to make the egg adjustment for me so I can eat here with my friends. In the past, I've ordered the Chicken Katsu with rice, no curry, and that was good as well. However, I prefer the Katsu-Don better, probably because it's a bit different than what I'd normally order when eating out.",

Come at me again.   Tired of asking for more and more spice, I ask for 50. The waiter looks at me, trying to talk me out of it. I swear, at one point he ran over to ask if everything was okay. I'll be honest, 50 gave me sweats.... wiping my brow and running nose. Finally spicy enough for me!  Unfortunately, it tasted like garbage. Instead of a deliciously smooth and flavorful curry, it tasted like chalk. Moral of the story, even if you can handle a 50, don't get it! There's more powder than curry. It would probably be really tasty if they used a spicier pepper instead of more and more of their standard spice.   That's not their fault though, Zen is delicious if you're sane and order a regular level of spice ;)",

Their rich curry sauce is good alone or with a protein and they even offer brown rice as an option. When I don't feel like curry , I opt for a tofu katsudon which is always full of flavor and prepared well. Tip: ask for extra pickled onion on the side!   While I've never had any additional spice (partially because part of me doesn't want to pay an extra 20-cents), I see that everyone else in the review enjoys the spice added. I do enjoy a frosty mug of asahi once in a while and it is priced fairly. Otherwise, you can try the cheesecake.   I tend to come early to not have to wait in line, but if you're seated right away, you can take your lunch break here.",

Zen Curry is always a great fall back for when the wait at the near by KBBQ and/or Ramen restaurants are too long. Portion sizes are great for the price you pay and the service is always quick. A couple of the side dishes are pretty bland but there's enough yummy alternatives that I'm willing to fill my belly with.  My go-to order is the chicken curry with cheese spicy level 4 (out of 10) with a side of shumai. I'm also slightly obsessed with their water. The water is always extremely crisp and refreshing. Either they have a really good water filter or I just live in desert so I'm always thirsty. Stay hydrated folks!",

Their most popular entree is the pork katsu and most popular add on's are cheese and corn. I'm pleased to find out that they serve have sizes for less than $4! For someone who can't usually finish their food, it's a good portion size and additional $3-4 for meat. It's not the best curry I've had but it does fulfill my craving for it.",

The husband cleaned his plate while I was still working on my big bowl of white seasoned chicken chunks and scrambled egg and sauteed onion atop the generous bowl of rice. Perfectly seasoned !  The pile of dried bonito flakes atop the five takoyaki balls were still writhing on its platter. Love the food selection, quality, fresh ingredients, friendly and prompt service, and the clean friendly atmosphere.",

We also had the curry udon which had bits of pork in it and had a nice consistency to the broth. We shared some takoyaki balls too which were crisp on the outside with creamy center and a bit of chew from the octopus.

The selections of add ons are very good including cheese, sausage, katsu and a lot more.  My friend and I came in to have lunch and ordered different styles of curry. I ordered the Spinach Curry with Kushi at a level 6, which is above the average. It was so good! My friend ordered the Spinach Curry too but with cheese and the Kurobuta Sausage, it looked really good. I might try that next time.   The nice thing about this place is you can create your own curry plates from the type of rice, the spice level of curry and your toppings. The servings are big and very filling. I thing this place is great and the prices are on point for the amount of food you are served. Yum... I cannot wait to try out the other locations and curry combinations!",

In a city oversaturated with bad Japanese food, Curry Zen is a breath of fresh air. It may not be the traditional preparation of curry (more vegetables and meat), but the options they give you are delicious. Getting the level 5 curry with croquette and kurobuta sausage is absolutely divine. Additionally, the curry pan is super good. The filling is fantastic with a blend of vegetables inside and is fried to a crunchy perfection. I would recommend everyone to come here!",

The chefs and the servers are all japanese people and their curry tastes just like you would have in Japan.  Their Chicken Katsu tastes so good, when combined with their Medium Spicy Curry. It is tender, crispy, and full of flavor.  For less than $10, you do get a lot of food. It's pretty filling. Their curry is amazingly good, great portion size for a good price.  I am glad other places were full. If not, I wouldn't have had the chance to come and try this place out.",

To top it all off, the pickled ginger on the side. I started getting the spinach curry and let me tell you.. LIT  If the curry is too overwhelming, you can ask for it on the side and they'll give it in a separate bowl. There's a lot of things to add on like extra cutlet of katsu, spam, fried egg. You can experiment each time you go here until you find your dream curry.   The downside to this place is, they're always short on staff & this place gets so busy!! I wish they kept the pickled ginger and a pitcher of water at the tables because it's so hard to chase down a worker since they're always busy. Also, the average time on waiting on your check is like 6-10mins. The last time I was here, the waitress dropped a couple plates and some curry splashed on my friend's pants and shoes. She didn't acknowledge it, no apology, which was disappointing.",

I have to say, if one were to compare them to Thai, Indian, or other curries I've had in the past, Japanese curry seemed more bland and thick, almost like a gravy.  They had plenty of seasoning shakers on the table though, so a few sprinkles of extra hot woke up the dish, and it was very enjoyable!  We tried a little bit of everything here, with Cathy ordering the Pork cutlet, Chicken Cutlet, Kurobuta Sausage and Croquette for us to try. It was cooked well, with lots of juicy meat and great flavor in the breading.   This place is super tiny, so not for the claustrophobic...but a great place to get some good eats for not much money!",

Real good curry made by a real Nihonjin, not Mr. Lee or Pedro ( no offense meant, but this place is legit!)  There are a variety of delicious things to go with your curry and rice.  I did the tonkatsu, which is my standard go to. Crispy, moist, not greasy.  Wife had the Japanese meatloaf, which was moist and flavorful.   Young guys at table next to us did 3 things with their curry. If I had the metabolism of years past, I would have done that too!  I did level 8 out of 10 for hotness. Just right. Made my nose run, but my eyes stayed dry.   This small place, which can seat maybe 35, is a must do for curry lovers. And if you're on the fence about curry due to the MSG laden, S&B block instant curry you've tried, give this place a try. You will be glad you did!",

The BF and I split our meat toppings of a pork katsu and a tofu cutlet. Pork katsu was crisp and still juicy (which a lot of pork katsus are not). Tofu cutlet was crisp, but still light and was of the silky/soft tofu variety which I much prefer over firm kinds. Curry itself was pretty decent though standard. It's solid for here, but not the best I've had though. I like all the garnishes they set on your table which some curry houses do not do...At least for me, I've never noticed raisins and almonds at other places. Not their fault, but I wish they had my favorite curry topping : an egg. It would really make me a fan. Something about curry rice and egg is perfect.   We had the coffee jello which was nice, and refreshing to the palette after curry. Halfway eating the waitress asked if we would like more cream for the jello which was a small, but very considerate touch. Really, she was kind and attentive throughout.   I'm a fan of this place for the humble service you come to expect from Japanese and feel It's a solid and quick lunch plate option.",

I've tried both chicken and pork katsu curries but I prefer the chicken curry (don't get me wrong both are great). I only wish they had katsu fish (only because fish is my ultimate protein source)!   Specials: Although it cost $0.20 extra for spicy levels 6-10, it's definitely worth getting some fire on the curry. I've tried spicy levels 7 and 8, and 8 is definitely hotter (my lips were burning and my stomach a little bit churning). Level 7 spicy is perfect for me with just enough heat! Almonds! Add thinly sliced almonds inside the curry for crunchy texture and because the almonds are so thinly sliced they do not contribute or detract from the curry flavor.  Service: The service is excellent. I believe all the house staff are native Japanese but we didn't really have a language barrier and ordering was really easy. They are quick on their feet and make sure our waters are always refilled and they check in on you often. The food comes out quickly so I definitely recommend this spot for quick eats.  Final Impression: I have to admit, this is my favorite katsu + curry house ever.",

The only downside i can think of is that their spiciness varies from day to day. I usually get the level 1 or 2 but sometimes the level 1 would be really spicy and other times not spicy at all. Parking is also hard to find but that's more because of the location and other businesses around it. I love coming to this place though and will always pickup some late night dinner for co-workers when working overnights",

This is one of our MUST GO PLACES every time we travel to Vegas!! This is even better than any curry places we have gone to in LA at Little Tokyo...its seriously that good!! You know some places have batter which tastes oily or gets worse throughout the day, there is zero salty or stale oil flavor here...actually there is zero oil flavor...the batter is so light and crisp day or night!! I also highly recommend their tofu salad, its so refreshing to your palate before you eat the Japanese curry...the pork is also super tender as well...there is really no going wrong but someone MUST get the tofu curry just so everyone can have a bite!!",

For appetizer, we ordered he Shumai, didn't really expect it to be so small for the price you pay for it, but nonetheless, it was good. We went about 2 hours closer to closing time, on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for a long time. The service was ok, took longer than expected to order but it was probably because we were sitting in the corner. The ambience was cute and quaint, definitely felt like you were in a Japanese restaurant from Japan. This place is located in a very popular little center, so parking can be a little tight but there is street parking available.",

The gyoza is always perfectly cooked and the croquette, which I just recently tried, is flavorful! Their tofu salad and the dressing are addictinggg!! Definitely a must try! As for dessert, the green tea cheesecake is heavenly. The slice is small but trust me, it's perfect and satisfying.  Now, the service is also great. There's a few servers that already recognize us every time we come in and they always greet us with a smile. They're very helpful and kind! Ill definitely continue my semi weekly visits :D",

    "text": "Located in the same plaza as Raku, Kabuto, and Monta, Japanese Curry Zen rounds out this wonderful menagerie of awesome eateries on Spring Mountain and Decatur.   This place is a bit small so if you if plan on coming with a group of 3+ there might be a bit of a wait during rush hour times. The bar is better suited to single eaters or 2-people groups. Still a fun, casual dining experience.  If you're doing curry, this place is a delicious choice! I ordered the base curry pork katsu ($9.45), with sausage ($2.50), corn ($0.50), and a spicyness level ($0.20). The pork katsu was perfectly crisp without being dry meat on the inside. Sausage was flavorful. Curry itself had depth and didn't taste like it came out of a box. Along with curry bread ($2), we couldn't get enough! Curry bread tastes like crack, but with curry and whatever magic is in there to make me salivate. Think pastry without the sugar and all savory goodness.  Prices are okay. You can see how it runs up pretty quickly per person. They charge quite a bit for toppings. $2.50 for three tiny sausages? Base curry is just rice with sauce and a little bit of meat all for $8-$10ish and you're still expected to get toppings? It'd be a pretty plain curry otherwise. Not as cheap as pho, but it's still pretty savory and a nice change of pace. After all the add-ons between my boyfriend and I, the bill came out to be $35ish.  Not exactly cheap for what you get, but hits the spot! Good place for a casual date night or hang-out with friends! We both left feeling pleasantly satisfied. You know food is wonderful and delectable when it stays with you on the ride home. (Well, obviously, because you just ate it.) But for instance, it just makes you feel happy like a cat on a lazy sunday.  Would come here again!",

I've never had Japanese style fried chicken with curry sauce. It looked interesting, so I decided to stop by.  I started out by ordering Ashi ($2.95/small glass). I ordered Toko-yaki (~$4) and fried shu-mai ($3.75). Toko-yaki was batter was good, but the octopus was bit too chewy. Fried shu-mai are really small, but they have good flavor and frying anything makes it great.   My main course meal was the chicken katsu with level 10 spicy curry. This might be the first restaurant to charge money to make things spicy (like I won't be paying a price next morning). When I the plate the curry sauce looked red hot (not sure if you can see it in the pic), but upon eating it I was bit disappointed with the spice level. However, I became a fan of this meal. I think this is the best way to eat a fried chicken. The chicken was tender and the batter was just the right amount. Rice and curry also complimented very well with juicy chicken. The price is also perfect $9 for the whole meal.   I will definitely be back for more. The only negatives I can say is that the TVs are tiny, and I wish the bathrooms didn't smell like someone had a curry explosion. The service is good and the servers take their time to explain the menu item if you are new.   Check out this place, it really is a gem, but stay away from their bathroom and bring a pair of binoculars if you want to watch a football game on their TV.",

Zen Curry also offers a delicious Katsu-Don (Donburi/Bowl), I wish they offered other types though, not just katsu. The toppings for your curry are endless and there are many different sides you can get with your meal. I recommend getting the tofu salad and the takoyaki to accompany your meal.  This location is definitely in a poor plaza. There are too many places packed around this two row parking lot. Don't let this scare you.

The fried shumai was wonderful. I'd go back for them alone. The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, exactly what I'd expect at a Japanese restaurant.

You cannot imagine what it is like until you actually eat it, but believe me, it's a popular food category in Japan.  My favorite is veggie curry with pork sausages. The pork sausage is a beloved \"schau-essen,\" if you know what I mean.  And yes, they offer brown rice too! Now you won't get sleepy even when you have a full belly.",

    "text": "Japanese Curry Zen is one of my favorite comfort food spots. I used to come here often when I worked on the strip, but now that our office has moved further east, it is now even that much more of an effort to get to Chinatown area and all of its great food. I guess you could say that it is not really that much of a drive from Henderson, but I digress...  I typically get the pork katsu curry with shrimp. Which doesn't seem like much, but that rice is really filling and pairs oh so well with the curry. Sometimes I don't get how something like plain rice can be so good when eaten with other foods. It just tastes like home.  On the spice level - I typically get level 1 which is perfect for me because I really don't do well with even slightly spicy things.",

    "text": "Small place located north west of Spring Mountain and Decatur intersection, in the same plaza as the popular Monta Ramen, Raku Japanese Grill, or the elegant Kabuto sushi.   Over the years, I haven't been much of a japanese curry lover but I will still eat it periodically. This place is small but is managed by a very friendly, welcoming staff.   Very small, defined menu highlighting their main focus, curry. Plain curry, chicken katsu curry, or pork katsu curry. Of course there are other things on the menu or add ons but in this review, i will not get into it. On the back of their menu, they list every, or almost every spice they use in the curry, as well as a brief description of each of what it does to help you (health wise)   On the table, there are 7 different bottles. Of course the normal salt and pepper, but they have 3 others. The normal 15 spice blend they use in the curry that gives a mild spiciness. As well as a medium and a hot blend of spices. The final 2 bottles are the usual red pickled ginger you see normally in japanese restaurants and i believe was pickled baby onions? not sure. What i had found out which was a nice touch was that they do NOT put the ginger on the side of the curry, where most restaurants do. I thought it was a nice touch because i am not much of a fan of ginger, overall.   This first, and only visit I have made (so far), i had ordered chicken katsu curry. Presented in a normal fashion. Round plate. 1/2 white rice. 1/2 katsu covered in the curry sauce.   Of course, first thing i would taste is the curry sauce. Nice brown color. Very smooth upon taste. Very flavorful. Can taste a lot of the spices but with a small kick from i believe either paprika or cayenne (i dont remember the list of spices they had listed). This place makes their curry sauce well.   Besides the curry sauce, of course they had the katsu. Wasn't too amazed by this though. It was cooked thoroughly, but maybe a little too long. Meat was dry and the thickness varied greatly on the piece of katsu. The breading was a bit stuff, and not \"loose\". Not sure how to describe it. What i believe to be a perfectly made katsu is an even thickness cut of meat either cut or pounded thin, breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried to a golden brown, long enough to be cooked but fast enough to still be juicy, as well as have a flaky crust.   Price pretty reasonable. $4.95 for the plain curry. Then additional $3 for chicken katsu, $3.50 for a pork katsu, and they had other things.   But aside from the katsu, maybe they are still correcting themselves on the timing, ill give them another chance in the future, the curry is great. probably the closest to genuine japanese curry you will find in Vegas for now. Good place to visit but remember, space is limited, to maybe.. 20ish seats total.",

    "text": "Came here last night for the first time with hubby & sister. Since it is my first time to try Japanese curry, I have nothing to compare it to.  However, here are the key points that I feel worth mentioning:  1) Ambiance:  The place is quiet when we got there and only has 2 other tables occupied. The place is clean and quite cozy.  2) Service:  It was great and food came fast.  3) Price:  I think it is quite pricey after putting the toppings that you want unless you only want the combinations they have on the menu. That's where the deduction of star came from.  4) Food:  Overall, the food was great! We ordered the following items:  *  Chicken Katsu + Sausage - Hubby ordered it and loved it. He got it at Level 2 spiciness and felt that's all he could go for as the spiciness lingers in your mouth according to him.  * Pork Katsu w/ Egg (Lvl 2 spiciness) - My sister ordered it and she felt that it was quite good and conparable to Curry House in Cali that she and her husband's family frequently go to get their Jap curry fix.  * Original Curry + Spam + Fried Oyster w/ corn - I ordered this with level 1 spiciness (can't handle too much heat).  I found my food very delicious specially the fried oysters. The burst of flavor when I had my first bite of the oyster with the curry sauce & rice. The best description on my food that I can come up with at that moment was \"It was orgasmic!\" Lol! I love to cook and have pretty good palate and the flavor of this was amazing. Even spam with the curry sauce was pretty good. I had leftover food that I brought home to my 16 y/o son and he enjoyed it as much as I did. He did agree that the fried oyster with the curry sauce was to die for.  We will definitely be back for sure.  I look forward to trying the spinach curry with fried tofu. Just writing this review makes me drool. Yum! Absolutely worth trying!",

The wait staff and one of the cooks (we couldn't really see the whole open kitchen so we weren't sure how many cooks there were) were Japanese so we took that as a promising sign of things to come. They serve Asahi draft beer which made us happy and also Sapporo beer. We decided to order the pork tender curry with cheese topping and white rice at spicy level 3. We usually go with spicy level 8 in Japan but the waiter warned us that anything more than 5 would be extremely hot. So to be safe, we opted for level 3. We were glad that we got level 3 because that already had a kick and anything beyond that would just make the curry overpoweringly spicy and ruin the taste for us. The curry was excellent. The pork was tender and delicious. The cheese topping sealed the deal for us. We came out of Japanese Curry Zen \"tummy-happy\" that we found a slice of Japanese curry heaven in Vegas!",

My favorite part is when I order veggies I actually get big chunks of veggies that appear to be fresh. Other places it is the mixed frozen vegetables which are tiny and that's why it's obvious they were the frozen ones. The rice is cooked nicely, the red and white ginger are nice additions and I like that I can help myself and don't need to ask for it. A 2 or 3 is very hot, a 10 is I don't know, I never got it. I did see someone order it once though, wow. I like really spicy and a 3 is really spicy. I like seeing the list of health benefits listed for eating curry. The food comes fast to the table and has always been consistent. Menu is simple but nice.   I also like that the chef (assuming the owner, but maybe not) always thanks us for coming (at least that's what I think he is doing since he speaks in Japanese). :) If I had a wish, it was that a small salad came with the meal. I also wish for non fried items, since beef chunks is the only protein on the menu that is not fried.",

Fortunately, we were there at an odd time so there was no waiting for a table.  The food was terrific, and it was presented very nicely on the plate.  Curry sauce is the best that I have ever had.  The mixture of all their various spices creates an explosion of yummy flavor!  Their was an insert at our table, and I enjoyed reading all the health benefits that the different spices offer.  Very educational.  Also liked that you choose how spicy you want your curry to be.  The scale ranges from 1 (not spicy) to 10 (their spiciest choice).  I chose the #3 level, and it had a good kick for my taste buds.    I am happy that we were referred to Japanese Curry Zen.  If I lived in Las Vegas, they would be part of my dining out rotation.  Very very nice option!",

If you've never had Japanese curry, you need to try this joint.  My friend and I were looking for a place to dine and to chat a little and we decided to go here. As we've never had curry before, it was interesting to us. The area is small and they have about 20 seats, it doesn't have a patio, so it's not comfy for large groups, but for two or three people it is perfect. The service is pretty good, it took about 15 min. to get our order. The prices are reasonable.  I went for the pork cutlet curry and my friend went for the chicken. Both were very well prepared with a nice gold crust. Very yummy:) Now I can say that this is an excellent cooked home style food and after trying this food we became curry fans)))",

The sausage curry should not belong on the menu. I'm sorry but it doesn't look like something that should be served at a 4-5 star restaurant. It's literally pieces of cut sausage covered in their curry sauce. Usually less is more, and this is a prime example!  Next, the katsudon is advertised as their prime dish, even stating it as the house dish on their menu if I remember correctly. For something that is their house dish, it was nothing special. In fact, I recommend their standard chicken curry instead. I feel like newcomers to the restaurant or even newbies to curry-eaters in general may not enjoy the katsudon. It's a little soggy and on the bland side.  I like their chicken curry especially with the cheese and corn toppings. The curry, rice and chicken were all on point. I have to say the curry is very flavorful, go to a 7 or 8 if you're around that number with thai food.  Service is friendly and prompt, food is great but I only stick with the curry chicken.",

I usually get the chicken katsu, but after trying the croquette, I will be getting that from now on. Had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and inside was moist and flavorful. You can ask for extra toppings of meats for extra, and get pickled onions, radish, almonds, and raisins for free. Takoyaki appetizer is worth a try.  Their portions are quite large, but they do have a \"small plate\" option of just the curry and rice for $3.75, which is a perfect size for me.",

The past few times i've visited the employee-customer interaction was incredibly low and we constantly had to flag down the employees for simple items that i've already asked for previously or they just drop the food off and never come back again.",

    "text": "This Japanese curry place was recommended to us by our brother and fellow elite yelper. We are so glad we tried it. It was easy to find. It's a few minutes from the strip. When we walked in, it smelled like curry heaven. The host/waiter greeted us right away with a Japanese greeting and seated us. The restaurant was about half full. They had a booster highchair for our toddler.   The menu isn't too complex which was nice. I ordered the vegetable curry with no mushrooms and my husband got the chicken katsu curry. We both got 3 for the spicy level. It was $0.20 per meal to add a level 3 spice. The spicier you add, the more it costs but the max spicy level was still under $1. The waiter mentioned that the 3 would probably be too spicy for our toddler, and I told him he'd probably just eat the rice anyway. I thought that was very considerate of him to mention that.   The food came out in an expected amount of time. We both took one bite of our meals and were so pleased with how our curry tasted. It was pretty spicy at first but then not too bad. My mouth was burning though. I'd probably get a 2 next time. Good thing we had ice water nearby (which was a little slow to be refilled but that's ok - my husband said that's how it is in Japan haha).   I tried my husband's meal and LOVED the crunchy, breaded outside and tender, moist inside of the chicken. I wish they would do a chicken and vegetable curry dish. That would be perfect. The meal portions were huge! We were very full afterwards and I couldn't finish mine.   Overall, it was $25 including the tip. We hope to be back down this way soon so we can eat here again. Someone needs to open one of these in Utah county!",

    "text": "Basically in love with going to this place! curry Zen gives me that warm feeling (no pun intended) that I can't get at many other places. My friends and I have been frequenting this place for almost a year now and I couldn't be happier that I was introduced to this location since. I'm not the pickiest eater but I love a good presentation and a good selection. This place however, is GREAT. They have adjusted their menu/style since I first started coming here and prior that I didn't believe the place could get any better.  Their wait staff has changed over the course of time and I'm honestly happier about that. Their staff from the past couple of months are noticeably more attentive, friendlier, and I always get the vibe that they're happy to be here. As busy as it gets, I'm appreciative that the service never seems weary and gives the place such an amazing atmosphere.  About the food: AWESOME. I always get the tofu katsu curry, with or without extras. This time I got 4pcs extra and I was super happy about this. Lately I've been ordering their jelly vodka.. And they're usually out of the berry option but the wonderful waitress suggested the Yuzu option. Tasted great! It's hard to find a place that knows how to pair their drinks with their food so well. Usually it's random and doesn't seem to fit. But I have the best time with their selection. Final thoughts are that I can't wait to go back! I highly recommend Japanese Curry Zen to anyone who is looking for a great dinner or lunch!",

    "text": "A lot of service workers tend to enjoy their job (or at least they pretend to) especially in front of their customers. That was not the case this evening. We were with friends from out of town and said, with pride, that there is a great curry place to check out. The other staff was great, the food was great, but the quality of service was the lowest by far.  The male server greeted us by saying, \"Just so you know, we can only split the check in four ways.\" I thought that was an odd version of \"Welcome to Japanese Zen Curry. What can I get you?\" He was very short with our friends when they were trying to decide what to order, did not offer suggestions, and spoke very monotone and had the facial expression like he was contemplating throwing himself out of the window of a moving vehicle. While I was ordering, I was looking over the side dishes to add to my curry plate. As I often do, I speak while I think and the server mistook it as me ordering and said, \"Can you speak up? I can't hear you.\" I told him I wasn't telling my order and he exhaled like he was in hurry.  We received our food (only reason for the 2-star rating) and it was great as usual. Another server offered to print out individual receipts so we can group the payment in three instead of four per request of Mr. Sunshine to help clarify the order. Before we knew it, he comes to our table scolding us saying, \"I TOLD YOU WE CAN ONLY SPLIT IN FOUR.\" I had enough at this point and responded, \"You have three cards in your hands. We only want it three ways.\" When I offered to tell him that we can group it for him, his response was, \"I don't know what you ordered!\" I can see the awkward looks on our friends' faces so I stood up and had to spell out for him how to charge us.  After signing our bills, he comes over and asks, \"Do you need anything else?\" I laughed. And i said, \"Nope.\" And he walks away. I don't know if he was forced to work or a family member died, but he does not belong there. I hope the owner or the friendlier staff members speak about his rudeness. Get some sleep, guy.",

I'm def not a curry expert but I like the food here.  Food -katsu curry- yum, the curry goes great with katsu and rice. I like how the katsu isn't breaded too thickly. The only drawback is they don't give you that much katsu, and there are no vegetables.  -katsu don- good flavor with a decent amount of food. Meat was a little dry though  -tako yaki- yum  Service- service is usually good, friendly waiters who do their best to accommodate you. I like how they split the bill for you.   Environment- nice and clean, fair amount of tables. Parking lot is small and crowded though.   Overall, this place gave me a new perspective on curry. They offer good food and service.",

After my wife had recently visited Japan she had a craving for curry.  Zen was busy but the wait wasn't too long.  I ordered the Tonkatsu  (breaded pork) curry and an order of Tacoyaki.  The Tonkatsu looked very simple.  The breaded pork was side by side with white rice and the curry gravy was liberally spilled over both.  The pork was delicious and crispy and the curry had a nice spice and all in all it was so awesome!  Takoyaki is a Japanese snack that is in the form of a ball.  In the middle of the deep fried dough ball is a small piece of octopus.  If you come to Zen don't miss out on the Takoyaki, it was so good!  Over all, I loved this place.  My wife even said that Zen Curry was very close to the curry shops she ate at in Japan.  This is a must go in Las Vegas!",

As another reviewer stated, this place is as similar to Japan's CoCo Ichiban as you can get in mainland America. I've missed this food since I left Japan, so I had the chicken cutlet curry with an extra pork cutlet, and it was exceptional in every way.  The great thing about this place is that your meal can can be as gargantuan as you'd like if you add extra toppings, though the typical serving of rice, curry, and one meat is enough.  The service was very attentive as well, which I'm sure will continue as people discover this gem.   I'm expecting this place to become the Monta of curry, so enjoy the lull while it lasts. The word WILL get out, and this place definitely deserves more business.",

My friends couldn't handle their spiciness \"3\" and the waitress took it back and remade their food less spicy. The chef came out to make sure it was okay and he was really friendly about it and a fantastic sport. As someone that generally can't handle spicy, a 2 was perfect for me.

But this place is a very good place for curry. Given the selection in Vegas it's probably one of the best. I've been here more than a few times if that tells you anything. The curry is pretty good and consistent in flavor each time. I really like the curry udon but my girlfriend thinks it's only ok. But hey when do couples ever agree. It's a pretty good place and it will definitely take care of your curry craving.",

I have never tried a curry pan but it looked good in the picture so I ordered it. My order was to go and usually other places put your freshly fried food in the to go box and by the time you get home it is all soggy.  The merry chef at Japanese Curry Zen was so thoughtful and makes sure he let's the fried pieces set and crisp before he packs it  so when you get home they are still absolutely delicious and chrisp. The order was meant to be my dinner but when I got home I just wanted a little spoon full of curry to try it out. I ended up eating my whole order right then and there! It was so good I had to finish eating everything! Man the chef knows how to cook. Curry master!!",

My friends and I would often come here because we wanted to support the restaurant, so I'm really glad that it is as successful as I would have imagined it to be.  There aren't many specialty restaurants in Vegas that have Japanese curry as their selling point and that's why I think Curry Zen is good for Vegas. It is unique and it is different from what we already have here. If you've never tried Japanese curry before, I say go here for your first time. The curry sauce is creamy and very tasteful and the way they cook their meat is perfection. This is definitely authentic Japanese curry. I've been to Japan a few times before and when I eat curry there, it reminds me of Curry Zen and makes me miss the restaurant. They have a bigger selection of Japanese curry now (as compared to when they started when they only have about 10-15 dishes) so you'll definitely find something that you like. The customer service here is as good as it gets as well. Sure, it gets busy from time to time and they forget to refill your water but you can see genuine smiles from the server that never seem to disappear. The owners also walk around to see how you are doing, which I think makes it such a personal and inviting restaurant.   They have a nice selection of desserts and non-curry food as well, so if you're not into Japanese curry, you can always try other selections that they have.  All in all, Curry Zen is definitely worth a shot. If you've never been here before, try it. I'm sure you'll be a regular like me before you know it.",

Having said the 8 year old in our dinning party was quite content with the chicken cutlet and rice, hold the sauce.  Go figure.  My pork cutlet level 4, met my curry craving with high marks. Now to work my way up the ladder of heat. 1-9.  A 4 got my nose running lol.  2-3 level should be fine for medium fans.  The staff said the difference between 4 and 5 is more than the other steps.

At first I thought it was going to be too mild, but by the end of the meal my nose was running and my mouth was pleasantly hot.  It was very busy at lunch--the place seats something like 35 and the one waitress was just about overwhelmed--but they kept the dishes coming out at a steady pace.

My answer? 8 more than we needed :)  At first menu glance all we see is deep fried. Unfortunate.  Low and behold we see a beef and sausage dish and after speaking to the server found out they made a grilled chicken too. Recommended.   Funny note. Picture of beef showed 4 pieces. We asked the server if the picture was accurate and he said there was actually 6 pieces. We were server 5.  Um ya. The server came back later with two more pieces.    The chicken katsu was good. Lots of rice with each dish. Don't order a side of corn as its about 2 tablespoons at most really? Give me the whole damn can! Lol   My favorite was the spinach. Go figure. Perfectly cooked. Right tenderness and not soggy. The mix it right in the curry.   The confusing part was the spice level. Regular was 1-5. Then they had a blazing option at 6-10.  I was told medium was between 1-5 so I ordered a 2.5 to be funny but the server wasn't amused. But smiled  :). Other friends had a 5 and I could barely tell the difference. We didn't order any 'blazing's so I could compare.   The owner came out again to greet us all after we finished and was very sweet. Tried to explain the difference in spice levels but I was already in a rice/ food coma.   The extra star to make it a 4 was their spice mix they leave on the table. I sprinkled it on my wrist prior to ordering and was in love. I added this to all my 'shared' plates.  They also had two hot spices one which looked like crushed red peppers and the other cayenne.",

I got mild spicy and I would rate that as a 4 out of 10. So for people that aren't into spicy, make sure to order extra mild. Spice is so tough to calibrate though, sometimes I order a 4/10 at a thai place and it comes out 6/10 and some other places when I order medium the spicy level is 3/10. Oh well, spicy is dependent on each cook too. So, just order what you think you can handle that day.  I had the veggie curry then added meat to it. I enjoyed that veggies in the curry a lot. I highly recommend that.",

Trust me...anything that stacks up to cheese buttons and klub is pretty freaking good.  The waitress and cook talked me down from a spice level 5 to a spice level 3.

    "text": "Real Japanese curry made by real Japanese people!  I always do a happy dance inside when I encounter this..  Just like in Japan, most restaurants the menu's are small and specialize in one type of dish; in this case curry.   Food Breakdown: I ordered tonkatsu curry.  The curry sauce itself is legit Japanese curry and was mild in spice and flavor.  They did offer pepper and other spices if you wanted to give it more oomph. This was different from the typical Nihon Curry-ya where they would ask you your spice (pain) tolerance level and add oomph accordingly. Boo on that :(  The curry had no sustenance; just sauce. A little carrots, onions or meat in the sauce would've gone a long way in my book.   I don't mind paying good money for good food however at a pricepoint of $9 for katsu curry it fell short and I left hungry.   I am glad to find a legit nihon curry-ya in Vegas so I'm sure I'll be back.",

It goes from 1-10, but be warned.. their spice is no joke! I usually go for level 2 or level 3. 2 is good enough for me, but 3 is when I want that feel that kick in there. Service is always great and fast. The servers really know how to move the customers along and they will quintuple seat tables at a time. I don't know how they keep up! Overall, this place is a must if you like Japanese curry. They even have vegetarian options such as spinach and egg, fried tofu, vegetable, and there's one more but I can't remember it. This is a place for all kinds of crowds. I must say though... Their portion size has decreased over the years. Oh! And go over to Kung Fu Tea afterwards for a dessert drink.",

Unfortunately, I thought Coco Ichibanya's meats were better since their beef is softer and their chicken is crispier/juicier than Curry Zen's.

I got there a little early compared to the rest of my group, however, because the restaurant itself is pretty small, the whole group needs to be present in order to get seated...so make sure to scold the friends that are always late to be on time! Lol The interior smelled amazing and the decor was simple, reminiscent of the restaurants I visited in Japan.   I ordered the vegetable curry, spice level 7, and added chicken katsu. As a big fan of spice, I'll vouch that you'll get the level you asked for! It has always annoyed me when you're expecting a certain spice level and it's either either too spicy or not spicy enough. If you want to stay on the cautious side and order low, you can always add some extra chili flakes they have on the table. The curry itself was delicious and very flavorful. The veggies were cooked tender enough to cut with just your spoon. Although the chicken katsu was small, it was yummy and all white meat! I also ordered the takoyaki and I was happily surprised. The outside was crispy and the inside still tender but not undercooked, with large pieces of octopus.   The waitress came by frequently to refill our waters and was nice enough to ask if we needed our checks split. I was very happy with my experience at this place and I will definitely be bringing my boyfriend here to check it out.",

I had the pork katsu with spicy 10 curry with spinach and corn additions.  The corn was like 20 kernels and the spinach was devoured in the curry so not much green to it.  It had a little kick but nothing crazy.  The pork was your basic breaded meat.  I enjoyed the meal but it definitely hits you later in the day and gives you the bloated feeling.    I paid $13.95 total for my meal so it's definitely not that cheap either.  I'd rather eat at many of the other options in China Town or the shopping plaza alone.  But if you're into katsu then it's a good rendition.",

Not only was the Japanese Curry stayed True too japanese style curry but just from the whole decor inside and moment you step in. Me growing up in Hawaii japanese curry is common place in the islands. The first things that brought me back was soon as you walk in they great you in japanese like anything other japanese restaurant. The counter style action and the size or lack of size (four tables in the entire restaurant) so timing is everything here Japanese Curry Zen. I went odd time so missed the lunch crowd. Small business feel the owner busting out all the curry action and really appreciate your business. The little spices that can add too curry on the tables or counter. Curry done right!  I ended up going with grew up with some chicken katsu curry with add on corn. The chicken katsu was perfect. It was nice golden crispy brown on the outside, moist cooked on the inside, and combine with japanese curry it was divine! Just wished they had some kim chee action on the menu. Still it was the perfect plate lunch action without the mac salad. Lol! They do have other choices for protein and other sides. Really menu not that big just simple, delicious, and all about the curry action. I know lot of options comes too curry but if want some authentic curry Japanese Curry Zen great spot. Small menu not much dessert just walk next door for some Snowflake action!",

It used to be a small hole in the wall, now it's a big hole in the wall! The layout was a bit awkward, but the whole restaurant looked nice and clean with a couple of television screens.  Now for the important part... the food. The food continues to improve each time that I come back here. The menu also keeps expanding. In this particular visit I ordered their kushi katsu 5 piece (chicken, quail egg, zucchini, shrimp, shiitake mushroom) curry plate. It was on the chalkboard where they listed their specials. It was good and I definitely will be making a return visit sooner rather the later most likely the next time I'm in the Las Vegas area.",

Most of all they have different levels of spice to no spice, mild, or really spicy all depending on your preferences.

    "text": "Just came back from lunch here. It was totemo oishii desu yo! I had the pork katsu and croquette. The waitress told me the portions weren't that big and I was really hungry so I got the croquette too, but now I am very full and happy.  I paid $15.08 with tax for the pork katsu, croquette ($2.00), and thai iced tea ($2.50). The food came out pretty quickly. The service was prompt and the owner came out and checked on us to make sure everything was good.   The pork katsu was crispy fried on the outside but still tender on the inside. The curry tasted as if it were home made and I suspect it is, unlike other places in town which openly state that they use a curry base that I could easily buy at the store and make myself (i.e. the curry place in the food court adjacent to Clark County community college). There was a lot of curry sauce which I like to sop up with my rice. You can get different levels of heat 1-10, everything about a 5 though there is a surcharge for. I asked for level 5 and it was a little hotter than I would have preferred but that's what i get for asking for a 5. I assumed that as Japanese food is generally not known for heat a level 5 would be about a level 2 in a thai food place but I was wrong. It was still really good and whew... my sinuses are cleared at the moment. I also liked that they give you condiments, I love condiments, they provided pickled radish which was not too heavy on the vinegar and had a really good flavor, onions that had a little beat of heat, almonds, and raisins. Also, tonkatsu sauce and extra hot chili powder. Taking another yelpers suggestion I tried the almonds which added a nice crunchiness and texture to the dish.   That is what I like to see a restaurant that has a relatively simple menu but does it well. If anyone has seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then they would understand you do one thing and you do it well and you always strive to do better - and if you haven't seen it definitely a must see.   The dining room was small but modern and clean. Upbeat vibe. I would recommend for anyone who is up for some curry. In fact with so many great places to choose in the shopping center where Japanese Curry Zen is located there is no way to go wrong!",

    "text": "Beware of their Spicy Scale... it's not rated for whiteys.   I was craving some Japanese Curry and thought I've give this place a try. The joint is super small, but it's as authentic Japanese Curry house as you can get. The place does get busy, so plan your meals accordingly. I went with their Chicken Katsu curry and added vegetables ($2.00) and corn ($0.50). Not that I like vegetables, but it'd give my curry an appetizing color and consistency. The super nice Japanese server asked me how spicy I wanted it and I went for the hottest, free, spicy level (anything above level 5 spicy costs extra.) Unlike other Japanese curry houses I've been to, their spicy, is effin' spicy. I could barely eat 2 bites without downing a glass of water. I ended up eating 1/3 of my curry, since I drank 3 gallons of water. My whitey counterpart co-workers struggled with level 2 spicy. Overall the food was fantastic, service was great, and the timing couldn't have been any quicker. I would definitely come back here for my Japanese curry fix.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

I got the chicken katsu curry which tasted great, but their curry tastes almost exactly like the popular 'golden curry' everyone makes at home so nothing special. My girlfriend got the katsu-don, a rice bowl with katsu and egg. It was good, and again if this was in my hometown it would be 5/5, but you can get a way more impressive katus-don down the street for the same price. One nice thing about this place is they sell a 22 oz beer for $5. Just not sure it's worth dealing with the parking lot and waiting in line to eat here",

I enjoy spicy food (much to my stomach's dismay) and this lived up to the spicy level. It left a warm feeling for a good hour after consumption. My boyfriend enjoys extremely spicy food so he got level 10. I tried a bite of it and it surprisingly still have good flavor not just heat.  I wish this was closer to my house and/or work so I could eat it more often!",

    "text": "While their curry may lead you to enlightenment the proteins at Japanese Curry Zen aren't worthy of your focused attention.  JCZ has some of the tastiest Japanese curry around!!!...but their proteins are regularly dry and overcooked.    They are doing a lot of things right here.  I'm a big fan of the deep, developed flavors of their curry.  They have brown and multi-grain rice options.  I can easily get down with the fried quail eggs in the Kushi Curry.  If you're into a little heat JCZ offers 10 blaZEN levels.  I highly recommend turning up the heat to about 80% of what you can handle...the heat adds a delightful dimension!  In fact, they are so good in these areas that it's a little frustrating every time you take a bite of sub-par Pork Katsu or Chicken Tenders.  The Vegetable Curry has some potential as well.  It is a mixed veggie combo of potatoes, broccoli, potatoes, carrots, potatoes, squash, and a little more potatoes.    I haven't written JCZ off completely....they're the old friend that doesn't' show a lot of gratitude but still wants to come over to eat every time you have people over.  And truth-be-told, I will probably be back sooner rather than later in search of their perfect dish for me.  I want to check out the Curry Pan, but they make a limited amount of these and you need to come early to secure one.  Another bright spot is JCZ's menu--created to easily explore and add-on different items.  These options make it effortless to sample several items and leave with a belly expanded greater than otherwise anticipated.",

It's ~6.95 with just curry and rice. ~9.95 for beef curry with rice and you can add a chicken katsu for an additional $3.  the takoyaki is ~$4.95 and still one of my favorite things to eat.

Appreciated how the curry sauce was packed separately from the rice and protein. Ample portions of all- had leftover rice and a large remaining puddle of sauce. Good value- per person total is around $11 without add-ons.  Side note about the spice: should have been a warning to see that spice levels 1-5 is \"free\". I thought a 3 would be safe, but the spice nearly made me sick towards the end. Good warm burn, but perhaps scale back to a two if you don't love spicy food. Solid place to get Japanese curry, love the straightforward menu.",

    "text": "Finally made visit #2 after months and months. Regretted waiting so long.  When I popped into Japanese Curry Zen tonight, I almost didn't recognize where I was. They've definitely expanded their dining room at some point in the last several months. This is a great thing for what I'm sure is still a popular dining destination.  For a change of pace, I decided to order the kurobuta sausage curry ($8.45). Kurobuta is synonymous with Berkshire, which apparently is a tasty and pricey type of pork. Google it or something. The sausage is really tasty and tender, somewhat sweet, and definitely on the small side (that's what she said). However, the flavor is more than enough to enjoy rice, curry, and kurobuta evenly for the whole meal.  Other than the choice of meat, the curry is the same for everyone. Good white rice (whoops, forgot that I had good brown rice last time) plus a savory, high temperature curry with their special blend of spices. I tried both the sweet pickled radish and the onion thingamabobs that they bring out to accompany the curry, and I went mostly with the sweet stuff to augment the flavor profile.  A note on the spice level: think a hot Thai place, or possibly worse. I went with a \"3\" again and ate fairly slowly, recalling how I rushed it last time and was punished for not waiting for it to cool. My advice: order conservatively and be aware that there are additional spice condiments available if you need them.  This is a must-try restaurant for anybody who eats any sort of food, and it makes the plaza that it inhabits even more special.",

    "text": "Whenever I go out to eat, I make sure that the food that I chose to get is something unique and something that I could not be able to make at home myself. Upon arriving I came in with a group of seven, we were placed right in the middle of the restaurant. We waited for about ten to fifteen minutes before ordering and I ordered the Chicken Katsu with an addition of sausage. I did not get any spicy level because it being my first time I wanted to taste the curry itself. We waited for another fifteen minutes until our food came and we still didn't have our napkins/ eating utensils. So when we asked for that and the pickled ginger we didn't touch our food probably until eight minutes after it came out. Service was a bit slow in the beginning but our server was very nice.   The food is a 3/5. Like I have mentioned before, I go out to eat especially to new places to determine if their food is worthy of being unique, meaning I wouldn't be able to replicate back at home. However, this curry was something that I knew I or my family could make at home. Of course it was good but there wasn't anything that stood out to me. Their chicken katsu was the same as well as their sausages. I paid about $3 extra for three pieces of sausages. Towards the end I didn't finish eating my curry because the rice/ curry ratio was completely off. There were more curry and meat itself than rice so that was frustrating. I pushed the curry to the side to see where the rice line ended and it didn't cover at least half the plate, it was about 1/4 of it. The food was overall okay, I just wished my rice ratio and sausage portion was bigger and the curry stood out opposed to thinking about \"I could make this at home\" type of thought. Calculating my bill without tip it came out to about $16. The plate is big but with the actually quality in the curry plates it does not break even to the amount you pay vs. what you get. Waiting for our checks and paying alone took longer than us eating, which we were confused about. We seen other people go got their checks after a leave the store before us.",

You can add as much toppings on your curry dish for additional charges. I got the original curry with sausage and vegetables. Spice level I chose was 0 although I believe I could have done level 2-3. My friend got the level 5 spice and she said it wasn't that spicy. The sausage on the dish was like mini wieners hot dog. The vegetables were carrots, broccoli, mushroom, potatoes. The curry had a little kick of spice in it but it was fine to me. I didn't care much for the sausage. The vegetables curry was good. Next time I will try the chicken Katsu with corn and cheese for toppings. The people next to us ordered it with a beer they obviously knew what to eat here. We also ordered the chicken skewers for appetizer. It looked like fried tofu but it was chicken. The chicken was tender and I liked the soy sauce served with it. I would come back here to try other dishes but overall I thought it was an okay place to eat. I'm not a big fan of curry in general.",

    "text": "I discovered this place because it's adjacent to Monta Ramen and Kung Fu Tea (which are both great places btw).  Plus Curry Zen is one of my bro's favorite Japanese Curry places to go.    It always feels like the parking lot is packed, but that's just all of Chinatown.  You'll always find parking here.   There's plenty of seating, and you have plenty of choices for toppings in curry.  I decided to get curry with spinach, cheese, and katsu.  I wish I shared because my plate was HUGE.....for me at least.  I ended up taking it to go.  I think what made if filling was the spinach.    I've gone to one other curry place, and I have to say the portions here are very generous.  Next time, I'll have to share.",

I haven't tried many curry places, but this has got to be the best curry place I've tried to date.  Located in China Town in the same plaza as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea, and Snowflake Shavery. There's plenty of parking. The restaurant has a very homey and traditional Japanese feel to it. We came around lunch time on a Saturday with a group of 10 people and they seated us immediately. Our server was friendly and quick on her feet. The prices for the curry is reasonable and it's a huge portion so it's worth it.  My friend and I decided to go with original chicken katsu curry with a croquette on the side. We got The curry was absolutely delicious; it was thick, flavorful, and you can really taste the spices. The chicken katsu was light and fried to perfection. It was my first time trying a croquette and I enjoyed it a lot. It's a deep fried mashed potato? It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be but it was light as well.   This is such a cute, quaint restaurant with amazing prices but better than that, equally amazing food.",

I also had a good craving of places like Coco ichibanya which I can't get anymore at home unless I drive a good while so Japanese Curry Zen really hit the spot in every way.  Although the service wasn't exactly the smartest cause we were trying to share some appetizers but waiter dropped it off w/ no plates and one utensil. -_-   With that said, I thought the  curry was great. I got level 5 and I thought it was great. It was spicier than I thought it would be but I also tried a lvl 9 and it tasted the same for odd reason so I say just get the lvl 5...save the extra cents. The pork katsu was really good. I usually get scared when they put a lot of fat into my pork(where they basically rip you off cause it's so much fat) but that didn't happen. Croquette was okay too. Really, the spotlight was the curry + pork katsu cause it really tasted great.  The one thing I did mind was the amount of rice curry ratio. So little rice(the curry amount was fine) but I didn't want my rice to be all drenched up because of how little rice they give me.   I do recommend it if you're a local.",

But Japanese curry holds a dear place in my heart.  Short: this place is as good or better than what I had in Okinawa.  We had the Curry Udon, Beef Curry, takoyaki (octopus balls), and the mixed fry.  Both curries at heat level 10 and both were exquisite.  The takoyaki reminded me of the street vendors in Urasoe and outside Gate 1 at Kadena.  Now, all I need is a place that serves Okinawan Soba and I'll be culinarily set for life.",

I stole some of the fried tofu because it was just really, really good and highly recommended. The spicy level does go a little too strong. I love spicy food, and I got a level three and i thought was a good balance already. My date had a spicy level seven and he was sweating bullets, but he loved it a lot. He grabbed an ice cold Sapporo and it just tied everything really well. I also highly recommend the takoyaki, a good appetizer to the plate. The place is pretty small, but it was great that we didnt wait long a table at all. The place was packed but we were seated in under 5 minutes. Definitely worth a trip back.",

    "text": "Decided to go here for lunch because it has been a while since I've had Japanese curry and I was really craving for some!   I ordered the chicken katsu curry and the curry pan. The chicken katsu was crispy and they used the white meat portion which was pretty good. I didn't have to worry about the meat being too dry since I had the curry for moisture. The curry itself was just okay. There wasn't much of a strong flavor to it compared to places like Curry House and Coco Ichibanya. It was pretty hard to taste the spices in there, but at least it didn't look watery lol. The curry pan has a nice crispy shell and the inside was a thick curry paste which more flavor than the curry from my other dish. The only critique was that it was given to me lukewarm and not warm and toasty which makes me think if they just reheated it or used a microwave or something. I didn't request for them to reheat it because it was still edible and I generally don't like to cause problems for the staff unless it was something major.   Either way if you are in the area feel free to check this place out. It isn't the greatest, especially if you've been to other curry dishes from other restaurants, but it does fulfill the curry cravings. Be sure to ask for the red pickles because they sometimes forget to give it to you along with your dishes. They also give you onions here which is pretty neat. They aren't strongly flavored so you don't have to worry about it overpowering your dish. Parking in this small plaza can be a hassle during lunch or dinner so take that into consideration!",

You can actually spin the plate around. I feel like the curry would of tasted twice as good if it was served in a ceramic plate. Also, as a Japanese person, I felt that the fukujinzuke (pickles) should have come with the curry, but I needed to ask for it. Japanese curry isn't curry without it. I was disappointed in that. Plus they charge 50 cents for extra fukujinzuke, which I thought was ridiculous. Should be complimentary.",

However, they need to fix their spiciness scale. On  a 1-10, I ordered a lvl.2 spicy thinking it would add just a bit of extra flavor, and boy was I wrong. It was borderline inedible. It tasted more like a 5 or 6. My friend ordered lvl.1 and even hers was pretty spicy.   So, the food is delicious, but be warned,  if you are sensitive to spicy food, even if you like a little bit of spicy, stay on the safe side and order lvl.0. That's what I plan to do next time.",

Which means, they are from Japan and some of y'all think all Asian are from Japan or China.   Came here after a horrible massage next door. I ordered Katsu-Don and Katsu-Curry. I must admit, Katsu-Don has always been a favorite of mine since at a young age in Japan. It tasted just like how I remember it. Not too sweet and just perfect. The Curry, it was a bit too salty for me. But it was good.   The Katsu was fried to perfection. Wasn't greasy or soggy. In fact it was crunchy even after the Curry was on top and Katsu Don Sauce was over it.   I will be back next time I'm in the area. A go to spot for authentic Japanese good outside of Americanized Sushi spots.   #SOLitFood",

Their menu isn't too extensive, but it offers different meats and sides for the curry. My friend had the chicken katsu curry with spinach, while I had the chicken Katsura curry with mixed veggies. The curry is thick and rich and very flavorful, while the chicken is cooked perfectly. The chicken is moist and tender, while keeping a crispy outer surface. I definitely recommend getting the curry with veggies or spinach because this adds an extra texture and flavor to the curry.",

I no longer live in Vegas but whenever I come home, I make sure to stop by here to eat and get a few orders to go to take back to AZ with me.   I usually get the Chicken Katsu Curry (no spice) + gyoza. The serving size is generous and the prices are very reasonable. The chicken is always cooked to perfection, and the curry sauce has always been on point. Call me crazy, but I never get tired of the curry here, ever.  Zen is located in a tiny, super busy area of Chinatown with lots of traffic because of next door businesses. The dining area is a bit small, but the wait is usually bearable and the food makes it worth it. Because it's a busy area, parking can get craaazy, so just a heads up. Overall, if you like Japanese curry or would like to try, this is a good place to start.",

The service here is really efficient. Both of us ordered the chicken katsu with level 3 spicy.  The chicken katsu is made really well. When you cut or bite into it, the breading doesn't just fall apart. That separates great katsu from badly breaded chicken. The curry was good, came out piping hot and had a slow creeping heat to it. I'm glad we asked what \"medium\" was and he said 2-3 on the spice level (out of 10!). I can handle my own with spice but I don't even want to imagine how spicy 10 is. I would recommend 3 for some heat without being too hot.  Overall, I would definitely come again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

They cook their curry in a vegetable broth so it is definitely vegetarian friendly here. I wouldn't say vegan because they might fry their Katsu chicken in the same oil as the tofu style katsu.   You can customize your level of spice here. I normally just get level 3 for my curry because it has a perfect mild kick. The Chicken Katsu is delicious but my favorite is the tofu style. Great flavor!! Amazing crunch!! You can add veggies, cheese and all these other toppings on your dish. They also serve 16 grain rice there which if you are a brown rice lover, its such a great option to have! Very healthy and delicious.   The servers are soooooo nice here! They quick and come around often to refill your drinks and to check on you. They train them well! I recommend this place if you love Japanese curry. You'll be really happy!! Cheers!",

However, I sadly have to say that this place has been lacking consistency. I've played around with the different spicy levels by trying everything from 1-5, but now I always order a spicy level 3 and it always differs. Some days the spice is tolerable and tastes more like a 2. Other days, the spice is almost overbearing and tastes it like it should be a level 5. They also lack consistency with their proportions.  On the contrary, their curry is absolutely savory, sweet and spicy (depending on your spice level). It is made up of a soupy broth and over 10 different spices, which gives it such a distinctive flavor. My favorite dish to order is a Tofu Katsu Curry with a spicy level of 3. Some of my favorite toppings are corn, cheese, and kurobuta sausage. I recommend eating any of the curry dishes with the red radishes and the white scallions. Also, for appetizers, I recommend their takoyaki. It is probably one of the best takoyaki dishes I've had in Las Vegas thus far.",

If you have large party, it is better to call and RSVP rather than just drop off. Parking might be a challenge since it is in the same plaza with Monta and they get busy during lunch hour. Some people park on the side road when it's full.   Decor: Nothing special in their decor. They kept it clean which is important.   Menu: Obvioualy, curry is their specialty. Please note this is a Japanese curry which has a different ingredients and taste from Indian curry. They have ingredients list what goes to their curry. All of them sounds healthy. The spicy level can be adjusted from 1-10. I ordered spinach curry with a side of 5 pcs Kushi (variety of deep fried tempura items: chicken breast, quail eggs, vegetables, mushroom and shrimp). For me spicy level 5 is perfect!  They have beer and wine as well. Of course, I had to go with Calpico since it's my lunch hour.   Service is quick and efficient. They usually have two server around and they provide an excellent service.   Overall, this is a perfect lunch place to go. It is quick, price is reasonable. Food is prepared carefully and taste good.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and there was a lot more on the menu that I wanted to try, but as a solo Diner I didn't have the stamina or strength to try everything... So I will definitely be back.  I just had the basic chicken katsu curry and it was amazing, satisfying, everything you would need on a rainy day craving some oh so good Japanese comfort food!",

Next tried out the curry udon noodles. It was a bit salty but not too bad. The pork was a little dry but the curry fish broth made up for it. I'd probably still order it minus the meat. Great price on beer. 22oz Kirin for $22. Definitely will be a regular here.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm in the mood for some curry, the first thing that pops into my mind is Curry Zen. Located on Spring Mountain and Decatur is a plaza filled with a bunch of popular food places. My review for this place has been long overdue as I have been coming here for years, back when the place was tiny and seated about 20 people. You can choose just plain curry and rice, or you can choose to add meat like chicken katsu, Pork katsu, chicken tenders, croquette, and much more. The portions are huge and the price is very inexpensive. However, once they expanded the place and made it bigger, Curry Zen wasn't like it was before. Previously each table had two different spices that you can sprinkle on as much as you'd like and there was ginger and pickled radish at each table. You can still get ginger and the pickled radish still, but you have to ask for it now. As for the spices, I am not sure if they carry those anymore as every time I went here I never saw anyone with those spices on their table. Food is just as good and I highly recommend the Takoyaki, Croquette, and chicken Karaage. As much as I would love to give this place 5 stars, each visit, especially with take-out there is something wrong with my order, whether it's overcharging me, missing an item, or giving me someone else's order, but I always check my take out orders before leaving so make sure if you get take out you double check your order! Service needs to be improved on as the original servers have either left or are not working when I go. The current servers never really check up on you and can be frustrating not getting your water refilled. Overall, the food here is still great, but not as good as before. I'd say this place is more of a 3.5 stars, but decided to give 4 stars because the food is still delicious and the portion sizes are big and the price is cheap. Overall, if the servers become more consistent and if the restaurant would bring back the spices and pickled radish and ginger to the tables this place would be a solid 5 stars",

Atmosphere is great, it's a small place but they flip tables really quick so typically you aren't waiting too too long. *TIP* their spice does not play, so be cautious when added heat to your curry. And for the little add one go crazy and test what you like. I found that adding cheese kinda makes your curry a little thicker but also very delicious. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to get more curry!!!",

    "text": "I went to Japanese Curry Zen a couple of weeks ago with my son and brother in law. Actually didn't intend to go there as we went out to try Monta Ramen. Line was too long at Monta and there was no wait at Zen.   I was very impressed. The curry dishes were spot on. But before I get there, because it was late and we were hungry, we ordered some appetizers. Ordered Gyozas and deep fried Siu Mai dumplings. I've never had a fried Siu Mai before. Both were good but not spectacular. They were on the smaller side (if you've been to a Chinese restaurant with good dim sum then you know good Siu Mai and Gyozas (potstickers) are pretty good sized where six to eight can make for a hearty portion). The skins were of course fried and crispy. The pork filling was good but not all that flavorful. The fact that we were hungry probably made them taste better than they were.   Now on to the entrees. I got the pork katsu cutlet and added curry with beef to my entree. The katsu was perfectly cooked. Tender, not too much salt, and crispy breading without a large presence of grease. The beef-based curry was rich, spicy (you can pick your spiciness poison) and flavorful. It had a medium thickness so that it was slightly runny but blended  well with the rice and cutlets. The beef cubes in the curry sauce were tender and flavorful as well. I threw on some of the pickled radishes that are semi sweet and salty and it was down home comfort food awesomeness. And I'm not even from Japan. I have always liked Japanese curry and it is hard finding places that do it outside of large coast cities like LA and the Bay Area (never looked for it on the east coast). This really hit the spot.   My son got the pork katsu donburi (rice bowl). It was excellent as well. Tender pork katsu cutlet covered with steamed egg and cooked and caramelized onions over rice with a light but flavorful teriyaki sauce. My son ate it all and I was happy to help him out with a few bites. I added some radish as a condiment.   My bro in law got the pork katsu with a side of sausage (never seen that before) with curry. Because this place lets you customize with add one, he added corn and shredded cheese (never seen that one either). I tried some and have to say although it was not something I would have ordered it was pretty darn good. The sausage was almost like a small smoked kielbasa with a crisp snap when you bite into it.   All in all, this place is worth a visit if you are in the Vegas Chinatown area and looking for something good and filling (not a light meal by any means).",

    "text": "Most of the time I am a tourist and eat on the strip when I come to the Ninth Island (Vegas).  However, on this trip I had my car and I wanted to eat where the locals eat.  Japanese Curry Zen is on Spring Mountain Rd, in the Seoul Plaza strip mall West of the 15.  They specialize in authentic Japanese curry here, that is hand stirred and silky smooth.  Curry and rice is $5.95 and you can add chicken or pork cutlet ($3.50), kushi (chicken; quail eggs (3); & zucchni - $3.50), and a variety of other toppings for an additonal charge.  We ordered the tempura oyster app ($3.60 for 3), tonkatsu ($9.45), and the foregoing w/ kushi ($12.95 - not pictured).  A can of soda was $1.  The oysters were excellent.  The tempura was cooked very well, and the oysters were fresh.  I have had overcooked, not so fresh oysters and they disintegrate when you bite into them.  These were nothing like the foregoing:  5 Stars.  Likewise, the curry was excellent.  You could see and hear the chef constantly stirring the curry sauce to perfection.  Secondarily, the color was perfect.  In addition, the pork cutlet was cooked properly.  It was not dry like other places I have experienced.  Lastly, the portion was a bargain for the price.  BTW, I ordered 3 out of 10 for spiciness, and I was SMAO:  5 Stars.  The service from our waitress was also excellent.  She was super nice, described how the menu worked, and really attentive:  5 Stars.  The ambiance is very basic, but it works for this small place.  Although the place is small, there were separate, clean restrooms:  4 Stars.  If you have a car, forget the overpriced, Americanized Azn food on the strip, and head to Spring Mountain Rd (I would compare to Garden Grove Blvd in OC).  In addition to Japanese, there is Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean.  The food is way better, and less expensive especially at this gem, Japanese Curry Zen.",

They've got an easy to read menu, easy to customize your food and all the food is so tasty that you couldn't go wrong with trying something new. As for me, I started out with Beef curry, went to Curry Udon, and now I've ended on Tofu Katsu curry. And every single thing I've ordered in between was DELISH.  If you grew up with this kind of food, rice and a side, you're gonna love this food. If you haven't tried something like this before, it's a welcome change and I promise you'd love it.   Cute atmosphere, extremely friendly and welcoming staff, and above all top notch food! Stop by Curry Zen and you'll keep coming back.",

He didn't give any suggestions or ask if we have been zen before. The appetizers came out fast and were the best dishes of the entire meal. The shumai was nice and hot. The tokoyaki was very delicious and hot. The curry on the other hand very bad. The rice was cold and it seemed like they just warmed the curry up in the microwave because I think we were the last customers of the night. Also curry was way too sweet for my taste.",

It could just be that my tastebuds are weird but it seems that the rice is slightly sweet which provides a perfect contrast to the spice-heavy beauty that is curry. The cool, soothing rice alongside the lively and warm ocean of flavor creates a dish of emotion. One can feel the love put into these edible works of art. I ordered a vegetable curry and rice with an addition of fried tofu. A surprisingly short time later, the friendly servers brought it. Holy seacow. Instead of only a couple small pieces of fried tofu, they placed four huge ones right on the dish! Whoo-hoo! The mushrooms in the veggies deepened the curry's flavor even more. Mmmmmm! The rice provided a sense of serenity. The curry was so incredible that I'm definitely coming back again.",

    "text": "Chicken katsu + curry + with potato croquette = Omgsoyum!   This place definitely delighted my taste buds! Their curry was traditional, very rich and thick, with a hint of sweetness. Compared to the popular chain, Curry House in California, I would say it's a neck to neck competition. Although, my biggest gripe at Zen was that they were light handed when plating the curry - they could of gave us more. We ended up buying an extra side of curry sauce for $1.50. However, the chicken katsu and the pork tonkatsu were both breaded very lightly and expertly fried to a crispy golden brown. They were extremely addicting.  We also tried their new menu item, Takoyaki $4.50. It had 5 plump balls and dressed generously with mayo, takoyaki sauce, and bonito flakes. They came out piping hot and about 2 pieces of tender octopus inside of each ball. The dough was more on the soggy end and also a tad bit bland. Maybe they could of been cooked a little longer.   I would pass on the curry pan next time. Even though the bread was lightly crispy on the outside, I felt that the overall dough was very dense and lacked curry filling. It was mostly air once I took a bite. (Curry House in CA will continue to hold the crown in curry pan).   We added:  - Potato croquette - My favorite! It was lightly sweet and breaded perfectly.  - Corn - simple canned sweet corn. I still loved it with the curry meal! - Kushi Katsu (5 skewers of kushiage): lightly breaded and fried and quail egg, zucchini, shiitaki mushroom, chicken tender - Everything was fried perfectly and the chicken tender was very moist and juicy, but I would pass on ordering these next time. They were too boring for me.   They have many different toppings to add to your curry: kurobuta sausage, potato croquette, corn, kushi katsu (3 or 5 sticks), vegetable, spam, tofu, tofu katsu, spinach, cheese, chicken tender.  Also their spice levels are no joke!  - Spicy 1-5 is free. - Spicy 6-10 is 20 cents extra.  We tried spicy #6 which had nice heat. Trust me, they don't mess around. It's not at all unbearable since we're avid spice lovers, but we could of actually went up a couple more notches as well, and loved it! I'm sure spicy 10 would be crazy spicy!   My favorite part had to be their unique table condiments! I loved adjusting the texture, sweetness, and spiciness of my curry dish at my own discretion. All of these go perfect with curry! - Fukujnzuke - Japanese sweet pickled radish - Rakkyo - Japanese style pickled pearl onions.  - Sliced Almonds - adds great crunchy texture to curry - Raisins - adds a nice sweetness to the curry and rice  - Curry powder - adds another level and dimension of curry flavor  - Spicy chili powder - adds spiciness",

    "text": "So basically I ate about 2 1/2 pieces of 8 of the Crispy chicken curry with rice and it tasted like paper and chewy or gummy! So I kindly asked if I could order another type of meat instead because I always get pork (which is usually great) I just decided to try chicken since the pork was so good. But I was wrong in my opinion the chicken tastes really processed or fake. So they refuse to give me pork because I was unhappy with the chicken, unless I bought it again at that moment. I thought since I came here literally 4 days in a row they'd be like sure since I am a loyal customer basically. But they just went from a 5  to 2  automatically because the customer should always get what they want if they're paying for what they're eating. Anyways the pork is good the chicken just taste fake like paper or whatever. Sad I loved them until now with that bull ish.",

Fluffy, & cooked the way Moms cooks it lmfao.   Spice levels is not something to take kindly! Make sure you know what level you can stand before ordering! I prefer spice levels where I'm not dying from the heat but enough to enjoy the meal. The slight sweat makes you feel accomplished after eating.   My go to will always be the Spinach & Egg combo with a side of that fire flame MeatLoaf lol. Plus cheese and corn! Can't go wrong! You'll find yourself wanting to come back in no time!!!",

Make the 5 minute drive and get away from the nasty overpriced strip food and try this one out.  We were disappointed with multiple strip meals and decided to try something out here.  A couple minutes later we had narrowed our choice down to Japanese Curry Zen, pulled in the parking lot, and were quickly seated.  The menu is decent sized, full of chicken, pork, beef, sausage, shrimp, and all sorts of other curry.  I went with the pork katsu, my girlfriend did the chicken.  We had some fried gyoza to snack on before the meal as well.  The fried gyoza was great.  Crispy, tasty, and a good price.  The curry came out pretty quickly as well and we were in heaven.  Tasty curry, good meat, and great rice.  For under $10 this was way better than anything we had on the strip for $25+ a plate.    Service was good, drinks were always topped off and everything was prompt.  We were in and out in under 45 minutes, paid around $30 with tip, and were on our way.  I won't eat on the strip again.  Every meal we had there was disappointing and overpriced.  5 minutes off the strip we had excellent meals, with this being one of them.  Seriously do yourself a favor and come out here if you're visiting!",

The sauce is very tasty, spices were well balanced as well as the heat of the curry. I like the fact that you have an option to choose white rice from brown rice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to those who love curry. This place is very inexpensive. The only con to the place is that they had there thermostat set to 80 degrees and it was pretty warm in there....",

I ate at their new location today on S Rainbow Blvd. It was very empty but the food was just as good. I almost prefer it because it was new, the sitting area is more open, and the fact that it was quiet atleast for now.. since I do like my quiet. Lol.

    "text": "I did not know Japanese Curry existed. Here's what happened: about 150 years ago the British started bringing Indian spices into Japan, Japan liked his they tasted and local families started making their own recipes. So what happens at Zen is that you get a family recipe. It's a unique blend of healthy spices (listed on a small menu - together with their benefits).  Ok so here's how it works: what you see on the illustrated menu is exactly what you get.- with the added value of taste buds awesomeness. No frills, no fancy decoration. Rice is white, curry is brown. Flavor is insane.  I tried a handful of \"hotness\" options and have to say that the hottest is totally bearable. They use different varieties of chili to obtain heat throughout the scale and a nice amount of Habanero in their hottest sauces (hence the redder coloration). Perfect blend and amount. Never too much - always enough to feel it and love it.  Now - I'm not the type who goes out for dinner seeking an ambience, I don't care. I want my joints to be clean and mainly I want them to provide a fantastic food experience. Zen is pretty straight forward: don't pick this place if you're trying to impress a date with fancy stuff, maybe try Chinese at the Bellagio's Jasmine.   Lights are bright at Zen, bill is super reasonable, staff is awesome, chef is great and food tastes better than a wish.  Since mouthful #1 I would have kept going, going, going....  Loved it! X  .",

Croquettes are really good though. Be sure to order your plate with at least 2 extra toppings, plate looks boring without it. Price for what you get seems little on top.",

Every time we've come here we literally got our plates within 7-8 minutes of ordering.  Brought me back to when I lived in Kochi Japan when I was little, and the quality of the food was mind blowing.  If you are a vegetarian, this place is perfect for you. The Tofu Katsu is like eating chicken. The fried food is not greasy at all and taste amazing. The chefs clearly know what they are doing, I have not one complaint about anything.  This place has become a weekly thing for me now, and I live 30 minutes away.   I would seriously have to go through a grieving process if this place shut down.",

My favorite order: Chicken Katsu Curry, spicy level 3, with one order of quail egg kushi, and one extra scoop of rice.  The food is spot on and delicious! Not only is the food good, the customer service is awesome. The cooks, servers, etc are all very polite and sincere, and all of them being able to greet and farewell in the Japanese tongue adds just that bit more of authenticity. Only problem I can see anyone bumping into is the language barrier. Their English isn't horrible, but some of them do have strong accents.  5 out 5 because this place rocks, the people rock, the food rocks, the atmosphere rocks.",

If I have a plate of Zen's curry and rice in front of me, you would have better luck having a conversation with Stephen Hawkins without his computer.   Yeah, it's that kind of place for me because it's that good at Japanese Curry Zen.  The first time, I walked into Japanese Curry Zen was a few months ago, and they won me over on the first spoonful of their Tonkatsu curry and rice.    It was a orchestra of flavors, and the unique herbal blend created Beethoven 5th symphony on my taste buds; it was bold, smooth, and complex.   It wasn't too spicy, but Japanese curry Zen has a  number of condiments on every table to satisfied the more picky eaters.   I'm proud to say, I didn't need any extra raisins or extra spices, because the flavors stood on it's own.     One advice to the owners, Please make a sumo sized plate for those overeating Hawaiians :) because I could go off like the Yellow Gorenger from Himitsu Sentai Gorenger series in this place.   If you never seen that series, the renger headquarters was located below a Japanese Curry cafe like Zen, and that Renger would be pounding out 5 to 6 curry plates each episode.       Zen doesn't have a large dining area, but I don't need a lot of time to eat here because I will clean out a plate within five to ten minutes.  The owners and majority of the staff are very genuine Japanese, and have that entire business spic and span clean.    Ouch!  Sorry Monta on that comment.   Everyone raves about Monta, which is located a stone throwaway from Zen, but I believe Zen is leaps and bounds better of the two Japanese restaurant in this shopping complex.   Heck, this might be my favorite Japanese hole in the wall that I ever been too.....and Yes, I am Japanese.",

It's a nice quiet tiny restaurant that you imagine in Japan and the host / watier was really friendly and polite. The menu is pretty limited with specials written on the board.  The nice thing about this place is that they serve both white and brown rice and also can do half orders on rice for those who are cutting down on carbs.   What I had to eat was the Pork Tenderloin Cutlet with Curry and Brown Rice + an additional Chicken Cutlet and Croquette. All of it was pretty good and the cutlets weren't dry at all. That with the combination of curry and rice makes the best comfort food after a long day!",

So I know a thing or two about Japanese Curry, as this is one of their most popular dishes besides Sushi. This place is authentic as it gets! It's run by a small Japanese family and gets real Japanese customers. (A great sign of authenticity with ethnic food)  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small (reminds me of the small restaurants that are common in rural parts of Japan) The decor isn't fancy like other curry houses and not as nice. It's just a simple place to enjoy great food. The staff especially the guy who takes our order are especially nice all the time and makes sure to check up on all the customers often.  The condiments are on the house, and I always load on the the pickled baby onions and curry powders. The flavor of the curry itself is perfect. I usually order the pork cutlet (chicken cutlet is a healthier option, and tastes just as good) with white rice, corn, sausage, and steamed veggies. They give you a very generous portion for the price, and I always leave this place fully stuffed and satisfied.",

Every time, their sauce has been hearty, savory, with that bit of sweetness that makes Japanese curry different from the rest.   There's just one thing that gripes me about this place and it's most likely due to their recent wild success. When I used to come back in the day in their tiny little hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant, my chicken always came consistently. However these days, it seems as though my chicken comes somewhat dry. It's not largely noticeable, nor is it huge enough to complain loudly about, but coming from one of my favorite curry houses ever, it's something I wish would always stay the same.   My favorite curry house of all-time will always be CoCo ICHIBANYA, a popular curry house from Japan that landed its way to some parts in the states. I particularly like their sauce just a bit more and I love that they have naan bread to dip in the sauce.   I request that Curry Zen brings in the naan bread and I will come running every time.",

I love how you can customize your basic Japanese curry plate and fix it up to your specific liking.  1, Proteins (chicken/beef/shrimp/kurobata sausage/etc) or some awesome combination using everything. (That's what I would do if I came back - have a Japanese curry plate sampler!)  2. Spice level (1-10)  3. Free tableside condiments (red pickles, raisins, pickled onions, ginger, curry and spice powders) Customize to your liking.   I ordered the PORK KATSU CURRY LEVEL 5 ($9.5) and the flavor was on point. CRAVE WORTHY. Rich and complex with out being too soupy or sweet. Perfect spice level for me. (Kaba curry is more on the sweeter side). The katsu was flavorful and crisp. They just cooked it a minute longer which made it a little dry. Same with the chicken katsu, but still very good. Good sized portion too.

Not really good for groups larger than 4.  -Came on a Saturday for lunch right when they opened at 11:30am and we were the 3rd group there.  -Have your curry topped with cheese. So good.

I've been coming here since the beginning, when they only had a couple of items on their menu, and it was perfect. Since then, they have expanded their menu but for the better! There are now more options for vegetarians - fried tofu or veggie curry are usually what I order.  Tips:  -The spicy levels on their curry do run a bit hotter than most places so if you want a mild, a 2-3 is perfect. Anything past 4 is like death to my papillae.  - The parking is also insane! If you want a guaranteed spot, try parking on the side streets next to the center. Many people do it and so far it hasn't caused me any trouble.",

They also have a condiment tray  with raisins, pickled onions, and radish which adds great taste and texture.   The restaurant is really small with maybe 5 tables as well as a counter with stools therefore you may encounter a bit of a wait at times, but it is so worth the wait.

I suggest chicken katsu and then veggies added. Also, get their croquette as topping! It's a good element to balance the heat.  Something that might help people deciding on spicy level: I am okay with spicy, and realized that 5 was my hot spice level. 5 already got my face sweating, but it didn't bother me. I guess the highest I could go is a 6. My friend got an 8. I tried and thought even someone like me who loves spicy food, I no longer can stand the 8 as I love to enjoy the food more, than alloting that time for eating to just wiping my face and running nose. My friend who still finished his plate says 8 is tolerable for him (he ALWAYS ADDS chili, red peppers, and/or jalapenos in his Asian and Mexican dishes) but will next time just go with a 7 or 6, he says.",

Curry Zen provides a variety of options for curry lovers as well as amazing appetizers. Not only that but they offer a smaller sized portion that is perfect for me.  My favorite is the tofu katsu with a side of radish and onion. Every time I come, it is made fresh and amazing. The curry is perfectly flavored and the tofu is scrumptious.  Not only is the food amazing, the staff is very friendly. They are efficient and kind. I couldn't ask for nicer service. The establishment is always perfectly clean.  I come to Curry Zen at least once a week and recommended it to everyone. I have never seen anyone not like the food here.",

I got a small chicken katsu curry and added a croquet. In all honesty, the small was plenty enough. I do recommend adding some other stuff since a small is about 3.50, it's forsure worth it.   My friend added some cheese, which was also pretty good.  I thought it was kind of weird that you have to pay extra to make it spicier.  The place in general is pretty small, so definitely avoid the lunch rush hours. Another plus? It's right next to snowflake shavery so don't stuff yourself too much and grab dessert after.",

If you like spicy food, they've got you covered AND can probably get you outside the comfort zone if that's what you're looking for! A 2-3 on their spice chart is considered \"medium.\"  The staff is great, and you'll see familiar faces if you go with any regularity. The menu obviously focuses on curry but there are a few other great options and appetizers as well.  Japanese Curry Zen has become a pretty common default option when I go out to eat.

Upon arrival, I was greeted quickly from one of the servers. The menu had selection, and options to add-on. I was pleased to see they had brown rice as an option, because although I'm Asian, I'm not a white rice type of gal. Lol :-) Since it was my first time, I just went with a basic katsu curry plate, with 3 fried shrimp. Portion size is okay, they give you curry and rice, but the katsu is a little on the smaller side. Taste wise, curry was good, their katsu was so-so. Pricing was cheap! Me and my husband's bill was a little over $20 included drinks. I'm not sure if I'll be back, I thought it was alright.",

    "text": "I have a new favorite curry place and this is it!  The Curry House restaurants in Orange County and Torrance had been my previous favorites, but this place just kicks it up a notch. While getting a foot massage next door I looked on yelp to find something good for dinner, and the reviews convinced me to try it.   After going back and forth about what to try, I saw the food delivered to the table next to me and just had to ask for exactly the same thing. The gentleman said it was double chicken katsu curry with sausage and corn, and I'll be damned if it wasn't every bit as awesome as he said, but more on that later. To get started we had the edamame which was perfectly steamed and topped with the large sea salt crystals that were a great flavor addition without being too salty. We also had the gyoza which were good, but not particularly remarkable in any way. In hind sight I should not have ordered the appetizers because I would soon be stuffed beyond capacity and feeling like an overfilled water balloon!   When the meal came the chicken was super moist and tender, with super flakey and crispy breading that blew away my expectations. The rice was perfectly done and sticky like it should be, mixing nicely with the curry. The corn was served beside the rice in a little pile, just begging to be mixed in, and the sausage looked like hotdogs but certainly didn't taste that way- more like a Polska Kielbasa with great flavor. The guy next to me sliced everything up and mixed it together, so when in Rome...well you know. Anyway, to make a long review even longer, I will add that the curry had excellent flavor and really brought the whole thing together nicely.  It was so good I think the only thing that could have made it better was getting it for free- actually, I am in town on business so I guess that means it was free after-all!  Guess I should go buy a lottery ticket now, cause I feel like I hit the jackpot with Curry House Zen tonight!",

I like that they put out all of the condiments for their curries on the table. Their radish dish is usually decimated between the group. The raisins and almonds give the meal a textural change.   The portions are more than reasonable and often filling. The flavor is the main reason why I keep coming back. For someone who boldly states his dislike for any dish, I will continue to try it until someone proves me wrong. Maybe I just had bad versions in the past. That is not the case here. I had to wait and sit on this review for some time just to make sure that the experience was consistent.  What I find most appealing about this place is the level of service. The food comes out quickly. The presentation is neat. The staff is friendly. The chef is so humble and comes out to thank his diners at the end of the meal. It is a warm atmosphere. With the new addition, it can easily seat more. It is just another great establishment for a jammed pack powerhouse of a plaza.",

We can tell that curry zen put their own secret sauce so it doesnt taste generic.    So far we've tried the chicken katsu curry as well as the vegetable curry.  Both are very good and tastes like a kick ass home-made meal.  The chicken is all white meat which I love!  You can also adjust the spiciness according to your risk tolerance.  I love spicy foods and I find they tend to make it more spicy than not...so definitely be cautious with selecting spiciness.  Parking can be a headache sometimes but its well worth it.
