The place is so cute and they have the greek music in the bkground so you feel like you're on the set of that wedding movie.   I ordered the souvlaki mini. Perfect for me. mini greek salad, a skewer of chicken, skewer of steak, rice, pita bread, that yogurt sauce and lemon.  I'd order that again in a heartbeat.   My bf went w/ the super lemon chicken pita sandwhich and it was to die for. I loved it. even just the one bite, I'd drive all the way bk from Henderson /Green Valley just to order that.   After reading the reviews the only thing we knew for sure was we were going to order the greek fries. eh. that was the lowest rated item I tried. Nxt time I go I'll get the lemon pita and a baklava.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. And the ONLY reason they did not get 5 stars is because of the same small, simple thing that happens quite too often. I eat here AT LEAST twice a month of not more (sometimes once a wk)  and I pay EXTRA for extra sauce, and 85% of the time my EXTRA sauce that I PAID for is missing. It's already bad if an eatery forgets the sauce that comes with your meal, but for a sauce that is PAID for by yourself wether if it's 50 cents or $5, you, we, PAID for it. Please don't leave that out!!! I'm such a pushover and HATE complaining and esp over a $1 sauce. But hey, that's A DOLLAR (or whatever the amount is.) Other than that, the food is amazing and soooo good that I choose to come back. Plus I tried quite a few other Greek places and they are not nearly as good as here. I just wish they'd be a little more attentive to these \"small\" big things",

I have eaten at another Greek place on the other side of town and that was good, this place it's even a wee bit better.    Since I had eaten prior to our lunch date, I told my husband that I would just share with him.  We shared a Gyro plate and baklava.  This plate was full enough for the both of us.  Lots of lamb and beef.  It comes with pita, rice, and greens.  The beef skewers had four large cube pieces and it was not over cooked, it was cooked medium well, just the way I like it.  Service was fabulous and as a matter of fact it was one the workers b-day, I think it was Mary.  Anyhow, if on this dude of town, this place has some really good, healthy grinds!",

We also got to speak to the owner during this visit and he spent at least 15 minutes talking to us about how he got started in the business. Absolute pleasure to speak with!

The steak kabobs were excellent ! They are marinated in lemon and herbs. It is served with rice and a fresh salad. The rice has a lemony flavor to it.

I get the Veggie Kabob (Vegetarian here) but back in the day before I was a Vegetarian, I had the Steak Kabob - SO.  GOOD.  Also the Greek Fries are like heaven in your mouth.  I could eat them all day (and I do, and that's why I also have a gym membership.)  I also tend to order extra salad or rice when I go, because it's so good.  They have plenty of ample seating and a nice background noise of music, as well as a TV usually on during the day.    The staff is also really friendly.  I love to just go in there and chat with them while I wait for my food - they're caring and this is a great example of a family owned business that we need more of in Vegas.  (I know I've said it already: but TRY THE GREEK FRIES!)",

The pita is always soft and the rice is so perfectly cooked and flavorful.  I've brought many people here with me and every single person has always wanted to come back again and again.  I highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that if you want to split a meal (because the portions are huge) with someone they charge you and additional dollar for a styrofoam plate and fork.",

Authentically owned former food truck that prospered into this local icon due to it's amazing tastes and authenticity! You know when you're craving that one dish and nothing will take care of that craving unless you get \"that dish from that place?\" Well that's how I feel about my chicken lunch special here at Yassou. For under $10 bucks a lovely salad, rice. Pitas bread, humus and that lemon chicken skewer... see now I have to go myself,again. Best rice which is critical for this type of food but the succulent juicy lemon chicken, does not get more delicious. The owner and son will be there with a smile. Does get busy during that lunch time rush but has plenty of seating indoors and out. Feel free to call ahead with your order if you're short on time or looking for pick up. Service I wonderful and quick, but its not fast food, made to order so give yourself a few more mins.. just feel like I'm in Greece when I'm there so I enjoy to dine in. Wonderful large menu from Saganaki to the lighter side of salads.  Enjoy... and Yassou PLEASE FOLLOW ME AND ASK ME ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC SPOTS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN & WGAT IS THE OCCASION FOR THE DINING EXPERIENCE (first date, fun night out with friends, cheap and fun day out of towners)OR ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'LL WRITE A REVIEW FOR YOU ON ANY PLACE AND ANY TYPE! OVER 70 COUNTRIES I KNOW HOW ITS \"SUPPOSED\" TO TASTE!... Just ask the local ;)",

I would give it 1 star for the dolmades if not for the above. Why is there meat in it?? The grape leaves were hard, old, and stringy/veiny. The dip that came with it was lemony-sour but also oily in a way that its yellow tallowed appearance reminded me of lard. And the texture was similar.   I'll stick with Meraki Grill.",

    "text": "My family and I used to come to this restaurant regularly about 10 years ago. It always served excellent Greek food and today for Fathers Day we were in the mood for Greek and thought we'd revisit...only to be really disappointed.   The first thing we noticed was how dirty the floor in the dining area was and the bathroom's poor condition. One restroom was out of order and the other was disgusting, in the most literal sense. It smelled very strongly of urine (it was so intense it actually reminded me of cat urine ) and the floor was covered in dirty marks, paper towels and long hairs. I have no idea how so much hair has accumulated in a restaurant bathroom unless someone literally washed, blow dried and styled their hair in there. Additionally, the bathroom hardware was dirty, rusty and in pretty bad shape.  Next we ordered our food and were surprised not to see any actual Greek ppl behind the counter or on the line. We always felt like we had a genuinely Greek experience when we previously came as the person at the til and the cooks obviously had either a hand in ownership or had a personal connection to Greek culture and cuisine.   As for pricing, we were expecting it to be slightly overpriced, as good Greek food can be. If you aren't eating at Del Taco, you can't expect those prices. Unfortunately, Yassou's prices no longer represent the freshness or quality of the food. The food came out very sporadically and some entrees took an exceedingly long time. There were 9 of us eating and all of our meals came out at different times, which is awkward for a family meal with kids who get their food last. I had requested that my Greek Fries be extra crispy and when they were delivered mine didn't look any different than the other normal Greek fries we had ordered. When I asked the food server about my fries' appearance she said that mine were definitely the extra crispy ones and that they all are, in fact, prepared extra crispy. It was a weird comment and didn't really make sense since none of the fries were very crispy anyway, but it was obvious that she didn't have much of a say behind the counter and was trying her best to help the customers in the dining room. The hummus portion was generous but only comes with 1 pita cut into very small triangles, so unless you plan to eat your hummus by the spoonful, you'll have request more pita. Lastly, the meat on my gyro plate was shaved very thinly and the slices were dried and hard before I was even half done. The only thing redeeming about our experience was the excellent customer service of the food runner. She was very friendly and helpful. Offering a cup lid for my young daughter's water and bringing extra napkins, etc. She was great. Overall, we are very disappointed in the current condition of what used to be a fantastic Greek meal AND experience in this part of Las Vegas.",

We ordered 3 appetizers and a main entree and shared everything. $30 for 2 people for lunch is reasonable! Everything we had was delicious! I'm a fan of their pita bread and hummus! I found my new favorite greek spot for lunch in the city! I will come back! My gf and I both agreed YGGC rocks! Love it! If you're in the area or visiting the city and looking for greek food... come here! no regrets! great customer service, no problem with seating (indoor/outdoor) or parking, affordable! -Miss Yelp 2012",

    "text": "I don't often eat Greek food even though I really do like it.  Glad the stepdaughter introduced us to Yassou!  Good Greek food right off of Charleston near Summerlin.  Lots of folks visit, can tell you're in the affluent part of town because of all the cars parked outside!  Our lowly Acura was parked between a new BMW and a Mercedes coupe.  Dang did that make me feel poor.  Oh well, suck it rich people I can eat at Yassou too!  Upon entering the restaurant, it definitely reminds you of the diner from that movie \"My Fat Greek Wedding\".  White & blue dually represented!  Nice little family run place.  Wasn't particularly busy in the place that day, noticed that lots of folks were doing take-out, or picking up large catering trays for glitzy parties.    Menu is displayed prominently on huge boards right above the service counter.  Kinda hard to miss!  Menu was varied, went from traditional Greek fare to items of a more modern palette.  We of course, stuck with what the Greeks know.  And what they know is pretty darn tasty.  Throw the spanakopita, dolmades, and hummus aside...show me the meat!  Although I'm sure those items on the menu are probably pretty good, I was here for some carnivorous action.  The wifey and I went for the Souvlaki Combo - one beef and one chicken skewer marinated in the house lemon herbs & spices.  Our plates came with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce.  Overall the plate was good.  The skewers were a nice serving, and you could definitely taste the lemon and herbs throughout.  My beef skewer was juicy, but the chicken skewer was a little dry probably because it was breast meat (which tends to dry out).  The Greek salad was good with feta, tomato, cucumber, olives, and lots of red onion (which the wifey didn't really like), topped with their house vinaigrette.  Tasty.  Pita bread and the tzatziki sauce was good too, pita being warm and soft, with the tzatziki being a good complement for dipping things in to.  I wasn't a fan of the rice pilaf though, it didn't do much for me.  It's probably because I'm more of a sticky rice kinda guy.  Overall a decent plate.  What I really should have ordered was what our kids ordered.  I almost wanted to switch halfway though our meal!  They got the popular My Big Fat Gyro - gyro sandwich with flame broiled sliced beef & lamb, feta cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.  Along with a large order of Greek fries - fries with herbs & spices, and feta cheese.  This stuff was delish!  The thin sliced beef with the lamb, all combined into that gyro made a wonderful dish.  Was hard to put down after a few bites!  I will definitely have this instead the next time I visit Yassou.    Prices were kinda on the high side for me (I'm a cheapie eater) but I guess if you want quality food you gotta pay for it.  Our plates were about $9 each, and the gyros were a tad over $7.  Fries were separate, and cost us another $3 or so.  Servings were generous though.  On the plus side, they serve Coca-Cola!  Figure it would have been Pepsi since of the blue motif and all.  The restaurant has two different seating sections, one is in the restaurant, but there is another area on the outside in more of a patio setting.  Nice if the weather is good outside, or if you have a large party of folks with you.  I'll be back.  OPA!",

However the salad I had was good. I also ordered a soup that took like ten min to come out but I asked and they apologized and gave me a free baklava.

It's worth the drive from Boulder City (where I live) if that tell you anything!  Produce on salads and gyros is fresh, as is the meat - always well seasoned and cooked well. I've tried several things here, Spanakopita is fresh, truly made by hand (no pre boxed frozen stuff here). Fries are perfectly cooked and it's worth the upgrade to Greek fries. Feta cheese on salads and fries is creamy and tangy. Pitas are soft and delicious, and the gyros are made with generous portions. Sauces are delicious! The Baklava is made daily, SUPER fresh, warm, and the perfect balance of sweetness with the richness of the pastry and nuts. One word of warning, they do not serve pitted olives so watch your teeth!   The staff are attentive and fast. This is a True family owned business and I see the owner and his son working their butts off every time I'm in. The eating areas are kept clean, and there's lots of natural light coming in and a nice outdoor patio area if you like. For what you get, the price is very reasonable.",

So finally, I decided to try it. Because it was new to me, I decided to keep it simple. I ordered the Spanakopita. Lord have mercy, it was a flavor overload that my taste buds had been dying for!!! Imagine, such a simple dish with amaze ball flavor!   Since then, my husband has become addicted to the \"big fats\"; and I've tried the dolmades, and pastitsio. He's also tried the lemon herb chicken pita. We both have yet to be disappointed. In all honesty, we eat here weekly. So much so that when I call in my pickup order, they know it's me...and they make sure I get my 'spana'. Keep up the good work guys! We love and appreciate everything about Yassou!",

Whatever we get...gyro's, souvlaki combo's, hummus, salads, etc...we always get a Mediterranean pizza with lemon chicken as well to take home for later - it is excellent. Everything is made to order so it will take a little while if you arrive at peak times.",

From souvlaki with juicy chunks of either beef or chicken interspersed with onions and green peppers, now there's grainy chunks of lower-quality beef and overcooked, dry chicken, one or two slivers of onion and no green pepper to speak of.  All we ever get is the souvlaki plate, but lately we're considering finding another place to order out.  Sad, because for years we got consistently delicious food.",

Also ordered a side of the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Unlike most places that serve the oily canned meatless variety, these are homemade with ground beef.  It was odd though - in some, the meat was juicy and in others it was dry and crumbly.  Obviously I preferred the juicy ones, but they were hit and miss.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Great place.",

If it is your first time go with the my big fat greek gyro and make it a combo with Greek fries.  It's the best gyros in Vegas hands down.  Other items on menu are good but take a little bit longer to cook.  They just upgraded by getting another gyros cone cooker to help with the increase of customers.  The word has gotten out this place is a hidden gem in Vegas.  If you are staying on the strip its worth grabbing it and taking it back to your room or suite like my friends did.   Enjoy!",

I ended up parking in the McDonalds parking lot and walking next door. The decor is very nice with a few tables outside for outdoor dining during the warmer months.  Greek Fries Standard fries with feta cheese and some chopped parsley. Given the price difference between Greek fries and American fries being 50cents more i would have gotten the standard fries. There just wasnt enough feta or herbs to enhance the fries and make them tastes different or Greek for that matter.  Chicken Souvalaki Overall excellent, the side salad was fresh and crispy, could have done with a few more olives. The Pita bread is EXCELLENT soft and chewy very nice texture. Excellent rice pilaf, buttery with a fresh lemonly taste. Chicken was cooked to perfection, nicely flavored and still juicy in the middle.  I would highly recommend this place to others and will definately come back to try out other dishes.",

My most recent visit there was a new employee I believe his name was Demario and he just made the whole experience joyful!  Good job guys! And Vegas go check out Yassous!!!",

I had the \"Big Fat Gyro\", salad, pilaf and spanakopita... maybe auto correct got that one for me.  I missed out on the baklava... but I think it may not have ended up on my order.  I was too excited to check and to be honest everything else was so so soooooo good, I didn't have room for it.  Next time though I am gonna get it.  The filo dough on the spanakopita was so light and airy, not heavy like some places that use too much oil/butter between layers.  The filling was perfectly seasoned.  The meat in the gyro was too.  And the edges were slightly crisped, just the way I like it.  The tzatziki was different from what I have had in the past more herbaceous than what you get at chain places... the garlic and cucumber were balanced so wonderfully it wasn't cucumber yogurt with some garlic.  The price was good too.  And the serving size?  Perfect!  *especially for the price.*  Anyway, if I was able to, I'd eat here multiple times a week.  But I have bills to pay and all that jazz so when I can get here again it's a treat.",

I glanced over the menu and picked from one of the two vegetarian options. I picked what I thought would have been the healthier of the two, Veggie Spreads Plate.   The Plate consisted of rice pilaf, greek salad, pita bread, two small stuffed grape leaves (I think it was grape leaves), and containers of spread.   Rice pilaf and pita bread dominated the plate, making it a hefty serving of carbs. In my opinion the rice pilaf was bland, lacking flavor. The greek salad was a ordinary salad, though the dressing was also bland. Keeping it consistent, the hummus was bland as well.   Like I mentioned in the beginning, I was left feeling \"meh\". I have definitely had better. Perhaps the positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers are as the result of meat plates?   As a vegetarian, this place definitely did not do it for me.",

The decor was tasteful and the owners Greek Pride definitely shows through! My gyro arrived promptly and it was immense.  What a huge sandwich for such a reasonable price!  Pita bread was soft and warm and the meat and other fillings burst forth in a cornucopia of flavor! I highly suggest a stop here for the food and atmosphere.  I will be back!",

My wife often makes fun of me when we go to Greek restaurants because I complain that they don't serve enough meat on their gyros or gyro plates. Not this place! It'd be fair to say that they even serve to much. I ended up forcing myself to eat all of the meat and left the trimmings because I didn't want to waste any of it. It's so good, that no matter how full I was, I still wanted to eat more.   I had the traditional beef and lamb gyro, and my wife and I split the gyro pasta. The kids had the beef skewers. Awesome!",

I like that it's casual and quick but you can opt to sit, take your time, and enjoy yourself if you'd like.   I called my order in for pick up and it was ready it about 10 minutes. For $26 I got the Big Fat Gyro with a side of salad/rice, the Gyro/Chicken Souvlaki combo, a side of Spanakopita, and a drink.   It was delicious and filling with enough to eat for lunch the next day. The chicken skewers is a definite recommendation as the chicken breast is so juicy, flavorful, and tender. The spanakopita side came with 2 large pieces which was very delicious.   They have a cafe to the side which I plan on trying sometime soon. I'll definitely be coming here often.",

I love their Italian dressing and tzatziki sauce also. The owner is here pretty much everyday, very friendly gentleman and remembers his repeat customers!

I have only eaten the chicken and steak souvlaki. The chicken and meat is probably the most flavorful, juicy, and tender I've had from comparable restaurants.  The Greek salad is awesome! The rice is to die for! The pita bread is so good too. This is a great family owned and run restaurant and the prices are awesome considering the amount of food and quality you get. Most plates are $8- $9. Peak lunch times you will sometimes see a line out the door.   Give this place try, you won't be disappointed. 8D",

Found this place on Yelp and bookmarked it, then heard from my BF that it was an old favorite place of his, so naturally we went by our first full day in town.  The lunch specials are well-priced and delicious- for $10/each we got a gyro (the big fat for him, the lemon chicken special for me), with greek fries and a drink. Not bad at all, and portions are huge. Price for value is excellent.  Both gyros were delish, but i'm more a fan of the traditional gyro meat rather than the chicken, though it was good to see a healthier option on the menu. Worth a try, at the very least. Greek fries are the bomb- regular fries with feta, and maybe some garlic?, and parsley. Delicious. And for a take out order, they are carefully wrapped so as not to displace any of the plentiful crumbly cheese. Smart thinking!  Love how the owner himself is working alongside the employees to make and fill the orders- great sign and also underscores the quality you can expect here.",

I've had my fair share of gyros in this town.  Gyro: Not as heaping with meat as my favorite gyro place in Henderson. The meat was more cooked and saltier than what I'm used to. I couldn't finish it. More tzatziki to mask the saltiness please. 3.5/5  Greek Fries: I love fries. Crispy, crunchy and hot with a little bit of feta cheese and parsley. Not the best Greek fries I've had but still good. They only give you a handful so you might want to order another side of fries. 4/5  Strawberry Banana Smoothie: This is absolutely great since I don't drink soda. They have strawberry, mango, banana, etc. I asked them to make strawberry banana smoothie for me if it wasn't too much of a hassle and they did. Yay!  5/5  But for what you get with the combo, it's definitely good value. I'd much rather drive 3 more miles to get here than eat at G Time. Plus, the service was great.",

    "text": "TOP GREEK CAFE SO FAR!   **2016 YELP 100 LV CHALLENGE #1**   SO I thought I had tasted the best Greek cafe mom & pop shop, but w/ the new year I have found another GEM in Las Vegas!! Although it is a bit far I am willing to drive the distance! We even saw the owner working his but off in the kitchen which you know that the food is being prepared at it's best!!   The staff are SUPER HAPPY all the time it seems & enjoy what they do. You can definitely see it in the food. You order your food at the redigister & pay then they bring out the food to your table.  The restaraunt is nice & big w/ outdoor seating as well. One thing that I LOVED was that it was SPACIOUS & clean cut... not too much decoration clutter everywhere. The high ceilings also a plus. The kitchen is an OPEN kitchen so you can see all of your food being cooked & you get all of the yummy smell of the food being prepared as well. One more thing was how CLEAN the freaken bathrooms were.   BIG FAT SPECIAL W/ FRIES & SODA $10.59 - the flame broiled beef & lamb is something I don't usually get but that's an automatic meat that comes w/ the big fat special.... I be so SURPRISED at how DERICIOUS the darn meat was & how much meat came in the gryo! You can make another gyro out of it.  SMALL GREEK SALAD $3.99 - I will have to say this was the least of my favorite.... I like my dressing a little more salty & acidic but this one was more olive oil than I would want. Still protiom wise it was pretty big for a small salad.  HUMMUS $4.99 - absolutely PERFECT flavor!!!! Just the right amount of garlic & oil w/ citrus... the pita bread was warm & fluffy  MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA W/CKN $8.99 - they use a 9\" flat bread & make a pizza out of it! The ratios were all EVEN! Chicken pieces in every bite... an OCD person's dream pizza ahhahaha",

Most of the place was already cleaned up and closed off. We were a group of 8 and no one offered us help with seating as we struggled to drag tables together to accommodate us. We expected a dining restaurant with waiters and such, but this is more of a cafe feel where you order your food at the counter and then get your own beverages. They were out of saganaki. Sadness. But I ordered the Spanakopita Plate and it was enough for two people. And all of it was good. Looking at everyone's plates, portion sizes were a definite plus. While we were eating, several people came in to pick up carry out orders. We'll be back, hopefully on a day where they have Saganaki.",

I am taking off one star because of the little amount of Tzatziki sauce that was on the lettuce and didn't make it into the sandwich and when I asked for extra side of sauce, they wanted to charge 55 cents for a little container.   It's not the money, and fine charge extra for additional sauce, but try putting on a decent amount on the sandwich in the first place.  Other than that I did enjoy it and would probably go back.",

It was the best calamari I have ever had, and I have had a lot of calamari in my lifetime. The plate was generous for the price; with salad, rice, and the fluffiest pita bread I have ever had surrounding.   The sauce that was also provided with the Calamari plate would be a world wide phenomenon if it was ever bottled and sold. I can't quite pinpoint all the flavors in it, which leads me to believe it is something special. All I can tell you is that you must try it for yourself and be enthralled in its zesty goodness as I was today.   The place is very well kept and clean with table clothes and sturdy chairs. It's as authentic as you can imagine. With authentic Greek Coffee in their Espresso Bar, Gyros, Hummus, Pita Sandwiches, and all sorts of authentic sounding appetizers and plates. They even have imported Greek Olive Oil and Greek Coffee Grounds for purchase.   The service was beyond excellent and as I was standing by the cashier to pay for my meal, I read a framed article about the place. It was then I realized that I was served by the owner himself and his family.   It was a wonderful experience and I am now determined on completing all of the menu.",

They really have a way with adding flavor with natural ingredients such as yogurt, parsley, lemon, etc. I'm thrilled this place is down the street from us, they are really tasty!   I ordered the super lemon herb chicken pita. It was a nice big freshly homemade pita stuffed silly with grilled lemon herb chicken and lettuce, also dolloped with a good amount of their creamy yogurt sauce. Squirt some lemon on that baby and eat to your heart's content. It is really refreshing and flavorful! I was completely satisfied and I also didn't feel guilty or overstuffed. Just perfect!   My boyfriend ordered the steak souvlaki combo which comes with a side of greek salad and also rice pilaf. We really enjoyed this dish! The steak was cooked perfectly tender and the seasoning was just right to where you can still really enjoy the flavor of the meat. The rice pilaf was super flavorful and addicting. Also the salad had a super light dressing that didn't overpower the flavor of the meal at all. Everything went together very well.   The greek fries were not my favorite. I'm sure it's because we ordered them to-go and by the time we got home they were soggy. But they were also lacking feta, parsley and seasoning.   Other than that, the super lemon chicken herb pita is a winner! I can't wait to try their other pitas.",

The spanakopita is perfect and the dolmas are delicious as well, not too salty like some places. The rice pudding is also a welcomed ending to the meal.",

The owner/manager is always there and more than happy to make sure you have everything you need to grab a good, home-cooked Mediterranean meal.  You can't ask for much more than that.   Hot sauce options are slight - you've basically got a big community bottle of Cholula that you might have to \"borrow\" from one of the other diners. If that's a dealbreaker, just bring your own potion and keep it secret. :) I'm gonna next time I go. Cholula is just not hot to my seared 'buds. But that's my problem, I guess!",

The staff is very friendly and kind, and food was out in a reasonable amount of time (10-15 minutes) and was so flavorful and tasty. The location was also fairly easy to find. My favorite dish is the gyro and chicken skewer. Great place for lunch and also for a quick bite.",

I get it - some places the employees having attitudes is part of the experience. Is this place supposed to be like that? If so, then forget the rest of my review. If not, then I found there to be no customer service. The employees are all yelling at each other. They don't seem to have enough people working to deal with the in person orders and to go orders and they seem so stressed out about it. They've been open for years though so I can't imagine it's anything new. The older gentleman in the back is always there working hard and is a nice contrast to the rest of the folks.  The food we got was tasty, I particularly liked the salad. The hummus is not my favorite and on a side note it was a decent portion of hummus served with 6 tiny pita triangles. My kids dipped and finished the pita in 10 seconds. Can we have a few more triangles for this big pile of hummus? No, it's $1 per pita. So another $2 was necessary to add to our $50 bill so my kids could eat the hummus. I don't mind paying for extra things but that seems unnecessary especially considering the small amount to start with.  So maybe a good place to go on a hectic lunch break, but not for a weekend lunch with your family.",

I also got a strawberry guava smoothie and that was super tasty. The hummus was good as well, I just wish they gave you more pita bread with the hummus.

The pita is stuffed with 6oz of tenderloin steak and grilled peppers while the fries are topped with generous helpings of Feta cheese. Combos run around $10+ depending on what you get. My friend always gets the steak salad and is never disappointed.  Service is always great as the family running the place treats you as one of their own.

After work, I finally decided to complete another restaraunt that was bookmarked in my app for awhile. I'm so happy that I did, because I had great experience at Yassou. The moment you walk in this place, you'll notice the Greek artwork and typical blue and white motif that is allover the restaraunt. There is a cool story along the wall about the history of the restaraunt. Greek music in the background is played throughout and the open kitchen provided a cool interaction between guests and employees.   Onto the food, everything was simply delicious from the Lemon Chicken Pita combo with Greek Fries to the Chicken Souvlaki meal was spot on. They make really good Pita bread and the Tzaziki Sauce was delicious. The Chicken was tender and really seasoned just right. Every bite of my Lemon Chicken had a refreshing taste yet balanced savory flavor. Another item that stood out was the fresh Baklava, very good and made just right. Great amount of sweetness and crunch with a moist texture. I would come back to try out more of the other dishes that they offer in the near future.  Another cool thing about this place was when I went to use the Restroom, I notice that there is a Patio to the left side facing Charleston Blvd was a cool dinning option during days when Vegas has mild weather. The Restroom was clean but I had to share this experience because when I used one of the Restroom. I immediately notice a blue bottle to the corner and couldnt contain myself because it was Windex. All I could think of was, \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding!\" LoL.  2017 Yelp Review #31",

For that they lost a star.)   My bf and I came in here and ordered the big fat gyro and the super lemon steak pita. The onions are really sharp and give you that extra crunch to your pita. Pair that with the Greek fries and you're set for an extra delicious lunch. The fries are exactly what you want. Crispy and lightly dusted with fresh parley and feta cheese. Some places can over do it. My dish was great but it was falling apart (which is why I needed the extra pita). It fell on my dish and suddenly I was full. My bf really enjoyed his meal. He typically orders his gyro without any lettuce. I keep all the good stuff in. It's a perfect hearty rainbow meal. And if you're like me you can save some for a snack later.",

    "text": "I LOVE Mediterranean food, and I have tried a lot of restaurants in Vegas, and California. I was stoked to try this spot after reading the reviews (I even ran a block in the rain to get here!), but it was mediocre at best. My absolute favorite thing in the world (other than maybe koala bears) is koobideh/luleh/lula/ground beef kebab. They didn't have it here!  Major fail.  We ordered a chicken kebab plate, their special fries, and a gyro salad.   The chicken was dry.  For me, that's inexcusable at any med place.  Their whole deal is grilling things.  If you can't grill meat, don't open a restaurant that specializes in grilling meat. Period.   The fries were kind of nice with the spices, and feta bits, but the cut was a bit too thick, and they were overall a bit greasy (even for fries). The salad was pretty good.  I would eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either.",

    "text": "I LOVE me some Mediterranean Cuisine, it reminds me of my time spent back east hanging out with my Greek, Persian, Spanish, and Turkish friends and first being exposed to new ingredients and tasty cuisines for the first time. It also reminded me of my time spent at the Wine Spectator Restaurant at The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone where the menu items we made covered flavors from the Mediterranean Regions, from Paella, Moussaka, Dolmades, Kofta, and Skordalia, to Avgolemono, Lavash, Taramosalatta, Spanokopita, and Baklava we did a little of everything. Also taking Cooking courses with Mediterranean food authority and chef Joyce Goldstein was a great bonus.  Wifey's not as big as a fan as I am, so I kinda had to sorta beg and plead and twist her arm to check out Yassou Greek Grill Cafe since we were close by...(It worked!) Yassou was a good find! Perusing the menu, I see Taramosalatta, a dip made from cured fish roe, potatoes, lemon juice and olive oil. I love that stuff and I order it as a starter.\"Whoa!?!?!? you even pronounced it correctly!?!?! Great choice!\" The guy behind the register says with a surprised look...(Refer to above paragraph)  We also shared a Lemon Herb Chicken Pita and a Souvlaki Combo. The Taramosalatta arrives and we dig in. Yassou's version was okay, but I'm used to a stronger taste of the cured roe, and I didn't really taste the potato in there, more like overkill on the olive oil. Every bite of the pita was delicious as was the combo, but the beef skewer was a tad on the dry side. Overall, a solid meal, and I still have to try out a few other spots that were highly yelped (Paymon's, Zaytoon, Parsley, Great Greek, etc.) ALOHA!!!",

The food is well super delicious. I love the grape leaves with meat inside my favorite. I have had the gyro and its so tasty. The meat is just right full of flavor exploding in your mouth. The Greek fries are my favorite fries anywhere. My go to is the lamb and chicken plate. Both meats are flavorful and good portions. Rice is made to perfection and the salad too. I haven't had the desserts but im sure they don't disappoint.",

Even beating out bigger chains like Luna Grill in California, whom I do love when im in town but if there was a Yassou in Cali I'd never step foot in a Luna Grill again. Not only are their plates mouth watering but the portions are large and very fairly priced. Large portions, financially savvy, and healthy?? It'd be irresponsible NOT to eat here! 5 stars without a doubt.",

    "text": "First, this place gets busy during lunch and there are always patrons up until closing time, It is a real food find on the west end of town.  Yassou Greek Grill Cafe is my favorite little Greek restaurant in Las Vegas.  This unassuming restaurant serves up some of the most delicious Greek food in town.  My favorite is their Chicken Souvlaki platter.  It is served with two skewers of savory, tender chicken and comes with a small salad, buttery, lemon rice, warm, fresh pita bread and cool and creamy Tzatziki sauce this meal is very filling.  Their menu has all the standard Greek favorites such as Gyros, Spanakopita, and Dolmades. Other notable menu items are the Greek Fries served crispy and hot served with spices and feta cheese. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The one drawback is the parking lot is small and hard to navigate any vehicle larger than a Mini Cooper. Yassou Greek Grill Cafe is located at 7871 W. Charleston near Buffalo, their phone number is 702-798-8989 daily hours Monday-Saturday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.   Now open on Sundays and the food/quality is excellent.",

I opted to keep it simple and tried a gyro sandwich with everything. Overall, good amount of meat and flavor. The taziki sauce was what I'd expect, but it could have used some more. Luckily my husband got his on the side so I used some of his. We also got hummus as a side. Pita bread was warm and fresh. Service was friendly and nice, with staff greeting everyone as they walk in.",

The pita was dry like it was three days old, and the sandwich itself had no flavor. Then oddly enough, on the last bite I hit a mouthful of pure salt. I had to drench it in tzatiki to make it somewhat enjoyable. The fries were hard--not crispy but hard and there was zero flavor as well which is hard to imagine. Hardly any feta, and I threw them away after eating a few. I never add salt to anything but everything needed some sort of seasoning.   The people at the counter were nice, but I don't see myself returning.",

I can't tolerate normal cheese fries with the liquid cheese that tastes like it was made in a chemistry lab, but the fresh feta cheese and spices was a perfect partner for the well done, crispy fries. I would definitely come back for round 2.",

Nevertheless, the gyro was tasty. Pita bread was soft and fresh. Meat was tender and flavorful. Big basket of Greek fries that I couldn't finish.  The fellow running the place seemed friendly. The place was certainly hopping at lunchtime. The soda dispenser is self-serve, and I made sure I got my fill of refills, since the lunch was just a tad pricey.  Certainly not the worst Greek I ever ate. Would I eat here again? You betcha.",

TOP NOTCH, FRESH CRUNCHY VEGTABLES in my salad, the most amazing dressing for the LEMON CHICKEN SALAD, literally it is to-die for. I had Given a bad review for this spot in the past because I was irritated with the system. I would call in my order from work, as i would never have time to wait in line, but then sometimes I would get here at prime lunch time rush hour and have to stand in the endless line just to pay. After I left the review, they entirely made up for this and tweaked the system, and would then allow me to run to the front of the line to make my payment and dash out with my lunch just in time to get back to work on time. THEY SAW MY (kind of rude) REVIEW AND MADE A CHANGE IN THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Jeez. Again, top notch, top of the line kind of place right here. thank you, and I love your food, Yassou is da bomb.",

I ordered the gyro plate. It comes with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, beef and lamb, and pita. I took a seat and minutes later they brought out my plate. The meat is so tender, the pita was nice and warm and the salad was fresh. My only complaint was that although the rice pilaf was soft and fluffy it was a bit too salty for me. But I still ate it and before I knew it my plate was empty and I was stuffed.   As I went to the coke machine for a refill one of the cooks came out for the kitchen and asked how was everything. I still had a mouth full of food so I gave him a thumbs up.",

    "text": "Wow this is probably the best service I have received from any restaurant in Las Vegas. While it's hard to find decent Greek food in town, I would have to say that this is probably #2 on my list. Plus they still accommodated us when we showed up 15 mins prior to closing. There were a couple items that prevented it from getting a 5-star rating. So let's break down the food.   A great way to help judge a Greek restaurant is by ordering their hummus and we did just that. They provided quite a bit of pita and croutons for you to dip in your hummus, unfortunately the hummus had no flavor. There was no lemon zest or taste of olive oil that normally comes through at other places. Heck I'm not much of a salt person and even I thought it needed some sodium.   Next up, we had their Greek fries covered in Greek seasoning, feta and parsley...I thoroughly enjoyed these. These would be so good with a gyro!  Now the main dishes - Your steak souvlaki was overcooked and tough to chew. Your chicken souvlaki was the savior as the robust flavors bursted in my mouth. Ah yes! Your lamb was tender and flavorful. Surprisingly it wasn't very greasy either.  Your tzatziki sauce wasn't as thick and tart as other places. I could swear it tasted more like sour cream than Greek yogurt, but whatever, it was still good. The rice was instant rice which was ok but I love me some homemade rice. The salad was good, mine just had a bit too much dressing.  The owner is a great guy and constantly checked on us to make sure we were satisfied with the food. Though it seems pricey, I thought for 3 people it was a great deal especially all the food we ate.",

And the portions are huge- if you get a plate, you'll have a meal for tomorrow too!  The ambiance isn't great, but let's be honest-- few places in Vegas give you that. If you're in Vegas, you aren't there for the scenery. So get over it.  I digress. Back to the food, oh God the food. The gyros are whopping fistfuls of juicy, perfectly seasoned delight. The spanakopita is just flaky enough to give you the feeling that you're eating something healthy-- but it's Greek, so you're not. The steak souvlaki..... sorry, just choked on my own drool. Perfectly tender, marinated, I'll even lick the skewers those beautiful chunks of meat are served on.  Every time I'm back in town, I make sure to stop here. Still haven't found an equivalent in my new city. I no longer believe that is possible.  ...Now I'm depressed.",

One of my friends is studying the language and soon found himself being schooled by the cashier.  The food is quite good and I have had many items on the menu.

The first time we came here, the owner was super friendly- even gave us a couple pieces of meat to sample. We ended up each getting a platter combo each (I got chicken, he got steak) but it ended up being too much food for us. All the meats they serve here are amazing, and but what really blew the meal out of the water was the rice pilaf!!   Since our first visit, my boyfriend and I have since come up with our regular order; we each get a Yassou Gyro, an order of rice to share, a couple sodas, and extra tzatziki sauce. The only thing that would make this place better is if they put more tzatziki sauce in the rear of the Gyros, usually it's all up front so when you start unwrapping the tail end, it gets dry. :(",

Upon entrance to the restaurant, almost had the feeling they were closing soon ! i had to double check the hours on the front XD !   I had ordered a steak and gyro plate. The rice was not that good. Steak was over-cooked and dry. Gyro meat was good but didnt make up for the previous too because it didnt really have any accompanyment to eat together with. Another sad thing was the pita bread couldnt be opened to make pockets for me to stuff and eat like i can at other Mediterranean/greek places.",

We each ordered the My Big Fat Gyro, and one of us had the salad + rice pilaf for an extra $2.49 while the other got the fries.  The gyros were not bad. They are a mix of beef and lamb and definitely worthy of the Fat name. We did not find them to be better than the gyros we've had in Ohio, but they were still good. I think much of the flavor came from salt, to be honest.  I was surprised by the rice pilaf, which gets high reviews. All I got was rice cooked in chicken broth- basically, yellow-hued rice with nothing more in it. That's not pilaf.  The Greek salad came with no vinaigrette- no salad dressing whatsoever. It was Greek by virtue of the feta and single olive that came with it, I guess.  The American fries were fine- just normal.",

My Souvlaki Combo never dissapoints, either protein is always cooked perfectly.  One time they were out of rice and offered Greek fries as a substitute.  It was not bad at all but I like the rice better. The dining area is usually kept clean but there's not a lot of seats inside.    There was nothing unusual about the place or food except for maybe the restrooms.  They're not gender specific so pick and choose one without feeling weird about walking into the wrong bathroom.

    "text": "BF were in the area and hungry so I popped in on Yelp to find a place and Yassou came up.   I also saw that there was a coupon for $5 off $20 here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.citycoups.com%2Fyassougreekgrillcoupon.html&s=5252f5651a705e1992d4a3ba4d521cb0935b21cb2071b3c145986c65f62e587b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">citycoups.com/yassougree...</a> so we were sold. When we got there, the lady at the counter is firm that you MUST print out the coupon off the website. Kinda a bummer considering I was already in front of their place, saw that ad and because of it decided to come in.   We shared-  Super lemon chicken pita sandwich ($6.79)- the difference with the super and regular lemon chicken is theres more meat and feta cheese in it. I think the super is the way to go since the feta helped meld the chicken, lemon, tzatziki all together. I think this is definitely something I'd get again and recommend getting here.   Gyro and Spanakopita plate ($8.59)- the gyro meat is pretty standard good, salad greens were fresh, pilaf is good, pita is soft. I appreciated that the spanakopita wasn't greasy, but it was just missing something for me so the plate over all was just okay.   It's order at the counter and find a seat so I don't have much to say about service other than what I stated above. Prices are reasonable and it's a cute little place If I'm in the area, I might stop in for that super lemon chicken sandwich but so far my overall impression is that this isn't I'd go drive all the way down for.",

Had Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese. Also comes with Tzaziki sauce but I'm not a fan of that so had them hold it. Didn't need it anyway.   Kacey ordered the Souvlaki Combo with Chicken and Steak. The chicken was really good. Steak was just ok I thought. A little tough for my liking but that may be the way its supposed to be made in that dish.  Thought about trying the baklava but it was just sitting out uncovered on top of a display cooler right next to a table where people were eating. I'll pass.  Service was decent for a quick casual spot. I'll definitely be back. They should really do some updating and freshen the place up a bit though.",

By the time it was our turn to order, the tables had cleared out some and we were able to grab a seat.  I was torn on what to get, but I was kind of hungry so instead of opting for the \"My Big Fat Gyro\" which comes with fries and a drink, I ordered the \"Gryo Plate.\"  The plate came with beef and lamb, greek salad, rice, pita bread and tzatziki sauce.  It took about 10 minutes for our food to come, but the sign at the counter says to please allow 15 minutes.   At this time I was so hungry that I grabbed a piece of pita, put some meat in it and tzatziki sauce.  I took a bite and I couldn't help but be startled by what I did next.  I uncontrollably said \"WOW!\"  I had surprised myself when I did that, but it really was that good.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The plate offers very large portions.  I felt like I got a bargain for the price that I paid.  The employees were efficient and friendly.  The place was really busy and I could TASTE why.  Next time I come I am getting the \"My Big Fat Gryo\" special with american fries and a drink.   I am hoping to eat there again soon for lunch.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The plates are so good, rice and gyro, steak plates, pita, you name it--Just get it to go, because the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired.  It's more cafeteria style than restaurant.  But the food is very good.  The steak in the steak salad is juicy and flavorful, and just the right amount.  The salad greens are fresh and perked up with herbs and a rich salad dressing.  The gyro sandwich is very generously stuffed with lamb and pork.  The french fries are meh.  The Greek fries are not quite right, either.  But get the hummus and pita instead, which is much better than the grocery store variety (if you've been getting by on that kind.)  The baklava is quite nice, rich, and not too sweet, but really sticky--in a nice way.  Try the sparking Greek water.  Call ahead and order for pick up.  It is much better than waiting, if you're going to take out (the best way to do here).  They can get backed up, and depending on who is up front, it can be a bit slow.  But believe it or not, it can even be romantic here, in the evening.",

Words cant begin to express how excited I am to have found such an incredible greek restaurant. I just spent tons of time in Greece and didn't think I'd ever be able to recreate the experience of eating the most delicious, homemade, WARM dolmades. At first I ordered the lemon chicken salad which was to die for but then I figured I'd try an order of the dolmades. Best decision I've ever made! The food came out quick, was reasonably priced and truly outstanding. Jack was helpful, nice and answered lots of my questions. He was fantastic, polite and patient with me. What a great experience- can't wait to come here as much as possible and become a regular :) thank you for such a lovely and authentic meal.",

Because that damn gyro is as big as my head! I couldn't even finish it all. Garlic fries were good as well. This is an order at the counter and take a number back to your table kind of place. They'll bring it to you, don't worry. The place has a casual diner style ambience with a nice patio and super friendly service. The pricing is perfect as well. For two people, we only spent $20 on two big fat gyro combos with greek fries (blue cheese and garlic). The restaurant and parking lot were absolutely packed when we came, and I can definitely see why. This is clearly a local gem.",

I ventured out and I`m really glad I did. This place is really good and hit the spot. I was looking for something quick yet fresh and healthy. I came to this little spot and was not disappointed.   The front counter person greeted me when I came through the door and took my order right away. I knew exactly what I wanted because I had been stalking their menu for several days online. I opted for their Greek salad with herb lemon chicken and a side of fries. Regular, please. I said \"regular\" and the guy corrected me and said \"American\". Potato. Poe-ta-toe. I didn`t want Greek fries that day, I`m sorry. Next time for sure.   I did have to wait a little while for my order(I ordered to go) but I didn`t mind. They were busy and I like places that are busy because it usually means that it is good. The salad to go container was filled to the brim with goodness. The salad was really amazing and they gave me TWO dressings(Thank you for not being cheap!). I thought it was really tasty and I wish I had one right now because I`m hungry. I want to go back and check out the rest of their offerings when I`m in town.  Go here. Go Greek. Good stuff.",

It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. i just think the rating of 4.5 stars is a bit of an over reach. either people don't know what above average is or they have no taste. the first time was the gyro platter second time was the big gyro sandwich. Both times the meat was dried out,was not moist or tender and was just an overall uninspiring meal. I also don't like being nickle and dimed for extra sauce is it really gonna break you guys? offer a proper size of sauce with each meal then customers wouldn't need to ask for it and be charged 50 cents extra. I guess i have been exposed to much better and therefore I am more critical. It seems that in las vegas anything approaching average is considered out of this world,I have seen this at many restaurants here.",

Total came out to about $12 which is not bad because the Gyro was definitely big, fat, delicious!

Whoever got there first was to find seating for all of us to sit together. There were 14 of us. My friend and I were the first to arrive, so took a look around and saw that there are three options for seating. Most people sit inside which is the same place as where you order (at the counter). But they also have an outdoor patio and a separate dining room enclosed in glass which was not open. So I asked if we could all sit in that room and they said sure and opened it up for us.  We were able to get about 4 tables put together where we all sat in a row on each side of the tables and on the ends. They brought everyone's order out to us in a reasonably consistent time. We didn't wait too long for the food either. No one had any problems with their order as far as I could tell and we had a great time with great food. Lots of the ladies were saying the food was very good.  Personally, I ordered the Super Lemon Chicken Pita. It is the larger of the two Lemon Chicken Pitas but not much more money that the smaller one. It was delicious. I forgot to tell them no onions, so I picked off the slices of red onion. I was glad they were not chopped fine!  When we left, they were loading up a van for a big delivery of food. I was impressed that they handled all of us unexpectedly at the same time they were preparing a catering job. And just as they did with us, they brought the food out to the van quickly with several people carrying things out.   I would not hesitate to return here or recommend it to anyone. Great place and I will be returning!",

But otherwise, meh.  We had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.  The service was friendly and the dining room was bright, spacious and sunny - and the presence of a coffee bar is definitely a plus - but I won't be back.",

    "text": "Best Greek Food in Las Vegas!!! Seriously the best ever! Whenever I get the cravings for Greek food or if anyone I'm with asks where to find good Greek food I always bring them here.   So if you've never been to Yassou and want recommendations on what to get I'll give you a few of my personal favorites.   As far as sides go, I always get either the Greek fries which are perfectly seasoned with big chunks of feta though out or my favorite the spanakopita which is perfectly flaky with the spinach always hot and the feta blended into it and melted all the way through. If you want to stay traditional then they have great hummus and soft pita as well.   On to the main course, I always get the super lemon herb steak pita which is amazingly tantalizing. The pita is always fresh and warm with tender with juicy bits of perfectly marinated steak and chunks of ripe tomatoes and slices of onions and lettuce and feta. It comes with a slice of lemon. Sooooo good! Also the Chicken Souvlaki is pretty good too. But the pitas are always bomb!   For dessert I always get the baklava. Theirs is the best! Fresh honey dripping off every bite.   Like I said if you want the best Greek food than try Yassou. I think it's as good as it is because it's family owned and you can tell they really care about giving their customers the best food and service they can.",

Although I've lived in the area for over thirty years and they have been open for seven, this was the first time I walked in the door (due to the yelp reviews I read on my phone). The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars, was that it looked like my home office at tax time (a bit unorganized and cluttered) with half of the chairs upside down on the tables in the middle of the afternoon.  The service was friendly, and was told that they get very busy at lunch time.  The food was superb.  It was the best Greek food I've tasted since I left Chicago thirty years ago.  The dolmodes (thank goodness not vegan) had it's ground lamb and rice spiced to perfection, and was treated to love in its lemon sauce.  The spanikopita was probably the best I have ever tasted, with its filo dough layered and flaky, and very pleasantly spiced.    If I was blindfolded and served this food on a porcelain plate with silverware, I would have paid 50% more for the meal and would have thought the food was a bargain.  I can't wait to go back and try the pastitsio and moussaka.",

It came with a side salad, rice pilaf, and pita bread.  There were four pieces of meat skewered along with a side of tzatziki sauce.  First off, I think I was expecting something else.  I was expecting more of a souvlaki wrap, as this is how I used to have it.  So that part was different for me.  It was okay, nothing spectacular though.  (I soon learned that most souvlakis served here are with pita bread, and not wraps.  So I'll have to keep my eyes out for that.)  The Husband ordered the Moussaka \"Ground beef, eggplant, and potatoes layered and topped with Bechamel sauce\" ($8.99)  It did sound a lot more appetizing and once I read it off the menu, he was easily sold.  It was okay and he said he's had better.  We also downed it with a Greek soda - blue raspberry.  Overall, Yassou Greek Grill Cafe was a decent Greek food experience.  You go up to the counter and give your order and pay.  They'll give you a number and you take a seat and your food will arrive a few minutes later.  They were pretty busy the weekend we went, so they are doing okay.  It didn't have me screaming for more though.",

Have you ever had a Gyro and thought that if it only had more of something then it would be better? Not the case here, the name explains it all. Its big, its fat, and it is yummy.   There are also a lot of other sandwiches stuffed and sides. My favorite side from here is the Dolmades. There were canned Dolmades on a shelf and I'm not sure if that's what they are serving but it definitely tastes better than any of the other places.  It's not the cheapest Mediterranean food joint but it the food justifies the prices IMO. So far I haven't had anything better along the lines of Mediterranean fast food so this is my top pick for now.",

If you do catch them open, try the lemon-herb chicken pita or any salad here. Delicious. The restaurant itself is charming and Mediterranean, in a family-style way. A bit cluttered and campy with mass-produced copies of old Aegean art and the de rigueur travel posters, but the staff is warm, welcoming and willing to accommodate any special request.  The only disappointing item on the menu is the baklava. It's among the worst I've had anywhere - shocking, considering these folks know, and produce, great Greek food. They should change the baklava immediately. It's a gaping hole in an otherwise very solid bill of fare. Don't miss this place.",

A combo with American fries and a smoothie comes in at a cool $10.99. It might seem like a lot for fast food, but once you see the gyro it is not outrageous. What is ridiculous is the thought that any single person could finish this colossal pita sandwich alone.   Yassou does give a generous portion of meat, veggies, feta, and tzatziki sauce. I was torn about the meat, because I love the crispiness, but it was also a little dry. With the amount of yogurt based dressing, it is easy to overlook. I am glad that I split this meal with my sister. By the time we finished, we were both out of commission and ready for a nap.",

    "text": "After trying a drive-thru greek stop and a couple others on Sahara, we decided to hop on to Charleston and give this place a try.  It looks so fresh and inviting in the building it's in, and because it's one of those places that you would normally drive by on a regular day, I wanted to see if it was any good.  My husband is the Greek food lover, while I am just so-so on it.  We ordered a lot--the stuffed grape leaves, two big gyros, some dessert, seasoned fries, pita bread and hummus.  Everything tasted great--the gyro was in this soft, yummy pita with some feta cheese and veggies.  The meat was really good, too.  Nicely seasoned.  The hummus was my favorite, and I had to order extra bread to finish it off.  I didn't eat the grape leaves but my husband said it was really good and had a strong herbal flavor to them.  They made this honey pastry cake and it was mildly sweet and sticky.    Overall, the food was great for a Greek stop and we frequent that place when we are in the mood for that kind of food.  The owner is there working once in awhile, and his son is there all the time.  Having a family work the business is a great sight to see, and ensures for me that they care about their food and therefore the quality there will always be good.  If you like Greek, you should give this place a shot and see if you become addicted to it or not.  Lots of yelpers are fans, and although the good was great, I'm not a total fan.  For me to give four stars it has to haunt me in my dreams.  Still, great food.",

He then offered me a sample of some rice & greens, which appeared simple to the eye, but surprisingly delicious, light & fresh.

As far as it is from my house, I doubt I'll make the drive all the way out here any time soon.  KABOBS: Doesn't Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.  SIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I've eaten better at the greek festival.   The kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.  After this meal of good and bad, I'm kind've over Mediterranean food at this point. After finishing the whole meal, I couldn't substantiate that the $25 I spent plus gas was worth it.",

Don't crack a tooth!), 3 or 4 pieces of hot pita bread, a skewer of chicken and onion pieces which are really well seasoned, and some of the best rice pilaf I have had in a while.  A fountain drink adds $2 to the total, but for $10, I left very satisfied.  Lest I forget, there is a quiet little patio if you go through the restaurant.  Service was passeable, if not overly friendly.  Interior was clean and lots of lunch regulars.  Can't wait to go back when I am off the wagon and try the Greek fries!",

I love the My Big Fat Gyro and I order it without onions. My friend ordered his without tomatoes. I know, who doesn't like tomatoes? Haha.  I was a little disappointed the last time I was in there since they got both of our orders wrong. Not a huge deal, but definitely disappointing. I also asked for ketchup and they forgot it. It's the little things that make or break the experience at a restaurant. If they had been busy, I would understand. They weren't busy.   If I was reviewing the quality of the food alone, I would give them 4 stars. Due to the not so great service, I felt I had to deduct one star. Makes me sad, but I'm sure I'll be back.",

Generally speaking, I'm not going to go out of my way to eat here.  I think there are better Greek/Mediterranean places at about the same price-point...and most of them are sit down places with more comfortable seating.   The gyros are solid here...they do their chicken gyros better than average...nothing else telling my stomach to tell my brain to come back here though.  I do love their black and white checkerboard tiles :)",

I went with the combo, gyro, fries, and smoothie shake for $10 and change.  The gyro was great...I think the feta cheese puts it on another level.  The fries were kind of plain...wish they had a sauce or seasoning....just get another cucumber sauce to dip the fries :)  The smoothie was surprisingly good...a nice touch, instead of offering a soda with the combo.  I would have went with water otherwise.  Also had a chicken pita sandwich...zesty lemon and herbs...also a good choice.  Can't go wrong here!  We will come back again!",

There is something about walking into this place and you know that it is going to have amazing food. It's set up like a mom and pop deli/restaurant outside the city limit establishment. No fancy entrance but not run down. Lot's of Greek flavor inside.  We ordered the gyro's (of course) and Greek fries. Simply amazing. The food took about 7 minutes or so to arrive at the table. Good size portions, I got the Big Fat Gyro, and I'm just happy to have finished it! The staff there is great! Very friendly and helpful.

It took a good amount of time since there were a number of orders ahead of me, but once it was ready I was so excited to dig right in to my lemon chicken and gyro Greek salad.   There was tons of meat, feta, onions and kalamata olives to accompany the lettuce. I didn't even feel the need to pour any dressing over it, since it was packed with so many delicious toppings.

It is impossible for me to truly express my gratitude to the son of the owner of Yassou, who, despite the long take out order line out the door, continually asked my mother and I if we were satisfied with our meal. Satisfied hardly does this excellent Greek Restaurant justice! The souvlaki combo was composed of moist, succulent chicken that just fell off the skewer and the beef passed the same test remarkably well. The owner's son, who waited on us, made certain that calamari was available and placed our order. 10 minutes later we had our food. Terrific portion sizes, delectable entrees and sides, and mixed greens on the side for those of us who want to up their game when it comes to nutrition. Best Greek food this side of town? Hands down the best! Thank you for being close by and I will definitely be back soon as well as often!",

Now that I'm living in Vegas I've had a chance to not only become a regular here but have had a taste of other similar restaurants within the valley.  Every place has their strengths and weaknesses but at the end of the day I tend find my way back to these guys, even though it's a bit of a drive for me since I don't live close.  They always ask me how the food is and I usually tell them (sarcastically) that it $uck$, which of course is the exact opposite of the experience.  Great food, great prices (check out the souvlaki specials), and most importantly the owners and their employees are great.  As I'm walking out the door at lunchtime, reiterating my sarcastic response to how I enjoyed my meal, Christian responds by saying that he'll see me back for dinner.  If I lived closer that would probably be True  There's definitely no shortage of good Greek restaurants in Vegas.  If you haven't tried Yassou, definitely do.

They're always working hard to keep the food flowing and the restaurant clean.   My only problem is deciding what to order! I usually end up getting a gyro, lemon herb chicken salad, or the mini souvlaki special. There were a few occasion that I noticed the meat was ever so slightly on the dry side. More of an observation than a complaint, nothing that a little lemon or tzatziki can't fix. Everything is well seasoned and flavorful. I'll have to come back more often.",

I can tell they were busy so I patiently waited. 20 mins passed, nothing yet, 25 mins - nothing yet. Then, I saw her looked at the bags that were already on the counter and she called my name after the 30 minute mark. That's just poor customer service and inefficiency on their part. So all together it took 48 minutes to get my food!!! My groceries were waiting in the hot car for 30 mins!!! I had to throw away my eggs, yogurts, and milk! It cost me more money than it should have been. I don't think I'll go back. Their food hasn't been tasting that good in the past couple of trips anyway.",

About two months ago I ordered something new...Moussaka an eggplant & ground beef dish with potatoes layered and topped with Bechamel sauce. It was so good I went back 3 times in just one week.   Last month I ordered the Salmon plate. A large 8 oz center cut filet and a Greek salad... OMG so good.   The quality of food and the size of the portion... it's hard to know how they do it. The prices are amazing really amazing.   I have owned and operated a very successful restaurant when I was younger and went to culinary school.  I also have been to the Greeks Islands and Athens. This is the best Greek food I've had in the states 100%  I'm sitting here think I will try the Spanakopita... Spinach & Feta wrapped in flaky fillo next. I'm really looking forward to lunch Tue at Yassou.",

Chicken lunch special is my go to favorite; marinated chicken on a skewer, Greek salad with onions, tomatoes, zucchini, feta and onions, fresh pita bread with tzatziki sauce and lemon rice. This fills me up all day long. So healthy, delicious and a great value. When it's cold outside I recommend the avgolemoni soup; homemade delicious blend of creamy lemon, chicken and rice. And I can't forget the baklava - crispy, cinnamon, nuts with a splash of rose water. My boys like the Greek fries topped with feta and parsley. Delicious fresh brewed iced tea and fountain drinks to choose from. Many other Greek favorites here too.",

But, the pita bread isn't really all that great for my taste though. The rice is great here, and the chicken is well seasoned, moist, and delicious. The Greek salad is also on point.

Everything is so fresh.  The salads are green, the salad dressing is very tasty, everything doesn't taste like it's just been sitting out all day, then warmed up.  Oh, and i love the cucumber dipping sauce that comes with the spanikopita...It's da bomb.  By the way, the prices are great.  Any time, a meal for 2 is about $20... that's a deal in my book!! Oh and omg, I forgot to mention their baklava.  I think it's the best in town, ever.  So good, that I ordered a pan of it for my bday party.  It was a hit and they made the whole process of it very easy.  I just had to return the pan the following day and got my deposit back for it. The owner, the son and the staff are very friendly and they take pride in their business.  They know their customer's faces and names.  Since I live close, I'm kind of a regular, haha.  I also love taking my friends and family who are from out of town to this place.  They always tell me how good the good is and how fresh it is.   Give it a try, even the vegetarian menu, I know you will like it too!!",

After the disaster that is the Mad Greek, I was afraid I would be inclined to allow my distaste to taint my review of Yassou, so I made sure to try it a couple of times.  Don't ask me to remember the names of my orders, other than there's always a gyro and usually some dolmades. What I do remember is that they always put my Tzatziki sauce at the side. Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, just not always slathered on like they do at some places.  The gyro was really good, with the perfect combination of ingredients so you could enjoy each bite, with sauce or without.  The dolmades are always wonderful - just knowing they're hand made is a huge plus n my book.  I am so looking forward to the festival next month, I hope the food there is as good as Yassou does it, or better even.",

I love everything about the food - plain and simple. To give some perspective, I eat Greek/Mediterranean cuisine 3 times a week on average; and I refuse to order from any other restaurant in this category. Why? Because Yassou has thoroughly impressed me every single time.  Let's start with service quality. I would give these folks 6 stars out of 5 if it was possible. From my understanding, Yassou is a restaurant run by multiple generations of a single family - a family that is truly passionate about what they do. As soon as you step foot in the restaurant, you get the feeling that every employee loves where they work. In a perfect world, every restaurant would evoke these sentiments in their customers. And how about the food? Outstanding food quality and generous portions makes Yassou my absolute favorite Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. Always fresh and high-quality ingredients make every dish a winner. I'm a huge fan of both the greek salad and the gyro + chicken kebab combo plate. The protein is perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor, and the rice is nothing short of delectable. Do yourself a favor and give Yassou a try!",

I really can't say enough about this place- highly recommended!",

He made a beautiful veggie plate and made sure that no mistakes were made with feta cheese! The price for the taste is ridiculously cheap and the employees have great conversation skills and make you feel welcomed! Loved this place and I will be coming here again for those amazing dolmades and salad!",

    "text": "So let me start off with I'm a food driver and I'm usually delivering this food on one of the platforms although today I thought I would give them a try for my lunch. The people are always welcoming from the from all the way to the back where usually I'm greeted by not only the cashier but the guy that runs the show in the back. It took about 15mins for a steak souvlaki plate which is more ham reasonable when everything is made to order. The meat was tender and juicy it came with some veggies also on the skewer which just helped enhance the flavor no doubt the rice was some of the best I've had in town and the pita bread was made to perfection. The fries were just fries but to be honest after the bread steak and pilaf I really wasn't interested in the fries. Thanks to the entire staff I will be back!",

    "text": "We have been going to Yassou for at least 10 years and have always loved it (and still do). However if today were our first visit I am not sure how we would have felt. First things first the cashier (I believe her name is Sara) was somewhat rude. When she informed my wife that the red caviar spread was not available she rushed my wife on making a decision on which sauce she wanted extra of. This may have been acceptable if there was a line but we were the only ones ordering. Christian was working hard on the line so I am not sure if he was aware of the shape that the restaurant was in, once again if this was our first time we would have a really bad perception of Yassou.  During our dinner there was another woman cleaning, not a bad thing but the mop water was so strong with bleach that it somewhat interfered with our meal. There were two couples that came in after us and each had a less than stellar experience. The older couple seemed to be almost harassed for asking for an extra plate while the young family seemed to get attitude for requesting the fries and pita they ordered.   We have been avid visitors of Yassou and have recommended it over the other Greek restaurants in town so it was sad to see today be so off. Christian and his family work hard to make it a great experience and I commend him for having such an authentic and delicious restaurant. Maybe there was something in the air or everyone was just way over stressed but today was really just not a good day at Yassou. I really hope stuff like this doesn't end up hurting them as it is our favorite Greek place in town.",

Our food literally took 25min and it wasn't even that busy! The food was not very well seasoned and pretty bland! I would definitely not come back to this place and wouldn't recommend to anybody!

I was so looking forward to some authentic Greek food and this is way out the way for me but I found myself on that side of town and decided to try it out. The moussaka was good but barely warm and the spanakopita was severely undercooked. I told them and he remade it but it was still very doughy and not crispy like I'm used to. The service was spectacular and the people were so kind I wanted to like it all but I didn't. I did love the watermelon cucumber drink. It's sad that a drink was the best thing I had there though",

I'm a fan of Greek Mythology and had only had Greek food once before, and thought this place with the Greek lettering and broken pillar logo looked quite inviting.  Plus, it was very close to CSN.  My favorite thing to order is the My Big Fat Gyro w/o onions... because, well, who likes onions?  You get a great, heaping helping of lamb, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, and tzatziki sauce.  The Greek fries are also yummy-- I think they are sprinkled with a touch of lemon, and then lots of feta cheese.  The owners are amicable and if you're unsure of what to order, they can make great recommendations.  One of my friends hadn't had lamb before, and they sliced a sample off the rotisserie just for her to try.  They also sell the pita bread they use on their gyros.  I'm so happy that a mom and pop place that actually serves quality food is surviving this economy.",

What's my order? \"Gyro-Chicken salad, meat well-done  to go!\" This is the best way to order, I know because I'm the \"DUKE\"  Chicken well done am I insane? No! Trust me when you order the chicken well done, it ends up being crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside because of the marinated lemon juice.  As for the Gyro being well done, that should be mandatory at all gyro places due to the questionable meat, but I make it a point to do so. Plus, i like my gyro meat that way because it ends up tasting like bacon.  \"To go\" because of the Panda Express rule. Your just get more and  It is served in a nice container with dressing on the side. If you order to eat there, it's served on a plate and the dressing is way too wet for the salad.     So the whole order is sort of like a chopped chicken salad with feta instead. I forgot about the small bits of fried pita that taste like heaven!",

Spanakopitas are kind of like spinach & feta turnovers.  I should warn new-comers, they don't make falafels. According to the owner (who is a nice man that loves his restaurant), falafels are Mediterranean, but not Greek. He only serves strictly Greek food. At first I wasn't sure about the place, because of that, but it helped me try new foods that I probably wouldn't have given the chance otherwise.  It's definitely worth trying!

I always get the gyros and spankopita! The gryos meat juicy, spot on cooked, as is the spankopita, and awesome greek salad (love the dressing, nice black greek olives, nice feta chesse, cucumbers) and rice. The price really REALLY affordable talk about food for under $10 get money worth! I tried the baklava normally never have enough room by the end. I had lunch with friends visiting decided too try much different things off the menu. Dessert was one of them. Nice. Really sweet and rich but then again that the only way I think of baklava! Music playing is authentic Greek music. You truly get that feeling of old school family (hold less then 80 people?) run restaurant. Not chain restaurant and tell the quality of the food feels like family secrets from one generation too another.   The staff is really friendly and visitors in town not normally eat greek food had questions. The server was very attentive and answered all of my friends questions.   The parking ample parking in front of the building the only thing gets me each time. I tend too miss the entrance for that little shopping complex. It tends too sneak up on you and that the only entrance for that shopping area. I had too turn around. Still for piece of Greek heaven so worth it! =)))",

We did a search on Yelp, read the reviews and found Yassou! I was interested in the Souvlaki Plate and the guy taking our order pointed out a special that was less expensive and was a smaller lunch portion - which was exactly what I was looking for! The platter contained a skewer sampler of chicken, steak and pork and I asked for double greek salad instead of rice. All the meat was cooked nicely and seasoned well. The salad was fresh, the pita was fluffy and tzatziki was delicious. Hubby got the Big Fat Gyro and said that it was tasty and satisfying. We were too full for the Baklava but saw it and will have to give it a try next time! I highly recommend this if you are in the neighborhood and need a satisfying Greek lunch or snack!",

My Big Fat Gyro 5.79 Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese.  This was tasty and had a lot of flavor to it.  Because it was so fat, it was hard to put my mouth around it.  That didn't sound too good, should I have written this differently so it doesn't so graphic?  All jokes aside, this is definitely a no joke gyros. 2.)  Greek Fries  $2.69 I have had better greek fries.  For some reason, this was more bland than the other ones I've had in other restaurants. 3.)  Veggie Spreads Plate 7.49 A delicious assortment of Hummus, Tzakziki, Taramosalata & meatless Dolmades.   I felt this one was lacking something.  The rice was just so bored on its own, and I found the salad to be just okay.  Everything else on the plate was pretty good.  As for texture, there wasn't much added to it.    I rated it A-Ok because it's just that, A-Ok.",

I was enjoyed my meal very much, the traditional gyro was so flavorful and the chicken kabobs were easily eaten on the stick, i wasnt a fan of the baklava the ratio of filo and filling wasnt even there was to much filo and not enough filling but other than that the meal was fantastic",

He seemed friendly on a personal basis with several of the customers there which is a good sign (repeat customers).  I decided to get Yassou gyro combo with Greek fries. I was very impressed with the gyro. It was delicious.  The greek fries were good, but not impressive.  The spices advertised must have left out.  I got regular fries with feta cheese and a little greenery on top, but they are only fries. I'll take a good gyro over fries any day. I look forward to trying out more of their menu.",

He seems nice and he was really working. A small piece of advice that I could leave would be for the employees to not go smoke on their break by the people dining outside. Also, there are no pictures up so if someone asks a question about the menu there is no need to be annoyed. One last thing, maybe you should bring everyone's food out at the same time. It's awkward for one person to be eating the the other person doesn't get their plate for another 15 minutes and they're left to eat alone.",

I found the side of greek salad lacking a bit, it had enough cheese & dressing, but otherwise was all lettuce (only one olive).  I would have liked to see more \"stuff\" in the salad.    The \"lamb\" was a little dry, not ready to believe its always this way though. Having only eaten here once, this may have only been the luck of the draw, not sure. I will certainly try it again.",

And the staff is great.  I sometimes pick up food to-go to take to my guy who lives five hours away in the mountain with no Greek, no Asian, no nothing food around and they are awesome enough to fulfill my request in separating certain things to prevent sogginess/etc.  Usually order the Big Fat Gyro, or the dinner places of lamb/beef.  I've had the chicken slouvaki and that was delicious as well.  I'm going to try and make some lemon rice because their's has inspired me so much.",

The prices are very fair for what you get, and because it is \"fast-casual\", you don't really need to tip-a dollar or two is sufficient (IMO).  Food is fresh and very good.  It's a smaller place and not fancy, but it is VERY clean and is quite attractive.  The only negative is that they close rather early for my tastes (around 8 PM), and I really like to eat around 9 on weekends.  It's definitely worth a try-it's sort of \"out of the way\" in a retail/office building next to McDonald's on Buffalo and Charleston.",

Anyway, the service was very friendly and I ordered the chicken special for lunch, which was 1 souvlaki skewer, salad, rice, tzatziki and pita. The bf ordered the super lemon chicken pita. My chicken souvlaki was nice and moist, but the salad was drenched in dressing that seemed to be dumped on top of the lettuce and not tossed through. That's a pet peeve of mine...hate getting one bite of dry salad and then the next bite swimming in dressing. Small thing, but kinda ruined the salad for me--the feta on it was yummy though. The tzatziki was ok,  but I've had better. It just tasted a bit processed or something--can't quite put my finger on it.   Overall we both thought the food was good, but it wasn't so spectacular that I can't wait to go back. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely stop in there again for lunch if I was in the area, but I prob won't go out of my way to make a special trip over there.",

Uses Kronos gyro meat which I like better than even homemade ones I've had and they must sell enough that Pitts are fresh. However, I wouldn't get a Greek salad or any of the sides like tiramusalata etc. I ordered a few because I love all those sides. They were very disappointing. Grape leaves were so so (there is one place that has by far the best in town). I was told once a week they make their own, but the ones I had tasted like the canned ones, which are fine but not what I was hoping for in a mom and pop place. Greek food is tough in Vegas, which is why it's generally first stop when I go home. I was really hoping for better, and I'll still go back when I want a gyro because really those were excellent but if I want Greek food, I'll wait till I head out of town still.",

A quick look on Yelp showed me a highly rated Greek gyros about 10 minutes away. Hell yeah!  I arrive but realize the private parking is on the other side of the building. I parked by McDonald's but it was a 30 second walk to the restaurant.   I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff member who explained what the Greek Fries were and the combos and stuff. The Greek Fries are worth the extra dollar and change. I finished the fries before even touching the gyro. The whole meal was about $12 for a really good gyro (not too soggy, plenty of lamb or whatever meat, fresh lettuce, and onions mmmm), the awesome Greek Fries, and a fountain drink.  The atmosphere is great too. I enjoyed the Greek music and look/cleanliness of the establishment. There's an area outside and a closed off area.  I didn't see the bathrooms but I bet they're clean too.   Overall, really great experience. Excellent staff, good food, and decent prices ($7.89 I think for just the gyro).  I'd definitely come a lot more if I didn't live on the other side of town!",

One chicken skewer (seasoned and cooked perfectly), rice, side salad (with the best Greek dressing ever) and pita bread w/ a side of tzatziki, all for less than $10. If you're feeling extra hungry, order the Greek fries - you won't be disappointed. Fries with feta, parsley, and I believe a squeeze of lemon (?). Yummy!  Be prepared because they do get very busy during lunchtime, but it's worth it!  They are family owned and nice people. They also own the dry cleaner in the same strip mall (super reasonable prices) so you can kill two birds with one stone!",

As for taste, no it's probably not the best I have ever had, but for me, I order the chicken souvlaki plate or greek salad with chicken and I am happy with it consistently. The pita on the salad is very buttery and I believe fried, so not exactly the healthiest, but good. The dressing is excellent and I always ask for it on the side since they tend to go heavy on the dressing. It somehow always seems to be mixed in every time, but when I ask them about it, they say it's the marinade from the chicken that gives it that taste or feel that the dressing was still mixed it, but they say it wasn't. The people working there know us by face now and it always seems to be the same people working, I know the owner is always there, but the other guy might be his son? He is always there too.   The chicken and rice soup is really yummy but sometimes they don't have it, especially over the summer. My hubby orders the steak skewers or gyro and isn't as impressed with this place as I am. Friendly workers, quick food, and affordable is a plus in my book.",

Pita bread and hummus are to die for (great texture with a wonderful hint of lemon). We sampled the Gyro (incredibly flavorful and a generous portion) and the Chicken Souvlaki (great use of spices to enhance and  not overpower the food). BTW, the restaurant is immaculate, the decor is attractive, prices reasonable and you'll experience real attention to detail.  Service is friendly, helpful and responsive.

This is about as authentic a Greek dining experience you'll find (and as someone who lives in NYC, that says a lot)..  I ordered the big fat gyro and rice/greek salad. With a fresh iced tea, the total was $11, a True bargain. Also of note, the staff (from the son at the register to the owner, exactly as you'd picture a Greek chef, working his magic in back, to the pleasant food runners) couldn't have been better.  The food: the gyro literally is big and fat, but the perfect combination of meat (beef & lamb), veggies, tzatziki and feta. It's not too big that you can't pick it up, but literally perfect. A top 5 gyro among the many I've eaten in life. The salad and rice was good, but nothing too special. The Greek fries I saw headed to other tables looked delicious, but you need to draw the line somewhere.  Overall, amazing food, great staff and more. Do yourself a favor and eat here if you're ever nearby!",

I consider this place to be far superior to Paymon's and all the other Americanized versions of Greek food that you can find here in town.  As for Lapriel H., that yelped about the man behind the counter was a Will Farrell look-a-like, etc. etc....................if you had read the literature on the wall, you'd have noticed that the man you're referring to is the owner, originally from Cyprus,  and  he spends 14 hours a day there both cooking and interacting with the patrons.  ~I recommend the Big Fat Gyro.......oh my, it's AMAZING!  It's a mixture of lamb and  beef and the meat is sooooooo tender!  The veggies are fresh and crisp and the feta is of a good quality!  The size of this thing resembles its name.......BIG & FAT! ~The Greek fries are fantastic..........a taste of lemon, parsley, salt and feta! ~And lastly, the Baklava.........what!!!!!!  I compare every single piece of Baklava that I eat to my mother's, who in my opinion, still makes the very best, but this was fantastic in so many different ways!  For those people who like Baklava for its traditional flakiness........this will satisfy your taste buds but with quite a twist.  It's covered with a honey sauce that makes it mushy to just the right degree......almost a cake like texture.  I can't describe it, can't put it into words..... ~It's a casual, near fast food type place with a very homey atmosphere!   A+",

    "text": "IMO this is one of the very best Greeks I have ever been to, and I've been to plenty in England and here in Vegas.  Here's what I think makes it stand out:  1) It's a family run business with the owner always on hand to make sure the quality stays perfect and consistent.  Everybody we have dealt with there has been super friendly and makes us feel at home.  2) I know, it's really all about the food.  Well everything we've had here has been great:    Everything is made to order, so when you get the chicken or steak kabob, it's not been sitting around then zapped in the microwave like some places I've been to, instead it's cooked perfectly on the grill, the chicken moist and tasty (I recommend you squeeze a bit of extra lemon on it for a final taste burst), the steak unbelievably tender and cooked about medium rare for a fantastic juicy chunk of meat you'd be happy to find in your best steak house.  The donner kebab is nicely browned on the outside and very tasty; I've been to far too many places where they don't make the effort to brown it before slicing it off, it makes a huge difference to the taste when it's done right.  The rice is super moist and flavorful, I imagine they are cooking it in some sort of broth.  The side salad on the plate has a nice amount of dressing and a good variety of feta, olives (but only a couple), cucumber and onion to go with the lettuce.  The pitas are not home made (there are hundreds of them on display in packages) but they are very yummy, more doughy than the usual thin ones.  If I had one recommendation I'd like the option to have them warmed on the grill.  I think the prices are extremely reasonable considering the large portion size.  Friendly family run business, reasonable prices, great food.  We can't wait to go back.",

Which I think should come with it since it kinda was a gyro salad.   My girlfriend ordered a plate and it came with so much food! I loved the pita bread they have here because it's so soft and fluffy! How I like my bread.   Can't wait to come back and try their actual gyros!",

When I walked into Yassou, I was greeted by Greek music and a bunch of Greek memorabilia on the wall. I love that kind of stuff and made me wish I was still in Greece.  I ordered the moussaka and it came with a Greek salad, tzatziki, rice, and pita slices. The moussaka had a huge crispy layer of bechamel at the top, but just a little too much for my liking. It tasted great though. The rice was cooked well and was seasoned great.  The pita was good and I love tzatziki no matter what. Everything to cooked for order and the service was very quick.  I will definitely be back in the future to try some different dishes!",

We certainly do not regret it because we had a fabulous meal together at Yassou!  Customer service was great. Friendly people behind the counter, especially (I'm assuming) one of the owners who served us, asked how our food was and bid us goodbye on our way out.   The food is delicious. My mom had the Tuna Mykonos Pita, I had the Super Lemon Herb Steak Pita & we shared the Greek Fries. Mom loved her super chunky, lemony albacore tuna pita with tomatoes and onions and the magical sauce. Lol. I also had the same condiments and veggies but mine came with seasoned, tender steak bites. The herb and feta cheese-topped fries were crispy and were a great pair to our pitas.  The ambiance of the place is casual and I would expect it to be super packed around rush hour cause it's not a very huge place. I must say too that the place is warm inside, we were a bit sweating while eating our food even when sitting in a shaded table so that was a little uncomfortable. All in all though, we are definitely coming back to try the Gyro and the Rice plates since everyone is raving about them!",

The meals are all big and will definitely fill you to the brim.  The appetizers are a decent size and easy to share.  The hummus here is really, REALLY good too!  Always a good sign for a Greek joint.    And the gyros....Oh the gyros!  I think they have the best Gyros in town hands down. In fact I often dream about the Big Fat Gyro and always wake up happy just thinking about. If you haven't been yet, go RIGHT NOW and get one, maybe two!  The meat is tender and packed with flavor!  The pita is so soft and fluffy. And the tzatziki sauce is amazing!  Yum, yum, yummy!  So the moral of the story is if you want some great Greek food, get to Yassou's now!",

My favorites to get are the chicken + steak souvlaki combo and the lemon herb chicken pita. I get the souvlaki combo when I want pita bread and their amazing rice pilaf (best rice pilaf I've ever had by the way). I get the lemon herb chicken pita when I'm craving that flavorful ultra juicy chicken. The chicken pita comes with an extra container of juice, like OKAY I SEE YOU YASSOU!! Serving the extra juices as if it's not ridiculously juicy enough. On top of that, the price point is really good for the large portions they give you.  Yassou never fails to deliver amazing food while still being pretty healthy!",

There's not one thing I don't like from that meal-- first off, the chicken is so juicy and flavorful, the rice pairs so well with the chicken, Greek salad is my favorite, and you can never go wrong with pita and hummus. Not only is the food delicious but they aren't greedy with their portions either-- it's a lot of food on that plate and I always end my meal with a happy tummy. I want to try more things on the menu but that chicken skewer plate is sooo good I feel like I just can't steer away from it.  I will for sure be back and I have already been telling most of my friends about this place. I literally had to get this again the next day after trying it for my first time so that my boyfriend try it too.",

I believe if you paid $45 for the meal they should eat the dollar so that the customer can come back again... I guess customer service doesn't exist anymore it's all about the dollar bill",

Having seen the banners around town for a Greek Food Festival, I knew I had to try Greek food!  After doing enough research on Yelp, I decided on Yassou's Greek Grill. Their prices are affordable (~$10 a person) and their menu is easy to understand. It's not complicated, mostly because everything is delicious. My boyfriend and I usually get a gyro plate and a gyro sandwich. The beef and lamb meat is succulent (their lemon herb chicken skewers too), the pitas are warm and soft, the tzatziki sauce is refreshing- but the star (at least for me) is their rice pilaf.  It. Is. To. Die. For. Writing this review actually has me in tears because I don't have rice pilaf in front of me as I'm reminiscing about it. The food here is flavorful and yummy, and as a result has drawn a good amount of attention and a crowd! They can get busy sometimes, but they provide the best service that they can.  Yassou's is definitely a more diner/cafeteria style dining experience, so it's not the place to take a fancy date- but it is DEFINITELY a place for a rocking, delicious date with some authentic food.",

The salad just looks on appetizing because the croutons look burnt. The hummus is very runny and hard to stick on the pita bread because it runs off. Also, I ordered it from postmates, and I ordered saganaki which did not come. I am very disappointed by this because saganaki is my favorite Greek food and it was what I was looking forward to.

I'll say it's better to dine in for the sake of no confusion as to whether they are speaking to you; versus ordering by phone.  Much more charming to have your meal indoors.  Cultural music is played, sorta gives the feel.  Their walls are white and blue as you would find iconic in Greece.  Although it was extremely warm walking in, they turned on the a.c. and it cooled up pretty quickly.  Yassou is busy during lunch hour, and they do work fast.  I saw them brooming up under tables inside and outside, cleaning off tables as guests were through.  Not so spic and span, but average dining areas.  It's great that they have outdoor seating especially right now in November afternoons, Vegas still has pleasantly warm weather, sunny and blue skies.  I'll give yay points for their food being tasty.  We ordered Greek pasta with gyro (spaghetti with brown butter imported mizithra cheese) and a Gyro plate.  They're winners; again a lot of food on one plate and average prices.  Cannot get over their yellow rice - so yummy!!!",

    "text": "So decided to check out this place after seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp.  I'm a fan of Greek food, despite not having eaten at all of the Mediterranean restaurants in the valley.  For my initial visit, I decided on the Big Fat Gyro combo which included \"Greek\" fries (garlic and feta) and a fountain soda ($12). Their menu was quite large and encompassed a very nice range of specialties I look forward to checking out on future visits.  I arrived on a Thursday around 11:30 and was greeted by a friendly cashier.  After paying for my order, it magically appeared about 10 minutes later. Opa!!   The gyro was neatly wrapped in foil, and about a third of it was poking out, revealing tasty looking meat topped with tzatziki sauce and feta crumbles.  I was disappointed the meat didn't seem to have very much flavor; typically used to stronger Greek spices and flavors in the gyro meat, this was much more mild.  The pita was decent and definitely not fresh made, as stacks of pre-packaged pitas were displayed 10 high.  Anyway, it was pretty good.  I did notice the owner, Mr Pappas, to be working his tail off preparing nearly every dish himself.  This proud owner only had the assistance of another guy who helped him out when he had a chance.  His red faced determination was evident as he rarely stood still and ensured every dish was prepared as it should be.  Las Vegas needs to continue to support local, hard-working businessmen like Mr Pappas.   Look forward to my next visit when I plan on ordering Souvlaki platter with side of hummus.  Can't wait.",

I had two orders, one was stale and inedible and my other one was soft warm and fluffy.   This place is tucked in on charleston and buffalo, and is always filled with hungry customers!

However, today I had a really amazing experience that I wanted to share.   I entered the Yassou Grill and was warmly greeted. That was a great start. But not worth reviewing over. Most places greet customers. Still...great start. I'm a district manager of a local business so I take my shop managers out to lunch during visits. At least once a month. This manager recommended that we head to this location. I ordered the gyro and she ordered a gyro salad and also added  a hummus appetizer. Let me tell you...the very best hummus I have ever eaten. Smooth, no over spiced. Just perfect! While I was eating I took some time to look around. Really clean and open atmosphere. Then the sandwich and salad arrived. So so fresh. I have been to so many greek restaurants in Las Vegas but this one was by far the freshest. Wonderful gyro meat, perfectly seasoned sauce. Even the tomatoes were as if that where picked fresh from a garden. The total package. As we left they thanked us for the business and invited us to come back. Really cool. This review may seem over the top. However, please check my account. I never review! I highly recommend this place. Good service, great food, and amazing customer experience.   Thank you Yassou Grill, I'll be back!",

The plate is fun, but the gyro wrap is hands down the best beast you'll wrangle during your work week. They're massive. I find myself picking out slices of meat to pack it smaller. My husband can go to town on it without much of a mess, but he has man hands and a man mouth.   That gyro meat is a shaved beauty, how I'd imagine gyros or shawarma should come off (if you ask a foreigner like me). I'm always prepared to get one bad piece, just one. Maybe a piece of fat or ligament, but nope, hasn't happened yet.   We call ahead and do takeout most of the time, and probably won't change the routine up anytime soon. Can't beat these prices.

    "text": "we discovered this place about a year ago and have always enjoyed the food but today's experience was horrible.  We have put up with the high prices (2 plates & 1 drink always seem to come out to $20+) & super long wait time, (for a FAST food place) but today was the worst.  In order to avoid waiting the usual 15+ minutes I called ahead.  When my husband paid, the cashier got the order wrong that had been given over the phone.  My husband had to correct her a few times in the same transaction.  We thought it was strange we were not given a receipt or a table number.  Over the phone they had told us it would be ready in 10 min but it took 19.  We were once again waiting.  Also, over the phone I had said I was calling in advance to eat there, yet they set up our food in to go boxes - but didn't give us a bag...I don't understand the logic there.  When we got the food both to go boxes had smeared food marks on them - looked very unsanitary & unprofessional, and the order was wrong STILL.  We had been charged $2 for the extra rice my hubby ordered, but it appeared that they simply substituted his salad for a small amount of rice because the salad was missing altogether!  To make it right, they quickly (for once) made a salad to go, but even THAT box had smears of food or whatever on it.  GROSS!  The one good thing about this place is that the food always tastes great, but after this experience we may be looking for a new local Greek place.",

It quickly became my favorite Greek places to eat.  Silly me, I always order the Gyro...I've got to try other menu items !!  I'm very picky about what I eat, and Yassou has never let me down.  Family-run business, reasonable prices, excellent food and friendly service where they actually recognize me!  In a city of 2 million people, it's really great to get noticed as a repeat customer.  I won't eat Greek anywhere else...this place is consitantly marvelous & yummy !!!!!",

The chicken was fantastic and the gyros as well. I recommend the beef and chicken kabob. Get the baklava as it is baked fresh (as is all their food) and is made from scratch on site. The owner was very friendly and accomodating.We went back the next day we liked it so mush.  My Dad loved the lemon chicken soup and like everything elseit is made from scratch. I don't know why they do not have a cafe n the strip. All thumbs up from both of us.",

I'm very glad I did. First of all, the people are very friendly and gave us a sample of the Greek custard dessert they had, which of course we purchased.   My friend and I both got the gyro plate and were both pleased. The beef/lamb was seasoned just right and I loved the salad and rice that the plate comes with. I usually don't eat the rice, but theirs was good. Now for the custard dessert...wow, this was delicious. It was a generous piece that my friend and I shared, warm custard, topped with phyllo and of course, some honey. Highly recommend.   I'm looking forward to going back!",

I got the under $8 lunch special with a chicken and a beef skewer, greek salad, pita and rice (oh the rice! 'wasn't expecting mild mannered little grain like rice to be such a star!) The chef (whom I could see from my seat) even took time out from cutting up fresh cucumber (by hand) to make sure I was enjoying my order.

We were referred by Pete and while we were there all we saw was him interacting with customers, cooking, helping everyone out, and working hard! For me personally besides the food, good customer service is very important to me. I love small businesses and I prefer going to a family owned place over a chain restaurant. My mom works at a local Walgreen's and had Pete as a customer who told her about his store and that's how we ended up learning about it. While my mom lives in Summerlin i live in Seven Hills and I can honestly say I will make the drive to get take out/dine in again. Its businesses like this that will make it very far :)",

It seemed like most of the people who came in were regulars, or they treated them that way. I can't say enough nice things about how awesome the service was. Now to the food. I had a Big Fat Gyro Sandwich that was yummy. My only complaint was that it needed more tahini sauce (again, you can never have too much!) but I stole some from my dining partner.

I can't say that I've eaten at every Greek place in LV, but I can say that none of the other places I've tried have come close.  Let's start with what to expect, the employees/owners do not seem to be the most service oriented people. Some days they greet you with a hello, other days they convey a sense of \"hurry up and order\". I would like to go on record as stating that I don't believe this is a bad thing. I don't care if the staff doesn't hug and comfort me in times of need, I just want good food which is exactly what Yassou provides.   Their prices are fair given the quality and size of the plates they serve. I usually end up spending 10-15 dollars a meal. The thing that really sets them apart for me is their meats. Cooked perfectly, not dry, not tough, and definitely not bland.   They offer a few of those \"powder from a box\" smoothies, not good at all, but again, what really makes this place worth visiting is the food.   For all you folks who feel limited by \"doors\" and \"walls\", they have tables outdoors which is a plus.",
