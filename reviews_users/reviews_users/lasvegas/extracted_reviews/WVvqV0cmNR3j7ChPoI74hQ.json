The blackeyed peas tasted like they were straight out of a can, no seasoning, had to keep adding salt and pepper to everything.  Plus they had no greens!!   Soul food place with no greens??   Had cabbage instead; it was horrible, swimming in water, no seasoning.  Potato salad was awful. I will give them a second chance. Hopefully it will better.",

The first time I came it was on a Aand  I got there about 10:30 and they were not serving Lunch yet, the waitress told me that they didn't start to serve lunch until 11:00 which was fine. I then went on to order some liver and onions and let me tell you it was absolutely delicious. Okay so the next weekend my sister and I went back to the restaurant for lunch at 11:00 and the waitress (the same one from the previous week) told that Lunch wasn't until 1:00. Like what? first of all the time of opening hours on the door is 3 1/2 hours wrong, I was here last weekend and you told me that lunch isn't until 11:00 and now you are saying that it isn't until 1:00?! lady please. I left. They really need to get it together over there because even though the food was tasty the previous week, the service sucks!!",

    "text": "HOLY SHIT, MOTHER OF GOD, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!    First off, I am planning to file a lawsuit against this place -- because they have MADE ME ADDICTED TO SOUL FOOD!!!!!   Second, if you can't hear me, that is because you might be deafened by the sound of how FRIGGING INCREDIBLE THIS PLACE IS.    Ok, maybe a little over the top, but it is well-deserved.    Everyone from my office strolled down here one day, figuring we might as well try a new local business.  The service was on the spot.  Your butt hits the chair and the cornbread gets slapped down in front of you.  You look at it... its a pancake.  You think, \"ok, sure, I'll eat this while I wait.\"  Then, this corn goodness just explodes in your mouth.  Seriously, I could eat just the cornbread.    The first time I ate there, I had the Oxtail.  Then, that's what I had the next three times too, because it was sooooo good.  But, I figured that I should at least explore the menu a bit.  The chicken and waffles just might have to be on my short list if I am ever offered a \"last meal.\"  The breading here is like nothing I have ever tasted before.  The liver and onions?  FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT LIVER AND ONIONS!  They are a spiritual experience.  Turkey leg!  Howl at the freakin moon and call me sally!  Whatever that means....   I have yet to eat anything here that didn't make me crave it the next day.  I HATE this place, as it has caused me to put 5 lbs on in the past month eating here.  I CANT STOP!    Yeah, its THAT good.    And, the food isn't the only great thing.  The people who work here are so nice, great service.    I guess if I had to say anything is not 100%, maybe the atmosphere?  But, that's only if you are looking for \"atmosphere.\"  It is utilitarian.  Nothing fancy.  Frankly, I am glad for that.  It does not NEED any accoutrements, or padded booths, or anything else.   This is the kind of place that keeps you coming again and again with great food and great service.  I love, love, love this place.  Best thing to happen to the neighborhood!",

    "text": "Just moved to the area not too long ago and my roommate goes here all the time. He recommended it a while back, so I decided to do take-out for dinner tonight. When I got there, I was helped out right away and was told my order would only take a few minutes, and it did! Wait time, food and the amount of options that sounded tasty was great. Yet, one thing held me back from a better rating.  Originally, I asked for BBQ ribs, but, was told they were out. Luckily, they had short ribs in replacement that the cashier had filled me in on. Further, my roommate recommended trying the fried okra for a side and I was really excited to try it. Out of the three sides that came with my meal, it was the first I chose! The cashier even yelled out, \"fried okra,\" to the chefs, I'm assuming to inform them to get it started. Although I got my food fast, when I got home to eat, the fried okra wasn't on the plate. If it was unavailable like the BBQ ribs that I had originally asked for, I would have appreciated being able to choose another option like what had occurred before, not shorted on my meal.   Overall, I am going to come back and try the fried chicken, but, am disappointed, the one and only thing I knew I wanted to get before walking in was forgotten. Really bummed me out and made me want to call, but it is a bit of a hassle to have to drive back just for a side. If management is reading this review, is there anyone I can contact for compensation on my next visit? It was paid for. Feel free to respond with information if so. Thank you!",

The service for our dinner was great, the food tasted like I remember from my childhood in  - spicy but tender greens, pan fried cornbread, and the hot links were spot on. Even better, actually - they made the bread like Texas toast.  Why didn't we think of that in Springfield (:  I'm going back and trying their breakfast - been a long time since I had grits.  The only thing - and it is good I suppose - I had hoped for greasy fried chicken and theirs is more healthy.  Would be nice to add some \"heart attack\" to the menu like they do downtown?  Anyway, I live nearby and will definitely  be a regular.",

    "text": "Finally some southern food on this side of town! M&M was my go-to place for soul food but its actually too far from me. This place is a good substitution. Like the other people have said, the meat loaf is the thing to order here. One bite of this and you'll be transported to fluffy meat loaf smothered gravy heaven! (does it exist? YES!) Thing to stay away from were the ribs. I think there were only 3-4 ribs and they were covered in so much sauce it made it difficult to eat. The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price. This is geared towards the ribs and the meat loaf. Even though they do come with sides, the main reason why I ordered the entree was to get the entree.... and not the sides.... so I expect a larger portion. Other than that, this is a good place for some good southern food.",

When I had the first bite of the oxtail, the sky broke open, I was immediately bathed in sunshine, and a choir of angels began to sing. I told them to eff off because I was busy eating.  It's soooo good. Peppery, slightly spicy, and tender, all at once. A single tear is rolling down my cheek remembering the experience.  Oh, and the greens and mac were pretty good too.

Sat down and took a look at menu quickly realized prices seemed expensive for the type of establishment but being the foodies we are we ordered regardless to try a new place and hopefully somewhere new to go for soul food. Order grilled chicken, yams , green beans, and my other half ordered turkey leg & gravy, red beans and rice , cabbage. The waitress quickly brought us cornbread which  I loved! The lemonade and kool  aid drink was surprisingly yummy. Our food came and I was quickly unimpressed the grill chicken tasted odd I couldn't figure it out my green beans were definitely  canned, although the yams were yummy. I wondered as well if they were canned . The turkey leg the other half ordered was awful and flavorless he said it had apparently been boiled  I guess.. yikes he mentioned the same about the green beans being canned tasting, and forget about the cabbage it looked awful like it had been boiled and reheated for a week absolutely gross looking he wouldn't touch it. This is coming from a man that never complains about food! We were extremely disappointed by the meal as a whole! The service was great and waitress was friendly but the food was lacking True soul food taste, flavor and freshness!  Unfortunately we won't be going back.",

Maybe the chef was having an off day when I 1st tried it... happens.  Thank you to Shila for the invite to come back, my husband and I were truly happy with our yummy lunch!!!!  My smothered steak was delicious as was the chicken fried rice.  If you like soul food you should make this a stop!!!",

When I was there the 2 sets of White patrons received premium service. Their soda was promptly refilled. They were repeatedly asked if everything was okay. For both White patrons, the service fee charged for using your debit or credit card was waived. They didn't ask for it to be waived, it was told to them by the heavy set Black waitress that she was doing this for them. How sweet. When I asked if the fee could be waived for me and my husband's meal, I was told no.   The Black patrons had to ask for their sodas to be refilled and was constantly trying to get their servers attention. It was awful. The food was okay but this display of service will keep me away. I will go to Lo-Lo's, which is a hike. I live 10 mins from Soul Food Cafe.   I hope they understand every patron, regardless of color, deserves premium service.",

It is conveniently located in the South West area. Their prices are decent for their serving size. Of course I had to get the chicken and waffles. Every meal comes with corn bread. And when I was thinking they would be small, they're actually pretty big, warm, and delicious! Unlike what you would expect. Their waffles are thin and good sized. But doesn't compare to Roscoe's crispy nature. Their wings are good as well if you don't mind getting down and dirty. What makes the taste even better is the hot sauce that they provide. I got the Mac and cheese as a side and it is very cheesy and smooth. Service is good, nothing to complain about. They're really nice and always greet you when you come in. Usually if it's not busy they let you sit yourself. I always catch myself tipping them nicely.  I'm glad I tried it out because now I don't have to drive 4 hours to get some chicken and waffles. They have a bunch of other selections that I haven't tried yet. But it truly is yummy comfort food that captures your soul.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch today and here is my impression:  Decor: Was very basic but homey with your typical walls filled will VIP photos. Got a bit loud due to small space, talkative lunch crowd and radio blarring.   Service: Waitresses greeted me with kindness and got me seated quickly with a drink. They give you a hotcake shortly after you sit, which is frisbee cold by the time you get your food. So eat that straight away. I ordered fried chicken with fried okra and cabbage. Waited 25 minutes for my order. I didn't mind because the meat was made to order and not sitting under a sun lamp. But, unless you have more than an hour for lunch and/or it's not busy then beware as you will find yourself rushing to eat. The kitchen seemed to have a hard time servicing larger tables while keeping the small tables in line.   Food Quality:  Had the dark meat (leg and thigh), which was just the right temperature and crispiness. The thigh was small and a little overcooked but the chicken was overall a 7 out of 10. The fried okra was delicious. A tad bit too salty for a perfect rating but highly recommended. The cabbage was average. Seasoning was bland and leaves were limp from either overcooking or sitting in the juice too long. I prefer them kinda firm. Overall side dishes were also 7 outta 10 with the okra giving the average cabbage a needed boost.   Value: Dark meet fried chicken lunch plate and large glass of lemonade (not homemade) came to $14.59 with tax. So, I would say the value was slightly below average but on par with competition (M&M). The price point was slightly aggressive but not offensive.  Recommend?:  Yes, if you are in the area. I live a mile away from this place and still make a longer trip to M&M when I want slightly better food with a tad bit more \"soul.\"",

Let's break it down.  3 piece **DARK** chicken $16: DARK Chicken that would turn you into a prune, it had so much salt. Just salt. No seasoning and ridiculously dry. If someone gave me this in one hand and a dog treat in the other, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Mac n cheese: Elbow macaroni. Tasteless Cheese.  Rice n gravy: White rice. Gravy from a can. Fried okra: OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! WOAH GOOD! No words, just so good I couldn't stop eating them. Small portion though. Hot link sandwich: $8.99 Burned link with BBQ sauce (?) on two pieces of toast, soaked in butter on just one side, other side was completely white. Came with french fries doused in salt. SO SO much salt. Peach cobbler: $4.25 (!!!!) for a small styrofoam cup those sundaes from Jewel-Osco come in. Not good at all. Tasted like simple syrup and very flour-y pie crust. Lots of liquid in the cup, thats not normal.  I love salt. I use it on everything, but this was so much. Inedible. I ordered through bite squad, who are usually on their game. Unfortunately, SFC was not. When I realized the peach cobbler we ordered was not in our bag, I called the restaurant and asked if I could have it. She said \"it's not here, but you can come get it if you want.\" Wait, what? If it's not there, why would I drive all the way to Rainbow? That's the whole point in DELIVERY. Also, why would I have to come get it?  A better suggestion than this place would be every other restaurant in Vegas. Waste of money, I'd rather raise my blood pressure elsewhere.",

Highly overpriced for mediocre food with small proportions. All the sides weren't even available. I asked for potato salad, there was none... I asked for red beans and rice... there was none... I asked for hush puppies, there was none. How don't you have all your listed side dishes on a Sunday during peak hours?? The sweet tea had a funny taste to it. I couldn't even finish my glass. I asked for a water instead. The greens were extremely salty and tasted like they were straight from the can. My catfish could have stayed in the fryer another minute or two, and on a \"cheesy\" scale, the Mac and cheese was a 4 of 10 tops. When going to a soul food restaurant you expect nothing less than greatness. My granny would have went back in their kitchen and schooled the cook on how to prepare \"soul food\" no pun intended. Doubt I'll ever be back unless I'm invited and includes me not paying.",

I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul Food Cafe a try! We were greeted by a very nice waitress and seated right away on a Sunday, so far so good! I ordered the Catfish lunch, comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the meal) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered Fried Chicken rice and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids menu, but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked chicken for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of food so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after waiting about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and waitress said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our food, honestly the portion size was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the food was pretty tasty but for the price/portion ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back?   btw..we ordered the Sugar Momma : Sweet Tea/ Lemonade and the Sugar Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet...drank all my sugar for the month ;) lol",

Fish was cooked nice and crisp. It was great with a little tartar sauce and their home made hotsauce. Loved the fried Okra.... tore that up. The rice and gravy was simple, but very good as well. I wasn't used to having corn bread in a mini pancake form, but it also tasted good. Nothing too special with the corn bread. I've had better corn bread with actual corn in it. Overall, I really liked the place. Friendly waitress, sports on the tv and not loud at all. I will have to try the rest of the menu when I am back in Vegas again.",

We indulged in the fried chicken, meatloaf,  mac-n-cheese, red beans and rice, corn bread, and potato salad.  Wow...just wow!  Everything was delicious and brought back fond memories of good ole' southern cooking, since we're originally from the south.  Miss LaShonda took our order and was very helpful explaining all of the plentiful meal options to choose from to complete our dinner selection. The restaurant was very clean and smelled delightful. The only thing we noticed were the prices to be a little high but you are getting some freshly prepared and delicious soul food! The peach cobbler was added for dessert and we could barely stop ourselves from eating it entirely at one sitting!  We highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to visiting them again!",

The environment is cozy and inviting, and the prices are very reasonable.

I had the Chicken and Waffle with sides of cornbread and greens.  The  Cornbread was fantastic. Served pancake-style with butter. I could have eaten my weight in these.   The Waffle was light and fluffy, The Chicken was nicely fried. I upgraded to the 'breast' option, and it was worth it.   The Greens - now here it gets tricky. Having spent a good deal of time in the South, I am used to the fact that the Soul Food there tends to be salty for my taste. This was the only part of my meal that I thought was just too salty for this Northern boy's taste buds. It was still good, but I was glad that there was a friendly refill on beverages.  The dinner prices were on the high end for what the meal was. I don't generally expect to pay $20 for a basic meal in a strip-mall type establishment. But I will definitely be back for the food and for the friendly environment. My hope is that we can get the salt toned down - letting the customers add as much (or as little) as they like.   Very Nicely Done.",

The chicken & waffles are amazing here. And I can say that because I moved here from LA where I frequented Roscoe's (arguably the most popular C&W spot on the map) on the regular. I think they have this special recipe for their waffles that was killing me it was so good.   I think they gave a fair portion of butter on top but my arteries were feeling dangerous so I asked for more and our waitress was super cool about it. Didn't even try to upcharge me like other petty places would.  I will say my favorite thing about this place was that it was comfortable. It felt like eating at home. They had very casual hip-hop playing without any corporate sensorship, the servers were friendly in a very relaxed way, and weren't even that upset that we were those horrible people who came in around closing time. They just worked around us without rushing at all. It was pretty cool. It felt like you were casually eating at home, and that was refreshing to find a place like that. The only difference is no one I've EVER lived with cooks that good (don't tell mom).",

I truly enjoy delivery their food as customers absolutely love this restaurant. But as a courier, I experienced 30+ minute wait times, never received even a hello upon coming in, and very little customer service (I get it, I'm not the customer but more so a middle man. I'm used to it). I would deal with it because the customer is always excited to receive the food even if it's been a long wait.   My last visit however, speaks for how this restaurant should always be. The manager Sheila was there and she was the one to assist me. She is what customer service is! Upon arrival, order was ready. 4 entrees, a bunch of sides, and 3 drinks (I expected a 40 minute wait). After already being reassured by another employee there that the order was correct, Sheila stepped in and went through every item with me. We found a few discrepancies but she had the correct items out before I could even take a breath. She knows what customer service is and understands that although I'm a courier, there's a customer on the otherside. THANK YOU!! Not only did you make a group of customers very happy with your speed and attentiveness, but you've gained a new customer.",

The answer to the first question is \"nothing\" and the answer to the second is \"just about anywhere else.\"  TL:DR - Save 60% and go to Church's for a better dinner.  Ordered fried chicken and a bunch of extra sides to try. Here's the breakdown:  Fried chicken - single coating, over-salted, semi crunchy, dark meat OK, white meat destroyed through overcooking.  Corn - fresh out of the can, hardly even drained.  Okra - same as the chicken, except somehow even saltier.  Hush puppies - dry.  Mac and cheese - probably the best side here, done right.  Fries - awful. Limp, soggy, and yet cooked so dark they look like burnt sweet potato fries.  Potato salad - did they buy it from Albertsons next door?  Peach cobbler - undercooked and swimming in juice.  Very disappointing. Don't go.",

I ordered the fried catfish dinner via Postmates delivery which was to include 3 sides and cornbread for just shy of $20 before tax. Unfortunately, I didn't receive the cornbread. The catfish was tasty and a hearty portion. The sides, however, were pretty small. The fried okra was a good size and tasted fine. The Mac n cheese was ok. The rice and gravy tasted pretty good but that was tiny...like less than a quarter cup. Not a huge deal as part of a meal but if you order the sides separately they are over $4 and if I received that size portion for that price I'd be pretty mad.  Anyway, I was really itching for soul food so this scratched the itch and I'm willing to try it again on-site, but so far I'm a little less than impressed. When I think of soul food, I think hearty, comforting, does-your-soul good kind of food. This fell a little short. Will happily update if I try it again.",

I told him about the janky portions but he wanted to try. & per usual, I was right. He ordered a catfish combo. He got 4 catfish strips & the fries tasted like straight grease. The catfish was cut in half length-wise just like the hotlink was. Maybe the description should say catfish strips. This place is over-priced and the portions are terrible.",

I wasn't a fan of the corn, he did like both sides and thought the pork chop was still tender, I agreed.  I had the fried catfish which I did enjoy. My mac and cheese was really good and the yams were not overly sweet or over cooked, A+ on my sides.  I ordered the sweet tea, which I thought was good and didn't taste artificial and myno husband had the sugar daddy which is lemonade and cool-aid. The sugar daddy is a delicious sugar rush.  Although we did enjoy the food, the reason for the 3 stars is more based on ambiance than the food. It's not as if it's a place that we would become regulars at and always drive out for. The service was good, the girl was very nice and managed to get some greens out before we left (my husband wanted that as his side and they didn't have them when we ordered). Sure, it was good but the ambiance is lacking.  It's a decent place for soul food.",

    "text": "Never really had soul food like this before. I originally wanted chicken and waffles with 3 wings and 1 waffle. The menu clearly states that the chicken and waffles that is 1 breast and 1 waffle doesn't come with any sides but apparently the menu was wrong and they don't offer any sides with it at all. So I ended up just getting the lunch portion of fried chicken that comes with 2 sides. I got Mac and cheese and rice and gravy as my sides.   - Cornbread was really good (5/5) - Chicken was on the dry side (3/5) - Mac and cheese was okay (3/5) - Rice and gravy was okay (3/5)  Overall this place is decent. Their portions are pretty generous but I probably would only come back for the cornbread. On another note, they charge you $1.65 if you're paying with a card so I suggest you bring cash here.",

Didnt enjoy any of my meal ultimately paid a 80 tab for some very bad service and horrible food. Wait staff forgot my daughters order then gave it to her as we were gonna leave and still charged us.",

(I noticed after eating most of it and had a stomach ache later. Headache the next day). Someone should honestly let the cook know that styrofoam is TOXIC and consuming it can lead to health problems. The fact that the container was doubled up, tells me that the cook knew the oil created holes on the bottom of the styrofoam. Health concern is a deal breaker. Won't be eating here again or recommending it. Hope they do something about that.",

I was there on a Sunday afternoon and the service was fast and friendly.  Liver and Onions cooked perfectly and the gravy was excellent. The Fried Okra had really good seasoning,  I've had some bland ones from other places,  I could eat these all day. The Mac and Cheese had great flavor,  I wish that portion size had been larger.  Will definitely be eating here again and highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Firsr off, let me say the food is good. No complaints there. My complaints are about service, attitude and pricing. The more popular this company gets, the smaller the portion becomes, but im still paying over 15 bucks a meal. People who take your oder seem to act like you are bothering them instead of happy you are over paying for the food. I used to eat here all the time. My last 4 to go visits, I have been missing anywhere from 1-3 itema each time. It happened again today at breakfast. Get all the home and see im missing a waffle and my grits. I found this ridiculous since the rude lady asked the cook specifically for grits, then she hands me my bag that doesn't have them in it. Which I find out once I got home. Im soooo tired of it, I didn't even call in and complain this time. For what? The fake apology and just to have my next order missing things as well. Sad part is I was the only order they were working on, how do you mess it up?  The wait timea are always longer than what you are told, no matter how empty or full the restaurant is. I hope they get their act back together. I won't be in for a long while, but if I try again, would like 1) to not have someone act like im bothering them when calling in my order 2) a decent portion size  3) to be ready on time 4) and finally, to actually have \"all\" of what I ordered.",

I live very close to soul food cafe, don't even have to go through a cross light to get home. I pay for my food, leave, go home and open the food. Somehow, even though I ordered and waited 20 minutes, my food is lukewarm. The fried okra is barely warm. The so called hot and fresh peach cobbler which was 6.50 is smooshed in this tiny container and is ICE COLD!!!   My sides besides the okra was the Mac and cheese which tastes okay, the hush puppies are decent, my catfish tastes good and my mom seems to be enjoying her chicken and waffles.   A lady who was very nice came up to me with a card to vote Soul Food Cafe for best in Las Vegas soul food while I waited, which I did. I wish I hadn't. Flavor wise, they are way better in my opinion than nasty M&M soul food on charleston, but they are marked down two full stars for not giving me hot food. And the little side of hot sauce for a dinner sized portion of catfish is just wrong. The cold peach cobbler is just embarrassing. I just don't understand, I watched them start the food, I can't process how it all got so cold in just a few minutes.   I'm eating because I'm hungry, okra is going in the toaster oven while I eat the rest  $35.00 total.   I probably will not return.",

This time our kids got sweet tea, which is good according to them, but we found out this time that they aren't giving free refills on it. But our sodas were unlimited. Our bill for one order of pancakes, a plate of vegetables, and a meat and two veggies plate was 57.00. The worst part was nearly $20 of hat was drinks because they charge $2.89 every time you get a tea refill. While the food is good it seems that the price is not worth it. Not to mention with time we had Charlie (sp?), she was not very nice and it was not a pleasant experience. We probably won't go back.",

I have changed the review to 3 stars to represent that. There were still times where it was good, but never as good as first couple visits.   You get that southern feel from this restaurant and personally I LOVE it! Fantastic service but if you order chicken it does take a while to get but it's well worth the wait as they FRESH MAKE everything! For anyone complaining about wait time doesn't know what soul food is about.   The fried chicken is the best I have had since Kathy's was doing it right in the SE part of town. This is one of the best soul food restaurants in town and I am excited to have good soul food so close to home.",

The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the flavor.  Instead i got an overcooked dry and inedible breast.  I was starving so i forced myself to eat it by washing it down with lots of hot sauce.  I ordered the chicken dinner with 2 sides, collards and cabbage which were both good.  The cornbread pancake amuse was a nice starter as i waited 15 minutes for the chicken.  I certainly dont mind the wait but dont serve me a well done piece of chicken when i can pay a fraction and get better fried chicken at popeye's or churches.  i wont be back - yes it s possible they missed but you cant miss on fried chicken when that's one of your staples....it should be easy...like a layup for them...come on man!",

I went in not with high hopes and to my amazement I was right the food was horrid.   I decided to try the smothered steak with 2 sides(Mac+cheese bland)... This was one of the worst decisions of my life. The steak was in pieces and swimming in gravy making it look like I ordered soup with a side of beef jerky. The texture of the meat seemed nothing near fresh, it tasted as of it were made a week in advanced and consistently frozen and defrosted everyday for preparation on the days menu. I would never slam anyone's cooking like this but it seriously had the consistency of a schools lunch food prepared by microwave. Not palatable to any extent. The only thing that did bring me some enjoyment was the delectable corn bread pancake. I don't think I could bare to give this place another shot.",

I'm sorry to say that, but truthfully Portland has been the only place to wow me in the West, something I'm sad to admit. Anyway, I went in for the first time today with an open mind, mainly because I was hungry and I didn't want to be disappointed.   I ordered the short ribs (w/ barbecue sauce) dinner with cabbage, macaroni and cheese, and hush puppies, with banana pudding for dessert. All this came to a total of $28 and some change... a bit pricey if you ask me, especially considering the ingredients are probably not that great (i.e., organic, non-gmo, or locally-grown). The food came hot and quick, but the serving sizes left something to be desired. Ordered to-go, the food comes in a larger styrofoam to-go box with a foil-wrapped cornbread pancake... this was the highlight of the meal. Otherwise, the short ribs were seasoned well, but very fatty and the sides were lackluster. As a second-runner up, the cabbage was satisfying.   I would not have taken the time to write a review, except the banana pudding pissed me off. For $4.25, I got like a little cup of banana pudding, but it was the worse I've ever had. The pudding was from the box, you know that horrid yellow/gold color and terrible after taste. Needless to say, I was disappointed... cara triste.",

I recommend this place if you're in a mood for real southern meals. The pics beyond the first two are my own... I just took everything and placed it on plate and added hot sauce and ranch (because that's how I like my catfish). The meals are more than enough to get you full and you'll be satisfied the only thing I would suggest is cutting back on the sodium with the fried meals because you definitely taste the salt. But everything is made fresh to order and it will have you wanting to come back for seconds",

The woman that I believe is one of the owners greeted us right away and made us feel welcome. We browsed the menu a bit and shortly after she took our orders. I was a little concerned that the menu says 25 minutes minimum for fried foods, but I don't think our orders took that long.  I opted for Fried Chicken with Yams and Greens and a glass of Sweet (swaaaaate) Tea. The sweet tea tasted like it was made with cane sugar which I really enjoyed. The Fried Chicken was heavenly. It was tender inside with a light, flavorful coating on the outside that wasn't greasy in the least. The yams were buttery and greens were tender with a little kick of heat. I absolutely loved the cornbread pancake that is served alongside the meal. It was a perfectly prepared pancake with a very unique flavor.  My husband had the Fried Catfish and was a happy man. He loved the catfish. Like the fried chicken, the catfish had a light breading that packed flavor, but was not heavy or greasy. His Hushpuppies and Red Beans & Rice were both awesome sides.  The restaurant decor is minimal, mostly just photos of celebrities that have visited the restaurant. Pricing was fair for the portions and great soul food. We'll definitely be back.",

If you dont wanna make it then take it off the menu.  Also on of the front counter women is not necessarily rude but very just sort of unwelcoming.  Made me not really want to eat there.  I'm looking at the menu trying to tell her what I want (oxtails) and she just turns around the other way to do something else and rudely say \"we outta oxtails for the day\". No \"sorry about that would you like to try something else.\"  Just didnt give a damn.  Being black, I'm disappointed that it's always like this at black owned places there either lazy and or rude.  I dont ever write reviews on restaurants I dont take it that seriously but I had to finally get this out about this place.",

I am not sure what others are saying about serving size, but my thigh and breast were huge and cooked perfectly. I got smothered Chicken with the smother on the side. No smother showed up. Still outstanding fried chicken. -Fried Catfish 4/5. Catfish itself was 5/5 but it came with packaged tarter sauce. Put some effort in on the tarter sauce please. One of your best dishes would be enhanced by it. -Collard Greens- 4/5. A little more bite than one would assume but still very good. -Rice and Gravy, Mac and Cheese, Hushpuppies, Peach Cobbler, Cornbread Pancake. 3/5. All of these were ok but nothing stood out as really good. I think the Cornbread Pancake could have been if it were hot and had some butter. -Service 4/5. Giving 3 to the girl on the phone and 5 to the delivery guy, he was great.  -Delivery 3/5. If you know before you call that they are either not gong to be able to deliver or it's going to take at least 1.5 to 2 hours you won't be upset. Going into this second attempt I knew 2 things when I called. 1. It was going to take a long time if in fact they could deliver. 2. If I called on a Friday or Saturday night I might as well been calling the President of the United States to deliver me something. It would not happen. If you keep these 2 rules in mind you won't be disappointed. Delivery guy was super nice and the food was as hot as if I was sitting at a table by the kitchen. Oh, and there is a minimum $40 delivery order, with a $5 delivery charge added on, just so you know.  Advice to the business would be to work on your sides and reformulate your delivery structure.",

We ordered our food to go.  We got the chicken and waffles- DUH!- the chicken fried rice, cornbread and Mac and cheese. While we waited, they gave us a free cornbread which at first we thought was a pancake. Very light and airy and buttery and tasty. So far so good. We make it home with our food! I'm starving so I'm thinking this is all gonna be good! First we try the chicken fried rice- so flavorful- yes very similar to the Chinese dish- however- hit the brakes on the salt though! Whoa! I would order it again just to see if it was this batch, because it was good just way too salty! Get me some water? Next we tried the chicken and waffles- again flavorful, thin, crispy fried skin, juicy chicken inside- but also a bit salty. The waffles were nothing to write home about and we weren't impressed by the Smuckers (?) packed syrup- we were really expecting the syrup to have been a little bit more homemade-ish, oh well. Finally, the Mac and cheese...my friend who recommended this place swears by it, I've had better. Also- that free cornbread while we waited? In the end it looks like we did pay for it after all because they forgot to add it in our order. When we do return, I'll definitely look into getting their chicken and cornbread only- and of course, banana pudding.",

So I get on her bike and head out there for a soul food style breakfast.   I ordered the corned beef hash with potatoes and a side of waffles. I totally enjoyed the breakfast. Corned beef hash must have been cooked with butter or something because it was pretty rich compared to other hashes i've had. their waffles tasted pretty good as well.   Although I finished my whole breakfast, it wasn't a meal that totally stuck in my head. I'm sure they've changed a couple things since then, but i'm in no rush to re-try this place.",

I then noticed that one of the cooks  was looking at me giving me a SERIOUSLY Dirty look. I'm thinking what did I do. I approached the counter area and picked up a menu and a girl comes up to me and says \"we stop seating at 8:30\". So this is my \"welcome\" to the place. So much for Southern Hospitality. I mention to her the hours posted say 9:00. \"So you really close at 8:30, not 9\" I asked. She was \"kind\" enough to offer me a dark meat chicken order that had been made by mistake. I'm thinking really!!! I simply told her that I don't like dark meat, turned around and left.  I don't care how good the food might be. When I have a craving for fried cjicken I will go to KFC before I ever give this place a penny. Business must be good if they can turn away customers in such a nasty, inhospitable way.",

At our table we had (entrees) fried chicken, seafood platter , chicken and waffles , smothered pork chops, smothered liver and onions. Our sides were greens, Mac and cheese, corn, green beans, yams, rice and gravy, their oh so perfectly sweeten corn bread was AWESOME .

The food was good but not great like some of the soul food places in LA.  The catfish was well seasoned and tender on the inside , mac and cheese was like the ones you would buy at Smith's or Alberton's but good. lol if you like that kind of mac and cheese .  The price was not worth the quality of the food.  I paid total with tax for the catfish lunch plate $14. bucks with tax no drink.  Sorry to say I probably won;t be coming back here anytime soon.  I was a little disappointed in this place.  I think that the quality of food should reflect the price but it failed to do so. (sad face)",

    "text": "This review isn't for the food(i'm so annoyed i haven't even touched it yet) but for their customer service and their asinine bagger/prep/waitress. After careful consideration of where to order soul food from(because there isn't any in the area I live and a 30-45 min drive is imminent) My mom and I decided to do Soul Food Cafe. I ordered online from grub-hub and spent a good 80 bucks on 3 dinners and a large peach cobbler. After the lovely scenic drive, I entered the store and waited in line to pick up. The cashier? Meh, I've had friendlier people at Walmart at midnight, but whatever, I'm a customer service stickler(since i work in hospitality) and not everyone agrees with my \"big smile and greetings.\" *shrugs* Ok, i tried to give her my ID and announce my pick up, she looks confused and glances at the \"asinine lady\"  who says, \"oh, you already paid? yeah your bags are over there- on the counter beside them.\"You can just grab it and go.\" Ummm..ok? Most places at least hand it to me but ok, cool, maybe she had back surgery and can't lift. *shrugs again*  Fast Forward, I'm home and checking the bags. Hmmm..No peach cobbler. UGH don't wanna drive back, but called anyway and advised of the issue. It's no harm no foul, so I called very pleasantly because \"S**T happens\".  Cashier answers, and then places me on hold(didn't ask or say she was, just...silence.\" and then another voice comes on the line and tells me that she \"specifically packed the bag herself and the cobbler is in there.\" OK...i'm not Stevie Wonder, but I don't see it.  \"I packed it! but whatever, i can give you another one.\"   Ummm..another one? ma'am I don't have the FIRST one i ordered!  She then proceeds to tell me a credit can be added to a future order or i can come get it. At this point, since she pretty much thinks i'm lying, I decided to come and get it and never deal with a company who is this dang petty.   SO here we go..another scenic drive back(it's dark by this time and I'm hungry). I stand around to be acknowledged by her and she then starts to pack the cobbler. She STILL wants to argue with me and tell me it was in the bag and how she packed it! Are you serious?! Ma'am, I'm gainfully employed  and  i can purchase all of your cobbler if wanted and this drive from Summerlin has been more expensive than the cobbler you \"think\" i'm stealing from your paycheck! After 40 minutes, from when i last stepped foot in here,  you still want to argue about how you're perfect and don't make mistakes huh? Ok...your 1st customer service mistake is to never assume anything. Unless you're IRobot I'm sure you can make mistakes and simply \"FORGET!\" Take Kendrick's advice and  BE HUMBLE!. 2nd, we don't call guests liars( inadvertently or flat out) 3rd, you should actually use empathy and perhaps apologize(i know where i work, i apologize constantly for things i didn't do..you'll be surprised by how some people just want to be heard) And I actually still said \"thank you\"(my mother raised me with manners, i can't help it) even after she attempted to belittle me. (Ms Asinine, never replied back and actually said things that she knew i couldn't hear due to the loud dinner atmosphere).   It's all good, you live and learn..and with that knowledge you know where to order from and where to do business.    Dear Manager-run back your cameras for the day and see if the cobbler was indeed placed in the bag..and if so, lets find out where it went! Because it sure didn't come to my home.  Sincerely,  A lost customer.",

    "text": "Ugh...I just don't see it!!!  WHAT \"REAL\" SOUTHERN FEEL IS EVERYONE SAYING THEY GET FROM STEPPING INTO THIS PLACE?!?!   My husband and I just left this place highly disappointed! So my husband who was hyped about this place (because some other people hyped him about this place) so we decided to give it a try since it wasn't too far.  It's tucked away off to the W. Warm Springs side of Alberton's...walking in I instantly did not like it. INSTANTLY. It is a small establishment so the minute we walked in we had to walk around a large group that was seated right in front of the door...who does that? I can barely hear any of the ladies greeting us and my husband sure as hell didn't hear them tell us we can sit anywhere we'd like because we stood in front of the register like dummies. Well hello to y'all too!    When we finally figured out we could seat ourselves one of the ladies came over and handed us the menu...she was bleh as a server so whatever. But enough but about her. We opened the menu and I know my husband was thrown off by the PRICES!!! His statement, \"Soooo...this place is more expensive than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. It better blow my fucking mind!\"   We wanted to use the Yelp check-in offer for 50% off of a 2nd dinner when you buy a dinner. So we chose something off of the \"Dinner\" section of the menu. We ordered 2 fountain drinks at $2.89 each! (Fucking expensive for a fountain drink that comes filled with nothing but ice even if the damn refills are free)...2 orders of chicken and waffles priced at $11.25 each, which we thought was a fair price for \"dinner\".  We were first served the cornbread cake...which was good but nothing special...you can get this (same flavor and all) from any soul food restaurant. Then the OWNER brings me my food which I thought was nice. So I got 3 pieces of chicken on one large plate with swirls of grease decorating the plate here and there and a separate plate for the waffle and syrup.   I. Was. NOT. Impressed.   The presentation of the food didn't even look appetizing and the portions are ridiculously small!!! I sucked it up and didn't want to complain to my husband since he was so hyped about this place. He gets his 3 pieces of chicken on a large plate and we wait for his waffle. I'm not a rude-ass and would never eat if the rest of my party hadn't gotten their food...so we BOTH wait. It took them a few minutes to realize we weren't eating and why we weren't eating and finally one of the waitresses saw and went back to grab his waffle. Thanks.   I nibbled on the chicken first and realized it tasted exactly like the seasoning that come in the Wai Wai MaMa noodles packages I get from the Asian store. Smh. It was ok...I was just expecting so much more. The waffle was toooooo soft. It just wasn't right. It wasn't a waffle. But the syrup for the waffle was tastey so it kinda made up for the texture of the waffle.   So we finish eating and get the bill...it came out to $30.57. I asked if we can use the Yelp offer for the dinner...they said NO...\"because we didn't order dinner.\" Well that's mighty strange, given that the meal we ordered was listed under the \"Dinner\" section in the menu.   I didn't want to cause a scene...we just decided to never return...and I mean never...not even for a second chance. Hubs didn't want to leave a tip...but I asked him to leave an $8 for the server that helped us the 2nd time around at least...She was very attentive and polite. So that one star is for her and only her.  Here's the breakdown: Southern Ambience: 0 Food presentation: 0 Flavor: 2 (and that's for the cornbread cake) Food Portion: -2  Cost: -2 Southern Hospitality: 1 (for the 2nd waitress) Crowd: -10 For that rude-ass lady cackling next to us. (But the restaurant has nothing to do with that)  All around score: JUST GO SOME PLACE ELSE.   ***SIDE NOTE: No Roscoe's out here but Hash House A Go Go has a great chicken and waffle plate...yes it's expensive also...no it's not a soul food restaurant... but at least the portions are GINORMOUS, FLAVORFUL and worth every single penny.***  PS...I wonder if the owner has someone else review and edit her responses before posting them to Yelpers...these responses that I have read so far come across very rude, entitled and always unapologetic... you should work on that and all the above...just my opinion.",

Whatever you choose on the menu be sure to wash it down with a diabetically sweet glass of Kool Aid (\"red\" flavor of course!).",

    "text": "The food is pretty good, especially the catfish, but the decor and customer service leaves a lot to be desired, plus the prices are a bit much. If you visit, get it to-go.  *Edit: Let me explain more fully. I first went to Soul Food Cafe two months ago. It was busy & I ordered fried catfish. The owner was working the register & she told me 20 minutes. I walked around the area while I waited & gave them an extra 10 minutes.  When I came back, my food wasn't ready. The owner told me the food would be right out. 45 minutes AFTER that, I was visibly annoyed because multiple customers came in after me and received their order before me. My food finally came & the owner gave me a complimentary dessert & $15 gift certificate for my next visit (meals are over $15, but whatever).  Cue my next visit. I ordered through the Eat24 app this time for pick up. It said 20 minutes. I arrived 30 minutes later and my food STILL wasn't ready. The server at the register was abrasive & the cooks were glaring at everyone in the restaurant.   I have NEVER had a good experience here & I will not return. However, the food is decent if you're really craving it. Just go at your own risk.",

Easy to find and glad it wasn't super busy....at least when I came in.  Was trying to figure out what I wanted, but the owner suggested chicken and waffles. While waiting for food, they gave me some corn bread that looked like a pancake. Initially, it threw me off, but then I realized what it was. A pinch sweeter than I like, but very good. I liked that the waffle wasn't super thick. It looked like it was actually made from scratch and I detected some spices. Not too heavy and good. The chicken breast I received was boneless and had some good seasoning on it.  Had a drink called \"Big Daddy\" which was lemonade and kool aid. It wouldn't last long in my house. Really good. The food was good and it is a spot I will try again when in town. The owner and the staff were really nice and helpful. I think I was tired from my long drive and realized I over tipped....oh well.",

So obviously when I hear that, I gotta check this restaurant out! Well.... had the best foods that were recommended on Yelp and  failed. They were just kinda mew.... however the cornbread pancake thing was good. Other than that took two bits of my food and then decided to no longer eat anymore. It was just super oily and well not good. I don't mind the deep fried/oil goodness where I may or may not get a heart attack, (if it's worth it) but if I had to choose to eat here out of 10 random restaurants... I'd choose this as the last choice. Sorry... just wasn't a fan.",

Clearly you people out here in Vegas don't know good soul food!! I went on heir direct website to place my order. On their site it says FREE DELIVERY WITH PURCHASE OF $25 or more. Imagine my surprise when I click to place order and I am redirected to grubhub. That's also fine until I notice a delivery charge. Hmm that should t be though my order was $58  So imagine my confusion. Yet and still I was so hungry I placed the order. I ordered 2 small sugar daddy drinks. Both $3.00 comes up to a total of $11 and some change and doesn't show or explain how $6 turns into $11. Yet and still I ordered. I ordered 3 wings Mac & cheese and yams. I also ordered chicken breast with Mac & cheese and rice with beans. In the special directions space. I requested that my chicken wings be cut in half. I receive my order and oh boy just bad. The chicken wings were decent. Nothing to brag about NO they were not cut in half as I had requested. The Mac & cheese was salty to bloodclot! Am the yams were just ok, also nothing to brag about. The Cornbread! Oh lord the Cornbread or whatever that was looked like a pancake and did not taste like Cornbread at all!! Not even the texture was like Cornbread. My 3 wings ended up being 2 wings and a weird piece of some kind of meat. Couldn't tell what it was. My chicken breast meal was not chicken breast. It was also chicken wings . My sister doesn't eat chicken wings which is why I ordered her chicken breast! All in all the order and service was mediocre. I can assure you that I will never waste my money here EVER Again!! What a shame the reviews and pics make you think otherwise and I don't have another $60 to waste to see if it was a fluke. Even though my coworkers told me after the fact that the food is bad. Smh",

Honestly I'm not a huge fan of soul food but thought id give it a shot. She had the Chicken and waffles and I had the smothered chicken with corn and red beans and rice. To my surprise I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but considering how expensive it is I would rather spend my $17 elsewhere.  The chicken was cooked pretty good but I was dousing it in the side of hot sauce to give it a little flare. My favorite was the red beans and rice.  The girl that took our order was really friendly and they actually got our food out to us quicker than they had originally told us which was a plus. I would go back again only if I'm with someone else that is craving this type of food... I would never choose this place in my own though.",

I've never been to a soul food restaurant that didn't have cornbread dressing as a staple menu item.   It's also overpriced and they are stingy on the portion sizes.  They could give you more than a couple of tablespoons of greens.  Greens are not delicacies, in fact, they are cheap.  Unless they lower the prices on the dinner menu I don't see them staying in business long.  People will just come that first time to check it out and then will not return just like I did.   The lunch menu is priced reasonable but the dinner menu is definitely overpriced.",

From the hot links, fried chicken and meatloaf to all the sides. The service was great as well! Christine was so nice, cheerful and helpful. Not to mention the cornbread pancakes they serve, delicious!! The hot links were cooked to perfection and actually hot and spicy! I highly recommend the Soul Food Cafe if you are looking for great food at reasonable prices and friendly service! I'm not giving 5 stars only because the lemonade/iced tea drink was REALLY too sweet. Really a great experience!",

The peach cobbler was heavenly. It was hot out of the oven with crispy, thin, flaky crust!  I could go on and on.  We are here visiting from Texas.  We have been eating at all the places featured on The Food Network for Las Vegas. Soul Food Cafe should be featured because it was better in food and service than all of the other places we have been. We eat out all the time on vacation and in Texas. We know good food and good service. Soul Food Cafe is tops!!!!!",

And to be honest I've had better.  1.The fried chicken was crispy but the meat was cut to cook faster which made the meat dry. The chicken had no flavor but a bunch on seasoning thrown on the top after it was fried.  2. The greens had no flavor. The black-eyed peas were not cooked all the way and tasted like vinegar. The potato salad was OK but the potatoes were cut too big. The corn bread or I guess corn cakes were burned to a crisp on the bottom. The mac and cheese was just ok. The rice and gravy was sent out cold. The cabbage was soggy and flavorless. The best side item was the yams.  3. I know catfish and I don't believe it was catfish. First the portions were cut so small and then they fried it so hard it was hard to chew. There was no flavor except cornmeal.  4. The pork chops were crispy but dry and again had no flavor.  5. The hotlinks had a good flavor but was burnt on the outside and cold in the middle.  To be honest the menu is way overpriced for the amount of food that you get. The restaurant was so hot we couldn't even enjoy the food. Also the music was so loud  we had to talk over it and the waitress had to yell.",

Okay, when I tried to order they were out of Oxtails, short ribs, turkey wings and it was only 2:30.

    "text": "So at the last second decided change up my lunch was going for local food. I remember there was Soul Food Cafe in the same shopping mall. I always wanted to try Soul Food Cafe plus thinking about my Ironman Chattanooga journey. The food down south especially the smothered pork chops I had while in Atlanta, GA area. Plus Soul Food is always best recovery meal cause it heavy and filling stuff.   My first impression was it reminded me little bit of down south. The fact seeing all the to go containers. Not sure if most people order take out because when I was down south we were one of the few people dining in. Anyway. It just open area with lots of tables. Few television around most of them on some sports game. They have chalkboard on the counter area with the daily specials. So make sure check it out. It was gumbo that day but had my heart set on smothered pork chops.   They only have smothered chicken and steak. =( It was ok. The main thing was craving was the smothered gravy that on top of the protein choose to put it over. The sides have few choices I went with greens and mac and cheese. Cornbread comes with it. The smothered gravy was solid. It not the same as the one had down south. The consistency was nice thick brown gravy. Like. It was slighter darker style. It had nice flavor and went well with the steak. I felt like it was little on the salty side. I would try it again with fried chicken next time see if taste different. The sides the collard greens. Da Bomb. It cooked perfection. So much flavor. The mac and cheese not really fan. It was ok. Not creamy style mac and cheese. Different best way explain it. The cornbread that was Onolicous!!! At first might get scared cause it looks more like pancake then typical cornbread. I was like where the cornbread. LOL. I found different concept it so nice and moist on the inside. It nice warm whole bite since flat then in muffin or normal bread style. I was like dam get me small stack next time be in cornbread bliss. Seriously!!!!   The service was five stars!!!! I believe the owner came out checking few times. The server was on it constantly checking making sure everything was good.   I look forward to trying more of the menu next visit.......",

I got a lunch special and most soul food places give you a sweet tea but there was no drink included. They didn't even fill the plate and have the nerve to charge the same as other soul food places! I got the mac and cheese, cabbage and yams. The yams tasted like they were fresh out of the can and the mac and cheese had this weird flavor. The cabbage was alright but it wasn't enough. And cabbage does not save the whole meal. I also got the banana pudding and peach cobbler and both were bad. The banana pudding tasted like nothing but jell-o instant and the cobbler was greasy. They were $5 each for the tiniest of bowls.   I remember when I came here before there were a lot of people. When I went this time I was the only customer in there. I don't know why businesses have a good thing then mess it up.   I would never return!",

Greens flavorless think they just boiled them in water with no seasoning no smoke meat of any kind YUKYUK  my other sides were about the same  no seasoning no flavour just sub-par not someplace I slend money at agaim",

We had the fried chicken, fried catfish, grilled chicken, and sweet potato pie. The pie was tasty and served in a tiny pie pan. The fried chicken and catfish were both cooked very well. They were crispy and very tasty. The grilled chicken was somewhat unexpected but in a good way. It had a citrus flavoring and it was the first to disappear from our table.  Our waitress was very helpful with the menu and providing suggestions for two guests who do not eat soul food often. Dining in and taking out seems to be a big difference from reading other reviews, so I suggest dining in before taking out.  The only thing negative I have to say is the sweet tea was just awful. I have had many different sweet teas and I do not know what happened. The sweetener, consistency, or I really have no idea made me not want to take more than one sip. I was happy with everything else we ordered.",

Catfish was cooked to perfection, moist, crisp flavorful breading, the okra was the same freshly made which you can tell from the texture.  The greens were tender and nicely seasoned, I also had ribs sweet bbq sauce, mustard potato salad, just like moms, and mac and cheese. Everything was just perfect, thank you for following up Shila.",

Positives: 1) Very friendly 2) Food is good  I had the Fried Chicken dinner with three sides: Yams, Beans & Rice and the Green Beans.  Everything I ate was tasty, so again, the food is not the issue.  The only thing I found to be just \"meh\" was the cornbread that everyone seems to rave about on here...maybe it was because I did take-out and it wasn't completely fresh by the time I got it home, but it was underwhelming.    My g/f got the rib dinner of which I tasted one rib and it was tender and delicious.   Negatives: PRICE  Wayyy too expensive!  $16.99 for the fried chicken dinner.  I'm aware that's not \"expensive.\" I'm not trying to come off as cheap andI know it comes with three sides, but that's just too much money for the portion size.  The chicken was tasty, the pieces were tiny(and I don't eat large meals). Most of the dinners were around $16.99 to $18.99 which might be fine for other items, but not for fried chicken.    I'll concede that I do not remember the prices of their sandwiches and breakfasts, but the dinner was overpriced for what I received.  Maybe if the pieces of chicken were larger I'd have less of an issue, but it's still too much money for fried chicken. for the price of the ribs, we should have received a rack.  I think this pace tries to value their sides a little too much.",

I told her to get them and I ordered the catfish. The fish was so over cooked that it sounded like I was biting into potatoe chips. She said her ribs were OK, but I didn't try them since there were only 3 on her plate. My wife ordered the smothered steak, I gotta say the gravy was great, I loved it, but the steak was over cooked and instead of cooking it in the gravy they pied ur over the top. My fries cane out so burnt that I thought they gave me sweet potatoe ferries instead. I told her I wanted regular fries and she told me they weren't sweet potatoes and she would have then make me fresh ones. Who the hell would bring out fries that represent your establishment like that?       The waitress was nice and friendly and very helpful, she was actually the best part of the experience. It also disappointed me that our sides came out to us about 10 minutes before or meals did, and that I paid $18.50 for 3 pieces of fish and some small sides. It is way overpriced. I paid $8.50 for my son's sandwich that should of been a $2.99 item off of the kids menu. I wish I could say I'd go back but I'd be lying.",

When someone walks in the person at the front should stand up and speak to the customers. It gives a attitude that you could care less if your there or not. This is not saying that she had a attitude but first impressions make the world of difference. Be more involved with your guest, instead of telling them to grab a menu hand it to them people are more likely to stay and come back.

Honestly I'm not a fan of cornbread but it was soooo yummy and different because it was like a pancake!(: I will for sure come by again. I also recommend their chicken and waffles, my boyfriend ordered it and I took a bite of absolute wonderfulness. Haha :) didn't expect the waffles to have cinlnamon which made it 10 times better!!!

Initially I was disappointed that I was told delivery was not available but was quickly told of an alternative to receive delivery from their establishment. The customer service was awesome. Shila assisted me repeatedly to ensure I was satisfied from start to finish to receive my delivery. The food was GREAT. The portions were more than generous. The oxtails fell off the bone, the gravy was delicious and the mac and cheese, potato salad, fried okra, homemade drinks and peach cobbler were all on point!!! I highly recommend this cafe for your soul food fix. Nothing better than great food and great service. My only regret is that I cannot make it down to experience the great service in person. The service and follow up was so amazing by phone that I can only imagine the 5 star in person service to be extended. Shila is a phenom!!! She pays attention to detail. My order was made to perfection and the vendors the cafe work with for delivery represent the cafe with the best of service of well. Give them a try (or two as I will) you will not be disappointed. Thanks again Shila.",

I'd recently read a nice review done by Heidi Knapp-Rinella for the RJ and was excited.  I took my family here tonight and it was just an okay experience.  The hotwater cornbread was the best i've had in a long time.  The hushpuppies, greens, waffles, and fries were great, too.  The chicken was nice and crispy, but like in so many places, the meat wasn't seasoned.  (I usually marinate my chicken overnight in a buttermilk brine prior to frying).  Our server, Patrice, was awesome, very friendly and attentive.  What ruined the experience for me?  I was checking out and when I'd informed the person that I didn't want to use my PIN but wanted to process the order as a credit, I was informed that I would have to pay a 3.5% surcharge.  EXCUSE ME?!! pay for using my own card?  And she had the audacity to reply, \"well, it's not that much, only a few dollars.\"  SERIOUSLY? then why are you trying to pass on this cost to your customers?  For this reason alone, I will NEVER come back here.  What a crappy attitude!",

    "text": "First-timer and was there yesterday, Thursday, 10-15-15, to celebrate a few adult birthdays with a group of guys. I started with the cornbread - delicious! My entree was the catfish, fried in a decent and not too heavy batter, with selected sides of red beans and rice, fried okra - I think using the same batter as the catfish, and collard greens. The greens were the standout side as they were not too vinegary but cut through my fry-heavy meal. My food was good and the catfish even better with a dash of the table-top hot sauce. The red beans were just a little toned down I'm sure to have a broader appeal. The fried okra was just good fried okra, which you will appreciate if you've ever had bad fried okra! I did make a reservation as I knew this place isn't enormous. We were seated by and had drink orders taken by one person, who got us started with the cornbread. A 2nd young lady took our order and made great recommendations for everything. Our party had the smothered steak, meatloaf, chicken and waffles and oxtails, along with my catfish. Other sides were macaroni and cheese, cabbage, hush puppies and I think one guy tried the black-eyed peas. All were good and everything - and I mean everything, was steaming hot when it was served. They did serve our sides first and separately, kind of keeping with the down-home style, and not an issue with me. Our table was against the front glass, so I didn't really investigate the place, but it was comfortable and clean - I would say exceptional for a place that does a lot of frying and serves syrup! Everyone said the really enjoyed their food. My only old-guy negative was that they had on the NFL Thursday night game on the TVs and some more contemporary radio station in the kitchen area which were clashing in an audible way and lessened our ability to converse. Go there, try the food - it's not cheap but it shouldn't be!",

I came in as a \"take out guest\" on my way to work. Granted yes there was one waitress....no problem.  I waited a few minutes to place an order.  There were two guys in the kitchen looking not so busy. I waited about 5-7 munutes....no biggie. She did acknowledge me and said that shed be right with me. Another guy smile and spoke. But i realized 1) i had to make another stop before work and 2) it would probably take a moment to get my food so i left. As I proceed to walk out the door, the bigger guy yelled (from the back of the restaurant) \"no patience\".... Now how professional is that??? I responded: \" huh\"? He said again \" no patience\" and went into his blabber about her being the only person.  Now i understand these things and wasn't  even bothered by not getting serviced. What got me is an employee yelling at a potential guest about not having patience. So it will be a slim chance of me \"trying\" this restaurant (at least while mr no patience is there).  Can you say business etiquette classed?!?",

The chicken n waffles, fried fish, mac n cheese, rice n gravy, fried okra and hush puppies were all pretty decent -nothing to go crazy over.  The candied yams were extremely sweet, green beans tasted/looked like they came out of a can but the worst was the meatloaf.  It was over seasoned with pepper and the texture was so dense, it didn't even taste like meat!!   The wait staff were friendly and polite and hopefully the dishes improve.  I'd like to give it a try again and hope that things improve when and if I go back.",

Oh my goodness I cannot say enough about the Soul Food Cafe! We used a service called Bite Squad (shout out to them too) for our first time trying this place...I said as I placed the order, \"this better be good guys...we get what we pay for\". YES! worth every penny-indeed!!! My baby girl was actually doing a dance her southern grandfather used to do when he ate his mom's soul food cooking! I told her this meal is so good it really does touch the soul. We ordered: Oxtails, Fried Chicken, and Catfish dinners--ALL AWESOME! Oh and the cornbread??? Well, it's just like Grandma's--really it is! Thank You Soul Food Cafe--we will not go anywhere else. You brought our Southern and Oakland roots to Vegas!!!",

He ordered the chicken and waffles ($9) and I ordered the fried chicken with sides of macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn ($14). The ordered was delivered in 45 minutes. The chicken and waffles were good enough to satisfy the craving. The waffles seemed too similar to an Eggo waffle for me to give much praise too. My order of fried chicken as well as the fried chicken topping the waffle lacked any flavor and was overcooked. The skin and batter was a dark brown color and was slightly bitter. The macaroni and hush puppies were mediocre and the corn was straight out of a can. All in all, not terrible, but for the price, I probably will not eat there again.",

    "text": "I was in the parking lot browsing on my app to find a meal and realized that this was right around the corner of the lot so the MIL and I took a chance.   She's not the most adventurous eater, but figured this was different though safe of a choice.   They serve you a cornbread cake while you wait which was yummy. I'm a sucker for those things and probably could make a meal off that and some greens alone.   I decided on the fried chicken lunch with dark meat, greens and red beans and rice. The leg and thigh were seasoned nicely and the crunch was good on the pieces. I absolutely loved the sides. To my taste, the greens were flavored well and I like when it's cooked to tender but the stems still have some give and not cooked to super soft. I could eat more of those greens because texture is everything for me on greens. Beans and rice was also good.   My MIL wanted gravy and biscuits and they juuusstt stopped serving breakfast at 11am and we were closer to noon.They said they can make it for her though. When it came out she had some reservations as it isn't traditional, but once she took a bite she said that it was tasty. Instead of white country gravy, they used brown gravy and added griddled ground beef to it. She said though the biscuits texture was awesome and one of the better biscuits she had and she kinda liked the brown gravy as that's more flavorful that most country gravy.   Service was really friendly. Our server was nice and we appreciated they cooked her some biscuits anyways. If you get fried food, keep in mind there is a bit of a wait. There is one cook handling it all and frying takes a while. That was one of the few cons, but perhaps you can call ahead your order so it'll be ready when you get there to dine in.   Keep in mind they have 3 slightly different menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also the prices change during the time of day as well. My chicken lunch was $10 vs $16 for dinnertime. I think at $10 it was worth it, but I don't know about $16.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this place.",

We loved the open kitchen and the friendly staff - we came in around 8:30 and didn't realize they closed at 9, but they still took our four orders (two to go, two dine-in) and let us stay and chat well past closing.   The cornbread is quite unique and the butter made it slightly on the salty side. I ordered the lemonade and was completely unprepared for the sweetness I was to experience from the first sip. Crystal brought me half a glass of water to dilute it and that worked perfectly.   The catfish was heavily deep fried, as to be expected, and it was so yummy. I could've eaten everything as its own entree, and that includes the potato salad, Mac and cheese and yams. I'm so glad we chose against SmashBurger that night. I'll definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "Had lunch here yesterday for the first time. First impression: isn't really my style of restaurant. It has sort of a grungy casual feel. Decor is very minimal but I figured I'd let the food speak for itself so I stayed. My BF said he'd been here before and the food was good. I had the grilled red snapper, black eyed peas, rice and mac 'n cheese. The sauce on the grilled red snapper was very lightly seasoned with red bell peppers but the fish itself impressed me. So fresh and fleshy, soft and flavorful! I got two large pieces of filet-ed, unskinned  fish that was filling and delicious! I imagined being back on South Beach somewhere at a restaurant near the sea having this fish dish.   My sides weren't worth remembering. Everything was clumpy like it was cooked a long time ago and reheated and I really don't get why they put everything in separate little plates. It was very awkward to eat from a large plate and bunch of mini plates on the table. I ended up just dumping everything into one large plate but it felt like I had to build my own meal. Tasted some of my bf's fried catfish and it was good but a bit salty. It also tasted like Zatarans and corn meal so nothing special that I can't make at home. I've had better so I can't dub thee the  #1 Soul Food in Las Vegas but it's worth a try.  Overall I would come again just for that freshly wild-caught, salt-water, grilled Red Snapper with all it's succulent, chunky, meaty goodness that reminded me of the Caribbean!   P.S. Prices here are a bit high so make sure you come packing especially for dinner but my grilled Red Snapper lunch with two sides is just $11.99. My extra side was another $4.50 and canned soda was $1.60 or so.",

He pulled it apart and it dripped into his plate.. My chicken HAS to be cooked all the way through. He isn't one to complain so he just ate around it.

I had the catfish which was seasoned perfectly and was served extremly hot and fresh.  The fried okra was the best I've had at a restaurant ever.  The hushpuppies were well seasoned and the corn bread was sweet and delicious.  My guest had the smothered chicken which was fried chicken smothered with gravy.  The dish was delicious, as well as the collard green side. The unfortunate thing is that the service, while polite and friendly, was extremely slow.  The food came out in spurts with our cornbread first,then the fries, then the rest of our sides, then my guest's chicken, then after a few minutes (it seemed like an eternity) my catfish finally came out.  I will be hard pressed to come back here for lunch due to time restraints.",

    "text": "I waited to write this review in hopes that that management or the owner would respond to my email, but of course not, just more of the same thing, UNPROFESSIONAL-ISM .I called in the early evening to order only ONE plate of food. The lady that answered had no personality and is border line rude. First, she tells me its going to be 30 minutes for my order, and then after I ordered it it went down to 15. I dropped by there 25 minutes later to pick my food up, Surely it would be done right? WRONG! I patiently tried to wait, but after 15 minutes past the 25, I walked up to find out what was going on. The same lady that answered the phone waited on me with rolling eyes and attitude. No apology or anything. Sadly for me the guy had just dropped the chicken for my order .Now its 45 minutes later. There was no sense of urgency, as I watched the cook walk back and forth leaving the kitchen doing absolutely nothing. After just about an hour my original 15 minute order was done. Something told me when I went to the car to check my food.The order was wrong.I went back inside so frustrated at this point that I asked for my money back. My appetite was gone at this point .Again, no apology, just a look of bewilderment, and asking me what's wrong with the food. The lady continued on to tell me that she had to call someone to come in to return my money! What kind of business are these people running, where the employees have to call someone to drive in for a refund? Yea I really want to wait another hour to get my money back. Absolutely absurd. Long story short. Horrible staff,no organization and sadly I wouldn't know about the food, but that the order was wrong. Another word of advice to this place, get your peach cobbler of the lowest rack near the floor. That has to be some kind of health issue. I wouldn't even take it for free when they tried to give it to me, for all of my trouble. Hilarious!  I did forget to add that part.",

The waiter/host/server is VERY hospitable, accommodating, friendly and patient! Which makes this dining experience tasteful, enjoyable and satisfying.   My pictures tells you what I ordered from the user friendly menu. The Oxtail was succulent and bursting with flavor! The cabbage was flavorful and the red beans and rice is decadent.   Every spoonful was ooh so gratifying and scrumptious! You will not be disappointed  you will leave bellyful and wanting more. Just remember it's a small family owned and operated business away from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip serving wholesome Soul Food.   I WILL be back!",

Beyond that, the staff was very friendly, accommodated our large group quickly and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed at all times!

The two of them had fried catfish and fried red snapper then my boyfriend had grilled red snapper. The sides we had were greens that were bland, mac and cheese that tasted weird and fried okra that actually was good. Now my Aunt got fried red snapper which was a decent portion and my boyfriend got the grilled red snapper. Well the fried portion was way bigger than the grilled. So, he said something to the waitress and she said I'll bring you another piece of grilled Snapper. When she bright out the other piece of snapper I looked at it and told my boyfriend that's not snapper that's Tilapia. Can you believe it. I was so shocked then my so-called smothered chicken had been fried so long that it was tough. Plus there serving Jiffy Cornbread and passing that off as home made hot water cornbread. $120.00 later I just have to say that the food was mediocre and way overpriced. I will never bring another person to this place. It was truly a disappointment. To the owner. You should be ashamed of yourself and you need lessons on how to cook, run an a restaurant and price your food accordingly. Wow",

Again for those prices at least have Pandora or something without commercials playing. It's annoying to hear a loud accident lawyer commercial playing. Now let's move on to the food. The only thing that was somewhat enjoyable was the yams. Nothing else was good at all.  Fried chicken was over salted due to the fact that they dont season the meat. They throw a whole bunch of seasoning salt after its fried. They cut my breast up before frying it which made it dry.  The catfish wasnt catfish. It was portioned  small like the size of a cheese stick. It was fried so hard that the meat was dry and this had no seasoning.   The rice and beans, mac and cheese, fried okra, and potato salad were all blah. Not to mention sent out lukewarm.  We also ordered the hot links that were burnt to a crisp on the outside and cold in the middle.  Due to this I will not be returning here.",

Their card reader was down so only accepts cash. Best of Las Vegas signs from 2014 and 2015, y'all need to take it down cuz y'all far from it. Food was nasty, had fried rice- big chunks of egg like y'all weren't even busy so it's no excuse. Spent $40 on food that went straight to the trash. Workers were arguing with each other. Dirty- tables not clean. Hot mess. Ghetto. Never recommending.",

    "text": "So it's field Friday and my partner and I decided to roll through here.  Apparently, she has a plug here and got loads of catered delivery ranging from chicken, ribs and other mouth watering comfort favorites.    Of course, I took full advantage of the free Yelp check-in offer, free small side!  I been on that back in the dizzle crave so had to go with the liver and onions, naturally.  Sides included cornbread, fried okra, yams and potato salad.  My partner got the chicken and waffles and house cornbread order.  When asked about drinks, our waitress Latrice, went over the drinks and mentioned a sugar momma and sugar daddy. We was rolling, I asked how old was the former, and likewise my partner regarding the latter...too hilarious!  We stuck with water and lemon after a good chuckle.  The restaurant can be food nestled in the north east corner of the shopping center, next door to the barber shop, no generalizing please.  It can be in the cut, in fact, I think that is what the barber shop is named next door...lol.    The place is simply decorated and well kept with a large view of the kitchen area.  The walls are adorned with some boxing and sporting memorabilia and sure it will build through time.  The staff is warm and friendly and attentive.    The servings are above average and very filling in addition to the various sides that can be ordered.  This place has good comfort food, but there wasn't anything that stood out.  Then again, I have not tried everything yet, so think its fair to rate this place a \"3\" for the time being and will be updated accordingly as I frequent.  The best thing about the place is the location since there is not much soul food in the lower southwest area.  This provides that needed flavor to satisfy any craving if you are in the mood for good southern food.",

The fried oysters were extremely salty  which made me paranoid about eating them (so I didn't even finish one).  The crab cakes were pre-formed and reminded me of store bought.  The crab cakes were okay,  but bland compared to what I'm used to getting  at other restaurants.   The potato salad was yellow in color as if a lot of egg yolk was used in the recipe;  the flavor was better than packaged potato salad from the store.  The hush puppies were too salty.   The corn bread pancake was tasty.   I threw away most of it.   Overall it was an overpriced disappointment.",

    "text": "My first and LAST time here!  As soon as I got here, I checked in on Yelp. This was my first time coming here and it said I earned a 50% off coupon. Right off the bat I KNEW they would try to find some way to skate out of letting me use the (first timers) Yelp coupon... and that's EXACTLY what they did.  You see, they have 3 eating 'times': Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Lunch ENDS at 3 PM. So, quite naturally, it should have been assumed by the 2 female waitresses that I WAS ORDERING DINNER as I arrived there at 4 PM... a whole HOUR AFTER 3 pm when lunch supposedly 'ended'. The coupon clearly said DINNER (see attached photo)... and that's exactly what time I was there for... DINNER... When I pointed out the Yelp coupon to the waitress, she said \"Well, you got the lunch portion\"... and THAT's how they avoided letting me use the coupon. Here's the problem though. AT NO POINT did either one of the 2 waitresses ask me if I was ordering lunch or dinner. And they shouldn't have to ask because I was clearly there DURING DINNER HOURS. When I asked her what the difference between 'lunch' and 'dinner' was... she basically said THE PORTION SIZE and THE PRICE. Ok, that's fine... but why on God's Green Earth would you bring me a lunch portion when lunch was clearly (according to your own menu) OVER MORE THAN AN HOUR AGO. She then elaborated on how \"dinner can be ordered any time\"... which begs the question (from anyone with a working brain), \"If dinner can be ordered at any time, then WHY do you even have a 'dinner time'\" ???  So, I ordered the grilled snapper plate.  Before the actual meal arrived, they gave us this sweet cornbread pancake. It was honestly the only surprisingly good thing about this place. The 2 sides I ordered along with my 'lunch plate' were red beans and rice, and greens.  The Grilled Red Snapper: The portion size was incredibly disappointing. I thought I would be getting a WHOLE snapper grilled... or at least a WHOLE FILET... NOPE! They literally gave me 1/4 of the size of fish. This little piece of fish they gave me could LITERALLY fit in the palm of my hand. The onions and peppers they put on top of the fish were bigger then the fish itself. I finished that little piece of crap in 4 bites! Although it tasted good, it had more of a Tex-Mex flavor to it than a Southern style, should food, or even New Orleans style flavor.... sheesh!  The Red Beans and Rice: I swear I think they poursed some Bush's beans (or 'some' type of canned beans) over some clumpy white rice. This didn't taste home-made AT ALL. It literally tasted like something out of a can. They even had those nasty little old meat chunks that you get in the can. They didn't even cook the rice right either. It was sticky and clumpy like one bog mushy ball.  The greens: This was bland as hell. No REAL seasoning whatsoever. I was wondering if these were 'turkey greens'... but here's the weird thing. I found a piece of a turkey bone at the bottom of the greens. Yet, there wasn't a single piece of turkey or peppers in the whole bowl. I wouldn't be surprised if this came out of a can as well. It had that 'canned greens' taste to it.  I LEFT THEM NO TIP! They weren't willing to honor a Yelp coupon that THEY set up... so I refuse to honor their crappy service and crappy food with a TIP. My suggestion to ANYONE reading this, is that, if you're looking for some REAL/GOOD soul food, try T.C.'s Rib Crib on Durango. They have good portion sizes, decent prices, better taste... and they don't need some crappy coupon scam to sucker you in. SHAME ON YOU GUYS AT Soul Food Cafe!",

Ive never been a fan of m and m s, so if you like that you'll  slap yourself for not coming here instead.  I was referred  by a friend security  for money mayweather so of course there were pics of them all over the walls. Kinda worried that the food may not be that great cause the place is empty.  Ordered oxtail with gravy, cabbage, yams, rice and gravy  and extra side of mac and cheese.  Asked about lunch portion and was told they dont serve oxtails as lunch only dinner.  Remembered previous yelper said something  about 50% off dinner but after further investigation  realized its bogo 50% dine in only.    Oxtails were fall off the bone tender.  Cabbage a lil overcooked and a tad bit salty to my liking  but i like my veggies with a lil firm not necessarily  crunchy  but not soggy but still edible.  Yams  good, not too sweet.  Gravy great, I rarely  like other people's  gravy.  mac and cheese, first let me say this ....Restaurants  dont be afraid to make mac and cheese a premium  side to pay for the cost of cheese.  With that being said there wasnt enough cheese in the macaroni...but hey the noodles  were flavored well lol.  Oh yeah kool aid, straight out the projects from house party good.  Ill be back",

    "text": "This review is based not just on their tasty fried chicken, but the extreme attentiveness and integrity of the staff. Let's start with the little bit of drama we experienced tonight after my daughter found out she lost the small ring her nana had given her for Christmas. It doesn't have any real monetary value, but irreplaceable sentimental value. After some mental replays, my daughter's brilliant mama (aka moi :) suggested she call up Soul Food Cafe as it was the last place we went before coming home and ask if they found a ring. She spoke to Dominique, who informed her they did find her ring and would be keeping it safe until we could go back down and get it. The color returned to my daughter's face as she breathed a sigh of relief.  This was not the first incident we witnessed of the people at Soul Food Cafe going above and beyond service in one day. While we were dining, we couldn't help but overhear the conversation of the staff and manager as they took care of an okra misunderstanding amongst some regular lady diners seated next to us. The manager made sure to let them know how important they are and made generous reparations to ensure their satisfaction. It seems the whole staff are just very friendly, smile and make everyone feel at home. I am happy to give them the extra star because of the staff.   Now on to the food....  We both ordered the CHICKEN & WAFFLES (3 wings) with an extra side of GREENS and CORN BREAD. It took some time to get the order out, but well worth the wait. The wings came out plump, hot and crispy with the right amount of seasoning. The CORNBREAD pancake was wonderful...light, sweet and the perfect accompaniment to our meal. I could eat a whole stack of these. The WAFFLE was how a Sunday morning waffle should be...thin, crisp and moist. The syrup was gooey and good for dipping. The GREENS are just as good as our friend D's homemade greens that we use a benchmark. Balanced flavors of sour, sweet, salty with bits of ham hock. We enjoyed sopping up the greens broth with our waffle.  This was a great roll up your sleeves and get-ready-to-eat experience that we will come back time and again to enjoy.",

    "text": "Driving through Vegas after the convention, the squad was hungry and we didn't know what we wanted to eat. With a quick browse on yelp, we found \"Soul Food Cafe\" and were immediately struck. Not only was it called \"soul food\", but the reviews were good and the photos confirmed our excitement to try something new. As we pull up, the store front is simple, and not extra like a lot of spots try to be in Vegas. Nothin to front. As we all rushed in, we were greeted n seated at a table with a smile and some simple menus that showed some great comfort eats. Fried chicken and waffles for three of us, and meatloaf for the forth made for an enticing wait. Admittedly at first glance we were haters of the prices that initially seemed a bit high from our normal budgets (we broke boiis) but as soon as the made to order food was served, we knew that everything was boutta be gucci. Two of the orders came out as wings instead of breast but that was immediately brought to attention by our lovely host and another new batch was made right away. I've only tried the mainstream fried chicken spots but damn, this was one of the best I've had. The unexpected johnny cakes (flat cornbread) was absolutely amazing, the waffles were golden and had a kiss of cinnamon flavor, the syrup wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like some places, the butter was on point, and of course the chicken, both the wings and the breast pieces were lit. The fried portion was crispy, clean, and damn tasty. The chicken itself was filling, juicy, and the squad literally all said \"oh. yo. I f*ck with this heavy.\" Needless to say, the lovely hospitality, amazing food, and good environment calls for a hopeful revisit soon. Maybe even for breakfast as the menu looked promising for that as well. Love from our team to the Soul Food fam. Ya'll are all winners.",

    "text": "Short version: Came here with my wife and son on a Saturday night, and the place was busy and understaffed. The food was excellent, though, and made up for the hit-or-miss service by the overworked-but-friendly waitress. Perfect if you're hankering for a deep fried, barbecued, or slathered-in-gravy food fix.  Longer version: This unassuming place is nestled around the corner of the Albertsons shopping center at the SE corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs. Football played on both TV screens, and the small seating area was pretty crowded. The staff was friendly and inviting.  We received: Cornbread - Their cornbread is cooked like pancakes and served as complimentary appetizers as well as with most entrees. Crispy, chewy, and buttery. Very nice.  BBQ Ribs with Yams, Fried Okra, and Mac & Cheese - The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and they were slathered in a thick, sweet sauce. Messy as all hell, until I realized they were so tender I could flake the meat off with a fork and eat it that way. - AMAZING yams, cooked with plenty of brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter. Most dinner entrees include 3 sides, and if I had known the yams were this good I would've ordered the yams as all 3. VERY sweet, so if that's not your thing, they may not be as good for you. - The fried okra was decent, although there were some messy burned up chunks of fries in with the okra. - The mac & cheese is thick and cheesy, although best eaten while it's still hot and the cheese hasn't started to solidify too much.  Fried Catfish with Rice & Gravy, Mac & Cheese, and Hush Puppies - Coated in cornmeal breading, this entree includes 2 giant slabs of catfish. My wife ordered this, and claims it's some of the best fried catfish she's ever had in Vegas. I'm not a huge catfish person, so it seems quite good, but it's not really my thing. - The rice & gravy was good, although we asked for more gravy because it didn't seem like there was enough on it. - Because they were understaffed/overworked, they just kind of forgot about the hush puppies. They brought them later, but it was late enough that we just had them bring them to go.  Kids Meal of Chicken Fingers and Fries - I'm not sure why they list them as chicken fingers, because what came out were chicken wings (which isn't listed on the kids menu). Good fried chicken wings, sure, but not what we were expecting.  Peach Cobbler - We ordered the small serving, and yet it was more than enough for the table, consisting of a large bowl loaded with cobbler. Almost syrupy sweet, which can be both a good and bad thing. It was very tasty, although it might send you into a sugary food coma.  Sugar Momma drink - Their version of an Arnold Palmer, using southern sweet tea instead of regular tea with the lemonade. DELICIOUS. Definitely ordering this again.  Overall, the food was great and we had a positive experience. Hopefully the staffing thing was an aberration, because the food is good enough to warrant a visit.",

    "text": "By no means am I a soul food expert but if the dish is fried, covered in gravy or sauce or all the above then COUNT ME IN.  It was pretty busy when we walked in on a Tuesday night.  They had the soul classics blaring through the speakers while the Lakers were on TV with their new lineup was tanking it against the Mavericks.  So far, so good!  Their menu offered all the soul offerings you would expect like fried chicken, ribs, fried catfish and all the usual suspects for sides.  My wife opted for the smothered chicken ($14) which was fried chicken drenched in gravy.  That was excellent.  The gravy was really good but we would consider ordering fried chicken with a side of gravy so we could enjoy the crisp of the chicken which was nonexistent post smothering.    I opted for the turkey wings ($14) which consisted of 2 big assed baked turkey wings smothered in gravy.  Even though the gravy was the same for both, they tasted quite different based on the preparation of the meat.    You get 3 sides per entree unless you get chicken and waffles.  3 sides is more than enough and all the ones we tried were on point.  That included collard greens in some amazing sauce, delectably sweet sweet potatoes, red rice and beans with great sausage flavor and the mac+cheese.  The cornbread they gave was in pancake form and went terrific with syrup.  No free refills on drinks and they charge $1.50 for water so you might as well get sweet tea, Kool Aid or lemonade for $2.  Breakfast menu also looked damn good.  I'd like to try that out sometime too.",

We both got chicken and waffles. The chicken tasted like someone dumped it in a bag of seasoning salt! My boyfriend could only eat one wing because he started feeling ill from all the sodium. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and the fact that I ate so much salt on my chicken left me concerned. I had to go home and guzzle a few bottles of water. We both enjoyed the waffles. Service was okay. We were the only table in the restaurant and it seemed the waitress was struggling. Don't think I'll be back any time soon!",

We got the Hotlink dinner with collard greens, fries, and potato salad and the fried catfish with yams, mac & cheese and green beans. AMAZING! Everything was super delicious! The potato salad was a little too mustard-y for me but my boyfriend liked it. Other than that this place fulfilled every craving we came in with!  The only reason for the knocked star is because 1. The decorations, seating arrangements and tables kind of reminded me of a school cafeteria. 2. There were no uniforms or anything everyone just kinda looked like they were at home and 3. For a $50 tab I would of expected a little more... class? I guess you could say..??  We will definitely be back because the food was impeccable however we will only be coming for lunch because the dinner prices are a little outrageous.",

    "text": "Luck, they say, is when preparation meets opportunity. Or when the first soul food place you were planning to go to is closed and someone recommends another spot which is a 20m drive away yet you go reluctantly.  But that's what happened to myself and friends and we are all so thankful for it. I truly don't understand how this place has less than four stars. I've eaten soul food all over the country, from the backwoods of Alabama to the best of Biloxi and beyond and the fried chicken right here ranks up there with the best of them. Skin so crispy you could sell them separately as pork rinds and no one would know the difference.  But let's start from the beginning. It truly is a cafe -- a small place where everything is cooked to order. They start you off with a cornbread pancake that is just buttery and divine. I had the fried chicken, one of my friends ordered the pork chops and we agreed to share. Both were delicious. For sides, I had fried okra, red beans and rice and mac and cheese. Everything was great except the mac and cheese which was just decent, but still good because it tasted to fresh. Free refills on drinks too btw.  Our server was just wonderful. She gave me an extra side of greens for the rest of the food that I couldn't finish (hearty servings here). I had low expectations for finding good soul food in the desert. Now that I'm in greener pastures, my lips are parched, yearning for that chicken once again.",

It was fairly easy to get to and was located at the end of a strip mall. Upon entering I was greeted immediately by the staff and took a seat at an available table. They brought out warm cornbread/corncake which was good. I ordered the smothered pork chop with sides of rice and gravy and collard greens. There is a bit of a wait because the food is prepared fresh. My porkchop was piping hot! Fried and smothered to perfection. The rice and gravy complemented it well and the collard greens were delicious. They were fresh, not from a can. I also had koolaid mixed with lemonade. (They have a name for it but I can't remember the name.) Excellent service. They did have a sign saying it is cash only. I will return next time I'm in town.",

While I can't say I love it here, Soul Food Cafe does have its perks.  The cornbread was delicious. It was served pancake style which I am definitely not used to. However, the buttery rich flavor came through perfectly. I almost had to order 3 more! The smothered pork chop was average. A deep fried pork chop completely covered in gravy. The gravy was a little salty on its own - but in combination with the lightly seasoned pork chop - it was not bad at all. I would eat it again. The sides were my least favorite. I love fried okra but these little guys had way too much salt on them. The mac and cheese needed one ingredient...cheese. It was bland and sort of felt like eating plain macaroni noodles.  The Kool Aid here is on point! I mean you can probably keep pouring water in it and have at least two cups. Made the way Kool Aid should be.  The staff was pleasant. Not exactly overly friendly but they took care of everything we needed and asked for.   For the most part, we had a good experience here.",

I will agree that the food is overpriced, but it is delicious so I don't let that keep me away.  They have a great selection of items and I'm sooo relieved that the entrees come with sides majority of the time.  Lunch portions come with 2 sides and cornbread whilst dinner portions come with 3 sides and cornbread.  There is nothing special about the potato salad but everything else I don't have any complaints about.  I am obsessed with the grilled chicken; so much so that I haven't tried any other entree so far lol.  The \"sugar mama\" is my drink of choice..perfect blend of iced tea and lemonade.  Definitely keeps your thirst satisfied during these hot summer days.  Also, they ask for ID with any card you're using which is not advertised so make sure you don't forget to bring it along with you like I have.  I am looking forward to my next meal here!",

The order was placed 15 minutes before I arrived and I sat there for a good 15-20 minutes. Seem like nice and good people but if you're picking up food or trying to work, don't go here.",

I'm just gonna start with the fact that my Mac n cheese was like mashed and cheese. The noodles were mush...they should have thrown that in the trash. The chef knows what acceptable and not. They don't care - they will put it on a plate and serve it anyway. The other items the greens and stuff was very salty. They need to take a break and restart. Bad business to serve food of that quality when you are charging $20 a plate.",

    "text": "We have picked up to go orders from Soul Food Cafe a few times and tonight was the first time we dined in.  It was pretty busy when we arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, lots of people coming in and out picking up orders.  We sat down and was waited on by a very cheerful waitress.  Our drinks came out pretty quick, and then we waited...and waited...I noticed a lot of people coming in to pick up orders and they were also waiting for quite a while.  Seems they only have two people cooking in the open air kitchen and three people taking orders/waiting tables. Lots of confusion among the waitresses as there were a lot of people calling and picking up and there was quite a bit of wrong orders going out.  We finally get our cornbread pancake first- warm, large and sweet, they were the size of a small plate and were fluffy and quite good.  Next came our sides and a few minutes later our entrees. The sides were all very tasty, collard greens were not over cooked, potato salad was flavorful with what seems like relish, mac and cheese was good and yams were overly sweet (but the mister liked them).  I had the fried chicken, they were perfectly seasoned and the skin (my favorite part) was crispy. The mister had the smothered chicken and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  I also ordered a small order of chitterlings for $7 and it was horrendous.  I've had chitterlings once before in another soul food place in San Francisco and it wasn't bad so I wanted to try theirs.  Let me start by saying that I am an adventurous eater, I eat just about everything and anything.  I grew up eating innards (intestines, tripe, heart, kidneys, liver, pork/chicken/duck blood..I even LOVE balut!) so for me intestines is nothing new BUT good god, the chitterlings here were just awful..I took the first bite and nearly gagged.  I put some hot sauce on it and tried again, thinking maybe I just had a bad piece, nope, second bite was just as bad.  Two bites and that was enough for me, they just did not taste clean at all!  If it wasn't for their fried chicken and great sides as a saving grace, this review would probably be pretty bad.  I wanted to try their oxtails too but the table next to us ordered it and the woman sent it back....I know some of the items on their menu is actually pretty good (chicken and fried fish) so I'll be back again and hope to update my review as I really like to support local mom and pop places.  Plus, they have Niner logos everywhere so you know I gotta give them props for that :)",

The take out ordered contained one or 2 day old FRIED chicken that was too dry & tough to chew. The Mac& Cheese tasted as if someone stumbled with the salt box aimed directly into the mixing bowl. The corn bread was soggy as if water had been spilled on it. I am a 74 year old who have NEVER had food that was NOT AT ALL EDIBLE. I would have had my son return it, but he had driven 40 minutes to get it and that was before the heavy/work traffic. By the time he got to my house with it it would have taken  an hour (each way)  to return it. It ended up in the garbage disposal. Not sure if this was just one of their off days or?? But I will not take the risk of patronizing this place again.",

I don't like the open kitchen because od the various fumes and food odor and the mess inside is visible too. This why if you like their food it's better to take a delivery.   I have been here and ordered delivery several times. Not all of their dishes are tasty, prepared and seasoned well. My favorite dishes are The Catfish and The Chicken and Waffles. I love the Cornbread, as well, it's very tasty.  Overall, this is a standard place with average food, you can find better places to eat.",

This will be our new place to dine whenever we come to Vegas with the hope that Christine is there to serve us. Our dinner choice was ox tails, cat fish, spare ribs and chicken salad ..

Anyway, we did phone in for two oxtails dinners which were ready when I arrived.  However, after several attempts by staff, the card machine refused to work.  The staff explained that the machine often doesn't work and had been problematic all day.  She also said that there was an ATM  at the business next door I could get cash from to pay for the meal.  I politely,  refused and she tried the machine again without success.  Again she informed me of the services next.  I, again, politely said I was too tired after running around all day and would just come up with a plan b for dinner.  At the time, a male came from the kitchen informing me of how easy it is to go next door and... I replied that 'the owner' and was interrupted by him telling me he was the owner as he reiterated how easy it would be for me to get cash from next door.  I informed him that that was not an option for me because it would be an inconvenience for me.  Furthermore, I stated that until it was an inconvenience for him, the problem would remain an issue for his customers to bear.  We parted ways permanently.  I've never encountered a business practice of this nature and am amazed that there people that patronize a place that thinks so little of them.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE! I purchased a fried turkey here for Thanksgiving because it was the only place I'd heard was making them. I was told the turkey would be $125 without stuffing, 18-20 lbs and I could pick it up Thanksgiving morning before 10AM. I paid for the turkey in advance as they requested and was forewarned, THERE ARE NO REFUNDS. Thanksgiving eve, at last minutes notice, I was asked by the restaurant to pick up my Turkey because it was ready and I could no longer pick it up Thanksgiving day. It completely inconvenienced my night with family constantly arriving in town. The lady on the phone had no consideration for the fact I was being inconvenienced and even suggested I have a friend or family member come grab the turkey. So, I rush across town to be even more dissatisfied.  My 18-20 lb turkey was easily 8lbs max (understanding they shrink up to 20% once cooked, making it 10lbs originally). Further, it was sloppily thrown in an oversized pan and luke warm like it been cooked hours prior. My 1 star is for the turkey being edible. Overall, it was $125 waste of money and time.",

The barbers next door won't even fully endorse them, while getting haircut, the conversation was not favorable for Soul Food Cafe. Third (attempted) chance, I was ordering catfish A la carte, uh... Turns out there isn't an a la carte option for anything. I asked for cater menu, because that usually has bulk or a la carte style orders, but cater menu was basically in store menu xeroxed on paper.

Multiple pictures of Mayweather, even multiples of the same one. That's not too bad. Don't really care as long as it's clean.  But let's talk food. I ordered smothered chicken with Greens, Mac&Cheese and Yams. Paid 19 dollars after taxes. WAY OVER PRICED with hella small portions. Only bought it because the craving was that bad and with the reviews i'd give it a shot. By far THE WORST soul food place EVER. Pretty much gives m&m their credit back its that bad. The gravy on the chicken was bland. Had to add my own salt to give it a little flavor. The mac & cheese didn't taste like cheese, tasted like noodles with seasoning and chips. And the greens..main thing I went for, completely under done. The seasoning was like pepper type spices and that's it. If I were to make all that food myself, I would steal their customers off top. Now maybe some other stuff might be good, but for their prices, there is no way in hell in coming back here to try it again. Better off going to the soul food place inside the gas station on MLK and Owens if it's still there.",

    "text": "Soulless,   This is my second review of this place in as many weeks because I wanted to go back and see how consistent the food and the service were from my first trip.  God, have things changed.  My first review was glowing; I gave it four stars. Now, Soul Food Cafe barely earns one; here's why:  At my last visit, the meatloaf was among the best I've had anywhere in the country. You could savor the quality of the beef on your tongue as the meat mixed with the fat as it mixed with the spices as those mixed with the rich, dark gravy. It was that good. The gravy was the gold-plating on the dish. Most everything else that I or my girlfriend had was either very good or great (read first review below).  This time, however, the meatloaf was dry, hard almost like a roofing tile (I swear, I almost refused to pay for it) and came with no gravy (although I specifically asked for it). The black eyed peas tasted like a salt lick, and the rice and gravy was a warm, tasteless paste like the kind they'd serve us in elementary school. Gross.  The tea tasted like it came from a powder, the potato salad tasted old and I swear the chocolate cake this time could have come from a grocery store.  I'm not trying to slam these people. My first visit was incredible. In fact, I was psyched that Vegas finally had a great soul food restaurant. But in a matter of days this place has gone downhill. It tastes like what you'd get at some cafeteria that caters to folks in their 80s, where everything is stale, old and bland.  I'll give this place one more shot, but it'll be months before I do. These people had such a great start. They need to get it together before they lose more customers.  Read original review below:  Simmering in Soul  I wanted to marry the meatloaf. Right there on the spot, in front of the chef and everybody. I had only been there 10 minutes. Truth is, I didn't know what to expect from Soul Food Cafe, the newest such joint in the valley. My girlfriend and I have almost always been disappointed by the lesser-quality soul food spots in town, so we didn't have high hopes. But two bites into the meatloaf (in the picture I took here), and I felt like I was back home in the South, where we're steeped in gravy and simmered in iced tea. This place is the first soul food restaurant here where the high-quality ingredients match the ability of the chefs to churn out the kind of soul food that tastes like it's right out of your mama's kitchen. I think I'm on record about how great the meatloaf was - perfectly seasoned with a slight crust swaddling the thick, warm slices of soul on a plate. The mustard potato salad is the best I've had anywhere in Vegas at any restaurant, but the mac and cheese was a little dry. The book-size slab of chocolate cake, however, more than made up for it. My girlfriend had a perfectly fried piece of catfish with a side of sweet potatoes she loved and a dish of greens that while cooked with either smoked turkey or ham (it was hard to tell) tasted, she said, \"flat and needed soul.\" That's a serious deficiency for a soul food restaurant, but the rest of the food is good enough to make up for the lapse. I should add that she ate her banana pudding so fast I barely got a look at it, much less a taste.  Lunches come with two sides; dinners come with three. All meals are also served with crispy, buttery cornbread cakes that are as good as any I've ever had anywhere in the country. That's not an overstatement. If, like us, you have a deep-seated love for soul food and have been disappointed by what's available in Vegas, you'll probably love Soul Food Cafe. They've only been open about a week, and they're obviously working out some kinks, but this is seriously good food at fair prices cooked by a staff who know what they're doing and have the skill to satisfy your hankerings. Oh, the wait staff is also very good: attentive, friendly, efficient. Give Soul Food Cafe a shot.  I know we'll be back soon.",

Several reviews stated that this meal was dry and over cooked. I had almost been convinced until I  changed my mind to give it a try to come to my own conclusion. So glad that I did! The liver was perfectly prepared and tasty. Taught me a valuable lesson.. Don't trust every negative review that you read. Some people just may not want you to give certain places of their choosing, your business for no good reason. Gather your own opinions and go from there. Don't miss out on some great meals!",

    "text": "I went here the first week they opened and it was great! I had the fried chicken meal with Mac and Cheese and Fried Okra as my sides and one of the delicious Kool-Aid drinks on the side. The fried chicken is really good. The outer crust is flaky and light the meat is fresh and hot. The mac is cheese is pretty good as well. not the best I've ever tasted, but definitely not the worst. The fried Okra was excellent!   The only negative things I can mention are the the wait times and the portions. I know soul food can take a while but when you've only got a one hour lunch break you can just hear the time ticking away as you wait 30 minutes for your food. In addition, the servings were bigger when they first opened, it seems they've cut back for whatever reason on the sizes...maybe to save money? Who knows. But when one of my coworkers receives half a piece of catfish in her combo....well nothing good can come from that.  All in all it's great to have a soul food restaurant on this side of town with a friendly staff.",

Once we received our food, my sisters cat fish was burnt to the point that it tasted like fish sticks. My rice with my oxtails was cold and the service was horrible. My sister chose not to complain because the server seemed so overwhelmed and irritated that she just ate what should could to keep the peace. After we ate we waited 15min to receive a bill and a box for my leftovers. After receiving our bill it took another 15 min for the server to acknowledge us because she was filling to go orders. No one else stepped up to help us. We left smelling like burnt oil and completely dissatisfied after spending $60 on bad service and mediocre food.",

    "text": "I wasn't too pleased with the food o my first visit but Shila (the owner) messaged me to come back in and try the chicken and waffles again on the house. I didn't like how seasoned the chicken was the first time and though the waffle was soggy, so she advised me to tell the waitress light seasoning. The waitress was a little slow at first but was very nice . She talked to Shila  on the phone and surprisingly she remembered my name and told the waitress exactly how to make my chicken and waffles--light on seasoning and butter on the side. Was very impressed with how attentive the owner was in making sure I was happy.  -Corn bread was still AMAZING  -Chicken was a little dry but definitely seasoned better than the first time. Rated really good! -waffle was a little les soggy but still didn't have crunch to it  Service was mediocre.  brought my water right away without even taking my order, but didn't ask me for lemon or if I wanted anything else to drink like she did to other tables didn't make eye contact and walked off as soon as she gave me food was able to keep up with 3 tables and phone calls quickly  remembered to tell the cook light seasoning & butter on the side",

Maybe he was having a bad cook day, because judging by the food I received,  his day was off. I requested white meat, which I got. But it was like 'the chicken taste like wood\", it was dry beyond... it was not seasoned at all. I ordered cabbage, they gave me greens. To say I was dissatisfied, and disappointed is an understatement. I usually don't complain about the prices, but it is not worth $20.00 for an unpleasant meal. If they continue like this, they won't last.",

The waffles were also the perfect texture and sweetness. My only complaint is the seasoning on the chicken wings were on the saltier side. We had also ordered the smothered chicken, greens, and mac and cheese. The smothered chicken was covered in delicious gravy and the chicken skin stayed crispy, giving this dish a nice balance of texture and flavor. The staff was also very friendly and I liked the simplicity of the restaurant. It is also in a great location.

    "text": "I went here with a group of my friends after we had a basketball game and we had a good time chilling here and eating.   The restaurant is small, but not small to the point where they couldn't seat a party of 8. What I liked about the restaurant is that they have two TVs going on, one had the Sunday night football game (in which my Indianapolis Colts were playing, go Colts!) and one where they had 8 Mile playing.   We sat down, got our waters, and ordered. I heard a lot about their cornbread previously and so I definitely wanted to try that. Little did I know that everybody that dines in (for dinner at least) gets cornbread! I was happy and when it was served... Man that was good cornbread! That was rated GAF right there. The orders will come out a little slow, especially if they have to fry your food, so expect a little day for that reason, but it comes our fresh and hot, so you can't really argue with that. I personally ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle was my favorite part. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it and it was crispy. The chicken was pretty good, but I personally have a hard time eating the wings, in which I opted for the three wings instead of the breast.   I was a little confused as far as the service went because we never got refills and I didn't know if we should just go and get it ourselves since there was a fountain that we could all access, and so we just got the refills ourselves. My friend's brother got the kids chicken basket and that wasn't that great. It wasn't like the crispy breaded chicken fingers you would expect, it was this long strip of chicken and the outside was a little tough and the inside was kind of dry. For a young kid, or very many people in fact, they may not like that, so possibly opt for something else for kids. The dinner menu is also a bit pricier than the breakfast and lunch menu, but all dinner entrees, besides the chicken and waffles, comes with three sides.  Overall, I had a nice time. I definitely would come back here, maybe not for dinner, but possibly breakfast or lunch, for I found those menus to be more worth its value.",

As someone who loves soul food, I would definitely eat here more often, but it's not worth the headache.  I've been living in Vegas over a year and just finished my third (and final) visit to this establishment.  They get no more chances.  The last time I visited they told me they were closed and it was only 8:15pm.  Constant messed up orders, running out of sides after you've been waiting forever, attitude from employees and overall bad customer experience is going to drive this business to be no more.

From the warm pancake cornbread that they serve on the house to the koolaid they make. It's like I'm a kid all over again.   I have the fired snapper every time! Nothing really compares in my book when it comes to fried food. They make a house vinegar that's so light and goes perfect!   Jose hasn't moved past their chicken and waffles. And let's not forget about their homemade syrup. It's the most gooey velvet syrup so full of flavor.   We couldn't pass the peach cobbler ... Wow   This is a small place and it does get packed. It's opened for breakfast lunch and dinner.",

I got the chicken waffles with breast (THERE WAS  NO BONES IN IT HOW AWESOME AND IT WAS HUGE), corn bread which was to die for it was definitely homemade, I also tried the short ribs, grilled cheese, mac and cheese, fries, and smothered chicken. The food was priced so reasonably unlike other soul food places.  Everything was awesome! The fries you wouldn't expect, they are literally so huge and fried with this awesome breading. Everything came out in a timely manner and our server was so so sweet. She made sure our drinks were always filled and asked us frequently if we needed anything.  The only downside was that their credit card machine has been down for a few weeks now but that's okay, just bring some cash!   I will definitely be back!",

Mostly, I just didn't feel the price was worth what I got. I had takeout fried chicken dinner. It came to about 22 I believe. That's a pretty outta control price for a 5 PC fried chicken dinner. The beans tastes like out of a can with salt and pepper added. The collards were ok. The chicken was ok too. The fried chicken wings had the most flavor.  The food was ok, but if the price was 14 or so I'd have been much happier. I don't mind paying for quality, but DAMN, 20+ for fried chicken gets you a 12 PC bucket and sides any other place I've ever been too aside from restaurants.   I just didn't see the value for the $ but everything else was good. If the chicken blew me away I wouldn't have minded the price, which is expect it to at $20+. It didn't, but I thought the service was fantastic and the food pretty average.",

So we  tried again today, (called first) and they were still open. When we got there it was empty but clean. We were greeted soon as we came thru the doors. They were patient with us being that we were new to this spot and had to figure out what we wanted to order. So my sister ordered the fried chicken wings (3 sides) black eye peas, greens and yams and she loves it. She thought she was going to need to add salt and pepper but no need. Seasoned perfectly. I order the BBQ rib dinner with (3 sides) yams, greens and rice and gravy. OMG the ribs are SOOOO tender that the meat is falling of the bones. I would come here again and recommend anyone to go here. It's nice to get something that is home cooked and not at a casino.",

Order again today and their response time was way better for them call me put me on hold to tell me the delivery would be 2 hours  instead of 60 minutes. It wasn't a problem because I  really wanted to try the food because I read good reviews... 3 mins later the young lady calls me back to tell me it will be even longer because there's actually 3 orders for delivery in front of me. I kind of mention that I've been having issues trying to get food delivered. The young lady proceeded to tell me \"maybe I don't understand\"... I don't think there's too much to understand when e24 says delivery will be within 60 minutes and she's tell me 3 hours. I just told her maybe they should look into that she said \"maybe you don't understand it's just because we have 3 people in front of you\". It doesn't matter how many people are in front of me it should be an accurate delivery time estimating 30 min gap is a estimate  2 hours us just misleading and frustrating .

Strange thing, she ordered rice and gravy as a side. The gravy on the rice and gravy was totally different than the gravy on the smothered chicken. The gravy on the rice had a horrible flavor and was not good. The gravy on the meat was good. I can't understand any place making sweet tea with tap water. Not good. Leaves that tap water flavor.

The owner is from inglewood which was pretty cool(I'm from inglewood too lol)We sat down with a party of 4 and got our food pretty quick. The staff was friendly the a/c was going (which is important I mean we are in Vegas) and the TV and music were entertaining and up to date! The pricing is the same as any other fast food place to me so that's not a problem. And lastly the food was really good and I got full I saw complaints about the serving size but I had no problem with it. The staff also checked up with up often which I like because sometimes I'm pretty needy ahaha but not too often to where I'm annoyed. But anyways I'll be back for sure they have my vote.",

Pleased to see another cuisine is taking a chance at this location.  walk in to order some food to go.  Place is blasting music which might annoy some but was fine with me.  Disappointed to read it will take at least 20 minutes if any fried food is ordered - i was kinda in da mood for fried Chicken ... next time.  I purposely look for menu items that i figure are easily prepared since i have limited time.  I opt for the meatloaf and the smoked sausage lunch plates.  Sadly, it still took over 20 minutes to get my food.  I loved the sausage, the meatloaf ...ehhh.  For the life of me, i can't figure out why it took so long for the food.  there was ony one other customer and the meatloaf is pre-cooked.  The staff were very nice and i sense this place has potential but the food i opted for was average.  I will definitely try again ( call in the fried chicken order ) and i'm hoping this place lasts longer than the prior occupants.",

Washed it down with the sweet tea (which wasn't overpoweringly sweet but decent). Roommate had the liver & onions this time (overcooked & dry) but she had had the fried chicken & fried catfish before and really enjoyed it. Service was efficient and very friendly.

    "text": "Was so looking forward to having a home style country soul food dinner with my husband on a Saturday night....And was so extremely disappointed to the utmost!  1st off it took over an hour to serve 2 waffles and 4 pieces of chicken, one piece was sitting in the fry basket for a good 20 minutes, we had a birds eye view of the kitchen from our table so was able to see all of what was going on or shall I say wasn't going on!  There had to be over 5 people in that kitchen and 1 guy doing the cooking and nothing else was going on beside smack talking with each other and talking on their cell phones.   I ordered the mac and cheese I couldn't even eat it, it was the worst I have ever tasted in my life, NO flavoring at all didn't even taste like there was cheese in it and the noodles were extremely over cooked.    Back to the chicken for just a moment OMG the driest piece of meat I've ever had next to beef jerky and even that has more tenderness in it cause it marinates, there was NO seasoning what so ever and clearly over fried for sure....I had to douse it with the waffle syrup just to get it down....Okay now about the so called waffles...the thinnest piece of waffle I have ever seen I thought it was a crape with scores to look like a waffle it was so thin, they doused it with butter to camouflage the dryness in that as well.  Makes me want to slap my momma is right for ever going there and expecting that it was going to be better then my mommas!!!",

The cornbread pancake appetizer was impeccable and I could've kept eating them, which made my mouth water for my food coming next! Well, here's the twist: I ordered meatloaf, Mac n cheese, yams and red beans n rice! Yeah! Sounds good, don't it?! Ummm hmmm, that's what I thought too! Meatloaf: Beef...no onions, no bell peppers or anything! Just a thick slide of dry beef with Very salty gravy on top! Nooooo!!! Yams: sweet and good Mac n cheese: OK, not as cheesy as I would like, but still good. Red beans n rice: No, no, no. No real flavor, rice was a little over cooked.  Oh yeah, I forgot the Sweet potato pie: it was a tart sized pie, nothing to write home about. I will give this place another try, cause it definitely have potential! I will try something else next go round...",

Went with my mom for breakfast, her waffle was wayyyyy tooooo salty and my waffle tasted like the only ingredient in it was apple sauce. Weird. Maybe the chef did not mix the waffle batter right. I will definitely be back for the chicken. However, If I want chicken and waffles I'm heading to Roscoes in California",

Anyways, finding this place is just around the corner for us is really awesome.  The first time I came here I got the liver and onions and it's just amazing!!! For the price it's great.  The gravy was amazing topped with carmelized onions and the flavor was just so intense.  The cabbage and the yams were to die for and I really love the fried okra.  My first visit they even added a couple of  cornbread.  It's not like the dried out cornbread you get from Boston market but awesome pancake like cornbread that is amazing.  Will definitely go there again.",

The kitchen is messy, the food quality presentation is sub par, and overall it's WAY OVERPRICED. The ribs were mediocre at best and all side dishes seem to come out of a can and not freshly made.  I would recommend all that haven't tried this place that have been debating to PASS, you are not missing a thing. There is WAY better quality food out there for less expensive.   Unfortunately I will not be returning. Best of Las Vegas definitely has this place all wrong.",
