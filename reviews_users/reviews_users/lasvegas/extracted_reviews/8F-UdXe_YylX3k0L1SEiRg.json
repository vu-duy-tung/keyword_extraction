It was freezing outside, so I ordered the chicken porridge with fried chinese donuts and a soy milk.  It tasted fine while I ate it and I was feeling fine after I finished.   About an hour later after I got back to my hotel room, all hell broke loose in my bowel system and I was in the shitter for quite some time.  It reminded me of the scene from the movie \"Van Wilder\" where the dude had to just take a dump right there and then.  We're talking montezuma revenge of some sort and possibly a colon cleansing experience.  My eyes rolled back and I just dropped huge bombs into that poor porcelain stall. Needless to say, it must've been the food that I ate from here!  I would not eat here right before you go skydiving if you get my drift?!",

It seems like everyone is judging off the Pho, which is good IMO, but try the rice dishes, those are really good.  I get them because they're the same price as the Pho, and Pho doesn't fill me up like rice does.  I brought my friends here and every time they go to Vegas they want this spot.  Overall, this is a good place.",

The food is extremely fast which is a good thing, but the food isn't the best I've had. It's still pretty good, but I'm definitely down to try another Vietnamese restaurant next time. However, it is way better than paying $14 for eggs and bacon in your hotel.",

Summer rolls lacked any mint, the veggie sides were only some bean sprouts, sad looking basil and a few slices of jalepeno.  But then we were in the middle of the desert not SoCal or Hawaii.  The broth was ok and overall just ok.",

The broth is actually rather flavorful, but the ingredients they give you to put in the pho were not as good as I'd hoped.  The basil was a little wilted, the greens weren't very aromatic, and the beef was tough.  The spring rolls were pretty standard, but definitely worth ordering, and the roasted chicken was pretty good, too.    Nothing at Pho Little Saigon was extremely impressive, but it was good enough to come back, especially if it's open 24 hours.  If you want the best Pho in town, this is not where to go.  But if you wake up in the middle of the night with a huge craving for Pho, this place will definitely more than satisfy your hunger.",

The last time I went there my bowl of Pho was nearly perfect.  Usually when I go to other places there is more noodles than beef or vice versa or the beef has lots of fat on it.  When I go here the beef and noodles are proportionate and there is no fat on the beef.  This place also seems pretty popular too.  Each time I go there at night there's always a good crowd.  They serve more than Pho at this place too and the servings are a nice size.  I ordered the BBQ Pork here a few times and it was really good.  The only cons I can think of this place are sometimes they might bring you an appetizer while you are eating your main dish.  Last time I went there nobody was at the door to seat me; I had to walk to the counter to get service.  On the menus it looked like they raised the price and parts of the menu were covered in white out and they just wrote the new price over the white out instead of just printing new menus.    It's cash only but several other Asian restaurants are too so that's not a big deal to me.",

Besides the food of death they have some serious shady buisness practices.  I ordered drinks with my meal but they never came.  The waiter won't bring you a check at the end of the meal, you have to go up to the front and tell them what table you were at, and even then they don't give an itemized bill.  I wanted coffee so I asked for some to go, they did make it but bringing it out I got an eye roll that went so far back into the guys head he could have fallen down.  Thinking about what I ordered and what I recieved I know I paid for the drinks I didn't get and I think the waiter even tipped himself.  NO just NO.  Do not eat here it's not worth it!",

I ordered a Pho Dac Biet and it costed about 10$ which is expensive for a bowl of pho, which usually ranges from 5-6 dollars, and to me 7-8 dollars already seems expensive. For four egg rolls here it cost $5.99, and they were delicious but not worth the price. I'd say I've had better egg rolls at other areas nearby the Sacramento area. My pho was alright, it wasn't hecka good but it wasn't nasty. Their customer service is pretty good, the man that owns the shop I believe was nice and likes to make jokes. :)",

Clean restaurant, no problems with the crowds and parking at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Good fried egg rolls and Pho Tam Nam Bo Vien (pho with the beef and beef balls). Friendly staff, good boba. Big bowls for about $7.50-$8.00. Perfect for when you're done with all that buffet and Vegas strip food.   Open 24 hours..",

Anyway, so my family wanted to eat pho before heading back to Cali and it took us 45 minutes for our food to come out! After asking them about it twice or so! First, we thought it took a while because they were busy, but nope, the waiter never put in our order or lost it or whatever. We were about to walk out! Obviously they saw us sitting there waiting but never did they went and check to see what was going on or at least ask us again if someone took our order yet. There was a table behind us that came after us and ate & left and we still didn't get our food! Their pho was very bland and the meats were really weird tasting and weird looking! Even though they have a variety of different dishes here, I will not be coming back. I would recommend going somewhere else down the spring mountain street!",

I wasn't much a fan of the service but the stir fried low mein is hands down the best I've had so far. So I keep going back to this place regardless of how mediocre the service were. I've figured I can overlooked that service part, since it's not that bad.     Tonight at 8:25pm I decided to go in. They were slow. 3 tables were occupied. A guy who seated me was already annoyed that I was there. He was on the phone while seating me.     I went and ordered my usual. I just told him what I wanted since I already know what I wanted.     He kept asking me to look for the number on the menu. He then was irritated when I asked him for a Pepsi. The entire evening of service was like, I was being treated like shit. Around an hr and half of me being there, never once I was approached to ask if I'm still alive or choking with something. I still went ahead and just kept eating.     By the time I decided I am done and I still have half of my low mein left on my plate, I was waving at anybody that would pass by my table to get my ticket and a to go box. Two men were working that night. I seem to be invisible. Then finally, one guy approached me, I asked for a to go plate, and he pointed out the direction of the door and said something \" there\" and walked away.     Again, patiently enough, I waited for someone to come to my table again. Nobody came. So I stood up and asked one of the other guy who was taking orders, and he then again told me \" there the to go plate\". I guess, I was supposed to get my own to go box, located right next to the entrance door. By this time, I've had enough. So I said \" ok can I get a check..\". The first guy I asked for a to go box, went to the cash register and rang me up, I gave him my card and asked for his name. He said his name is \" Johnny\". I doubt if that's even his real name,     I said \" you guys are rude, I said what kind of service is this.. I waved at you multiple times you were ignoring me\" - as I signed the receipt marking \" no tip\". He said \" one person works inside the kitchen so we're short\". So I asked him \" who's that owner what is his/her name?\".     He goes \" You dont' need to know her name\". I said I come here almost 3 times a week in the morning and I'm a regular you should be nicer to the customers\". And He said yelling \" go in the morning!\".     That was that and I left. That would be the last time I go to this place. Being short handed was not an excuse for being rude to the customer. He could have been apologetic and that would have been fine with me.",

It looked promising from the outside and had a very visible 24 hour open sign. We told ourselves we were feeling adventurous anyway.   Looking back, I wish we turned around and never looked back. I always stress how I personally try to refrain from harsh criticism on my first visit but the impression a restaurant makes is not entirely due to circumstances. And I'm talking hygiene. Sure, assuming it was late at night, they might have been understaffed but those bathrooms were pretty filthy. Too bad we already ordered.  The food was OK. I couldn't say it made up for the sight in the bathrooms. Broth was not as tasteful as other Pho places I've tried. The egg rolls were just fine. Prices were quite high though and I understand they to make up for the energy and labor used during the night shifts. Then again, nothing delivered. The waiters looked groggy and unwilling to take further requests. Glad to have experienced it already and not need to go back.",

Same thing happened the second time. The fish was still half frozen.   Ca kho t (stewed fish) was poorly made. The fish should be stewed to where the the sauce and seasonings should be absorbed for flavor but when it came out it was bland.   Stir fry garlic spinach was terrible. Leaves/stalks were long and tough to chew. 3D spinach = dai, dai & d (tough, long, & bad)  Many more dishes were ordered all equally as bad. I think this place only survives by trapping innocent hungry people late in the night.",

Needless to say I sent it back and it was taken off the bill.   Also, none of the workers seem to speak English there, and were not very friendly when they did not understand what you we're trying to order.  Only reason why I gave this place a one star is because it's open 24 hours. I mean how many pho joints do you know that offer that?

Wait\". Instead of coming back to take our order, he is cleaning up the table and serving other table. In about 7min, (after I saw him finished serving and cleaning the table) I am caliing him again, this time he didn't even respon and he just ignored our table. Surprisingly, the other person was standing at the cashier he just watching me while I am trying to look for someone who can take the order. Then i tried to understand maybe they are not the person who usually talking to customer. So i am waiting the 1st person who told me to wait and the same person who ignored us. Again, he is passing by our table and I am calling him to let him now that we are ready to order. He is only looking at me, raise his hand to me and keep walking. I dont know what is that suppose to mean? Well.,. Purposely, i call the man who standing at the cashier and he just staring at me without doing anything... I called again and Finally, he is get out from his 'comfort' area.. Comes to our table and took the order. But, the way he talk and his attitude was very rude! I can't accept his rudeness and attitude. I told my husband to order. I am really mad and tired with thier ignoranc already.! So I choose to keep quite. If i am not coming with my guests, i'd rather to get out from this place. It seems that this place didnt need customer. It's really Horrible service and attitude! We ordered total of 10 dish for 6people. All 10 of Their foods are bad! None of my guests were satisfied thier choices.  If there is a scale from 0-ZERO, i will rate them definitely 0-ZERO!!!  Since the lowest in this survey is 1..... Then I think i am so generous to give 1- since it has no Zero option available.... So i choice to rate 1.   Definitely we wont come back! Ever!!!! So bad!

I was left a bit unsatisfied, mainly because of the service.  Pho LIttle Saigon is a large pho restaurant nestled in Vietnamese town. We all had pho in our group and only one person wasn't happy with how the pho was. The pho, in my opinion, had enough flavor for it to be a little above average. What I wasn't happy about was the service. They just weren't very accommodating, nor friendly. No greeting, no smile, no warm fuzzy feeling inside. To add insult to injury, the server spilled water all over my friend and ALMOST his iphone. Forget my friend... save the iPhone! I understand servers don't run around intentionally spilling water on customers (I THINK), but he didn't even apologize.  Whatever.

However, what did surprise me was that a 24 hours pho place existed.  It seemed like an amazing novel idea whilst in my drunken stupor. It didn't quite sink in that we were in Vegas and everything is always open.  As we walked to grab a taxi....I meowed like a cat at a guy walking by. I still don't know wtf I was thinking. He said something like, \"hey there kitty\" or something. I got freaked out and quickly hobbled away in pain. Damn you, stilettos! I never thought my pseudo pick up line would be successful =[  When we finally got a taxi, I got shot gun and quickly discovered that our taxi driver was high....I could just tell! But he got us there safely so that's all that matters.  Once we were there and sat down, the waiter kept ignoring us even though the place was super empty. I ordered pho and a thai tea boba. The tapioca sucked. The consistency was really hard to chew and swallow. The pho was okay, nothing special but price wise...it was on the expensive side. Ah, Vegas prices.  I dropped my money plus tip and peaced out early. As I hobbled away slowly, in excruciating pain from my damn shoes in order to hail a taxi....I mused: Um, did we really have to come all the way to Vegas to go to the Asian part of town???  At least I was called a \"hot betch\" by some chick driving by in a taxi and \"hot\" by some random dude back at the hotel. It made the pain I was experiencing a tad less severe.",

While you don't need any lube to throw a hot dog down a hallway (if you know what I mean), there was enough of an oily broth in my pho that could make even Obama whince.  I was jacked by whoever filled my bowl by skimming the top of the pho broth - where all the oil floats.  Doesn't \"Pho-Making 101\" include oil reduction? Even British Petroleum probaby couldn't have done a better job.    The pho also averages $6-$7, so don't be surprised that for a party of five (5) and some appetizers, you end up with an $80 bill.

    "text": "Holy crap the line at Palazzo to get a taxi is LONG. Damn.  Let's walk over to Treasure Island and get a cab from there. Oh wait, taxi cab waiting at light to make a turn onto the strip... Heyyyy, can we get in? Sure. Crap, only 4 of us can fit.  What the hell just happened?  Where to? Pho Little Saigon, on Spring Mtn Rd. Banessa in the front seat.  WTF? This guy sounds like he's high/stoned.  Oh we weren't supposed to get into a cab that's waiting at a light. Where's the rest of our party?  We arrived at PLS and ordered and waited for the rest to show up. $7 for Pho...I'm not hungry, it's 3AM!  Everyone else shows up. Omg, the pho was HOT. Who knew I couldn't use chopsticks when inebriated. You know what happens when you wear a short dress, it becomes shorter when you sit down = disaster. I was trying to move the bowl closer to me and the broth spilled out and onto my leg, O_O omg. /scoops ice out of water and rubs it on my leg. what the eff?  Pho was less than mediocre. Eggrolls were BURNT.  Didn't you order spring rolls? They gave you eggrolls. Two guys left and decided to pay separate, I guess we're not allowed to do that.  Vietnamese waiter says something. Birthday boy says 'what?' $81?! Why isn't my order on the bill... We're drunk we can't do correct math. Everyone leaves.  Okay, there's six of us...how are we going to get a cab. Damn taxi drivers, would pull up see that were too many of us and speed away. Lol, what do we do...limo pulls up, $45 to take us back to TI...yea no thanks. omg....wave down that shuttle... guy pulls into the parking lot, how much to take us to treasure island? $20 SOLD! (which would have been equivalent to taking two cabs) The guy had just started his shift and was happy to bring us back to our hotel. Excellent.  Good times.",

    "text": "Originally set to go some place else, my aunt and company wound up here due to driving miscommunications LOL. Had I known they wanted Pho, I could've checked Yelp and laid options on the table. When I got the text of the meeting place I immediately looked it up and was flabbergasted when I saw the low 2.5 stars. Oh well, I vowed to be more adventurous this year didn't I?  When I got there it was packed! Hmmm so maybe this place isn't so bad after all? My family had already ordered and was half way thru their meal when I sat down, they said the service was really fast so they waited to put in my order until I got there so my food wouldn't get cold. So why the 2 star review?   I first ordered egg rolls, it was delivered less than 5 minutes I kid you not. Wooah that was lightning fast! It was hot, crisp and a little well done. Standard egg roll taste, it did its job. I opted to get the rare beef pho for myself and the grilled pork chop for my son. The pork chop had great taste but it could've used a couple more minutes on the grill, very little charring or burnt edges which I like. That was the extent of my favorable experience as immediately after that everything went downhill. They took at least 30 minutes to finally deliver my soup, we've had to ask them several times. We knew it either had to be forgotten or missed cause my aunt said they got their soup delivered within 10 minutes. The Thai tea took about 5 or 6 requests before it got to my hands and the vegetables for the Pho was another mishap. Now I do understand things could be skipped cause it was seriously a mad house in there but no one could give an explanation on what was happening and definitely no apologies were offered. All they kept telling us was \"it's coming\" yet everyone around me that came after was already served.   All in all the food wasn't bad, honestly I expected worst due to the low ratings but I don't see myself coming back at all. There are so many great Pho places in town, why would you settle for less. There's just way too much things going on here that most times things get missed or forgotten. Just by observing the employees, it didn't look like they had a system in place, it was pure chaos. Also, we were informed by a family member how nasty the bathroom was, I didn't want to imagine how the kitchen must be, away from the scrutinizing eyes of the patrons *shudders*",

The only thing that is available is pho... this didn't really bother me much because the place is name pho anyways... so I wasn't going to order something else. It's just the False advertising that got me heated...  THIS is really the part that pushed me over the cliff... We were charged for egg noodles and various other dishes that WEREN'T EVEN AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE! FUCKING UNREAL! At least try to make it believable! The menu also clearly said there are TWO sizes... one at 7.99 and the other at 8.99 AND YET we were charged $10 per bowl PLUS an extra $1.50 for fish balls which wasn't even stated!!! WHAT THE FUCKERY!!   We obviously brought it up to their attention. At which point the guy at the register said that everything is the same price so he can charge us with anything as long as it equals the same amount of dishes ordered... We ended up arguing with them for like 15 mins.... nothing got resolved. So I just paid the fee and left because I'm on vacation and I'm not going to be bothered over this fuckery...   Best believe I will NEVER be back again!",

Aside from that, the service was non existent, despite the fact that we were the only customers in there on a Friday night. When I asked if I could swap vegetable for noodles, or simply order a side dish of vegetables (i was willing to pay extra for this) they insisted I could ONLY order a number from the menu exactly as it was listed.   Ambience was also nonexistent. No music, no TV. However, our waiter sat a few table away from us and repeatedly watched a video on his phone with a chicken squawking loudly. So if you count that as ambience, it's got that going for it.  The final nail in the coffin was the food itself - disgusting. I ended up ordering vegetable pho, and they somehow screwed that up. The veggies themselves weren't cooked, and the menu stated it was vegetable with no noodles - yet my dish had noodles in it. My friend ordered shrimp pho, they brought her mixed seafood pho instead, and it was so disgusting she lost her appetite for the rest of the night.   We left without even eating our meals. There are many other restaurants nearby - do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.",

Egg rolls were good, and the highlight of the meal.  For good measure, they overcharged us on the bill.  Many pho places don't itemize, so you simply trust them.  I did, and lost.

They tried to clean the tables for us as quickly as possible and when we finally were seated we were not given menus until ten minutes into just sitting there trying to figure out what to eat.   We all ordered and it did not take long for the food to come out which was surprising. Our family ordered a lot of food and I got to try a little bit of everything. I got the pho dac biet and it was not the best pho I have tried. It was missing flavor to it and on top of that the silverware was not clean, so we cleaned it our selves. Most of the food did not taste like it was freshly made. The spring rolls tasted as if they pre made it and it was sitting in the fridge for a bit. The pho base was not good in my opinion because it really lacked flavor. Some other main dishes like some beef rice dishes tasted pretty good.   Overall this place gets a 2 and a half because the cleanliness of the place was not there forte, the customer service was a bit rude and did not check on us. For a pho place you would expect the pho to be good, but it's not. I recommend coming here for some other dishes and NOT the pho.",

    "text": "So I came here the other night. I know- bad idea to dine at China Town during the weekend after Christmas and before New Year. The entire area was packed and our originally choice Pho Kim Long had a 12 names before us wait. I am very level headed person so I tried to keep that in mind in rating this place but what I experienced was just.. Disappointing.  So the pho was good IMO. We all got the house special pho dac biet. My comparison pho is PhoKim Long and I thought the broth was better and it had more meat. So I did think the food was good.  So we come in and I know what to expect at most establishments in the China Town area: the service is spotty and it can come off as rude.  This was like the worst experience I had dining somewhere.  So we walk in and a man simply asks how many and we say three and he starts to seat us. Out of no where this other man who was bussing starts yelling at the man seating us and makes these wild hand gestures i.e. Making an \"x\" with his arms and shaking his head. It is hard to put into words what happened but it was not welcoming at all. Apparently the guy was trying to tell his coworker they only have soup, the pho dac biet. No other food items. No sandwiches or any entrees or appetizers. That's what we came for anyways so he could have spared us the theatrics.  I have no idea why it took them ten minutes to come back to take our order. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE THING AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT! I was about to leave after thinking about the rude seating situation but the guy comes to take our order. We are told they have the other soups also. No worries! We all wanted what they told us they had anyways. So we wait for soup. Two other tables are seated by us while we wait. They are also told in a not as rude way that they only have soup. They all get the same soup as us.   So I'm never one to bring up the race card but we didn't appreciate that the 3 gentlemen seated 10 minutes after us some how get their soup before us. My table of 3 didn't speak their language. My table of three which consisted of my Mexican best friend, and my half black cousin, and myself. We get ours a few minutes later. I tried to think no.. Maybe they ordered something else... But the guy who seated them spoke a language other than English to them (which is how I know they spoke the same language) and the rude busser guy took their order but told them they only had one size of the house special dac biet pho. So I know 100% that we got the same thing and they were seated after us and got their food first.   Needless to say we didn't leave a great tip but we did leave a decent one even considering the experience.   I didn't one star the place because the other guys were okay and I surprisingly liked their pho.  I looked back at when we came in and wish we left. I'm not one to complain. I feel like if you are able to control the situation by leaving then you should. We just really wanted pho!   The whole thing just made me sad. Maybe that guy was having a crappy day but he was constantly yelling across the restaurant, constantly frowning, and just being rude to his coworkers and his patrons. He should have went home. Many people chose not to be seated once being informed of the only soup. The owners should really check out the reviews left by everyone.",

Helpful, I'll say.  I like that they used pork belly meat along with shrimp in the traditional spring rolls. The Bun Bo Hue I ordered was made right, perfectly seasoned. I ordered Chinese donuts on the side since my boyfriend ordered Pho n could eat that with the soup as well. My BF had the Viet coffee which was good and I had a fresh coconut, cold n refreshing.   Pretty good meal, held us all the way to Santa Barbara.",

The menu also says that there is a \"regular\" and \"small\" size for phos and the waiter told us that they are only serving the large which was nothing like a large. What really made me thinking of never coming back was the HORRIBLE service and attitude. The Vietnamese waiter and male cashier gave me the worst attitude for no reason.

With the pen and pad in his hands we get the signal he's ready to take our order now. When we ask for the small and large bowl of pho. He told us large is not on the menu and it's $2 charge. When. It clearly shows on the menu the price is less than what he mention. Well that was annoying at that point. Told him that False advertisement and he should label the menu correctly so we exactly what to order and what the prices are. He didn't say anything at all and just walk away. How RUDE!!!! Is all I can say. To be honest we weren't even complexly done with our order. But we were hungry so we settle with the 2 bowls and did not order drinks since he decided to just walk away. What we should of done is walk away from him too.   The worse customer service I've experienced.",

    "text": "I'm new to the pho scene but I've been to China Town before and like the energy and vibe there.  I visited this restaurant with a friend for a late lunch today (Saturday) when the place was almost empty.  This restaurant has a casual vibe and is open 24 hours a day. I actually liked the decor- it has a natural look, with wood chairs and large wooden blinds in a cafeteria-like open space. I liked the fresh and clean look  - no old, dirty worn out rugs and dusty plastic plants like some restaurants have.  The servers were relaxed and friendly, and brought the food promptly.  Speed and convenience seem to be the words for this place. I liked the stacks of spoons and small bowls and the container of chopsticks on each table- no need to ask for anything. They bring a stack of paper napkins and you're pretty much good to go.  There are at least 5 different sauces available at the table, from sweet hoisin to killer-hot sriracha.   Before my seafood pho arrived, the server placed on the table a large plate of bean sprouts topped with branches of thai basil leaves- I thought it looked pretty cool.  The pho bowl was HUGE- impossible to eat in one sitting!  I enjoyed it, (gotta say, those squid pieces I could have done without- but that's a personal problem).  We pulled leaves off the branches to put into the pho and happily slurped as much pho as we could eat before a personable server offered to pack up the rest for us to take home.  He agreed that the huge bowls of pho were too much for one sitting, but a great deal budget- wise. I paid $11 for an appetizer and the pho and have enough pho for one or two more meals. I should warn, however, that the noodles get soft and mushy in a few hours. Maybe you should take them out of the broth  if you aren't going to eat your leftovers for a few hours. Just an idea.  So, not a fancy place, but very inviting with decent food. I'd come back and I'd bring friends.",

Unfortunately, that was not the case in this experience. I would say the food was decent, but not memorable. But the food isn't the reason I am giving this restaurant only one star...  My boyfriend is a fluent vietnamese speaker, but when he is with me, he speaks english. When we were finished we paid the bill, but the man at the register didn't give us any receipt. Since he was in Vegas for a work trip, he needs the receipts for reimbursement. All in all, the man at the register got angry and started talking crap about us in Vietnamese... He was very rude and deliberately took his time to give it to us. My bf kept his cool and went up to explain why he needed the receipt in Vietnamese, and the owner turned beet red because he didn't think he was able to understand him.   All in all, we will NEVER come back. I hope the owner learned his lesson to not talk smack in front of his customers.",

My husband started to order and he was trying to get the order straight in his mind because he didn't want to mess up my dad's order(he's on a special diet because he's diabetic). The guy got annoyed said we weren't ready rolled his eyes and left to help someone paying at the register. We were shocked that he just left. He finally came back and took our order with attitude. My husband was so upset and wanted to leave telling his mom that he shouldn't talk to customer's that way but she talked him into staying. A long time later our food finally came(except for mine...I didn't want to ask for it because I didn't want them to spit in it). My mom got her food and she was supposed to have Noodles but there was none. We didn't say anything, my mom still ate it. The guy was passing around the pho and asking who had the one he was holding while he stood right beside my mother in law. She said, \"right here.\" And he continued to ask with attitude. Wrong thing to do w/my mother in law. She slammed her chopsticks down and yelled at him, \"right here!\" Then she proceeded to yell at him about how her son wanted to leave but she talked him to staying and why does he have to talk to us that way. The whole table couldn't even enjoy their food. And I just watched everyone else eat because remember I never got my order. If I could give this place no stars I would. My hubby was still angry hours later and it's just sad that someone can ruin your whole day like that. I would NEVER come here again!",

My friend kindly asked for sweet and sour sauce, the server rudely said \"NO!\" Also, it was the first time I ordered the egg roll & rice vermicelli, the server did not warn me that there are peanuts & I'm allergic to peanuts. Do they not know how common peanut allergies are!! They should've at least listed \"nuts\" in the food description. It's not the first time I've been here & I've never gotten poor customer service here. I'm surprised they don't check on their customers if they need anything else. Not once did I see any of the servers come up to us to see if everything was ok. I waited so long to get a refill on my drink. We seriously wasted our money here! We came for the rare steak pho but they were all crossed out so we had to pick out the crappy food they sold instead. Should've took the crossed out pho as a warning!! I wasn't going to rate them but I finally got my refill I give them 1 star only!",

I had previously never been to any Vietnamese food places in Las Vegas but had frequented a place called BoBo's in Sacramento because they had killer BBQ Pork over rice noodles and spring rolls.   Guess what was on the menu..... Yep, you guessed it, BBQ Pork. So after ordering the food we waited for it to arrive and sure enough it was fresh and as if we ordered it in the restaraunt; How you ask , well thats simple, someone in this world finally decided that by packaging everything seperate in seperate containers and just letting the person put it together themselves the food is that much more fresh. 2 thumbs up for that idea.   All of the food was spot on and tasted great, from the BBQ Pork to the Pho. There was nothing on our table that afternoon that was not up to standards.",

I don't know what's worse but the fact the cockroach was in the pho or the fact that everyone got the same thing and it was the same broth? I guess thanks for the free food?

Bathrooms are dirty tables are as well and the meat in the soup was so chewy it could have been called a beef gum soup. Will not be returning to this place. At this point I didn't slap someone in the face after they whispered and mumbled whatever they said simply because my children were present. Don't come to this place. Oh and don't think you can order drinks because they won't serve them until food is ordered. And bring a few lemons in your pocket because they're running low",

When we first got it, the server ran out & sat us down in a minute. But then took 10 minutes to take the order.           Then they threw the food & drinks to our tables as we were beggars for food! We ordered:  - Pho combo, - Rare beef Pho, - Hu Tieu - Rice stick noodle soup with seafood, - Egg Noodle with roasted pork, dry style, - & Fried rice             All noodle soup was $8 per bowl & nothing tasted good. I would thought after 8 hours drive, even rock would taste good!             Pros: This place opened 24 hours!             Cons: Cash only & everything else!",

    "text": "This is the first pho place I tried in vegas, and up until this past weekend, I thought of it kind of as that trusty down jacket that you wear in the winters - it keeps you warm and serves its purpose, but you don't exactly feel sexy in it.  After this weekend, however, that all changed.  In a nutshell, I had the most delicious freakin' broth of my LIFE.  It was SO GOOD, and I've had plently of good pho places, being from la, and having gone to school in norcal.  The broth was just incredible - we were still raving about it hours after the meal.  Here are a few other things I like about this place (other than the awesome pho soup of course):  1. Their summer rolls are just the right amount of chewiness, and have a spring of mint, which gives them a nice freshness.  2. They have a huge menu (including some more traditional chinese items), and many of the items have corresponding pictures, which helps when you're trying to decide what to order.  3. They have a pho soup that's just rare steak and tripe, which is my favorite combo.  4.  There's never a wait and they always refill your water without your having to ask.  Here are a few not so great things:  1.  The food is a bit inconsistent - as I said, we've been here a few times, and while it was never BAD, it was not really always so GOOD.  So it's a bit of a gamble walking into this place.  2.  It's cash only.  Overall, I'd say that this place is pretty darn decent, and occasionally mind blowingly freakin' awesome.",

    "text": "NOTE: I'm only reviewing this place based on what I heard and experienced. I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I do have an AWESOME story to tell...  You know wassup..after the club..where do you usually hit up?! The spot that's open 24 hours or hella late. In San Diego, it's usually Denny's for me. I have many memories from there (good and bad), but mostly good. =)  In Vegas...it was \"Pho Little Saigon\" for us! Now..I have been to establishments for pho post-clubbing and it is always PACKED full of asians. We sure love our pho! Usually, it is the go-to spot to sober up and grab some good eats, even though everything does taste good under the influence of alchy.  Half drunk and feet in major pain from the shitty heels that I wore, I dashed to use the restroom while everyone was seating. Again, this place was practically empty and wow so was the restroom. Very rare for a female. Oh! Joy! I get to pick my own stall! The BIG one! I do my bizz and I noticed the cool electronic hand towel machine. Wait..no paper towels are coming out. This is automatic and sensored?! Is it broken?! Oh wait..a light on the bottom right was visible so I do a circular wave and WABAAM...paper towels pop out! Woohoo! Pretty awesome feeling when you're typsy!  Next thing you know another girl (from the club I assumed) walks in slightly typsy as well and was about to get paper towels and I noticed she was having a difficult time getting the paper towels to come out.  Feeling like an \"expert\" by now, I showed her how to operate the machine and in amazement she was pretty impressed that I was able to figure it out and she couldn't. She kinda felt dumb. haha   So..my head was kinda getting slightly big at this moment and we both were about to depart the restroom and as I was exiting I went straight out the door into the MENS RESTROOM!! Well..ALMOST! Oh man! I stopped just in the knick of time and she looks at me and we both laugh uncontrollably! I didn't feel so smart anymore and she didn't feel so dumb. =/  Head over to where my group was and told my little story and all were amused or from what I recall at least. Wasn't slightly hungry since I ate prior to clubbing, which wasn't very long since I couldn't groove much to the music due to my CRAPTASTIC shoes! Ugh! Anywhoo, I noticed poor Melly Su was somewhat enjoying her soup until she accidentally spilled it on her legs..SUPER HOT..like boiling HOT! I only touched the bowl, and it was waaay toooo HOT!! No bueno. I think that may have woke/sobered her up though!  What the PHO?! I know. These pho jokes are getting old, but I had to slip one in there. It's kinda like tradition. Anywhoo...No mmm's or ahhhh's from the group of friends so I thought maybe it was just A-OK.   Soup is just soup sometimes. Oh ya..I also recall Melly Su telling my pal, \"Chris-Chan\" to eat her burnt eggroll. haha! It seriously was beyond burnt! As typsy as I was..I even knew it wouldn't taste good. Who you foolin' \"Little Saigon\" ??? GHETTOO!!  The End.  **Okay..so maybe not an AWESOME story. Maybe it would sound better under the influence??? Oh well..still worthy of a review right?! hehe",

After a night of gambling and drinking, my group needed a little detox session. This place did just that. I was actually kind of mad that we went here at 6am because I just wanted to sleep, but glad we did afterward because it was pretty delicious. Not sure what I ordered, beef slices probably because I usually skip the organ cuts. Can't comment on the other dishes, but maybe next time I'll try them.",

I was excited that this place was open 24hr! The pho was really good for it being a 24 hr joint and at good prices. I love pho because it's a comfort food, especially that I was sick. Being sick + pho = no congestion!  The only complaint I have was that my bf and I were wondering if they only accepted cash because they has a cash only sign though they do accept credit/debit.  The service was really friendly and fast, perhaps because we were in by 12:30 AM :D.",

    "text": "This has always been the go-to place for me and my family every time we come to Vegas. We've always liked this place, but now, we're not so sure anymore.   The food here has been good and we've always preferred the food here compared to Pho Kim Long in the next plaza. But now we're unsure about returning because of our recent experience with the service.  We came here with a rather large party over Labor Day Weekend. We sat down, and 10-15 minutes goes by as no one came by to take our order. We had to raise our hand to get one of the server's attention to come over. When the server came over to take our order, he was very rude. Any special requests we had, he would be like \"we don't have that here\" in the meanest tone. He wasn't happy nor was he trying to be. He took our orders and picked up the menus from our table with the biggest attitude. 20 minutes goes by as we began to wonder where's our food. Granted it was somewhat busy, but man, still. As a matter of fact, that was when one of the other servers came by and was like \"did someone take your orders already?\" Dude, if we waited that long for YOU to notice us to take our order, you might as well would have lost us as customers already. Anyway, our food started to come out one by one as the last 3 dishes came out long after everyone got their food. I was not amused with the way they were delivering us our food. They brought out a wrong order and handled it very unprofessionally. They came out with the dish and announced \"com ga.\" We responded and said \"no one from our table got com ga.\" That server then got frustrated and YELLED across the restaurant and asked \"who took the orders for this table?!\" then went on and passed it off to that server. I didn't appreciate the yelling nor the frustration. That server then came by, picked up the dish, asked the same question, and got frustrated and left. We thought maybe they got the wrong table and that my mom's dish was still on the way. 5 minutes goes by, my mom's food was still missing. At this point, we tagged down another server and said \"excuse us, we're still missing a com thit nuong.\" That server then went to the back and took care of that order. My mom's food came out when everyone was literally almost done with their food. At this point, I would have at least expected them to say \"sorry for the trouble\" and done something about it. But nope. My dad then noticed that no one received soup with their rice (cause a bowl of soup normally comes with the rice) and asked our original server about it. The server responded with \"we don't serve a bowl of soup with rice here.\" My internal response was literally \"What?? You don't?? You always have before.\" At this point, I felt like he didn't really care or bother cause well, it didn't seem like he really cared or bothered in the first place. Or at least he would have either tried to explain or at least tried to make it work, right?  My family and I normally come here and this time, we brought more family with us. But obviously the experience was so unpleasant that we will now probably think twice before returning again. Fix your service. It matters.",

We ordered the wings 5 minutes after we got our food and they expect us to take them when were already done eating. Unacceptable. My friend rice was ridiculously salty and my passionfruit juice? It was literally just syrup.   Overall my experience was horrible. Getting water? I should've gotten it within 5 minutes when I asked. I asked three times before I could get any. The food? Too salty and the drinkS were toooo sweet. In addition to that! My brother was standing on the isle for less than 30 seconds and the old man told him to MOVE and said to my mother that she should keep her kids away the isle. Like it was our fault the isles are only big enough for one person.",

I waited about 12 minutes he passed by me twice then walked out the door. A woman employee comes to the register and says how can I help you? I said I am waiting on the sandwiches to go and she says we are too busy no sandwiches right now. I told her that I placed an order about 15 minutes ago and am just waiting to pay and get the sandwiches. She says no more sandwiches so I said okay. I walk outside and as I am calling the client the guy that took my order notices the hotel sign on car and asked what happened. I told him what happened and he blew me off with he didn't understand my order. I used to love this place but won't ever come back and will recommend other restaurants to our guests instead.",

    "text": "I don't like to be the bearer of bad news for any restaurant but I will say the service here was horrible. I started off by letting the owner they're know that the bathroom was dirty since there was only two stalls and one of them had a freaking turd clogged in the toilet which looked like it was about a foot high! (already grossing out my appetite). Being that I worked 13 hours straight at two different jobs I got there quite tired. When the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat I took a deep breath and was about to give my order but he immediately walked away as though I was taking too long. I finally got my order from another waiter and towards the very end I didn't realize that they only took cash.   Luckily they had a machine back there that took my card so I said \"You'll have to forgive me for being a little spaced out i just worked a 13 hour shift today\" he says with a very strong accent, \"I don't care about the fact that you worked 13 hours I just want my money!\" So with that being said I did not leave a tip. My tip would have been, \"Go to hell and don't let the door hit you on your way out!!\"... by the way, I went back to the restroom to fix my hair and saw the same mass of crap there. I let the owner know and he said that he could not go in there because he was a man but I clearly saw him tell his female worker about the issue earlier and i remember her looking me in the face and giving me dirty look.  Please forgive me for being so candid about it but damn, I'm just keeping it real about my experience and can say that unfortunately I never plan on coming back to this restaurant again...  So much for thinking that I could have found a new 24 hour Pho spot!",

Sadly ?I have lived here a year and  this was my first time trying anywhere in China Town. YES! I know I was really lagging on that one. I moved to Vegas from the Silicon Valley where we had tons and tons of delicious Asian Cuisine especially PHO. Having been a guest at many Vietnamese restaurants I know that good service isn't typically their strong suit. Surprisingly Pho Little Saigon kept my water full and had a friendly server apologizing for any wait I had. Now that was really shocking but I wonder if he didn't over hear me tell my date I had to take photos before we ate any of our food LOL. Regardless it was a Decent experience. Definitely not the BEST ever but the food tasted good and didnt give me a MSG coma. It also was HUGE portions which I obviously can never eat so I wish they offered the option of a smaller size but overall they have good variety and yummy EATS!",

I would definitely try other pho places if you have the chance.",

We didn't want to get it on the strip because we were sure it would be good and that it would be expensive.  We found this place because of all their advertising. Yes that stuff works. When I went inside, I was surprised to see how Americanized it was. That was a bad sign off the bat, plus it was a 24 hour place. =(  I order the house special egg noodles and glass noodles soup and he order a pho tai, the one with just the strips of steak. When I got my bowl, I tasted it and it tasted really bad. I wasn't sure what it was but I couldn't eat very much of it. The glass noodles also really sucked. They were very soft and broke very easily. They were basically mush. I only ate a few bites. My fiance tried his pho and was disappointed as well. I tried the broth and boy was it full of msg. The aftertaste was really bad. It tasted so salty. No wonder he couldn't finish it. I was just so disappointed especially because he was not feeling well and this wasn't helping. We left with very sad looks on our faces. Never again.",

I took my mom,  and she said that the pork fried rice was hands down the best she's had.  As for the demerit situation. .. It was kind of a perfect storm of a situation, with a pipe breaking, and food storage issues because they were in the middle of selling their other location and moving stuff over,  according to the staff we talked to after they re opened.   As often as I've been there,  I've never had the issues that others have spoken of with insects,  etc. The staff is friendly when you engage them. This place is much better than Kim Long, which used to be good,  but is now over priced and not as good anymore.  Avoid the crowds at Kim Long, and come here instead!",

The sign was hidden behind a tall plant and it wasn't until we were all ready to leave when we were told, it's cash only.  I feel bad for giving it a one star, so the second star is a pity star.  Ended up where some of us had to find an ATM machine to get cash.  At least with all the \"cash only\" establishment, they make it very clear.  This place has all the signs but all in hidden view.  This type of shadiness is a huge turn off!  With so many options, why be shady?  Because food and services are non-existent so they have to be shady.

Now, I'm no Pho expert, but I enjoy the Pho here every time I get it (3 times now).  I usually order number 21, which is the combination house Pho (I believe).  I usually go with my friend that speaks Vietnamese, and he orders all of the goodies to go in our Pho (leaves, sprouts, fatty oil (good for the arteries), vinegar onions, hot sauce and the sweet sauce.  The combination makes a very yummy broth.  And if there is one thing I've learned about my own tastes with soup, it is all about the broth.  I've only had Pho at one other place, and the broth here is a lot more flavorful.    As for the freshness of the food, I wouldn't say that it was the freshest, but it definitely wasn't spoiled.  The meat was tender enough for me to eat with my sore teeth (just got braces), which I was happy about.    The Vietnamese coffee is awesome.    The cash only system is very annoying.  The service is also shotty sometimes.  We had to ask twice for our fatty oil, and he brought regular onions instead of vinegar onions. Still, I always enjoy the Pho here.",

This is in regards to the Henderson location: BF and I decided to give this place another try since Lemongrass had been screwing up our orders the last couple times... boy did I regret giving this place another chance!  First off, the waitress couldn't speak an ounce of english nor understand it. I think it took about 5 mins going back and forth when I just wanted to order a rare steak and tendon (they didn't have it on the menu). My boyfriend finally says she wants a #whatever without the tripe... I wish he didn't even say that because.. there was tripe in my soup.  I didn't want to bother telling the waitress so I just grinned and beared it.  The summer rolls came out fast but they were so loosley rolled everything was falling out. They brought out the plate of bean sprouts and basil.. there was only one sprig of basil! HOW CHEAP!! No spinach like leaf that I liked the last time I came here.   The pho came out and the noodles were soooo chewy and stuck together that I was getting frustrated when eating it! Worse pho noodles ever. The broth wasn't bad but nothing special about it either.  Service is awful. I was surprised they came around to fill my water. The workers talk so loud in the same area without any regard to the customers.   Worse pho experience ever. Will not come back ever again.",

Also, the fact that the waiters and staff practically glare at you the whole time you're eating your meal gives you some weird feeling like you shouldn't even be in there in the first place.  Or maybe that weird feeling was just the bland food telling me that I chose the wrong pho spot?  Either way, you can best believe I ain't ever showing up here again.

We had to squeeze into our seats, and the other side of the table had people sitting behind them.   Anyway, pho is just OKAY. It's pricey for what it taste like.   I remember it cost 50 cents for tea/person. Wow..I thought that was crazy. I'll just stick with an iced cold water.   The experience wasn't spectacular.

I'm sorry, but if someone who looked like they haven't showered or changed clothes in a few weeks and just downed a keg of beer for lunch was cooking your food, you'd feel the same way!  So, restaurant owners.... PLEASE enforce proper hygiene for your staff.  And PLEASE, only allow your workers to take their smoking breaks in the back area outside, not the front!

Until I branched out to new restaurants,this was my regular spot. I would gamble,stop here before going home all the time. Then I went vegan. I guess more food conscious makes you notice more about what you're eating because I couldn't even tell you if this ever happened before. Two reasons,never ate anything but chicken pho,and two,I was usually either tipsy,or trust worthy & never even looked twice at my dishes. Tonight I went in to a old favorite & ordered the sauteed greens with garlic. They were wonderful,until I bit into dirt. Real True gritty dirt. Everyone knows collard greens must be washed thoroughly,a restaurant at best...I'm a country girl & knowing food,temperatures & bacteria I let the two bites of soil pass knowing my grandmas old saying \"you can't eat every bodies greens\". Then the hair came...I was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdone.my&s=1fcbafb61a671664d518e53a8cdd180ce6d9bfa8732d2e14b7d3d01cb49d71e8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">done.my</a> hair is to my hips,this hair was about 2 inches straight,mines not only curly,but completely covered in my nighttime wrap! He didn't charge me for the meal,just my drink....seeing he remembered my loyalty,I guess I'd expect better service than \"free entree\".

If you are looking for PHO, avoid this place at all cost. My family and I ordered their special #1 Pho Dac Biet and man was it a big disappointment. The pho bowls came out lukewarm and the tendon and meat were so rubbery. I watched how disappointed my family were half way eating their bowls.  We came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Also, did I mention the staff members are constantly bickering in the back?   Ordered: Pho Dac Dirt  Price: $8.99+ per bowl  My two cents: AVOID!",

How did we get to this? What else do I live for? Well, certainly not for the pho of this place, where the broth is flavorless, the meat unidentifiable, the vegetables withered, the plates and scissor (to cut our toddlers' meals into bit-sized pieces) dirty, the staff unruly, and our bill's total calculated by a classified algorithm that cannot seem to itemize anything.   It is time to reevaluate my life. Maybe today's the day I develop these so called \"standards\" everyone's been raving about when it comes to eating at certain places.",

    "text": "We're from out of town, venturing out from the strip after a few days of eating America cuisine and we're craving for some Vietnamese food. As we walked in, the place seemed very chaotic. Some customers were upset and left the restaurant before their food came out. That should have been a sign. We looked at each other and wonder if we should continue on or not. However, we were lazy and hungry so decided to give it a try any way.  It was a big mistake. I ordered bun bo Hue, the broth was very bland, not having the aroma of Bun Bo Hue at all.  So I asked for some shrimp paste in hope to make it tasted a little better. Our server heard me asking him but never replied and walked away. My friend reminded the waiter for the sauce supposedly to go with her food so I asked him about mine. He replied he heard me. How come he didn't utter any word if that's the case??? My two friends had pho and it was nothing extraordinary. The bathroom was very filthy too. During our dining experience, the whole crew were arguing about why did the upset customers left earlier right in the middle of the restaurant. As we were leaving the restaurant, I noticed the sign said \"family dining\", where you can order dishes and share among each other. Well, they didn't have that option that they advertised. Overall, I suggest you go to a different restaurant in the area.",

    "text": "First and foremost: the customer service is almost nonexistent. We went in and had to wait almost 10 minutes in the front before someone finally saw us, even though we were the only ones there.  I shared the #47 with my little cousin, my mom had the bahn mi, and my boyfriend had the fried catfish with rice and banana boba. Please note that the boba drink did NOT come with boba pearls, which was a little ridiculous because one would think it would not cost an extra charge. Oh well. At least I know now.  The food came out rather quickly, though not together (small problem, but still one to be said). My boyfriend really liked his catfish and my mom seemed to enjoy her sandwich, but my soup was SALTY. I could barely taste the meat and I felt like needing to drink 3 gallons of water afterward. Though the portions were bigger than you would usually get for a bowl of pho, I could barely eat it because it felt like I was drinking water from the Dead Sea (but even THAT would have been less salty).  Not to forget, we were not checked up on at all during our time and only when we flagged down one of the waitresses for 5 minutes did they come to give us our check. I'm not sure if she spoke English, too. She did not understand my mom when she asked for to-go boxes until another waiter came and translated.  Our total came up to about $50, which was a decent amount to pay for the amount of food we received. You pay up front at the register near the front of the restaurant. The signs up front says cash only, but I was able to pay with my card. They should really get rid of those 2 signs...  Overall, the food was decent, but the service was subpar. By a lot. I would probably come here again if I was craving some late night pho because it is open 24/7, but I doubt that would be anytime soon.",

There's big pictures of all the different Vietnamese dishes on the wall, with numbers next to them. As we sat down however, we started to realize everything was a little dirty. First, the table felt a little bit sticky, then the wooden chairs were sticky as well. Like they haven't been cleaned in months. The first pho spoon was dirty, so we had to dig for a clean one. This is not too uncommon in a Pho restaurant, so we ignored it. After we ordered, the food came out and, it was actually good. Not the best we've had, but definitely above average. Near the end of our meal, a little black bug crawled out from the window onto our table, my wife grabbed a napkin and brushed it away, so it scurried off quickly back toward the window. We got a good look at it, it was definitely a cockroach! We immediately lost our appetite and decided that we wanted to get out of this place. That's when I opened up Yelp and saw the other reviews. I've seen it first hand, so it's definitely real.   It's too bad, because the food is good, but until they get this placed cleaned and establish a better cleaning routine, I will never come back to this restaurant. Do yourself a favor and avoid until further notice.",

So I chalked up out terrible service, messed up orders and a attempted shady double billing on us being drunk or communication issues being like 3am. But last weekend we can in sober on a Sunday afternoon and of course not a surprise that it was terrible, service and shady billing. All three times the our orders never came correct and one was ordered by the # on the menu. Service is absolutely horrible even if you speak Vietnamese. The nouc bo is decent that is a shame as I am a pho snob. But the worst part is again they tried to over bill be by 58.00. I asked for the bill and they only told me the total 139.00 for 6 people I asked for the receipt and they reluctantly gave it to me. I asked about the 58.00 add line for extra meat. They called the waiter and he tried to fix it said the bill was 67.00 so I said ok them the other guys said no 71. They also added 15% gratuity on 6 person party... ok sure but they also pointed at the tip line when I paid by card and I said please you already billed me 15% and you do not deserve that tip at all.       Will not ever go there again =(",

I just felt like eating something else so I came across this place by accident and it sounded good to me.  It was crowded on a Saturday night, maybe 6 tables full when the capacity is for 40 tables.  So I ordered the pho, spring rolls and a dessert.  Spring rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, just standard.  It wasn't horrible, just OK.  Pho came next, appeared to be steaming and yummy.  I added the lime juice, bean sprouts and went at it.  Well, it didn't taste like much, the broth was bland and lacked punch that a good bowl of pho should be.  I was unimpressed with it.  And last was the cut jelly dessert which was probably the best of the three.  Service was decent, they were quick with everything, but then again it wasn't busy so what can you say? They are open 24 hours so that works in their favor, but I wouldn't really rush over here after a night of gambling or hanging out on the strip.  I saw two Caucasian guys come in and check out the menu, I was about to warn them that the food isn't worth it.  Luckily for them, they left before I had to say anything.    I wouldn't return.

My boyfriend was not at all impressed by the refined/contemporary decor of the restaurant  and the staff all in matching uniforms. Why? Because he didn't believe the restaurant was Vietnamese owned and therefore, the pho would not be \"authentic.\" Baby, who cares!? I'm hungover and  I want some damn PHO in mah belly! Anyway, we sit down for about 5-10 minutes and no one helps us out! Hungry, hungover, and irritated, we walked right out.  We drove right across the street to Pho Little Saigon since boyfriend ate there with his friends and said it was pretty good. Right when we walked in we could tell that the patrons were mostly Vegas locals compared to Pho Kim Long and its quiet ambiance. You'll also know it is Vietnamese owned because they blast \"Paris by Night\" videos on the TV screen.  So we both order a regular bowl of Pho Tai Nam (rare steak and well done flank beef noodle soup) and an order of Goi Cuon (shrimp and pork spring roll) to share. Although the pho was a little more oily than what I'm used to, it was pretty yummy and the portions are impressive. I come from pho central (san gabriel valley) and their portions aren't half this size unless you order a large bowl. Only bad thing was the cleanliness of the overalll restaurant...oh well, clean doesn't necessarily mean good right?  Next time you wake up with a hangover in vegas, do yourself a favor and eat a bowl of PHO. Just make sure you go into a pho restaurant that has Vietnamese patrons 'cause that way you'll for sure know its good stuff! Hahaha",

If you're careful and have lots of patience (throw in some luck), you might hit jackpot.  The three things I look for in a restaurant or eatery:   1) Good Service 2) Good Food 3) Clean  I have frequented this place many times. Of course, most of those visits include eating with my parents.  As soon as my mother walks through the doors, most of the regular wait staff recognize her. She definitely gets the Godfather treatment.  Our servers are alway quick to take the orders and the food has been very consistent. This is probably the only Pho place that does not include an immediate visit to the restrooms after the meal.  No need for the Pepto (or Immodium) at this place.   A story for the non-believers:  I  went to Pho Saigon with my parents during a recent visit.  Unfortunately, we probably picked one of the busiest day of the year to have Pho.  The restaurant was packed, and people were lining up at the door.  However, one of the the regular server saw my mother and waved us over to a table. Despite the full house, someone came and took our order within 5 minutes.  Our food came out all at once, in less than 15 minutes.   There was one not-so-good moment: we had three different servers, but one lady server tried to discourage us not to order the spring roles since it was \"busy\". She told us that it would take too long to make the rolls. Obviously she was new.  The other servers got us the spring rolls quickly when they realized that we wanted the spring rolls.  They also brought out an extra dish of tripe when my mother accidentally ordered my Pho without the tripe. The (regular) servers went above and beyond to help us with the orders.  Asian restaurants definitely operate on a different level compared to western style restaurants. You're not going to get the same service and the same quality of food. Pho Little Saigon is not Tallaivante.  It's not your typical TGI Friday franchise. It's a local place owned by local people.  The service can be sketchy, but the food is consistent.  It's my little Saigon.  Some of my fav dishes:  -Pho tai nam + bo vien -com thit nung +  tom nung -Ban hoi thit nung + tom nung -cafe su da -che ba mau -goi coun",

    "text": "Even though pho is not on the higher end for demands in vegas, we came here to dine for breakfast during our vacation since my boyfriends parents' previous experience was good. despite that fact, what we experienced this time around was nothing compared to what it was before. The pho was edible, but not what you'd settle for if you knew how pho is really supposed to taste like. A few of us thought that the broth tasted weird, and that the meat somehow tasted fake. Personally, i thought it was mediocre, just not the high quality kind you'd expect from a vietnamese-rooted restaurant. At the end of our meal, the check came out to be 102, with only 8 of us all ordering pho, which does not add up. I guess somewhere along the way, the math got messed up, or they tried to gyp us due to our large party. either way, go elsewhere for pho if you're considering this place. if not, then save your cravings for when youre back home!",

But not one seems like to seat us.   We finally sat around 10 mins, and I just ordered a pho with beef and tripe. My friend ordered a catfish soup.  The pho taste okay, kinda blend than I had before. My friend ordered catfish soup taste okay, but what really pissed us off, is that when she almost finished the soup found out there's no catfish at all only few shrimps. We tried to tell this to a sever to let them know, but no one would come to us. 20 mins later we finally reported this to an old guy, he just laughed and told us he didn't know anything at all. We expected him would tell this to one of their staff, but ended up no one come to us.  And the old guy took our bowls even though we didn't finish the soup, not sure he was trying to destroy the evidence or not. But it's really funny when we came to the front to tell the cashier that there's problem with our soup, and the cashier guy was really unfriendly told us,  \"where is your bowl? I need see the proof.\" \"Someone took our bowl already!\"  \"You should let us know that earlier before you done.\"  \"... we told the old guy\"  \"he is only the busboy knowing nothing.\"  That cashier guy is even anger than us, is that the way you supposed to treat your customer?   And what even pissed us is they have charged us extra, we ordered the fried calamari appetizer for $6.49, but he charged a meal for that about $13..   At the end, we walked out the door, the old guy came to us, and told us  \"Don't wanna see you guys again, okay?\" Like we wanna come back to this \"funny\" place?",

There are many reviews on here that are jacked.   The place is huge, lots of tables. All those complaining about it being small and cramped were in a different place.   The staff wasn't warm or friendly, but they were efficient and courteous. Nothing resembling rude. Those people may have been in a different place, too.   My seafood soup was incredible! Huge portion, lots of goodies in it, enough for two meals. I also got fresh coconut water, right out of the coconut. Yum! The soup broth was so good that I wanted to come back the next day for more. Those complaining about it being salty were in a different place. I don't like salty. This was perfect.   The floors and tables were clean. Bathroom needs some help, but wasn't dirty. Still, no bugs or rats or Health Department warnings. Don't know what place that was.   My only major complaint is the cash-only situation. Who carries cash? I'll be honest, that is the single reason I hadn't eaten there before, and the one that prevents me from coming back more often, because getting cash is a pain in the neck. Yes, they have a cash machine right there in the restaurant, but the fees from the machine and then your bank end up costing more than your meal.  Still, when I want superior Pho, they are worth the drive.",

    "text": "So after a long day of touring around Vegas , we decided to stop here for food. As soon as we got in, they seated us and we waited a while before they came to even give us the menus. Then the manager or whoever came over to take our order but he was rude . He barely gave us the menus and told us to hurry up because he was busy. That irritated me .   Food: the beef pho had so much beef that there was barely even any noodles , for the price , I think it wasn't worth it . The pork chops were good and the fried rice was decent too . It's just that after the fried rice was finished, the plate was really wet or they had put too much oil or something .",

Or maybe you're used to eating from a dumpster, but just feel like taking a chance dining on some extra-rancid cuisine today? Have I got a place for you!   I didn't know this until I researched, but they have been closed down by the health department a whopping 7 times! for a \"Multi-generational cockroach infestation\" among other things!!!  This dirty, nasty, unsanitary toilet of a restaurant should've been out of business long ago. The employees are despicable. They touch money, trash and more...all without washing their hands.   I didn't know this until I researched, but they have been closed down by the health dept. a whopping 7 times! \"Multi-generational cockroach infestation\" anyone?  They served me a sour, rotten Diet Coke that expired more than 2 years ago. After I almost vomited, I told them it was long expired and bitter. They brought me ANOTHER one. I refused it. I told them how disgusting it was and all they said was \"Okay. I don't charge you for it.\" REALLY? No apology....nothing. My friend was sick for 2 days after eating his meal. These fucking people have no clue what they're doing in this place. Piss poor pathetic service, dirty bowls, dirty utensils, horrible food, dirty tables and floors. Everyone who works there is a rude fucker. I think they require it to work there.  Also, they rejected my credit card. \"Cash only! Cash only!\" they barked at me. Yes, no credit cards accepted. We were overcharged several times, but they never offered an itemized check, so they totally got away with it. This is third world dining at it's absolute saddest. Fuck this fucking shit restaurant. Run Forrest, RUN!!!!!!!!",

One of the owners ran after the dog and tossed the dog outside into the 100+ degree heat.   I was dragged into this place reluctantly by my family, as they craved Pho.  I first noticed that the place was dark, and the energy was very negative. The people who work here seem miserable.   I ordered a noodle dish with vegetables, and my meal came a good 10 minutes after everyone elses. I guess it takes that long to put extra meat in my dish. It came out with Pork and Chicken.  I immediately sent it back, as I do not meat.  10 minutes after that, the waiter brought out a greasy,  intensely sweet noodle dish. It was the worst noodle dish I have ever had.  The predominate flavor was corn syrup.  When I mentioned that my noodle dish was the worst I had ever had, not only did the waiter not apologize, but he took my dish, tossed it into the garbage can with a look of disgust.    When I walked out of the restaurant, I saw leftover food which had been tossed right next to the entrance all over the sidewalk. I could not believe what I was seeing.   When we got home, I realized that waiter who did not provide a sales receipt over charged us 5 by dollars.",

    "text": "This place needs to be shut down or they're in serious need of a new management. Came here last night for a quick dinner (cuz it was almost empty with no wait) while Izakaya Go next door had a 30 min wait. Asked for a small size Pho noodle soup and was told no small size. I asked why, waiter said bluntly: \"It's the holiday.\" What????? Excuse me??? I said it's not stated on the menu that you don't offer small bowl of Pho on holidays. He continued: \" You can talk to the boss.\" Ok! Talked to the boss and got the same response. WTF!? Excuse my language-for whatever reason that you don't want to sell small size Pho, a simple apology with an offer for an alternative would put me at ease but you had to be rude and made me feel that ordering a small size Pho was my fault to begin with. The bad attitude was rediculous. I felt I was treated less of a customer and felt like being ripped off to buy a large Pho. Hello!!!!! Do you know why Izakaya Go was fully packed with a 30 min wait time while your Pho restaurant which is twice bigger but is only less than a quarter full with customers? On the day after Christmas?? Jesus Christ!! Here's why! Besides getting rid of your unfresh/bad smelly food/dishes (read from other Yelpers) and your whole other issues with hygiene and rude staffs, You need to improve by learning from your neighbor businesses. Businesses can't survive if you can't keep up with the competition nowadays and CUSTOMER SERVICE is a top priority in retail service industry especially restaurants. As soon as we found out we could get seated at Izakaya Go next door, we immediately left. May Lord bless you for God's sake... A negative star for this shitty place if it's an available option.",

I understood that the place was very busy considering it was New Year's Day aka Hangover Day and pho is the cure to all hangovers and such. But that is no excuse for not having good customer service.   First off, the place was very unorganized. Some people were taken to tables not cleaned yet, having to stand and wait for workers to clean them. Others were actually sat at dirty tables. Secondly, it took quite a bit of time to even receive menus. As soon as we received our menus, it then took forever to get our order taken and even get our beverages out. Plus, two tables who were sat after us initially received service before we even did. Furthermore while one of the servers took my order, he back sassed me when I was just trying to confirm whether or not he jotted down what I wanted correctly. We received our beverages (keep in mind we only had waters) ten minutes after our order was taken and received our food more than half an hour later. It just seemed as if it was hard for the servers to keep track of which tables came first. The ambience even felt a bit off, as the servers shouted to each other from across the room. I feel as if they need to develop a better system to keep everything in an orderly fashion.   As for the food, I ordered spring rolls and pho with chicken. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls had a bit too much of a coconut flavor in it, while the chicken in the pho was a bit spongey in texture.   Overall, not a great experience. If it wasn't for the fact that this place is 24/7 (convenient for those drunken late nights/early mornings) and the fact that I came here before when it was far less busy and rather very slow, I would've gave it one star.",

    "text": "Mediocre food and rude customer service!  I was first attracted to this place because of recommendations from two Hawaii references. When my friends and I walked in and were seated, I was impressed with the extensive menu. So far so good. But when my order arrived, they brought me rice with my beef stew instead of the bread I had ordered. I informed the waiter (who acted like he was the boss) that I had ordered bread instead of rice. He grabbed a menu and rudely pointed out to me that the beef stew comes with rice OR bread and I needed to tell him which I wanted when I ordered. I sharply replied that I indeed had ordered bread. (My dining partner said he heard my order of bread instead of rice, so I wasn't delirious). The rude waiter snatched the plate of rice and brusquely said I would have to wait for the bread.  About 15 minutes later, another waiter finally brought \"my\" bread when I was almost done with the stew. Two of my other dining mates said they saw the waiter grab the bread from another table to give to me. Naturally, I refused to eat \"my\" bread since it previously had been on someone else's table. I'm not sure about Las Vegas health department requirements, but it seems to me that restaurants shouldn't be re-serving food that had already been given to others.  The stew broth was so-so in flavor, and the beef was sinewy and tough. I've had way better in Honolulu. Of course, I can't comment on the quality of the bread.  I won't return to this place. I can understand waiters making a mistake on orders. However, in this case, the rude waiter's manner in dealing with the problem - blaming me, the customer - was completely unacceptable and downright RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS. I would give this place a half star at best.",

For every pho, hole in the wall restaurants, I've made it to the point to order just one kind of soup...and that's their number one soup on their lists of what made them famous and known for...tasting their trademark soups! This time, PLS, really is not up to 5 star, why?? Maybe they've change their people at the back, looking for cheaper affordable chefs...can they cook?? Sure they can! But NEVER the same quality as those that originally made the soup that made them known their trademarks!!  What??? No free internet?? The owner never shared this info to their employees for the needs of the customers?? It was given to me every time I asked for it before. ...are they downgrading?? I don't know. The soup spoon was rough. Like calcium rough on a swimming pool stain. So I just gulp down the soup without the soup-spoon.

    "text": "I've been here three times.  I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.  A relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.  I've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.  At the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.  One thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.  I like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.  Something I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.",

I invoked the rule, if there are a lot of customers, there's a good chance it will be a good place. The down fall with that idea is that the waiting line is long and hanger will be quickly.   Plan B: a semi full restaurant.  Ordered the stir fry water crest with garlic, braised catfish in clay pot and tofu soup.  The water crest with garlic was the star of the night. The garlic, salty and texture of the water crest was on point. It's exactly how I and my family had done it thousands of time.   Braised catfish: average at best mainly because they rushed the process and the flavors didn't had time to permeate into the catfish. The sauce that the catfish was braised in was overwhelmed by fish sauce and thick soy sauce to get that fake color. The fish itself was too soggy.  Tofu soup: it good and healthy, nothing special.",

I walked to the front while my boyfriend waited at the table. I paid for our lunch and when I walked back to the table, our two friends walked into the restaurant and decided to take our table so they could have lunch. One of the workers cleared our food and took their orders as we left. My friend just called me saying that we left without paying so they paid for our food. She said the men employees were SO SURE that I did not pay so my friends had to also pay for our meal as well AGAIN. Scumbags literally STOLE THEIR MONEY. FYI to all customers if you want good quality customer service and food....go down the street to PHO KIM LONG!  Please see attached proof of payment. We'd go back if w didn't have a plane to catch home now.",

    "text": "Put in our order, was told that the dish I ordered, clay pot fish, may take awhile. I stated that it was \"ok\", that I'd wait, since the other half of our party hasn't arrived yet, anyway. They brought out my dish at the same time that they brought out my mom and sister's pho, which doesn't take long to make since the soup is already made. The fish came out looking sad as hell, very disappointing, since I KNOW it's not that hard to make! If you've ever had the clay pot fish, you'd know that it should look a rich caramelized deep brown color. What I was served, did not have that rich color. On top of it not looking appetizing...  THE FISH WAS NOT COOKED!!  Now, as much a fan I am of sushi, this dish is not meant for the fish to be raw.   My mom and sister ordered pho, and their soup came out lukewarm. Anyone that's had pho knows the soup should be steaming! Furthermore, when my mom asked for more basil since they only gave us 1 sprig for two bowls of pho, the man responded, \"we gave you some\"... that did it!! Up til now, my mom was cool about everything, but now my mom was mad!! She help up the one sprig and said (in Vietnamese), \"You gave us one sprig of basil for two bowls of pho, how is that enough?\" The man walked away mad and never came back.   Our experience was so bad there that I actually called the other half of our party that we were waiting for and told them to NOT COME THERE, that it was \"THAT\" bad!  I asked for another bowl of rice, since I wasn't eating the fish, I was gonna eat more rice to fill me up. IT NEVER CAME.   We finally gave up hope for this place and talked about not leaving a tip, because, lets face it, they did not deserve any sort of tip! Well guess what???? When we went to go pay, these MF's added 15% tip to our bill!! They are thiefs! There is no sign that tells patrons that they automatically do this, and our group of 4 people is hardly enough people to do this to.  They must know they suck, therefore gotta steal their 15% tip from all the suckers that actually walk into this restaurant.   If I could give zero stars, I would do just that!",

I order a bowl of chicken Pho and fried dumpling the food was pretty much average plus nothing really fancy here. As I was eating one of the waiter decided to blow his nose in the  restaurant he did turn to face the wall but I could still see and hear him, when he was done he thought his Kleenex in a trash can in the restaurant went sat back down without washing his hands \"clue # 4\" This place has 390 reviews on Yelp with 2 1/2 stars, so my experience here was not that great.",

Well let me begin by saying that the service is mediocre. A little wait before a waiter took our orders. Our friends ordered Pho ga(chicken noodle soup) and when the soup came out. The broth was very dark and sure enough they were using beef broth and added chicken in the beef soup and called it a day.The whole point of eating chicken noodle soup is because of healthy reason but this restaurant was too lazy or they've just cheated their customers by not cooking chicken for the broth. As for us, we ordered com ga roti(Cornish hen red rice), the dish came out and husband said this is not Cornish hen but just a fried chicken thigh with red coloring and the rice is not even red like it was supposed to be. It tasted very plain. The reason I'm writing this because I feel that this restaurant is cheating their customers. We would never ever going back to this restaurant. I'm not writing this out of spite but I think people should know before going here.",

The food comes pretty fast. It's not the best pho place but it can do when you just want a bowl of soup.   Con for me: owner and staff talks loud. Especially since I can understand Vietnamese. They aren't good with customer service. Not sure if I can say they are welcoming.   Another thing: make sure to request for a check. You will see... they charge you qualities already. So you don't have to tip them even more. Tipping should be by choice. I understand if you come with 20 people. But being sneaky and not letting the guest know. Now.. that got me mad.",

Is better then most places around town or I wouldn't have been coming back so this long. They are open 24/7 and when I get my soup out its always hot. Did I mention they are open 24/7? They employees do bicker in the background but it never bothered me. I usually get take out and a extra cup of broth for 2$.Perfect for winter. Or something casual late night with your friends. I like this place :)",

Their pho is pretty good, but what I loved the most was their egg rolls. They were delicious! I came with a lot of friends so we ordered a lot of food. The food came out super fast and was delicious! We had the bbq chicken (yummy), chow mein with chicken (amazing) and fried tofu (pretty good). All of this besides the pho plates, and all were really good. Yes we took a lot of food home but even the next day tasted just as good. I can say I will be back to try more of their food! (Only thing I would have preferred would be for the pho to be a bit hotter in temperature, but besides that the taste was delicious).",

Fresh coconut (actual fruit) was perfect and eating the fruit with a spoon was easy since they brought us young coconuts and not old ones.   My group all paid separate and we believe we were all ripped off a bit. Didn't make sense that my pho + coconut drink came out to be $13...but didn't notice til after I paid and thought about it.

They rush you to order in the most rudest way, saying things like, \"hurry up.\" Really, bro? I ordered two appetizers while everyone else ordered a bowl or plate. How is it that my order came out last when I ordered two spring rolls and pot stickers (this was a 45 minutes wait for this order). I had to repeat three times to the same waiter what I ordered, reminded him of the potstickers since he only repeated the spring rolls order, then he said, \"oh, you should probably forget about it. I don't know what's the situation with those.\" I told him, \"then you better make sure it's not on the receipt later.\"   If a zero star rating exist, then this place deserves a million zero star rating.",

From Garden Grove/Westminster to the streets of Ktown so I'm not like wtf to 24 hr pho shops. I am always curious of how often they clean out their soup base though.  I usually go to my regular joints on Spring Mountain but this time I wanted to try something different so I stopped by Pho Little Saigon before heading out on the road back to LA. Give it a shot, why not?  I agree with some of the reviewers, lack of staff. The place isn't THAT big but if it gets busy then what? My experience with pho places are that if they're really good, then the staff is plentiful and the food comes out faster than McDonald's because they want you in/out of their place so they can make room for the next customers.   My pho was decent. There was plenty of meat and noodles so they weren't tight on that for sure. You don't get your own plate of veggies though. Three people in my party ordered pho and we only received one plate of the bean sprouts, lemon, & basil leaves. Most pho restaurants will give you one plate per pho bowl, not here. The spring roll was mediocre, actually don't even bother. No extra veggies for you there either.  Next time, I'll probably play it safe and return to my other usual pho restaurants.  CASH ONLY.",

The restaurant is poorly laid out and the tables are way too close. It's very disorganized coming in and no one really knows where to go. I tried to stay safe and get fried rice today.

There was 6 of us and we weren't even an issue we just enjoyed our food. When we asked to pay card the workers all got upset and accepted our cards anyways. As we try to make them understand how to split our checks (which wasn't hard at all but they made it so difficult and yelled at us ALOT) they still somehow messed it up. THEY EVEN ADDED 15% GRATUITY.

Pho Little Saigon Ambiance & Service:  Tall ceilings with plenty of long tables to accompany big parties makes for a spacious dining area.  There's a full service bar and a mini-stage for karaoke or live music I'm assuming.  Service was friendly and they kept the drinks fresh as we our lunch meeting extended after we finished our pho.  Pho Little Saigon..Pho & Egg rolls:  The egg rolls were full length versus half length rolls you might come across at a Vietnamese restaurant.  They were the perfect crispy and packed with flavor.   We had the P5 Pho Tai Chin: Rare steak with brisket soup.  The broth was very savory.  There was a generous serving of noodles and rare steak that was delish.  This was a very solid bowl of Pho.  Pho Little Saigon is a solid Pho choice in the area.  The pricing and size of the Pho bowls gives you some pretty good value overall.  I'm nor sure why the Yelp rating is so low but I'd definitely come back for more Pho or other Vietnamese dishes.  Enjoy!",

What we like about this place is their portion sizes and price.  Very reasonably priced meals and generous portion sizes.  Of course the food tastes great too.  We've ordered rice plates, pho noodle soup, and bahn mi sandwiches.  The rice plate was ordered with grilled pork.  One thing to note about the pork is the cut seems to be from the pig's butt or belly.  It's a bit fatty.  I know some may not like that but it was tasty for us.  The sandwich was good and before everyone starts complaining it does say on the menu that it's made with cold cut meat and not grilled pork (or other meats). It was still very good but i'm surprised they wouldn't offer bahn mi with grilled pork especially if they offer grilled pork on rice plates?  We will probably make this our go-to spot in Vegas from now on",

I just gotta say that this place is one of the best pho places I've ever been too. The pho broth is one of a kind. One that cures hangovers with just a slurp. The noodles are boiled not too soft or not too hard. And the meat is so tender a bite of it will just make your mouth waters.  The appetizer egg rolls were really appetizing. It didn't even need car cables to give a jump start to the meal. Wrap the lettuce and condiments around the egg roll and dip in the sweet savoring fish sauce and bam you're in a place called heaven.   The servers are top of the line.

I like this place and will come back to try other goodies.... I will recommend it. Yelp Elite get a 15% discount on Pho and Chicken wings every Wednesday from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm.

Their banh canh cha ca was unexpectedly spicy from the cha ca. Broth was so basic with their not soft enough banh canh. Banh Beo needed more meat than just a tiny bit of shrimp. Not to mention the ga roti, chicken was not flavored enough. The safest thing to order was bun thit nuong here.",

The employees were very unprofessional as they were sitting behind us gossiping about their employer.  The lady that rung up our check added an extra springroll into the check. I ordered 2 springrolls but she charged me for 3, as seen in the picture attached.   Please be aware that this place will scam you by adding additional items to your oder! Make sure you check the receipt before paying!! This is very shady business!",

Me and other parties complained when we noticed he was seating people that came in after us because he didn't transfer the names over to the new sheet! Terrible system.  Upon being seated, they took the orders of the table next to us who came in at the same time but completely skipped over us. 10 minutes later they came back to take ours... ridiculous.  My party ordered one pho dish, one rice dish, one vermicelli dish and one hu tieu. All were delicious and came to us in a timely manner. I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee (comes in a styrofoam cup and lid), the waitress looked confused and went to two other tables nearby before delivering it to ours. Seems like there isn't good communication for waiting tables.  CASH ONLY!  I will not be returning, and do not recommend this place.",

The soup taste as if they added hot water and instant pho powder together. The other herbs only managed to give the pho a stale rotting taste. The combo pho had mostly stomach and super skimpy meat. The egg rolls were mediocre but at least crispy. The beef stew pho was horrible in its flavor , texture consistency, appearance, and taste. I ate the beef and considered the rest a loss. The jelly drink was a waste of calories without much flavor. The jelly was hard and coconut milk overly sweet to compensate. The dumplings were typical of any freezer grade and deep fried taste, however I believe the best dish out of this meal.   Never again.",

There are so many things to say about the bad service here.  1. Although there is no wait time to be seated, there is a wait time that takes freakin' forever just for them to order your food. We were there for 20 minutes before they ordered our food. And it's not just this time, but EVERY SINGLE TIME WE VISIT..   2. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE SERVERS. I cannot stress that enough. We asked for forks because my mother doesn't know how to use chopsticks and the server gave us this really disgusted face. Um, what is your problem mister server sir?! -_______- IF YOU DON'T LIKE SERVING PEOPLE, GET ANOTHER JOB. SIMPLE AS THAT.  3. SLOW REFILLS. Dude, they gave us one glass of water and NEVER refilled our drinks ever again.. Our server was no where to be seen. It's like he dumped our food and took a freaking five hour break! Seriously?!?!?!?!?! Ugh..  I would come back to this place, but I'd probably order take out instead. Wouldn't want to stay and dine here if their servers are going to be complete a-holes to their PAYING CUSTOMERS.",

    "text": "This used to be my  bad relationship. For many years, I came to this place. My sister and I had a favorite Pho spot that had closed down and so on our mission to find a new Pho spot we settled at this place.   I was a weekly regular, that is how much I used to love this place. In the beginning this place was kind to me. It knew exactly what I wanted and always exceeded my expectations. If I was having a bad day, I could come in and be greeted by the servers who were always so welcoming to me and would serve me up a big bowl of delishness.  You know how you hit that 7 year itch in a relationship? I guess that is what you say happened to me. The service went down. The quality of the food went down. They had a couple of bad health inspections and to me, it just never was the same.  So I slowly stopped going. However, just like that bad relationship that you keep coming back to, \"because just maybe it'll change and go back to how it used to be\", I kept going back. And some days, I would be like \"Yes!\" this is why I love this place. Yet, more often than not it was like slow torture. The broth would get worse and worse, the meat would be tough and chewy. The last of the last was when I went and it tasted like there was soy sauce in my bowl of Pho. Definitely not okay. Just more often than not, it would be bland and flavorless. How fun is that?  I should give this place a 3 star based on the fact that I was a die hard fanatic for years but considering that I have visited this place in the last couple of months and it's still poor quality, I just can't.   I remember when I first signed up with yelp and saw all the poor reviews, I didn't get it. I had thought to myself these people do not know what they are talking about. Kinda like, when you have that bad relationship and everyone else keeps telling you need to leave but you just can't, not until you are ready.   Well, that chapter is closed and this relationship is no more. Onto better Pho!  (I orginally put this review under the wrong location. MY BAD! It has now been corrected to the rightful owner.)",

Beyond that, there is nothing too special about this restaurant.   I only had the pho and I have to agree with other reviewers that the broth is not very good. The service is also not very good, my water was never refilled. Lastly, prices were on the high side. The pho was about $8 a bowl for the regular size, they had a smaller size, but no larger sizes or options for extra noodles or meat. I wanted to order bahn mi as well, but at $3 dollars a sandwich, I decided to pass.  I guess you could say this place is like Pho Kim Long, only a little closer to the strip. Oh, I guess that's another positive aspect of this restaurant, not enough to bump it up to three stars though.",

A few minutes later our server came and took our order. Weird part is that he didn't want to write down our order. I guess I did not care until 5 minutes later that he came back saying he forgot what we've ordered. 10 minutes later he came back saying they ran out of springs rolls. He tried to give us something else. we reused and said no. He didn't like our answer and started acting nasty with us. He said I was not understanding and I did not speak English LOL. There is a difference between refusing a service or something and not being able to speak or understand English. He gave us a dirty look and left immediately. Finally, he did bring our food. Food was average not great.  I have to say this server was very rude, uneducated and somewhat he treats customers like if they were idiots. He feels we had to kiss his a$$ just because we were hungry and he worked at this restaurant. Lame service!!!",

    "text": "There is little doubt that this is the best Pho restaurant in Las Vegas.  I think the reason why there are a lot of bad reviews here on yelp is because  a lot of Pho restaurants on Spring Mountain  have the word \"SAIGON\" in their title. There is \"Pho old SAIGON\", \"Pho SAIGON 8\", \" Pho SAIGON\" \"Pho Huong SAIGON\" \"Pho Vietnam SAIGON\", and even another \"Pho Little Saigon\" that is an unrelated restaurant. .  I think most the people are confusing this place for another restaurant because there is no way you could dislike the food from here.   Everyone who follows my weird and profanity filled reviews knows that my favorite food in the world is Miso Ramen.  The Pho at PHO LITTLE SAIGON is the only Pho in the world which I would eat over Ramen on occasion.  Obviously, I would still rather go to a place like \"Anime Ramen\" where everyone knows your name after only your 1st visit, and your bowl of noodles practically comes with a show + entertainment....but  sometimes I'm just in the mood for cilantro and a clear soup.  I recommend everyone to try the Rare Steak Pho.  They use a very high quality cut of steak. I think it might be petite sirloin because it was extremely soft tender and just melted in your mouth. It almost had the texture of Filet Mignon. What I really liked was how the steak  was blood red. They don't even cook it, they just poor the hot soup over the meat and serve immediately.   The broth is crystal clear and clean. It looks like the water off the coast of Hawaii because you could see clear down to the bottom.  The top of the broth is full of natural oils. These oils are common in soups where you had to boil bones for over 20 hours. They are purely natural and are a great visual indication of the high quality.  They use Red Onions instead of generic onions! Red onions make the Pho taste so much better than the regular brown onions.   They are definitely not cheap here. You get over 1/2 a pound of free bean sprouts and basil. You ask for extra limes and they literally hand you the whole lime(and it's a giant lime).  Most places like \"Pho So 1\" and \"Pho Kim Long\" give you half of even a half of a lime wedge.  If you ask for extra onions, they literally slice the whole onion and give you the whole thing.   The service was very quick and fast.  I think it's worth mentioning that they are Cash Only. So don't blow all your cash at the casino..save some of it and bring it here. It is also worth mentioning that they are open 24 hours/ 7 days a week.   From now on, this is the only Pho restaurant I would ever go to in Las Vegas. Not only is the food great, but you don't have to sit next to the typical drunk-degenerate-immature Vegas Club Douche like at  \"Pho Kim Long\". And you don't have to be ignored and treated like crap like at \"Pho So 1\". PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits my lifestyle. It's open 24 hours, it's atmosphere is more quite and relaxing, and the service is alright by me!",

This was the first visit sharing with a friend.  Our second visit was the worst, and we never want to come back again.  They had bad customer service, and no greeting.  This time the customers were not packed; looked rather empty.  Less than four tables were filled.    Our order was hu tieu hai sang, seafood noodle soup and dry noodle shredded and sweet pork, bun bi nem nuong.  The sweet pork tasted like rotten, and the shredded pork smells like carrion and old.  I poured on the fish sauce and ate it anyway because my friend insisted.  Fortunately I did not feel sick because or maybe I did.  We had Starbucks ice-coffee at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas later that day and both of us had a headache just minutes from drinking a few sips.  My friend had the seafood noodle soup at Pho Little Saigon, and she did not finished it only a fifth into it and said it was not good.  Tasted flavorless.  I do not recommend any Pho Little Saigon in the Las Vegas area.  Go waste your money somewhere else---not here! 3775 W Spring Mountain Rd",

Where do I begin, there are soo many negatives that I can write a whole page about this place.  First of all, they were rude when taking our order.  We waved at 3 waiters  and each one told us to wait a minute.  Finally, a girl w/ glasses comes over and takes our order but in the middle of it she runs into the kitchen and does not come back until about a minute later.  RUDE!!  There are pictures of the food on the wall w/ #s next to them.  You would think that it corresponds to the # on the menu but NOPE.. its not even numbered the same as the menu.  DO NOT ORDER WATERMELON TAPIOCA!  The picture on the wall look like the typical watermelon juice drink one would find at ANY tapioca drink place.  It should be RED... the ones that we got came out looking like blended pepto bismo!!!!  It was PINK... of course we complained and said it doesn't look like anything like that picture.  One guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder!  So we refused the drink!  We ordered (2) #19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks.  One came out and I was still waiting for mine, so finally we got someone's attention and told him we're still missing another one of this (pointing at the first #19 we got).  They guy was like whats that, so I said #19, OMG-- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away.  We were like NO what are you doing!  We ordered 2 of this, leave this one and bring another.    I swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place!!!!  STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY!!!   The food is not even good!!!!  Worst Pho EVER!!!!!  Paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was!!!",

This includes Khai Vi appetizers like Bi Cuon and Banh Xeo; Rice Porridge (Chao); 20 different Pho soups; about the same number of Com Dia rice plates and Bun Vermicelli dishes, Banh Canh (Vietnamese Udon); Bo Bai Mon (7 course beef) for $22.99, and Hu Tieu. Also Vietnamese desserts and drinks.   I tried the Hu Tieu My Tho and it was excellent. You can order this wet as a soup or dry as more like a stew, with the more chewy clear sukiyaki type noodles. I ordered it dry, which comes with a side bowl of soup broth to pour over the ingredients after mixing.   The Hu Tiel My Tho was chock full of ingredients: several large shrimp, a couple of fish cake balls, Chinese style sliced pork, Vietnamese style sliced pork, a couple of boiled Quail eggs, lots of green onions, chives, green leaf lettuce, yellow onions, and ground pork in a pork paste sauce. Delicious and only $6.59.  This place has 3 strobe lights blinking outside to help you find it. Inside, they have the obligatory plasma screens (4 in total!) showing Vietnamese variety show DVDs. They are open from 8:00am to 11:00pm 7 days a week! They say Cash Only, but they accepted my credit card when I asked them.   If you are stuck on the strip and don't want to spend another $50 on overpriced Casino food, go west half a mile on Spring Mountain.",

The service is quick & what the staff lacks in english communication skills, they make up for in smiles, prompt service, quality, & quantity. The boba drinks feature nice smooth starchy balls that are softer than some of the other places I've tried. The coconut is my favorite. It cools the mouth & throat after powering down a spicy bowl of this wonderful soup. #35, steak, brisket, & tendon is my go to order. I've also tried the fried rice here, & it was top notch. The only reason I didn't give Saigon 5 stars is because the cleanliness left a little to be desired, & the beef balls were a bit too chewy. But don't let appearances fool you.

Other people took a bite.  Sour?  Turns out the meat in the egg rolls was spoiled and they still served it!  I can't believe a place that is open 24 hours would pull this stunt.  We are not drunk!  No one in our party drinks.  We can tell what good Vietnamese food is suppose to taste like.  But if the customer can't taste it, why waste it?  The Pho is mediocre at best.  Nothing to brag about.  Do yourself a favor, just keep driving, just keep driving,  Keep driving.  Then they tried to use a BS excuse and claim the egg rolls was not at it's best but still edible.  Not at it's best?  IT'S FRICKEN SOUR and you CAN KILL SOMEONE!  The only plus was that my bro was constipated from eating too much at the buffet.  Not anymore!  Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, oh what a relief it is.

They were not busy, had 2 other parties that sat down before us. Our server was as old man who brought us our water quickly, Good Job, but did not bring me a high chair or asked if I needed. I asked and brought me one but it did not have any clips for the belt and was ready to take our order, I asked to give us a minute and I felt that he expected for me to have our order ready. The menu is extensive and I want to explore the menu and see anything exotic/different. When he came back my father-in-law being vietnamese did not know how to read english and asked if there was small for the pho and he responded \"No\", rudely and there's only regular. I change the high chair myself and none of them had clips but there was one that was tied, I used that one. They brought out our pho but it wasn't not steaming hot but warm. I finished my water and I moved it towards to the waiter to show him that it is empty. He did not bring a pitcher, I walked over to my the table next to me that had the pitcher of water and refilled it myself. I am in Las Vegas, it's in the middle of summer, people get thirsty. They shouldn't have to asked to get water refilled. I put my herbs and bean sprouts in my pho, since the pho broth was not hot my bean sprouts didn't get soft still raw not a picky eater. The flavor of the beef broth was more water down and plain. The original waiter never came back to serve us but another server came by and refilled our waters. I came to the register and paid noticed that it was cash only. I was told the price and I asked for the reciept and noticed that they charged extra $2 for rare sliced beef on the side, father-in-law asked for rare sliced beef on the side not extra sliced beef. We got more beef it's ok. I talked to the cashier that rang me up and told him that the old guy was rude and this is a service industry that it's important. I said that I'm from out of town. I will never come back here. Save yourself from a bad experiance, there plenty of other places to go in the asian district then this place. I noticed from other post that they charged a 15% mandatory tip. I did not notice will I was checking out.",

Remembered reading a review on this place, I thought I'd give it a try.    I ordered the combination Pho with all the trimmings and I didn't like it at all!  The broth was only lukewarm but what made me sick was that it smelled and tasted gamy.  I had ordered a small bowl.  As hungry as I was, I barely finished 1/2 of it and just gave up.  It left such bad taste (and memory) in my mouth that I didn't want Pho during the rest of my stay!  And let me tell you, I am a Pho-natic and I can eat Pho everyday!  The service was not bad as the other reviewers described.  In fact it was rather friendly.  We were served water and menu right away as we sat down.  But perhaps it was because we were one of the only 3 tables of customers there at the time.    I will be better prepared next time and find another place to go to if I know I am going to arrive late to Vegas again.",

Second, the owner's lil boy was in there riding his bicycle!! Are you kidding??? The lil boy was screaming, throwing tantrums, hitting the chairs, etc. w/ his bike and his parents just sat there watching tv. Mind you the restaurant had about 15 customers in there.   Thirdly, I asked the waitress what something was in my soup and she said she didn't know. I asked her if she worked there and she said yes but never tried that soup before. I don't care if you've tried it or not - you're Vietnamese, you work there, you should know your own damn food!!  Fourth, they had a long extension cord running from inside the restaurant - out the door through the parking lot - ending God knows where.   Lastly, never going there again.",

    "text": "This review is based on 3 visits there, 2 lunches and 1 dinner.  Overall, it was just OK but I would love to give a higher star.  Why not 3 stars? because the inconsistencies of the product.  On the first day (lunch) we order pho (good), rice dish (also good), the salted peppered squid (love it) and Vietnamese style ice coffee.  We enjoyed them all very much and even ordered the squid to go for our road trip (where there are no Asian food) to stretch our our cravings.   Based on that meal it would be a solid 4 stars.  BUT....  6 days later we came back for dinner and that meal was barely a 2 star. The same exact dish looked different, tasted different, squid was tough. All of us were disappointed.  The day time chef was much better (after all this place opens 24 hr a day in Vegas).  To prove our theory, we went back the following day for lunch and again the food is good.  If you are reading this, go lunch time.  Don't go dinner time.  Price wise I felt it was a little on the expensive side compared to the San Francisco Bay Area (specifically San Jose and Milpitas area). But to get the similar quality food in the middle of the dessert is something I am not complaining.  Our three meals for family of 4 is around $60.",

My family was stranded because the Strip was closed and we were unable to get to our hotel, so they told us to stay there as long as we needed until we were allowed back. They also had a lot of TV's around the restaurant and everyone was allowed to go outside to watch the fireworks from the Strip!  The service was a little bit slower than what I'm used to at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it wasn't overly long. The pho was pretty good, standard for a normal pho place. I got a jackfruit shake, and you could taste some jackfruit pieces. Yum!  Also a note: They only offer pho and rice dishes after about 10pm or so. Don't expect spring rolls during the late night hours! Cash only as well with a small-ish parking lot.",

Several of my other friends ordered different types of pho, and all had the same review. Basically, the pho was too minty, and I could definitely smell what they were talking about. maybe we're spoiled out here in the bay area with pretty damn good pho, but they needa step their game up a little bit at this spot.",

My family of 4 ordered 3 Pho Dac Biet and one Bun Chao Tom (grilled shimp past with noodles).  When our Pho came out it was warm.  It wasn't hot enough to cook the raw meat then put on top of pho.   The worst part of the meal was when the Bun Chao Tom.   As we were slicing into the meat we discovery that it was still cold.  We were completely disgusted at this point.  We paid and left.

In my opinion, the soup was a bit too salty. Something you would find in most Vietnamese restaurants around anyways, which didn't seem to bother me. The bun bo hu in the other hand was completely off. Not spicy enough and plain. Thai Tea was ok and I sort of enjoyed it. In conclusion, this is a alright place to go if you don't have really high Standards. It's not really expensive and it's open 24/7.",

    "text": "If only no-star rating existed... :-/. despite the reviews, I was optimistic and STARVING post-work in the middle of the night. We walked in and saw one other couple eating, and no one was there to greet or seat us. Finally a worker came out and still he didn't greet or welcome us in a friendly manner... but usually very authentic Asian restaurants can be that way, so that wasn't a huge deal.  After being seated, our waiter stood in front of us watching television... Didn't take our drink order until I asked if they had coconut juice. He said yes and my bf ordered a coke. I was astonished when they brought out a coconut with the wrapping still on it and some kind of sauce smeared on the exterior, and it was only half full... it creeped me out so I didn't drink it, plus they brought out a can of coke, no cup with ice.  I was still hopeful that the food would make up for the odd service... so I ordered the Vietnamese udon with pork and shrimp and my bf ordered the fish porridge. I was overwhelmed with disappointment when they brought over my bowl and I smelled a very unappetizing scent .. I have a very keen sense of taste and smell and something was clearly wrong with the dish.. Whether the pork was going bad or the shrimp.. I couldn't figure it out. I tried squeezing some lime into it and adding hot sauce but that scent wouldn't leave the dish no matter what I did. My bf's dish was too sweet for porridge and the fish was undercooked, plus... It seemed as though the fish wasn't fresh. I took a bite and had to spit it out :(  I think it's time for this restaurant to do some serious evaluating .. service-0, food-1, pricing-2... for its own survival.   Worst part was that no one even checked on us the entire time so they couldn't even tell if we were having a good or miserable experience. They gestured for us to pay at cashier without even coming to the table or looking at us directly.. Rude! Needless to say, we went up, paid the $24, left a tip, and decided never to go there again..",

    "text": "Sigh.  Pho in Las Vegas... how can you go wrong?  Well, let me list the ways:  1) They are so busy and are understaffed for the lunch crowd.  Some of the waiters don't even care about anything.. they just bring your food and leave.    Now, I really don't expect good service from an Asian restaurant, but when we asked for an extra bowl, a waiter shouldn't ignore you and act like they didn't hear your request.  Funny thing is that when we left the restaurant, there are hundreds of empty bowls sitting on the counter!  How hard is it to get an empty bowl from there?  2) The food is average.  I love to eat Pho.  It is such a simple, yet satisfying dish.  Unfortunately, this place is mediocre in their Pho bowls.  Seems like a lot of the other patrons order more rice dishes than Pho.  Which I find interesting, since this is a \"Pho\" restaurant.  3) The spoons and little bowls are greasy and oily.  Nothing is worse than grabbing a spoon and seeing your thumb print embedded into the spoon.  Make sure you wipe the spoon and little bowls!  4) One waiter has a Swastika tattoo on his upper chest and it is SO VISIBLE.  Look, I am all for your 1st amendment right of freedom of speech.  But, dude - don't unbutton your polo shirt so that you can show off that racist Swastika tattoo.  I think most people go here since it is one of the first Pho places on Spring Mountain Road from the strip.  Take my advice and go a little further down and to a better Pho place.",

    "text": "I noticed a bunch of Pho places on Spring during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.  Having partied hardy the night before, our group decided Pho was definitely in order.  Maybe I'm spoiled a bit because I've had the best Pho in San Jose and Westminster... and so my Pho standards are pretty high.  I felt it was an okay place at first glance: clean, lots of Vietnamese locals, and spacious.  The pho was really average. The broth lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some Swanson's chicken broth. I hate that. The noodles were okay, but the meat was TOTALLY skimpy in the large. There are MEATBALLS in Pho Dac Biet, I got no such meat in my bowl and no tripe either =(  I also ordered some Vietnamese Ice Coffee (Cafe Sua Da) and it wasn't strong enough. They skimped on the coffee grounds. I like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred drinks, but they shafted me on the strength. It tasted watered down.  I'd probably never come back unless it were like the AM and I was desperately wasted.  The service kind of sucked too. We were all hungover and needed water. We had to ask 100x times for refills!  This place kind of reminds of the quality and even appearance of Lee's Noodle House in San Jose off of Tully Rd.... If you're from San Jose, you know what I'm talking about - this is Lee's Noodle House twin brother in Vegas.",

We came in around 1:00am and they are open 24 hours. I ordered the pho tai here and I have to say their bowls are pretty big, for sure it's enough to fill you up. As for the pho itself, It was adequate, the broth had a significantly greater amount of MSG compared to other pho places. But the service here was good, we were able to have a good conversation with our server and the other servers greeted us welcomely, joking around with us as well. The sinh to taro here was okay too, although you can tell it was made by using powder (which our server told us about in advance)   Overall: Good service, adequate pho",

She tried to get their attention for 5 mins until another guy finally came and gave her utensils and sauce for her food.

Food, just like the 3 stars I give, reflects the so-so quality of the meal.  The service was very friendly though! Our server joked and flirted with one of us and he just wouldn't stop, quite funny! They were quite prompt at bringing out food but it took them a while to come take our order.  The restaurant was big and it could fit a lot of tables, well at least they seemed to have enough servers to keep the orders moving.   There are so many nice and cheap restaurants in this part of Vegas. I'd say don't waste your time and $$$ here, especially if you didn't win in the casinos.... Good luck with winning!",

Spring rolls- I hate their spring rolls. It doesn't taste fresh and its super dry. Two thumbs DOWN!  Rice dishes- some of them are super salty like pork.. The chicken is good, but other than that, I wouldn't really get it.  This place is just good for their pho.

    "text": "Wasn't going to write a review but after reading a review from 3 days ago about the same ginormous turd in the women's bathroom I knew something had to be said.   First off, I don't really have high expectations when going to eat at a Vietnamese restaurant. I usually eat at Pho Kim Long but around the 2pm hour I did not have time to wait as I was on my hour lunch. Knowing that this place was nearby and I was starving I headed here.   The broth was SUPER watered down. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. It seems as if there is a plumbing problem of some sort because on the women's bathroom door it says to be cautious of water on the floor. Reading that, I walked in and looked at the floor and it wasn't wet, nor recently cleaned. Walking further into the restroom there was a clogged toilet with shit piled to the top (which after reading reviews, has been there nearly 3 days... Who knows how long before that). The next stall was flooded with water which was probably the reason for the sign on the door.   After ordering our food, we asked for extra limes and straws.  As we were about 1/4 way into our meal, we had to ask someone else because nobody came. We see that they are not busy but the workers are running around like a chicken with its head cut off as if they were busy. Where are my straws??? Limes?? Never got those but a straw soon came after asking a 3rd time.   This place is not sanitary, not sure how they are still in business. Definitely won't be coming back on any circumstance. I'd rather wait at Pho Kim and be late to work.",

I had to pay $9.54 and he had to pay over $10. Uhm what?   After a half an hour the other 3 went to go up and pay. One paid 9.18 and the others paid a little over $8.

On our most recent trip to Vegas, we stopped in here with a large group of friends.  For the most part, we were all happy with our orders.  The food was average to above average tasting.  Nothing great.  Although, the food came out fairly fast, the service was not so good.  None of the workers seemed to know how to smile either.  My wife and I were starving so we ordered #15, #72, and #96.  We ordered way too much food because the portions were huge.  If I were rating them on just portion size, they would get 5 stars.   #72 was grilled pork, grilled shrimp, eggroll, and vermicelli.  It came packed with food in a large bowl.  With regards to taste, I'd give it 3 stars cause it was just mediocre.  #96 was chinese broccoli and it was 3.5 stars good.  #15 was my wife's pho order.  She really liked the taste of it and rated it 4 stars.  It was way tastier than Pho Kim Long.  Now, would we return here?  Well, I would definitely choose Pho Little Saigon over Pho Kim Long cause this place is also 24 hours.  Just make sure you bring the cash and do not expect really good customer service.",

Apparently, there's a couple things I name.  1) Staff - A lot of people say the staff is mean or rude... but what do you expect from a place that is running 24/7 and dealing with drunk people all the time? True. I think they could smile a tad more, but my server was just fine. I was a little intimidated by him, but he was plenty responsive.   2) Food - Pretty bland broth. It tastes like regular pho broth, but cut with water. My sister in law said this is the style she's used to eating when she's at her boyfriends. It's more \"homestyle\" I suppose.  3) Cleanliness - I did have a small issue with the cleanliness. Some of the lettuce served was dirty and had some bugs on it. No matter, just pick it off and keep on eating.   Overall, I knew what I was getting into and I wasn't expecting too much out of this place. The food was light and bland but it hit the spot. The meal was cheap and the service was just okay. I probably would come back, but only if I can't find anywhere else to eat at 3:30 AM.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

Bad food late at night is one thing, but I would never choose this place during normal restaurant hours. There are probably 10+ pho restaurants within a 5 minute drive that are not only better quality, but also haven't wound up on the dirty dining list. Here's hoping they can find a way to rise above the competition, because they are my last pick during normal hours, and I am sure others feel the same way.",

If you have roaches crawling around in the daytime I can assure you their's hundreds crawling around at night on the dishes , spoons , glasses , plates and tables.

(even though I asked for the dumplings to come out first) the dumplings wear good .... the broth to the pho had no flavor I had to put way to much of my own seasoning just to make it flavorful they do give you a good amount tho for $9.99 I guess.... probably won't come back service was just to slow for me .... they was nice though ...",

I'd like to start off my very disappointing meal with my family with their PHO. I ordered a Special Pho which comes with a ton of soup and just a bit of meat. The soup tasted a lot of MSG which still lingering my tongue till the next day! The other dishes aren't satisfied and rather disgusting. Along with the meal is their employees and managers customers service which were very bad. My family was 4 adults and 2 kids (around 1-2 yrs old) and they would charged my family as a group of 6 customers with a \"AUTO\" 15% tips on my bill. Yet, when I pay and questioned, they would give me a look and rude attitude even though we spoke the same language. I'd say to all customers who are Vietnamese or not. This place is not a good place to spend your money for a meal. Don't waste you time here!",

The two daughters finished eating and their parents never got their food. A waiter Carried food out and delivered to every corner of the restaurant..how does that even work.   When our future finally came,  it only took us one sip of the soup to know that they used a dirty pot to prepare our soup. A pot, that was just used to prepare a rice dish that I saw come out a few minutes before my food.   Just go eat McDonald's.",

Nothing to write home about but it was OK. During my last visit I decided to try something other than pho, after all Vietnamese food is not limited by its most famous dish in America. Here at Pho Little Siagon, this was a mistake. I ordered a dish from their \"family dinner\" section of the menu with a description that included beef, shrimp and squid. My boyfriend got pho and dumplings, which were brought out quick and left me sitting there hungry and without my dish. When it finally arrived, it was mostly a plate of vegetables with a few pieces if the promised beef, shrimp and squid mixed in a brown sauce. It was basically $13 for something you'd find at a medicore Chinese joint. I'll admit that this was probably my fault for trying something other than pho.   The beef in both my dish and my boyfriend's pho was not fresh and had a slight smell to it. Some of the shrimp had not been cleaned properly and the squid was just plain chewy pieces from the freezer.  As stated in a previous review, they do not give you an itemized bill. Instead they just ring you up and tell you the total. I tried to ask for it but they just handed me my copy of the credit card receipt instead. I gave up and left.   I won't be back.",

Here is the thing. Some of the time it's freshly rolled and mostly it's premade and left in the fridge so that's a minus. My wife always has pho when we eat there. Every time though, it changes. Its amazing at some times but majority it felt as if it was missing a few ingredients. The servers there are pretty old and less enthusiastic and do not check up on you often. I don't like that. I was sitting with an empty cup of water for the longest that I've started to chew away on the ice. That action should be telling them something...",

They forgot 2 of our drink orders 5. Wrong order of both pho bowls 6. Beef in pho was not fresh, not the least bit tender  7. Unsanitary - dirty utensils  8. Charged 15% tips onto the check without telling you or showing you the receipt (we realized we doubled tip the two times we went before)",

The floors were littered with table scraps and even worse, stuck to the chairs and table like it's been uncleaned for days. I felt like I needed a Hep. shot after that meal.  I do agree that the broth was murky but I didn't mind that so much, it was the fact that it smelled rancid and tasted sweet.   No, thank you, Pho Little Saigon.

First of all after eating my food today and had to wash my hand the bathroom is hella dirty hella shit on the floor and never been checked out if someone cleaning this bathroom and then I saw the cook when in the bathroom with the gloves on and aprons on and then left the bathroom with the same gloves and April's on without washing his hand, I'm trying to talk to this guy but this guy didn't speak English. So imagine what they doing behind the scene making you food. Also the waiter and  owner they don't give a fuck how with the customer. They take your order like shit,no respect to you and not listening the order you have to tell them several times before they get you order because they keep interrupting you while you telling them what you want.this people  nothing you will see in any restaurant how this people act. it's really terrible but fuck there customer  service just the food alone how they handle the food it's fucked up already and that the most important of all.if you want to see it if i am telling  I truth go ahead and come to see this restaurant for yourself, and tell me or reply did this review for this restaurant if I'm lying.but me I  will never come back in this restaurant ever ever ever again. Nasty people that's why I threw up after that seeing that shit. On the top of this they automatically take 15% gratitude without telling you and showing you the receipt so you will double the tips this is really fucked up people fuck this restaurant.",

    "text": "Alright so we were hella curious seeing a 24 spot AND it had a good crowd.   Went in and got some mixed meat pho and some pork and eggroll rice plate.   The pho was alright...there was just something missing in the broth flavoring....more sweet, but didn't have that spice and depth the perfect broth should bring forth. Toppings were good, but a bit skimpy compared to some neighboring pho shops.   The rice plate has quite a bit of meat and like 3 eggrolls. It was pretty good. Not bad.   Verdict- skip the soups and maybe do some broken rice if this is our eating option but just some of the reviews make me wary to come back specially since there are other options.   I just read Teri C. review though and it makes me iffy....she's my homegirl Yelper so I trust her. I did not notice they reuse the veggie....okay yeah someones mouth (presumably) hasnt been on it, but for sure someones hands have picked up some sprouts and I don't know where that hand has been. You know I see people not wash their hands in bathrooms that I care to see. It happens a lot and that's not what I want on my soup. I just came from the market and bean sprouts were like 50cents for a huge bag....it's not an expensive produce.   I also observed after sitting there long- the big late night crowd were club people and not sober casino workers like us. Makes a big difference.  I think I pass on this place.",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING ALERT!  We were in Vegas for my husband's conference and some vacation as well. We were there for a week (Monday-Monday). On Friday, we were so tired of the buffets here and there in different hotels so we opted for a Vietnamese food.  Our GPS brought us to this place and since we were all starving we just went in and ordered.  The whole dinner was ok. Food ok. Service ok. We ordered Pho for me,  husband and a friend and fried rice for our 2 kids. My son ate a lot of the fried rice and my hisband ate some. My daughter had about 2 teaspoonfuls.  But lo and behold, when we were driving back to our hotel (after about 3hrs of exploring the strip after dinner) our son started throwing up. He would alternate vomiting and loose bowel movement the whole weekend. he wouldn't take any food or liquids for that matter thus he started becoming dehydrated. My husband started having diarrhea very early saturday. He wasn't able to attend his conference that weekend. My daughter also started having diarrhea saturday morning.   I was worried of my son because he was the most affected of all. I was so close to bringing him to the ER. But husband and our friend are both doctors so we managed their illness.   We immediately concluded that it was the fried rice that caused all these. So sunday afternoon, I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and how they spoil our vacation (our weekend on our trip). I was waiting for the one I spoke with (she said she was the manager) to apologize and sympathize with what we went through the whole weekend. But instead she was so defensive and told me that no one ever complains (indirectly saying that Im making up stories?!). I told her that I jsut dont want it to happen to someone else's family and that they should stop re-heating fried rice (most probably that's what happened) but the lady who can't even speak straight english hung up on me. That got me irrated so I reported them to BBB.  I feel so mad whenever i would think about that weekend! The worst ever plus the fact that I was so scared of my poor little boy. And they don't even care...  Wish I can put a negative rating.",

Perhaps people are confused? This is not the 24 hour Pho in the shopping center, but on the corner across from the center.  Regardless, I'm in Vegas some 50 days a year, and love exploring the off strip restaurants. I had lemongrass tofu, my friend had pho, we shared salad rolls. We loved our food, chuckled at the slightly aloof service at 4:00am, and my friend still makes random comments to me about how incredibly good it was.   In his words, spiced and flavored in a way that exploded his taste buds.  I'll be back, and maybe Briget P. is correct -- maybe they've improved.  Or maybe it's a case of mistaken identity.  Or maybe I got lucky..... \"Croupier: $50 on 00!!\"",

I've been coming here for PHO on Sundays after my vegas trip for the past couple of years and it was not until my trip yesterday did I notice that the quality of their PHO has gone down tremendously.  I ordered the special (#21) and it was just okay. They still served your pho in a big bowl but in my bowl, but in my bowl I did not find too many pieces of meat and I thought the soup was not served hot enough...   I also noticed that they've recently raised the prices on their pho. What the pho? Sigh. I was so disappointed. I guess all good things must come to an end.

    "text": "Wow... reading all the reviews, I'm quite surprised.  This place is open 24 Hours! It can't get any better than that if you have a very late craving for Vietnamese food.  My cousin and I were out gambling in the late night and were craving for food. We were at T.I. (Treasure Island) walking around looking for a decent table to play at when we passed the \"Pho\" restaurant they have inside. We walked in and they were serving breakfast only, American style. All I can think about is WTF??  Still craving that pho after a night of gambling, we decided to hit Spring Mountain and found this place.  Best choice ever. There were a lot of people at this restaurant for being after lunch (3pm). Service was fast and attentive.  I had the pho tai nam gan. The bowl was big and reasonably priced. I typically would finish a large bowl but this time, I couldn't even do it. It was on par with some of the pho I have back home but this place is up there in my book.  The eggrolls were awesome! Just like how mom makes it. It was perfect. It was still nice and hot while it sat there, waiting for me to finish my pho.  I tried some of my kid brother's bun thit nuong cha gio, and this was really good also. I actually came back 12hours later for this. It was worth it.  I would recommend this place if you have a craving for pho!  $65 for 7 people... not bad.",

    "text": "Stay away.  That's all I can really say.  My mistake was not reading all the other yelp reviews before trying this place, otherwise I would have just said no.  Looks can be deceiving and this place is pretty busy with large parties taking over the tables.  Not only is there a regular menu, but if you look around, you'll see pictures with numbers posted on the wall.  Good luck trying to find out what they are because they are listed on the menu and there's no pricing.  When we asked a waitress about a particular picture on the wall, all she could really say about it was that it was fish.  (Uh, we could tell that it was fish, we wanted to know what kind of sauce or how it was cooked!)  In the beginning, the wait staff was on us to order but since we were taking so long, it's as if we were forgotten.  (How could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us?)  After passing on their expensive pho ($6.99 to $7.99), I chose the Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam style chicken with seasoned rice) for $8.99.  Initially, I had seen an entree version of this dish and was going to inquire about it, but since I wanted the seasoned rice, I chose to go with this option.  The Big F is a big fan of Com Bo Kho (Beef stew with steamed rice) for $7.99, but usually sees it served with a French roll instead of rice.    As we waited for our food to arrive, the wait staff at a nearby table was attracting my attention.  Although I couldn't hear what they were saying, their actions were speaking louder than their words.  They were talking about clearing a table and apparently the previous diners left their barely touched strawberry shake on the table.  I'm not sure what the busboy did with that shake, but he sure didn't toss it into the garbage right away like he should have.  What really bothered us was the plate of pho garnishes that were returned to the kitchen for further use.  (How do I know he did that?  Well, he had a cleaning cart with a garbage can attached to it and he dumped all the other garbage in there.  But he made a point of taking that plate of garnishes and bringing it back to the kitchen.  That looks suspicious to me.)  When my plate of Hainamese chicken arrived, it looked awful.  (Check the photos out for yourself!)  First off, it looked like leftover chicken all thrown on a plate and covered with scallions, ginger, and cilantro so I couldn't see the banged up chicken underneath.  And there was no skin left on my chicken!  Part of the dish is the tasty skin, and it looked like they gave me the healthy version!  Once I got past how little chicken I got, I noticed something else was wrong.  Uh, where is my seasoned rice?  There's a huge ball of white steamed rice on my plate and the seasoned rice is half the dish!  When I asked the waiter about it, he said they ran out of the seasoned rice.  When I explained that was why I ordered the dish, he went to the back to the kitchen.  He came back reaffirming that they did indeed run out of seasoned rice and he would give me a discount on the dish.  I was hungry, so I ate what I had in front of me.  It was far from special.  The Big F's beef stew was just okay, and he's had a lot of the stew in other places.  He was initially turned off because it didn't have the same color that he was used to.  He pointed out that there was a lot of MSG in it too.  I also saw him pour soy sauce in it, so I knew that it was not hitting his taste buds.  When we went up to pay, I noticed they didn't give me any discount.  I had to ask the waiter about it, and he took $2 off the total bill.  (At least he did that!)  In the end, bad food with average service and suspicious kitchen practices.  Although they offered a few unique family dinner options, you won't see us walking through these doors again any time soon.  Keep on driving, there are plenty of other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain.  Cash only.  Update: After posting this review, someone contacted me saying their wife worked here part-time.  He mentioned that they do not resell the smoothies, but they do reuse the pho condiments since they are a bit expensive.  The last I checked, bean sprouts and limes were not expensive.",

    "text": "I've never been ignored at a restaurant until now. Pho Little Saigon, thank you for devirginizing me into the world of horrendous customer service and food.   My friends and I all had a craving for some authentic Asian food, so we decided to wander away from the strip and into this area of Las Vegas. At first glance, it looked like a promising decision. How wrong we were.   As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were promptly seated at tables that still needed to be cleaned. Chairs were soaked with broth from the Pho and spilled condiments littered the table top. We wouldn't have minded if there were some napkins on the table for us to clean it up ourselves, but none were there. And when we tried to wave down the waiter/host/whatever he was to get us a few, he looked directly at our table and ignored our requests.    That should have been our first que to leave. But we decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. So we put in our orders for water, drinks, and food. Easy enough.   20 minutes pass. No water. None of our drinks are on our table. And my friend gets her watered down porridge.   20 more minutes. Still no water. My friend is trying to be polite and wait for us to get our food before she starts eating but we tell her to just go ahead.   20 minutes later. Water arrives. And my food gets there.   10 minutes later, the rest of the food gets there. But none of our drinks.   Food is below average. My brother didn't eat his, and he loves this stuff (even if it is horrible. I've never seen him not finish or even attempt to eat his pho).   The bill comes. No drinks. Our order of eggrolls also never came out. We tell them about this, and how we don't even want our drinks anymore, but they charge us anyway. So we wait for the drinks.   They arrive ten minutes after we pay the bill (which still included the order of invisible eggrolls), mixed up, without boba, and sloppy.   Everyone is better off just hitting a buffet and going to the Asian section if they have a craving for some noodles.   Pho Little Saigon, never again.",

    "text": "It's 5am...I've spent the night playing cards on the strip, I'm a little tipsy, and really hungry...where should I go.  I've done the Steak and Egg cafe specials too many times...How about something on the way home. So my friend and I head down spring mtn looking for some food.  We pass a few places that are getting ready to close and a few others that are open, but empty, then we come across Pho Little Saigon.  We walk in and are greeted fairly quickly, I check out the menu, I've had Pho before, but I'm not 100% sure what all the stuff on the menu was, I settle on #38 I think, Fatty Brisket and Noodles.  The food was out in no time, the broth was solid, the meat was good, and the noodles hit the spot.   My only major complaints was all the extra crap in the bowl, I'm not a fan of red or greeen onions. And there was only 1 waiter so my water glass never got refilled.  I will say it was good and cheap, and a nice alternative to the casino cafe or denny's at 5am. I will be going back and exploring their expansive menu.",

    "text": "My first one star review ever.  This place is nastiness.  I've been to this pho restaurant several years ago and didn't remember it being so bad.  We walked in to a bunch of empty tables still with dirty dishes on them, we'll let that go.  Then, we get seated at a table and the waiter sloppily wiped the table, there was still grease all over it.  Now I start feeling dirty.  My husband and I both order pho and just one drink.  His pho came out first...and that was the only thing that ever came out.  I sat there and watched him eat.  I never got my pho or the drink we ordered.  I got out of there as quickly as I could and was actually glad that I never had to eat after reading the yelp reviews about roaches inside the pho!!  Gross!!  This place made me feel dirty!!  There are too many pho selections in LV that no one needs to tolerate this in order to get a good pho fixing.  Pass this place by and keep rolling down spring mountain!!",

    "text": "This is the first Pho place you'll see if you're driving off the 15 and into \"Chinatown.\" I had just spent an hour driving around to restaurants that for some reason were either CLOSED or reserved for private parties. We were starving and decided the FIRST place we saw on Spring Mountain for noodles we saw, was where we'd eat.  The service was friendly but the restaurant Falsely advertises CORONA in the window. Don't expect to get a beer here. They don't have their liquor license. Apparently they forgot to renew it. (?!)  The bowls of pho were large but for $6.99 you'd sure hope so. The rare beef was okay. Quality wise, I've had better. The eye of round in the bowl was disappointingly fatty.  We also had a bowl of cold noodles, lettuce and shrimp paste/ soybean wrapper fritters with slices of pork. The dish was pretty bland and the pork was overcooked.  We also ordered another dish that was more like a chinese stirfry of beef and veggies over little patties of fried noodles. It was okay but not good enough that we'd want to take the leftovers home.  In the end, it was a fair visit since the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. The place is brightly lit and relatively clean. I'd imagine this would be a good place for big groups of hungry, last minute eaters.",

The big downer for eating here is the waitstaff that doesn't speak English, and has a way of telling you off when they misunderstand you.  I'm very polite, so it's a bit of a surprise when I get my head bitten off when I try to order spring rolls... which didn't come, but they magically showed up on my bill.  WTF?  Cash only.",
