Traveling the way we do we have had the pro ledge of enjoying many different foods and dining experiences in all sorts of places. Sunrise diner always provided the best service. The people here have been working together a long time and are in very good sync with each other and handling there customers. Doesn't matter how busy they get customers are always treated quickly and friendly and seated ASAP. Also the pay attention to customers needs beyond food. One day just after being seated it began to sink in how cold it was in the diner. Almost shaking at this point, I didn't even have to begin to make the effort to ask before 3 different people came over to let me know something was being done about the air. Sunrise diner just goest above and beyond for all their customers...  AND THE FOOD! Ugh! Just as good as the service. Delicious fluffy omelets made anyway you want it. The menus is a good size and doesn't have 1 bad thing on it. I wish I was a local so I could have more time to try more of their food. One of the best!",

Reason I gave this place 5 stars is because even though we came here during their busiest time of the day all their staff was very much on point, friendly and always there right when I needed more coffee or just had a question about the menu.",

I highly recommend the corn beef and hash. Ask them for extra crispy. It'll be an extra 10 mins wait, but let me till you. It's worth the wait big time. And I get my eggs poached or scrambled. And of course either an egg bagel or sourdough toast. And heads up the staff is super friendly. Coolest part is the actual owner is hands on too. You see him cooking on the line. And then coming out to great the guest too. One of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. And FYI....these folks have crunch berry version of French toast! So do yourself a favor and go check place out.",

Since my last review, the service continues to excel, the food is above average and overall, we enjoy the experience.  Slight ding - seems like the hash brown servings ( and they make very good hash browns ) are shrinking.  I continue to order Jacobs  Slammin' Platter ( two eggs, slice of Canadian ham, bacon, sausage, 4-5 dollar pancakes, hash browns and bread with no charge option of a bagel ) three out of four visits.  The gf orders her egg white veggie omelet EVERY TIME.  Her dings - occasionally they put onions in the omelet even though she orders without.  She prefers a mixed fruit option instead of their banana slice only option.  We will continue to visit OSC.  attached pic of the slamming platter",

The waiter did not crack a single smile. I'm sorry, did my presence offend you? I tried to be nice and smile, but he wouldn't even make eye contact with us. He would walk by, ask a surly question, and stalk off.   Now, look. I know, it was 7am. I'm not always a morning person, either. I get it. But if I'm working with the public you'd better believe I put on a morning person act. Especially since I, too, work for tips. I feel your pain, buddy... I do. But you're still a douche for treating nice customers like that. I brought a friend here because I'd had okay experiences before. I bet he will never trust my judgment again.  Our plates were brought out by a lady who had just walked in the door. Not sure if those mitts were washed before she touched them. That's neither here nor there. At least she was nearly friendly?

He was super appreciative, helped us move with our drinks to a waiting area, put our names on the waiting list again and then got us refills. While we waited another lady came by and offered us blueberry muffin samples. When our family arrived, the hostess immediately came over to let us know the next table would be ours. Our new waiter was just as friendly. In fact, it should be noted EVERYONE in this place was nice and accommodating, even the bus boys. Very rare and such a refreshing change in this town. Lots of food choices. Our group had Brooklyn eggs Benedict, an omelette, a burger and a lox bagel sandwich thing. The food was all amazing...tasty, hot and prompt. I really really wanted one of their fabulous French toast creations but made a more reasonable choice...maybe next time lol anyway, we will definitely be back next time we are in town..I can't say enough great things about this place!!!",

From Costa Rica cheers! Great experience, excellent service, great food, clean place and affordable",

I had a cheese omelet that was accompanied by some very flavorful and well seasoned hash browns. A cut above the usual fare. The bagel that came with my order had REAL cream cheese on it. My wife's bagel plate included some very good lox. Even the coffee was good. Service is extremely attentive and friendly. This will be a regular stop for us. No bar service. So no Bloody Mary for me",

The coffee was delicious.  I ordered a Ranchero wrap. Very simple ingredients and each bite had the right amount of everything so  I didn't get a mouthful of salsa followed by a hunk of cheese, everything in every bite as a wrap should be. Their house style potatoes were perfectly cooked, mostly tender pieces and a few nice crunches pieces. No exotic overwhelming spices, just the taste of the food, like a good home cooked meal - appropriate for a family diner style restaurant like this.  I was more than just pleased with the music they had playing, I was overjoyed. I felt immediately at home. Even though I have a job and live in LA, I was tempted to ask if they were hiring because I wanted to be a part of the fun. Great experience and I'll do it again!",

The best breakfast I've had in Las Vegas without a doubt. The signature 'snow caps' were amazing. Basically bites of bagel, deep fried, served with cinnamon and sugar, a side of blueberry sauce and cream cheese icing. They're nothing short of phenomenal.  I also went with the banana fosters pancakes I believe. They were SO good.   My mom went with one of the Benedict's and said it was absolutely one of the best she's ever had.   We went on a Saturday around 1130 and waited 15 minutes or so for a table for 4.   One of the biggest things I took away from OSC was the GREAT service. We had interaction with not only our waiter but 3 other employees who visited the table and ALL were beyond friendly. I'm big on customer service so this was huge for me.   I cannot wait to go back!",

My only problem was that their bacon was THE WORST bacon I've EVER had, it tasted like the cheapest quality they could possibly find and it cost me 3 extra dollars to add on. I actually prefer McDonald's sad excuse for bacon. With the omlette we asked to replace the potatoes and toast with only cottage cheese, (a fair trade) the waiter said \"SURE NO PROBLEM!\" We were pleased with this answer and proceeded to happily eat and avoid the bacon. Then we got the check and  were CHARGED for the replacement cottage cheese, so that's bad business. Also very overpriced for basic breakfast items, I can't say I'll be back in this case.",

It was a pleasant wait, and we were offered a piece of blueberry bread and ice water, as it was 108 degrees this day.   Everyone working here was extremely friendly and pleasant, even though every single seat was full. We each ordered a Regular Eggs Benedict, but replaced the Canadian bacon with regular, crispy bacon. The benedicts were served on open faced bagels. These were a little harder to cut, but the flavor was good.   The hollandaise sauce was good, not spectacular, but pretty tasty. The bacon was sort of underwhelming. It was sort of thin and not really crispy. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good though. They were rather thickly shredded, and were fairly crispy.   It was SO loud in here. Had to sort of yell across the table. It would not have been a good time to be with a big group, as no one would be able to hear each other. But the food and service were both good.",

I ordered the French Toast with the nuts on top, and made it a combo with scrambled eggs and bacon (for my little one. I don't eat bacon). The French Toast was tasty. The eggs were bland, and the bacon was limp. The French Toast made the meal good though.  Our server was not friendly at all. I made a joke about how Mr. Pibb doesn't taste the same as Dr Pepper (this restaurant serves Mr. Pibb), and he stated rudely that they are the same. He was very dry and unwelcoming. So I'm deducting a star. Service is very important to me.   Price is pretty standard. It was crowded for being a Thursday morning, but we did get right in. I can't imagine what it's like on weekends. I'll probably go back to try some new things.",

On Sunday mornings, parking can be VERY tedious, but if you're lucky enough to find some close to the restaurant, generally you wait around 10 minutes (if you're lucky) on a Sunday morning to get some eggs! However, I can honestly say that I've waited 20 minutes before but they usually surpass the time they give and deliver even earlier.  This place knows how to make a good eggs Benedict. I love my eggs Benny's, and Sunrise Cafe does a great job of satisfying my craving whenever I want one.   The service is really friendly and you can see how they all walk with a pep in their step!

Two male employees continued to loudly argue and cuss at each other and twice other employees had to step in and separate them. I understand jobs can be stressful, but when someone is paying for a meal and a nice experience, you don't argue and cuss repeatedly directly in-front if paying customers. We waited for a manager to step in, but apparently they don't have those here. We were very uncomfortable eating here, which made me sad due to I had been looking forward to it.",

If you don't mind sitting up at the counter you can usually be seated quicker. They have a HUGE menu of everything breakfast. I tried the Cajun prime rib Bennie and couldn't have been happier. It features scrambled eggs and sauteed mushrooms on top of buttered garlic toast with shaved prime rib and topped with a Cajun hollandaise sauce. Phenomenal! Our waiter suggested getting the eggs poached which is the traditional style of eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The hashbrowns were cut thick and buttered and had that crisp layer on top I love. Our coffee never got below half full before our waiter was around to refill it. They were slammed but we got our food quickly. This is the way you do breakfast. Thank you Sunrise Cafe!",

    "text": "This review is for breakfast solo dining on a weekday. I sit outside if the weather is nice, at a table inside if it's not, or at the counter if it's really crowded. This place is consistently welcoming and I know I will get a satisfying meal each time. Service is quick and the friendly staff is attentive with coffee and water refills.   I usually get the same things, but looking at the other pictures, I need to branch out a bit! I get either the traditional French toast, the Plainview Diner or the Californian. The last two are egg white omelettes. If I feel like going meatless, I go for the Plainview with spinach, garlic and feta cheese. The Californian has turkey, the usual veggies of mushrooms, onions, spinach and topped with - and here's the CA part - avocados, tomatoes and jack cheese. The French toast is pretty standard. I guess that's why I like it! It's not trying to be something that it's not :)   Love the family feel of the place and I'm so pleased to see they are busy whenever I stop in...but never too busy to give great service!",

We arrived at 9am on a Saturday and it was a 30 minute wait and there was no where to stand and wait inside; however, there was no wait to eat outside so that's were we went (it was so windy and cold though so that's why no one was out there!). Waitress was attentive and food was quick. Started with coffee with a choice of original or butterscotch. I opted for the butterscotch and it was amazing. I would return just for the coffee. I got the bread pudding pancakes which tasted exactly like bread pudding. They were delicious. My husband had the Cajun prime rib beni and enjoyed every bite. The hash browns were good also. We got an order of snow caps and the grilled muffin of the day to go for family. The snow caps are good...but it's just like a fried bagel cut up with powdered sugar? I mean they are fine but nothing special. The muffin was delicious. All in all, we enjoyed it. Don't forget to order the butterscotch coffee!",

I ordered their dazevilla omelet and forgot to mention that I didn't want cheese. When the food came, I scraped off the cheese to the side and the waitress recognized it right the way and asking whether the food is okay. She continued to make sure we were enjoying our food and refilling the coffee. The service was excellent. Also, the food was amazing too. I love the omelet was are with egg whites only and it was lightly seasoned. The hash browns was also great with light butter.  I really enjoyed my brunch there and wanted to recommend other to try as well.",

I have never gone at a peak time before on a weekend morning so I called to see how long the wait was.  They said about a half hour and I asked if it was possible to be put on the list over the phone since I'm driving there now.  The girl ln the phone said yes and took my name.  I was super excited about it.  When we got there I talked to the outdoor hostess and she said, with attitude, \"well your time starts from check in\" basically implying calling ahead was pointless.  I said I wished they had told me that on the phone and she said, also with attitude, \"that's why it's called 'call ahead\" whatever that means.  I said some mean things under my breath which I'm not proud of and we left.  I can handle the wait but i cannot handle the attitude when I'm trying to treat my friend to a nice breakfast.",

The menu features a variety of breakfast and lunch specialities - I opted for breakfast and chose Jacob's platter. It didn't take very long for our food to come out. Everything was hot and good, especially the potatoes. I would be completely content with a plate of cheese potatoes. I did taste their homemade turkey sausage, which is pretty awesome. They were pretty successful in making turkey taste just as good as pork - actually better.   Service was excellent and prices were great.

    "text": "This place is packed, but I was really impressed by their friendly hostess and wait staff, and their quick quick service! There were a lot of people waiting in front of us, and I thought we were in for a long wait, but the hostess asked us if we were ok with counter seating, and we were, so we literally glanced at the menu and our name was called.  Counter seating is a bit tight if you're a bigger person, just FYI.  We had a craving for eggs Benedict, but noticed this place does it on bagels, not English muffins. This was almost a deal breaker,but I'm glad we didn't leave and just stuck around and ate here. We ended up getting the LEO sandwich on a kaiser roll. LEO is lox,egg, onion. The lox is lightly cooked, so it doesn't have the regular raw texture to it like I'm used to. But this was good. It was perfectly cooked so it was soft still, the eggs fluffy, and the onions translucent but not caramelized. IMO perfect. The kaiser roll was topped with poppy seeds and very soft as well, and the cream cheese was generous. The potatoes it came with were better than the Doritos flavored ones from Egg and I. These were more like hash browns, and were really good with the lime and chili Franks Redhot sauce they have there.  We also got the prime rib eggs beni. It's on a roll also, with thinly cut prime rib, with grilled onions, cheese, and scrambled egg topped with hollandaise sauce. It's like a Philly cheese steak with egg.  Very good! The beef was very tender, and I didn't see any traces of fat. This also came with potatoes, but you can also opt for fruit, I think bananas.  Service like I said was so fast it shocked me. From the time we entered till we got our food was probably no more than 15 mins. Coffee was refilled quickly too. People do tend to camp out here even after they are done eating, but the staff still refill their coffee and don't rush people out. Personally I hate when people do that, ESP if there are a lot of people waiting, i think its rude. But we scarfed down our food and were happily on our way.  The only reason this place didn't get five stars from me is its a bit on the pricey side for breakfast. Hopefully I can come back sometime soon and try lunch. Btw they are only open until 3pm.",

    "text": "Wife and I were in town for a late weekend getaway and found The OSC on Yelp with fantastic reviews (and a lot of them). Arrived around 10-ish on a Sunday, so expected a crowd and was not let down. Parking in front was full, however, there was plenty of parking around the side of the building. Hostess was kind and attentive-took our names and estimated a 25-minute wait for first available (outside, bar, or table), which I thought was pretty fast given the crowd waiting outside. We grabbed a cup of coffee next door and found a couple of shaded seats while we waited. Our Hostess nailed the wait time - we were happy and surprised and gladly accepted two seats at the bar. The full crowd inside made for a very loud diner, and sitting at the bar exposed us to the hustle of staff serving, cleaning, answering phones, and closing out checks. A quieter mid-morning Sunday breakfast/brunch experience is most likely outside, but we had no issues at all with the noise level or energy while at the bar. Matthew was our server, and was fantastic. Even though the place was packed, there was no rush at all. We ordered 2 waters (already had drinks ordered during the wait), and 2 Jacob's Slammin' Platters. Order to service took about 10 minutes, and orders were correctly served. Food was good. The Platter comes with 2 eggs, sausage, bacon, Canadian bacon, hash browns, 4 silver dollar pancakes, and toast. A healthy serving of food for under $10. The meal tasted good, eggs were cooked to order, and the meats, toast and pancakes were all very good. Personally, I thought the pancake batter was delicious. We finished our plates, Matthew topped off our drinks several times, and explained there was no rush to pay when he dropped off the check (keep in mind, mid-morning breakfast rush on Sunday, with a healthy que waiting for tables). From check-in to payment we spent about an hour to an hour and 15 min at OSC. Needless to say, we had a good experience and recommend anyone in the area to give OSC a shot, we did, and were not disappointed.",

I had the morning wrap with sausage and American cheese. It was soooo delicious. I ate it all super fast, lol. My husband had the 215 sandwich! He also enjoyed it very much. The potatoes it came with we're yummy! My son had the Mickey mouse pancakes. They were super cute and yummy as well (I stole a bite, lol).   Overall, I will definitely be back to try something else on their large menu. My husband says everything he's tried has been excellent! Great place! Try it out!",

I'm not super close to The Original Sunrise Cafe, so it probably won't be a regular place for me, but if I'm back in the area for breakfast again sometime I'll definitely stop back in.

Most importantly, the food is delicious! I have literally fallen in love with Jacobs slamming platter. It is for those who simply cannot decide. For some, like myself, you don't want to give up your buttered toast and potatoes for a side of pancakes. With the platter, you get it all! Yay! I often want just a few bites of yummy pancakes and not an entire sugar loaded breakfast. Sunrise gives you 4 perfect little silver dollar pancakes to curb your sweet cravings without sending you into an AM diabetic coma!  Other winners include the omelets with tasty additions such as creamy garlic sauce and sliced avocado. Corned beef hash is good stuff as well.  All in all, a 5 star breakfast you'll return to over and over again.",

After driving around forever 20 mins was fine! What was great was the hostess kept us updated on what was going on! Then we were called and seated and the service just got even better! Marney (Marnie) was on top of her game! Our drinks were on their way before we even had a chance to ask for more!

Today,  we checked out at our hotel in The Strip and came right back here for our brunch - yes,  we skipped all those famous brunch spots at The Strip to eat here.   There's even a sign in the OSC that says \"God lives at Sunrise Cafe\".  I don't doubt that - the coffee was heaven.  The service here is also warm - friendly staff. They take care of you so well.

I was waiting for my boyfriend to get out of surgery and was basically strong armed into eating here since it was the only place open at 7AM that wasn't a bar or a chain restaurant.   Typical breakfast menu omelettes, the sweet stuff, the skillets, the eggs benedicts, the works.   They serve their eggs benedicts on bagels (my super palate can detect the get their bagels from Great Buns Bakery) and have a variety of toppings. I didn't see any with turkey bacon or turkey sausage on any of the menu items, so I asked, and the waitress said yes, but for an additional charge. I 100% understand the need to charge more for something that is more expensive, but when I'm just swapping something it's annoying to be charged for trying to go for the healthier option.   The food itself was standard. I was a little turned off by the turkey bacon since it looked a little gray. I picked it off and just ate the rest. I feel like all breakfast places are pretty similar when it comes to eggs, hash browns, & the rest of the goods. The hollandaise was okay I wish there was more. No complaints about service but it wasn't too welcoming either. This is my second time here, and it's not a place I'll visit again--unless I'm waiting for someone in surgery at 7AM.",

A large is very large and lasted all meal. I have the omelette with sausage peppers onions and cheddar cheese Was a nice size and cooked perfectly. The sunrise potatoes were the real star of the day. Crispy hash browns served nice and flat. Was so good I ate every bit. Ordered a side of bacon and it was crisp and delicious. Since I can't have gluten they gave me a side of banana and it was really good, firm and no brown spots. Everything was reasonably priced and I'll definitely be back",

    "text": "This was my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. Every time I was in town I would take my team of 8 and we would eat here because we loved the food and service. It was a tradition for us and I always looked forward to it. We recently came here on a Thursday and the food and speed of it coming was good. We were waiting on one person who wasn't able to make it, and we were talking for about 20-30 mins after we ate and we were just hanging out. Usually one of us picks up the tab, and after sitting for that long apparently we didn't receive the bill. We walked outside and were talking and the Server Matt came outside and rudely let us know that we didn't pay and what that means. I apologized and gave him my card to pay. He processed the bill and came out and again was obviously angry and treated us with disrespect. We all looked at each other and were like WOW! I understand that we accidentally didn't pay, but I would think the server could bring the bill if we're talking for 20-30 mins after we were done eating. We still apologized and paid and he was obviously upset. Even when he took our order, it was border line rude where he reads through the options like a robot. I love the food and love the atmosphere. But as long as Matt is there we will never go back. Hopefully this is addressed and customers who make a mistake and have been loyal will not be treated this way any more. After posting this I went through and found another complaint on Matt. All it takes is one of these at a time. Please don't take your customers for granted and think they will just always come. I was also a loyal customer, but not any more.",

It's a plus that they're dog friendly!  You are able to call them ahead of time to add your name on the list. Be prepared to wait since this place is always busy! They are able to turn tables around quickly though so we probably only waited 10 minutes max.   Service and food are always great! I usually order my go to but I finally tried their Cajun Prime Rib Beni and OMG it was delicious! They give your pup an ice water bowl and treats while you're dining, cute touch. Will definitely be ordering that again when we go back.",

The only thing that wasn't perfect (for me anyway) stems from the fact that the place is on Eastern, facing the rising sun, hence the name I guess. We got there when they opened at 7am (after work) and every booth and table I saw was completely bathed in blinding sunlight, and there are no curtains or blinds to be found on the windows. It's kind of a trivial thing to complain about, but it's hard to pay attention to your food or your breakfast companion when you're squinting from the blazing sunlight.  That aside, the place is solid and a great choice for breakfast - try the \"Peter Brady\", you'll thank me for it!",

Kind of puzzling as I was one of the only patrons there and the Sunday brunch rush was obviously over.  When my Ultimate French toast platter (about $14) finally showed up, it definitely wasn't as \"ultimate\" as I'd expected, but still decent breakfast food.  I live right up the street from this place and always pass by, so I'm glad I finally popped in to cross it off my list. Not sure if I'll be back as the value just isn't really there.

Overall the staff was friendly, food was just ok, and service was pretty slow.   The food was only warm, not hot, the plate presenting was not appealing and lacked flavor.   I had coffee and refills were never offered and had to be asked for each and every time. Mom got tea, first time the water was hot, when the refill came the water was barely warm. When asked for a new cup with hot water, they obliged and charged for another cup of tea.  In the end we spoke with the manager and got a credit for 1 tea, but not without a \"well just this once\" attitude.  May try another time because it is a dog friendly place, but would not return for the service or food.",

    "text": "So i came here with my fam bam on a Saturday around 11:00AM and we waited for about 5 minutes for a half booth (not bad!)  I ordered the eggs benedict with sausage and jalapenos, my hubby had a stack of pancakes.    Let me start with the pancakes:  They were a good size about the size of a medium dinner plate.  One of the pancake seemed a little over cooked as the outside was a bit darker then the other two and a little tougher.  The give a small amount of syrup but you can always ask for more.  Eggs benedict:  The hollandaise was just so so meaning it was light but too buttery and needed a little kick (maybe a hint of fresh lemon juice).  There was nothing special about the sausage just your typical sausage patty.  The touch of jalapenos was good; however it was drenched in jalapenos so it over powered everything else.  The eggs were perfectly poached and everything was served on top of an original bagel.  I've had eggs benedict on a traditional english muffin, croissant, and even hawaiian bread and I have to admit having it on a bagel is not something I particularly care for.  It is just too much.    As for the potatoes: they're hash brown style cut a little thicker then your traditional hash browns.  Their grilled to a crisp on the outside and soft to the bite.  Made with lotsa butter though that's why it tasted so good.  At the end of our meal they gave my 4 year old a pick at their treasure chest and that made him happy.  I would come back and maybe try something different.  So, just A-ok for now...maybe will get a better  rating next time.",

With ingredients like this it seems to me that Vegas is growing up. We were in and out in a half hour allowing us to stay ahead of the traffic.

The sliced option would make it easier to cut without having to worry about escaping chunks of turkey.

I ate the Fiest Benedict - which had a toasted bagel, basted egg (perfectly cooked), Jalapeno Bacon, and pepper jack cheese. It was coated with a spicy hollandaise sauce, that was simply devine. The best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. Very unique. I loved it. Even the potatoes had great flavor and crispness.   My friend had the coolest Banana Cream Pie Pancakes... banana syrup, bananas on top, and dulce de leche whipped butter!!! YUMMMM. Comes with 3 cakes. The coolest thing by far was the Jalapeno Bacon! Excellent flavor, worth the money to have a taste of this. Several pieces to a side, so it's a good value.   The place was very busy, as it was Sunday morning, but we still managed to get a table inside right away. There is also patio seating, breakfast bar seating, tables or booths. Bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. Server was very nice and very prompt. When should couldn't make it over, she sent a runner. So our drinks, food, and general needs were quickly attended to.   I don't know why anyone would eat at IHOP or Denny's with this little gem just down the road on Eastern & 215. Overall great place. Could totally make this a Sunday habit. :)",

A week ago from today I came in with two of my friends for breakfast midway through our meal I bit down into a ROCK.. Yes, a ROCK in my food. After biting down on it and chipping my molar.. I was in shock and notified my server. My server told me that he would grab the Manager which is proper protocol in situations like this. So the manager comes to the table and from the start approached the situation with a mild attitude \" I talked to the chef and he said there was and is NO WAY that could have got in your food\" insinuating as if I were lying. Then she proceeded to tell me \"Well I'm sorry about that but there is nothing I can do\" after a few seconds of standing there awkwardly shrugging like she didn't know what to tell us, she took the rock and walked away. We were all stunned. Not sure what kind of experience she has as a manager but that is an inexcusable way for you treat any customer that just broke a tooth (which is now constantly sensitive) on a rock that was in their food in their establishment. We all immediately stopped eating (not even halfway through finishing our meals), paid our bill, and left upset. I hope they sharpen up their customer service, and something like this never happens to another paying customer ever again.",

We love the breakfast at this place, and although it's been packed whenever we come, we never have to wait too long for a table. We've come with a group as big as 7, and with just the 2 of us as well, and the wait was short both times.   I love the Chester's Way corned beef hash, and my husband gets the French Toast platter. They are delish! If I didn't love the Chester's Way so much I'd probably try something else, but for now I'll stick to the classics.   Definitely recommend for a weekend late breakfast spot away from the crazy buffets.",

It's nothing special, i would much rather go to the Starbucks in the shopping center and then come have breakfast.  In my opinion, the coffee you serve at a breakfast joint is pretty important.    Despite the coffee, this is my FAVORITE breakfast joint!  They need to add another location in the Southwest area!!",

The food was really good and not too expensive.  The kids even got to pick a prize from a little bucket that was offered with the check!  The kids loved that and loved their Mickey Mouse shaped silver dollar pancakes.  I am from NJ & this is the 1st place I have found that reminded me of the independent breakfast/lunch places that I have worked at back East.  We will definitely be returning!! Thanks Sunriise!",

Place had a great family friendly atmosphere. We were seated right away but it did take a while for the food to be served.  We love a good eggs benedict and they have several varieties. We got the plain one just to get a feel of what the food is like... without modifications. Nicely poached eggs, Canadian bacon, served on a bagel, with good hollandaise sauce. Overall slightly above average.   The star of the meal was the banana pancake infused with banana, topped with fresh banana slices and generously smothered with walnuts. Perfect balance was achieved by adding syrup and the dulce de leche butter, which was unique and just delicious!  The meal for two, with fresh OJ and coffee, cost approximately $25. We will definitely be back to try their offerings.",

The potato salad was also pre made probably the standard from U S Foods. Will give it another try sometime.",

I see a lot of so-so experiences and I can see why...it can get quite busy especially in the morning on weekends. I'm not making an excuse for them and maybe they need to improve staffing on the weekends, but I believe you as customer should also speak up, instead of sitting there pissed off. Let yourself be heard, those guys running around are there for you...flag them down-you're allowed that. As a business i'm sure they are open to constructive criticism.   You can't miss the place. They are on Eastern across from Moon Nursery. They are in the same lot as Yogurtland,  LVAC, Pho Saigon, and Starbucks. Plus you will see their bright orange SUNRISE on the building.  The inside is big and clean. They have inside and outside seatings. If you have a large party, just call ahead and they will accommodate you. There is also have a breakfast bar towards the back of the restaurant if you don't want to sit at a table.  We wished that they would open earlier but their hours are 7am to 3pm everyday. We come here so much that we don't look at the menu. We get seated and just order...it makes it easier for our server. We order the Traditional Sunrise with eggs & canadian bacon. Its a Sourdough french toast with banana's, maple syrup, & granola- It's ONO! They also have good fluffy blueberry pancakes. The banana cream pie pancakes are disgustingly good...it's a big order, enough to share with someone. The kids go for the ham and cheese omelette- it is what it is and the kids love it. If it wasn't good, trust me, they would say so. I've had the Dave-zilla- egg whites, spinach, sausage, & cheese. It's enough to fill you up without weighing you down. And when Im watching my girlish figure (usually before the winter holiday parties) I order it w/out cheese. We've also tried the Power Wrap-grilled chix, egg whites, & salsa, and the steak and egg wrap, both are very good. They also have salads (you can create your own), all kinds of wraps (breakfast, lunch, and healthy), burgers, and specialty sandwiches. They serve Shangri La iced T which is always a plus for us...the common lipton iced tea is nasty. You can also buy the Tea from them, as well as other stuff like, candy, protein shakes, and other drinks that they sell in their drinks display.  We haven't gone their for anything but breakfast but you could order lunch items anytime. We'll have to try something from their lunch menu, but its tough because I love breakfast food!",

I had a good banter with her and she kept the conversation flowing. Also very quick to refill coffee and water.  -I went with the Fiesta Benedict on everything bagel as my meal. Not too bad. You at least get a good portion. Wasn't a huge fan of the fiesta Hollandaise sauce, but it's at least creative.   -There's also seats near the bathroom if there's a line, and an odd amount of religious crosses on wall.

    "text": "Went here for breakfast with my boyfriend. It was pretty good. He has the classic breakfast and I had the grilled chicken sandwich. The bread on the sandwich was my favorite part. It was nice and soft. The grilled chicken was kinda flavorless so I added buffalo sauce to it. I don't usually like macaroni salad but this one was quite alright, full of flavor and not so much mayo. Overall the food did taste pretty healthy and more on the fresher side. It costs us about $18 for two people so that's a great deal for bfast. Savannah was a great server!!! She was tentative and great with remember orders.",

We ordered the snow caps to start which were so yummy  my sister ordered the chicken salad sandwich and I ordered the spicy veggie wrap.... Both delicious!! For my daughter we did the Mickey Mouse pancakes... Needless to say she was in heaven!!   While we were waiting for our food Arianny got really fussy (I'm guessing because of her shots) and our waitress noticed and brought over two little toys and a necklace for her to play with... I thought that was very thoughtful!!   Definitely will be going back... I think I'm going to try the crunch berries French toast next time (;",

I love the staffs' \"Be Kind...\" shirts-a good reminder for the customers to behave. The food was on point; Hubbie ordered Corned Beef Hash with eggs over easy, cooked just right, everything bagel was toasted and delicious too. I ordered the Californian Omelette substituted the turkey with bacon sesame seed bagel came with it and potatoes well done as requested. Wonderful meal and good experience. We noticed it is pet-friendly for outdoor dining in front of their shop.  The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the coffee; it wasn't exceptional. It was more less typical coffee shop coffee which didn't quite hit the mark for me. Therefore one star deleted for mediocre coffee.",

The host at the front was friendly. After being sat though, the server was informal, decent, and eh. I understand that during a breakfast rush, servers want to get you in and out, but she was the definition of average. Was she rude? No. Friendly? No. She was ok.  We ordered those powdered bagel bites. My significant other got the eggs benedict. I got the omelet with bacon, avocado, and pepper jack. Banana and bagel on the side.  She said the eggs benedict was \"ok.\" The bagel bites were ok. As far as my food, was it bad? No. Was it out of this world? No. It was ok. A cut up banana on the side... fresh, but nothing done to it is... you guessed it... AVERAGE. Same with a toasted bagel and cream cheese on the side. BASIC.  As I ingested the average plate of food placed in front of me, I glanced at a message written on a small whiteboard across the room. It read...  \"My grace is sufficient for you... for my strength is made perfect in weakness\" 2 corinthians 12:9  Not arguing with you there Sunrise! If God wanted you to be average, he's more than happy with you.  Also, Sunrise, don't shoot me a message saying \"We're sorry for the bad experience... blah blah blah...\"   Did I have a bad experience? No. A great breakfast experience that exceeded expectations? No. I had a cookie cutter, run of the mill, ho hum breakfast. Average. Nothing special.   This place is not bad or good. It's just decent enough to keep its doors open and making money. And a decade from now, they'll still have their doors open to provide the Vegas eater with the same food, same service, and same AVERAGE experience.",

The place was jam packed but we were seated immediately.  The server came by and asked for our drink order.  Within minutes she was back and we ordered our meal.  In less than 10 monitors our meal was served!  WOW! That's fast!  I'd seen other Yelp pic's of their notorious breakfast potatoes so of course I had to order something that came with these little babies.  So glad I did because they lived up to their hype!  So so good!  I think I would come back and order a plate of potatoes and that's is, they are that good!  I did order the build your own omelet and it was just ok. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it either.  I liked that you could have avocado at no extra cost but I didn't like that they were not very generous with the serving.  Personal opinion maybe.  Cesar Q isn't a breakfast guy so he tried their lunch and said he liked it.  Location is great as it's just off the 215 at Eastern.  Parking wasn't an issue as this place sits in a strip mall like setting.  I would recommend this place if you are out and about and want to try some killer potatoes!!",

When you walk in you'll notice on the left there's different types of candy for sale like airheads or jaw breakers.   I ordered Turkey Citrus sandwich and it was awesome, had the right amount of spice to it and was packed with plenty of Turkey, no stinginess here. They offer a choice of potato salad, cole slaw, or mac salad with it. I got the mac salad and it was fine.   Service was good, waitress was prompt and fast, got our food within 10 minutes and she checked with us a few times. Only issue was they don't take AMEX, I want my double points! All good, I get it high transaction fees. Will return if we're ever in the area again.",

Every server that I have had when visiting has been courteous, knowledgeable, attentive and just plain nice and it's a pleasure to visit an establishment with that type of energy.

It's competitive price wise and the food quality for the price is a really good value. I've had a handful of items on the menu and haven't been disappointed by anything. While I love some of the fancier breakfast and brunch spots in town, sometimes just the simple breakfast comfort foods done right is exactly what you need.  This particular trip, my wife and I each got the breakfast plate with eggs, bacon, hash-browns and toast. Each with a drink and out total was $25. Eggs were cooked exactly how we asked, bacon was delicious, and their home style hash browns are yummy.  There is usually a wait, but they go so fast. They told us 25 minutes and we were seated in under 15 mins. I've waited longer to sit there, but usually the wait isn't too bad.  Overall, this place has better food than the cheap bar breakfasts you can find on every corner, but not as fancy as some of the elevated breakfast spots in Henderson. That niche is often neglected, but this place stays True to what breakfast should be and it keeps me coming back.",

I only ordered the French toast based on the description alone. I left the restaurant still hungry. Another party ordered it as part of a meal. Since I don't eat pork and the meal included bacon, I opted out of the full breakfast. Also, they should maybe consider flavored syrups. I would have preferred a choice. Also tried the little bagel bites. Don't remember what they were called. We all found them too hard and the accompanying sauces too sweet or just not to our liking. Overall, the French toast was good...just not that filling.",

I already want to stop in again to try more food.  I got the classic breakfast with bacon, toast, and scrambled eggs. Whoever cooked the bacon is my new best friend because it was crispy. Usually I have to ask for it to be cooked longer but not this time. For me it was perfect. My bestie got a make your own omelette and it was borderline huge with toast. She struggled to finish it. Both orders also came with a side of potatoes. They are a large shred of fresh potatoes that are a large shred, no small hash brown type shred.  Size wise the place leans toward the smaller side, but it's arraigned well and there is a small amount of outdoor seating (if sitting outside is your thing. In August, I wasn't interested.)",

    "text": "Let's face it - breakfast is a magical meal.  Whether you're eating it at 7 AM , 7PM , or 1 AM ... there's just something about the first (or last) meal of the day.    I'm relegated to eating oatmeal every weekday morning (don't ask ... ), but on the weekends I like to splurge a little.  And the Sunrise Cafe is one of my favorite places to welcome the day.  The vibe is hip, for a breakfast joint.  Lots of fit people migrate over from the nearby LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club for the recently transplanted).  Think beautiful people dressed to work out - though whether they really did work out is a mystery.   The menu is about what you'd expect from a breakfast eatery.  Eggs, french toast, pancakes, omelettes about any way you can imagine, bagels and lox, wraps, and some specialty dishes like the Peter Brady (you guessed it - pork chops and applesauce).  Prices are reasonable to high for breakfast.    I eat here about once a month or so.  Right off the 215 and Eastern, it's a convenient, fun, place to eat.  And with the number of people they serve in a given day, you know that the food is always fresh.  I have yet to show up when there wasn't a wait.  Not too long mind you - occasionally it can be 30 minutes, but usually the wait is only 5-10 minutes.  Most recently I had the Power Wrap; grilled chicken, egg whites, salsa, swiss cheese on a sun dried tomato tortilla with hash browns (crispy).  Very tasty, and pretty healthy, if you don't count the 1/2 pound of cheese and hash browns.  No matter, I'll work it off at the LVAC.   So to sum it up, if you're looking for a good place to eat, with a wide selection of \"healthy\" choices, friendly wait staff, and plenty of eye candy ... Sunrise Cafe is the place to go.",

That roll was soft and the taste combination delicious (next time I'll get Canadian bacon though as I tend to like it more. I was craving sausage that day and it was just what I was hoping for. Lots of sage and fennel).  Then I got something called \"Jacob's Slammin' Platter (I think that was the name). Wow. Lots of food, reasonably priced, smiling husband. Life doesn't get much better than that :).  So it's a place I will return to (and make it my destination not just a part of a list of chores).

He got a breakfast plate and I ordered a wrap, then the crunch berry FT togo. It felt a little crowded with some of the tables too close to one another but other than that it was very nice. I'll definitely be back.... Oh and I'm super picky with my French toast. It's amazing here!! I think it's the same one as blueberry hill so they get it from Great Buns. Love it!!",

The placed was not packed at all, the food was slow, the service was very fake, and the actual taste of the food itself was very lacking. When we walked in, the placed actually only had a handful of patrons, we then had to stand around and wait for a few minutes to be seated when there were clearly available waiters/waitresses. After being greeted by our waitress, it seemed she was not having a good day so we wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, but as time went on, she really was just plain unhappy to bring us our food and check on us. So after ordering our food and waiting 15-20 minutes for two of their basic sandwiches, we were excited to get something to eat. The sandwiches themselves were literally things we could have made at home in 10 minutes.  I had high hopes for this place considering I enjoy breakfast/lunch type places, but I was extremely disappointed. I might go back again if someone else pays for me though...",

More than half of their omelet choices are made with egg whites.   It has a homemade light, clean taste with no frills.  Their bread, biscuits and muffins are not homemade, which was a little bit of a disappointment.  The jam is just the little prepackaged stuff.    It's a nice neighborhood restaurant, but with nothing really drawing me here, I probably wouldn't make the drive to Henderson just to eat here.",

I was greeted by an extremely friendly staff and a crowd of smiling diners. The atmosphere and decor were very comfortable.  I got my coffee order in right away and began the task of selection. The Fiesta Benedict jumped out at me and I obliged. What a great choice. The server, Troy, I think, sorry, said that an everything bagel would be his choice for the meal. It was perfect. The benedict was delicious! A spicy hollandaise took me to heaven. The eggs were cooked perfect and the portion was just right. The potatoes soaked up a little of the yolk and sauce and amen, I was in church!  I was checked on frequently and my coffee was never below half. Great neighborhood spot, great spot to check out if on vacation.   As I exited, three staff told me, \"Thank you\" and \"Come again.\" You are very welcome and I will be back again soon.",

It was pretty packed, but we lucked out and got seated at the bar. Sometimes bars like that can be a squished situation, but there was plenty of room.   Sunrise Cafe's menu is large and everything sounded excellent. I was torn between one of the Benedict's and the Lox Platter. Since Jamie decided on the Fiesta Benedict I picked the Lox Platter.   Our server was very attentive and offered many refills to Jamie on her coffee. The food came out very quickly. Jamie and I shared our meal. My Lox Platter came with a sesame bagel. It had cream cheese, lots of Lox, tomatoes, onions, and capers. Plus, home style hash browns had onions mixed in, but they lacked seasoning. Jamie's Fiesta Benedict was covered in Hollandaise sauce and piled on an everything bagel. I loved that it had a tad of spice to it without burning your mouth. Plus, it had lots of crispy bacon. Yay!   I can't wait to bring my husband to this place. Next time I think I'll try the Prime Rib Benedict!",

Firstly... the food: The Bueno Beni was great. The eggs were perfectly done and the spiciness added with the salsa and fresh jalepenos was a great twist on your normal eggs beni. would certainly get this again. The wife got some sort of healthy omelette which seemed good, but she's a breakfast rookie and hence doesn't understand that the meal is all about maximizing grease, butter and hollandaise. But you can do that if it's your thing. Looked good.   Second... service: What you'd hope for for breakfast. Quick. Not in your face... more just to facilitate you getting in and out and keep your coffee and water full. We sat at the counter, which was a little cramped, but was the quickest way to get a seat.  Overheard a couple next to us which sent back a meal for a reason that was completely not the fault of the server/restaurant, and he dealt with it very professionally... it reminded me of why i'm not cut out for food service.  Third.... price: very reasonable. You're far away enough from the strip that you dont have to deal with the whole 3,000% markup thing.   Highly recommend. For the money, it's one of the best breakfast spots in town.",

It was very tasty and overly filling. I chose the bagel side, which came with about an entire container of cream  cheese. Overall the food was good and the service/atmosphere was less than enjoyable, averaging each other out. I probably won't be going again considering all of the other breakfast options in the area.",

    "text": "Excellent. Most impressed. First time here and I'm sure glad I picked this place for breakfast.   The place has a little of an East coast feel with the seating but then there's an outside sitting area which blends the West coast style.   But, the menu, the service, the food, and the prices were everyone's style.   Cool menu! I was having a hard time deciding what to get because literally every item sounded good. They have mostly breakfast but there's also lunch. We ordered breakfast.   Specifically came here for the eggs Benedict. I actually typed in eggs Benedict into my search engine and this was the first place to pop up. So, I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed.   I ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict and requested to get the eggs over medium instead of how the menu suggests, with scrambled. The fresh smell of cayenne and possibly paprika filled my nose with an excitement when the dish arrived. The sight of the fresh, hand-made, hash browns was sending my taste buds into overdrive and I'm quite sure I drooled a little before I could even pick up my silver ware. It was De Lish Us. So perfectly prepared, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly portioned.   She ordered the egg white omelette. It was vibrant in color from the fresh veggies that were still bursting with freshness. Cooked just right to keep their firmness but not so much to lose their color.   The server was very respectful and timely, always asking for a coffee refill just when I needed it, not just when she passed like often times other severs do. She checked before asking, very simple tactic which is a great indication that the server is paying attention but so many fail to do. Her friendliness, even in the middle of being loaded with several tables at once, was also impressive. This is what happens when I restaurant works good together. If the food is good then it makes the servers job more smooth and then the server is able to handle what they normally should be able to do, but if the food is bad then it makes the servers job much harder with complaining, unhappy guests. The server has plenty to do already but having to explain item problems shouldn't be one.   I will definitely recommend this great breakfast place to everyone I know.",

They were packed so the wait time was quoted at 30 minutes, but luckily we were seated within 20 minutes. ;)) The server was friendly and welcoming upon greeting the booth.   The food I tried was awesome!! The \"Sunrise Snowcaps\"  were addictive!! These are butter fried bagel slices with cinnamon sugar.. ahh it's like a churro or funnel cake.. party in your mouth, it  sure did give me a sweet tooth. I also ordered the \"Cajun Prime Rib Beni\" (Scrambled eggs topped with thinly sliced cajun seasoned prime rib, sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions, topped with melted cheddar cheese and hollandaise, served open face on grilled garlic toast), which was unique and flavorful especially with the meat and garlic toast! The service lacked a bit on a *cinnamon bagel with cream cheese* never being delivered as ordered with \"The Classic Breakfast Order\" and we had to tell the server so minus a star for that. Other than that this is a yummy local place to enjoy the most important meal of the day!",

We were greeted and seated immediately by the friendly hostess.   Our waiter kept the good service going.  He was attentive and polite.  The dining area is quaint with what it seems like plenty of tables but I can see it filling quickly.  There are also some patio seating options but might only be tolerable when the temps are less than 100 degrees.    I opted for the Brooklyn Benedict.  This was so delicious and not your traditional benedict. It contained turkey, spinach, melted swiss, eggs and hollandaise on a bagel.  The turkey had a wonderful flavor complimented with the desired hollandaise sauce.  The hash browns were also wonderfully done.  Browned with enough crisp just like they were tanning by the pool all day.    It was a great breakfast with great service.  I'm ready to come back for another round!",

That wasn't listed on the menu and it was not good. Thank God the menu did list that it came with scrambled eggs so I could specifically ask them to change it to a poached one.",

I had their \"Chester's Way\" ( their \"famous\" Corned Beef and Eggs) which was basically canned CB hash but, the way they cooked it was tasty.  Hubs had the Eggs Benedict, and we shared the Bread Pudding Pancakes, which we both thought would have the consistency of bread pudding, but was just pancakes sprinkled with sugary cinnamon and a caramel sauce, which did make it taste like bread pudding, I suppose.  Coffee was robust.  Service was fast and friendly.  I'd definitely recommend checking out OSC for breakfast, just be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends.  #BreakfastAtOSC",

Beef was cooked with mushrooms they were not too dry, and sitting on bread (grilled with butter, the best part).  The fiesta benny was second best. They were ok. Came with bagels so it was a little heavier.  I couldn't resist ordering the sunrise snow caps, which were decadent. It was a big order so definitely too much for one person. Best shared among 3 people, unless you love carbs and sugar. Kids would love them!  Coffee was a 2/5. Very light here. And the server initially filled regular coffee, then refilled with flavored hazelnut coffee (like the ones you get at panera?).   The service was a 5/5. Sat at the bar.

You don't have to be on a diet, they just have a lot of health stuff.  Go for any of the breakfasts and not the other stuff.  Service - The service is freakin awesome. I really like them all and they are all consistently top notch.  Price - Very reasonable. Never, ever will I eat at IHOP, or Denny's again. This place is just the right place at the right price.  Location - A bit busy at the 215 and Eastern near the LVAC.  Feeling - Very nice place to eat, very comfortable, outdoor dining. Have dogs?  Bring them!

    "text": "Came here after the 5k Santa Run with my fellow runners today and got sat immediately even though It was pretty pack.  It's a cutesy spot that serves breakfast, wraps, sammiches, smoothie bar, and stuff.    We all ordered their iced tea since my friends insist they have really good Tropical Iced Tea, and sure enough they were right.  I'm not a big fan of iced tea, so its remarkable that i was able to take another sip or in this case a refill.  For my meal I built an egg white omelet (99cent to sub egg white) with turkey, ham, and cheddar. It cames with hash brown and with choice of bread, but i skipped the bread because i knew i was going to order the Blueberry Pancake once it popped up as i skimmed through the menu. Sadly, the Blueberry Pancake was huge disappointment since my recent discovery <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-m-donuts-anaheim#hrid:cm5Iy1u9yABwimWy3pM5SQ\">yelp.com/biz/m-and-m-don...</a>. I was expecting that the berries would at least be infused in the with the pancake batter but they were just a regular pancakes made with blueberries toss in it.  Weak!  Oh, and my turkey in my omelet were big cube chunks of turkey similar to deli meat.    Their stripped hash browns however were amazing. I'm a sucker for any stripped hash and OSC does their well. Each strips were cooked just right with a subtle yet hint of a distinctive flavor. I mean i could be the only one but the nip was so minute that i think they cook it in a meat flavor oil or something.  It was delish!  Overall I left the place and felt pretty good and not have over the top disgusting brekkie feeling. 3.5  *TIP*  Dog friendly outdoor sitting area with dog treats available.",

To me that indicated the food must be good!  I was not let down the food was fantastic.  I ordered the breakfast burrito; it contained pancake, eggs and sausage.

One had the jalapenos which was slightly spicier (forgot which one that was) so if you like a good kick order that one! Service was perfect.

I was pretty excited because I was pretty hungry. The wrap was very full of steak, which is usually a good thing. It was okay, but it lacked flavor. I ended up only eating half of it and left the rest for later. I was a little disappointed. The hash browns were a little soggy.   I may have just picked the wrong thing on the menu. I would definitely give this place another try and maybe pick something a little more popular on the menu.",

There's lots of ample seating, and the service was fast and friendly. There's an older crowd that comes in (kinda like early-morning grandparents that like to go out for breakfast and coffee), but that doesn't really take away from the experience.  I got to taste the Brooklyn Benedict. It looks just as good as it does in the first picture. It comes in two giant pieces dripping in hollondaise sauce. It's got some turkey bits inside, which was different, but it went well with it. The whole piece was topped on top of an everything bagel, which I guess is where the Brooklyn name comes from, and it tastes very good with it! I didn't expect that at all. Only thing is that the bagel (like any other bagel) is very hearty, moreso than the normal bread you would get. So it's extremely filling. But it tasted great in combination.  Also got to try the Crunchberry Toast. It's french toast with what seems to be small bits of colorful cereal meshed into egg/batter that surrounds the bread. It's very good, but very sweet. So I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a sweet tooth (as if the maple syrup wasn't sweet enough), but I was able to manage through a few bites. I probably wouldn't be able to finish a whole plate by myself though, because I'm not a big sweets guy myself. But otherwise it was still really good.  If you're looking for coffee. It's horrible. Don't even bother. Get juice or something. Coffee we had was extremely watery. I tried to mask it with cream and sugar (I usually drink my coffee black), but I still couldn't handle it and didn't take more than 4 sips from my mug.",

First of all THEY WERE LEADWEIGHTS!!  It was like eating a layer cake! In addition, it was not tasty AT ALL! What ever its batter was? LOUSY!!     Needless to say, I WILL NEVER order this again and as a matter of fact I may not visit here again. If you are a fan of 'lead weight pancakes'  that comes from a batter that is not tasty? order these, you'll love them AND AS A SIDE note I did not find some of the employees here friendly!",

Bagel was a little soggy. Fietsa sauce tasted like creamy salsa, I wasn't a big fan of it.  I should have stuck to the classic benedict. Service was decent.",

    "text": "I'm way late with this review. We dined on a Sunday over the summer. It was pretty toasty outside and their A/C went out. We figured we'd be in & out so we didn't mind waiting and decided to stay. They kindly handed out water for those that were waiting.  Finally, we were seated. Our order was quickly taken, but the wait for our food was lengthy. It gave us time to notice the booth beside us had some misbehaved children that were bouncing all over. The boy bounced about so much that he heaved up breakfast. They left the mess and what appeared to be a very small tip. The table sat empty waiting to be cleaned, they got a bus boy over with a stomach that could handle it. He cleaned the table like it was any other mess. And the next couple was immediately seated. I really expected the area to be disinfected with care. I cringed when the unknowing couple sat down. I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time, but it's the first I've witnessed it. So that was a turn off.  We were starved and sweaty by the time our breakfast arrived. The garden of eden for me and a build your own for him. We prefer omelets with the cheese on the inside, a personal preference, I know so I try not to let it sway my judgement. However, these were underseasoned. Just very bland. They might be eggwhites, but that doesn't mean that shouldn't be flavorful. Breakfast came to $30 plus tip. We failed to find the value.",

I landed on the Hipster Wrap with a side salad. Although not an allergy I don't like tomatoes. I asked for no tomatoes and I seemingly got extra? (See photo). They also forgot my dressing for the side salad and I had to ask for it after I ate half of my wrap. The service was okay. The food was actually good for what it was. I would give this place another chance, beware if you have actual allergies, as they may not take note.",

I love the inside and the wall of soda pop, very original stuff I don't see often.  One of my favorite things there is the Brooklyn Benedict, Its soooo good! Also I like the breakfast Krispy cream wrap. Very delicious, it has grilled onions and cream cheese in it. The Fiesta Benedict is REALLY good! Jalapeno bacon is the bomb!  One time I got crunch berry toast, wasn't too impressed. Also I feel that the regular french toast and sides of pancakes are a little on the higher price sides. Wish they had a smaller order.   They have a great cheese burger salad. I know that sounds nuts but you MUST try it!   The servers here are REALLY great people. You can tell they enjoy their jobs, even when it gets busy there, and it gets VERY busy!   Where there is good food, there are tons of people!",

Jordan had their Fiesta Beni, a little spicer than most but perfect for him. He also tried their coffee of the day which was a warm butterscotch flavor. I opted for the normal black coffee as well as their oatmeal overload. Unfortunately, as I am gluten free, I was unable to try their pancakes or French toast. However, the oatmeal came with blueberries, bananas, raisins, brown sugar, and granola. I also tried a side of their homemade potatoes since they are never fried and always fresh!  Needless to say we had a fabulous experience, I highly recommend this cafe to anyone!",

It's a fairly big restaurant for a breakfast joint, with patio seating (for those rare but treasured COOL days in vegas).  I ordered the traditional french toast ($7.69) and made it a platter (+$3.50) by adding two eggs over-medium and bacon.  It was all delicious and cooked really well. The bacon was amazing.    My boyfriend ordered the ranchero wrap with the chipotle tortilla and hashbrowns.  He liked the wrap, but the hashbrowns definitely stole the show here.   His mom had the short stack pancake platter ($7.69 + $3.50) and grandma had the Garden of Eden omelette ($9.25).  They both loved the meals.  The service was a little slow.  It felt like forever before our waiter finally came to take our order.  At least he was friendly.  The man who actually brought out our food was great, making sure we had everything we needed.  The prices here are very reasonable.  The $3.50 it cost me to make my french toast a platter included two eggs and four pieces of bacon, which is more than what you usually get at other breakfast spots.",

My husband loves the cordbeef hash he said it's the best in vegas, I always get the jacob's slammin platter, the price is cheap compared to all the food you get. The potatoes are nothing you have ever had anywhere! I always get a bagel for my bread choice with spread. I am yet to finish all my food because you get some much! This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot! I bought a discount card from my kids school so last year they had discount buy one get one 50% off, Iove a place that helps out it's schools and provides great food and svc. Its also dog friendly if yo want to eat outside with your pet not sure if they are allowed indoors",

I was running late and was starved, so I called my friends to tell them to order for me.  I arrived, and the place was PACKED... At 10:30 on a weekday!  The restaurant is a decent size too, with outdoor seating as well.  My friends decided to wait for me to order, and my heart sunk.  I was so hungry, and by the looks of the packed crowd, I wasn't going to be eating anytime soon.  I was wrong!  Our waiter was so attentive, came over as soon as I arrived, and we were eating about 12-15 minutes later.  I ordered an omelette on the recommendation of my friend who had been there before, but was very weary, as I usually hate egg white omelettes due to lack of flavor.  Again, I was wrong!  My omelette was amazing, and the hash browns are to DIE for.  So delicious... I can't wait to go back!    The only negative is the parking.  This is located in a very busy shopping center, and finding a parking spot can be tough.",

BTW: If you plan on ordering your own dish and think you'll only have a couple bites of a shared order of pancakes - ain't gonna happen. I say that to myself every time, and I end up stuffed! It's just so good!  It's always busy, so you'll have to wait, but it's worth it. Fresh, quality ingredients, delicious food, servers are always very helpful, and it's super kid-friendly. On another note: ladies, the bathroom is clean and the lotion they have in there smells so good! ;-)",

The waiters are friendly and all of the staff is very helpful.  I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant, and given the option to sit in or outside.  Outside seating is nice and cozy for a nice spring day brunch!  They give you the option of bagel or toast and a side of sliced bananas.  Their orange juice is also really yummy and fresh.  They also have turkey sausage which is great for people like myself, who don't eat pork or beef.  The turkey sausage was delicious! Overall, it's a great little brunch spot :)",

As much a \"mom n' pop\" spot as any in Las Vegas it was 7:05am when I walked in the cafe door and with smiley greetings amidst the sunbathed room I quickly found a seat, a full view of the kitchen plus the NFL Draft my amusement as I navigated the two-page laminated menu with the first of several cups of coffee in hand.  Always trending sweet over savory it was with gluttony followed by glee that I inquired about half-portions or short-stacks and informed that both could be accommodated it was a quartet that comprised my order, the signature \"Snow Caps\" of sliced bagels fried in butter under a dusting of cinnamon sugar soon delighting me in its simplicity as I watched the restaurant fill.  Ever gracious in service as java flowed free a pair of pancakes arrived next and although improved by creamy dulce de leche the cakes themselves lacked, a mistake thankfully not replicated in either of the French Toasts, The Ultimate a more traditional version with buttery bread soaked in toffee and caramel while the Homerun can best be described as a battered after-school snack griddled to soft and topped with fresh bananas plus grape jam - a concept as simple as the Snow Caps and every bit as worth getting out of bed early for.",

    "text": "Original Sunrise Cafe is one of the best breakfast and brunch places I've been too. Very consistency offering great service, food, and prices.   lt's always busy but the service is really good still. The 'family' of servers work together to help each other with refills and most have been there for years. The owners work very often, almost everyday, and are Super nice! They deserve the success this place has. The owner Andrew has explained in detail how some of the menu items have special dressing or toppings to blend everything on your plate perfectly. He explained how the make the dressing in house after I told him how perfect a dressing was. He was thrilled to hear my compliment since he made the dressing recipe himself.   I love the Peter Bradley Pork Chop Meal: It comes with an amazing piece of center cut pork loin that's apple wood smoked and topped with citrus chili sauce (epic).  Great salads: Make your own. Or just try one of their perfectly blended ones like I explained earlier. I love the Jacobs Slammin Platter breakfastcombo plate: There are no \"or's\" you get a great mix of bacon, ham, and sausage and also includes potatoes and 3 silver dollar pancakes. Epic meal for $10! The Benedict's are all epic: They use basted eggs that have more golden thicker yolk than poached eggs.   After coming dozens of times and can say without a doubt this is one of my favorite places to eat and I'll be back many times. One lady literally comes everyday and orders her salad that's on there hidden menu. Another customer orders a wrap that's not on the menu anymore. They cater to there regulars and for that I'm very thankful.   Come check out the Original Sunrise Cafe to judge yourself, I bet you'll like them.   Thanks for reading, take care!",

While it's way off the strip, if you're visiting Vegas, this is a solid breakfast place to swing by en route to airport (which is less than 10 mins away).  Food: ordered the bread pudding pancakes and \"to Brie or not to Brie\".  Many other items looked so tasty on the menu and it was hard to decide.  We saw some large hearty omelettes served at table next to us.  Bread pudding pancake did not meet the hype, I love bread pudding and this was just pancakes and raisins, but they were redeemed with the amazing Brie, raspberry and orange marmalade dish served warm out of the oven on a split bagel.  Will definitely try to recreate this at home.  Husband ordered Reuben and he scarfed it down, so must've been tasty.",

I was not fortunate however the food was good.  It was exactly how I ordered it, came out in a decent amount of time, and the staff were friendly and welcoming.  I got the potato salad which tastes PHENOMENAL by the way.  I enjoyed the sandwich, but as I said before it wasn't comparable to what I was attempting to imitate.  The sandwich itself is verrrry greasy, and comes in a thin white wrapper.  It almost seems like parchment paper but not as thick and protective because grease is literally all over my work pants since I set the sandwich on my lap :( mistake on my part.  It was on my lap no more than 3 minutes but the grease soaked right into them.  I'll definitely be returning, but will be trying other things on the menu instead of trying to replace the irreplaceable on the opposing coast.",

Downside is we were seated outside and it was a little bit nippy, but fortunately we are seated right in the Sun.  The staff here were very attentive and very quick to check up on us and get our orders as well as making sure to keep our drinks full.  We decided to start out with their muffin of the day, which was the blueberry muffin. It was a gigantic one that they apparently cut in half and then Grill. It is also made in-house, which definitely shows as both the texture and taste of the muffin were fantastic.  Personally I went with the make your own omelette, I put in Swiss cheese, steak, spinach, Sunrise grilled onions, and avocado. My sides were hash browns and sourdough toast.  The hash browns were practically perfect. They weren't overly cooked and weren't saturated eith oil. You could easily taste the potatoe in them.  The sourdough toast was just like all sourdough.   The omelette came out fantastic. The avocado was fresh, the steak was cooked and seasoned well. The sunrise grilled onions were sauteed onions made in house, and I do recommend getting them!  The restrooms were clean, however there were only 2 which caused quite a wait.  Overall score 4.5 out of 5.",

Our waiter (owner?) Was super nice and personable. Even gave is two to go cups of coffee for our drive home. If we come back into town, we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "OSG is now one of my favorite breakfast places in Las Vegas.   This place is constantly packed and yet well worth it, with a giant selection of root beers and a delicious grilled blueberry English muffin, we immediately knew this place was going to be awesome.   Sadly, my boyfriend and I ordered the same thing which was the fiesta Benedict, and might I just say that jalapeno bacon needs and award. It is super delicious with a last minute kick!   I recommend ordering a side of it because it's really that good. I loved the hollandaise sauce as it had the tanginess from the lemon, but also a kick in it. You have the choice of placing it on a bagel or a Kaiser roll. I never knew bagels and Benedict's were such a great pairing. It came with a side of hashbrowns which were just the right amount of crisp!  That captain crunch French toast is so delicious. Take a bite of nostalgia and enjoy a plate of that. My main regret was only getting a side order instead of a half order.   Say good morning to your newest hangout and give Sunrise a try!   Happy Eating!",

It is quite busy all the time, so be prepared to wait at least 5 minutes for a table and up to 15 during peak times (most of the time during weekends). However, once you're seated you won't regret it as the servers are always attentive, your drinks will always be full and the fresh squeezed orange juice is one of the most delicious things on the menu! In addition, the omelettes (my favorite) are always made with the freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection.   All in all, In the many years we've been coming here everything has always been good and consistent, which is why we continue to choose Sunrise regardless of what trendy spot opens. If you want healthy options, friendly smiles and a homey atmosphere regardless of how crowded it is, this is the place to be.",

I called ahead and got on the list and was told it should just be a few mins wait when we arrived. Parking was very limited, and we still had to wait 15 mins, mostly outside, until we got a table. We ordered our drinks and food at once in hopes that we would get our food more quickly. Unfortunately we didn't and it took at least 15 closer to 20 minutes more to get our food. We finally got our food, but had no silverware to eat it with. My husband immediately went and asked our server for silver and it was still another 5 mins for that. The food was bland and the portions were small, service was spotty and the table next to us was sending stuff back so it wasn't just us. Egg works just blows them out of the water, sorry. I would rather wait 15 mins longer to sit and get my better food faster. We won't be going back.",

On my first visit, I ordered the avocado toast and the server suggested that I can make it an entire meal with crispy bacon and hash browns. The avocado toast was delicious. The avocado spread really wasn't on toast but on a soft roll. The spread was accompanied with tomato and micro greens. Yum yum yum. The bacon was perfectly crisp and plentiful. I left there pretty full to say the least. Also, coffee is bottomless and they even offer a cup to go when you leave. Food, service and ambiance for breakfast, all on point!

The coffee was awesome, just the right amount of strength - wasn't watered down nor super strong and bitter.  The service was excellent. We sat at the counter so as to get in and out. The reason for the four stars is because there was one server who seemed rude, and didn't speak nor acknowledge us being there.

They offered to split the two meats when we ordered it last time.  She says the Turkey & Eggs?  I say no the classic just split the meat so she charges us still for the Turkey & Eggs?   I don't think I've ever been here on a Thursday so maybe that's why service sucks.  The Caramel coffee was the ONLY awesome thing this time.   After our meal was served, Jeff C.'s toast looked like someone took a bite of it & was super soggy.  Mine looked good & from a totally different bag.  We sat w/ no place set-up, silverware or hot sauce... the server who brings our breakfast brings it...two full bottles of Franks Red Hot like somehow I was going to finish a whole bottle.  He asks anything else?  Yes silverware.  When we did get it Jeff's was sticky like jelly. Usually they fill up the coffee. Mine sat empty for awhile.   Itll be awhile until I come back.  Disappointed.  We originally went to Cracker Barrel, but still the wait is an hour on a Tuesday so we headed not far to the OSC.  Immediately, we were greeted & seated.  Love the original staff some of which are still here too. Forewarning, expect a wait on the weekends, usually no more than 15 minutes & packed, but worth it!  They not only have awesome breakfast, lunch and a bar counter to sit at, if you're in a rush or alone, but they sell local art pieces displayed on the wall, old fashioned candy & sodas so it gives you that down home comfy feeling.  Also I am a coffee freak so always look forward to their specialty coffees such as the Cinnamon-Hazelnut coffee.  Mmm!     Daisy was our awesome server today.  Thank you for making our morning so wonderful.    New to OSC Bacon Ribs glazed in bourbon BBQ sauce!",

It always seems a little odd to go to a strip center for a good meal, but this place is awesome! We had the To Brie or Not to Brie, Jacob's Slammin Platter, Sin O Man Pancakes and the Brooklyn Benedict. The place is clean and cute, the food came out piping hot and was so good. The waitress was attentive while eating and speedy with the check. I think we might go back tomorrow morning before we head home!",

My favorite healthy item is the power wrap with chicken, egg whites, and salsa in a wheat tortilla.  If you are looking for more traditional fare you can't go wrong with chesters way (their version of corned beef hash) or even just the classic with bacon (always crispy) and the buttery potatoes.  If you want a bit of everything go for Jacob's slammin platter.  As if the food wasn't enough to keep me coming back the service is top notch.  Very attentive and friendly.  Go there a few times and they start remembering your drink order.  Don't be alarmed if the place is busy.  It may seem like it will take forever but they turn tables there very quickly and they'll bring around samples to taste too.",

All in all I think I've been here about 6 or 7 times in the last 4 years and they hit a home run every single time I've dined. Always had breakfast items and never lunch so my experiences are a bit one-sided.  It's always very busy on weekends during the breakfast-brunch hours and usually there is a wait to get a table. It was me and a couple buddies and ones fiance after a night of drinking a few brews. Comfort food was in need. We walked up at about 10:30 saturday and they said it would be 10-15 mins for a table, but we could sit at the bartop right away if we wanted it. We chose the bartop and immediately got waters, menus, and silverware. The waters are big which is very nice after a night of drinking and becoming dehydrated.  We all quickly scanned the menus and ordered. I got the Jacob's Slammin Platter and it was large and fantastic and was about all I could put down. The eggs (scrambled) were perfect, the country potatoes were awesome and crispy.  The 1 sausage patty, 2 strips of bacon, 1 Canadian bacon slice, and the 4 mini pancakes were all perfectly cooked for me as well. It also came with 4 half slices of toast, two were a little bitty bit burned for me, but I was full anyway so I just nibbled on the toast at the end of the meal.   Everybody in my party was extremely pleased with the food, service and speed, price, and location. We all crashed at my buddies house which is near GVR so it was just 3 or so miles down the road. We all went back to the house happy and fat, and didn't take a hug chunk out of our wallets. You can see on the yelp business page for OSC snap-shots of the menu, prices are all in the $6-10 dollar range for most meals, and there's plenty of food in each of the ones I've had.",

    "text": "Back for another splendid Sunday brunch review is Mike P and Ashley D!!!! We embarked for an adventure at the Original Sunrise Cafe as we were both starving and unable to use our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate at Hash house on Sundays :(.... boo.  Anyway to the review:  The Original Sunrise Cafe was packed! However, with good luck on our side we were seated in about five minutes.  The cafe had a nice vibe and was filled with people.  Fresh coffee was....well....Vegas cafe coffee; nuff said.  After a few glances around the menu we both noted how they covered several breakfast categories but only offered a small selection for each.   We both decided on omelets and OSC offers egg white versions of every omelet.  I have to say that my omelet the Eggzilla (Egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers and salsa topped with sunrise garlic sauce and jack cheese) was pretty good.  Although, Ashley D's omelet was nothing to write home about; sadly.  Overall, for $8.99 they come with a bagel/toast on the side making it a decent deal.  I just think for the amount of breakfast/brunch locations you can do a little better.",

    "text": "Some places simply get the job done, and there's not much more to say. Yes, the Sunrise may be a candidate for a one-sentence review, but I will elaborate a little. I have dined here twice. The first time was under serious time constraints, and all I had was a turkey wrap. All I can say is that it was indeed a turkey wrap.  The second time I had a bit more time to peruse the menu and make an informed decision. What surprises me is that it is the type of place where you expect to order whole grain pancakes, but there is a small problem, they don't have whole-wheat pancakes. This is not a darling, hippie, organic, super creative, knockin' my socks off cafe where you can get a mixed green salad with your sundried tomato pesto egg white omelet and glass of carrot ginger juice. They serve breakfast, sandwiches, wraps and salads, and it is all simply getting the job done for me.  On the repeat visit, I went with the Veggie Benedict with the Hollandaise on the side on top of an everything bagel with a side of potatoes. The veggies included sliced tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. The Benedict sans sauce definitely tasted good for you. The bagel could have used a little more everything, but it was soft and easy to eat. The potatoes were tasty--definitely not the best for you, as I am pretty sure the tastiness was a result of butter. I would eat it again if I were in the area and needed a breakfasty bite, but I would not drive there just to eat it.   There was no wait on a Sunday morning at 11am. The service was great. And, note to dog peeps: They have a dog friendly patio.",

    "text": "I'm a local, and I've had way better breakfasts at other restaurants. We arrived, and were told that there was a 25 minute wait for a table for 4. That's no biggie, as we've waited longer for tables before. The issue we had was when \"friends\" entered the establishment. Those people waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. We kept getting bumped. That did not bode well, and we sure hoped the food was worth the wait. Meh...it really wasn't. We ended up waiting close to 40 minutes for a table, and after being seated, there was confusion about exactly where we were to sit. So, we shuffled between two tables until someone made a decision and put us at a table. Brendan (Brandon?) our server was the highlight. He was very kind. We ordered the ultimate french toast, which was okay, but we've had better. The pb/jam french toast is pretty unique, and my child loved it. I had an omelet, which came with hash browns, and it was okay. I've had just as good elsewhere. We also ordered corned beef hash, and it tasted salty, according to my spouse, and I thought it tasted like the canned stuff we prepare at home.   Overall, we expected a wait, as it was the weekend. However, the constant bumping of us down the seating priority (we counted probably 4-5 times we were bumped) was really the deal breaker.   If you want a super good breakfast, go to the Beach Cafe, which is off Jones, in Las Vegas. Egg Works are good. Rise and Shine is good. Bite in Summerlin is good. Lots of places are good in Las Vegas and Henderson. We won't be back here because we apparently don't know anybody there to get seated in a timely fashion. This was a one and done for us.",

    "text": "yelp app, have i told you lately how much i loved you? ... made a random trip out to vegas and stayed off the strip at the green valley ranch and trusted the yelp app to help me find delicious things to put into my mouth.   what i ate: - cajun prime rib beni: garlic toast topped with thinly sliced prime rib, topped with savory sauteed mushrooms, thin tender scrambled egg, and smothered with an amazing hollandaise sauce. uh, why can i have this every morning? this was so amazing. the only problem i had with it was that i couldnt really taste the \"cajun\" part of the cajun prime rib. but seriously, who the heck cares, this was so tasty! came with a side of hash browns that was very tasty, but the beni took center stage  pros: - food: the beni was amazing. the potatoes were also amazing. the coffee was delicious - huge portions! i could barely finish the beni and i barely had much of my potatoes.  - service: just right for this type of brunch place. our coffee cups were always full - no wait! though, we came in during the week. they were bustling and busy, but there were empty tables. and the turnaround was fairly quick.   - clean bathroom - a few tables were on the patio area for people and their dogs. though, i guess it's a very locals thing; i could barely stand being outside in the heat, even if it was in the shade  cons: - location: definitely a locals spot. this was a bit far from the strip, so i doubt id be back for breakfast.   would i come again? due to the location, probably not.",

The initial wait for our table was made more pleasant and comfortable when the hostess offered us (and everyone else waiting) blueberry muffin and water.  Waiting sucks, but they made it more pleasant with their nice gesture.   Concerning the food, I had the Bueno Beni; it was delicious.  Based on the reviews, it doesn't appear like you can go wrong with any dish.   Finally, the servers were great and the general ambiance was very pleasant. I would highly recommend this place and there is no doubt that I'll be back.",

After waiting some time to have our order taken, we then proceeded to wait 45 minutes for food that never showed up.   The server could not be bothered, we had to track him down for some service. Once we spoke with him about not having received our food, we never saw him again. To make matters worse when we got up to pay for the empty soda on the table we had to wait for service again.  The food may be great but the moral is service wins the day or loses it as the case may be. I guess it's time to find a new place for breakfast.",

But this is the place you want to go to if you want to splurge a little on a breakfast to have quality breakfast or even a lunch.   I always get there omelettes or the Ultimate French toast. And guess what they have never disappointed me. Your morning need of protein and carbs are delivered here for $10-13 a plate. And speaking of delivery, they are very quick. Usually, once you order your food it comes out in 15 minutes. I recommend doing a pick up if you in a rush.   They are well staffed and all of them are very friendly. And if you go there enough then they will know your usual order and would be treated like a family.   Also, this is a popular place so you might run into local resident celebrities. I got to sit next to Spencer Haywood and saw Mike Tyson.   P.S.  I still have not tried their Jalapeno Bacon, but I hear that its amazing. Go and see for yourself.",

My friend that I was with is a vegetarian and they were very accommodating to that. I ordered the Bueno benny. I was a little skeptical because I love a good eggs benny and everytime I try to have a different variation from the traditional I always end up disappointed. The server recommended that I have it on a pretzel bagel which sounds a little strange but it was delicious! I docked one star because I noticed a sign on my table saying there was going to be an additional $1.25 surcharge to any menu item that had egg whites due to a \"national egg shortage\" and this surcharge would apply to all menu items that have egg whites only. The server confirmed that the $1.25 would indeed go on top of the menu items that have egg whites in them. I've seen a surcharge before for substituting egg whites but I've never heard of a national egg shortage nor a surcharge applied that way. Weird.   Overall great experience and I will definitely be back.",

I love their friendly service, menu options and absolutely love the fact that I can pay $1.50 to substitute 2 pieces (1 slice of Texas toast cut into two pieces) of French toast for my toast/bagel. I normally go to Egg Works (which I also enjoy and dine often) but Sunrise Cafe definitely beats Egg Works when it comes to potatoes!! Sunrise has crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside hash browns that are made with love and cooked to perfection. Brandon is an awesome waiter and he is incredibly helpful when it comes to menu suggestions. I've tried the breakfast plate with the silver dollar pancakes and the big Greek omelette and I've enjoyed them both. My mom ordered the Garden of Eden omelette and by the looks of her completely empty plate, I know she enjoyed it. Also, the person who cooked my bacon deserves a hug. It was crispy just how I like it, the Canadian bacon was delicious and I really enjoyed their sausage patties. I usually don't order meals with a ton of meat included in them but Sam's breakfast platter (I think that's the name) had great portion sizes that weren't overwhelming. I'm definitely looking forward to going back, I live in Summerlin and they're totally worth the drive!!",

    "text": "First time at Original Sunrise Cafe last week. I went with my husband and our friend who was in from out of town.   We were greeted and sat right away. Our server offered us drinks and gave us time to go over the menu. He was very nice and attentive throughout our dining experience.   Since we were here for breakfast, I didn't spend too much time looking at the menu other than for breakfast foods. I did take a sneak peek at their sandwiches though, and they sound good. I would go back to try lunch.   I'm a huge fan of pancakes, so I decided to get blueberry pancakes. They were good, but all the blueberriers were right in the center of the pancakes [in the batter, of course]. Not what I expected nor cared for. I'd prefer to have them spread out evenly. However, they were still appetizing.  Good food at a decent price so I would go back.",

My fiance says that our server, Matthew, was awesome and gave great recommendations. Coffee was also very good. There are a few tables to dine outside as well. We will be coming back soon to try the English toffee and pecan french toast. Today we both had breakfast Benedicts. Mine was the Fiesta, which had eggs, bacon, diced jalapenos, and a spicy hollandaise sauce. Very good! My fiance had the traditional eggs Benedict and was over the moon with the hollandaise sauce. Also loved the inspirational messages near the front door. This cafe was a wonderful find!",

First off, we were seated and brought drinks really quickly. But upon seeing the menu, my boyfriend and I were very unimpressed. We usually like to order country fried steak or skillets, but they had neither. We ended up picking the two best sounding items on the menu and after a suggestion from the waitress, ultimately ended up ordering the Cajun prime rib Benedict and the crunch berry French toast. And we were so ready to be disappointed but man... It was SOO  delicious. The texture and flavor of the French toast was perfection, not too sweet and not soggy. It had a really good crisp on the outside and was warm and fuzzy and the inside. And the bendedict... I must say that it was topped with the best hollandaise sauce I've ever tasted.. Overall a wonderful experience. Device was stellar as well, very friendly and attentive. I would definitely stop here again next time I'm on this side of town!",

HEAVEN!  Sadly, we found a strand of hair on our 2nd to last piece of toast just right as the server walked up to check on us -- and she apologized profusely as we pulled the hair out.  She turned a couple shades of red and asked if we would like a new plate... we were like, \"REALLY?!  We were just going to finish the plate off (minus the hair\" 'cause it's THAT GOOD!!\"  HA HA!  We ordered the Peter Brady \"Porkchops and applesauce\" -- the porkchop is on the 'dry' side -- nothing special.  The mound of homemade potatoes had a nice chili kick to it.

    "text": "Yet another strip mall restaurant that completely does not know how to arrange their shop, but that is neither here or there if the food is good. Before I entered I had heard good things about this place so was a bit put off but not unreasonably so. We were greeted and seated within a reasonable amount of time (it was like 11:00 am so I would hope so) and handed menus and placed a drink order that was filled immediately. So far so good.  Like my quest for good Q, I have a thing for great pastrami. There are a few places in LV that do pastrami ok, but here was a cafe with one of the most unlikely sandwiches I could think of on the menu. They call it \"The 215\", (probably because the 215 freeway is a couple hundred yards away) and it is a pastrami, turkey, and slaw stack sandwich. Any of you Deli Heads recognize this recipe? It is the #11 at most deli's or what is known as \"The Sky High\". This is a good sandwich and from a pretty discriminating deli fan that is saying a lot. OK, it's not Canters Deli in LA, but it kinda reminds me of it. The only strange thing is they put it on a soft roll, not a Kaiser Roll, but then again, I have a feeling these people do not have a clue what real deli food is, they just got lucky. Look, they had crosses for sale and I am betting the place is owned by good Christians. Hey, no problem, just I am not seeing a lot of deli understanding, just good copying.  My wife ordered a Feta Burger. Feta, spinach, a sauce and a burger on the same soft bun and my wife enjoyed it. Side were acceptable. Beverages (Iced Tea and Iced Coffee) were fresh and tasty. Service was attentive to the point of maybe being too attentive. (There is something to be said for not being asked if everything is ok every 4 minutes.)  I would come back here again, but honestly I do not see what the rave is all about. If doing a respectable job and having respectable food is now a 4 and 5 star dining experience I think people need to learn to be a little tougher in their reviews. This is a solid 3 star place and places it on the \"diners I would visit again\" list. Heck i would even take friends there. 5 stars, no. 4 stars, not likely, but a solid 3 stars with confidence.  ---  My wife and I had an interesting conversation about why things are served in a deli. Whether the owners of deli's know it or not there is a reason for what is on the table and what is served as sides. It all has to do with how they make the meal taste. Why are there pickles on the table at a deli? Simple, to cleanse your palette and open your taste buds to the spices to come. Why are all the side on a deli plate kind of creamy? Also simple, to knock out any strong spices in your mouth. It is almost the same idea when you eat Q actually. So, a bite of pickle, a bite of the sandwich and then a bite of the slaw (repeat) creates a great way of maintaining a great tasting meal instead of having the strong pepper (piper nigrum) of a good pastrami sandwich blow out your taste buds. These are Food 101 concepts, but it is surprising how few people understand them and apply them. It is easier to copy a menu than to grok it.",

I love the fact that they offer an abundance of healthy options for breakfast (like egg white omelets!) The food is consistently delicious and the service is always prompt and friendly. I'm a customer almost every weekend!  And this place is ALWAYS busy - definitely a good sign.",

    "text": "We were told about this restaurant by an aquaintance, so decided to give it a try.   We went there today on Sunday.   We were seated and then looked at the menus.  I notice a Bible Quote on the Dry Erase board. The waitress was pleasant, and we ordered something to drink, and looked at the menus.    I had the French Dip, and we also ordered two Hamburgers.   They use a pretzle bread for all the Hamburgers, which we were not so crazy about.   Also, they don't serve fries, and I was craving some, so instead ordered the Hashbrowns.   The French Dip was delicious, and the Au Jus was also pretty good.  I would have liked the Au Jus a little stronger but it was not bad.   They use provolone cheese in their French Dips, and that tasted pretty good.  The Hamburgers with bacon were very tasty.   For three lunches, the tab came to $29.   The place was about 80% full all the while we were there.   We will be back for breakfast.   I do wish they had French Fries though which would have given them a 5 star rating.",

Hopping to stop by again for breakfast before heading back on the road. :)",

The Ultimate French Toast is great-skip the powdered sugar. The Oatmeal Overload is my new favorite-it is only served M-F 8am-11am. It comes with fabulous sides of bananas, granola, raisins,blueberries and brown sugar.  The only bad dish I have had so far is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes-they cook the bananas in the batter, which makes the pancake taste like it is undercooked and gives a bad taste. The Hot tea selection is really good-they bring you a box of Shangri La Tea assortment to choose from. Service is always good. Can be noisy at times, but worth the wait.",

OK so I have to preface my review with the fact that during my visit, I was pretty much KO'ed on the table.. Despite this, the server was super friendly and didn't seem to mind one bit - talk about #nojudgy.  Oh and I would also like to add that I didn't end up eating most of my food until after leaving the restaurant, after I had re-established my livelihood, but this doesn't really make all that much of a difference.  The prices are pretty standard for breakfast foods, about $7-10 per plate.  However, the coffee price was kind of steep at $2.45.  Not the biggest deal in the world except for the fact that I could only get down like half my cup, but I guess that was my fault, not theirs.  It was strange, though, that they only sell bottled juices, which are standard breakfast fare; you'd think they would at least have a juice machine of some sort.  The food was super fresh and they're actually one of the only places ever that has made my eggs perfect over medium, my favorite.  I did find the sausage pretty salty, not to mention they come patty style versus in links, which I prefer.  I like that they give you the option between a banana and hash browns as a side, but we actually ordered both. The potatoes were light and crispy, and the bananas came sliced in a small bowl, which was very convenient.",

Now, you may call me biased since they have the IC bomber sandwich and I went to Ithaca College, but I assure you this only got them 1 of my 4 stars :)   My husband and I generally split the Jacob's slammin platter which is an array of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, breakfast potatoes, and a bagel. More than enough food for the two of us. This place is a bit pricey, but again not so bad if you are splitting. I have also tried the banana cream pancakes and I could eat a vat of the delicious dulce de leche butter. I am also a huge fan of the chicken chipotle wrap, the homemade chipotle ranch is awesome! Their sandwiches are just as good as their breakfast, but there is nothing special about the macaroni or potato salad. I am addicted to french fries and I am always a little disappointed when restaurants don't have a fryer. I wish that they would offer their breakfast potatoes as a side, which they do for an additional fee.   If you wake up this weekend looking for a fabulous brunch, head on down to Sunrise Cafe and you won't be disappointed.",

From the surrounding conversations between patrons & servers I could tell they have a lot of regulars, which is very comforting. The menu is a perfect size. It has enough variety for everyone to find something they'd like but not too big like other breakfast places, sometimes it can just be too overwhelming early in the morning. If you like a nice little spice kick you have to give the jalapeno bacon a try. Our server was Jesse. He's great at what he does. He's very attentive, knowledgeable, & efficient. I think we'll become regulars too.",

The build your own omelette with all without egg whites and so many toppings to choose from totally rocks.  The varieties of pancakes like banana, blueberry, and dulce la leche will cure any sweet tooth.  The corn beef sandwich is delightful and French dip is out of this world.

All i could taste was the blueberry sauce, what a disappointment! I was so worried that the meal would be too sweet, but it wasnt.  I think if you order this meal you should ask for the sauce on the side as a cautionary.  Overall the place is ok and I think it deserves another chance. Perhaps the cinnamon pancakes will be my next choice to try.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my breakfast here this past Sunday, suggested by the lovely Allison S. We got there around 10ish and it was busy, but there was no wait for 2 seats at the counter which we happily took. Our server was nice, he took our drink order then let us browse the menu. They have a big 2 sided menu with breakfast and lunch options. The menu was not too big, not too small, but justttt right. I hate when a menu is a bazillion pages long. One thing that I found odd was there was no side items on the menu for either lunch or dinner. I knew I wanted an egg breakfast, but I thought I might have also wanted pancakes and it would have been nice if there were a side option.   Anyway we both ordered breakfast. My dining companion went with the bagel and lox platter which is essentially just a bagel with cream cheese, lox, and a few toppings. I was in the mood for eggs benedict and Sunrise had 6 different options for me to choose from. I was torn between the veggie benedict and the fiesta benedict, which I ultimately chose. It had jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese and eggs, smothered in a fiesta hollandaise on top of an everything bagel. Both meals came with potatoes that were okay, but I had to douse in ketchup and Frank's chili lime sauce for flavor.  So I've never had eggs benedict served on a bagel before, which you can choose your flavor by the way, and while it was good, it was hard to cut because the bagel was toasted. Sure I could have just shoved the whole thing in my mouth, but I was with company and didn't want to embarrass myself =P. I got to try Allison's bagel and lox, which was loaded up with capers, tomatoes and onions. It was good but something I eat often, and can make at home. I would probably come back here if I were in the area.",

Even with that they were flipping their tables quickly and we only waited 5-10 minutes. Their menu is only one page front and back, but they show a great selection! We each ordered eggs Benedict - I the Brooklyn Benny and my mom the Cajun Prime Rib Benny- and we were as impressed with the size of the plate as we were with the taste.

I've heard of Sunrise Cafe from a few people and we thought we'd pay them a visit.   It was quite busy and people were waiting for tables outside. We wanted take-out so went straight to the cashier to order our food. I got the Garden of Eden omelette. It was an egg white omelette with mushrooms, black olives, red and green bellpeppers, and had avocado, alfalfa sprouts and pepper jack cheese to top it off. I thought it was very delicious. Never had black olives in an omelette before and it was good! I'm pretty olive crazy.. so I'd eat it with anything to be honest. It also came with potatoes, and wheat toast. My boyfriend got some roast beef dip sandwich with coleslaw. He initially said it looked small, which it did, but was actually pretty packed with meat. I didn't try it but it didn't look that great.   Workers were friendly. The lady asked if we wanted water while we waited. We didn't really wait too long. Less than 10 mins and we were on our way.  It sucks that breakfast is soooo expensive when you eat out. Sunrise Cafe & The Griddle are all like $9 for breakfast.. I sometimes don't even eat lunch for that price. OH well. Overall, the food and service is good. I will definitely return, but probably won't be returning back too often. I'll come back next time I have family or friends in and looking for a good place to eat some grub in the early AM.",

We were excited to visit twice in a week's span while visiting with friends. Sunrise Cafe exudes happiness, the food choices are healthy and delicious, and the wait staff couldn't be more accommodating. We look forward to our next visit, which couldn't be soon enough!",

    "text": "My new Sunday breakfast spot! We come in, and its always incredibly busy. Which makes sense because the food is good, but it's nice because there's always plenty of seating to wait for your table. Not to mention, the tables are turned over quickly and even when you have to wait, its never too long of a wait.  My favorite is the corn beef hash and my girls favorite is the Veggie Benny. They're both delicious and I love the fact that you get a bagel with each! Another thing that I like about this restaurant is the service. Its consistently good. Probably my favorite  servers are Amy & Micheal, he's a great guy and is always on it.  I recognized him when I saw he went from the Starbucks next door, to here. I also love the fact that this is a family establishment. The owners are always there and working hard on the weekends and its a big reason why I come here as often as I do. Overall, it's a solid restaurant that I love to support because of its great food, great service, and family atmosphere.",

    "text": "We went to early Sunday mass, so by the time we left church I was craving breakfast. My parents of course know me well, that I would be reluctant to go to a casino buffet primarily due to the foul smoke... not very appetizing while I eat.   Again thanks to Yelp, I was rescued from eating at iHop or Denny's. Well it must have been ~9:30am, and there was already a line. As much as I despise waiting in lines, I knew that usually a line means \"it must be good and worth the wait\".  AND fortuntely this was True for this case.  Their breakfast-lunch menu was impressive. I have to agree with a previous review, I wished they served french fries... skinny fries.  But their home fries was a pretty tasty alternative.  From eyeing the neighboring tables, the omelettes were big or decent size.  I was hungry but didn't want to overeat, since I knew the primary plan for Christmas-Holiday wkends are to eat... so I wanted to pace myself.  So I shared the Greek omelette with my nephew.  I wanted to add more protein but gave him the choice between grilled chicken and steak.  We had the steak and it was delicious... totally hit the spot.  It was also super cool that they didn't charge to split our entrees.  My parents were pleasantly surprised that a yummy breakfast hot-spot was so close to them, but they would have never stopped by to check it out if it wasn't for me Yelping this place:)   Will definitely come here again when I come back and visit!",

I'm impressed this place was so busy considering the stiff competition of dining on Eastern, Henderson. This is a solid 4 Star breakfast/lunch joint that offers a diverse portfolio of eggs, sandwiches, meats and potatoes. This place is very unique in that egg whites seemed to be the preferred favorites. Right away I feel like this is a health conscious diner.   I ordered the Jacob's platter and I must say that you definitely get the best bang for your buck with this item. I'm a man of variety so I do love the option of getting everything I want on a dish without the pesky additional charges. Poached eggs, home potatoes hash, jalepeno bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage patty, silver dollar pancakes, and a cinnamon bagel and cream cheese on the side for $8.99! Throw in a fantastic staff that works well together and you have yourself a fantastic breakfast.   So why not a 5 star? I'm a breakfast/brunch snob. My 5 star brunch needs everything to be home made. Their muffins, bread, bundt cake, toasts and jams are outsourced.  Minus one.",

Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.  I highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty.   The omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft/medium yolk.   I would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat.   Brunch proper my friends.",

The food was delicious I created my own omelette and had hash browns which were amazing . I choose to get a pancake and it was disgusting taste like it was just microwaved next time I'll stick to a bagel or toast . My boyfriend got French toast and he enjoyed it . The food was 5 stars our server was more like a 1 star very unengaged and a little bit on the arrogant side .",

Brooklyn Benedict was fresh and well made, and the addition of the house made sour cream citrus hollandaise had a nice soft kick that really was lovely and luxurious. The huevos rancheros wrap was fresh and not over stuffed or sloppy and the hash browns were crispy deliciousness. Freshly made coffee choices included Hawaiian hazelnut and the refills were forthcoming and I never saw the bottom of my mug. Great vibe and super clean and well maintained restroom (ladies I can vouch for, at least) lol! Great way to end a little Vegas dash!",

I absolutely love that the server always asks if we want to split our meals! We seriously don't have to ask for extra plates because they almost always assume and are correct that we like to share each other's meals.  The Cajun Eggs Benny is super good too! I have knack for anything eggs benny, but I do crave that specifically.  Too bad I don't live close to OSC. I live on the NW side of town and only like to come here if I happen to be on the south visiting my sister.  Other than that, I'd highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast and brunch. I have yet to try their lunch menu.",

It is on a fresh Keiser roll, loaded with thin prime rib and hollandaise sauce, with a side of fresh potatoes. Wife and I shared it and also got the crunch berry French toast which was a trip down memory lane bc my favorite sugar Leiden cereal was captain crunch crunch berries! Next time if I get it I will definitely tell them to layoff the powdered sugar a bit but still a very unique and tasty dish. It comes with a blueberry cream  cheese dalop and syrup. The coffee here is pretty good and the service was super friendly and he was on point throughout the entire breakfast. Also the patio is dog friendly so feel free to bring Rover with you on your next breakfast outting when you give this place a try.",

    "text": "First impression: From the outside of the building it looks like just another diner. Although, from the amount of people standing and sitting waiting for a table, it looks a bit small. Don't let that impression fool you. It's of a very decent size inside.  It took us about 30 min to get seated, during Sunday morning Brunch.  Staff: Staff were on cue, bussing tables, seating guests and taking orders. When we got seated our server came over right away to get our drinks(Wish I could remember his name....he was awesome). Within seconds, not kidding, we had our coffee and we're looking at their menu.   ((I will add on a personal opinion, I believe the physical size of the menu is too big, should slim it down a bit. Kind of gets in the way. ))  After about 3 minutes he came back to take our order. I was quite surprised at his consistently. It was a very full house and he was right on top of things.  We gave our order and he was off to the kitchen !  Cleanliness: Even with the amount of people in the restaurant, they managed to keep it clean. I did not see any trash on the floors (I was looking for this review), the tables were cleared promptly, and of there was a spill...the staff were on top of it.   Food: Definitely good quality food. I got a  create-your-own omelette. It was delicious. Proof in the pictures ;). It was cooked perfectly, and I had zero complaints about the quality of it. They have these little Cinnamon French toast bite things....OMG...out of this world.   The owner ended up making his way over to the table to refill our coffee. That in it self made the whole experience for me. We talked for a few minutes about hockey, and you could tell he had passion, not only about the sport but about his business. Him stopping by the table and filling out coffee, shows that he genuinely cares about the customer experience. A move that is all to forgotten this day in age to show the appreciation and caring of the restaurant.  I've been here twice in the last few years and will return for sure. If you're looking for a mom and pop place to get some good breakfast or lunch....this is it. Check out this cafe....",

(Wish I could have remembered his name)  We tried the Snow Caps to start and OMG THOSE THINGS ARE THE BEST TINY FRENCH TOAST IVE EVER HAD!!! Definitely try them with the icing + raspberry dipping it'll make it 10x better than syrup! (He recommended) the food was overall great, I love mom and pop shops like these and everyone there was very attentive and kind! The waiter even stopped by with refilled drinks before we could even ask for a refill which was AMAZING. Love love love this place! I can't wait to be back for more!",

The eggs benny are off the charts. I love the fact that they use a bagel instead of an English muffin. Two reasons, one, bagels are awesome, far more awesome than silly little English muffins. Two, you get more grub, because bagels are bigger, and better. The breakfast potatoes that they come with are really good too, mixed with onions and peppers. On this day I chose my benny to be over an everything bagel. One small critique, it could use a little more hollandaise, because that stuff is bomb.   Pricing is decent here, along the lines of other breakfast establishments. It always gets me paying almost the same for breakfast as you do for dinner. But hey, good food is good food. Life is too short to eat bad breakfastes.   Service is always outstanding and the iced tea is tasty!",

I finally decided to try Sunrise cafe out. I was craving for a lot.   I ordered a BLT: extra Bacon, add mushrooms, add avocado, add grilled onions. With a side salad with Caesar dressing and a cup of bananas and blueberries. I knew my order was complicated. However they were able to accommodate my special order.   I paid a little under $20 for my meal . And omg they had Whoopie pies! I never had them but pumpkin was what caught my eye and made my mouth water.   The food smelled amazing. I was ready to devour everything in the car because the aroma was soooo good. But guess what I couldn't resist? A bite of that same whoopie pie! I had to stop myself from eatin because I wanted to eat my BLT. LET ME TELL YOU THIS!!! THIS WAS THW BEST BLT THAT WAS EVER MADE IN MY LIFE, ESPECIALLY WITH CRAVING ADDITIONS!  One thing I was unsatisfied about what that my side of blueberries and bananas was that the blue berries weren't fresh, it kinda tasted frozen or preserved.   OVERALL, I ENJOYED my food and I DEFINITELY will COME BACK AND TRY OTHER THINGS !",

The service has always been good. The food has always been good. I love the atmosphere here. I'm a basic eggs and avocado with bacon kind of girl. So can't say that I've ordered much else.",

Food was good , did not like how the workers were looking at me & my friend the moment we walked in / even paying our checks being that we were one of the very few or if only colored people around during the time . Workers especially the Men I'm sorry BOYS were snobby just as much as the customers dining . Tragic .   Which brings to problem number two : while walking inside , to pay for the tab ( mind u it's my first time here  ) don't know How things worked around there and the host podium literally takes up / blocks the walk way so I didn't know where to pay which is why I was being patience and nice to even wait to ask . Once I hand him the receipt , he gives us an attitude and it's not one where he's trying to be slick his face just went straight while rolling his eyes and says \" you're paying \" we said yes and he just goes \" OK ?\" While rolling his eyes and his arms extended . Worst employee ever , can't even fake a good customer service at least. Don't plan on coming back .",

I also had an omelet I don't like when places put the cheese on top but that's me. Other than that it was decent.",

There was a wait, which is expected on a Sunday for brunch, the service was friendly and quick.  The food though.... OMG... Stuff it all into my mouth right now! From the amazing crunch berry french toast to the kickass, fill up my mouth until I want to die of happiness Cajun prime rib eggs Benedict, we were impressed and overjoyed to have come! The coffee is even pretty damn good!  The cherry on top? They have a little bucket of toys for the kids to choose from at the end of the meal. It was just a little thing that leaves a lasting impression. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll seek this place out again.",

As far as the food, Phil Robertson would call it Yupified.  It was not your bacon/eggs/toast  type place. They have that, but, their specialties are their wraps, benedicts, and omelets. Their menu was an adventure. It takes a great deal of time to review the menu because of the vast selection. Food was great, as ordered, hot and fast. These people do it right. Great job!!!!!",

Every once in a while I'll branch out & try something different, today I had banana cream pie pancakes...WOW! The bananas are sliced & cooked Into the batter, then topped with slices & pecans. They were so moist & delish I didn't bother with syrup! They come with whipped maple butter, it's so yummy you can simply eat it! Not that I did, just saying it's an option! The eggs are always cooked exactly as ordered. It's not rocket science but it does seem to be a lot to ask in many restaurants to get your eggs as ordered, but that's not the case here. On the weekends they serve homemade oatmeal, it's a big draw so go early because once it's gone, it's gone. My hubby loves the stuff. FYI there's always a wait, but it's so worth it.",

Another thing that bothered me was the employees all seem dressed to casual to know who's who from the guest.  As a business they should be dressed all in uniformity to each other and be well groomed to clearly identify themselves to the public eye.  Several servers looked as of they had just rolled out of bed, forgot to shave, and comb there hair.  This is just one of pet peeves since I own a retail establishment.",

There were 4 of us, and we were all happy. The service was good and attentive, and the food was decent for one of those diner spots.  I had a hard time wrapping my brain around the portion sizes again. I ordered a veggie omelet that, in addition to being huge, came with a side of hash browns equally as huge. AND an entire BAGEL! It might have been offered as my toast option, but wow. A whole bagel! I think I made it through about 60-65% of what was in front of me and left overly stuffed. My partner had a breakfast burrito with a much more sane portion size and much easier to finish. It was super-tasty except for the TOO many jalapenos. He picked them off and was still suffering through the spice. So rec'd only for those who love that kick.",

For a place with many healthy options, this is a behemoth of a breakfast:  eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, canadian bacon, silver dollar pancakes, and a bread (I always choose the everything bagel toasted).  80% of the time I order this, the other 20% I get the crispy creamy wrap, an egg/bacon/cream cheese wrap.  Again served with their potatoes, which are fantastic when ordered extra crispy.  My wife typically gets Chester's Way, their corned beef hash dish.  This is another huge meal, we always take some home even with me helping...  I would arrive earlier in the day if possible, the wait can get long at high peak times on the weekend due to its popularity.  Also, they do run out of bread choices, which we found out the hard way a few times.  During nice weather, sitting outside on the patio can be fun, but it's RIGHT by the parking lot.  So, car noise/exhaust can be an issue. Dogs are welcome on the patio.  Service is fantastic.  They have a lot of servers that have been there for years, which I think is indicative of how they run the business.  Be advised it's good for kids, but no changing table in the bathrooms.",

We were seated inside immediately. The service was great and we received our food fast and hot.  I am an eggs Benedict nut and I love Sunrise's selection with their twist on this breakfast classic. My other favorite breakfast place is GVR 's Pancake house and I will have to say even though Sunrise isn't as fancy as Pancake house, their food is just as good with less of a wait.",

Whereas Hash House is that cute girl you spend too much money on,  this place is like the loyal girl next door thats always there for you,  but easy to take for granted. Luckily Ive realized my folly and always make a stop when I am back in town.   A very diverse menu,  but you can make your own breakfast and its not a problem-UNLIKE other places where a custom order brings that underhanded chain of sighs from the server to the first line cook all the way down until it ends back up on your table.  Now it feels like your custom order is weighed down with a little extra guilt or sarcasm.  Back to the lecture at hand,  I highly recommend this place when you want a break from the usual breakfast joints,  the buffets and want something REAL.   Come with friends,  the coffee is always topped off and you'll walk away wondering why you didn't come any sooner.",

    "text": "We had family visiting and staying in Henderson who wanted to meet for breakfast. I, being the faithful Yelper that I am, looked for a good spot to try since our favorites are near us in SW Las Vegas. The Original Sunrise Cafe is a solid place and got the job done. They were very busy but still managed to get out food out  quickly and be attentive to our needs throughout the meal. The menu selections are pretty standard for breakfast with some spins on classic items like their \"Bueno\" and \"Brooklyn\" eggs benedict. I ordered the \"Garden of Eden\" omelet, and thought it was decent, it needed some love...or maybe just salt. I really liked the potatoes. They were shredded, but in a wider form than I've seen before, and yummy. My partner in crime got the corn beef hash and ate the whole thing. So, I say give it a try and you probably will not be disappointed; but, I think I'll save the gas next time I want breakfast and go somewhere closer to home.",

It's not glitzy, but that's the charm, it's run by a guy who cares and he spreads that philosophy to his staff.  Our coffee cups were never empty, and our bellies were full.  I had the Jacob slam (or something like that), and it was delicious; my eggs were perfectly done.  I can't tell you the times I order \"over hard\" and get a runny mess.  This was just right.  It came with a small fruit bowl (or potatoes), bagel, sausage patty, canadian bacon, and strip bacon, all of which were cooked just right.  We had some really average, or below average food in Vegas, and we didn't expect that one of our best meals would be at this unassuming cafe in a strip mall.  I recommend coming here for a breakfast in a pleasant environment, that wont cost you much, and the food is good!",

We didn't want to hassle with the strip, and I was really in the mood for a French themed hoorah, so I used yelp to find somewhere in SE LV, and O M G. I could not have been more happier with any other breakfast! I got the Garden of Eden omelette ( I think that's what it was called?) without olives and mushies cause I don't fly with that. It was so amazing. I was thoroughly impressed with the service, the food, and the large cup of coffee that my server kept hot. The meal came with delicious taters, and a bagel too. I usually never finish a whole breakfast, but I couldn't resist finishing this one. It was the best breakfast I have had in a really long time. My boyfriend got the bagel with lox or whatever it is and reported that it was very delicious as well. 5 stars for being the most absolutely perfect breakfast after one night in Vegas. We left on a really good impression.",

I kept my order pretty basic as I don't eat pancakes, bagels, or any of the other breakfast goodies... but I can say that the menu options looked AWESOME.  Buffalo chicken omelet with blue cheese?  Are you kidding me?  Can I roll up inside and eat my way out?  I opted for a build-your-own with steak, avocado, and jalapenos.  Jalapenos.  The only time I've seen jalapenos as an option for something is pizza.  And now they are in my omelet... and they are good!  I would love to come back and try one of the menu omelet creations - I can't imagine anything tasting bad here.  Another big plus - the giant box of hot tea selections!  Its so nice to see options for tea, especially at breakfast.  +one star JUST for the tea!  Next time I'm in the area, I will make effort to get back here for breakfast.  Prices, service, atmosphere - all a nice change of pace from the LV Strip.",

Very friendly and relaxed service.  Great fresh food.   Lotsa unique twists on traditional favorites here.

We were there on a Thursday at about ten AM. The place was busy but we were seated almost immediately. The menu had a lot of choices for a place that's only open for breakfast and lunch. i ordered the eggs Benedict. The price was at least three dollars cheaper than the same dish where I live. Our water glass was immediately filled and it was filled, without asking, the whole time we were there. The same is True for the coffee. Along with the eggs, they served potatoes with onions. They were some of the best that I have ever tasted. The eggs were delicious. They were completely covered with sauce. In most restaurants I'm lucky if I get a spoonful! Our waiter, Jeff, was super friendly and very attentive. Now this is a real treat. I hate to say it but most of the wait staff in local restaurants here are rude or in an extreme hurry to get you out. Several other people came by to see how we were doing. There is no doubt that I will stop by here on my next trip to Vegas. If you're from California the land of the almighty dollar, you're in for a treat. By the way the restroom was spotless. I checked the grout. There wasn't a spot anywhere!",

This place is usually busy in the morning with folks coming over from the nearby Athletic Club. It's a good spot to sit, relax, eat a tasty breakfast and people watch. It's not uncommon for someone to bring there dog and eat outside. Not the best place if you are in a hurry or want solitude.",

It's nothing fancy, but the food is tasty, and the service is so friendly. After only a few visits, the staff came to recognize us and remember our favorite dishes. Of course, our favorite of all time turned out to be the fiesta benedict, featuring said jalapeno bacon and a spicy hollandaise sauce. I also really appreciated their flexibility; anytime I wanted to customize anything on the menu (such as, say, adding jalapeno bacon) it was always no problem. I loved that all their benedicts came on bagels rather than muffins, and that we could get sliced bananas as a side. Other than their benedicts, we really enjoyed their morning wraps and omelettes (especially the Davezilla omelette with amazing garlic sauce). We even went for lunch there once and had some delicious burgers. Now that we've moved, we certainly miss this place!",

I did get the potatoes instead of fruit, (I have to be a little bad right??)

I consider myself a vegetable freak and this is one of the rare breakfast places where you can find genuinely good veggies in a lot of the main entrees.   The omelettes are praise worthy and although the Garden of Eden could be tempting for you health enthusiasts I would recommend the Davezilla. The veg-overload in the Garden of Eden is hardcore for even me but the Davezilla is still healthy with some spice to offset the bland.   I have never been disappointed with the create your own salad and whenever anyone at my table gets the signature muffin I hear about it for the rest of the meal. They look delicious and always come out piping hot! If one of my friends was writing this they would rave for hours.... Maybe I should just try one?!  If you don't get there early there could be a wait but nothing unbearable. I love the outdoor seating and I think it's great that they have a mini 'treasure chest\" for kids to pick a treat out of.  Overall, I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have yet to find a breakfast place that can top it.",

It was very difficult to hear each other, or to even think.   I had the original eggs Benedict, and he ordered the classic breakfast.  Eggs Benedict: the eggs were not poached, and you could tell that they had touched a frying pan. The hollandaise sauce was a little lackluster, and lacked flavor. The ham was nothing to rant or rave about.  The classic breakfast: something that you can easily make at home. The bacon was a little funky tasting, and did not leave him wanting more.  When the waitress left the bill, she realized I had barely touched my plate and asked if it was all right. Not wanting confrontation, or expecting anything for free, I stated it was OK. She asked me to be honest with her, at which point I stated that the bagel was the star of the dish. She quickly took the plate to someone in the back, who then quickly came out and apologized, and ended up taking the meal off the ticket. I certainly appreciate the gesture, but I was also willing to pay.   Overall, we won't be returning.",

The meat was tender and the sauce was out of this world. All the eggs and meat were piled on top of garlic toast which really sealed the deal. They have a huge menu with breakfast and lunch selections  The decor in the restaurant is very eccentric. They also have abstract art paintings on the wall for sale. There are a lot of religious pieces inside. It didn't bother me at all, but I can see how it would be a little overbearing for some.  We were quick to be seated and the staff was beyond friendly.

You'll be sure to be searching for a parking spot and be waiting to be seated if you come later in the morning as this place is family friendly, beefcake friendly from LVAC next door, and dog friendly.  Their menu has been exactly the same as far as I can remember but is consistently executed well. They have a create your own omelette section to accompany your standard breakfast options. There are some creative French toast selections and benedicts served on bagels. If you're leaning toward something on the sweet side, I would recommend one of the French toasts. On our most recent visit, I went with the Crunchberry French toast which definitely brought back some childhood memories, with actual crushed Crunchberries. My wife created her own omelette which included her choice of three items which were spinach, bacon, and mushrooms served with potatoes  The hosts are efficient at seating the tables and the servers handle the volume quite well, but are sure to have occasional absences because of the number of tables they are covering. We've never had an issue with the kitchen as they handle the number of orders well also.   Prices probably average between the $9 and $10 range which I think is fair considering the portion sizes. If you're in the area, and see that there is no line, I would stop by because they  consistently provide a good experience.",

Everything on top was really good, but the chips themselves were Ruffles (exact brand unknown), but you know what kind of chips they are right?  I thought they would be some house-made chips capable of carrying the toppings, but I only found 3 viable chips, all the rest were sogged out and had to be forked.  Big disappointment, but my bagel was great and so was my coffee.  No change in stars as it's the only thing I haven't thoroughly enjoyed in my 3 visits.  Original Post:  Our local friends highly recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  Slight wait at 11:30 on a Saturday which was surprisingly shorter than we expected.  Great patio area where many had their dogs with them.  We were seated at the counter which we never prefer but we're starving and so we took it (they did ask us when we put our name in if the counter was ok).  It was a bit noisy at the counter but not terrible. I mention this only if you are going to have a catch-up conversation with an old friend vs just catching a bite.  The entire staff seemed to be having a blast at work and were great.  My hubby got the philly and was in love from the first bite.  I had the corned beef hash and it was very good and huge.  Definitely will make another visit before going home.",

I ordered plain bagel in my eggs benedict and got an everything bagel, hubby didn't get the correct items in his create your own omelette. Nothing that would ruin a meal but a little annoying.  Hubby used to love the Crunchberry French Toast.  On this visit it did not live up to what he remembered.  You couldn't taste any Crunchberry flavor.  It tasted like regular french toast with a berry sauce.  There are a few pluses, you can get half orders of french toast and service is always friendly.",

She came over to take the final copy of the check and saw the tip I left and decided to give me a dirty look. Classless and unprofessional.

It was our first time here. YELP BROUGHT US HERE :)   We ordered the Turkey Links & Eggs as well as the Crunchberry French Toast. The Turkey links were perfectly cooked. They weren't greasy or overcooked & dried out. The flavor was great. The potatoes had a nice, crisp finish to them. And the Crunchberry French Toast.... OH. MY. GOD. Seriously to die for. They serve it with a blueberry cream cheese frosting & powdered sugar. They also brought around a blueberry jam/syrup. It's made in house, btw! The flavors just really blended perfectly.   We will be back very soon!  Definitely recommend.",

I promptly forgot about it and then saw it again a few days ago and decided that I needed to give it a try.   My husband I arrived at the prime breakfast time. Prime breakfast time is apparently 10:30 a.m. for those that are wondering. We got on the waiting list and were told it'd be about 25 minutes. It ended up taking this long, but was worth the wait.   I had the Cajun Prime Rib Beni. This was a delicious combination of Texas Toast, prime rib, onions, mushrooms, and hollandaise sauce. Yum. The meat was delicious and sliced thin which was the perfect consistency for a dish like this. There was also Cajun seasoning on top that really added to the dish without overwhelming it. I also loved the hashbrowns served on the side and found that ketchup was unnecessary.   My husband had the Steak & Egg Wrap. It was tasty, but definitely not the most exciting thing on the menu. My husband loved it.   The service was friendly and efficient. Our waitress took good care of us and didn't leave us wondering where she was at any point. Her other table was a group of 20 and she still gave us great service.",

Not this one. But beware, it is very sweet.   Potato hash was burnt (see picture).

They get your order correct and pay attention to your dietary needs if you are restricted on certain allergy related foods.   We've tried many of the dishes on menu and have favorites. Once you find you're go to dish it's hard to break out and sample new fare!

I shared an order of there banana pie pancakes because they looked irresistible and the hunger was real that morning lol!  My friend decided on a healthier meal and ordered the famous oatmeal with a nice amount of blueberries and bananas.  The breakfast came out quick and everything was on point.

Nonetheless, I'm glad not a lot of people know about this place. It is a hidden gem.   Walking in, I was greeted by the most warm, welcoming faces. Everyone was wearing a \"Be Kind\" shirt, which if you didn't know, is a Las Vegas originated organization by the Josh Stevens Foundation to be more kind. It was amazing to see everyone in this attire and to ultimately show that actions speak louder than words. It's one thing for a company to say they support an organization, but it's a completely different ballpark when a company truly takes initiative to showcase their beliefs.  I was unable to get my servers name, but she was amazing. Super attentive and super friendly.   I was told they're known for their Banana Bread Pudding French Toast, but something about the Prime Rib Beni tickled my funny bone, because most places can't cook the prime rib right. Either too rubbery or too underdone.  Getting the Prime Rib Beni was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life, not even exaggerating. It brought me to a childhood that only memories can explain. The best bagel I've ever had in a Benedict. (Pro tip: get it with the poached egg rather than scrambled. I believe it made it 100% better.)   This place is unmatched. Thanks for the great breakfast!",

Right as I sit down he tells me the waiter spilled water on him, I'm sure it was an accident. Moving on I noticed I had no menu so I grabbed one from the bartender and sat back down. Ryan ordered two eggs sunny side up, with Canadian bacon, sourdough toast, 3dollar size pancakes, and black coffee. He said the coffee wasn't the best but it was drinkable lol.  I ordered the Californian omelette egg whites, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and avocado. I replaced my toast for a banana, the server was kind enough to offer the replacement.

I like how the waitress got a bucket for the kids to pick out toys or candy.",

I came here with my 9yr old and my 8month old daughters on a Thursday around noon. We were sat down relatively quickly and didn't have to wait long to place our order. I had the crunch berry French toast and a side of potatoes and my daughter had the kids scramble with bacon. For me and my daughters meal the price was under $30 so I would say it was very affordable. We will for sure be back!",

They were prompt, the servers were attentive, and there wasn't anything baffling that stood out that wasn't simply personal preference.  However, that simply raises it's level slightly.  I ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast, which was tiny and I made it a platter with bacon and eggs.  This place is not like Black Bear or Baby Stacks where the combinations are possible at a price that is fair.  I think I overpaid for what I ordered by a large margin...which brings me to why I rated it 3 stars.  It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, it didn't anger me, but it left me feeling empty.  I would call that ironic if I weren't still hungry after spending $15 for bacon, eggs, and French Toast.  I should have went with the platter, but hindsight is completely useless.  If I return, I'll get the platter, but I don't see myself doing so.",

    "text": "Sunrise Cafe is our favorite place for breakfast in Las Vegas. We come here probably twice a month, despite the 20+ minute drive from our house.   Service: The service is typically excellent. After our first meal at Sunrise, we told our server that it was our first time and everything was delicious and we would definitely be back. Shortly after, the owner came over to welcome us and to say thank you. She's a really friendly, genuine person. Whenever there's a wait, she'll go around with a treat, like banana bread, to give to the waiting customers. There usually is a wait, especially on weekend mornings, but the service is so efficient that I've never waited more than 15 minutes. The last time we were there, one of the hostesses was unfortunately pretty snippy with us. It was such a shame because we usually are met with nothing but genuine friendliness. Perhaps she was having a bad morning.   Food: The food is consistently fresh and tasty. I usually get the Jacob's Slammin' Platter, which is two eggs, bacon, canadian bacon, sausage, silver dollar pancakes, potatoes, and toast or bagel. It's like a breakfast sampler. The potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend gets the Bueno Beni, which is eggs benedict over a bagel with jalapeno hollandaise and cheese. It's a delicious, spicy indulgence. The kitchen is also really good about modifying if you have any dietary restrictions, so don't be afraid to ask if you want to make any changes. The orange juice is really sweet, so I tend to get a small size rather than the very big large. Price-wise, it's so affordable, especially considering the quality and portion-sizes.   Atmosphere: Great, bustling atmosphere. It's lively and fun and fast-paced, but I've never felt rushed. Sunrise is like a diner in that it is quick, as well as welcoming and casual. You can see straight into the kitchen to watch your food being prepared, especially if you sit at the counter.",

The waiter was incredibly friendly and executed each of our special requests perfectly.   Complaints:  egg was basted a bit too hard, it took forever to get a table and the food took a long time to come out. This is really to be expected at an awesome breakfast place at 10am on Saturday morning. They also had a tough time with a group of six at a really busy time, like almost everywhere. It was much less busy by noon, and looked like it wouldn't have been bad had we gotten there early.   All things considered I would definitely go again, and probably will work my way through most of the menu.",

    "text": "We were in from out of town and we're looking for a breakfast place off the strip, as we've done before, we checked Yelp and this place was well rated. We were impressed with several things including a very clean establishment, very personable staff, terrific food including having things come out just as ordered: crisp bacon and hash browns, overstuffed sandwiches, yellow mustard (not deli nor Dijon - but they were available if we had wanted that), coffee cups constantly refilled without having to look for wait staff and so on. Just an overall really good experience. The prices were reasonable (not cheap). Next time in Vegas I'd go again in a heartbeat. The only negative (for us) was that it wasn't totally convenient to us, but since we had a car it wasn't a big deal.",

    "text": "As much as it pains me to write a POOR review, I truly feel this one is very well deserved. I met with friends here for breakfast expecting to have a relaxing morning filled with great food and company, instead what our group received was quite the opposite. Upon reviewing the menu I was a bit stumped as to why most all of the omelettes were $13. bucks a piece. Since I had never been here before I figured these were going to be big, fluffy and loaded omelettes like the one's at Original Pancake...I couldn't wait! After we ordered from an absolutely no personality waiter, we quite literally NEVER saw him again for the entire meal. In fact the entire experience from that point became without service and quite SELF SERVICE!   Now on to the food...The pastrami omelette was essentially and empty, flat, two egg piece of misery filled with absolutely nothing but nasty grilled onions. Pastrami? What pastrami? The Caesar salad was small, contained too much dressing, very little LOW QUALITY lettuce and had NO love put into it's preparation. Back to the service, they took my bagel away to put cream cheese on it as I had ordered it and never came back. No waiter to tell, no drink refills once ever during the meal. I actually had to get up and go over to the front counter to ask for my bagel, some ketchup, drink refills and to let them know of the disappearance of our waiter. They acted with very little concern, but did finally bring the things I had asked for. Bagel arrived 3/4's of the way through my crappy omelette. My other guests food was prepared with Slop Shop style and the chefs (I mean guys off the street) were obviously preparing food as if they were making food for their dorm buddies.   Overpriced crappy food (BTW - Menu pics on here are 30% less than current prices).  Absolutely non-caring service staff (Might have been better off in an old folks home cafeteria). Chefs that aren't actually chefs, rather Slop Shop egg flingers. And finally, NO SERVICE, and I mean NONE once waiter took the order.  I truly cannot believe the Overrated Hype and reviews this place has received! Is it that so many people have just come to expect mediocre at best service, food and high prices due to their food inexperience? Could it be that the patrons of this establishment no nothing of good food, good service and value? Or has everyone just come to expect third-world quality in this day and age here in Vegas? I'm sooooo conflicted about these questions. I wish people were more accurate when describing their experiences through this format. If so, I would have NEVER wasted my time here.  If you want real breakfast in Vegas, go to Weiss Deli, Original Pancake, or even any casino coffee shop. This terrible food is a direct reflection of customers willingly allowing such an establishment to continue to succeed. Folks...Please complain on the spot about crappy food, bad service and overpriced garbage. I have no issues paying dearly for excellent quality food, but honestly an Egg McMuffin would have much better satisfied my breakfast desires than this place! Sunrise Cafe - Good Luck To You!",

We got the patty melt and the eggs and hash dish. Both were large portions and delicious. I really liked the vibe of this place too, very inviting and open, bright colors.

I though the dish was flavorable and had a kick, which was what I was looking for. I poured a little of the Hollandaise over it but nothing near what it could have been.

I needed to refuel before hitting my drive back to SoCal. There was a little bit of a wait, but the reassuring smiles, kind acknowledgment  from the staff made it bearable. On to what we came here for.... THE FOOD! I would describe it as AMAZING. With many categories to choose from, every one in our 8 person party was pleased. I enjoyed the Ultimate English toffee French toast, and almost couldn't finish. It was just so good that I couldn't stop. Not only is this place a breakfast lovers dream, but our vegetarian friends were over the moon at the menu that considered them so wonderfully. So if you're looking for a down home, grandma's kitchen Sunday breakfast... Make sure you stop at the OSC. My Vegas return trips will definitely have these guys on the agenda!",

Healthy options are plentiful. Kind of a hipster feel which is whatever but the food and service are killer. Almost like a general store inside with vintage candies and soda pops for sale. Interesting and fun. Staff seems to have a cool family vibe, everyone working together. Great location on 215 and Eastern. Very happy with my experiences here",

I'm cheap so the prices were a little high at first.   But the portion sizes, flavor, and atmosphere really make up for it.     We had the LEO sandwich,  a banana pancakes,  a bagel and the snow caps for breakfast.   Everything was delicious!   For lunch we had the kids pizza,  Cajun Benedict,  hamtastic sandwich,  the French dip with prime rib, and the pumpkin cream cheese cake.   Again a home run.   We prefer the mac salad to the potato salad but both are yummy.   The French dip is a little salty with the aus jus but most and flavorful without.  The pesto on the ham sandwich took it over the top yummy!   And the kids scarfs down the dessert.   I probably wouldn't go out of the way to get here as the lines can be long and the bathrooms are one holers, but when in in the area,  I'll definitely be back.",

The hearty, spicy and savory meat is brilliantly contrasted with a thick and rich house version of hollandaise on a soft steak sandwich roll.  Wow, a fabulous breakfast entree!    On the sweeter side there is a good variety of pancakes, french toast concoctions, etc.  Sweet breakfast foods are not my preference; however, the other guests in my party were delighted with their confectionery breakfast entrees.    Reminds me slightly of a New York Diner but has a California breakfast atmosphere...if that makes any sense at all.    Decor has many positive references to faith.  Clearly they believe in what they do which includes serving GREAT FOOD!    Highly Recommend.",

I ordered the crunch berry French toast and he confirmed that it was an awesome choice. That only added to my excitement. I also ordered a side of sausage and a coffee.   First off the serving of French toast was huge. Not obscene like some places but very large. The crunch berries were pulverized into an almost dust like coating that the slices had been dipped into. Giving it delicious flavor but not adding a whole lot of  crunchy texture like I was expecting. However, it worked really well and had tons of berry flavor. There was also berry syrup and cream cheese icing drizzled on top. It was sweet but enjoyably so. I loved it.   My side of sausage was two large very thin patties that I could not finish. They were huge ! Overall my grand total with the coffee was $16. And I easily could've taken a full serving home. excellent first experience and I will definitely be back to try more French toast!",

We both ordered egg benedicts (Veggie for mom and Brooklyn for me). Completely amazing! What is also amazing is the sesame bagel which my benedict was served on! The eggs were cooked to perfection! Needless to say we had such a nice time minus the noise level. BUT I can definitely see the hype for this place! Great food and I definitely will be back to try other items on the menu especially those banana cream pie pancakes!!!",

Accompanied on the side were slices of pickles and I chose a side of potato salad.  Thiis meal was super!  Toasted, buttered Rye, melted swiss, salted ham and the mustard really tied everything together.  The potato salad was not too creamy and had a lot of potato chunks.  I enjoyed my meal a lot.

One thing that helps me rate whether the server is good or not is how well they refill the drinks.  She refilled the drinks when our current drinks were half full without us asking for one!    Other things is that the place was clean and spacious.  The restrooms were clean as well.  All in all it was a nice place to dine.

We were 8th on the waiting list to be seated, and it took 10-15 minutes before our table was ready.   We both ordered the Jacobs platter: two eggs, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage, potatoes, silver dollar pancakes, and toast for $8.99.  The server asked if I would like bananas instead of potatoes, which is perfect for me because I don't like potatoes with my breakfast.   The only downside of the meal was the wait time for our food. We were both starving, and it took 20-25 minutes until the food arrived. However, it was worth the wait!  Everything was delicious. We finished everything in our plates, and left full and satisfied.   Service was great. Smiles all around. Will return",

But, the hollandaise makes the bagel softer so it actually kind of has the same texture as an English muffin with the soft center and harder shell. I'm picky about my hollandaise and this joint has a good one. Service was good and quick!",

We arrived with a party of 5 on a Sunday morning around 10 am. There was about a 10-15 minutes wait but we got in fast. They offer us some sample of their blueberry muffin, which was super moist, while we waited.   On the menu: They have morning creations, french toast, and pancakes, wraps, sunrise benedicts, create your own omelet, regular omelets, salads, create your own salad, sunrise burgers, sunrise specialty sandwiches and sunrise lunch wraps. Pretty good selection for everyone.   I have been eyeing all the pictures for a long time and I knew what I wanted before I even got here. I wanted the sunrise benedicts. These benedicts are served not with an English muffin, these babies were served with a bagel. YUM. I love bagels. I ended up getting the bueno beni. The bueno beni is an open-faced bagel with jalapenos, onions, sausage patties, cheese, perfectly cooked eggs with the yolk running with salsa verde hollandaise sauce. This was soo good. My friend got the fiesta benedict and the sauce was delish. You are able to choose what type of bagel you wanted and of course, I went with an everything bagel. MMMMM..soo good!   Service was top notch. Everything was super nice and everyone was really welcoming.   Overall, I would come back again and again.",

It was alittle packed which is typically so me and a friend had to squeeze into those small two person tables (sandwiched between two larger tables) that everyone hates. The service is phenomenal and multiple people checked on us. You can tell they have a system down to check on all the guests. As for the food it was typical breakfast fair. I had the French toast and my friend had the breakfast classic. Breakfast was tasty however I was disappointed they didn't have any vegan options not even a tofu scramble or something easy. I'm vegetarian and transitioning over so I'd have like to see more choices especially since the menu was pretty big. If you want vegan you're stuck with potatoes and a side salad.  overall nice breakfast choice and I'd come back",

    "text": "Breakfast for lunch?  Yes, of course.  I love breakfast food!  I've been a fan of Sunrise Cafe since this first time I step foot in here.  And guess what?  They specialize in just breakfast.  You can pretty much find all types of breakfast items at Sunrise Cafe.  Their menu consist of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast, sandwiches, wraps, Benedicts, oatmeal, and even burgers.  My go-to meal is the Jacob's Slammin' Platter for $8.99 (eggs, silver dollar pancakes, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage, potatoes, and choice of bread).  You really can't go wrong with that order.  Lately, I've been keeping it simple with a BYO Omelet for $8.99 or just 8 eggs with bacon.  \"The Lighter Side of Guilt\" is also on their menu, which is their healthier portions and lower calorie meals.  But who has time for that.  I have no complaints with the food.  The prices are great and the service has always been excellent.      TIP #1:  $2 upcharge for egg whites.  TIP #2:  MAKE IT A MONSTER for an additional $3.25. They'll hook up the omelets.  TIP #3:  2 stars for the parking.  TIP #4:  This place can get really busy during the weekend mornings.  But it's perfect during lunch in the middle of the week.  TIP #5:  Country Potatoes Extra Crispy!!  TIP #6:  Try the Snow Caps (buttered fried bagel bites covered with cinnamon sugar). YOLO!     2017 Yelp Review #32",

We sat near an area where you could see the grill where they cook potatoes and the floor was messy with food, bus tubs, dirty safety mats.  They really need a bigger area.  So cleaning stuff stays in the cleaning area and cooking stuff stays with the cooking area.  Break down and spend the money to disassemble the pizza stove in the back area and reconfigure your restaurant.",

I told myself the second time that I would order something different... but the fiesta Benedict is just so goooood! It comes with jalapeno bacon & im not sure if that's what makes the world of difference??? Lol but it's delicious. Their hash brown or house potatoes, whichever one I ordered, was really really good. Some parts were crispy & that was the best part. My bf ordered the prime rib Benedict or something like that & that was also incredible. I think it's safe to say that their benedicts are the stars of the menu. Maybe I'll try something different the next time I come in lol, foreal this time.   The servers we've had have at this place are always so attentive and kind. I don't remember their names but one of them said, \"my rule for ordering is that if I have to ask to remove more than two of the ingredients, it's not worth it.\" It's actually very clever since removing more than two would just change the whole dish altogether. Anyway, will definitely keep coming back!",

I usually want breakfast in the afternoon, so by 1pm or so, it's not as crazy.  Everything I've had here is delicious. My favorite item is the plain bagel with cream cheese. Simple, right? It is amazing!! It gets super crispy and is my favorite all time bagel. The french toast, eggs and bacon are also yummy.  When a place serves breakfast and lunch, I'm always torn. I go here for breakfast but sometime lunch looks so good. One time I ordered the Travis Pastrami. Oh My Gosh! Talk about delicious! I loved it! It is kinda messy, so I prefer to order it to go.    I think the prices are reasonable here. They have a monster option to upgrade the size of your food for around $3 but I think the portions are big enough. This is my go to breakfast spot in Henderson!  FYI, this is random but they sell a lot of old school candy by the register. Kinda weird for a breakfast place but if you're into hard to find candy, you would probably like it!",

Although not up to the standards of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I was pleasantly surprised considering that we were in Nevada. Very nicely done.",

Every time I order I substitute the turkey for sausage. I have been doing this for the past year consistently keep in mind. So I ordered last week the same thing and this time I go to pay and my total was different so I looked at the receipt and saw that they charged me for the full Benedict with turkey and a side of 1 piece of sausage for $4!!!!!!! So I asked the lady at the counter who is always nice what happened so she went and got another lady. I asked her why I was being charged differently from 2 weeks ago when I had got the same thing and she told me \"the person who rang you up last time did it wrong\". So someone has been ringing me up wrong for a year because that's how long i have been ordering this. I am so disappointed in this place because I love it but that's just wrong to switch it up on me with no explanation And to be a regular local loyal  customer. I refuse to go back.",

All throughout the morning and afternoon this place is packed with couples, friends, and students sipping coffee and eating healthy but delicious food.  I think this is one of my favorite breakfast places, I love the Jacob's platter, I dig any breakfast that includes a bagel & cream cheese along with hash browns and three kinds of meat. The boy enjoyed a egg Benedict over a bagel with Canadian bacon. Both awesome!",

    "text": "OVERRATED & PLENTY OF GREAT ALTERNATIVES After reading the many favorable reviews for The Original Sunrise Cafe we were looking forward to checking this place out. The comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go, one of our favorite breakfast joints in town, really had our juices flowing. The Garden of Eden omelet sounded enticing to my girlfriend and the Pretzel Sunrise Burger is one of those interesting menu items that I just can't keep from ordering.  I'm sad to report that The Original Sunrise Cafe did not live up to the expectation. We arrived just before 9 am on a Saturday and there were still a few tables open, so we didn't have to wait. The hostess was very pleasant and put us in a decent table. The menu was varied and as original as a breakfast menu can get. Our food was prepared very quickly and brought to us without delay. That's the good part.  To begin with, our waiter didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He was not rude to us, but it seemed that whatever he was doing the night before was interrupted by this work-thing that he had to get up for.   The Garden of Eden omelet was mediocre. The eggs were fully cooked but the veggies weren't drained very well and this resulted in a watery substance that oozed onto the whole plate. This made the texture of the omelet less than desirable. While my GF was happy that she had the option of fruit instead of a starch, it certainly didn't seem to be freshly prepared. It more seemed that they picked up a fruit bowl at Smiths or Vons and used that. Her bagel was fine, but it was a plain sesame bagel and there wasn't much of a choice. The bagels at The Cracked Egg are better, of a more firm texture, not the lighter bready kind.  My Sunrise Pretzel Burger was a disappointment. I LOVE soft pretzels and really love sandwiches made on them. This was more of a bread that resembled a pretzel than actually being a big soft pretzel. The worst part, however, was the burger. Not only did it seem to be a prepared burger (where the restaurant receives it cooked and they basically reheat it), but it didn't seem to be all meat/beef. It was that fine texture indicitive of filler. I ate half and took half home, but I honestly don't know if I'll eat it as leftovers (I LOVE leftovers as much as I love pretzels!)  There is no comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go and if you are willing or able to drive over to that part of the town it is well worth the effort. For a better alternative closer to this place, I'd recommend the Cracked Egg on Green Valley just north of the 215.",

No gourmet coffee but with some cream and sugar or splenda wich I prefer, it's pretty good! Maybe I'm not a coffee guru but theirs meets my 2 priorities in coffee! Dark brown and hot! Look, the place is real cool, clean, and if there's ever a problem they will make it right!! I've had alot of the items on the menu and have always been very happy with my food! The staff is crazy friendly, Theres  usually not a long wait! And like I said they do what they do very, very well, great breakfast and lunch! My boys and I love this place!",

    "text": "A friend highly recommended Sunrise Cafe. We visited for breakfast on a Saturday. The place was packed and we waited about 15 minutes for a table. My boyfriend loved his eggs, bacon, pancakes, what man wouldn't? My omelet was pretty good, nothing too special. I'm very picky about coffee so when I asked the server if their coffee was strong, he simply replied, \"Uh, we use Lavazza\". As it turns out you can screw up the brewing of Lavazza, because it was weak and awful, so sorry I bothered. We returned on another day for lunch. It was not busy at all, the service was not worth mentioning and the food was very average. Way too much $$ for a turkey sandwich. I doubt that I will go back. Ever.",

I was with a group of coworkers and we were just talking about the importance of service before we walked in. She did everything right. Seated quickly, got our drink order before leaving the table, gave suggestions, kept the drinks full, didn't bother us much, and gave the bill right as we were finishing. They didn't take AmEx which might have been the only hitch. The food was great and all of us got exactly what we ordered even with some changes we made. I had the eggs Benedict which was on bagel instead of English muffin. Never had that before but it was good. Everyone at the table liked what they had. I'll stop in here again. Nice place.",

This lovely gem is everything you're looking for in a restaurant that caters to the early risers who are looking for a great breakfast. Sunrise offers both indoor and outdoor seating and most of the time there's little to no wait, which is impressive seeing how busy this place can get from open to close. Everyone that works here from the bus boy to the owner genuinely cares that you have a great breakfast/lunch. I've actually never been here for lunch, but I wouldn't doubt it's just as good as their breakfast.   Their extensive menu offers everything from the classic eggs and bacon breakfast to breakfast wraps and omelettes. All orders also come with your choice of toast or a bagel. If you're not satisfied with anything the waiter/waitress will fix it no questions asked! The food is so good and the prices are great for the amount of food you get.   Friendly service, yummy breakfast and fair prices... What more could you ask for! If you're driving down Eastern be sure to stop by The Original Sunrise Cafe.. You won't go anywhere else for breakfast after. Promise :)",

I ordered the Ultimate French toast, which is dipped in toffee batter and also ordered the banana cream pancakes. After waiting an entire hour and 2 1/2 cups of coffee later, we finally got our meal. The looks of it made me think it was a mistake.. But our waiter confirmed those were what we ordered. Excited to try the toffee French toast was shear disappointment. It tasted like any other French toast. The banana creme pancakes were much better tasting than the French toast but still there was nothing banana cream about them. Just regular pancakes with some bananas cooked into them...not worth the 35 bucks I paid.  Because our waiter was rude, the wait was forever and the food was nothing special (sounds so tasty on the menu) I will not be returning here again :(",

Boy am I so glad I did. The customer service is top notch. Our waiter kept us laughing, our coffee and water were never left empty, and he told us about the freshly made bagels. We told him it was our first time there and we were excited. A few minutes later the manager came over to talk to us. That is so rare these days and it was very much appreciated. My friend and I each ordered a \"Create Your Own Omelette\" I got turkey, avocado and american cheese. With a sesame bagel. When our orders came out the omelette was huge!! It was fluffy and the ingredients were very fresh. I definitely couldn't finish it, even though it was so good, I wanted to. The bagel was also very yummy. I was so full I took half the bagel home. Can't forget the homemade potatoes, which reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make. Overall it was a very wonderful experience and I can't wait to bring my family.",

Wait was 5 minutes - so not bad at all there.  The waitstaff were attentive, but a little pushy towards the end because it was obvious they wanted the table.  The food was.... meh?  Certainly not the worst Eggs Benedict I've ever had, but assuredly the most bland.  The bagel vs English Muffin wasn't a thing - the bagel was actually the best part.  The Hollandaise was utterly tasteless, which kinda negates the whole point of the dish.  My husband's Pastrami omelet was very salty, and the filling was all at one end, so not a terribly satisfying omelet experience.  The \"well done\" potatoes were bland and a little greasy.  The half order of french toast was tasty - but that's the thinnest, softest Texas Toast I've ever seen.  Perfect levels of cinnamon though.  I've certainly had worse.  I guess that should be the title of this review \"We've had worse....\" which isn't much to recommend about a place.",

Service is always great - everyone is friendly and helpful and they never seem to be stressed out when the line is out the door and more importantly they do not rush you! Recently tried another breakfast joint and GVP and Sunset. It was $10 more expensive and I was terribly disappointed. If you're visiting on Saturday or Sunday morning, come early before 9am or be prepared to wait for a table. Either way, you won't be disappointed.",

The pictures drew me in.   We ordered the Crunchberry French Toast (a MUST!) to share and our own entrees. It has like a condensed milk and berry sauce drizzled one. It sounds sweet, but it's just right!   I can't remember what my brother ordered because I was too focused on my own plate but I remember him saying it was really good. I got one of the breakfast wraps called The Crispy Creamy Wrap which has eggs, cream cheese, bacon and grilled onions in a sundries tomato tortilla (other choices available) served with potatoes. It was delicious! Just thinking about it again is making my mouth water.   They have tons of selections and many items on the healthier side too. The only thing I didn't like was the bagel. It was hard as a rock but other than that everything we're tried has been amazing. The service is always great as well.",

Next time I'm in Vegas I would come back. Service was also very nice. Check out this spot if you are in the mood for a delicious unique breakfast.",

We were politely greeted when we entered and the wait for a Saturday morning went quick. The service was freindly and attentive and the food was brought out fast and with hearty portions. The food quality was delicious, as I could kind of see them making it from where I was seated, which brings me to why I did not rate 5 stars. This place can be very busy and of course seating is limited. There is a table for 2 by the secondary exit, actually practically on top of the secondary exit. As people left through that door, they were practically on top of me and getting a couple dozen flashes of brisk December morning air on my back as I was trying to eat was distracting from my meal. They should just get rid of that table rather than have uncomfortable patrons.",

Her omelet did not have sausage, mine had had two items I asked for and 3 I did not ask for.    Of course apologies were given and after a lengthy discussion with the server which I do not know why the kitchen did that, they remade the omelet with the ingredients I asked for originally.  Unfortunately it was remade next to potatoes on the grill so potatoes ended up in mine which I specifically asked for no sides, no potatoes.    There were not a lot and the pieces were big enough to just pull out and place on the side.  The disappointment is not enough attention to detail.",

Most definitely a place to return to and bring our friends.",

    "text": "Expect the orders to cost about $7-9, and I think that's a pretty good deal for getting big portions for breakfast. I thought to stop by here a couple of times since they open right after I get off of work, and they're on the way home.   They have an outdoor eating area, and this place does get fairly busy on the weekends. it is a cafe which revolves around a pet friendly, family environment. I think what I love about the place is that although they serve items that you can usually get from other cafe's, some of their items are different from other places.  I have ordered the STEAK AND EGG WRAP for $8.29 and its huge! It comes with potatos on the side so you don't feel like you've spent so much on just the wrap. You also have the option of the TYPE of wrap you'd like. You can do wheat, chipotle, or sundried tomatoe. I usually get the Sundried. If you're a meat lover and all protien. Definitely get the Steak and Egg wrap. It's deliscious and does contain big chunks of steak slices so you feel satisfied.  I've also tried the STEVIE T'S WRAP  which is also deliscious but expect it to be REALLY filling and sweet thanks to the pancake and maple syrup. It was a good wrap, but the sweetness and thickness of the wrap honestly doesn't satisfy my appetite. It just makes you feel like the wrap itself is filling up my stomach for the sake of it. BUT! Don't be discouraged. If you're into sweetness and pancakes definitely go for the wrap. It'll be worth while.  The service is great, but because they are always busy they don't conversate so much with you. They do get the job done though, and someone is always asking if you need helped or if you have been served.",

    "text": "Usually when I try a new breakfast place I try the corn beef hash as its a simple dish and hard to mess up. I started the meal asking for a cup of coffee only to have burnt coffee presented to me that not even 8 sugars could remove the awful aftertaste. That twas the first sign something was wrong. My server Tiffany tried to tell me that it was a strong coffee. Cuban coffee is strong coffee, this was weak and burnt in effigy.  When it came time to order I asked for the corn beef hash and eggs over medium with a side bagel with cream cheese. The only thing edible of that meal was the bagel and I suspect that was because the cook missed it with his flamethrower.  The corn beef was non existent and resembled the smattering of the crumbled bacon they couldn't find anything else to do with and heavily burnt potatoes, the eggs were just as bad as they were over cooked rubbery disks.   On a positive note they did offer to take it off my check or replace it with food cooked by the owner but by that point my appetite was gone and my party had finished their meal with much the same disdain. Kudos to them trying to fix the problem after the fact and the waiter not checking the table til after our meal was done.  I'm sure there are a lot of fans of this place but I am not one nor will I be coming back to it again.",

With avocado and tomatoes and egg whites it's a tasty bite. Sunrise is best for me though because they do the simple things well. Eggs and hash browns and coffee always comes out well made and fast. They have their system down pat and when I go there I always know what to expect. Convenient location right by LVAC and the beltway.",

Our waitress was so attentive and quick. When I asked how their OJ was they brought me a sample, both my husband and I ended up ordering 2 larges. Delicious! When we asked our servers favorite, she gave us tops choices in a few sections with just the right amount of insider tips. Half way through the meal I realized we got 3 of the 4 things she recommended. The Bueno Beni on a toasted Kaiser roll (super tasty eggs Benedict with a kick), ranchero wrap (with bacon added at her suggestion), and the crunch berry French toast. Everything was spot on and we basically licked each plate. Probably way more food than you typically need for 2 people, but after the long hot hike it was AMAZING! To top it off they have quirky candies that we grabbed to bring back for our kids from our trip. Overall such a pleasant surprise and I can't think of a single negative thing about the place or the fantastic service! Go, you will be happy you went!",

The coffee was great the cups were refilled rapidly by the staff.  Everyone was warm and friendly. There might be a little bit of a line: we waited about 15 minutes but the tables do turn over quickly and they do have some tables outside under the overhang in the front.

The salad toppings were nothing to rave about.  Nothing is ever want to eat again. The house dressing is a sweet honey mustard which was very generic and nothing to make it stand out for something that  was made in house.   The omelette was  ok. Cheap and diner style.

I went early and that was a good thing because the place got packed real quick. There was already a large group meeting up there, but I was able to get seated right away. One of the first few things I noticed in the restaurant were the baseball bobble heads in a case to the left when you walk in and then lots of positive quotes throughout the walls. Not everything matched and some of the baseball players were not that good, but it added character to the place. The menu was pretty big. Lots of variety in the breakfast area. I opted for the Leo, which was a salmon, egg scramble on a poppyseed Kaiser roll with cream cheese. Came with potato hash too. Big portions and prompt service. The cook even came out to check on a substitution, which was nice. A lot of the waiters seem to remember the names of regulars so I'm taking that as a good thing. The hash had a yellow seasoning in it, but I couldn't make out what it was, maybe turmeric or mustard powder? It was ok, but I could do without the seasoning. All in all, the place is well staffed, the portions are good, and the prices are reasonable. I would come back to try some other menu items in the future.",

    "text": "Yikes okay here we go. Just skip it and go somewhere else, you'd have better luck at the local ihop. I ordered a Caesar salad and the bayou burger with coleslaw. My Caesar came out over dressed and incredibly salty. The only options for the cook of meat or anything that requires skill to prepare, is well done. My coleslaw was tasteless and boring, so i asked for the potato salad which was at least a step up. The meat was bland and hard like a hockey puck, no seasoning on the beef and all i could taste was grease and onion. The pickles on the side of my burger had more flavor and depth than my entire meal. My mother ordered the eggs Benedict which surprisingly didn't come with the classic poached egg. The hollandaise was white in color and practically tasted like water, except water probably has more flavor and will leave you a little more satisfied. I'm not coming here again and i suggest you do the same. HARD PASS. And im so sorry i had to expose my palette to this shit.   **update** Manager found me outside and gave me my money back however she seemed a bit aggressive and upset that I'd left a review or even ate the food if it was \"so bad\". The point of yelp is to share experiences, and that's exactly what i did. I doubt it was an instance of \"just MY burger\" or \"just that one time\" I'm sure the burgers are always that over cooked and bland but perhaps people who are loyal to this establishment choose to overlook the food because of the staff, or maybe they are just used to flavorless food. :) I will pass on her advice to me which was to \"tell them if your food is gross and they will do their best to either prepare you something else or refund you\". Also it should be noted that I think the whole purpose of them cooking meat well done and \"basting\" eggs as opposed to poaching them, is because perhaps reaching a certain temp or poaching an egg is too technical for their staff.",

Located conveniently off the 215 and S Eastern by the LVAC, this is an original breakfast house that has been serving the south east side of Vegas for nearly 10 years!  They have an extensive breakfast menu that expands into a nice lunch menu , and they are only open until 3pm. They have the typical breakfast creations, and the not so typical creations such as crunch berry French toast, grilled muffin tops, and the Prime Rib Eggs Benedict which I tried today !  Tiffany the server was very sweet and helpful in deciding between this dish or the Peter Brady, pork chops w apple sauce. She suggested I try this one and to have the eggs basted. Will be back soon for more breakfast favorites!!",

So far, no where else has really lived up to Mr. Mama's - maybe, Bouchon, but that's a whole different vibe.   The Original Sunrise Cafe is the only spot that is competition to me. The cafe is always crowded - a really good sign for breakfast.  We waited for 5 minutes at the most before being seated at the counter.   The menu is a good size. The staff are all friendly, and anyone is willing to get you what you want/need.   I ordered the grilled muffin of the day (blueberry) and a side of potatoes. The muffin was perfectly sweet, warm, and soft, while still offering a bit of texture differences. I could eat a mountain of these. I also loved the potatoes. Rarely do places season their potatoes well, but The Original Sunrise Cafe nailed it.   I would love to come back here. The atmosphere is homey, and the food is top-notch.   Great work, The Original Sunrise Cafe.",

    "text": "I have said it before and I will say it again, it is hard to make a breakfast place stand out as creative.   Eggs, Potatoes, Bacon... it's what people eat and simply cooked you might as well just go to Denny's.       I love going to a place away from home, go to my Yelp and find somewhere that really does go the extra mile to deliver those same ingredients with an edge, a difference.  Sunrise Cafe does exactly that and they do it with style!  No, when you walk in the door you aren't blown over with fancy decor or a beautiful view.   It is in a little neighborhood strip mall at least 6 miles from the swarms of tourists on the Strip.  They blow you away with kindness!!    I focused my attention on the Eggs Benedicts and the Omelets.  You can build your own or you can chose one of their creations.  I had the King's Highway Pastrami Omelet with Pastrami, Grilled onions Swiss Cheese and spiced mustard.  I should have had the Rye bread with it as it was recommended but opted for a bagel and cream cheese instead.   They have a Buffalo Omelet as well with chicken and Buffalo sauce or a LEO which is Lox, Eggs and Onions.  Most breakfasts come with some their own version of very wonderful hash browns.     On my second visit the next day (yes--I enjoyed it that much) I had the Cajun Prime ribbed Benedict which was absolutely delicious.   Other tempting Benedicts were the Bueno Beni with sausage, onion, pepper jack and jalapeno peppers topped with salsa verde hollandaise and the Fiesta which offered jalapeno bacon.  They have other breakfasts as well and the French Toast selections look equally as amazing!!  Next time I go I think I might get the Peter Brady, a mound of potatoes topped with marinated seasoned pork chops topped with eggs, citrus chili sauce and no-sugar-added apple sauce.    Everyone on the staff was amazing and you absolutely can tell that they love working there and a big happy family.   You will feel like family too when you eat there!",

Come here for a variety of omelettes, Benedicts, French toasts, wraps, and classic platters. They also offer standard diner lunch sandwiches and such.  Came with a Yelper friend and split the Brooklyn Benedict and the Ultimate French Toast, and enjoyed both! Kitchen didn't mind splitting the dishes for us. I like how their Benedicts use bagels as the base, which makes them a little heartier. A half portion is really enough, and the hash browns were nicely crunchy. The toast had pecans and hints of toffee in the batter. I don't like sweet treats for breakfast and appreciated that the flavor wasn't overwhelming.  We went early  on a weekend and easily got a table, but I hear they get pretty packed even on weekdays. Our server, Kyle, was attentive and friendly, and our food came out quickly. I'll pop in again some other time to try lunch!",

Everything was perfectly prepared and packed full of flavor! I loved the array of hot sauces for my omelet. My husband's wrap was a delightful melody of the roasted veggies, Kalamata olives & feta cheese. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal!

    "text": "A friend recommended the Cafe as being one of the best places to have breakfast and I decided to check it out and see if he was correct.  Yes, he was!  The place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.  Regardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.  I settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?  Coffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.  I wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes.",

The food is really good. I've tried several different things on the menu and everything is really good.  This place is really crowded usually. The wait time even on a crowded day is no longer than 15 mins or so unless you are a really in a really big group. They offer you water or Coffee as you wait to be seated. I thought that was really nice.   I ordered the \"traditional\" French toast. I added two eggs and bacon. The French toast was so perfect. The butter was melted on top with just enough powdered sugar. The French toast had a light crisp on the edges. It was nice and warm. Mm.. I can't wait to go back lol.   I definitely would recommend it!!!",

The coffee was weak, watered down, and your standard bad diner coffee.   Eggs Benedicts are served on a bagel. I did Not like this at all. The bagel was cooked/toasted too much and it was so hard to cut into and chew. I think I was given a steak knife with my breakfast and I definitely needed it to saw my way through that bagel. One of my favorite parts about eggs Benedict is how the yolk just oozes into the English muffin underneath and soaks it through (#yolkporn) - this did not happen with the bagel eggs Benedict.   Anyways, nothing stood out to me. Our service was fine, nothing spectacular either. waiter was super busy with all his other tables, so he was rushed whenever he came by our table.   If you have to wait, just forget it.   I'm beginning to wonder if Las Vegas has ANY good breakfast places?! The only solid breakfasts I've had so far were at Eat and Publicus.",

It's child friendly, opens very early and closes by 3pm. They have a tv screen inside plus there is outdoor seating. Pet friendly outside. I've never brought my dog but I've seen dogs outside.

    "text": "Yes fellow Yelpers, I love yet another breakfast/lunch cafe. I can't help it! Sunrise Cafe is a bustling little cafe in a convenient location, right off the highway. And next to a Starbucks, a bonus in my book.   Huge selection so get to reading when you sit and with breakfast choices as good as the lunch choices, you'll have to deal with a battle within yourself regarding which meal to show some love. I absolutely love the Glenn Wrap, mainly because I have a severe Frank's Red Hot addiction that governs my ordering patterns just about everywhere I go. I love their hash browns too, not greasy or too seasoned, just right. For lunch I've made sweet food love to the Reuben and was not disappointed.   The staff is super friendly and you can chill at the counter seating or choose from a table or booth. You can even sit outside if the weather is to your liking. Bring Fido or Rover along, they provide dog treats and water for their canine customers. If you're hitting this place up on a weekend be prepared for a little wait. Check out the shelves as you walk in, they've got some pretty cool old school candy. Who doesn't need some Big League Chew in their life?   I could spend the rest of my life eating at places in this shopping center, for realz. Go support a local business and enjoy Sunrise Cafe.",

    "text": "I went to this place based on previous rave reviews. My experience left me a little cold. Dining alone, I was greeted by a hostess who wanted to rush me to a counter seat. Not being a fan of counter dining, I asked for a small table instead, so I was whisked to a small two-seater next to a sunny window. Not 5 seconds after sitting down, I got a fast-talking waiter who asked if I was ready to order. The diner was at half capacity customer-wise, so I was a little confused by the fast \"New York\" pace that I was experiencing. Feeling a little rushed at this point, I quickly picked the \"Jacob's Slammin' Jam\" or something like that - plenty of protein and carbs. Waiter quickly returned with coffee and water, much appreciated. Coffee tasted burned. Needed the caffeine, so I just drank it. for breakfast, potatoes loaded with grease and toast was already cold with butter re-solidifying on the bread. The meal tasted (eggs and meat) fine, but I felt rushed and the food wasn't anything to write home about.  If you're into a rushed \"New York\" vibe and don't care much about quality of food, this is a great place. Otherwise, there are plenty of better places to try. Three stars because the waiter slowed down long enough after paying the check to be polite and ask if things were ok and offered more coffee (but not water, which never got refilled).",

It has a really comfortable feel with all the positive decorations all around. There's also a few outside dining seats that are nice especially on overcast days--not so much the scorching hot Las Vegas summer days--but when they're packed, it's worth it! They are quite busy every now and then if you don't get there early enough. Last time the wait was an hour and a half, but this time it took 2 seconds since I got there before 9.",

NOT.. you walk in and they promptly seat you and take your drink order. They have booths and tables inside and do have outside tables. If you bring your dog you can seat outside and they have dog bones and will bring them water too!! One thing that caught our eye is they have the Old Fashioned bottle soda and candies. You can pick out what you want take it to your table and they will put it on your bill. My husband was in Love! I had the BLT with homemade potatoes. I had the BLT on a bagel. OMG was tasty and crunchy bacon the way I love it. The potatoes were amazing. My husband tried to steal them from me. My husband had a Pastrami sandwich with macaroni salad monster size. He was in awe with the taste. He says its hard to find a GOOD pastrami sandwich and this place is great!! The staff was very nice and attentive. They are open 7 days a week from 7am to 3pm.",

    "text": "We decided to give the original sunrise cafe a try as it was near where we were staying and the reviews were promising.  the service was great and the restaurant was cheery and colorful.  their menu was somewhat limited as it was missing the classics like biscuits and gravy and chicken fried steak.  I ordered the bagel with lox platter which was simple, yet full of flavor: a toasted bagel spread with cream cheese, a light layer of lox, topped with tomato slices, sliced red onion, and sprinkled with capers.  The lox was good quality but not in large quantity; the capers added a nice brininess, and red onion complimented the dish. The least appealing aspect was the tomatoes which were slightly mushy and not super flavorful.  The dish came with a side of skillet grilled potatoes which were good even though under-seasoned.  The others in my party had the classic breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes and their only complaint was that their eggs weren't cooked as ordered, but good nonetheless.  Overall a good experience that we would try again.",

    "text": "I can't get enough of this place. The service is awesome even when they are super busy, and the food is simply amazing. I try to frequent the original Sunrise cafe at least once a week. The food comes out really quick even when they are busy which is always awesome, and there are tons of menu options to choose from whether you like traditional breakfast or are feeling adventurous. My personal thing to order is the Crunchberry French Toast. It is absolutely delicious, and the portions are good sized. If you are looking for a Benedict they have tons of options here too, whether you want to go with a traditional benny or go for the short rib benny you really can't go wrong. The other really cool thing about this is the craft soda pop offerings. Sunrise has a huge selection of craft soda pop more than I actually have seen in most grocery stores, and there craft sodas are constantly changing so always keep checking back for more. But if you are more into your regular soda pops like sprite, coke, etc they have those too as well One of the favorite ones I've tried was the coffee cola, but they also have root beer, honey lemonade, etc. The atmosphere is a bit louder more like a diner so if you are looking for an intimate setting this is not it. Lastly, they also offer outdoor seating and is a great option on a nice day.",

We were pleasantly surprised that they were offering both a breakfast and lunch menu. We took advantage of it by each of us ordering a breakfast and a lunch entree.   I got the kicking' chicken, which was diced chicken on a hoagie roll topped with lettuce and tomatoes, completed with a tangy bbq sauce that made the sandwich all the more exquisite. It was my first time trying out their lunch menu and it impressed me enough that I would happily try another lunch entree again.   My boyfriend had his usual bueno beni which consists of a bagel, sausage patty, basted egg, fresh jalapenos, and a sauce of verde hollandaise that is out of this world!  If you're ever in the SE, this is a must try. Prices are fair and service is solid. There is a morning rush so be prepared to maybe wait 5-10 minutes especially on weekends. Place has a good casual, laid-back atmosphere.   This was our fourth visit, and it definitely won't be our last!",

We had the buffalo chicken wrap and the Fiesta Benedict. The buffalo wrap was wrapped with the chipotle tortilla wrap. It had white meat chicken with a nice flavor of blue cheese dressing. I really enjoyed it. The Fiesta Benedict was the highlight of the meal. The hollandaise sauce was light and creamy with good flavor. It had jalapeno bacon and a nice runny egg on top. The atmosphere was pleasant and we had good conversation with our friends during the holiday. I will probably come eat here again when we're in the area during breakfast or lunch time.",

No problem, the weather was beautiful and the servers brought around samples of chocolate banana nut bread, which was yummy. The wait time was about 30 minutes.    However, once were seated, that's where things went a bit downhill.  We were seated at a tiny table in a corner RIGHT by the bathroom. Really? A table shouldn't have even been there in the first place. Not only were we subjected to people walking right up against our food while they were going to and from the restroom, there were a number of flies circling throughout our meal. Since the restaurant was packed, there was nowhere else to move.  Okay.. let's just try to focus on the food and service. The service was great- very attentive, and they must have asked us if they could top off our coffee about 10 times. Toward the end of the meal, we started feeling rushed. I know they were trying to turn the table, but I hate feeling like they are ready for us to get the heck out!  The food was good, and a good value. The omelettes were nicely sized, and came with potatoes and toast for $8.99. My friend opted to get sliced bananas instead of potatoes (I know-weird), but they came with a hair attached. Yuck.    I'm not going out of my way to return, but I am not opposed to giving them another shot. Just one more, though.",

Grandma had eggs benedict and I had the  Cajon Prime Rib Beni. The garlic bread was sooo soft! The seasoning was perfect, and the food came out quickly.  The staff is friendly to everyone, and even look after another persons customer. I noticed the family atmosphere and that is how they treat each other. It is obvious that they enjoy their jobs and they treat the customers like extended family. A very rare find!

I got the crunchberry toast which was AMAZING! Enough for two people. I got it as a platter so it came with two eggs and sausage. The sausage was also delicious! I personally didn't like what my boyfriend got, which was the fiesta Benedict. He wished he would've ordered a French toast instead. Overall, we were very satisfied! We got the snow caps to go and they were SO good!",

The potatoes are possibly the best that I've ever had and a perfect addition to the omelette",

The staff was super friendly and enjoyable to interact with from the host to our waiter to everyone wishing us a good day on the way out. The food was delicious. Our waiter recommended the Cajun Prime Ribb Benedict and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. I tried the more traditional Jacob's Slammin Platter and it was very good. My eggs, lightly basted, were perfectly cooked!!! We will definitely make the 20 plus minute drive to go back for more in the near future.",

But was I pleasantly surprised! Wow! It was just as my friend described it. The food was tasty and huge portions. I had the pastrami omelet and I ordered the hash browns extra crispy and substituted the toast for bananas. The omelet was amazing. There was an explosion of my favorite flavors happening in my mouth. The grilled onions, the pastrami, and oh the Swiss cheese together was out of this world. And to boot, it's just around the corner from my home. So I will be introducing others to this place for breakfast meetings and lunch. Gotta try this place. But come early as they are always busy.",

Super simple, wholesome, crispy and tasty. The wheat bagel and lox was good, dressed with red onions, tomatoes, and a bunch of capers. The French toast was standard with fluffy eggs and crispy bacon.   Service was ok considering how busy it was. Our waitress checked on us a few times at first, but stopped once the end of her shift was approaching.   I would come back if I was in the mood for some good 'ol breakfast that's not going to break my wallet. Definitely a local gem.",

The ambiance is very hometown and welcoming, and a very relaxed place to enjoy your meal. My go-to is the eggs Benedict on a plain bagel. I have had many an eggs-Benny, but Sunrise Cafe is the best I have had to date. The potatoes are mixed with a cooked mustardy sauce of some kind, making them nearly magical. Stop by.

Several workers passed by, not saying a word. This was at least 5 minutes.  A big fan of when a customer walks in, immediately greet them.  The place was crowded at 9:30am during the week, so I thought this place has got to be good!  I ordered the veggie benedict. Didn't realize they specialized in bagels until I asked that I have an english muffin for my benedict and was told they did not have them., that they are known for their bagels. I asked for the Hollandaise on the side which they were accomodating.   My meal came, it was two sunny side eggs on top of spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and an everything bagel. The bagel was soft and chewy and loaded with butter. Didn't taste much like other everything bagels that I have had, but it was good.   I was drinking hot tea, and a server walked by with a hot pot. I asked if by any chance was that hot water, her response, No, coffee, and she continued walking.  Even the woman with me was surprised over the response and not, I'll bring you back some, I'll let your server know....   Food is ok, that most likely will return. Hopefully I will have a better experience on the service. Not asking much, just a smile and hello.",
