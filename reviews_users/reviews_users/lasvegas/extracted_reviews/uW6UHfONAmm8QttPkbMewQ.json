    "text": "I've been here a couple of times now and the food, while having huge portion size, is just okay.  If it wasn't super convenient to my house, I would not eat here.  The loco moco items are just too heavy and greasy for my taste.  There is often literally puddles of grease throughout.  The kalua pork is alright.  At least they actually drain it, unlike Ohana up the road.  The proportion of meat to cabbage is good.  The teriyaki chicken is too overcooked and rubbery.  Their desserts are yummy and have a homey taste and is really what keeps me coming back here.  Honestly those huge portions are just too big and I would rather have the option to do like a \"mini\" or half-order for half the money.  I don't want to eat this unhealthy food for three meals in a row.  Vegas is really bad about getting more money out of people by giving them huge amounts of mediocre food.  Although, I occasionally go to a wide variety of the many Hawaiian fast food places around this part of town, overall, Rice Trax is the best. And L&L at least is very consistent.  They all have dishes that are a lot better or a lot worse though, so depending on what you like, you should just try them all once and see what works for you.",

I am here in Vegas at least half the year as I also have a residence here and...dont know why I have never come to eat here before but today was the first.    Started with the Pork Won Tons as an appetizer.  I loved it - but I love deep fried stuff. Nuff' said.  I had the Furikake Chicken which was awesome.  The portions on the plates are worth your money.  I barely finished one third of my plate and took the rest back home.  The chicken is boneless and smothered with their Furikake sauce. My husband had the pork chops. 2 big chops topped with onions.     Service was great - with Aloha.  Decor is okay. Not too \"tourist\" looking but you can tell from Hawaii.    Left with a takeout menu as we will definitely do take out as well as dine in again.",

    "text": "I came here with my parents after we went to look at a house in a nearby neighborhood off of Durango. It's about 15-20 mins off the strip, so I would only come if I were in the area.  Upon arriving to the complex, it looks dark and like everything is closed. Once you open the doors to the restaurant, there's so much light and space!  When we came in, the two waitresses were busy with other customers, so they told us to sit wherever. We also had to get our own menus since we were in a hurry. I'm used to the type of service where they pamper you and can get annoying by asking you too many questions. This was the complete opposite, but the waitresses were super sweet so I can't complain! Plus since I told them that we were sharing, they brought out an extra plate. Some places you have to remind or specifically ask for a plate.  The portions are HUGE and extremely filling! We got the Teriyaki Beef (I'm not sure exactly the name) and the Chicken Katsu Moco Loco. It came out relatively quickly. Each plate came with the respective meats, two scoops of rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad.   My mom and I shared the Chicken Katsu plate, which had chicken that was deliciously crunchy and well-made and came with some sort of BBQ sauce on the side. The macaroni salad was also good; it is light and a good complement to the flavorful food. My dad's Teriyaki beef was good and reminded me of Korean BBQ. It was slightly salty and too flavorful for my liking, but if you mixed it in with the rice, it was much better.   We saw some other people get the Korean short ribs, which looked awesome so if we're in the area, we're definitely getting it!  The prices were relatively cheap! It was around $9-12 for a plate with meat, rice, and macaroni salad. I'm not sure what the poke was, but it was listed three times on the menu, each time ranging around $17-20, which deterred me from ordering it.  Summary: Good (tasty food and pretty good service) Bad (far from strip and not too visually appealing building)",

No color on the walks but they did just put some random potted plants in the corners..  Food: portion wise they give you a TON. I love loco moco's so I have this one a try. The gravy was too thick and the worst part... My meat wasn't cooked. I didn't complaint to the server since I didn't want to wait again while my partner was finished with her food already.   I don't know if I would go back for their loco moco but I've heard good things about the other plates. So maybe ill go back and try something different... But not anytime soon.",

Highlights of eating here would be the furikake chicken, kalbi short ribs, and their mac salad. I'm a fan of the traditional loco moco with hamburger meat, but the chicken katsu loco moco was worth trying. Make sure to order it with the egg cooked over-easy!   Overall, the service was friendly and the food was delicious. Would definitely come back again!",

Most times we get take out because service wise we just don't feel totally comfortable eating in -- service is hit n miss at times.  Like I reviewed before, they are not rude--just not very friendly/welcoming.  Dishes we love are the roast pork loco...super good gravy and the Teri steak or kal bi is very Ono.  Their kal bi is not those skimpy kine you get from L&L or Ohana BBQ...it is big juicy pieces.  They now offer brown rice and their toss greens is so good with homemade sesame dressing and sweet potato! Bumping up a star since last review since the food is on point.  Thank goodness this restaurant is close by and take out is available.  Tip: Friday Hawaiian plate always runs out early so call ahead....they also don't let you substitute.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Hawaiian bbq, and I must say, that while I enjoyed the flavors and tastes, I felt the execution was rather poor.  While we didn't have to wait for a table (party of 2-myself and my boyfriend), we did wait an extremely long time for a server to come take our drink orders. They seemed very understaffed for a Friday afternoon/early evening. Our server was very nice, and she even brought out a sample of their special stew for me to try, and she gave me props for even trying it, considering I'd never had Hawaiian food before. I ended up ordering a combination plate with chicken katsu and beef teriyaki.   After the waitress took our food orders, a rather large party of 10 or so people came in, and she asked us if we would mind moving to another table to accomodate the party (pushing the tables/chairs together), so we moved, and she said she would give us dessert on the house, which I thought was really nice of her.  We ended up waiting around 40 minutes for our food. I was starving at this point. They must have been short staffed in the kitchen as well. I dug in to my food the second I got it. Their macaroni salad was divine. I have never had macaroni salad that tasted that good before; it was this creamy and salty sensation that hit all the right taste buds. I wish I had more of it. Their rice was just as amazing. I felt like I could have eaten 4 scoops of it instead of 2.   The entrees weren't as good as I hoped. The chicken were cut into huge pieces, which I thought was a plus, but that katsu sauce was extremely salty and potent. I only put a dab onto each piece and it still overpowered the chicken completely. I didn't care for the sauce at all. It was so salty and meaty tasting (probably loaded with MSG) that it made me dislike the dish. I had better hope for the beef teriyaki, but that let me down as well. It was again, extremely salty, almost to the point of where I couldn't eat it. The meat wasn't cooked uniformly, some pieces were immensely rare, and others were extremely well done. The meat was also very fatty, and I didn't enjoy having to constantly cut off the fatty parts from the meaty parts.  The meal was really saved by dessert. Their mud pie was so huge! I have never seen one like that before. It was covered in whipped cream (yum), nuts, and a duo of caramel and chocolate sauces along with a drizzle of honey. It was perfection. I wanted to eat all of it, but alas, my stomach is only so big. I savored the parts with the crust the most, but this was definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Overall, the service was good, the wait times were atrocious, and the food was hit or miss; thus, deserving of 3 stars.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in the new ownership.  I certainly can't speak about what the financials were when they took over, but either things were good, or not good.  Something there made them make the changes they did.    One day I walk in and all of a sudden, my favorite dish, the Kalbi Short Ribs went from $11.99 to 16.99.  I bit the bullet at the time because one thing they were known for was their generous serving.  They usually have gave you 5 strips of the short ribs. I told myself $11.99 was a steal, $16.99 is a huge jump, but I guessed the portion was worth it.   When the dish came, they now only give you 3 strips of short ribs.  So I can't blame anyone but myself.  I just ate it, and left. L  I will say this, their service was, and still is one of the friendliest in town.  The cooks are still doing a great job as the ribs still tasted good.  This where the 2 stars come in, it's one star each to thank to them for their hard work.  I simply can't give these new owners any more of my money.  It's not the prices, I spend a hell of a lot more at other establishments, but the way they did it was not smart.  It's the principle.    My quest begins for a new Hawaiian BBQ place...if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!  Response to owner - I trust that you know the quality is even better.  Quality of beef was never an issue for me.  That's why I always went in the first place.  The quality is still great.  You asked an earlier reviewer what dish changed portion.  Well, the Kalbi Short Ribs is one of them.  Higher price, and lesser quantity.",

I would say that the workers were not on top of their stuff. They seemed to be all over the place. We had to ask for our drinks after 20 mins from when he took our order because he forgot them.   Other than the workers the food is very satisfying.",

Having said that, I can comment on flavor & overall experience.  We went in the evening & it was quite busy.  However, the wait was a short 10 minutes.  Our server was nice, but seemed a little too busy to give us the attention \"first timers\" might need.  My wife got the Kalbi Short Ribs.  Flavor was good.  However, they seemed over cooked and there was more bone than meat.  I ordered the Furikake Chicken.  I didn't enjoy the flavor of this.  As I mentioned above, the place was packed & there was also a band playing.  So, the noise level was way above comfortable.  At least for us.  We will give it another try & update as necessary.",

My brother and I had three cups each and both of us commented how good it was. I also got the Haupia ice cream pie and I was reluctant to share it! But the portion to give you is so big we would have to skip the meal in order to finish that whole piece. Everyone at the table took a bite at every single one of us loved it!

We haven't found any decent Hawaiian restaurants in LA but Island Flavor hit the spot! Didn't get here until about 1:30pm but there was still a lunch time crowd. The plates come with two scoops of rice and your choice of side - large portions! We shared 4 dishes between 5 people and had leftovers. All for under 50 bucks!   Chicken Katsu ($9): Crispy chicken katsu served with katsu sauce (blend of soy sauce, tomato paste, applesauce, onions, carrots).   Furikake Chicken ($9): Favorite! Bite sized pieces of chicken deep fried and coated in furikake sauce. Can you ask for anything more, seriously? Must try!   Kalbi Short Ribs ($11): About 4 pieces of short ribs on the plate! Marinade was on point and the short rib was nice and juicy.   Saimin ($8.75): Noodle soup dish served with scrambled egg slices, fish cake, wontons, and char sui. Interesting, but not my cup of tea.  Definitely coming back the next time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been back many times since my last review in 2013 and the food is still delicious! I've tried their Kalbi, Loco Moco, Saimin and many more and I've never been disappointed with the quality and taste of the food.   The disappointment is in their customer service. I remember dining in with a friend who knew one of the servers and the service was absolutely amazing even at busy peak hours! But other times dining by myself with other friends, the service was slow and even unfriendly. The aloha spirit should be with every customer, not just people you know. They will really go out of their way if they know you or if you're a regular there but for someone who dines every now and then, customer service is not always the best.  For example, I was looking forward to dining in today during my lunch break but our server's sassy attitude just killed it for me. Subpar service has happened in the past but today has been the worst so far. We walked in & no acknowledgement from anyone. They'd look at us but then look down or start talking to other customers instead. Not even a smile or \"I'll be right with you!\" I remember they used to do that a few years ago.  After several minutes of waiting, they sat us but no menus so I grabbed them myself. Our server took our orders with a stink face. Auntie, if you're having a bad day, excuse yourself and don't bring that attitude to customers! I said thank you when she set the food down, but didn't get a \"You're welcome.\" she literally just walked away. A customer she knew walked in few minutes later and her attitude changed--she immediately smiled & was talking in a peppy voice! My friend even said \"Oh, there you go, there's her smile!\"   Don't get me wrong, I'll probably still come back for the food but maybe delivery or take-out from now on. Like some people on here, I've noticed that the service has gone down hill over the years. It sucks cause I absolutely LOVE the food but today's visit will be memorable for the wrong reasons.",

We waited 30 minutes to be seated, we waited another 15 minutes just to be served water and get our orders, and another 40 minutes to have our food served. All the servers are in a hurry, they do t even come back and refill our drinks or give napkins. The food is really greasy, rice is way over cooked, dishes are clearly not as good as before. Maybe because the place is too busy and every are in a hurry. The quality of the food and the place is gone.

    "text": "WHY DID YOU LOWER THE PORTION SIZE AND INCREASE PRICE???????? After the new owner took over, Island Flavor lost its magic. This used to be the best place to go to for Hawaiian food. They were always so generous with their portion size which made me ALWAYS come back. To the new owner: YOURE DOING IT WRONG and you're losing so many customers. Stop changing things, nothing was wrong. I'm so disappointed because this was my favorite place to go to whenever I was craving something. Bring back the OLD island flavor!  Edit: to the owner who replied: the cost of losing customers outweighs the cost of business. Get it right",

I started off my taking one star off for the crappy service. Ok sure i was kind of greeted right away, by a surly guy asking me if i was dining in. When i said yes, just me. He asked how many.   I used my hand and held up my index finger and said just one...me... Then he proceeded to lead me to a table and dropped off the menu and asked if i wanted anything to drink. I said water for right now and he looked so annoyed that i didn't have my drink order ready to go. He didn't bother asking if i had any questions on the menu just stalked off... When he dropped off the water, i asked him if he had coffee, he said yes and since I'm diabetic, i had to make sure that it would be just black coffee, i confirmed that info with him and yup you guessed it, he looked freaking annoyed that i was confirming that it would be just black coffee. Started my meal off with a very bad taste in my mouth. If the place had been crazy busy i would almost... And yes i said almost... Understand his surliness, but when you are in the food industry it doesn't matter what kind of day that you had or are having, you paste on a fake smile and smile to you guests. Maybe I'm overly critical as i am in the industry and i have days where i felt like crap but you know what? My guests never knew that i was having a crappy day.  He did improve towards the end of the meal... He was not exactly friendly but he did touch my table a couple of times to refill my coffee and to ask if i liked my food. Service(2/5)  Now onto the food.  After reading all the reviews, i was excited to try them again ...i thought that maybe i had gotten them on a bad day last time. So totally not. I was not impressed. The chicken katsu was just average. Nothing special about it. The furikake shrimp was very crispy and had a great texture but flavor was just decent. Nothing to write home about. I had to dip it into the the sweet chili sauce to get any better flavor. The fried rice that was $2 up charge was just too salty. And if i had a better \"relationship\" with the server i might have mentioned it but since he was the king of surly...i didn't say anything. The macaroni salad was just that. Nothing special about that either. :/ Food (2.75/5)  So overall, i won't be rushing back. I might stop by to give then a third try.. maybe third times the charm who knows? Being a little generous...i rounded it up to a 3 star.   And the kicker, i did want to order cake but he didn't ask and after the attitude and surliness...it was too much effort on my part to ask for the guava cake.",

    "text": "This was my first foray into eating Hawaiian food other than just trying some of these items from a buffet.  Three of us came here to share plates and try a number of different things.  Items ordered:  1/2 portion poke furikake style Chicken katsu and kalua pig mixed plate Kalbi short ribs and shrimp mixed plate Roast pork loco moco 1 musubi  Banana bread pudding Chantilly cake Guava cake Haupia cake Kona coffee mudd pie  There were three standouts in the savory items ordered--kalua pig, kalbi short ribs, and roast pork loco moco.  I've been a fan of kalua pig and this did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were grilled perfectly with the meat being very juicy.  I thought the marinade was a little sweet and I didn't care for the flavor of the small container of sauce we got in a small container.  The loco moco was good as far as the pork was concerned and the gravy was good.  There was just so much rice that everything else got lost in the rice.  The two combination plates we got both came with two large scoops of rice and one large scoop of macaroni salad.  There was just an overwhelming amount of rice.  The macaroni salad was quite good.  I enjoy poke but this was different than other poke I've had.  The tuna was crunchy in texture and not soft like other times I've gotten poke.  I don't know which is the way it's supposed to be.  The furikake flavors were good.  I'd skip the musubi.  A whole lot of rice with only a small piece of spam inside.    For the sweet items, we got smiles from the server when we started ordering.  At one point he said, \"You do know we have large portions?\"  With a laugh, our order continued until we had four slices of cake and a banana bread pudding.  Standouts here were the banana bread pudding and the guava cake.  My favorite was the guava cake.  The Haupia was nothing special and the chantilly was a bit disappointing.  Understand that I would not turn down any of these if offered to me, but I wouldn't order those.  I found the Kona coffee mud pie disappointing.  Stick with the guava.  Now I know why my friend, Candace C, says in her review that ...\"this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-elastic-band-before-coming kind of food.\"  Service was OK.",

Have to say, thinking this is my Fav restaurant in Las Vegas, so far.  Ordered the Mixed Plate Combo which comes with your choice of 2 meats, white or brown rice and macaroni salad.  I had the Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs.  Furikake chicken are boneless chicken pieces deep fried and tossed in there special Furikake sauce. The Furikake chicken was out of this world!  No words can describe this soooo delicious, scrumptious culinary Flavor!  Island Flavors knocked it out of the ball park with this chicken!  Also, had the Kalbi Short ribs which was so delicious, 2 big scoops of brown rice and Mac salad.  Portion sizes are  very generous here...they definitely don't skimp on portions.   Prices are very reasonable, especially for the generous portions you get.  As you walk into the restaurant you're greeted by the Waitresses who are very friendly with lotsa aloha attentive love and beautiful smiles.  The Restaurant decor is Hawaiian and clean.  Can't wait to come back...Keep thinking about the Furikake Chicken...they're as addicting as the Senorita Bread in Sacramento...Best Hawaiian food if you can't be on the island. Island Flavors represents!!!",

I recently went on a low carb diet so my selections were limited. I went with the Kalua Pork & cabbage with a tossed salad. Very savory and I could have easily hurt myself eating if there was 2 to 3 times as much in my bowl. Pork was super tender as was the cabbage. Will be trying the Oxtail soup next time. And there will be a next time. Oh! BTW: The Kona coffee was nice and strong.   This is a small setting in a strip mall and if you're not the laid back & patient type you may be put off when the servers get busy. It's a regular folks kind of place so don't expect strip resorts level of service. But you will see an honest effort. Respect begets respect.",

Island Flavor gets excellent reviews and they are definitely warranted. I'm only here for a couple more hours, but I wish I can sample all their delicious authentic dishes and juices. Come in and have a seat, then you'll see that you made the right choice just by looking at all the happy and eager-to-eat local groups of friends, family, and the occasional non-Hawaiian customer like myself.

We moved out of area and haven't been there in over a year so for my brothers birthday we decided to come back there because the food was really good. We were so disappointed when we left.... The cooks weren't the same, the servers weren't the same and the food wasn't the same. Rice was like paste, teriyaki steak was salty, and the Katsu wasn't breaded like before. I noticed other people's plates around us left their rice on their plates as well so I knew we weren't the only ones.   The only positive thing that night was the server giving my brother a free desert for his birthday.",

It's not just the friendly/attentive staff, nor the delicious, never bland flavor of all their dishes, or the generosity in which they choose to portion their food, or the overall amazing atmosphere in this blessed eatery. It's the culmination and perfect balance of all those things.  Their spam musubi is to die for. Add a bit of Sriracha and you've got yourself a whole meal. All their entree items are a dream come True for a foodie like me. Beef teriyaki isn't the skin thick kind you get from L&L (smh), but rather steak like cuts of the cow. Katsu is perfectly fried and dont even let me get started on the Loco Moco.   If you haven't, check this place out, if you have, then what the hell are you reading this for? Better be on your way to island flava!  Edit: Been 2014 since I last reviewed it. Just wanted to reassure everyone that they have kept True to their winning formula. Expect a great meal.",

Getting the food to go so once consumed I'll let you all know how the food was.Well, I ate the whole thing lol and it was really tasty.  Short ribs have a tendency to have more fat than meat but this place gives plenty of meat, nice flavor, tender...perfect. The Kona Pie was really good but the crust was a little too sweet for my taste. Chicken teriyaki was pretty good also. This place is the real deal so if you want more of the authentic Hawaiian food flavor come and give this place a try. Have a wonderful day and happy yelping  your fellow yelpie xoxox",

As for the decor, it could be a bit nicer but it makes it more comfortable then a big fancy restaurant.      Also the service, you don't really have a server when someone walks past they check on you and who ever is available takes your order. Sometimes it's better then others but normally service is amazing.      I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Hawaiian food.",

The furrikake chicken is AMAZING, but as my friend says \"stairway to heaven\", it'll probably give you a heart attack if you eat it too much.  The teriyaki chicken might be a little plain/bland for my taste buds BUT! try it in the teriyaki chicken salad and the flavor really comes out! Somehow the rice really zaps the flavor away on the teriyaki chicken.  The coffee mud pie dessert is awesome. Yummy! A huge ice cream pie slice that's enough to feed 4 people (that's if all of you already have leftovers from the entrees haha)",

I ordered the Hamburg steak and the Furikake chicken, and expected the same thing. The Hamburg steak was similar but less juicy, I was glad that the Gravy still tasted the same, but was charged $1 for a small cup of additional gravy where as Aunty M provides with no questions.  The Hamburg steak and gravy serving was also a bit smaller.  The service provided reminds me of how a Japanese restaurant nickle and dimes you and not the family style hospitality that a Hawaiian restaurant normally provides.   Next the Furikake chicken, was an utter disappointment.  The chicken used is the standard Chinese/Teriyaki joint chicken that is utilized and overly saucy.  The sauce tasted the same, but the quality of preparation just wasn't there.  The portion of the chicken that I expected to be provided was also half.    I visit my friends here in LV probably once a quarter, and probably won't find myself coming back.",

We were here during a pretty nasty monsoon storm and for whatever reason the tiles on the ceiling began to fall (randomly). There were bits and pieces that would fall and we were scared that it would fall into our food.   They were so nice to re-make our food and had it to-go.  Island flavor not only gets 5 stars for their delicious food items; they also get 5+++ for quality, friendly service to their customers. I'll be back to probably try almost every single item on your menu. Challenge accepted right?  :)",

We also ordered korean fried chicken and that was a bit salty. Well, they need to step up there game cause Zippys will soon be here. They will see a change. Just a word of advice!

Located in the SW area of Las Vegas on Durango.  One tip if you are going for dinner be sure to get there early. The seating is very limited inside and gets packed real quick especially with the large ohanas coming to eat, we tend to take up a few tables. Lol! The menu is exactly like back home, traditional white rice and mac salad with every entree plate. Us Hawaiians Love our rice! Got some local classics to choose from...Saimin, Chicken Katsu, Oxtail Soup, Hamburger Steak and cannot forget Hawaiian plate!!!! Every Aloha Friday stop by to get your hawaiian plate fix. Laulau, lomi salmon, haupia....mmmmmm so ono! The laulau is by far the best ive had since moving here. Plenty meat and real good size for what you pay. No manini action over here ( manini=small, tiny)  If you ever wanting that local taste or missing home stop by here. All the workers are from Hawaii and full of the Aloha spirit thats what keeps us coming back. Prices are reasonable, big portions and Ono, Ono, Ono! They have a marketplace next door if you wanna snag some goodies to take home. Poi!!! Pocho Sausage!!! Hawaiian Sun!!! Cuttlefish!!! Soda cracker!!!!",

It took an hour and a half to bring out one plate out of three AND the food tasted like charcoal and I'm positive rat turds taste better than what was being served at this joke of a place. I would give negative five stars if it were possible. This piece of garbage is future dirty dining worthy. This place USED to be excellent but clearly the quality has sorely declined. No hostess greets you; just an overwhelmed girl behind the Take Out register ignoring you and a sad clipboard to write your name down. One server and no hostess and another one or two clueless bussers for the entire restaurant is just ridiculous...but I guess cutting business costs is more important to the owners than having an adequate number of employees and making sure customers are happy and want to actually return.",

They were very salty and super greasy! There is a difference between juicy chicken and oily chicken and this was just oily. I bit into it and the oil ran down my chin and fingers. It was pretty bad. We also ordered poke which was warm and that was an instant turn off because sashimi is usually cold. I wasn't a fan of that. The fried rice was bland and also salty. I basically left there feeling like a slug that just got salted. Not to mention I ordered a coffee and had to check on it about 3 times and they told me it was brewing and still never got it. I then had to ask them to take it off the bill. I didn't like the food or the staff attentiveness. I definitely will not try this place again.",

She said she was bringing boxes and we waited around for 15 min and she still didn't come. We will not be returning.   Dear owner,         Your servers have been working their for a while. They weren't new. Looks to me like you're way understaffed. Maybe instead you should've came in and helped out and not sit on the computer lying about a \"new server\"",

Go when it's slow and all is gravy, but today (Sunday) they only had 2 servers on for the whole floor and one poor guy manning the phones, doing Togo's, running food, etc.... Seriously. What kind of business owner staffs their FOH so thin? Is it really worth losing future business so you can save eight bucks an hour? My to go order took an hour and everyone else who was waiting was in the same boat. The place was packed, food looked and tasted good (although my order was incorrect) so there's that. Staff your business!  Dear Business Manager. I cannot believe you actually said you staff appropriate. As if one extra body on the floor would have corrected your service and to go issues. You should be embarrassed and overly apologetic for how your restaurant failed the hard working kitchen instead of insisting you're staffing appropriately. This isn't the first time there's been Togo/delivery issues. You had many, many people absolutely frustrated waiting for online orders alongside guests on a wait.  The two ladies who were serving were running around like crazy, bussing their own tables, running food, boxing orders and everything else that servers do. On a slammed busy Sunday you don't have server assistants? No host/hostess? Just one overwhelmed guy on the phone? Where were you?!   I'm sorry you don't seem willing to grasp this concept.

The restaurant was packed, but we were able to find a seat (party of 2).    Once we were sat, our server gave us menus and took our drink orders.  We couldnt decide what we wanted to eat because we were craving everything.  We started kff with poke, Hawaiian style.  It had inamona (kukui nut), onions, ogo, and soy sauce.  It was so good!!!! The best poke ive eaten in Vegas so far.  We both decided to get the mixed plate ($11.50) but you add $1 if you choose a mixed plate with Kalbi.  It comes with 2 choices of meat, 2 scoops rice, & 1 scoop mac salad.  The portions were humongous!  We decided to get the katsu/kalbi, & korean chicken/furikake chicken.  We enjoyed it.  For dessert, we shared a guava chiffon cake.  I believe it came with a guava coulis and a lilikoi coulis.  It is a F A T slice of cake with a lot of whipped cream.  It was also good.   I suggest this place if you want poke because the poke was really good.",

    "text": "I havent gone back here in yearsss until today. First thing i noticed was the restaurant got bigger and from what i was told from the waitress its a new management. The vibe for some reason was just a little different from the last time i visited years ago, they were playing country white music which didnt felt like i was in a hawaiin restaurant lol but it didnt matter. My friend and i ordered the hawaiin poke which was good and the chicken katsu, though the mac salad didnt taste so good, im not sure if they changed the way they cooked it. Our waitress was super friendly and was on top of her game refilling our drinks and making sure we were doing ok. Overall i like it but i miss the old vibe when island flavor first open. :)",

This place is incredibly awesome! The service is enthusiastic and friendly and literally everything we've eaten has been amazing, plentiful, affordable, flavorful, and worth coming back for!   Cucumber Kimchee! Zowie! A veritable taste explosion! Hawaiian Poke! Super fresh, perfectly salty, and delicious! Kalbi Short Ribs! Sweet, savory, moist, and memorable! Guava Cake for Dessert! Light and huge, and something we've never had before or since!  I could list every item on their menu but what's the fun in that?! Instead, you should just go there and try it yourself! We'll be back!",

    "text": "We've lived across the street in Rhodes Ranch for 14 years. We were there the day Island Flavor opened their doors.  We've seen all the changes in ownership, cosmetic and quality of food. For many years we frequented Island Flavor weekly and many times we'd bring huge parties after a basketball games, football games and family events.  Our visits have drastically slowed down because we have seen a consistent decline in food quality.   Last night we brought a party of 25 for a family event.  Several of us orders poke.  I took one bite and literally spit it out and so did my husband, 2 cousins and 2 friends.  I would chalk it up to a bad batch but it wasn't the first, second or third time.  It's been consistent since the new management.  It was mushy, was not fresh and had a smell that turned my stomach.  The other thing I've noticed a huge change in is the saimen; it's half the size of the previous portion.  My family (my husband and 6 kids) have opinions of how their favorite plates have change is portion and taste. To be fair, there are many items that still tastes the same.   Additionally, it was really stuffy and warm in the dining area which made it uncomfortable to enjoy my food.  Lastly, I love the fried avocado dish, good job!  Most importantly the service still has that aloha love! KEHAU is amazing!  She did a wonderful job handling our big party!  She was so attentive and expeditious with all of our orders! Love her!   Over the years, we have spent thousands upon thousand of dollars at Island Flavor, I'm hopeful that you take my food quality concerns and address them.   The extended dining room was s great decision and Friday night kanikapila is a wonderful touch.   Make some changes on several dishes and I think you'll be fine...  Aloha, Lei",

    "text": "I have been a regular customer here for over 3 years and it use to be our weekly date night spot but in the last year we have gone less and less due to quality of food and service.  Yesterday we went and it was busy when we arrived, there appeared to be only 2 people working so it took about 15 min to be seated which we understood because she was busy trying to process tickets for people.  There were no clean tables, so we had to wait for her to clean one off.  Once seated we waited another 15 min for her to come and take drink orders and another 15-20 to bring them back.  We ordered 3 orders of Loco Moco, an order of Korean chicken wings and a shrimp furikake plate.  40 min later we got 2 of the locos which were cold and the hamburger was dry and so salty it was hard to eat.  The eggs ordered over easy were over hard. 20 min later the other loco came out and we were told the shrimp and chicken were on their way. We had all finished eating and the other 2 orders still weren't out.  She finally stopped to check on us and we asked and she said oh it will be just a minute.  Another 10 min and she brought out the Korean chicken thighs (we ordered wings) and said they made them in error but would get us the wings.  Finally the shrimp showed up.  My daughter ate them and still no chicken.  Our drinks had been empty for a while by now as well.  We got up and got a box that was sitting on the counter for the loco moco we had left and finally had to get up to ask her for the chicken to go because it was now close to 2 hours we had been there and had places to go.  There were 2 tables that got up and left because they hadn't been waited on and the people next to us were complaining about service and the food quality.  We stopped going because of these issues but decided to give a final try but it was definitely the final for us and we won't be back.  Sorry to see such a great place go downhill.  I miss the nice juicy hamburger in the loco,  I am not a fan of the pork belly/hamburger mixture now.  Since the new owners took over 2 years ago and expanded, the food quality has slowly gone down and the friendly island atmosphere is gone.  We love the desserts but were afraid to order anything more because we didn't want to be stuck for another hour waiting.",

Also tried the Portuguese bean soup, Korean chicken wings, and the Loco Moco. Portuguese bean soup is basically minestrone soup with tiny pieces of sausage. The Korean chicken wings had a dull flavor. Usually Korean chicken wings carry a robust kick of ginger and garlic. Not so with this version. The Loco Moco was so good! Giant portion that could easily be turned into two meals. Friendly service in a great atmosphere.",

Like Whoa! Did I enjoy every bite, food coma if eaten at one seating but worth it, OH YEAH! Don't know what eveyone else ordered because I was focused on my food but I know everything was a hit since everyone ate what they had ordered, leaving no leftovers for me to pick on the next following work day.  Dont know about the in-dining experience yet but the ordering was easy, pickup was fast and the food was a hit. Can't wait for another Island flavor food experience.",

Im from San Jose and we have alot of L&L type Hawaiian bbq places that generally has the same menu,  but different flavors,  so when I was going through Island Flavors menu I was really excited. The portions of food are big and share friendly. We sat down to eat and the customer service was top notch. The atmosphere is really laid back with island reggae music in the background. You know that the food is good when you devour everything on the plates and don't even talk to the people you came with at the table. We had the furikake chicken, the kalbi short ribs, fried rice, and spam musubi. It was all so flavorful and would definitely recommend those items if its also your first time here and you are debating on what to get. The only thing about the spam musubi, in my opinion, is that its made with too much rice and not much sauce, but despite that, this place is amazing. Next time I come to Vegas I'll be sure to tackle some more items on the menu.",

    "text": "Yelp 365 Challenge #150/365 (Operation Rice / Las Vegas Adventures)  FOR THE WIN!!!  In my previous review, I shared that we had an all day that was busy at the Adventuredome then watching the Fountains at the Bellagio. By the time that we reached our vacation rental it was past 8:00 and I asked everyone what did they want to eat for dinner?  Everyone replied, \"Anything with rice\"  So, of course, I opened up my trusty Yelp app and typed in local food.  Well, waddaya know...there was a local food restaurant, \"Island Flavor\" RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.  If I wanted to weep with joy because I didn't have to drive very far!  I wanted to weep further because their menu made our stomachs growl happily.  I called up the restaurant to place a takeout order. I shared with her that all the plates were all rice instead of salad. She was really friendly and then asked if we ate brown rice too? I though they ran out of white rice and it didn't bother us to where I shared her that we did. But, she said, \"No, I'm going to give you that in a container on the side too.\"   After placing the order, she shared that they close at 10 and if I got there before then and the door was locked, I could just knock on the window and they'll open up for me.   If you live near Durango, this place is very easy to find.   Sure enough the door was locked but they let us in. After we paid for our food and was loading it up in the car, she came out and told us to wait because they were also including haupia with our plates. YES!!! I didn't win no jackpot but we got some good eats from Island Flavor!!!  When we brought the food in the kitchen, everyone just wanted to swoon not only because there was rice but the portions were HUGE.  Loco Moco: The hamburger and eggs practically filled the entire plate oozing with gravy.  Kalua Pig and Cabbage: This plate was HEAVY because it was loaded with kalua pig and cabbage.  Kalbi Short Ribs: Oh my heavens...if you were ordering this plate in Hawaii, you would have three regular size pieces that were cut on the thin side. But, Island Flavor didn't give me three...they gave me FIVE THICK PIECES.  Along with these plates, they included shoyu and whatever brings warm fuzzies to a local person who loves local island food.   Breakdown of Island Flavor:  Food: The menu is extensive. Poke maybe on the pricey side BUT since this is the desert, you have to expect it. Overall, the menu caters to everyone who is visiting or moved to Vegas from the 808 state. I thought it would be like L&L or Loco Moco but nope, their flavors are more of the homecooked style that makes you miss your family back at home in Hawaii.  Customer Service: FILLED WITH ALOHA  Prices: Reasonable especially because the portions are HUGE  Location: Easy to find  Restaurant / Ambiance: Just right, clean and family friendly  Recommendation: FIVE STARS...it is a must go-to for anyone who never tried but wants to try local food from Hawaii, 808 visitors or 808 people who moved to Vegas and just misses the food from the islands.",

    "text": "To start off we've been here many times before and haven't had a bad experience but this one left a lot to be desired. Our server was good and the place was pretty packed when we left but when we first arrived I waited about 5 minutes so that a table could be bussed so we could sit at it when there were a couple others open and set. This ended up being horrible as everytime someone opened the door I was crippled by the blinding sunlight and as I said it was busy so I was blinded a lot.  The Furikake chicken was amazing as always and we always get it but the poki however was very inconsistent and some pieces were down right bad. For a pound of poki we are about 1/4 of it and I decided it's better to waste it then to get sick. Overall a disappointing experience that could've been fixed with a little more quality control and attentiveness from the staff.  2 stars because I know they could do better.",

I'm actually pretty annoyed that furikake chicken is under their \"review highlights\" because that must mean it's a popular dish, which is weird to me. I LOVE furikake. Seriously, if you put furikake on anything, I'm bound to love it. I was really disappointed with this chicken though... Again, I tried the same dish twice.   Both times I tried the chicken, it was overcooked and dry. This is why I don't understand how it's such a popular dish. You must all have pretty low standards for food, I guess.   I'm from Hawaii and I love finding all of the Hawaiian places around town to try, but this place did NOT satisfy. Maybe I should try some of their other menu items??? A little scared though because any restaurant that can't cook chicken properly is automatically sus to me. This dish just isn't right and they need to re-evaluate the execution of it. I was expecting something more similar to the Garlic Chicken at 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate. Now THAT is some ono chicken...",

I stood there for 5 minutes while people whisked past me without so much as a smile. I left.  Second time I was more patient, I waited the same 5 minutes being ignored, then got sat at a \"dirty table.\"  I guess it wasn't filthy but the tabletop certainly wasn't wiped very well (sticky). I waited 10 minutes before any server came to say hi, she wasn't very pleasant. I asked if it was a long wait for food ilke BBQ mix and she said it depends. She was called away and didn't return for another 5 minutes so I left.  Third time I decided I just HAD to at least try their dang food but I won't go inside. I ordered Ahi Poke and Loco Moco to go. Poke was pretty good, gigantic chunks and a lot of it, better be for $20. The Loco Moco was horrid. Plain, bland, no flavor at all, hardly any gravy, it was just plain bad.  I won't be attempting a 4th visit here. I'll just go to O'hana BBQ down the road.",

I've been to Hawai'i but don't remember the cuisine so I had to go on her word lol, whoops!  We Ordered: 1. Poke (Shoyu) 2. Saimin Soup 3. Loco Moco 4. Kona Coffee Mud Pie  Poke is very flavorful and it being an appetizer, we were expecting it to be very small, which it was not. It was enough for me and the guy I married to share.  Saimin Soup, man, there was a lot of flavor that I was not expecting! First off it was a large bowl, and there was so much in the soup by my standards. Wontons, the pink & white fish patty thingies (I don't like 'em but they're always in Saimin), and the noodles. The broth was so tasty! I was expecting it to be bland, considering the broth was very clear, but it was so flavorful, yummy!!!   Loco Moco, gees, this thing is huge and yummy! Enough said.  Kona Coffee Mud Pie, OMG... I love coffee ice cream and this is so MUCH better! Topped with whipped cream, macadamia nuts.   The service is also a thumbs up! They're all so welcoming, very attentive and always really sweet when we come in.   Yes, I'd recommend this place to friends and fam. Yes, we would go back, and have repeatedly.",

I had the portuguese bean soup (very generous with their ham and portuguese sausage), kalbi (onolicious) and furikake shrimp(I'm not a fried food fan but this was pretty good). I'm not a fan of mac salad either but this place makes a good one.  Then I ordered the chantilly cake to go. It's pretty close to the Liliha bakery one which btw is my favorite cake of all time.

I came here for lunch yesterday with My T. and Thao T. and I have to say it was pretty dang awesome.  I haven't had lunch yet, so I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Aright, I'm going to give you the low down.  The portions are big here, so I would suggest you go with a couple people, and you guys all try each others' stuff.  These are the 3 things we got, and I'll probably get them again.    1.  Korean Chicken - I have had wings like this once before in my life, and it was called Dry Fried Chicken at a restaurant in San Francisco called San Tung, and they are legit.  I wouldn't make a meal out of this, that's why I'm saying share.  Juiciest wings ever, and that Korean sauce is wicked  2.  Kalbi Short Ribs- Again, it's a lot of food, so most people would die if they had this whole plate.  They are so tender, you can pull them off the bone.  I want it now.  3.  Baby Back Ribs (can't find on menu for some reason, maybe new item) - My least favorite, but fantastic in the least.  It just doesn't compare to the top 2 items I mentioned.    Owner served us, he's a great guy.  So humble, very chill vibe in the place.  You can tell it's really Hawaiian.  I will come back.",

Everything is here is huge, so prepare to share or come very hungry :)  If I am on a diet, this is a very dangerous place to be since I would push myself to eat them all, because foods are all that good.  Service is friendly and excellent, it's not just foods but their hospitality reminds me of our vacations in Hawaii, too.",

    "text": "Two year's ago when my Family and I first ate here it was decent, nothing crazy amazing, but decent for local food with big portions and good mac salad. We didn't frequent here much after two years cause its a ways from where we live and like I said, the food is okay, not worth the drive for us. Last weekend my cousin ate here and said their poke was ono and we should give this place another try; so we did!   The service was awful from the minute we walked in, granted it was a Fri nite, we didnt know they played hawaiian music on the weekends so they where busy. The cashier/fill in server (heavy set girl) was rude as hell! Chomping a mile a minute on her gum, no smile, no greeting and says \"you guys got reservations?\" I said \"No\", She then tells us \"I gotta check if we can serve you guys den\", and walks off. Wow!!! Local kine style would be...No worries, we goin make room for you guys, not to mention the fact that I don't know of any restaurant that would turn customers away! We immediately felt unwelcomed/uncomfortable from the get. I'm local, born and raised in Hawaii, so the lack of Aloha ecspecially from a Hawaiian place put me off even more!  She comes back tells us kay can, as she's seating us I tell her \"sorry, I didn't know we needed to make a reservation\", she tells us \"no you no need, but mandatory that you do\"... Huh?!?. As Im looking around, there is 3-4 tables with reserved signs. The table we got sat at, the one next to us(customers sat about the same time we did) and other tables with people already sitting had no reserved signs. Not to mention the fact that no customers came in after us for any reservations, just a couple people coming in to pick up their takeout order, so I don't get why she needed to ask if we could be served in the first place. The vibe I got was like, who you? You not our regulars, hurry up eat & get out!   She seats us, right off the bat not letting us even look at the menu ask, \"what we wanted to drink\". I remember two years ago they had p.o.g . Was not even sure if they still had it? Wanted to at least ask my kids and Husband to see what they wanted to drink, we didnt even get the chance! Her attitude was hurry the f* up!, we ended up just getting waters after being rudely rushed. She brings us our waters and is ready to take our order, I was unsure of what I wanted so I asked if we could get a minute more. She looked irritated and walks off. She comes back 10 min later, giving me dirty looks. I'm trying to order and she's cutting me off while I'm talking, \"you cant order it like dat, what you said? On da side?\" Her attitude was just plain rude, again, like hurry the f* up!   We get our food and it was not good. The lau lau plate was a chunk of dry, tasteless pork wrapped in one thin layer of luau leaves(luke warm in the middle and shaped like a rectangle loaf, looked nothing like lau lau) bummer it had no butterfish either. Worse part, as I'm eating my rice I find a short black hair in the middle...ewww! my Husbands terri beef meat was chewy and burnt, my daughter said her korean wings where dry and bland. The poke was ono and the mac salad was still as good tho.   We already felt uncomfortable and just wanted to leave. Since we paid $50 for our food, we didnt want to just throw it out and thought we could give the leftovers to our dogs. We asked for boxes and got no bag for our 5 boxes, before we could even ask for a bag from a server (not the rude one) they ran off! You would think to give a bag if the customer got that many boxes no?   Needless to say, we will not be returning here again. Rude unwelcoming service and subpar local food!",

Sample the side \"Mac Salad\".. s/b Cool, Not too salty or watery ...A must visit before your food bill doubles a few miles away,,,,",

The oxtail soup is also really good. The chantilly cake is sinfully amazing. If that stuff wasn't so fattening, I would probably eat a whole cake to myself.

My boyfriend ordered the furikake chicken and the chop steak. The furikake chicken is BEYOND delicious! The steak was juicy and amazing.  Next time I won't order the Katsu but everything else I will order again! I highly suggest the two meat plate, get the furikake chicken and the teriyaki steak and you will be soooo happy you did!!

I ordered their special of the day which was: Kalua Pig and cabbage, ahi poke, rice, macaroni,  salsa, and some kind of coconut dessert and man was it delicious. The Kalua pig was cook perfectly, soft and not salty at all. The ahi poke was fresh and very well marinated, the macaroni was good  love the big black pepers in there, and their dessert was the icing on the cake for me. I wasn't the fan of the salsa but that's just b/c I'm not an onion peron.   I also shared the oxtail soup with my boyfriend and it was good, too much ginger flavor for me though but other than that I would totally come back here to eat if I'm ever in Vegas again.",

A plus is that this is a family owned business so you see the same friendly faces when you go in.   My personal favorite the loco moco. The beef patty reminds me of a well seasoned and cooked meatloaf. My second favorite is the teryaki chicken the marinade isn't salty and its actually cooked on a grill. I hate those Hawaiian \"barbecue\" place that cook their meat on flat tops. The flavor profile of meat cooked on the grill is irreplaceable. The desserts here are delicious and huge so order one for the table and share away.   Highly recommend  this place. The only downside is that they are closed Sunday and Monday but I guess they need days off too :)",

Don't waste your money on the guava cake, when u can have the kona mud pie. The guava didn't taste fresh. Must try their combo plate roast pork and kalbee! Oh and also their furikake chicken, Ono! Fried rice was a no go as it's too dry and best when using non sticky rice. Chicken katsu loco moco almost gave me a heart attack as it was so huge! Friendly staff and lots of memories of the islands.",

The mixed plate had three huge pieces of Kalbi, 10 pieces of Katsu, macaroni salad, and I paid extra to get their pork fried rice.  I took home a little more than half my food and it barely fit into the to go box! The servers were friendly.  But the reason I didn't give them four stars was because the service was SLOW!  We waited over 30 minutes for our food.  Granted they were busy but... All things considered, I'll definitely be making the drive to try more of their food. If you are in the SW definitely visit Island Flavor!",

Being that it was friday they had a special \"Hawaiian Plate\" which has :  - Two large scoops of rice - Macaroni Salad - Lau Lau ( Only after 3pm )  or Kalua Pork  - Ahi Poke in Shoyu - Haupia - Lomi-lomi salmon  My coworker recommended it as a way to be aquainted with the tastes of hawaii.   Let me tell you the food was AMAZING.  The pork was tender , flavorful and definitly a repeat. I quite enjoyed the ahi poke , mac salad.  Im not a huge fan of salmon , so i ate very little of the lomi-lomi salmon.    I detest coconut , but the Haupia was amazing as an end to a terrific meal.   The wait staff was attentive and for the price i was stuffed.     I will definitely be bringing my wife here to try it out.",

Last time I went here, I was craving a loco moco because a couple days ago I tried one from the Fukuburger truck & couldn't stop thinking about it so I figured I'd try Island Flavors.   When I got it, it was really big like twice the size of Fukuburgers, but to be honest it was good but not as good as Fukuburgers. It didn't have that special ingredient or something. What can I say, I'm spoiled by fabulous flavors so maybe I'm just being picky.    All in all, I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food is good, they serve big portions, there's a nice welcoming feeling as you walk in, they're friendly, the place is clean & fast service even with it being busy.",

This place has been around for over a year or so now, opened by a Big Island guy!  So, you'd better expect BIG!  Expect to bring home some leftovers for dinner/lunch/breakfast the next day!  Every time we come here, we feel like we're back at home again!  For some reason, food (and music) will always take us back to the islands...  *smack!* the Chicken Katsu Loco Moco!  First time ever trying both local favorites - together!  MmmMmmm!  Aaaand, leftovers to take home!  OHH!  And you should try their Fried Rice and Omelet!  I think it's on their Specials Menu!  That fried rice is soooo tasty, with huge pieces of sausage in it, and so very moist and perfect!  They serve it with 3 slices of Portuguese sausage, I think it's the Maui or Big Island kine!  HUGE!  And ONO, too!  Other goodies to try, Korean Chicken (saucy!), and their Kalbi!  If you are from Hawaii, and you live here in Las Vegas now, forget about L&L for your local fix!  Summerlin finally has a place that serves up one of the best local foods I've tasted since living here!  Broke da Mouth!",

    "text": "I love this place. Everyone from the server to the cooks in the back are very friendly. When we got there I ordered the terriyaki chicken plate (to compare it to the other terriyaki chicken plates) oxtail soup, chicken katsu, and I believe some type of pork. I can't really remember much about the pork because of all the other food I ordered but let's just say from the several bites I had it melted in your mouth.  Let's start with the terriyaki chicken. I have to say that this is the best terriyaki chicken at a Hawaiian restaurant. L&L's is too fatty and chewy, Aloha Kitchen always requires you to remember to ask for it with no skin, and there are a couple other places that weren't so memorable. It sounds strange to say but the chicken tasted like ... chicken. Real meat, not covered up in fat and that chewy gristle, just meat, that might not make any sense but if you've had that chewy gristle you know what I'm talking about.  The same goes for the chicken katsu. The chicken was solid meat and the breading was crispy and clean, not soggy and greasy like some other places. Same goes for the oxtail soup, while the oxtail was extremely fatty (I never knew ox carried so much fat in their tail) the actual soup was not greasy but crisp and gingery. It tasted a little bland at first but once you start eating the oxtail and bites from a couple other dishes the soup actually complements the flavors.  If I'm craving some Hawaiian food, this would definitely be among my top choices. However it loses a star because believe it or not I'm a fan of the canned mystery meat known as spam. They don't have any spam dishes and their spam musubi is pre-made and sits out on the counter which means first come, first serve and if you get there at night then you're SOL. But even if you were to get it, you have to eat spam musubi that's been sitting on the counter for awhile, for some reason it's not made to order, kinda weird but all in all a good spot.",

We ate all of the poke and had a misubi and our plate of food still did not come.  The waitress gave us the bill, that's when we realized that our waitress didn't get our order right and thought we only ordered the poke. So after waiting another 10 minutes, our plate of food arrived.  It was big, just like other yelpers said.  There was enough food for both my wife and I to share one plate for lunch.  There were three pieces of kalbi ribs and a decent pile of roast pork with gravy, two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. But one piece of the kalbi ribs was all fat, with very little beef on it.  I was not too impressed with this plate, as the whole plate was lacking in flavour.  The kalbi ribs could have been marinated longer, the roast pork was not that tasty and there wasn't enough gravy for the two scoops of rice.  The macaroni salad is standard fare just like any other Hawaiian cuisine restaurant.  The misubi wasn't fresh, rice was on the hard side.  I do like the big portions of the mixed plate though and their poke was fresh and quite tasty, so I will come back and try some of there other menu items.",

We saw the reviews and turned around and went in! We were met at the register by a friendly guy who took our order. My husband had the special, a chicken dish with the fried rice upgrade and I had katsu chicken also with the fried rice upgrade. It was incredible. Enough food for 2 with one order...we took almost an entire two meals home with us. The fried rice was AMAZING...the katsu chicken cooked perfectly and my husband's chicken special was so tender it fell off the bones! So here it is Sunday afternoon and my husband says...I want to go try the kalbi ribs so we ventured to the Restaurant...on Durango. The place was packed!!!!! There was one table open when we got there! The waitress we had was incredible, super sweet! We ordered the avocado fries, deep fried avocados with 2 amazing sauces drizzled over the top. The batter that they fried it in was super crispy and the avocados were soft but not mushy! Yummmmm! My husband had the kalbi ribs and the furitake chicken with the fried rice upgrade and I had the terriyaki chicken and katsu chicken with the fried rice upgrade and I love their Mac salad so I ordered and extra scoop. The furitake checked was crispy and the sauce was yummy. My husband said the kalbi ribs were really good, great flavor. My terriyaki chicken was so tender and the sauce was sweet and just enough added...not too much! Again, we walked away with a ton of food! They are not stingy on their portions!!!! We will definitely be back as there is more we want to try and with the fantastic food and wonderful service this will become a regular place for us!!!",

I've been here multiple times and I can never get my eyes off the Furikaki Chicken. Highly recommend this one just because of the savory taste of the sauce, the crunchy skin but tender insides and the macaroni salad topping it all off!   In addition to that their potions are fairly big! Along with the pricing of these big portions--worth it!!",

    "text": "Unfortunately many of the poor reviews are True. I've been dining here for many years and this place has gone totally downhill since the new management change.   Portions have shrunk significantly compared to before. We ordered the furikake chicken and not only was it way smaller in size, the chicken was not fresh. It was not hot like before and was very chewy. The rice and mac salad portions have shrunk as well. Food is not as good as before unfortunately. Also, the table next to us took one bite of their cake and left after saying that the cake has a \"vomit aftertaste\". It makes you wonder just how old their desserts are.   Service is unbelievably slow. We had to ask for dishes when we were not given any with our appetizers. On top of that, the server dropped some of the food from our plate onto the table. We didn't really mind because we just wanted to eat after waiting sooo long for our food. The service is extremely slow.   Island flavor used to be our go-to place for Hawaiian food. We are never coming back.",

As we entered, we noticed new renovations and how much bigger the restaurant now was. No music playing, just people dining in, and voices of what I believe is upper management? The ambiance felt like shit if you ask me. When you walk into a local restaurant you want to feel welcomed with island music and workers with aloha, this was not it. But it was a couple months ago...   Ordered saimen and furikake chicken with fried rice. Honestly the saimen was not worth the $9 price at all/ Halfway filled bowl with 2 wonton, probably half a package of s&s noodles topped with egg, kamaboko and char sui. The broth was super salty and wished it came with hot mustard on the side. The furikake chicken was hard to chew, dry and felt over fried. The only good thing was the fried rice which tasted the same.   Our server was nice but looked as if she felt stressed. Don't blame her at all since we read new management took over. Sigh*.",

Meal is good. However, the reason I give it a two star is that we had ordered a to go item 10 mins before we payed our bill. Server had came to inform us that it was missed after 20 mins and had the kitchen do it immediately. Waited 30 more mins till we got the to go item we've ordered. Wouldn't be bad if they gave some kind of incentive like a dessert. Apologies is good but some kind of extra incentive for making us wait especially having 2 kids who are being restless for waiting.  Addendum: We went in to dine-in at 1800, 6/18/19. Ordered to go meal at 1900 and paid the bill at 1910. Didn't get the to go till or close to 1950.",

Midway through lunch a little boy approached our table and offered samples of malasadas. I felt bad that I already ordered a chantilly cake and didn't have room for malasadas. We'll probably be back again being that my other half loves this place.  I got the saimin and loved it, i appreciates that there were wontons in the soup. However, I wish the meat in the wontons weren't so sparse. The food came out quick even for being there at lunch hour. It took a while for our server to get my hot mustard, I was already midway through my meal but still wanted it and it came pre-mixed with soy sauce which I didn't like. My fault I guess, I didn't ask for it to be separate - I'm accustomed to  getting the hot mustard on its own since there was already soy sauce on the table. I thought that was weird.",

Once I arrived I get a greeting from some lady feeding a toddler on one of the tables (I guess owner or boss) but coming from a customer I think that is unprofessional.  I'm thinking \"who are you, a customer or a worker\"? Once I get help, they ask me what I would like to order and I tell them I ordered online thru Chow Now.  I was told that they do not have an order but find out that there was a system error or something and they would make my order right away.  Once I get my order I bring it to my car and check to see if everything I  ordered was there.  Find out I am missing a side salad that I paid extra for instead of getting the mac salad.  Go back and let then know.  I get my salad and I'm on my way.  So now on to the food review....  I think something changed, the prices went up with the food portions went down.  I ordered a mix plate - furikake chicken and tinono pork belly with a white rice and side salad.  Coworker ordered cobb salad.  Furikake chicken was good but tough.  Tinono pork belly could of been a little crispier but maybe that's how the dish is prepared but taste was ok.  I think it was trying to be like pork sisig but no way near the flavor.  Side was excellent as always.  Cobb salad - meat was terrible, removed the meat but the rest of the salad was ok, upside the greens were fresh.  I want to give a better review but with so many issues I can't.  Overall experience was terrible and I think that is the last time I visit this place since there are so many other Hawaiian One eats here on the 9th island.  TRY PAINA CAFE!!!",

What I got: Two mixed plates - one plate with Furikake chicken & Kalbi short ribs and second plate with Korean chicken & Hawaiian style roast pork (takeout)  Would I recommend to others: No.  Would I eat here again: No. My Furikake chicken was soooo dry that it couldn't even pass for chicken jerky. The short ribs were less dry, but lacking in flavor. Roast pork was salty and greasy. Korean chicken was packed together with the roast pork so it was just covered in the same salty gravy...  If I lived any closer to the restaurant I would've taken the food back... at least the inedible Furikake chicken. Looking at the photos on Yelp I would've thought the chicken was their specialty.  Of all fried/battered chicken I've ever eaten (including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Hawaiian, etc.) this one was the most disappointing.   One extra star was for the nice lady working at the register.",

They pulled their Yelp! ordering (now have to go through their website) and you cannot call and place an order for pickup without going through the hassle of giving your credit card over the phone -- which is cumbersome for those ordering on the go (like me).   On the flip side,the new interior is gorgeous and they have taken more space to house more tables,making the in-dining experience much better (less wait time).   I do wish they had a separate counter for food pickups and one to help seat guests and take orders,because there can be some lag time if you are just there to grab your food and go,and it must be frustrating for guests to wait to get sat when there are empty tables all around while someone orders to-go.   Other than that,it is a fine establishment and one of the best Hawaiian spots in the city,with great portions and good tasting food.",

    "text": "We went here for lunch and was extremely disappointed. Many things have changed when Island Flavor was bought by new owners. The atmosphere is nicer however the food changed and it wasn't a good change. One of the top sellers was their furikake chicken. I ordered that today and it tasted completely different. It didn't even look like there was furikake on the chicken. I have attached a picture of the furikake chicken before the new owners and after the new owners. In addition my kimchi tasted sour and watery, nothing like Kimchi or spicy. We also ordered the chefs special loco moco and the patties tasted dry and bland. It lacked the basic seasonings like salt and pepper. On top of that our food took over 1/2 hour just to come out and it wasn't busy at all. We asked the waiter how long does it usually take for food to come out she stated 25-30 minutes usually. We asked to speak with the owner however she was too busy and just said to refund our meals. Thankfully we were able to get refunded. Sad to say Island Flavor will no longer be an option for us.",

This place was poppin, even at 8pm. About 10 people outside and two couples in front of us. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and was pleasantly surprised to see live music  being played inside. They have live music on Friday and Saturday evenings between 6-8:30pm.   We checked out the menu and ordered the furikake chicken 5/5 with fried rice and veggies and the chicken Katsu loco moco 4/5. The servings were extra large which meant plenty to take home for leftovers. Overall delicious Hawaiian style food.  I wanted to try the spam musubi but they were sold out. Will have to give it a try on my next visit.  The desserts also looked very delicious but we were so full we didn't save room.  The service was great and very nice 5/5. And the 10% Yelp cash back made everything a little better :-)",

We ended up ordering way more than we could fit in our stomachs but happy to have enough leftovers for dinner. I had the mixed plate with kalbi and roast pork with gravy. My girlfriend had the loco moco. We shared the shoyu flavored ahi poke as an appetizer. And of course the order of poi.   The roast pork is very moist with great pork flavor. The gravy on top makes it all the more savory. Smothered over some rice and bam! Just a good ol' fashion local kine meal. The loco moco is similar to ones I've had in Hawaii but that is exactly what we were looking for. The ahi in Vegas is not as fresh as it is in Hawaii so the poke wasn't all that great but that isn't the restaurant's fault. Fresh, medium grade ahi for a reasonable price in Vegas has eluded me so far but I'm still hoping to find some. We will definitely be back!",

Honestly, I can't speak for anything else on their menu because I always get this when I'm at Island Flavor, but it's worth the trip and delicious, crispy local goodness here in Vegas.  I'm sure they have many other delicious items on the menu but why bother with something new when it's pretty much guaranteed that you're going to enjoy the furikake chicken? I can attest that it is on par to some of the best plate lunches/chicken dishes that I've had back at home in Hawaii. Now, that's kind of BIG deal considering when it comes to Hawaiian/local food here in Vegas, I'm kind of a snob comparing it to real thing.   Enough said and I think I've already said furikake chicken 10 times in this review already. Go out and get yourself some! The parking is no problem here. And the staff are pretty friendly from what I've experienced. They also have a smaller 'Express' location off Eastern/215 if you're in that neck of the woods.",

Although I can't confirm the authenticity of the meal to Hawaiin cuisine, the meal was extremely satisfying and tasty. I ordered the Fresh Made Ahi Poke Plate with spicy mayo and avocados, and I can safely say that it was phenomenal. The cubes of tuna melted in my mouth leaving the umami of their shoyu and spicy mayo on my tongue. Mahalo.",

    "text": "Cute mom and pop shop that caters to Vegas locals. I hadn't had Hawaiian food in awhile and one of our friends had never had it before so our local friend took us here.  I ordered the mixed plate of kalua pork and furikake chicken. Omg the chicken was soooo good. The seasoningnof the cjicand the crispiness were on point. Unfortunately the kalua pork missed the mark entirely; it was wicked bland and way too chewy as if it had been overcooked - utterly flavorless.  My friend who had the mixed plate with kalua pork and roast pork had the same complaint about the kalua pork as well but she was happy with the roast pork, especially the sauce it came with.   We also had the spam musubi which was good: sauce was appropriately sweet and not overbearing. I do wish the spam slice was thicker.   We also ordered the ahi poke which they forgot and ended up coming at the end of our meal. The servers apologized but that was it. We couldn't really enjoy it as it came well after our entrees and it seemed like they rushed to make it - the seasoning tasted off.  For dessert, we took home a piece of chantilly cake. The cake and buttercream were soooo creamy and smooth. It's pretty sweet so if that's not your thing, steer clear. It's delicious both warm and cold.   I would say for a Hawaiian place, I was really surprised that they screwef up the kalua pork. The only saving grace for me was the furikake chicken and spam musubi so 3.5 stars.",

We got a bunch of things so we could all try and we were all blown away with every dish!    Hoisin Baby Back Ribs: Skeptical at first but dude, these rival the best baby backs that I've ever had.  Perfect crispiness on the outside.  Moist, fall-off-the-bone meat on the inside.  Perfect sweet glaze.  I think this was my favorite thing we tried.  Furikake Chicken: Wonderfully flavored.  Moist chunks of chicken.  Just good.  Kona Coffee: Yep... I'm putting the coffee on here cause it was good.  Another one I was skeptical of cause it came out of a typical diner style 'dennys' pot, but it was actually flavorful.    Chicken Katsu Loco Moco: Probably had overly high expectations on this one, so wasn't as much of a fan as other people, but its still very good.  Gravy is flavorful and the egg just makes everything better.    Guava Cake: We were all pretty stuffed after our meal so we were gonna pass on dessert.  We decided to share the guava cake though and OMG... so good!  Very light.  Not too sweet.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  More coffee please!  The only thing I would complain about is the service.  Dude that waited for us was slow and didn't seem to care.  Yeah, you could call him laid back, but it was almost like he knew he was getting an 18% tip cause we had a party of 6 and didn't even try.  I'm not gonna bash too much, but that could have been improved.   Overall this was a great find and our whole party loved the food here.",

However, when I finally got my furikake chicken I could not wait to eat it! As soon as I got home, I ate that chicken real quick! It's so flavorful and they give you a lot of rice with it! It also comes with Mac! I would highly recommend this place! I saw food coming out from the kitchen and it looked DELICIOUS!

I travelled to Hawaii a few years back and this place brought back a few memories of a few local eateries I use to visit. The staff are friendly and have no problem answering any questions you might have.  I order the boiled sweet potato and the katsu chicken. Both dishes came out in a fairly decent time frame and were presented in a local style cafe. I will say This business isn't about how it's presented, it's about the food and it was all cooked to perfection.  Recommending here will be no problem for sure!! They are great with kids, so a family setting is assured!  My only knock was we did wait a little while for our server to come take our orders, but I think she was pretty slammed, so I can't fault her",

    "text": "Small joint that has a long wait. The service is rather slow, then again they only have 2 cooks, and like 2 servers, even if the place is small, they do make a lot of things on their menu, so you have to be patient if you want to eat here, especially if you have a moderate to large size party.   As for the food, I ordered the roast pork loco moco. When I think of roast pork, I always think I am going to get some charred to crispy pork skin to go with the meat, I didn't, but what I was treated with was some really tender pork meat in a relatively large bowl. It might be the most tender pork I have ever ate. The bowl is large, and they do give you a lot, when I say a lot, I mean that you can probably share with a friend, there is so much rice in the bowl, it is overwhelming. The gravy was decent, nothing too special, you can order the egg however way you like it. I thought overall the roast pork loco moco was decent, needed some seasoning, it was a tad too bland. I obviously didn't finish, so I had it packed up for the road home.  I tried some of my friend's chicken katsu and I thought that was pretty delicious, right amount of crunch, great flavor, chicken wasn't overcooked. I felt like I probably should have ordered that instead, it was also a good size for one person.   They also have several juices, I tried their guava juice, it was a good drink to cleanse the stomach from all the bad toxins incurred from the previous day.",

    "text": "We love Island Flavor. My boyfriend and I discovered it about a year and a half ago on our anniversary. Being from Hawaii, I wanted something that could really replicate the island food choices. There are so many good things about this place.   First, their food is excellent. My boyfriend said it's even better than local food in Hawaii. We've had a variety of different things so far. My boyfriend has tried almost everything that can be chosen for the mixed plate and he has liked all of them. He always upgrades to the fried rice, and I always steal some of his because it's so good. I've had the lau lau (special days only), which was excellent. I like the standard Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, and their sausage is really good. The only thing I haven't been super impressed with is their saimin. It was ok, but nothing super spectacular. Last night, they had friend saimin on special, and it was the best fried saimin I've ever had. Their poke is also good. I like the furikake style.   Second, their portions are HUGE. I mean, we have a friend who can eat A LOT of food, and even he had to take half his mixed plate home. We always have more than two meals when we order their mixed plates. Seriously, it's like a pot of rice when you upgrade to the fried rice.    Third, the people here are always super nice. Coming here really does feel like being back home at a local restaurant. Very local feel, and they always have some local jams on. They also had live music there once when we were there.   Fourth, their prices are so, so affordable. For the quality AND quantity, they are ridiculously cheap. Yesterday, we got out for about $50...for 4 meals, 4 spam musubi, and 2 drinks.   Bottom line, you won't be disappointed. They are so, so good. They do get busy sometimes, so try to get their early, but seriously, go try them.",

I understand that a restaurant must raise prices over time to compete with rising food costs and Ive gladly paid for it.  However, it is terrible when a restaurant  reduces the amount of food given AND charges more.  Plate lunch food has always been about value and taste.  I can no longer justify eating at Island Flavor if I have to pay $15 for a plate lunch, which, to me, is no longer a value.  It was a surprise when I looked at my recent bill and saw upcharges that were not there under the previous ownership.  For less food and $15, I'll save my money and eat elsewhere, especially, if I walk away after a meal feeling like I didnt get my money's worth.  BTW, I take pics of most of my meals at restaurants and the difference is drastic.  As a business person, I wish all the best to the new owners but as a patron, Ill be eating elsewhere.",

I've tried both of these at a few other places around town and Island Flavor is easily my favorite for both.

It really reminds of Hawaii and I love that it's so much more than poke. The plate lunches are also delicious...we've never been disappointed. We usually stop here on our way home so we have something to eat on the long drive back. I love that there's a little market now next door that stocks some great Hawaiian foods, like sweet bread and Hawaiian Sun drinks. The service is always very friendly, if you love Hawaiian food you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "My husband went to this Island Flavor restaurant in S. Durango location & ordered 2 plate dinners & oxtail soup to go. When my mom was about to eat her oxtail soup, she noticed that it was only soup & vegetables inside &   it doesn't have any oxtail at all. I WAS SO MAD & called them back & this lady named I think it was Tiare or Tiana said that they just realize that there wasn't any oxtail after my husband left. How can you possibly forget to put oxtail in my oxtail soup. Don't you need to scoop it & put it in the container. They charged my husband $11 for just soup & vegetables w/out oxtail.  I WON'T BE COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT ANYMORE! Yeah they said they'll put credit for me. I might just get a refund.   They don't have the owner there anymore, the older lady that used to be in the cashier. When she was there, they're not making this mistake. Now that she's not there anymore they keep messing the orders. Last time my husband ordered loco moco w/ over easy eggs they over cooked the eggs. Then on my husband's birthday I want to order haupia ice cream cake. I called they said we don't make it here it's next door Andres World of Cake. So my husband called there to buy the whole haupia ice cream cake. Then when he went to pick it up, it was just haupia cake not ice cream cake. Then after I finished work I stop by @ Island Flavor & told to Tiana that one of their worker told me that they have the haupia ice cream cake next door that's why my husband ordered it there. Come to find out that it wasn't haupia ice cream cake it was actually haupia ice cream pie that they serve at Island Flavor. I told the lady that \"you guys should just corrected me that it wasn't a haupia ice cream cake, but a haupia ice cream pie.\" Told them that my husband was so mad on his birthday because of their mistake. We ended up still bought the cake & I bought 4 slices of haupia ice cream pie because I know that my husband wanted that haupia ice cream pie.",

When we come and sit at the restaurant to eat sometimes the service can be a little off but that's when they suddenly get busy and there's only a couple people on the floor. Musubi's are bomb, I know it's easy to make but seriously the best in town. They're double the size of the other places and just fresher and tastes better. I guess the only thing I don't care for is the roast pork, many rave about it but personally I don't care for it, it's like flavorless unless u add all that gravy, I'd rather eat kalua pork instead. Beef stew is awesome, just like grandmas and any of the chicken dishes are good too. Don't forget to order dessert ! Cakes like theirs are hard to find here in Vegas. The bakery next door can also make a custom cake for you too.",

I highly recommend the tropical iced tea, which is refreshing and flavorful.  My only problem is that everything on the dessert menu sounds delicious, so I cant avoid ordering dessert, and at the same time, I have a hard time deciding what to have. There are a variety of cakes and ice creams that sound wonderful. Last time we split a Kona Coffee Mudd Pie. The Oreo crust and coffee flavored ice cream were perfect.  Definitely trying the banana bread pudding next time.",

I love it here so much that it's near/at the top of my go-to eating spots when friends and family visit town.  It can take awhile to get seated, due to the small amount of tables and seats available, but the wait is completely worth it. When you're seated, your server will be quick to get you your drink(s) and take your order. Never has my order taken more than 15 minutes -- they're really quick with your order, small or big! Speaking of big, their food portions are huge, especially for the price you pay! Most of their dishes are less than $10, but you'll feel that you are getting a $20 meal, portion and taste factored in.  My go-to meal is usually the furikake chicken. If you love breaded chicken and you love it sweet, definitely try this dish! You might even get carried away by ordering one for two people.  Food tastes amazing, and the staff there are just as great as the food! And let's say you prefer to take your food to-go, they're really quick and easy about that. I've ordered from their website plenty of times and had my food ready in about 15 minutes. Mahalo Island Flavor, and see you folks (again) very soon!",

Feeding my Hawaiian food addiction, we finally ventured to Egypt to eat here. I've eaten here before, but it's been years and wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. After looking at pics prior to our visit, we opted for sesame poke, furikake chicken and kalbi short ribs. When our food finally arrived, we both knew there was no way we were going to eat all of it.  The poke came out first. They offer different flavors; furikake, shoyu or sesame. We opted for the sesame and it was delish.  Lots of onions for crunch, fresh fish and a good amount of seasoning. 5 stars.  I ordered the furikake chicken which comes with macaroni salad and I opted for brown rice. For everyone who doesn't know what furikake is, it's a seasoning containing bits of seaweed, sesame seeds and salt. The chicken was fried to a good crisp and the furikake added that extra flavor. The mac salad was good and creamy, a bit heavy on the mayo but it was still good. The only  thing I didn't like was the brown rice. It was just too mushy. It was like normal white rice but brown. I like the pieces of my brown rice not to be stuck together. Had to drop this to 3 stars cuz the rice was a huge disappointment.   The bf ordered the Kalbi ribs. These ribs were like Kalbi ribs on steroids. (Only saying that for description.) They were huge, thick pieces of meat, not the thinner pieces you are normally used to eating. Good char on the meat and good ratio of fat. 5 stars for this.   All in all, solid Hawaiian food joint. I will definitely be back if I am in the area.",

    "text": "The food here is better than some of the Hawaiian restaurants in Oahu.  We ordered the Aloha Friday Special with Kalua Pork and Lau Lau. Both dishes were delicious. The pork in the Lau Lau was very tender and cooked just right.   They give you good portions of food which is more than enough to satisfy your appetite. We couldn't finish all of it so we took some home. Our waitress best described the portion of food as \"Go Big or Go Home\". I think she was right about that.  The staff that work at the restaurant are very friendly and have a great sense of humor. They are very attentive to your needs.   We would definitely return here again the next time we are in Vegas.",

The broth had a savory taste and it was filled with meat and veggies. I like that the rice and mac salad was also included. I like eating rice with my soup because it reminded me of Sinigang . I don't know if I spelled that right but it is a Filipino soup that my mom makes. The mac salad was awesome I could have easily ate two scoops!   I had the guava cake for desert because it was pink ..that is my favorite color . The waitress also recommended it .  The cake was nice and moist and it wasn't overly sweet. If I'm ever near this location  Island Flavor would definitely be on my list!",

The Furikake Shrimp comes with this amazingassness dip, but always tend to ask for lemons for any shrimp I get, it's a Texas thing, or it just me?! Anywayz... the shrimp, lemon and the sweet tangy dip is Onolicious. Don't come here trying to stick to a diet . Enjoy and share the Aloha",

    "text": "We were in the area and decided to visit Island Flavor after reading several rave reviews and checking out pictures on Yelp (mostly just looking at pics). Everyone seemed to praise the furikake chicken, so we ordered that. We also ordered sesame poke and the beef teriyaki after the waitress suggested it as a 2nd entree.   The furikake chicken was described by one reviewer as \"life-changing.\" Well I'm writing this review the morning after and I can tell you I feel like the same person I was before dinner and it truly wasn't all that. The breading is thin and crisp, with a strong sesame oil aroma and sweet flavor. They use a combination of light and dark meat. Furikake chicken is a solid 3 star dish- nothing more or less. The beef teriyaki was teriyaki... the sesame poke was great, though. The cubes of tuna melt in your mouth. Probably could have marinated just a little bit longer, but still delicious. Huge portions!  We also ordered the guava cake and it was both beautiful and delicious. It really doesn't need the whipped cream dollop, though! It mixes oddly with the flavor of the sauce. Our slice of cake was huge and was the best part of our dining experience.   The restaurant was clean and I noticed they have received an \"A\" from the health department. Kinda funky lighting, but still a nice aesthetic. All of their tables have pull-out chairs, no booths. Service was friendly, but it took a very long time before our water was refilled, we were offered dessert, or we received our bill. We probably won't return before trying other bookmarked Hawaiian spots.",

Then, I tried the Long John's loved it. The donut was soft sprinkled with the powdered sugar. The cream filling tasted quite similar to the frosting they put on the cake. It's best not to do short cuts. The demands are high especially when you are serving people who are from Hawaii. It's very hard to beat the first baker who made their Chantilly cakes. It takes time to Master a Chantilly frosting.",

I was down the street looking for lunch and was about settle in to Cafe Rio, but couldn't find a parking spot in the crowded EOS parking lot. I got frustrated and stormed out towards Island Flavor because my buddy ate here earlier in the day. It looked good so I figured, why not?  On his advice, I got the furikake chicken. It's bite sized (a bit larger than bite sized) chicken that's fried, and doused in some sort of furikake sauce (google it so I don't have to explain it), served with Mac salad and rice.  Do yourself a favor and mix a little rice with the Mac salad. It's the gangsta move.  All of this for about $10.  Thank me later.",

The restaurant is on the small side so go early to avoid the wait! But the cozy atmosphere makes you feel like you're in someone's home. This compliments the great service and family feel.  Back to the food though - Roast Pork Loco & Sunday's special Kimchee Fried Rice w/ Korean Chicken. Portions here are HUGE! We had leftovers for dinner and even had some for lunch the next day.  Roast Pork Loco - the pork reminded me of kalua pork, but less salty. Tender, succulent, and when mixed in with the signature brown gravy and some egg yolk .. I can't even. Words escape how amazing this dish is. Each bite delivered an intense pork flavor with egg and rice playing a supporting role. I would recommend getting a side of their mac salad as well to help cut through the richness of the dish.   Kimchee Fried Rice w/ Korean chicken wings - The plate came with a mountain of fried rice, 5-6 wings, and a hefty scoop of mac salad. They make some juicy wangs here! Crunchy exterior, juicy interior, with a sweet kick taste. The fried rice also had a healthy amount of kimchee. They do not skimp on anything here!  Definitely got a taste of island flavor here! I cannot wait to come back to try their other dishes like the Chicken Katsu Loco and Furikake Chicken.",

Think of wet, sticky, juicy fried chicken with some furikake flavor. Favorite thing on the menu.  The chicken Katsu is better than some of the other places I've been to in the city, but the meat to fried portion is still lacking.

We weren't in a rush or anything & never said anything about waiting to our server, but they took it upon themselves to send us out a free app when the food was taking a little longer than usual. Super cool of them! Christine was awesome, took great care of us the whole time. When our meals did come out they were huge! We all got boxes to go and were excited to eat them for lunch the next day",

Was it good? Yes. Was it worth the price? No. Will I be back? Maybe . If they skimped out on the sausage I'm afraid to try their other plates. I'm willing to go back and try a lunch or dinner special",

And their kona mud pie is amazing! A few people can share it on the table and be satisfied. I'll always come back. Would definitely recommend",

This was our first time there and I have to say that the food was great but the service was not. It was not horrible but I definitely think the servers could have been more friendly and helpful. We felt rushed ordering, no recommendations and she was irritated when we asked for extra plates and etc.   Oxtail soup: YUM! I no longer need to go to California Hotel during their midnight special. They gave us lots of meat in the bowl, the broth had great flavor. Only 2 suggestions for this was to give a side of soy sauce and ginger (like Cali Hotel) and give more broth  Kalbi Ribs: WOW! Just Wow! So delicious! Their Kalbi ribs were the BOMB! It was charred with such amazing flavor. Some Kalbi ribs you get just tastes like soy sauce. This was more than that, it was a sweet flavor to it but it was not over powering.   Mac salad: soooo good! It was thick and flavorful.   Chicken Katsu: eh, nothing special. Just like any other chicken katsu on the block.   BTW, their portions are HUGE!",

I'm almost drooling thinking about it. The only menu item I didn't love was the roast pork because it was super salty. We usually order to-go, but we've eaten inside a few times. The restaurant is a lot nicer inside than the shopping center will show you. While the servers are all so nice and wonderful, we've had had some slow service (but only because it was packed, and not at the fault of the staff). We've already eaten here 4 times this month....and it's likely we will be coming back for more soon!",

I always say, maybe it was an off day for the kitchen and give them another try. Disappoints time and time again. Nothing about it is \"crispy\" as it's described on the menu.

The furikake chicken was disappointing; flavor was super subtle... if you're looking to get watered down chicken. Check this spot out. The portioning of the Kalbi was mediocre, I ended up leaving half of it on my plate because it was all fat and bones.   You'd think a spam musubi is impossible to butcher, not today. You're better off opening a can from your pantry because it doesn't look like they cook it or add any sauce to the musubis.  Yikes, all I know is I was smart to stay away that year and so should everyone else.",

I've been coming here since I moved in 2017 and it's always been ono but today was just something else.   Very disappointed into what this place has become. After new management I was iffy about coming here but you know what I came anyways and continued to enjoy my food. Certain days it was ok and other days it was awesome. Today just wasn't the day for me and it's lost my business I got the chefs loco moco and my patty just tasted burnt was not enjoyable at all. My girlfriend on the other hand isn't really a heavy eater she barely finishes a Teri steak plate. Today she got a mix plate with the steak and kalbi. Portion was so small she almost finished it, she would've ate it all but the kalbi was just all fat barely had any meat on it. When she complained to Tina one of the waitresses all she said was sorry with no meaning into it. I am no longer gonna eat here service is horrible Tina should be fired she has no personality or humor I shouldn't even have tipped her but I'm not that type of person. Honestly if you want good local food just go to ohana bbq island flavor is pau no more coming back.",

The doors and windows are darken black. At night, we didn't know if it was open or not! But we saw people exiting and as we approached closer, we could see the lighted interior. Whew! We really wanted to try the food and they did not disappoint!  I ordered the mixed plate with their known Furikaki Chicken and Kalbi Ribs. The chicken is lightly coated with batter and deep fried and then coated with a light sweet honey glaze (my guess!); the pieces were good mouth size and moist and tasty.  The Kalbi Ribs were marinated in teriyaki sauce and then grilled, so tasty!!!  I requested veggies and the Mac salad as my sides. They do offer white rice, fried rice and French fries, too.  My hubby ordered the Oxtail Soup.  The serving was quite generous with 5 good size pieces. The broth was delicious with shredded carrots , chopped celery and slices of ginger.  This is definitely a repeat dish on a cold night!   Our friends ordered Kona Mud Pie to share. It was HUGE and it was perfect to close the end of the meal.   We will definitely come back again to try the other offerings!",

    "text": "Heard Island Flavor expanded as well as went under new ownership, so we had to visit.  Glad to report it's still as good as it ever was!  The fam & I were driving on the SW side of town that night thinking of what to eat for dinner.  It had been a while, so I think it was me that said, \"Let's go to Island Flavor!\"  And off we were!  Got to the parking lot and all looked to be the same outside.  But upon entering - we noticed the place is now much bigger!  Island Flavor knocked down the entire wall to the business next door (which used to be their Hawaiian mini mart of sorts), effectively making their restaurant nearly twice the size!  Lots more room now for us hungry locals, and lots less wait!  We got easily seated in 5 minutes.  But then my anxiousness started because I had to wonder - was the menu under the new ownership still the same??  Fear not my Hawaii friends, the menu for Island Flavor is pretty much intact!  All the usual favorites are still there, and thankfully the size portions are still there too!  Don't be shy...eat all your rice!  Poi too if you got it!  Make you big boys & girls!  We were hungry so we ordered BIG:  -Mixed Plate ($11.50) with Chicken Katsu & Teriyaki Chicken -Mixed Plate ($11.50) with Furikake Chicken & Hawaiian Style Roast Pork -Loco Moco ($9) - 10 oz. homemade burger patty, over rice with 2 over easy eggs & smothered in gravy  Eh!  Still taste the same as I remember!  Glad they didn't change up the recipes too much if any at all - still ONO!  Brok da' mout!!  Island Flavor makes some damn tasty chicken katsu, and thankfully the katsu sauce has flavor too!  Furikake chicken was salty & sweet at the same time, and the Hawaiian Style roast pork was tender & savory with the gravy.  The Loco Moco - who can say anything bad about that?  Great grilled hamburger patty (need those burnt edges), a runny egg, rich gravy...over a Mack truck portion of rice!  Definitely drool worthy!  Aloha spirit is still there at Island Flavor too, gotta love the service for us kama'aina!  Pleasant, fast, friendly, but at the same time no rush for us to get in and out.  Probably could have stayed to talk story!  Island Flavor no worries, you guys still doing good.  Keep it up, we'll be back soon!  Shakas!!",

    "text": "Island Flavor located in a small center on Durango, near Blue Diamond, right across from Rhodes Ranch.  They expanded the restaurant to be bigger, so more tables are available to dine in. Their windows are very dark tinted. In the evening, it's pretty hard to see if they are open or not.  I almost didn't stop by, almost kept driving. I thought they are closed. No open sign on the door or on the window either.  Well, I liked everything we ordered.  I got the Short Ribs $15.99 plus Kimchi $2.99. My friend ordered the Chicken Katsu $9.99. All orders come with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. If you like fried rice, that's extra charge. Our server was very attentive.  I asked if I can taste the kimchi before I order it, because I don't like very spicy food, and I didn't want to NOT like it. So she brought me a little sample, so I could taste it. And I really liked it! I ate a piece of chicken katsu from my friend's plate.  It was very fresh and tasty with the sauce. The short ribs were marinated, very flavorful and delicious! We also had guava juice, and a soft drink. Just for your information, there are NO refills on the drinks.  The restaurant was very busy, but everyone got seated quickly.  I will return to try other menu items in the future, especially some dessert too!",

    "text": "Island Flavor on Durango and Windmill is the original restaurant. When you come on Saturday between 6pm to 8pm, they have live music. I was here for dinner and two gentlemen were performing a beautiful acoustic of \"You Look Wonderful Tonight.\" It definitely got me feeling good. The sound of Hawaiian music brings me back to a time when I used to live on an island and everyone is so friendly and pretty laid back. I was told they had finish renovating the restaurant. It has more open space with simple table arrangement. I like the nice layout, it is a clean look, and the atmosphere feels calm, relax, and serene. They do have wonderful and friendly service and treat every customer like one big family. Joslyn took good care of me. She came to my table with a smile and I really appreciate her attentiveness.   For dinner, I start off with a cold drink and got the Unsweetened Tropical Iced Tea ($2.00). The lemon in the iced tea makes it taste a lot more refreshing especially on a hot day and they do give refill on fountain drink. I especially love Guava Juice ($2.50) and the fruit's natural sweetness. It's like the perfect tropical summer drink that I cannot get enough of. I opt for the Mixed Plate ($11.50) with Furikake Chicken and Korean Chicken. This meal comes with two scoops of brown rice and a macaroni salad and I added a side of sauteed veggies ($1.75).   At the Durango location, this restaurant serve generous portion. I heard that Furikake Chicken was good but when I tried it, the flavor just didn't appeal to me, it taste too sweet. Also, the brown rice taste like it has too much water in it. On a happier note, I did enjoy the Korean Chicken, this has a nice crunch and good savory flavor, and I like the macaroni salad and sauteed veggies with the yellow squash, zucchini and onions, these are good too.   Now my absolute favorite is the Guava Cake ($5.00). They make the cake soft, there's amazing guava flavor, it has a light frosting, it's not too sweet, and it's the best kind of dessert that makes me go \"yum!\" Seriously, it's so good I want to buy the whole guava cake and bring some of that Island Flavor home with me for real.",

The interior decor nothing great but there's just something about it that makes you feel as if you were in someone's kitchen which is nice to me.  The staff and cooks are real islanders so they really know the True island flavors when it comes to cooking what we like.  Most of them even have the pigeon accent, a rarity to find people in vegas that are really from the islands.  The music they play really True to the culture, not no Jack Johnson like what other island theme restaurants choose to play.  The lady serving me was so kind and reminds me of my lola (grandma).  They are not selfish here with their servings. This is the first restaurant where I couldn't finish a loco moco (beef patty, eggs, rice, and plenty of gravy).  I only finished halfway and was already full with no room in my tummy reserved.  It was good because they made it just the way I like my loco moco, heavy with gravy baby.  Can't wait to come back and try their ox tail soup.  Only regret about this place is that it gets you so full that you get very sleepy after.    Another restaurant I'm glad to live near by.  Southwest Vegas really has plenty of hidden treasures.  I did this review on my iphone, now my fingers are cramped and sore.",

Maybe I was too enthralled in all the great conversation with my fellow yelpers, but I could find little to fault in last nights UYE at Island Flavor. It was a great evening in celebration of a really nice guy.   This was my third time here and the third time I had ordered the hoisin baby back ribs. Do I regret ordering the same thing and not deviating? NEVER! I did however shared the love and was shown some back when my companions offered me some of their plates. If they didn't, I would not know how good some of the other stuff was. The steak was delectable. The Korean chicken was perfection in taste and crispiness. The galbi was a disappointment. It was tough and chewy, unlike my amazing ribs. When I lifted one to take a bite, the meat slid right off. My plate was one of the few that went back bare, but I swear I shared.  The sesame poke was amazing and the serving is generous for $9.95. I might eat that when I am craving a \"light\" meal. We ended the night with some dessert. The banana bread pudding was good, but so dense. One bite and I was done. Then again, I did inhale a whole piece of the kona coffee mud pie. Sorry guys, you handed me a spoon and turned your back. I cannot resist ice cream. I still remember someone turning to point at how big the slice was and found a sliver left over. I ended up finishing that too. Both desserts are a great deal at $5.50. Just be careful who you decide to share them with.",

Of course he ate it all.  Beings it was my birthday we ordered dessert, it was a hard decision between the Guava Cake and the Mud Pie.  We chose the Mud Pie, and it was awesome, a huge peice.  Oreo cookie crust, with coffee flavored frozen ice cream like pie with whipped cream drizzled with chocolate & raspberry.    Here we thought oh boy we are packing in the calories & fat tonight when the waitress came over and asked how we liked it and told us that is was carb & sugar free!!

I live exactly 2 miles from Flava but have never been there.  I've driven past it a million times and judging from the outside it certainly doesn't look like anything special. It even could resemble a cheap take out place from the outside but it's certainly not.  Never judge a book by it's cover.   Anyway, I had visitors from NYC coming to Vegas.  For some reason they chose to go this place which they said they go to every year when they come here.  When they invited me to go I was simply happy that I didn't have to go the strip to meet them.   Well, the menu is very large and varied. The staff was excellent towards us, constantly refilling our drinks and all that good stuff.  Since we had 7 people I was able to taste many different dishes. The raw tuna is excellent and you get a pound of it cut up into perfectly bite size pieces.   The burgers, steak and onions, wings, pork were all excellent.  I ordered the Snapper and I got 3 large pieces of fish of which I could only eat one. So, for 14 bucks I had dinner and brought 2 big pieces of fish home with me which was another complete meal for me.  I then finished up with the Mud Pie and as others have said it's not really a mud pie but still very very good and huge. I took half of that home as well.  Now that I know of this place and it's so darn close to my house, I may become an addict.  Especially with the takeout and they do have a delivery service that will deliver for them but I forgot the name of the service but you can just ask them and they will tell you.  It's very well lit up. Maybe a bit too bright but the minute your food arrives you forget about everything else and simply dig in.  I'm so happy my friends found it or I may have never walked in to the place.  Plenty of parking as well. If you live in the S.West this is a must go restaurant.  It will become a once a week gig for me at the least.",

The flavor was delicious, but the kalbi was quite chewy. I love the macaroni salad! The dessert portions were large. We ordered a guava cake and banana bread pudding. The guava cake was moist and sweet... But not too sweet. The bread pudding was yummy but a bit burnt. Overall, I would go back and try it again.",

Nothing over the top. Loco moco is huge with lots of gravy, chicken wings to sweet and kalbi too chewy.   Their dessert though is probably the best in the desert. Absolutely must try.",

Your spoiled in Vegas do anything more than 10 minutes away is too far... I needed to check this place out as my beloved Kauai Cafe is now closed so I needed to find a new spot to satisfy my local grindz.  My default order here has been the kalbi and Korean or furikake chicken with fried rice. I suggest that you washit all down with a POG or lilikoi juice for the \"local\" feel cuz that how we do it on the island.   Just be warned that the plates here are massive! Just look at the pictures of the massive mountain of Ono-kanack food. Always get leftovers. You want to save room for the Ono deserts like the Kona mud pie or chiffon cake.   This is the must eat place I recommend to all my 9th island ohana.   Kanack action  Eat with confidence.  -P",

    "text": "Aloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.  We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors.   With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order.   The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating \"lechon\", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.  It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is True to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!  Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!  Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!",

Waited for another 30 mins for my order. There was another customer waiting for her order that seems she has been waiting for awhile. Got my order food was good. Hope they change how the operations of orders go. Will come back just for food hope that won't go down hill.",

A lot of the time they will not even answer their phone, other times they will answer and instantly hang up, and the worst is when they answer and put you on hold indefinitely. Food wise this is one of the best Hawaiian resturants I have been to, and believe me I have been actively searching for a place to replace this one. I would give the place 2.5 stars but not 3 because the service is a headache its like I have to bother them to take my business.",

The pulled pork, the ox-tail soup, and the loco mocos are awesome.  These meals come with a side salad(including macaroni salad) and rice.    The prices are great and one dinner can feed two people.  The portions are super huge.  If you can still muster up some more, their desserts are a good compliment.  The mud pie is super good!!  Enjoy!",

The chantilly cake was the best it tasted so good!!! I give it 3 stars cuz food was ok & service was ok. Mahalo!",

I was actually surprised to find a sit down restaurant with waitress service. For some reason I had always imagined this to be a counter service place. Clearly, I was wrong!   I ordered the Portuguese bean soup and the Kalua pork and cabbage. Given my limited experience with Hawaiian food, I had never had this bean soup before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The taste was yummy, but I was surprised to find lots of sausage. Probably a bonus for some and expected by those familiar with the soup. The sausage was flavorful, but I only ate a couple of pieces. I confess: I was hoping for more beans!  The pork was super tender, and I adore steamed cabbage, so what's not to like? I found myself wanting to pour BBQ sauce on the pork and make a sandwich like the Southern girl I am, but I was pretty sure they would look at me funny if I asked for BBQ! If anything, the pork could have used a little more salt, but I was impressed at its smoky flavor.   It may be a sin, but you are able to sub the mac salad with a green salad, which I did! I really appreciate this healthier option. The green salad is huge and comes with a couple slices of a sweet purple yam, delicious!   Service was super sweet. I can see why people love this place the way they do!",

But low and behold I heard about this Hawaiian restaurant that opened up and they come from the big island. So u know what that means, had to come and try it.   I was expecting L&L style cuisine the norm for most Hawaiian dubbed restaurants. But was greatly surprised to to see the menu. It still has some classic L&L dishes u would expect. Kalbi ribs etc.   But it's the non L&L dishes the caught my attention. Portugese bean soup (one of my favorites), Aloha LauLau Fridays, hoisin baby back ribs, Korean chicken and roast pork loco moco to name a few.. I have tried all of these and they are delicious.  You must come and give this place a try..",

The plates come FULL of food so you won't go hungry and perfectly priced. The Chantilly cake was recommended but the family wanted guava cake, 3 layers of moist, fruity goodness.

What she didn't say was that it was some of the best food in town period. We started with a little cucumber kimchi which was mind blowing (we ordered another). Some shoyu poke followed which was also mind blowing. Hoisin ribs completed the food-gasm that was this restaurant. Coming back next week for some sweets.",

    "text": "I dragged my dad all the way out here for lunch on Friday..  He was a total skeptic!  He works by the airport, I live in Rhodes Ranch.. he could not understand why we were both driving further from town to have lunch.  The answer is simple - Yelp reviews!  Because of this restaurant, he opened his own Yelp account.  So, we enter.  My dad looks at the menu, I have already stared at all of the pictures on the iPhone app and know exactly what I want.  My dad is quite perplexed by the menu, so I show him the Yelp photos.  When the waitress comes up, he lifts up my iPhone, shows the waitress a picture and says \"I want this\".  The waitress, without missing a beat, responds, \"the pork (something) and beef spare ribs\".  To me, this is the beauty of Yelp.  It brought 2 new customers and gave one exactly what he wanted based on a posted picture.  It was sooo cool!  Our food promptly arrives, and it was everything we expected!  My Beef Teriyaki was incredibly tasteful, savory and tender.  The Korean Chicken was basically buffalo wings with a kick ass flavor.  Any other restaurant, I'd ding one star and recommend they do boneless wings - I hate buffalo wings, but the taste was still so overwhelmingly good that I did not mind!  My dads food was perfect.  He let me try his, I let him try mine.  No wrong choices.  He almost got a full steak attached to each of the 3 spare ribs.  He could not stop raving about the flavor and taste.  Service was swift and meaningful.  I have nothing to say bad about this restaurant.  The check came (less than $25 for two huge lunches),  the portions were so huge that I could not fit all of the leftovers from two starving adults into one box!  Great food, great service, great family run business.  Thank you, Lord... it is right down the street.  I will be back - hundreds of times!",

We ordered their chicken katsu loco moco, which I have never seen on a menu back in Seattle. Everything in this dish was perfect! I love how the katsu had the right amount of crispiness to it. I definitely would order this again for my next visit...and come on an empty stomach.  I also ordered a side of their mac salad and I wasn't a fan of it. It had a little bit of a sweetness to it and I personally didn't like that.  For dessert, we and two other people at our table split a piece of their guava cake. So GOOD! I'm glad we ended dinner on that note.",

    "text": "With my fiance from the islands, I've pretty much adopted Hawaiian food into my diet and trying every single Hawaiian restaurant in town has become a requirement for us. Being that we both live in the west side of town, we usually don't stray too far from our frequent traveled routes, UNLESS it's to fulfill a foodie adventure. On this particular day, we decided we'd finally pay a visit to Island Flavor.   When we arrived, I was immediately drawn to a plate of pre-made, saran wrapped musubis that sat on the register counter for 2 bucks a pop. I thought to myself, how brilliant is that?! We were seated and my eyes were drawn to one flaw-- Several teriyaki and sriracha sauce splatters on the wall. I know, I know... Trust me, I HATE being a stickler for something like that, but it made me feel like a saw remnants of a booger flinger on the wall. ANYWAY, back to the good stuff.  My fiance and I ordered two mixed plates. One beef teriyaki steak and korean chicken and one chop steak & onions and korean chicken. When the plates arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the big portions. Two scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad, and MEAT GALORE! The food definitely tasted delicious. However, as a fan of thinly sliced beef, I had expected my teriyaki steak to be sliced thin as described on the menu, but it was not. It was actually the opposite of what I had expected--The chop steak was sliced thin and the teriyaki beef was more \"chop[py]\". Nonetheless, I ate it.   I hope to visit them again soon to try a few more items off their menu. I think maybe next time even consider sharing a plate to leave room for some of their desserts that I watched longingly pass my table.",

GREAT FOOD! - It was still sunny outside, no curtains. sun beaming on face. tinted windows aren't tinted enough. lol - short ribs were tasty! some fat. 3 huge pieces. - I take that back. the Roast pork was a fail. tasted like roast beef. It had gravy on it. tons of fat.. - My sister had another pork dish. Now that was really good. I recommend that over the roast pork. she also had, i think, fried chicken. very crispy! - My dad had the Ox tail soup. it was delicious. it reminded me of nilaga, a filipino soup.  - My brother-in-law had the loco moco and the patty was HUGE!!! He's like an MMA fighter, big appetite, and he still couldn't finish that. lol. - I shared my meal with my gf. SHARING IS CARING! taste everyone's food :)",

At other places, things are a but too dry, a bit too chewy, a bit too small. This place hit all the marks.   My only gripe was the wings were a *bit* too salty. Just a bit. They've got just the right amount of breading, crunch, moisture, sweetness, and savoriness. They're just a skooch too salty. The Kalbi was the real surprise here. I always feel like Kalbi's a gamble. This kalbi was a good one. Not too sweet, not too chewy, not too fatty, and they give you a nice meat-cuttin' knife just to make it that much easier on you.   This place is dope. I was in a hurry to get back to work, had a brain fart, forgot to leave a tip while paying at the register, I'll be back at 5:10, right after I get off work PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME. FIVE STARS.

Perhaps i shall send someone over to inspect your establishment. That nut and bolt is the same height as small children's head and face area. I would hate for a child to get injured due to your establishments negligence.   Tonight was indeed the LAST time i ever go there. Things were 100 times better with the previous owner. You literally took a go-to establishment and sunk it quicker than a boat with a huge hole in it.   I'd say thanks for the memories but bad food and a bleeding arm isn't something anyone should be thanking you for.",

The items are price friendly, super tasty, and satisfying amount.  Appetizer: Poke with avocado sauce is the best option, make sure you have 2 or more ppl in the party for this, it's  too much for one person and it's not a good idea to take it home since it's raw fish.  Main dish: I love the mixed plate options in here, teriyaki steak is a must for me every time. If you are a meat lover, I recommend you to try Kalbi short ribs with teriyaki beef steak. It just like in the heaven. (Honestly additional $2 fried rice taste just ok) They also have special food item of the day, beef stew is my favorite, it might be on Saturday (not sure).   Dessert: lava cake taste so good! Usually after my mixed plate I can't have dessert right away because I was so full, i just order it to go instead.   Overall: Taste good, great amount, good price!",

We started with the Furikaki Fries and the Hawaiian Poke. Both were excellent and a must have. I had the combo plate with Furikaki Chicken and Kalbi. The Kalbi was tender and well flavored and the Chicken was great as well. My only mistake was not ordering a double Mac salad instead of two scoops of rice. My wife got the Kalua pig plate. The haupia that came with her plate was a good portion as well. Most places that serve haupia only give a small taste but this was enough for two people to share. Island Favor is a great place to come for great food with large portions. Great waitstaff too. They were very nice helping us with whatever we needed. The waitress even got my wife some chili pepper water for her kalua pig.   If you are ever hungry for local food with big portions this is the place.",

Just wanted to let management know what happened. To be clear I've been going to the restaurant since day one and everything has been great until Last night.  was the second time I ordered delivery and now I'm feeling very sick.

Our party had the Korean ribs, Chopped steak, Roast pork, Kalua Pig, Korean chicken, Fried rice omelet, and Fried poke salad. I did sample all of the dishes and would say they are all great with the exception of the pork dishes. I am a big pork fan, so I am particular of pork dishes. Having had Kalua pig in Hawaii I would say it did not meet my expectations. It wasn't as smoky as I would have liked to be, and it was lacking a bit in the flavor department.   Other than that, it was a good meal.  Will be back again.",

With macaroni salad.\" My mom: \"Is that it?\" Me: \"Well they have some unique things. They have something called Kalua pork. It comes with macaroni salad too.\"   So I'm going to be completely honest. I don't even totally know what Hawaiian food consists of. I stopped by once to get lunch to go and ordered a 2-item combo with Kalua pork and tonkatsu. I really appreciated that you could substitute white rice for brown at no additional charge.   The joint's in what looks like a deserted strip mall and the windows are extra tinted to the point where you're not sure if you're in Detroit or southwest Las Vegas, so I'm not ever sure if it's open or not. Either way, it's good to know we have some dining options in our neck of the woods.  P.S. Oh! I forgot to mention there was macaroni salad in my to go order. ALOHA.",

My personal favorites are the korean chicken wings/drummettes and the fried poke plate!  Now, how do you fry poke...isn't the point for the fish to be raw?!....normally that is True but they serve a seared poke that I would describe as mini ahi tuna steak nuggets...served with a huge portion of rice and mac salad.   They offer to cook the poke all the way through, but don't do it unless you want to ruin your meal...just a light sear is all you need for the fish to have a melt in your mouth feel =)    I've also had the katsu loco moco (katsu covered with a fried egg and copious amounts of gravy) and this is not for the faint of heart....I believe my take out box felt like it weighed 5 lbs...this order quickly puts me into \"droopy eyelid mode\".....in other words food coma...so be forewarned.",

The waiter gave us the spam musubi still wrapped in plastic while eating in. Cmon! You can at least take off the Saran Wrap for us so it doesn't look like you just slapped it on the plate.   Our meal took about 45 minutes to come out and it wasn't even that busy. I got tired of waiting and wasn't even hungry anymore by the time it arrived. We ordered the kalua pig and furikake chicken with fried rice. The kalua pig and cabbage tasted really odd as if it had been cooked then microwaved. The fried rice was saturated in soy sauce and not thoroughly dispersed. The chicken was good but overcooked.  I just think they forgot about our order and then half assed it.   We do love Hawaiian/island food so we will try again, but maybe not this location. My husband felt sick when he got home too so that didn't help. I do want to note that they did offer a free dessert for the long wait but we were over it by that point. They knew something was up though because we never complained and they just kept asking if we were ok.",

    "text": "I am not a big Hawaiian food fan, because so many of them butcher kalbi (no pun intended). Island Flavor has the best kalbi I have ever tasted from a Hawaiian joint, and their portions are huge! I got like 6 big pieces of meat! Also, I chose their salad instead of the mac, and shut the front door, the dressing was divine! And the craziest part is that they are known for their chicken and mac... If their kalbi n salad are this good, the chicken and mac must be way too killer!!! First time Hawaiian foodies, go straight here -- skip L&L!!!!!",

True Hawaiian food at its best!!! I found this restaurant through Yelp and it is worth the (less than) 20 minute drive from the strip.   My boyfriend & I split the Furikake Poke, while he opted for the Fried Rice Omelet with Portuguese Sausage and I got the combo with KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and Teri Beef.....Omgaaaah, so delicious (or should I say \"ono\"!) The portions were monstrous, but most importantly, the food was amazing.  I have been craving REAL Ahi Poke and I'm so glad I got to have my fix here! Huge chunks of fresh Ahi Poke sprinkled with Furikake mmm, it was perfect. I have also been on a Korean Fried Chicken kick recently, and Island Flavor definitely got it right. So crispy, juicy and garlicy! The Teri Beef was great quality (not thin or stringy at all) and the sweet sauce was the clincher. No lie, everything we ate was amazing....even the Mac salad and Guava Juice!  I am definitely going to try to come here next time I'm in Vegas :) Now seriously, can we get a Hawaiian joint as good as this in So Cal? Enough L&L, I want an Island Flavor haha!",

    "text": "This is a great place to go for island food! The place is like a little hole in the wall. When I walked in I didn't expect to see so many people. The place is literally just a small square. The girl that seated us was very nice. I ordered the chicken katsu and the teriyaki beef. It was very good. The quality of the meat seemed to be better than other island style restaurants around town. The chicken on the other hand was on the soft side. I guess you can say I like my chicken a little more \"well done\". (Hey, you can't please everyone! ) After I ate I ordered the \"huapia cake\". Unfortunately they were out of it. I was disappointed because my friends dessert arrived and then they told me they didn't have mine :-( I ended up ordering the \"huapia ice cream pie\". The cake was cheaper than the pie so our waitress charged me for the cake for the inconvenience of not having it. Let me tell you the pie was amazing!!! The creamy texture of the ice cream was so nice and rich. Is was really really good. It comes with nuts, honey and raspberry sauce drizzled on top. Over all, I like this place and would recommend it to my friends and family. I can't wait to go back and try the cake! Lol",

The Hawaiian moral code to eat plentiful, and well is sure to meet those standards here. I did decided to get the chicken teriyaki salad. One word. AMAZING! The portion was huge!!! It had these huge slices of purple yams which were fresh, sweet, and oh so delicious. The sesame dressing? To die for! And it makes a great combination with the greens on the salad and the chicken teriyaki on it.   The service was great, and our waitress was very friendly. Our waitress did slide a few witty jokes here and there. She also enganged in starting small talk which I think was very nice and hospitable of her. The place is small, but I feel that the envorniment and homely atmosphere makes it appropriate for the place to be small, and decorated with very small and simple paintings and decoration.  I see why it's a five star dine in experience. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

When we came today, the service was a little disappointing. I felt like we waited a while to be seated because it seemed like there was only 1 waitress. When we finally got seated, we waited more longer for the waitress to help us even get our drink order. As it started to get even more busy, she became less attentive. When she would come over to the table, she was very short with us. At the end of our meal, it took us a while to even flag her down for the check too. She was extremely busy with all the other 14 tables she was waiting on by herself.   Aside from all of that, let's get to the food rating.  Spam Misubi 10/10. Can't go wrong with the misubi, my kids love It! We ordered the mixed plate with Furikake and Kalbi. 11/10!!! This plate was VERY VERY flavorful. My husband and I loved it so much! My kids both killed their Kalbi short ribs plate.  This IS the entire reason why we came back. I don't know what went wrong this morning, maybe someone called in sick and they were short staffed. If the service is like that all the time, I would rather just take food to go instead.   Even though the service was not as great, she was still nice and friendly. The food was BOMB! Will def come back either way.",

Island flavour is just about that - from the moment you are greeted warmly and ushered to your table to simple, yet delicious comforting food. It instantly makes you think of home, family dinners, peaceful feeling of safety.   We had three dishes - each one of them was equally skilfully cooked:  1. Hawaiin roast pork, cooked local style with Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin, topped with rich brown gravy (9 USD) 2. Lau las, served with haupia, Friday special (11.25 USD) 3. SPAM musubi (2.25 USD)  The portions are great, we had almost have of what we've ordered packed to go. The pork was melting away in the mouth like butter.   We'll be back for sure.",

I know that I have read that most of the staff has stayed the same, but they are definitely under new direction.   The furikake chicken didn't have any furikake on it. The pork was dry. The kalbi ribs were smaller. The loco moco meat was not seasoned well. My nephew liked the Korean chicken and I thought the teriyaki chicken wasn't bad.

Ultra thin slices of W T F ? !  Bones were thicker than meat and fat. Aaarrrgh!!!  Huge expanded dining area is a grand space to no longer have live entertainment. It's okay, really. More room to fake aloha. Did your consulting agency recommend that, too???  This not just a kalbi complaint. This more. You faking it. You selling junk to people who know the difference and can properly pronounce items on menu.   Another hard hit. Like a stone to eye. Monkey miss Auntie Maile, her wonderful staff and the quality home cooking that helped me and brought families together.  ***Thanks to Alisa P. of new \"owner, Allie.  No more Auntie Maile.\" for correcting me with shady tone. Terrific response in private, really. And we see you've deleted all your defensive responses to all other unfavorable reviews.***  \"Kalbi from exact same vendor.\"  Sure, same vendor, but instead of 4 slabs of short ribs that cover plate, you cut 1 slab into 4 pieces!  Monkey not only one. Many know. Many have come long time. Many can tell difference, can spell and say menu items correctly. Monkey no manini. You fired good people and cut so many corners, you change direction.",

    "text": "Decided to come here for the first time to this location after work recently. I think I've been to their sister location in the north? (off craig and something by poke express) but correct me if im wrong xD   I had put the order in on yelp prior to leaving work, but since it was so close to work, I still at to wait at the restaurant.   Located just south of the Rhodes Ranch entrance on Durango, by windmill, it sits in a small shopping strip with some other places (totally looked but don't remember whats near by)  The restaurant itself is a decent size and was pretty busy, considering it was dinner time anyway.. Lol the kitchen was pushing out food really fast but it still took another 10 minutes or so for me to receive my food. Coincidentally saw Melissa because she was picking up food too xD   I had ordered the \"Furikake Chicken\" to go w/ fried rice and mac salad. The Furikake Chicken is a deep-fried boneless chicken tossed in a furikake glaze.   Let me be not the first person to say this, but to some people, me saying this may have more of an effect... HOLY THESE PORTIONS ARE HUGE ! Even with a fairly empty stomach after work, I barely ate half. The other half was saved for the next day.   Not only was the amount of chicken a lot, even the fried rice portion was larger than expected. I'm not complaining about the amount of food. Its a great thing for the price you're paying. For me, it was two meals. For some smaller eaters, this could easily be 3 maybe 4 meals.   I was a bit scared in the beginning because a friend of mine went to another location on eastern and said this chicken was bland. Mine was nothing but bland. sweet and savory sauce covering huge chunks of deep fried chicken, its like the Hawaiian version of orange chicken? XD ok not really...   The fried rice was filled with ingredients. good size pieces of Chinese bbq pork.   Not much of a fan of mac salad overall. It seemed like a normal mac salad.   Overall, food was good. Overly stuffed from it. Wonder if other stuff is made to these sized portions as well?? time will tell... until the next time I work nearby :P",

    "text": "I am a regular customer of Island Flavor Durango location) and was very unhappy the other night with one of their recent changes. ( FYI, since the news owners have taken over the business many of us \"local Hawaiians\" have been irritated with the new \"rules.\").  For the past 3 years I always order 1/2 pound of poke to go. I usually order the fried shoyu poke and the kitchen has always been accommodating until the other night.  I was told that I could no longer order the 1/2 pound of the shoyu poke if I wanted it fried?!? I had to order the fried poke plate which consisted of 1 lb. of poke, rice and Mac salad.  Shoyu poke is shoyu poke fried or not!!  To the cooks...let's get real. Your grill is on and it doesn't take more than a minute or two to sear the poke.  What is the problem? To the owners...is $16.95 for the plate the reason for this recent  change? I happen to order the 1/2 lb size because my husband is not able to eat that.  I'm sure that you're making a \"killing\" monetarily but watch out...Us local people from Hawaii stick together and many of us don't want to return. There's a lot of us here and we sure are spreading the word. You've lost so many of the original staff members, some of your portions have gotten \"manini\" (smaller), your prices have increased and you have too many \"chiefs\" in the kitchen.  When Uncle owned the restaurant we never had these problems because he truly believed in the aloha spirit.  Thank God for Edna and Kehau who are so kind and know what they're doing.  To the owners:  be humble and learn the True meaning of aloha! ..",

    "text": "Overall: Island Flavor serves up some good food, and the service is great.  Food: 4  Mixed Plate with Kalbi Short Ribs and Furikake Chicken: For the price, this dish was very worth it. There's enough for at least two people, maybe even three if you don't eat a lot. The kalbi short ribs had a nice char, and it had the actual smokey taste of being cooked on a grill. The furikake chicken was crispy, and it had a really tasty glaze. It might even be better than orange chicken.  Sweet & Sour Short Ribs: I know a lot of people who would absolutely love this dish, but it wasn't for me. The short ribs were tender, but they were drowning in a bowl of sauce that was too sweet and too sour without any balance.  All orders come with two sides. The usual is white rice and macaroni salad, but we subbed the macaroni salad for stir fried veggies in both. The white rice is pretty good and similar to Korean rice, so its higher starch content makes it a little sticky. The stir fried veggies was mostly zucchinis and it was well-cooked.  Service: 4  The servers were really nice and they even thought to bring out extra plates for us to share. They were pretty attentive, and they stopped by frequently to ask if we needed anything. Although the thought was nice, I would have actually preferred if they didn't ask quite so often (~4 times in a one hour lunch). The shop is small enough where I can flag one of them down easily if I needed anything.  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. It isn't a super large restaurant, but it has plenty of tables and it doesn't feel cramped and it's pretty clean.",

Bathroom was very clean. Tables are cute and modern. Very comfortable. Makes you feel that island hospitality. We sat down and ordered our food. The food came out so fast. We waited maybe 5 minutes. Order the Furikake Chicken. You will not be disappointed. The only critical thing I have to say is that the food was warm. Not hot, but so delicious.

We always order extra to keep for snacks later.   Terriyaki chicken is super flavorful, thin pieces of white & dark chicken.   Chicken katsu is very tender & perfectly fried every time. Nothing's worse then getting over fried hard katsu.   Furukaki chicken is so delicious but very rich & salty. I can only eat a little, but it goes so well with rice & mac salad. Fried nuggets of chicken tossed in a furukaki glaze.   Saimen is traditional saimen but they add wontons to it so it's like saimen meets Chinese wonton soup. I get it without egg bc it's little pieces of scrambled egg, not thin strips so I'm just not a fan of the egg.   The portions are very large so we usually order 3 full plates & a musubi for everyone (3 adults & 2children) and it's more than enough.   They deliver on bite squad but if you call in for pickup yourself it's usually ready in 10-15 min, even on busy weekend nights.   They have a small store next door that sells Hawaiian food to make at home.",

And you'd be correct. The thing is even after they expanded it's gotten worse on the wait times. We try not to go at peak hours. Last time we went, we were there for about 10 mins, seated about 20 mins and no one even got a drink order or anything yet. At that time we walked out. It seems their staff may have been hit with a flu bug going around. So we waited about a week and it was pretty much the same thing. Craving great Hawaiian food we decided to get a all in order. My fiance ordered it on her way out of class at can Charleston. Took her 40 mins or so to get there with stopping to get gas. She still had to wait another 30 mins, and even though she tripled checked with the guy when she got there, our order wasn't exactly what we wanted. Close enough but not perfect. Still the food was great. If they could get their wait times down to an acceptable range this place would be perfect. BUT if you have time to waste and want to hang out with family and friends. It fits perfect. I've done that more then a few times here..",

However, I was extremely disappointed by their service a few days ago for a catering order I was picking up. I placed the order two days before, and the lady helping me was extremely nice. However, when I came to pick up my food on Saturday, the manager was very condescending when I asked where the plastic utensils were. She was extremely snappy in saying that utensils were not included (even though I confirmed with the other girl 2 days before that utensils were part of the service). Instead of working with me, the manager questioned me about who told me they were free by pointing around the restaurant to see which server to blame. I placed a $450 catering order, I'm sorry it's hurting your sales that much to provide me with $5 worth of utensils. She offered me 10 utensils with hesitation (even though I needed 30). She then asked me why I couldn't just buy my own???? Probably because you already promised me the utensils would be included 2 days previous? She finally gave in. NOT ONLY THAT, but I was stuck tugging along the entire catering order by myself to my car without being offered help by any of the staff. I won't be bringing my money here any longer. I was thoroughly disappointed at something that could so easily have been mended!",

I didn't know that this place was a sit-down restaurant which it makes sense to me now that the one on Eastern says \"Island Flavor Express\" in their store front.  My boyfriend and I were craving fried chicken so we decided to dine here for their well known furikake chicken. It was pretty busy for a weekday night but didn't expect our order to take so long to come out. It took over forty minutes to arrive to our table from the time we placed it. We thought this place would be a quick eat. Although we didn't really have a designated server (I think) , I wish someone like our server who took our order would've told us that their kitchen was backed up or something at least. Most of the workers didn't look so happy to work there especially the hostess/cashier in front had the most annoyed look on her face whenever people came in & she was walking them to their tables. The only server that was actually friendly to us & the other tables around was the guy server. As for the food itself , furikake chicken was tasty and large portion to share for 9$. I love the food at both locations & think that it's way better than other Hawaiian establishments around Las Vegas. It's probably just better to just order to-go or for takeout here. Other menu items I recommend that I tried from their other location: THEIR SPICY AVO POKE (worth ordering by the pound) , chicken katsu , kalbi short ribs , and all of the desserts (their chantilly and guava cake slices are bomb).",

Our food came, my sister was in the middle of explaining what was missing from her order and our server quickly cut her off and said, \"I'll tell you what you ordered.\" My sister was missing an extra order of macaroni and it never came. She didn't check on us or refilled any of our beverages. When it came to paying the bill I really did not want to tip her, but she was hovering everyone that was paying and I did not feel comfortable. She needs to fix her sh*tty attitude cause that b*tch didn't deserve any tip.",

One thing that would have given this a 5star was the service. Got seated and wait about 10-15minutes just for the drinks and another 10-15minutes for the food order. Other then the service I would recommend this place to others.",

For those of you that know and have been to Rainbow Drive In on Oahu, you will surely be a fan of this place.  First off I have to say that the portions here are HUGE!!!! So come hungry or be prepared to share or take a doggy bag home.  The mixed plate comes with your choice of two items off the menu, along with 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I've had the Portuguese bean soup, the Kahlua pork and cabbage, the Hawaiian style roast pork, and the chicken Katsu, and all were delicious.  Both times the pork has been done perfectly, tender and still juicy, which was a nice surprise.  I also liked the brown gravy that they served the roast pork with, it added just the right amount of richness to the dish.  I've also tried the lomi lomi salmon, and it was tasty too, but I'm just not a huge fan of salmon so I didn't think that much of it overall.  The service here is great, and the ladies, when they're not run off their feet, are happy to chat with you, and play do we know anyone in common from back on the islands.  Prices are great considering the amount of food you get here.  Overall, I say go go go if you want a taste of real Hawaiian food.",

A lot of my family are from the islands so their input was very important to me.  They loved the food there which can add to the authentic feel to it.    I give it 3 stars because of their  service.  Though they were friendly when we first walked in, their untimely manner upset me.  I am a huge water drink and when they didn't refill my water it irritated me a bit.  I had to wait approximately 15 minutes just to get my water refilled.  Maybe it was just yesterday when I went.  I will come back again and hopefully the service will be better.",

So, glad we did!    Very large portions, great taste, waitresses were very friendly with locals,  ours was pleasant- no complaints!   We had the biggest portion of Poke' ever,  pork with cabbage, and a mixed plate.  We had  2 to go boxes left over,  Can you say, cold cabbage and pork for breakfast.  Lol   I ordered the cake for dessert, nothing compares to Saimin Says where we live...so that's why I deducted the star. Would have done a half star..but not an option. lol It wasn't great it was ok!    Overall we made our family jealous with pics of our food and prices were fair for the portions.   Definitely going back in Nov with family.  :)",

You know how i always mention Love, it's because I believe Love is an ingredient in amazing food. Also in life, but thats a story for another time :)  Hands Down, The fried stuff the grilled stuff and idk maybe the baked stuff.. MADE WITH LOVE. If your looking for healthy, good luck finding that here, but this place makes food to make your taste buds pop.   MY FAVORITE: the chicken wings, extra crispy, with the sauce on the side. I do that so that when i get my chicken wings i can still have the fresh crispy wings and not let the breading get too soft and moist. LOL! i said soft and moist, of course were talking about breading on the chicken wings, and thats a big NO NO.  THIS PLACE, PERFECT! service, food, seating, price. maybe a better bathrom but hey i can pee before i leave the house :)",

We waited for quite a while before our waitress came by to let us know they ran out of white rice. She gave us the option of waiting for the white rice or changing it to brown rice. Since our kids were really hungry we decided to change to brown rice. We were assured that our food will be out right away. We continue to wait. We thought we would get our food right away since we decided to change to brown rice. The table next to us came in around the same time we did and were also given the option of waiting for white rice or brown rice. They opted to wait for white rice. They received their food before we did even though we had opted not to wait for the white rice. We received our food about 10-15 minutes after them. We had to ask about our food multiple times. The food was ok. I really wanted to like this place.",

We phoned in our order and were a little disappointed that they didn't have mashed potatoes as a sub for the rice on one of our orders, it is on the menu. I zipped over and picked up our order and shot home to the wife with a bag full of Hawaiian goodies. The teriyaki steak was good but nothing out of this world... maybe I was looking for a tad more flavor from the meat. Don't get me wrong, the steak was good, but could've used a little seasoning and to be less reliant on the teriyaki alone. The rice was good sticky rice and the macaroni was pretty good too. The furikake shrimp was a good size portion, 7 large butterflied shrimp, but was a bit on the overcooked size and a noticeable dark brown was given to the panko crumbs. Again, good sticky rice and my wife enjoyed the side salad. Island Flavor did nothing wrong and we would try them again in the future but nothing really stood out to us as being out of this world. Maybe we should try eating in next time?",

I should have tried some of the more colorful dishes like the korean chicken.  Also, should have ordered a side of kimchee to put on top.  This place definitely has gut busting portions and good prices.  That's why I gave it the 4th star.  I'll try it again but next time it's the korean chicken wings",

The storefront had blacked out windows and I thought they were closed. Went inside and was blown away by the heat! It had to be over 90 degrees in there! Oh well hope my order doesn't take too long. Decided on Kalbi ribs and Teriyaki chicken. Also got an order of banana bread pudding and haupia cake. The portions were large. Both plates came with 2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad. Rice is rice and Mac salad was okay.. Kind of bland though. The Kalbi had great flavor ( I should know .. I'm Korean) but could've been a little more tender and was a little too fatty. I think the highlight was the chicken. They were super flavorful , tender and so juicy!!! The bread pudding was enough for 4 people and pretty yummy. The haupia cake was to die for !!! All in all I was pretty happy and would go again and try some other items on their menu. Just too far to go regularly.",

It's the kind of restaurant where you really wish that a) they offered a sampler menu, or b) that you could somehow figure out a way to eat 7 entrees.  We had a large group, and every meal was amazing.  This is the real deal, folks.",

    "text": "Katsu loco moco = End Game FATALITY  They seriously should have an eating contest with these wonderful bowls full of NOM NOMness because id like to see the person who could kill one of these they are so damn big. The place is sort of like a hole in the wall but im not complaining as its close to home which is nice. The decor is sort of like what you would expect of the floor plan of a sushi restaurant with the center wrap around bar section where you expect to see a sushi chef behind serving it up. But its relatively clean and its not like i wanted to dress up to go eat island food.  The good part, the grub! my brother said the Katsu loco moco was where its at so i ordered and maybe not even 10 minutes later the cook in the back who kinda reminded me of tattoo face from \"50 First Dates\" had my tasty bowl mounded with a heap of food. This bowl had to have at least 4 scoops of rice in the bottom, 3-4 full chicken breasts breaded and well cooked, 2 eggs, and covered in brown gravy and a sprinkle of green onions. Honestly i was overwhelmed by the amount of food as when i saw the $8 and change price tag i thought it was a lil bit much for what i ordered, till i learned that it could feed me for 3 meals. Well made with all the right flavors, my only issue ever so slight was that the eggs were sliiightly under cooked so the whites were still jelly like. Aside from this i was pleased with the food.   Location/ decor - 6/10 would get a 5 but its close so thats a point 4 me Service - 7/10 nice people, nothing special but not bad either Food taste - 7.5-8/10 simple food, simple flavors but well put together Value - 9.5/10 big food for very good price, one order can feed two  All in all this is my go to spot for when island food now. I use to make the drive all the way to Aloha Kitchen previously but now its down the street and reasonable. I will be back without a doubt... come hungry!",

I had the roast pork and I could not finish that plate as much as I tried to. We've also had their fried rice with egg and portuguese sausage. I really like this place and they seem to get alot of people in. The only cons of the place is #1 their closed in Sunday and Monday, #2 the place should be bigger because it seems sorta small and sometimes their people waiting outside or their cars just to eat there.",

We had to do that on the second day because it was packed but they still got our food out quickly. It was worth having to eat in the car lol   We also had the poke which was bomb  The Guava Cake and Chantilly Cake were also our favorites. We will definitely be back whenever we are in town.

The one thing that stands out is the portion sizes. You will not get bigger Hawaiian BBQ sizes anywhere. The teriyaki sauce isn't the best but it is still pretty decent. I am not a fan of the breaded chicken and the fried rice didn't really do it for me. But hey, maybe I just don't understand traditional Hawaiian dishes.

The Kalua pig and cabbage dish was soooo good with SO MUCH MEAT. The meat was soft and juicy and the cabbage made the dish complete. The Furikake chicken was addicting as well. I don't know what they put in the marinade but I love it. Now, both of these dishes were ginormous and we were overly stuffed in the end. Each dish could easily be two dishes.

Unfortunately, this recent visit wasn't as good. First when we entered, the hostess was on the phone, didn't acknowledge us to at least say, \"I'll be right with you.\" She was on the phone for a good 10 minutes and when she was off the phone, didn't greet us with, \"Hello, welcome to Island Flavor.\" Just, \"how many?....eating here?\" She walked us to a table, left the menus on the table and walked away. No \"your server will be right with you\"....NOTHING! The waitress had a great \"customer service\" personality. I was amazed that for $15 and some change for Kalbi, the plate came with ONLY 4 strips of kalbi. Unreal!!! Last time we ate there, there was way more than 4 strips. Also no ingredients listed on menu for those with possible food allergies. Mac salad was a little too \"crabby\" with crab. The pork belly with tomato and onions had literally no sauce in the bowl. So it was very bland. The Korean chicken wasn't crispy and lacked that Korean flavor. It was really disappointing, especially how far we drove just to eat there.",

Portions are huge and the whole place has an authentic relaxed plate lunch vibe to it. Better table management and shorter wait times would get them up to 5 stars. The food and service is already there.",

He also decided to get the Portuguese sausage fried rice to bring home too. The spam musubi's were huge!!!! bigger than what I had in Hawaii, but they were delicious. Rice was cooked perfectly and the spam was not too sweet and not too salty. One spam musubi would have filled me up, but since I'm a hungry hippo I just had to try the fried rice. Fried rice was good, maybe a lil too soggy for my tastes, but that's Hawaiian style? It came with 4 big pieces of sausages and there was a huge scrambled egg on top. The rice itself had lil pieces of BBQ pork which was fatty but tasty. Overall, I was pretty impressed and I know I will be returning for more musubis!!",

I've never been to a place where i've felt outright ignored. It was that bad.  Is there no standard knowledge of basic service and etiquette here? Everyone working here seemed so careless and oblivious. No sense of urgency or organization. My friends and I entered and were not looked at, checked on, acknowledged, greeted, accommodated, nothing. I didn't know if I should've sat myself down or just wait and give them a chance (shouldn't have). Nope, just left to stand there like unwelcome guests as some lady at the cash register took care of some payment and then WALKED AWAY without acknowledging our presence. Hey guys, you do know customers enter through your front door, right?  After eating (which seemed like an eternity to get to that point), I raised my hand at least 5 times to ask question about the check, even speaking out to get someone's, anyone's attention. None of the employees looked my way. At this point I was beginning to question if these people were normal. A waitress briefly saw me with my hand RAISED and everything, but then she immediately changed direction and focused her attention elsewhere, striking up a conversation with a table of people she seemingly knew. Are you kidding me?? Fed up by now, I finally had to GET UP from my table to get this stupid little simple ordeal done and to finally pay.  Ditch this place.",

Frank and I stopped by here on our way to check out our new home nearby, and when we walked in it felt as if we were back on Guam at some mom and pop restaurant.  The staff is friendly and helped a lot when it came to choosing lunch.  I grabbed their ribeye steak with white rice.  It comes smothered in grilled onions and mushrooms, just how we make it back home.  It was delicious, but I have to say that they have this adobo-like chicken dish that Frank ate, and the sauce was CRAZY GOOD.  I poured it over my steak and rice after tasting it!  Love the food, love the people, and I will stick with the local fare rather than their American choices, because they do their food the best.  '  Oh, and save room for dessert.  Their haupia cake is HUGE and can feed four people, or two hungry islanders like Frank and I.  Stop by, say hello, and chow down at island flavor.",

Fried rice was good. White rice and Mac salad was ok.  Prices are cheap for the large amount of food you get. We took most home and had the rest at dinner.

Since we were such a large group it took a bit to come out, but the wait was well worth it! The portion sizes were ridiculously huge, so I had enough for both lunch and dinner!  I got a combination plate with the Hawaiian roasted pork and the Teriyaki beef. The roasted pork is something dreams are made of! It is almost like turkey, but slices of fork tender pork covered in the most delicious brown gravy. This was the highlight of my meal and the white rice just balanced out each bite. The teriyaki beef was also good, a little chewy, but I loved the sauce. I also tried the Chicken Katsu covered in the Korean chicken sauce. It was crispy and delicious! I wasn't a fan of their mac salad, although I tried it a couple of times just to be sure.    Now, Island Flavor really excels at dessert! They get their cakes from the bakery next door and they are seriously out of this world. The Chantilly cake is beyond amazing! Run, seriously run now and get a piece. It is the most moist and delicious chocolate cake. I also enjoyed a piece of the guava cake today! It has the best whipped cream frosting which makes each bite so delicate. This is definitely the pinnacle of Hawaiian food in Las Vegas, you won't be disappointed!",

The pie is made up of homemade fragrant Kona Coffee ice cream on top of a Oreo cookie crust.  It comes with a side of whip cream, and topped off with crunchy peanuts, chocolate & raspberry sauce.

There was a wait and there is no where for a waiting party to sit, so we had to go outside abs stand or sit in the car.   The decor.....well there's no decor or even an attempt at one. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall and it shows for it.   Food was good, the Chicken Katsu a bit flavorless but still good. The Portuguese Bean Soup tasted more like Pork and Beans from a can, it was just ok.   Eating in freezing temperatures is not fun and the servers weren't the friendliest.

I ordered the Mixed Plate with Kalbi and Chicken Katsu. One thing many people have said about this place is the large serving size. I figured, by ordering the mix plate (choice of two items), I would definitely be able to bare witness to the large portions. I was mistaken. They made it look heaping, but it was an illusion. All in all, there were 5 short ribs, and 7 small strips of chicken.  It didn't get any better with taste. Okay, the Kalbi was okay, but I have, without a doubt, had better. My wife and in-laws are Korean. It's hard to beat authentic Korean Kalbi. So, I'm willing to let the Island Flavor slide on that. I can't, however, give any slack on the chicken. There was more breading than chicken, and it didn't have ANY flavor, let alone Island flavor. I'm guessing this is why they give you the small little cup of dipping sauce. After taking a bite into the unnaturally crispy strip, you can vaguely see a sliver of chicken.  The fries are good. But I don't visit restaurants just for their fries, except maybe Gordon Biersch.",

Came in a couple of times since new ownership took over, and found that this location positively compares to experiences at the Eastern location. Interior has been upgraded, staff have been friendly and attentive, and several new dishes have hit the menu.  Their plate lunch dishes are the focus, and the furikake chicken and shrimp are go-to orders for me. Took a friend, who really liked the teriyaki chicken. All proteins were juicy and not overly sauced, and amply portioned for leftovers. Got to try the new Avocado Fries app and was really impressed at how it maintained texture. Always go with an appetite and/or group, because their desserts can't be missed- the Kona Coffee Mudcake is my favorite, they also offer haupia and guava, all slices are $5 and the size of your head, easily.   Some of the only things I haven't tried yet here are the poke and daily specials- but it's only a matter of time with dishes like kimchi fried rice. Both locations are a bit of a drive for me but this is the one that I prefer, looking forward to returning for the Poke Bombs and spam musubi.  TIP: Order your takeout ahead of time with GrubHub via the Yelp app. Not all dishes are listed (MP items excluded), but all the favorites are there!",

Not our fault she forgot, but then we had to wait again for her to fix that and bring back another tab.  Too long, she should have just let that go since SHE forgot it, not us.  **Stars for: Lau lau, haupia, sesame dressing & fruit punch that was good and nice looking renovation & cleanliness of the restroom.

    "text": "This review is for last nights experience. Most of my visits to Island Flavor is 4-star. But last night, what you did was shady.   Yesterday, my niece and nephew drove to Las Vegas from SoCal. Because of the Friday traffic and two accidents, they were running 2-hours late. Whenever they come to Vegas, the routine is to have Friday  dinner at Island Flavor for the Lau Lau plate. Because they were running late, they called in their order from Primm as they would make it to the restaurant at about 8:45 pm, 15-minutes before closing.   My nephew-in-law ordered a mix plate of furikaki chicken and Korean chicken while my niece got furikaki shrimp. Both plates they upgraded to fried rice. When they got to the restaurant, the male cashier did show them the plates and opened it up as they got a yuck glance. However, when they got to my house, tired from working, sitting in traffic and a longer than usual drive, I was disappointed to see my hungry niece's disappointment when she said, \"really, that's all I get!? Four shrimps!!??\" She dug under the over amount of fried rice to see if there were more underneath and there wasn't. I looked on yelp to see how much shrimp is in a regular plate and there's usually 8!!!  My niece shook her head and she said,\"I knew there was something up with that guy. That's so shady! If they ran out of shrimp, just call us and let me know or to make up for the missing four shrimp, add chicken and tell me. I would've been okay with that.\" Needless to say, she was done eating all the shrimp in a matter of seconds because she was hungry. She ate only a fourth of the fried rice.   Please know Island Flavor that my family and friends from out of town frequent your restaurant and make it a regular to visit your establishment. Be honest with your customers. A lot of the foodie picks on this page is from me and my family. Please don't do this to anyone again. There's too many Hawaiian restaurants to go to in Vegas for us to frequent and you know with the coconut-wireless, bad news spreads real fast. I'm embarrassed by this action to late night patrons   #noaloha",

It's really sad being from Hawaii and people ruin Hawaiian food. The only decent thing still is the furikake chicken. Please do better it's not that hard to flavor the food. I sent back the poke sampler because the fish was sitting on a whole deep fried avocado so the poke was hot and nasty there was more avacado than poke smh hopefully the bad reviews help the new owners.",

When we received our food it was cold and the lady (manager?assistant?) insists that its not when were the one eating it! There's 5 of us eating and 4 of us our food was cold. Maybe ill come back here to order to go next time but not dine in!  She also said it take 30mins for the food to be ready. Uhhh yeah if you guys are actually busy! It took ours about 40mins to get ours!   The steak we got was overcooked!!(which I will be uploading a picture) overcooked & cold.   They keep getting good reviews for the sake of 10% off discount which Im sure Yelp wouldn't allow.",

The restaurant looks like it underwent an episode of hells kitchen: everything is new, modern, and more spacious! The look is just simply amazing!  Let's talk about the food. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted because there was so many things to choose from! Chicken katsu to kbbq beef, heck I wanted it all so I got the Monstah plate which entailed 3 proteins and sides. I opted for the chicken furukake, teriyaki beef, and the kbbq short ribs! If I had to rank it: furukake chicken over  kbbq short ribs over teriyaki beef. All were delicious to say the least and pairing them with rice and mac salad... a must!  If you want to try island style food with great customer service and a modern ambiance, definitely check out this spot to hit up!",

We tried out one of their specials, the furikake chicken and we also tried their oxtail soup. The furikake chicken is BOMB! They give you a hefty serving. This was enough to feed two people honestly! The chicken was flavorful and crispy. It paired well with the rice and their specialty Hawaiian hot sauces. My personal favorite was the red one. The oxtail soup was pretty bland. I love the oxtail soup at California hotel and the ones they had at the Orleans. They're always full of flavor, this one, not so much. They give you a fairly large serving and plenty of oxtail pieces to munch on. Other than the bland flavor of the broth, everything else about it was good. The oxtail pieces were tender and delicious. Only docking one star for that. Service was great!   I recommend the furikake chicken. I will definitely be back to try their poke!",

My husband and I now plan our Vegas trips from Southern California to always include a meal st Island Flavor.  They have expanded and redecorated, and it is beautiful!  The food is amazing and the portions are huge.  Definitely the most authentic Hawaiian food I've had on the mainland.  Our last trip to Vegas was inspired by wanting to eat at Island FlavorZ.

    "text": "I feel like it could have been better.  The food tastes like they really care about what they make, but every bite of every dish tasted like it wsa missing something.   Our server and all the staff we encountered were really nice. They checked up on us regularly to make sure everything was going well or if we needed anything. Things started to go downhill when my dish wasn't ordered or was delivered to another table. We figured since (1) my husband got his entree before mine and (2) the server appologized and went back to the kitchen and told them he needed the dish expedited.   I ordered Friday's Daily Special. You can choose between Lau Lau or Kalua Pig with Lomi Salmon and Haupia. I chose the Kalua Pig. The flaor was not entirely distributed throughout the pork. I could taste that they marinated it with a sweet sauce but the rest of the pork was super bland and the cabbage was too undercooked for my liking. It would have been bomb if they sauted it a bit and added Hawaiian Salt or Shoyu when cooking the pork with the cabbage to give it some more flavor in every bite. The Lomi... literally, it had barely ANY salmon and it was mainly just tomatoes. The flavor was great but it really needed more salmon! The ratio of how I'm used to Lomi Salmon to tomatoes is like 2:1. The Haupia was the final straw. I took a bite and was shocked at how thick and super pudding like it was. If you ever had the Filipino dessert Maja Blanca. That was its consistency. I'm either very picky because I love the NOH Instant Haupia mix and how it's a bit thin, like jell-o. I really was not happy when we left.   My husband had the Tinono Pork Belly, and he wasn't too happy about his dish either. I tried it and it was super bland also.   I think the only thing I really liked was their Mac Salad. The flavor is perfect!  Would I come back? I would come back here if they changed up their recepies.",

    "text": "Needing some Island Flavor? This place is my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in the valley so far and I love that it is minutes from where I live. Island Flavor is a nice sit down restaurant, unlike most Hawaiian restaurants in town that are counter service. The hostesses and servers are also friendly whether you do a to-go order or sit down for a meal.  I have actually done both to-go and sit down meals here. As for a to-go, it might be better to call ahead. If not, you may wait a bit because everything is cooked at that time which really is a good thing because you know that your take-away is freshly cooked.   As for the Good Stuff aka The Food, there are so many delicious choices. I personally like the Spam Misubi and the Kalbi. If you like ground beef patties with gravy, they do an awesome one here. The brown gravy is pretty bomb and loaded with onions! Sometimes I have gone with double vegetables for my sides if I didn't want a lot of carbs and they are happy to do that.  So many delicious choices! Like I said, I am glad to have found such a great Island restaurant in my hood! Mahalo!",

I ordered 2 mixed plates to go this time around to try their barbecue and took a few bites on each plates and noticed the beef on chopped steak is rare, furikake chicken is coated with blood because of the rare steak, and kalbi was rare to medium rare. I have never received rare meats from any Hawaiian spots in Vegas and this would be my first. I am very disappointed with the quality of the food and unhappy with the money I spent in this restaurant.",

The Mac salad was good. My complaint ain't about the food though. I was there tonight around 6:30pm. The owner Allie introduced herself to all tables on the left side of the room but our table. She then proceeded to one table on the right side of the room to greet people from California. Skipped our table like we were invisible. Why, cause I'm brown? Or because we locals from Hawaii so you don't need to introduce yourself and be fake to ask us to come back. 1 star only for our waitress from Hawaii, Shazette who was attentive and showed her Aloha. No worry strawberry cause Zippy's coming soon to the Southwest! Take lessons from them.",

First of all we waited a ridiculous amount of time just to get seated.  Once seated our server Tyler was not very welcoming or attentive to our needs.  We waited about an hour for our food.  No apologies for the wait nor did he keep us updated on why we had to wait so long.  A table next to us got up and walked out due to his attitude.  All in all the food is good but the service was unheard of.  Tyler is so opposite of what a good server should be.  Please do yourself a favor and hire good people to represent your restaurant with \"ALOHA\". Will definitely rethink about returning",

Some salt fixed that problem.The mac salad wasn't that good. The macaroni seemed to be a bit more on the aldente side rather than the softer side. The Furikake chicken was Good! Very tasty. It's fried and then tossed in their special glaze sauce.   I wouldn't cross this place off my list just yet. I wanna go back and give it another try.",

On the plates: oxtail soup, furakaki chicken, kalbi short ribs with a side of bomb ass macaroni. Dessert called for freshly baked banana bread pudding.  This maybe my first check in however I am far from being a nube! As a regular I highly recommend the oxtail soup every visit! Hats off to the chef! The meat is always tender and the soup is a burst of ginger and beef broth flavor. The other must have dish is the spicy, avocado ahi poke. Somehow I feel compelled to say it makes a statement! I've tried the poke around town and nothing compares. It has the right amount of piscine taste and the avocado gives it the right creamy freshness. The furakaki chicken is a burst of flavor at your first crunchy bite and as you get to the chicken; it is tender and moist. The kalbi ribs are a tasty cocktail of salty, spicy and uuuumaaami!!!   Last but not to say the least, dessert!!! This is my first time ordering the banana bread pudding; it was fresh out of the oven, topped with cinnamon cream pudding. I love how moist the bread was and the banana was not over powering. What a late night delight.   I never dread the bill because the serving size is plentiful and the service is above par.   I always leave with my belly full and an upside down frown.",

The server recommended it furikake style but since we were getting the furikake chicken, I didn't want to overload on that particular flavor. For a half pound of poke, it was only 7.95 which I thought was such a great deal. The sauce was really good but not too overpowering.   We did the two meat special and got the furikake chicken and the roast pork, both of which were really good. The furikake chicken is crispy and sweet. I was hoping that it would be a little more salty but I still enjoyed it. We also got the macaroni salad as a side and it helped cut the richness of the meats.   We couldn't bear to not get the kalbi. My boyfriend left only the bones. The portion was huge and the meat tender and sweet.",

It is easy to find in Durango, not too far from Silverton Casino and Hotel.  The place was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  I could see from the orders coming out that the portions are huge!  Make sure you go hungry! I ordered the teriyaki beef and Korean chicken mix and the chicken was outstanding!  The teri beef was tender and flavorful.  Others in the group ordered, chicken katsu, kal bi, and teriyaki chicken. Each one that came out was piled on the plate and seemed to please all my friend's palates.  Most of the plates were priced below $10. If your a Las Vegas resident, you could take the leftovers home for lunch the next day.  If your visiting, you might want to share your plate with someone in your party unless you KNOW you can finish it.  If you share, you might have a little room left for dessert, which looked and sounded good, but none of us had any room for it.",

One plate could feed three of us had we known they were going to be so big. Kahlua pork is mild, but super tender. I could've used a bit more salt on the meat, but it was still good. Sweet and sour pork ribs were tasty but almost a little too salty. Furikake chicken was bomb. I added Sriracha and it became super bomb.  My only complaints are regarding the rice. Brown rice - too much water so I basically had two scoops of brown rice mush. Fried rice - now this is where I think Island Flavor failed because their version of fried rice is basically white rice with some lapcherng and veggies doused with soy sauce. I've eaten and seen fried rice made enough to know we weren't eating fried rice. The portion was a potful. No joke.  COCO PUFFS = yum. I have no idea what the buttery yellow stuff is on top of the chocolate cream puff but it's ONO. Mud pie = good. I liked the chocolate cacao or coffee nibs in the kona coffee ice cream. Really nice touch. Could do without the flavored syrups on the plate though.  Staff were friendly even though very busy.  Spam musubi was right on. Reminded me of all the musubis we've eaten in Hawaii.",

    "text": "We drove from the North end to the Southwest on this cold and rainy night. Did I mention we had to drive in fog. Big deal, right? Well yeah if your night vision sucks, and you've NEVER had to drive in fog, ever...in your life.  For a Tuesday night and all the rain...I was so surprise to see how full the restaurant was. It was busy. We were quickly greeted by Mark, who then became our waiter for the evening. He was such a delight to have. My son spilled water and he literally did not lose his delightful vibe as he was cleaning it up. I felt so bad. I give Mark 5 stars for his professionalism and welcoming feeling.  Tonight between us all, we had  ordered the furikake poke, kalbi, kalua pig and cabbage, opakapaka misoyaki, chopped steak and onions, and the furikake chicken. When you get the furikake chicken...your eyeball will fall out its sockets because of the portion. I saw that thing from afar and was so shocked. More so, this plate was for my 6 and 2 year old son...and it could easily have fed me as well. Note for next time. I gave it a bite and definitely loved the crispy chicken and the glaze used over it. The furikake was definitely evident.  My husband had the opakapaka (pink snapper) and of course he loved it! The misoyaki sauce used over the fish was light, and had a sweet taste to it...it paired well with the fish. I can't tell you much about the chopped steak my 8 year old had, because he literally devoured it...literally. Since I had ordered the kalbi and kalua pig combo, but really cared for the kalbi...I shared my kalua with the hubby. Kalua pig was legit.  Then there I was, with the kalbi I had tried the first time we visited. The one that I said was missing that island flavor I was looking for. Okay, well...Kalbi came out with a vengeance because tonight's kalbi was exactly the flavor with the char I was looking for the first time around. It did NOT disappoint.   Seeing the place a second time around....I say they have a better menu selection wise than 808MP. They offer fried poke, and I slapped myself for not ordering that tonight, but I came for the kalbi. So you know what that means...I will officially be returning. They serve BIG portions and it is definitely worth it for the price you pay. I can officially up the star it deserves.  Highly recommend if you are craving Hawaiian food.",

Admittedly at least 'familiar' with some of the styles comprising the genre, a number of Asian influences  noted amidst fried and roast meats with rich sauces rarely lacking in salt, it was just moments after 5:15 that I entered the sparsely decorated space and with the room half-filled by a mix of ethnicities that included several island natives it would not be long before drinks were filled and menus were navigated, a three-course feast soon to follow as  light mid-tempo music echoed from speakers overhead.  Well trained in service, the majority of the staff clearly longtime employees of the restaurant and happy to answer questions related to portions as well as preparation, it was with a duo of cultural staples that the sampling of Island Flavors began, and although neither would have been a preferred order if dining on my own both the snappy tuna and  Spam Musubi proved mostly what was anticipated, the former loaded with umami while the later, perhaps fortunately, saw the saline pork product mostly lost within the roll of warm rice.   Warned that portions run large despite costs that hover around $10 per plate, it was onward to three entrees that the evening progressed, and although the fried shrimp were a bit overcooked while the chicken was mostly flavorless without sauce, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in either the smoky shortrib or tender kalua pig, an equally well cooked piece of pork found strewn amidst rice beneath two sunny-side eggs and a rich brown gravy that, on its own, could have likely served a family of four.  Leaving at least four cups of rice behind, along with a few bites of macaroni salad that was actually quite enjoyable with plenty of creaminess packed in each bite, it was with an \"all-in\" approach that sweets were ordered up, and despite warnings and raised eyebrows from more than one staff-member the finale to follow was almost entirely worth the indulgence, the $5.50 Mud Pie a bit of a disappointment due to gritty ice cream while each cake from nearby Andrea's was presented at a bargain $5 per large slice, the faintly coconut Haupia not unlike something one might find at a wedding while the chantilly and guava came across sweet yet balanced, the quivering bread pudding taking a far less subtle approach with each banana-packed spoonful making a strong case for best in the city, or at the very least a good reason to come back.  Purporting no expertise in Hawaiian cuisine, but hoping to learn more in the coming months and years, Island Flavor represents a tremendous bargain to those looking for something familiar yet different with service and setting far superior to most eateries broadly grouped as 'ethnic,' the desserts a particular strong point even if they are mostly outsourced.",

    "text": "I don't particularly enjoy writing negative reviews, especially for a place that I once loved and highly recommended.   Because we absolutely loved their kalbi short ribs, we decided to order a party tray from them. (1/2 pan size kalbi short ribs = $80) Imagine my disappointment when several of the short ribs were blackened, as in burned. They sat on the bottom of the tray and went unnoticed for awhile. We were wondering why our guests weren't eating them and that's when we saw the unsightly pieces. My mom went to the restaurant later on that week to let them know. They took down our phone number and said they would call us to talk about it. No one called. A few months later, my mom returned and went in to talk to them and again was told someone would call us to talk about it. We were told that usually the owner would have checked out our order before it went out, but on that particular day, she came in after we picked up the order. Therefore, she never saw the order go out.  Again, no call from them.  Because I was so disappointed with that experience, the food and the lack of customer service, I decided to just not eat there anymore.  After almost a year of protesting, we finally decided to order food from there again. I initially tried ordering Pork Lau Lau on a Friday, but was told they didn't have any. I ended up with the combo Kalbi short ribs and furikake shrimp. My short ribs were blackened again! However, the Husband's order of short ribs were just fine. Also, the shrimp just didn't taste that great anymore. My Mom always orders the oxtail soup and always comments on how fatty their version is. You can see chunks of fat on theirs that probably should have been trimmed a little. (I'm all down for a little fat, but theirs is just too much.)  Their tuna poke salad, both raw or cooked, was pretty damn good...especially the dressing. But it's since doubled in price and not really worth it anymore.   Overall, I'm pretty sad that Island Flavor isn't in our repertoire of food choices these days. Quality and service had just gone down since they first opened and I get a sour taste in my mouth when I think of them now. With their current 4.5 star rating on Yelp, they won't be hurting for business I'm sure.",

The meal isn't too big, but there were definitely many items that caught my eye. I ended up ordering the furikake chicken meal while the boyfriend got the combo of furikake chicken and hawaiian roast pork. Each entree came with two big scoops of rice and macaroni salad. I'm not a fan of macaroni salad, but the boyfriend definitely enjoyed his. The furikake chicken was definitely unlike anything I've ever tasted before. It had the sweetness of orange chicken with the flavoring of furikake seasoning. Both worked really well together and even after I was full, I could not stop picking at it. My only complaint would just be that some pieces were a bit too hard, which ended up scratching the whole roof of my mouth as I tried to eat them. But that's a small price to pay for delicious island flavor!  At the end, the portions were just so gigantic that I ended up having leftovers that made up another meal for dinner, which only made my day better. We ended up accidentally leaving a debit card at the restaurant, but the staff was very helpful in helping us find the card. The service overall was very friendly and I can't wait to come back sometime in the near future.",

Although it's way off the strip and out of the way for us tourists, we still find ourselves making a visit to this restaurant almost once every Vegas trip.  The Chicken Katsu Loco Moco is amazing. No other Hawaiian restaurant offers Loco Moco with Chicken, always traditional with the burger patty. The gravy is what sets Island Flavor's Loco Moco apart from everyone else's.. Grandma's secret recipe is the best! I suggest asking for the gravy on the side because they give you a lot where you can take the rest home and make a whole new breakfast with it!  The Furikake Ahi Poke was very fresh and well seasoned. It comes in a half or full order but the half was a pretty good amount as an appetizer for two. The Korean Chicken wings were very flavorful and crispy.. would be even better with a pint of beer. ;) The saimin was just okay, nothing special but still perfect for a cold day.  Great food, great restaurant.. owner talked about opening a location in LA. I'm sure that would make a lot of people very happy!",

She said it made her heart warm. AWWW! lol She said it's better than the oxtail from The California Hotel because the oxtail was all meat as opposed to The Cal's fatty oxtail. I liked how they had bok choy in their soup. Not something I've seen in other oxtails. Def adds to the specialty side of Island Flavors soup.  The workers all loved my mom and kept asking her if she liked the soup. lol Idk what it is about my mom; whenever we go to these fam local style spots, they always wanna make sure my mom is good. Which is great....adds to the family style establishment they got going here =)  Add this to another \"MOTHER TESTED, MOTHER APPROVED\" places my mom requires me to take her to in the future!",

If you like classic Hawaiian music, come on Fridays, they have live music. And because it's aloha friday, they have a Hawaiian plate, choice of laulau or kalua pig, served with lomi salmon, rice, mac salad, and haupia. I usually get the furikake chicken and kalbi. It's a good combo that always tastes great. All in all I enjoy this place, just wish the employees had more sense of urgency. Don't really like sitting in restaurant longer than I need too.",

All the employees were like auntys and uncles (Hawaii slang) and it was as if I was dining at some restaurant at home =]  I had a hard time choosing between chicken katsu and the katsu loco moco. They both sounded SOO SO OSOO OOSOOSOOO good! Not to mention the people around me were eating katsu loco mocos and I might have droooled a little...  But I stuck with ordering the plain katsu because I knew I wasnt going to be able to finish all of my food and so I thought it would be easier to save! Saving a katsu loco moco makes me think of soggy chicken katsu and Idk if I am really a fan of that.  Katsu was ON POINT. I love it when katsu is crispy and their katsu was just that! Omg and their macaroni salad was super delicious too. They have huge pieces of pepper and it really gave your mouth a little kick while eating it.. i enjoyed that. 2 scoops rice, a mound of katsu and 1 scoop mac salad for $9??? WIN. WIN. WIN.   They also give you a nice container of sauce. Im a sauce lover so I NEED lots of sauce :3  Plus the service was so friendly and wonderful! \"You need to eat half of your plate to get a take out box!\" *jokingly of course. But we laughed. I think all of us were a little beat up from clubbing and shennanigans from the night before so eating a large meal of meat and rice was not high up on the agenda before a 6 hour car ride to LA... Still delicious though and I am actually eating my leftovers as I type this!",

    "text": "Good Lord, another Hawaiian restaurant to review. Luckily, this is one of my new favorite ones in Vegas!  Some friends of mine suggested this place to my boyfriend and I literally RIGHT before we were leaving to Vegas. They had found this place through yelp one day and mentioned it. Thank goodness I'm always down to try ANY food.   This place is located in a plaza that's not hard to locate. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, and a little bigger than the other hawaiian restaurants I've been too. We were seated quickly upon arriving and the employees were all pretty friendly and attentive.   Most of the menu items looked amazing, but thanks to Yelp I narrowed it down to two dishes. To be honest I really wanted to try a little bit of everything. We ordered the Korean Chicken (chicken wings fried Korean style) and the Chicken Katsu Loco Moco. I instantly fell in love with the loco moco. I've never had it in this style before and the gravy that it was covered in wasn't too overpowering. I was told the gravy is homemade in the back by the owner's grandmother (I'm not exactly sure if this is True).   Upon leaving we talked to the owner and he had mentioned he was looking to open a location somewhere in LA. I really hope he does. Because I would absolutely come back. Which is what I plan on doing next time I go to Vegas.",

I've had oxtail soup at home, at casinos, at other Hawaiian eateries, but none of them were as good as the one here (sorry mom!). It came with four, big, meaty servings of oxtail per order. It also had vegetables to actually eat and not just as garnish. The order came with two whopping scoops of rice and macaroni salad. I honestly couldn't finish it all. For dessert the waitress recommended their new guava cake. At first I was a little apprehensive, but I finally gave in. Thank goodness I agreed on ordering the guava cake since it was THE BEST CAKE I've ever tasted ever!! It was moist and you can definitely taste the guava flavor. It was sweet but not overly too sweet. sigh. It was heavenly. I looked around to check up on other people's food and let me just tell you their servings are huge! This place takes their food seriously. I've tried my friends dish and it was packing with flavor, melt in your mouth goodness.

The food is served in good sized portions and you get a good bang for your buck. Easily now one of my favorite places to go to for Hawaiian food in town. I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "As everyone mentions - portions are really large. For the money, you're getting quite a bit of food. I loved the homey atmosphere and our waitress was very sweet & friendly.   Fried poke salad ($10.25) - I was feeling adventurous. I can't say I enjoyed this very much but I guess it's more just my weird tastes. So I love seared tuna and I imagined it'd be like this. The problem with poke is each piece is a different size so the cooking is really uneven. Some pieces were burnt and grey and dry, some were pink and pretty, some weren't cooked at all, etc. I should have realized this before I ordered but that's my loss !  Hawaiian mixed plate - we got this with double rice, kalbi short ribs and kahlua pork. My husband was so ecstatic - the first place we've found where you can get the pork with no cabbage mixed in! This was tasty but not as fatty and wonderful as the pork in Hawaii. The kalbi ribs were incredible, husband declared them best ever. Delicious!   We'll return - and we'll be getting a big ole platter of kalbi short ribs next time !",

The servers, as you would expect in all things Hawaiian, were really nice.  Food: I wanted to go for the gusto and got the Hawaiian plate: pork lau lau version.  The flavor was there, however, it lacked the moistness that stays in the lau lau when you personally take it out of the ti leaf.   Overall: I will definitely be back.  There's a lot of items on the menu that takes me back to the islands.  Good job!!!!",

They have a smaller menu than Zippys but everything they offer is 5 stars.  I've had the Roast pork, Furikake Chicken and the Loco Moco here with the Chantilly Cake.  This is easily one of the best Hawaiian restaurants in Las Vegas. The only issue is limited seating inside the restaurant, because it has become so popular with the Hawaiian transplants in Vegas, the wait could be 30-45 minutes for a table but the food is worth it.",

    "text": "I'm reviewing this place again because of the change in ownership. Having read some of the latest yelp reviews I've decided to eat at this place again really because I was craving my favorite dish from here, Hawaiian Roast Pork. I ordered the mixed plate, my two choices were the Furikake Chicken & Hawaiian Roast Pork, the other members of my party had 1) Loco Moco 2) Chicken Katsu 3) Furikake Chicken. For appetizers we had a full order of Poke Combo the types were 1) Hawaiian style 2) Furikake 3) Sesame Poke and two orders of Cucumber Kimchi. For dessert we had 1) Haupia Cake 2) Guava Cake 3) Coconut ice cream. These are all dishes we've eaten here many times before and we all agree they've remained the same. The amount of food was still the same. The prices to us were the same, reasonable, it's not like we looked at the prices and thought \"wow this is expensive\". The staff was the same, friendly and welcoming people we've been waited upon in the past. The place was going through an expansion process. Apparently they're going to knock out the wall to make the dining room bigger, which should help because this place gets really crowded. I just hope they also expand the kitchen too because more customers means you gonna need more cooks. So my take on the change in ownership is so far, everything is still the same, but how the new owners go from here is full of possibility. Still a five star and still the place recommended to anybody that asks me \"So since you're from Hawaii were is the best place to eat Hawaiian food in Las Vegas?\" I'll still say Island Flavor.",

I honestly went in with pretty high expectations because of all the hype built up by my friends and I was not disappointed. My friend and I shared the spam musubi, furikake chicken, and the hawaiian roast pork with gravy.  SPAM MUSUBI. WOW. Honestly one of the best musubi's I've ever had. Everyone talks about how it's so simple to make, but every time I've tried to make it isn't quite as good as ordering from a Hawaiian restaurant. The rice was perfectly cooked and the furikake in the middle was a nice, sweet touch.  FURIKAKE CHICKEN. Okay, the hype for this is definitely real. And I wish they had this in LA. It reminded me of orange chicken, but with a slightly sweeter sauce. The breading of the chicken was really crispy but the inside of the chicken incredibly tender. So. Bomb.  HAWAIIAN ROAST PORK. This was a bit eh for me. I love the gravy that Hawaiians enjoy topping on their meat and I was definitely not disappointed by the gravy. The pork was very soft and tender but it had way too much fat on it and was not that pleasant. It was also a little tooo peppery for my taste.  All in all though, I was pretty impressed by Island Flavor. Especially because of it's cheap price and huuuuge portions  Definitely will be coming by again!",

I left the food that was right so my kids could start eating and went back to the restaurant to get the missing poke.    I brought the wrong food back to the restaurant and they asked me whether or not I touched or ate the food- which I hadn't. Apparently they also gave me the wrong poke and asked me where it was at. The girl didn't want to give me the food I actually paid for unless I brought back the poke I \"took.\" The girl even asked me if we started eating the poke and if we could bring it back. I didn't want to argue with her and said just give me one of my poke so I can go.   I saw her take the food I had brought back, re-bag it up, and give it to the guy who came in asking for his takeout just a few minutes later.  I was completely disgusted.  I worked in a restaurant for over 10 years and repackaging food that may have been contaminated is a health code violation.  I won't be eating here again.",

Not to mention the absolutely savory gravy, so good that we got another order of just gravy that we used to coat the even better tasting porkchop that is seasoned to perfection!! All in all a great restaurant, amazing experience, and even better customer service! S/o to our server Kehau for making our first time at Island Flavor so enjoyable and nice! She didn't hesitate when she saw us raise our hand for more food and hot water and for being so nice and welcoming",

Kevin said the place is typically busy during the week, so I'm glad we easily found an empty table on the Sunday afternoon that we visited.  We decided on a half pound of ahi poke and an order of furikake shrimp. The waiter asked if we wanted a half or full pound of poke, and even though I had to resist, I'm glad we said half pound. It was plenty of food for two people. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp, but I could tell it was expertly made. The crispiness was on point. I also loved the freshness of the poke. Overall solid meal!",

    "text": "Ancient Hawaiians ventured away from the islands in great, double-hulled canoes as far back as 900 AD, in search of food, new land, and entertainment, exploring Asia and the west coast of North America. They may have also been homesick, sailing back to their roots in Marquesas and Tahiti.  Back in June 2017, I traveled on double-engine Airbus 330 with Hawaiian Airlines to California in search of food and umm--well--entertainment. After a few days, in sunny Orange County, I drove to Las Vegas to continue my quest. Using GPS like my descendants will, the four-hour sojourn was successful, narrowly avoiding a five-hour delay on the I-15 when an RV blew up a few vehicles in front of me. A week on the Continent and feeling homesick, I searched for Hawaiian food.  My first stop in Las Vegas: Island Flavor off of a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I had the roast pork with gravy, and was thoroughly impressed with the service and quality of food. Heaping scoops of steamed rice, fabulous macaroni salad, and roast pork crusted with black pepper and smothered in silky, brown gravy. It was also a great place to meet other people from Hawaii on vacation or relocated to Las Vegas. Oddly, this was the best and cheapest Hawaiian food I've had, including everything I've experienced back home in Hawaii. Their five stars will help me navigate back to this place.",

So lemme get to the good stuff first: their poke is spot on good; fresh and delicious. If you get their 1lbs option it's a pretty good deal and you can share with friends.  We also tried the slightly cooked poke option but to be honest, I didn't care too much for it. It just reminded me of teriyaki cooked fish, nothing really special.  My main course was the furikake chicken, portions were huge! It lasted me that meal and fed me the next day (but then again I don't like to waste food, so I'm a huge left overs kinda guy..) ha!  As for the disappointments though, the flavor of the chicken got boring quick, and the texture was way too tough and difficult to digest. The chicken was also a bit too dry, I think it was deep fried way too long. The sauce was a little too salty for my preference but if you want something to fill you up on a deal, I suppose you're getting your money's worth.   Island flavor is alright if you want quantity over quality, and some decent poke but I can't really see myself coming back here again unfortunately.",

    "text": "OK folks, I just want to let you know that this is not your fine dining, dress up kind of place.  This is where you will be asking for extra napkins, put on some shorts and flip flops and bring a large appetite for some good ole Hawaiian plate food / comfort food.  Stop it, don't count calories when you come here.  Fill up and exercise after...you nap off the great food.  When Island Flavor opened up in Henderson, the owner was telling me to come over to the regular restaurant on Durango.  Today for Grandma's birthday, we came here for lunch!  The place - What is it with all this development south of the 215 between Durango and Jones?  What a great deal of good food places coming from this area.  The parking - No problem in this nondescript strip mall.  Plenty of parking.  The place - This your basic table and chair dining room that is truly basic because it is made to be eatin and not to be fussin.  The menu - Wow,  Ahi Poke, Salads, Fish, Beef Stew, Opakapaka, Oxtail Soup, Chicken Katsu, Pork Chops, Kalbi, Korean Chicken, Rigs, Teriyaki Chicken or Beef, Musubi, Mac Salad, Tons of Rice.  This place is heaven for good ole plate food.  The food  Korean Chicken and Kalbi - This is the mixed plate I ordered and the Kalbi is just right. Yank the meat off the bone and it is all tender.  Not too much bristle and fat just and plenty of good ole flavor. One of the best.  The Korean Chicken is great. Fried and then a wet sauce is added to this that is so tasty with all its oriental flavors. I really enjoy this Korean Chicken. It is basically wings.  Love it.  Plump and juicy.  Korean Chicken and Teriyaki Steak - The wifey had this and the steak was melt in your mouth.  Loco Moco - Hawaiian breakfast over rice.  A huge bowl of goodness is what my son ordered. He can eat a lot but he only ate half as it was so big and he was saving his stomach for dessert.  Island Flavor Salad with Catch of the Day - The daughter ordered this and it was both huge, at least 12 ounces of fish, tons of sald, sweet potatoes and won ton strips. She was starving and could not finish this.  Oxtail Soup - Wow, the soup was good but the oxtails were like soaking in the soup and there was a lot of it.  Great taste, fall off the bone and a lot of it too!  Mudd Pie - Ummmm, that crust is the best ono thing I can ever imagine. Is it a crushed oreo that is made into a crust?  I don't know. It was a large piece of pie and the Kona Coffee ice cream was good but I did not eat most of it. I instead ate all the crust. That was so delish!  Chantilly Cake - An interesting cake that I cannot really tell you if it is good or bad as my mouth was full of that crust from the Mudd Pie.  Chocolate Ice Cream - The daughter was expecting a scoop and she got like a huge sundae shaped bowl full of chocolate goodness.  I did taste it and it was very good for sure!  This place is so good. It is fun, tasty and comfort food at its very best, if you like Hawaiian Plate Food.  GK says, check it out, and if not for the food, for the service because all the people here have the greatest service and make you feel like family!",

Once in, it is warm and inviting on this cold Vegas evening.  When we ordered, I was thinking along the lines of some of the Hawaiian places in San Diego.  The portions here are big!  The partner started with the Portugese bean soup...flavorful and hearty!  He thought the salad was coming on his teriyaki beef plate, but a large side salad appeared as well.  My mom  and I ordered the roast pork....a mound of pork covered in gravy with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I was in Hawaiian food heaven!  I also ordered the special fried noodles, and a large plate came out with char siu pork....very good!  My dad had the oxtail soup and really enjoyed it!    No wonder this place gets crowded because lots of locals were coming in.  I saw two desserts go out, and we ordered the banana bread pudding to go.  This came with a delicious vanilla sauce!  It's good to know there's another alternative to come to instead of eating at the California Hotel...LOL!  The staff was really friendly and our server told us that they've been open for seven years now.  I can't believe we didn't find this place sooner!  This place is legit!  Can't wait to come back!  If you're a haole and do not understand Hawaiian culture or food, please go eat at Jack-in-Box...I think there's one down the street...",

After 10 mins, we asked any waiter that was available that we are missing a meal. That same server kept looking back at us after checking, but never came back to follow up. They seemed to have avoided a mistake and did not want to own up to it. The order finally came out \"rushed\". With different management, you can tell it's missing the authentic \"Aloha\".

We also got shrimp and a couple musubi to take home.  Friendly staff,  appropriate music playing, order was quick.  My only suggestion was that they get low salt soy sauce.  We found the menu selection to be interesting and will definitely return to try more. My husband is from Hawaii and he was really happy. Saying the meat was the way his mother made it.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best Hawaiian food I have ever had (other than Hawaii of course).  Randomly came here on a friday night 30 mins before closing. Called in ahead of time and they offered to put our name down on the list. Awesome.  They have plenty of tables for small and large parties.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious and best part? ITS SUPER CHEAP!!!! Each plate is less than or around $10. And oh my lord, SOOOO MUCH FOOD!!!  Each plate can seriously be shared between two people. I opted for the combo plate because I wanted to try more than one thing.  Hawaiian Style Roast Pork & Furikake Shrimp Combo The pork is cooked local style w/Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped w/rich homemade brown gravy and the shrimp is jumbo shrimp coated with panko and furikake fried golden brown and served with oriental sauce. The pork was VERY tender with a nice ratio of meat to fat. And the shrimp was crunchy and delicious. I definitely recommend both options. I did ask for white rice, but the cook accidentally gave me fried rice instead, which was even better!!! Because it was a super large portion of fried rice and had bbq pork meat in it and a nice subtle flavor. The mac salad was the only thing that was a very small portion, but it was good as well.  We also shared the fresh made ahi poke. It was good as well. Especially with fresh sliced onions.  Overall, great service, great food, and great prices!!",

Hawaiian Food is probably one of my fav things to eat. we can sit here and talk about how good the place ism but I like to rate places  in comparison to others in the entire city. my favorite dish is kalua pork. the taste here is different from the others, not sure what it is, but it's like its cooked fresh everytime, one way you can tell is by looking at the cabbage, and its color.  Second kalbi ribs, amazing taste, I've had it at other places, and this is definitely a cut above the rest. great service, and they make you feel welcome. I don't work to far from the place, so its definitely a great place to go. They have so many other things that they don't serve at other hawaiian places or they're version is wayy better than others. it might just be me, but I definitely recommend anyone visiting vegas to try this place first for hawaiian before any other place",

    "text": "my parents and I decided to eat here because we love Hawaiian food. It wasn't our first time here, but tonight was the first time we were disappointed out of all the times we've eaten here... it's a Friday night, I was excited Bc there was live music which I always enjoy. my parents ordered the Aloha Friday special which is choice of pork lau lau or Kalua pig with rice, Mac salad, lomi lomi And Haupia... I ordered the Korean chicken, which was very good -- no complaints about that! However, the aloha Friday special was very disappointing.. Our server told us in advance that they ran out of lomi lomi and for both the Lau Lau and Kalua pig, it would be $7 extra and I told her that's fine.. Soo when we got the aloha Friday special plate, there was Lau Lau + Mac salad + rice and a bowl of Kalua pig on the side.. when we finished our plate, I asked the server if we're getting our Haupia and she said, \"oh, we ran out of that too.\" -__- my only reaction was \"WOW!\" all I could do was shake my head.. if she told me that both the lomi lomi and Haupia they ran out off, In advance, then We woulda ordered something else but server failed to mention all.. seriously though, you might as well have said that they were sold out of the aloha Friday special instead of serving half the plate.. I basically paid for a full entree, but only get 34 of the order.. That's crazy to me.. for the aloha Friday special, it cost me $18.75 ($11 for the lau Lau, rice, and Mac salad + $7.75 for the bowl of Kalua pig) that was NOT WORTH THE PRICE! Our server should've offered something to compensate what they ran out of OR discount the price of the plate!!! would you pay that much for 34 of what you ordered?! hell no! I will post a picture to reference this review and owners and workers of island flavor, please tell me if that aloha special plate was worth $18.75 Bc I can tell you and others I've shared this with can tell you it's not!!! and then you got the nerve to charge me full price?! Or not even offer anything to compensate for the lomi lomi and Haupia?! I'm not one to complain but that just made our experience tonight, a horrible one.. I still tipped, only 10% because the service could have been better.. Our server didn't even smile once to us or the table next to us.. and she didn't even check up on us, not once.. Island flavor should really take this into consideration.. You shouldn't be charging your customers full price and not give them the full order.. It's not fair.. I left a comment on the receipt as well.. so please take this as constrictive criticism.. the next time we eat here, I don't want to have another experience like this..",

Its not exactly Hawaii's plate lunch but nothing wrong with some reinterpretation for mainland taste (mashed potatoes as an option instead of rice, or chicken katsu with brown gravy; huh?)  The teri steak, teri chicken, and kalbi are just as good as any back home.  All are deeply marinated, lightly charred, cooked well done, and served messy over rice and mac salad. Win!  The Portuguese bean soup and oxtail soup are also both good but can't top the best back home.    The plates are large.   Prices are EXTREMELY high.  At around $10 per plate, its even more expensive than most Hawaii plate lunch restaurants.  Unfortunate since you can get so much more for your money elsewhere off the Strip.",

Well, not really slaughtered it-i have left overs as they give you the soup in two cups. It's only three oxtails in the soup, they're an overall healthy portion.

    "text": "No joke, some of the best food I have ever had in my entire life! Here's what I tried:  -spicy avocado poke: incredibly fresh! It's not spicy at all but it is very flavorful. I preferred this one over the furikake poke (they have 3 kinds of poke) -furikake poke: also incredibly fresh with much more complex flavors than the spicy avocado poke. This is 100% preference of tastes as one poke is not better than the other...it's just very different flavors. The furikake poke has more of a kick and spice to it but not spice as in hotness...more kind of like how pepper adds a certain heavy spice. I just prefer to taste the raw tuna and the furikake's seasonings are stronger than the spicy avocado tuna. Again, both delicious just your preference.  -fried rice: I only got this as a side but man are they generous! It comes as a pretty big pile and they even add pork and chicken in it which I didn't expect. I thought it would just be like Panda Express fried rice, lol. I love fried rice over steamed. Very good pick! -furikake chicken: one of the best things I have ever had in my entire life. Please skip all other chicken dishes and just do this one. The flavor and crispness is just...OMG unexplainable, lol. Don't read about it...just go eat it, lol. Words don't do it justice! It comes with a big pile of steamed rice and macaroni salad, like typical Hawaiian dishes.  Portions are very big, prices are fair, place is clean but very busy so come outside if their lunch and dinner rushes if you hate that. If not, just prepare for a mild wait.   The only tip I have for management if they read this review  is maybe to direct traffic a little better. There is a sign that says to wait to be seated so people come in and we all end up piling on top of each other by the front door blocking it to other customers coming in and out. After ten minutes of standing, we were all asked if we signed in. We didn't know we had to so about 3 families including us all went to the front desk to sign in. I'm fine with waiting but it is very disorganized. Maybe having a waiting area not right in front of the door and having the sign say to please sign in will avoid the messy traffic jam.  But, you will love this place. I cannot wait to go back!",

Then there's a heaping portion of chicken Katsu, the light brown gravy, and the egg on top.  I like the option of having the egg cooked how you like, although I'm sure a True hawaain may correct me on the style the egg should be cooked.  Everything was such good quality and although my mouth was willing, my stomache was not and I had to take half to go.  The service was super fast and super nice and I overall loved this place.

Tried to call in my order but apparently they don't accept cash orders for pick up over the phone anymore. Too hot outside for that. Uncomfortable place to wait for 20 mins when it's busy, especially for a salad (which they changed  on me:( . Also take musubis off the menu if you don't make them anymore, always just told they are out every time I order. Time to find a new spot, cutting too many corners now... 2 stars because staff was nice.",

Island Flavor was recommended by a colleague and I was game. It's a lot further away from most everything, but absolutely worth the drive. I hope you are hungry when you go, because they give you enough to feed one army and at a reasonable price. Loco Moco was broke da mouth! Will be back fo sho when I go come back to town!",

For some reason I thought this was a place where you would go up to the counter to order, but it is an actual sit down restaurant.  The place is a little dark, but I think they keep it that way to keep it cool and the shades are pulled to prevent the sun from blinding you.  Anyways service was friendly and the portion sizes are extremely generous here!   We ordered: -1/2 pound of Spicy Avocado Poke ($7.25) - tuna tasted fresh, the sauce they put on top had a nice kick to it, served with raw onions and wontons, the wontons underneath soaked up the shoyu sauce and was a little on the salty side, otherwise super good -Lau Lau Special ($11) - steamed pork served in taro leaf with 2 sides, we picked side of white rice, mac salad and it came with some type of coconut jello dessert, mac salad was solid, the pork itself was pretty good could be seasoned a little bit more though -Chicken Katsu ($9) - deep fried to perfection, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, came with side of mac salad and rice -Mixed Plate with Roast Pork and Kalbi Ribs ($11.25) - kalbi ribs cost $1 extra I believe, had the mixed salad with a tasty dressing as one side, added on fried rice for extra $2 as other side, both the roast pork and kalbi ribs were so flavorful! -Spam Musubi ($2) - they forgot to bring this out to us so we had to ask another worker to bring it, generous helping of rice inside, the seaweed didn't even wrap all the way around the musubi, regardless it was delicious   Will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for Hawaiian food with generous portion sizes!",

It's a medium size dinning area but it fills up fast.  I ordered a spam masubi to start. A decent sized masubi and flavorful. For my entree I did the combo platter with the Kalbi and Furiake chicken. I definitely made the right choices. Kalbi was some of the best I had in Vegas and Furiake was crisp and flavorful. The plate comes with rice and Mac salad. I upgraded to pork fried rice. They give you a hefty portion so I had enough for a filling lunch the next day. Can't wait to go back and try some more of their selections.",

The kailua had just right amount of saltiness, moist, juicy, and hand picked/shredded. The thing enjoy about this version at Island Flavor is the cabbage not julienne cut so dig in get best of both worlds kailua and cabbage. Or hell if want cabbage in one bite then kailua all you. Again not emphasis portion size got love LOCAL food best deal under ten bucks lunch or dinner.   I tried the banana bread pudding. Honestly ok. I never really got any hint of banana in the bread pudding and not as dense. That just my personnel preference. Now the haupia cake still reigns supreme out of the desserts had at Island Flavor.   One thing forget mention is only local style they have heat warmer that keeps spam musubi wrapped individual portion ready too go. Like pay the bill and take some spam musubi for late night snack or munchie. Yay!!!!!",

Furikake shrimp and loved it. Shoyu poke and loved it. But today's special was hoisin baby back ribs and it was out of this world. Meat was falling off the bone. I really enjoyed this plate. I'm def calling ahead of time just for these ribs. I hope they put it on the menu cuz it made my day for sure.  I made the mistake last time and ordered way to much food. I ordered poke for appetizer last time and I could of ate that for my meal by itself it was huge.   Service is always great, place is always packed cuz the food portions are huge and tasty.",

They were not cheap about how much fish they give. I have never ever gotten full off of poke where I couldn't finish. Good job!  I also tried their kalbi ribs and it was delicious.   Service was nice and they were always there to fill up our drinks.  My cousin made an order difficult in my opinion and they got it right with a smile on their face.   Everything about this place screams HAWAII !   Whenever I come back to Vegas I will be sure to stop by here again.  I recommend their poke and their kalbi ribs",

Nine of us came through and ordered a lot of things off the menu, some from our own fat desires and some from the staff suggestions.  Hoisin Glazed Ribs - Good but a little extra saucy. The ribs fell off the bone and is great with the rice. Ahi Poke - Probably the best part of the meal. Order the big big portion and share. If you talk to the staff nicely, they'd be willing to give you portions of each kind they have. My favorite was the shoyu or sesame. Light in flavor but not completely lackluster. Kalbi Short Ribs - The flavor is akin to many of the korean style ribs but a little sweet. Hawaiin Style Pork Roast - Great tender pork. Hands down some good flavor. Loco Moco - It was Hawaiian food and we felt obligated to order this. Would we do it again, maybe but I'd have to reduce how much we ordered. I think since we ordered so much food, I wasn't able to enjoy this meal as much as I'd have liked.  I may have found my far off the strip place to eat. Damn good and worth the drive away from the craziness of the strip.",

Prices are Very Reasonable & There is Plenty of Parking!   The One Thing that Made Me Sway More Toward this Eatery is Because they had My Chantilly Cake, Which I Could Not Find Anywhere in Nevada!

Shoyu chicken is the Thursday special and its a sweet type of adobo that tastes great. The Kalbi short ribs are thick and VERY delicious.

She was at another table holding a customers baby, laughing and chatting with them but as soon as she went back to the counter, her aloha spirit was gone. She didn't greet us or the other customers when we went in or thank us when we left.",

I had this bookmarked in Yelp for awhile.   When walking into Island Flavor, I felt like I was on vacation! Well, I was already on vacation anyway. I meant to stay vacationing on the big island of Hawaii. The restaurant wasn't busy and accommodated our group of five guys easily. Since I was the only one who wasn't craving spam and eggs, I went for my next best choice. The Chicken katsu loco moco.  The menu offerings looked so tasty, but I wanted to stick with the egg themed entree' at our table. When I got my loco moco, I felt like I was in a eating competition. The bowl that my meal was served in was huge! I had  generous portions of chicken katsu and rice. I didn't want to use the gravy, so I opted it on the side and get the katsu sauce instead. The chicken katsu was nice and crispy from the breading, yet tender inside with the chicken. The egg was a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg.  Mixing the yolk with the white rice is always the best!  The staff here were very helpful and attentive. If your ever in Vegas and craving some authentic Hawaiian food, check out Island Flavor and give them a try!",

    "text": "Not even going to lie, this place isn't close to the strip. If you don't have your own ride, don't bother. You'll spend more for the cab ride then the food itself. However, if you dig that island grind brah, have your own means of transportation, and don't mind driving out southwest of the strip then this is a good spot to try.  We had some peeps meet us up in Vegas from that cold country to the north of us. They requested \"Hawaiian\" and after some research, Island Flavor was the chosen spot. Most people would've probably said to hit up the Cal hotel in downtown LV, but since I've been there before, I figured a new spot would be more interesting.  Heidi our server was funny and very friendly. She had that legit Hawaiian accent and looked like she can beat me to a pulp if I acted up on her. She suggested the sesame poke to share. A full order is a whopping $18 so we went with the half order for $9. The tuna was surprisingly fresh, the sauce was perfect, and the block cuts of fish were generous. There was enough to share between four people. The full order would've been overkill. I've never found a place that served decent poke except when on the Hawaiian Islands. I think Island Flavor proved me that good poke can exist on the mainland.   The entrees here are no joke ginormous. I had the katsu chicken loco moco. I mean, talk about a heart attack waiting to happen. Fried, battered chicken, over rice, TWO egg cooked the way you prefer it, topped with this thick and rich gravy sauce that dominates the entire bowl. I worked half way into it and instantly ran into a wall. It wasn't even a subtle build up to getting full, it was as if my brain told me, \"Stop now, you're done.\" By no means was this a negative thing. The katsu loco moco gets an applaud by my standards and if you can conquer this beast of a dish, I give you mad props. It can easily be shared between two people.  Got to sample some other goodies from my company like the Korean bbq short ribs, macaroni salad, omelet Portuguese sausage fried rice. All were tasty but every ounce of my concentration was zeroed on my katsu loco moco. In the end, man lost, food won. Togo boxes please. On a side note, we ate the left over cold the following day and it was fine.  Overall, this was a pretty good spot. I'd recommend this little Hawaiian joint for those of you willing to drive a little away from the strip and try something different then fancy hotel food. The prices were decent and the service was great. There definitely was an authentic island taste here. Be ready and bring your Polynesian sized appetite because you're going to need it. Only downfall was that they don't serve musubi!",

They even had a live band on Friday night I think. Anyway, they played my in law's favorites including I Miss You My Hawai'i. The lady was pretty good I guess, for she left him and the better half misty eyed. I was gnawing on my food but she had a pleasant voice for sure.  We ordered a bunch of items including kalbi, loco moco, and Kalua pig of course. We also ordered the coconut dessert which is white and gelatinous, served cold. I think it's called oompia? I can never remember the names properly and am pretty ignorant of customs and pronunciation. The first time I went to Hawai'i I thought they were all pretty rude bc they kept sticking their fingers at me driving down the road giving me the Shaka. I am not a fan of the 1 finger salute normally. J/K BTW. It was delicious. I am not a sweets eating person and I enjoyed it.  Don't get this place mixed up with Island Style on Sahara. The last time I ate there to satisfy my Kalua pork craving before a big entrance exam, it was pretty food courtish. The pork was overly done as in sitting under a heat lamp kind of overdone. Flavor was just lacking. Indigestion in bed was complimentary. They give you peanuts at that place but the unwelcomed flies that were fighting me for my food made it less than memorable. You do Kung fu chopsticks with the fly on one hand while trying to eat with the other. This kind of callanetics I don't need. Rest assured you need not worry about them here. The place is very clean.",

    "text": "When this place first opened, I used to drive all the way from Green Valley just to come here - I was addicted to the amazing haupia cake (freshly baked at the bakery next door). The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway...   I've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch.   The owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake.   They're also open a little later and  7 days a week now. Not sure if they still close for about a month around xmas/new years though.",

They serve up some good Kalbi and I love the Saimin.  You can't go wrong with either the Chantilly or the Haupia cakes.  The only weak point, for me, is the Kalua Pua'a.

We tried Guava cake for dessert, thinking it might be too exotic for us but we were feeling adventurous (and they were out of everything else).

The restaurant is very family friendly, complete with many kids running about. The vibe is very friendly and warm. This style of food is a bit heavy to say the least, and I won't be able to do this weekly, but I am already planning what to eat on my next visit. Hopefully soon.",

    "text": "Its probably a lucky thing for me that this place is on the opposite side of town, because otherwise I might live here. I spent 20 years in Hawai'i, and I know my Hawaiian BBQ, and this is as good as the best I've had in Hawai'i and by far the best outside of it.  The portions are heavy, they use great quality cuts of meat (not like the fatty gristly cheap stuff you too often find), and they serve with Aloha. My absolute favorite is the beef teriyaki steak which is always perfectly done. My girlfriend loves the fried poke salad, which I often share with her, and is truly great. If you're able to manage dessert after eating all of that, the Guava cake is definitely worth trying.   Now aside from being the best Hawaiian BBQ in town, they truly live Aloha. I wont give all the details other than to say that yesterday I went there, and despite a bad situation (which had nothing to do with the restaurant) the management showed me an act of kindness that blew my mind. I cannot recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "I cannot believe that such a place that serves delicious food is brought to one star due to horrible service. I always get the Ahi Poke with a scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. It's very good, but on September 25 approximately 3:15pm, their credit card system was down. I had called in advance to place my order since I was not going to dine in. When I told the younger lady if I needed to pay with cash since the front of the door had a sign that said \"cash only\", she said yes. I informed her that I was not told that on the phone. She then proceeded on telling me that I could go to the gas station nearby and use their ATM ..I said no it's going to charge me, I'm not doing that.   The whole time she did not apologize at the fact that I drove far and they didn't tell me it was cash only at that time . She then said, \"I'll try\" with an attitude. The card went through. She got the receipt for me to print and after I signed it she went to get the food, brought it back, and walked away. The whole time no \"here you go\" \"thank you\" \"I apologize\" nothing.   Sad thing is that I would go very often and witnessed so many other issues. One day a group of three ordered their food and it took forever and they purposely left the food intact as soon as it arrived and left.   The first time I went, they took 30 minutes to serve us and it was the wrong order.   I really wanted to give it a shot because of their food, but trust me, some of the people that work there will not smile or serve you well unless you are Hawaiian.   Also, be careful when you order ahi poke, they don't tell you they have an option of half a pound. They will always give you the full pound.  I would suggest you pass this place unless you like rude customer service and long waits.",

I didn't find the kalbi as tasty or tender as other reviewers, found it tough and short on marinade time. Haupia cake not recommended, should have tried the ice cream pie. Our companions liked their furikake shrimp and the kahlua pig with cabbage. This place definitely is worth a visit, I just didn't order the right thing this time.",

    "text": "Finally tried Island Flavor for the first time today.  Been hearing only positive comments and recommendations for this SW Hawaiian eatery in a relatively undeveloped part of town, and the experience lived up to expectations.  The portions are way more than generous.  Sides?  They can serve you a \"side\", but it will still be entree portion.  Just about everyone who dines here, leaves the restaurant with the tomorrow's lunch pre-packed.  The desserts are just as big as the big island, and the ones I tried (Banana Bread Pudding) was delicious.  I tried the mixed plate with the Kalbi Ribs and Hawaiian Style Roasted Pork (serve with gravy), plus the Ahi Poke (Shoyu) and sampled the sesame and furikake ones as well.  I personally really enjoyed the sesame ahi poke. But I think the Poke Salad (entree sized salad) also looks very delicious, and I will most likely try that in one of my future visits.  Besides the good food, the price is reasonable. You are definitely not going to leave this restaurant feeling like you can have a Big Mac Combo.  It is perfect for a family or hungry & growing teenager, football team, etc.    It is perfect for anyone that wants good food, generous portions for a reasonable price!  The friendly service is added to the package for absolutely no additional charge.  Are you an ahi poke fan? This is the best value and taste for the money in all of Las Vegas.  Sesame flavor is probably the best, but everyone's preference is different, so try them all (just not all at one time, unless you have an army to help you finish it). No joke!  Food:  4/5   Some misses, but most are hits. Definitely worth the drive to this part of town if you are in the mood for Hawaiian food \"local\" style.  Portion:  5/5  How many different ways can you say the portion is huge?  Each plate is enough to share for two regular people.  Service:  4/5  Friendly service.   Location:  Can be a long trek for some, considering the location, but I think it is worth it.  If you are visiting from out of town, unless you have your own transportation, I would suggest passing this one up (trying to get a cab out here back to the Strip would be a hassle and costly).  Price:  5/5  For the portion, it is definitely worth it.  Ambiance:  4/5  Hawaiian inspired art works adorned the walls, but I didn't pay it much attention when I saw the plates of food at the pick-up window.  Easily a solid 4 stars!",

The place was about half full and we noticed it was a bit bigger than last time. Apparently, the shop adjacent is now gone and has made way for more space in the restaurant area. My mom had just had surgery up the street and wanted to come here. She had the Hawaiian Roast Pork and it was amazingly soft! Maybe not rich in flavor (but bland), but perfect for what she needed! I had the Chef's Loco Moco and this was the best loco moco I've ever tasted. Born and raised in Hawaii, and they make it better here (where they put pork belly in with the beef patty). Absolutely delicious! The food came quickly and we were checked on while we were eating. When we were done eating, we were given boxes for our food and our check. Prices are reasonable for yummy items that we don't need to travel to Hawaii for, but $14 for a loco moco....? Other than that, everything was amazing. Decor is very aesthetically pleasing, comfy, and not falling apart. They keep it very clean! Service was cordial.",

Just give me a bowl of that Hoisin and a spoon. The ribs were so tender, like they'd been marinating for years. The sticky rice and mac salad sides were excellent. Huge portions. What a plate.   Furikake Shrimp - Crunchy. Perfectly cooked. Delicious, tangy dipping sauce.  Dessert: Coconut Pineapple Ice Cream - We didn't think we had any room left, but figured why not? We received a heaping, refreshing bowl and finished the whole thing. A really nice surprise to close out an already transcendant meal. The real coconut chunks really sealed the deal for me.

    "text": "Been quite a while since we last ate at this place and now what dramatic changes hit you in the eye when you walk in.  I like the changes but was the food and service altered for improvement also?  NO!  We waited 50 minutes for our food when I told the wife we could have gone somewhere else and gotten way better service.  New menu but same food sort off, some things taken off and the price increased.  Now you gotta pay for toss salad when it was free if you didn't want the mac salad and it's now 1/4 the size of what use to be.  OMG.       Love the Hostess, we've known her for years and she is always a friendly and vibrant person, but the so called chefs or cooks--must have been hired from the slow boat from china cause they are so super slow.       Portion have been shrunk down some and they must be using a smaller rice and mac scooper because not enough rice and mac (way smaller portions). If they were in a five star restaurant (and they NOT) they would have been fired a long time ago.       Why does this place have an Executive Chef who cannot produce only do book work..not a good idea.  Still got foreign cooks which is ok just like the Chinese and Japanese places, cheapo labor I guess.       Changing the decor and menu but not improving on the service is bad for business.  All the old timers are now gone so we gotta wait and see if this place will live up to its reputation of long ago.  I personally will not be back but its up to the public to choose their own path.        Looking for another great Hawaiian home style cooking place, not many left here in the valley...to many impostors.  I am Island Born so I cannot be fooled into seeing and made to think it's HAWAIIAN when it's not.  Where's the ALOHA gone to?",

Ordered the Mixed Plate: Furikake Chicken + Terikyaki Beef Steak that came with 2 scoops of white rice and 1 scoop of macaroni salad. Added a side of \"tossed vegetables\" (yellow squash, carrots, onions, zucchini) so I could feel better about myself. Unsweetened ice tea was also very good! $16 to-go order.   Staff was super friendly. They knew who I was the second I walked through the door. Food was delicious! 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate in North LV might still have my heart for the furikake chicken. However, I live and work much closer to this one so I can't wait to try everything on the menu! Will definitely be back.",

Especially the Haole guy upfront who needs to be either trained on how to multi-task or simply just get replaced. This location and restaurant is by far one of the best Hawaiian spots on Da' 9th isle, but since change of ownership, service upfront has gone downhill. If you are the new owner reading this, please retrain or replace your front person that greets, takes to go orders and cashes people out. Cause he clearly can't multi-task well. I've seen people walk out many times and have heard many complaints that their orders weren't placed and they had to wait an additional 20 mins for their food. Which happened to me right after he did this to another customer. Anyways, if any of you are reading this, this place has Ono'Grindz, but you gotta wait like 20-30 mins sometimes to get your food.

ONE Star for the GREAT customer service. From the minute you walk in to the second you walk out. They are very welcoming and very friendly. They sure show the Aloha spirit.   ONE star for the delicious food. OMG!!!! I ordered the kalbi ribs and it was sooooooo freakin good. The meat was well flavored and juicy. The fried rice with Portuguese sausage is a hit as well. I totally recommend these two dishes.     ONE star for the deserts. The coco puffs are my favorite. I mean it's not like the in Hawaii BUT it's pretty close to it. I can't leave here and not enjoy deserts. Their guava & Chantilly cake is delicious as well.   ONE star for the Poke. Man o Man... tasted so fresh and Ono!!!! I can just eat this over and over. You have to make sure you get at least  1/2 a pound... better yet, you'll regret it, get a full pound  you'll thank me later.   ONE star for the humongous portion. Soooooooooo much to eat but I'm not complaining. Take it home, and eat it later for left overs. I did and it was still yummy!   Add up all my stars and I give Island Flavor 5 STARS!!! I RECOMMENT THIS HAWAIIAN RESTAURANT. TRUST ME, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.",

I guess because they wanted to go home already. I did ask before Bringing my family into the restaurant if it was okay to eat (3:45 and they close at 4).. miss the aloha spirit there. Doesn't feel aloha at all, except for one Aunty (i didn't get her name) our hamburger in the loco Moco was nasty. Hard like cardboard.  Ordered all of our drinks at once and had to wait about 10 minutes before she got the water (usually the first to come out) won't be going back.

Hands down the best island food I had in the mainland.  The disappointing part of this is that I bought my leftover food home and as my daughter and I were eating our left over, my daughter notice something blue on top of my Furikaki Chicken, she stopped me from eating and says, mom there's something on ur chicken, she grabbed the blue piece out and said that's gross. She stretched it and said I think it's a piece of gloves from who-ever made your food. I was annoyed. I called and a man answers the phone, I asked him if this was the island flavor by the gas station?, and he answered yes, I then asked if they used gloves? He answered yes. I went on to ask what color was the gloves, and he answered blue and I see everyone wearing it, which is good. They all have gloves on.  I told him about what had happened and what I found, and I told him I can take a picture of it -and send it. He says, I don't know how can I receive that picture, I don't have technology to get that picture I asked him if I could speak to the manager and he says that he the manager can't talk to me right now cause he's the cook, and if he has to take my call then he has to put a hold on everyone else's order, I was annoyed but the way this guys was talking. He did say in a sarcastic way that the manager said to bring it back and he will make me a new plate or I can get a refund. I thought this guy was rude and he needed some customer service training, btw his name is Tai or Thai. And I suggest if here or anywhere always check ur food.",

Two plates, $30 total including tip.  The food was ok, portion sizes were smaller than before but still ok.  It tasted ok but to be honest I left the restaurant mad and ashamed.  I noticed that they had issues of the current Kama'aina magazine which was always free to customers, a great resource for local businesses in Las Vegas to support.  I grabbed one copy and was scolded by the cashier who said they were only for dine in guests only.  His tone was crappy made me feel like I was stealing, there was a sticker which said one per table.  One copy for a customer who paid for his meal and he treated me like a thief.  I will be subscribing so that I won't have to go through that same again but will not be returning any time soon.",

    "text": "What you need to know:  - My sister used to live in Las Vegas and this was always the one restaurant that I always had to visit  - Island Flavor comes from the lovely Big Island, with a couple of locations still there  - Live Hawaiian music on Friday and Saturdays from 6-8:30pm - this is the time frame when the restaurant gets packed, but it creates the best atmosphere! - Leilani, our server, is the veteran waiter and has been at Island Flavor since the beginning.  She showers you with authentic and joyful aloha - she made us feel like family!   - If you're on Yelp's cash back program, this restaurant offers 10% cash back! ;)  - In short:  Delicious Hawaiian food, fantastic service, live music - perfect!   What we ordered:  - Kalbi short ribs price $11.50 - A full order comes with four delicately smoky, sweet, perfectly cooked ribs (not overcooked, still a tad pink on the inside).  Just get it! All plates come with choice of starch (white rice, brown rice or French fries) and choice of mac salad, sauteed veggies or salad.    - Mixed plate of Korean fried chicken and Kalua pork with cabbage $11.50 - Leilani, our lovely waitress, suggested we try the mixed plate, where you can try more options.  The Korean fried chicken was probably my favorite thing we ordered - extra crispy on the outside, sweet with rich glaze and incredibly juicy on the inside!  The mixed plate portion of the Kalua pork with cabbage was simply perfect.  - Opakapaka cooked misoyaki style $15.95 - The misoyaki style is a wonderful way of cooking the opakapaka - the fish retains moisture and the misoyaki sauce is a mixture of savory and a tad sweet.  The opaka was a little on the dry side though. We ordered this dish with the fried rice, $2 extra, but it was definitely worth it!  Soft sticky rice, with generous chucks of pork, it was very moist and savory.  - Spicy Avo Poke - I refuse to eat poke on the mainland, but when Leilani suggested it, I trusted her and I'm glad we tried it!  Huge cubes of firm ahi mixed with avocado, crispy wonton crisps and drizzled with a spicy mayo sauce.  It was actually very very good for mainland poke!  - Kona coffee mud pie - $5.50 - By the time we finished our dinner, I was stuffed beyond the comfortable level but my friends powered through and got the Kona coffee mud pie.  I only got a bite of the deep rich Kona coffee and dark graham cookie crust.  Let's just say they had no problems finishing it even though we were so stuffed!",

    "text": "The furikake chicken happens to be one of the most popular entrees there, but it's not exactly my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but I just don't see myself eating it every time I visit Island Flavor. Also, it's not really that good as leftovers which is a bit of a disappointment.   On the other hand, I do like the teriyaki chicken, Korean BBQ, and the teriyaki beef. It's so flavorful to the taste that you just want more. Also, the portion sizes are so big that you're sitting here thinking you should probably save the rest for later. With that said, the prices are just right for them.   Often, I get a to-go order because they're quick and I avoid the rush which is fantastic because sometimes it can get so busy there. Not ideal when you're famished.   Overall, I would recommend this place for the taste of their entree, price, and portions.",

You can order a single entree or create your own mixed plate combination for a couple extra bucks.  Entrees are served with 2 scoops rice and 1 scoop mac salad.  Sounds like plate lunch time!  On our first visit, the server recommended the Kalbi and Furikaki chicken.  I decided on a combo of Furikake chicken and Kalua pork and cabbage.  The chicken was crispy and coated with a sweet glaze and Furikake.  The Kulua pork was a bit disappointing.  I didn't think it had enough smoke flavoring.  Hubby had oxtail soup.  The soup was very tasty although a little heavy on ginger.  Portions were very generous!  On our second visit I went with our server's recommendation.  Kalbi ribs and Furikake chicken.  Tummy was very happy.  A small complaint was that one piece was a little grisly.  Don't feel that's the restaurants fault.  The Kalbi was seasoned perfectly.  Hubby ordered the Lau Lau special which is served with Lomi Lomi and Haupia.  Very ONO!  Don't forget to save room for a piece of Chantilly cake",

I wasn't very impressed with their food at all but I thought it was because it was more of a fast food restaurant. I read all the great reviews about Island Flavor and was anxious to give it a shot. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is pretty friendly. I ordered the Hawaiian Special which was LauLau with a side of fried rice, macaroni salad, some fish and tomatoes, and a creamy white dessert.   LauLau is tender BBQ'd pork served in some type of edible leaf. I was told the leaves were edible so I cut it all up and added the house bbq sauce. The leaf was very bitter and odd tasting. It completely ruined the flavor of EVERYTHING else that was in my mouth so I moved as much of it aside as I could. After that, the meal wasn't horrible, but it didn't really impress me either. My friend ordered the saimin which is a bowl of ramen in broth and sprinkled with egg, imitation seafood and vegetables. He told me the broth was incredibly bland. Needless to say, I don't think that we will be keeping this place on our list of incredible places to eat.",

I ordered the roast pork & kalbi combo with the gravy on the side. The kalbi ribs were some of the best I've tried! It was thick and flavorful. Juicy and not dry at all. The Mac salad though, had way to much pepper in it. The roasted pork had little flavor and the gravy wasn't that appealing either. I probably would not order the pork again. My bro in law ordered the kalbi ribs and chicken katsu combo. He let me try some katsu and it was good. Nice crunch but moist inside. Pretty darn good.

I did the mixed plate with Chicken Katsu and Roast Pork.  What was cool was I asked if they can do fried brown rice and they did, so they're very accommodating.    You really can't beat the amount of food you get for the price.  I think my total came to $13 and I had to take it home, so it basically fed me for two meals.  The portion of fried rice alone was the size of a full order of fried rice you'd get from a Chinese restaurant.",

Can I just tell you right now that if you like gravy, then you're going to order chicken katsu loco moco. It's crazy good! (You can get el pollo loco after if you want).   Dude, seriously, it's in a bowl! And the bowl is bigger than your stomach!! A heaping of golden chicken katsu on top of perfect (jasmine?) white steamed rice. And to top all off... An explosion of gravy everywhere.. In a bowl! I also forgot to mention, two eggs cooked in any style you want.. In a bowl! Not a plate.. A massive bowl. Like eating cereal for dinner (+5000 more calories) I prefer over easy.. So you split the yolk and mix it with the gravy and it's like a super special moment, nah mean?   Aunty, the waitress, recommend you try da half kalbi short ribs half furikake chicken, brah! Broke da mout! (Which it think translates to hella bomb!!) and I try em wat Aunty say n I tell her .. \"Oooh Aunty, it's onolicious!\"   By the way, if you think you can finish it all in one sitting, you're going to hell cause you're a liar! You can't. You're not supposed to. You get a box and you take 'em home braddah!  Btw, on aloha Fridays, try the lau lau. & if you have room for dessert, dare you to get the kona coffee mud pie! Good thing 85% of the time it's aloha Friday on Fridays 100% of the time!",

After a flight from SFO, we are super hungry. We ordered the stuff below:  Furikake ahi poke...ah good stuff. Came out a bit on the cold side, but the flavor on them cubes were on point. Not so powerful, but just right. Onions, hawaiian salt, fresh cracked pepper, and some oil  Chicken katsu... good but not great. Average taste, on the dry side. But still good when you're hungry.  Furikake chicken...dang! broke da mouth dis one. Geez, so tasty and flavorful and Im sure oh so bad for you but whatever. I'm in it for the taste. Love this dish.  Kalua cabbage...it's good, but the pork that I got was more on the fatty side. I like mines with lean pork. But it was still good, and not overly salty like some other places.   Fried rice....also good, but not great. But I also compare fried rice to my faves at Side Street Inn and Big City Diner in Hawaii.  All in all, this place is really good. Come here for good food. And although we were way too full to eat their dessert, their haupia cake looked friggin amazing.",

Now you may ask what happen to get the rating right? Well the service and the fact that they basically told me in so many words that the spam masubi that they sold if it wasn't in that little oven in the front then that means there are no more? What kind of place does that though? And an hour before you are closing? I could see if I walked in 10 minutes before you are closing but is that spam masubi that hard to make that you couldn't request one or two more to be made? Yikes! Not good service in my eyes especially when somebody is trying it out for the first time. It's simple things like that, that would steer me away from ever coming back.  My dish I ordered was like a two item combo and I selected the chicken katsu and the Furakaki chicken with double mac salad instead of the rice. No complaints on that! No whether I'll be back or not is in the air but for now...",

Can't even taste the flavor due to over cooked. No sesame seeds, no nothing! I was really disappointed. I ended up throwing both food always which costs me  at least 16$. It was so bad. Don't go here, they rush your food. And the place looks so ghetto and small. Tables and chairs, decor so outdated. Considering they charge too much for their food and they seem busy at times.

Unfortunately all food was a total disappointment.   Furikake Chicken: WAY TOO sweet. Too much batter. Couldn't eat more than 3 pieces.  Furikake shrimp: Overcooked, dry, salty. Ate only one piece  Kalbi short rib: ALL BURNT! After cutting out burnt parts, not much meat left to eat. It was bland and lacked flavor, but I thought bland is rather better than too sweet or salty..   Chicken katsu: Dry and not so crispy. Katsu dipping sauce is too thick and salty.   Spam musubi: I didn't try so no comment on food but when my husband ordered, he had asked if they have teriyaki musubi as that is our son's favorite. They said they don't but they can give us teriyaki sauce on the side. My husband said ok and surprisingly, we were charged $1.75 for the teriyaki sauce. And btw the sauce was WAY TOO sweet and salty, even my 8 year old son didn't like it..   Plus this place is more expensive than other Hawaiian restaurants. I don't mind paying a dollar or two more per dish as long as food tastes good but too bad we didn't enjoy any dish. =(",

As soon as we walked in there was live music playing and pau already we decided to stay to eat. The family playing music had me in tears and their beautiful voices and music made me miss my island home.  So my hubby had the saimin, my son had beef stew and I got the Loco Moco. The place was pretty packed but our food came out pretty quick and yes everything was absolutely delicious and portions were huge! Truly worth the drive and the money we spent. And all the people there from beginning to end was so friendly and polite. Would definitely recommend to anybody wanting local kine food and atmosphere and a perfect place where the aloha spirit is alive and well! I know where we going hit up again next time we come visit. Island Flavor you rock!! Mahalo for a wonderful time. A hui hou kakou mekealoha pumehana! The Ninete Family from Nebraska.",

The last time coming here was very irritating.  It was the last time we came here.  Never again.  I placed an order online, Yelp, and came to pick up 1 hour later.  They were super busy, when my husband walked in to pick up our food.  He came out and said our order wasn't ready.  Then we waited another 15 minutes outside and then I went in and asked what the hell is going on with our order?  I spoke to the manager to figure out where our order was and he was an a-hole.  He said I ordered off another app, they didn't see my order.  They DIDN'T start my order yet or even try to accommodate us.  He said they're busy.  They deserve a zero star for that.  We didn't pick up any food...you can imagine how irritated I was.  I had to call the app to cancel my order I paid them for already to get my refund.  We came here 3 other times before this incident.  I would say the food is amazing.  Only one time the service was great...the other two times...it was frustrating to flag down someone to take our order.  They don't do well when it's busy and no one looks around to help customers.   Won't be coming back here.",

The ambience of the newly renovated restaurant has lost its welcome feeling. Besides the Hawaiian music playing in the background It still feels cold and empty.  We have been going to this restaurant for many years (since the day it opened) and the portion size was amazing in the past. Lately, we have waited for 45 minutes to get our food only to see that the portion size has decreased tremendously. This has all started since the new management took over. But what's most important is respect. The Hawaiian community is very tight here in Las Vegas and word travels fast. The fact that this new management (Caucasian owners) has disrespected our younger Hawaiian generation who has worked there for years and are amazing children, fired for no reason by a text message & another by yelling in front of customers, I for one will NEVER support this restaurant again. To label Hawaiian people as \"you people\" is one thing but to yell at an 18 year old girl who did nothing to deserve the disrespect you gave her in front of a restaurant filled with customers by saying \"get the fuck out\" is beyond me. That is low and of no class. I was always a loyal customer and overlooked the potion size, and the cold feeling I received in this restaurant, but the disrespect this new owner has shown to what she calls us as, \"Us People\", and the children of Hawaii, they will never be receiving my business nor my Ohana's business again.",

    "text": "I think the first time we came here was back in 2011, shortly after we moved to Vegas. Ordered the Kalua Pork and thought it was horrible. To be fair, it's been a constant struggle to find good Kalua Pork in Vegas. The only thing I enjoyed was the Kona Coffee Mudd Pie, which was shared between four people since the slices are huge! Never came back for years, until very recently.   About two months ago, we ate dinner here with friends and the restaurant was very busy. I think we waited at least 90 minutes to get a table. But the wait was worth it because the food was delicious! I ordered the Furikake Chicken, which was very very good. Huge portions, wasn't too salty and they put the right amount of sauce on it. I think I also had enough leftovers for two meals! The Guava cake was awesome as well! I have had bland ones from other restaurants, which basically tasted like yellow cake with whipped cream. But this one had a good guava flavor. Service on this day was great too. Even though they were busy, the servers were attentive and refilled our drinks promptly. After that, I was like \"My bad, Island Flavor is pretty good.\"  Wrong! The husband and I were in the area last week, so we decided to eat dinner here. Everything was pretty horrible except for the Guava cake. They were not as busy on a weekday. I ordered the Furikake Chicken again, and it was not good. The chicken was lukewarm. Ewww. Did they even take time to cook it?? I felt like the chicken was made hours earlier and all they did was warm it up in the microwave, threw some sauce and furikake all over it and called it a day. Yuck! Even the brown rice was lukewarm and cooked with too much water! None of the servers refilled our waters. What happened??  So yeah.....maybe its just luck and it depends on who is working. I'm giving them 3 stars because I know their food and service can be really good. Sadly, its only on certain days.",

    "text": "Guys at Island Flavor: \"Oh, back again, huh?\"    Ummm, I totally Yelped this place a week before going to Vegas and came here twice in three days.  So I totally live for plate lunch.  Note that my profile's \"last meal on earth\" is Hawaiian plate lunch, and my home city is surprisingly short on Hawaiian restaurants. (So short the number is zero.) So I had to get a fix in! Or two or five.  The meals here are so big that it just hurts. There's a reason why 90% of the bouncers at XS are Samoan. They don't get that kind of mass needed to punch creepy misbehaving guys in clubs by eating salad. I've made 5 meals out of my 2.  This is the most legit Hawaiian food I have had in the lower 48. Everything is seasoned well and tastes sooo bombbbbb. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR.   Service - 5/5 All the waiters working here are legit! Either they got island accents or fake them like bosses. Love how genuinely nice they are. Service is not over-the-top or fake. Just nice people being nice and bringing me tasty things. (If you split a plate, don't forget to tip like you ordered two entrees! These guys won't make sheet otherwise!)  Food: Basic menu is on website, but they have a paper insert with daily specials. So if you're calling an order for take-out, ask them if what the specials of the day are! Also, the desserts aren't on the menu. They are listed on the table (see picture).   Aloha Friday: Come early so you can get a seat! This place is jam packed on Friday! They have the most amazing family come out and play bass, uke, and guitar while singing traditional Hawaiian music. I grew up on an island, and it felt like coming home. I didn't realize I was getting my soul healed while eating lau lau.  - Lau lau- 5/5 wrapped in delicious leaves, juicy, and the perfect saltiness when you eat it with rice! - Lomi salmon- 2/5 This was almost all tomato and no salmon :( I guess it counted as my vegetable of the day? - Mac Salad- the guy asked me \"Are you sure?\" when I said I was fine with the mac salad and white rice. Was he expecting me to sub a vegetable instead? Please, bee-atch. I'm not from California. - Kalbi ribs- 5/5 These are BOMB! Way thick slices and grilled with a nice caramelization on them! They don't skimp, and the pieces are super big!  - Furikake chicken- 5/5 Super crunchy exterior so that it stands up to the glaze and stays super crunchy. You know how Panda Express orange chicken gets all soft if it's been sitting there awhile? No flaccid chicken here, folks. - Haupia cake- 5/5 I used to work at a bakery on island, and we made haupia cake. Theirs here is even better. The cake itself is perfect density, and the flavor is dynamite. - Kona pie- 2/5 Ehhhh eat the haupia and guava cake instead! The coffee flavor isn't strong, and the other sauces they schlepp on the plate overpower any coffee taste.  I'm glad this place isn't in my home city. I'm not looking for employment as a Samoan bouncer at XS quite yet, which is what I would probably be if I lived in Vegas and continued eating here. Fill up on aloha spirit, leave happy, and then go take a nap.",

    "text": "A hidden spot serving up amazing Hawaiian food! My friends and I decided to stop here before the drive back to LA after our little impromptu trip to Vegas. The wait was over an hour, but that gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu and decide on what to order.   After being seated, we decided to start off by sharing the Tuna Poke Sampler, which consists of their furikake, shoyu, and sesame-marinated poke. I also ordered the Furikake Chicken for my main. Although the poke sampler was fresh and delicious, the different flavors all ended up tasty of soy sauce and got a bit salty after a while. The Furikake Chicken was great, sweet from the glaze but a little bit salty from the furikake mix, and tender inside and crunchy outside! However, it ended up just tasting sweet after eating it for a while aha.  My only gripe about this place was how understaffed it was. I do not know if it is family run or not, but they basically had two servers on the floor who were not able to fully service all the large parties that were there. A lot of the tables were left dirty for a while until a server had the time to clean it up. But besides that, everything else was great! Great prices for quality Hawaiian food. We all left in food comas, which was not great for the drive back to LA, but we were happy and content^__^ Definitely visiting again the next time I make a trip to Vegas!!",

Prices aren't the cheapest but Hawaiian food is never really cheap, portions were huge, and the food was good. Even the cake slice was huge. I think they get it from the cake store next door but it's still good.  This is my current favorite spot for a quick 'take me back' getaway.",

She had no smile, a blah attitude and just made me feel that I was an inconvenience to her.  What happened to the aloha spirit of Island Flavor?  I sure do miss the previous owners and all the local servers who were always there and always took the time to greet us and treated us with plenty of ALOHA.",

The first time we were not impressed at all. We felt like the portions got smaller and the overall vibe felt different. We decided to give it second chance, but it was worse than last time. It was very disorganized. Before someone would greet us and make sure to take our names down. Now their is no clear place to sign in. They were calling parties that had already been seated. When we finally sat down, our food didn't come for an hour. During this time our waitress was no where to be seen. It's just not the same",

I ordered the hamburger steak with white rice and macaroni salad. The hamburger meat cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Topped with onions and mushrooms and smothered in gravy.

I got a mixed plate, which I highly recommend because you can get 2 meats (or 3 for a larger mixed plate) and rice and it's a large portion. I got the Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Beef and my date got the chicken with Teriyaki Beef, substituting the stream rice for fried rice. Firstly, the portions were huge; neither of us were able to finish the plate. The chicken was amazing, had the right amount of sweetness to savory against the saltiness of the rice. The Teriyaki beef also had great flavors but the Kalbi beef took the cake is definitely worth the extra charge. It had great seasoning nice marbling and was very satisfying. We also got the Chantilly cake for dessert, which of course is also a must have and it was a great choice, not too sweet or too overpowering.  Between the two, our bill was $40 something which was worth nothing given the amount of food we had and we had left over. Definitely coming back to check out more of their local menu.",

I actually stopped in without knowing anything about this place and just went for lunch with my roommate Mason, who has been to Hawaii numerous times so I figured why not give it a try.  As a southerner I am fundamentally pre-programmed to like most of these dishes because they have the same principals of many southern dishes. Slow cooked pork, greens, rice, gravy, fried chicken steak, and a mayo heavy pasta salad as a nice foil to the abundance of savory flavors.  I had the pork lau lau combo which came with 2 scoops of rice a side of the ceviche style ahi poke salad and that coconut pudding that I could happily eat every day for the rest of my life. All of this was $10 and the portion was too much for me to finish and made for great leftovers the next day.  This place has the typical kitschy interior that you would expect with any small hawaiian joint. And the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with making suggestions based on my limited experience with the cuisine. Although this place is now a bit of a drive from me, and for anybody else who is not in the extreme SW, it is beyond worth the drive.  I would have to pass 3 different hawaiin places on my way to Island Flavor, and to those who have been there...you know why this makes total sense.",

    "text": "I often complain about the lack of good eats in the depths of SW Las Vegas.  Sure, we have a few decent spots on Rainbow but i feel like we deserve more place in my neighborhood.  I've probably eaten at about 8 different Hawaiian places in the vegas valley - I give my local place, Island Flavor, the GOLD !  First of all, the employees are great - great attitudes, great services and consistent food.  The space is pretty simple - i'm pleased that they recently remodeled the space that resulted in adding more table space.  I've been told by a couple of the employees they make more $$ on catering than the restaurant itself.  I've been in a few times while they've prepped the food for catering events - it's a sight to see !  Anyways, the food - large portions, very reasonable prices and good 'ol stick to the ribs style grub !  My personal favs ?  The pork loco moco ( awesome !! ), the korean ribs,  the mac salad,  i REALLY dig the gravy ! and most of desserts.  It' all good !!",

After a year, we decided to give this place another try since we were craving Hawaiian food.   I am SO HAPPY we came back! We ordered the Furikake Chicken which was so delicious and crispy and the Kalbi Short Ribs which had great grilled flavor. Portions are huge so come hungry or ready to share. Amongst three of us, we could only eat half of each entree so had to pack the rest. Definitely looking forward to those leftovers later.   If you've saved room for dessert, the Chantilly Cake is a must. Chocolate Chiffon cake with butterscotch frosting. Need I say more.   Service-so friendly and attentive-5 stars Food-very flavorful and huge portions-5 stars  We will be back!",

Last time we were greeted by an amazing hostess, they were busy but you'd never know it by the way she treated us. She was even our waiter, and answered many questions along with some awesome suggestions. The food and service was 5 star. However. Hate to say it but this time... Wow! Not a good Wow unfortunately. Not busy tonight we walked in and barely got a \"hi\" and led to our table. Menus dropped off and she left to Visit with the table next to us to a flurry of hugs and conversation. The waiter came by got our drinks order, have us time to order and delivered the food in 15 minutes tops. We all specified rice, but maybe didn't say rice ONLY NONE of us like macaroni salad. When we asked about a plate to shop it on to we got a sigh, but we're asked if we would rather have salad which was very nice and we took it. The waiter came over to say we didn't specify it. I said no problem it was taken care of. This was the lady time we saw him. All of us had no drinks, I asked the hostess for some refills during her other conversations and was rushed of, saying be right with you. Witter came back no talking took the drinks filed them up and walked away.  Not sure what happened but the good was still very good, but the service alone may keep me from returning. Ashame people can ruin an experience. Maybe we will try again at another date....maybe",

Now, I don't come here to eat spam, eggs, and rice because anyone can cook that at home. It's like buying cereal at a restaurant.  Nevertheless,  I will always be a fan of the Hoison glazed ribs! The Korean chicken, fried chicken, and katsu are also good too. But if there is something worth drooling for here, it is certainly the ribs. It is more pricey than everything else on the menu but the portions of this dish will make you feel every penny of that $14 you spend here.",

I ordered the Chicken Furikake. The kitchen staff, working like a well oiled machine, got my order out in less than 10 minutes. The cashier, still friendly and still helpful bagged me up and got me out the door.   I'm moving more than 20 minutes away from Island Flavor in a few days. I will be driving back just to give them my business and to enjoy their wonderful food.   Highly recommend this gem.",

The customer service is always good, the food portions are good, and the taste is delicious. The furikake chicken, kalua pork and cabbage, and katsu are probably my favorites. The last time I went I had the Teriyaki beef which was good, but too much sweet teriyaki sauce! Oh but the other sauces, they have tons of different hot sauces that are all consistently delicious!   You also get the option of subbing rice for brown rice, fried rice, or mac salad. Usually I go with the mac salad and brown rice combo which is amazing. Their Spam musubis are good too and they are known for their avocado fries. I think theyre ok, not worth the hefty price in my humble opinion, but my 'mates swear by em!",

    "text": "[SERVICE] Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the store was really busy, they also seemed really understaffed and the whole store was chaotic. Other than the issues with a slightly slower service due to such a large amount of customers, the servers were really kind and friendly; the host may come off a bit rude but it's probably because there were so many customers coming in at once. Overall, I really enjoyed the service from my server, I forgot her name but she was really nice.  [PARKING] Located inside a plaza so there was plenty of parking, shouldn't be an issue!  [FOOD] Portion sizes were huge and the food was pretty good. For the price you're paying, I thought the quality and portion was definitely worth it. The only issue is that I believe they messed up my order because I ordered the chicken katsu but got the furikake chicken instead. It was fine, I didn't want to wait an additional 45 minutes for my food to come out. We got the Monstah Plate and its definitely enough food to share for 2 people in my opinion.  [TLDR] Try to come at an off hour or not the weekend, can get super busy; the service and kitchen will probably get backed up.",

    "text": "Long time supporter of this restaurant from the original owners from the Big Island.  Been coming here for the past 7 years and although the renovations and expansion of the space is great, I have to say the service has gone down since the new owners took over.    Today, the service was absolutely terrible.  Saturday's have typically been busy but Owner needs to staff accordingly as they were slammed and didn't look like they were able to handle the demand.  Customers look either irritated, felt sorry for the staff or both.    Our waitress Lei was apologetic but definitely needs a lot of improvement when it comes to hospitality.  She didn't ask if we needed anything or any refills on our drinks the entire time until we asked for the check.  It took over 40 min after we ordered to get our food served.  After she brought my wife and kids plates out, she told me she's just waiting on my food to be done.  My plate literally after she said that was put on the counter by the cooks.  I watched my dish sit on the counter for over 15 min before it was brought to me cold.  Lei, my server not only looked at my plate but touched it 5X and my wife and I sat their shaking our heads why she wasn't bringing out my dish to me!  I finally got up and told her that my dish has been sitting there for quite some time.  They offered to remake my dish but to wait and additional 20-30 min to bring it out, no thank you.  What's even more laughable is she said she'll give me a 10% discount on my meal.  In my opinion, that meal should have been comped.  Lei, did apologize but definitely did not come across sincere.  Due to time, I asked my daughter to give her our check along with our payment and my daughter said she was rude in saying to wait.  Not cool...  She was more than capable of accepting my payment since she was not carrying anything at the time.    When customers are growing impatient and having to assist in Bussing tables so that they can sit down and support your restaurant, there's something wrong here.  They shouldn't have to that or feel compelled to.  Where's the Manager or Owners?  I'm from Maui and I'm all about the Aloha Spirit.  There was none of that today....  they hired some locals from the islands but where's the Aloha guys???!!!    Compliments to the cooks as the food did taste good although my food was cold but that's not their fault.  There's a middle aged Hawaiian lady that has blonde hair, she was not in my section and she was hustling and doing a great job in my opinion.  Can't say anything good about the rest of the team.  The 2 stars are for cooks and the Hawaiian lady with blonde hair.  My overall comment on this experience is, if you like Hawaiian Plate Lunch food that taste good but don't mind getting it cold when it should be hot and don't mind bad service, come to Island Flavor.",

Ordered the monstah mix plate which comes with a choice of 3 meats, 3 scoops of rice and a side of mac salad. We tried the Kalbi short ribs, furikake shrimp and korean chicken (choice of drums or thighs). Kalbi short ribs have a great flavor but are very tough and not tender. Furikake shrimp comes in a panko style breading and deep fried. Korean chicken is boneless and fried. Shrimp and chicken were good but would probably opt for another option next time.   Also ordered a side of their Portuguese sausage which was really good in flavor. I love musubis which is a seaweed wrapper stuffed with rice and a choice of meat, as the only option they have is spam (sad face). Also sauces not included, $1 each. The teriyaki sauce is the best one, similar to a sweet and tangy eel sauce!  Service can be a little slow. Not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had, but it's a good try if you want something different off the strip.",

By the way, what is it about Vegas  and all these Hawaiian spots  and taquerias and ayce sushi and KBBQ spots and Pho . . .  man, there's hella places to eat in Vegas.  But I digress yet again  The food at Island Flavor has a freshness and love that puts the other Hawaiian places to shame.  Seriously, almost all items on the menu will satisfy.  I mean their food finds that fine balance between salt and sweet and spicy and savory.  And the portion sizes are quite generous.    I'm a fan of their Chicken katsu and Furikaki shrimp - what can I say, I'm a sucker for deep-fried deliciousness.  And don't even get me started on their desserts.  Overall, a must try when in Vegas.",

This weekend was the yearly Dodger basketball tournament and my fiancee and I knew that it would be busy coming here but we didn't mind. The food was pretty good and the service was okay. We waited 45 minutes for our food, but that was okay because we expected it.   Here's where the 2 star review comes in. We were first on the list to get a table and 2 other parties of 2 got seated after us, an elderly couple and 2 guys. The elderly couple complained about the wait twice and the server said she has to wait 15 minutes because we (my fiancee and I) ordered before them and our food was going to come out before theirs. They then asked for the check after 30 minutes of waiting. 5 minutes later, the server brought out their food. On top of that, the large table next to us got charged for things that they ordered and never received.  My problem is that the elderly couple next to us complained about their food and that's why they got theirs before ours. By doing this, you (the restaurant) are showing people that they can complain a lot and get what they want and I refuse to eat at an establishment that supports this. I gave a second star because the food wasn't bad and she comped us a to go refill of POG..",

(cuz that's what i do when i come to vegas lol).. my friends were hungry and we decided to pick up some food from island flavor. it was between this and thai and the pictures of the food won me over.   between the 7 of us we had 6 plates and the total was $62. i thought for a combination plate, $9.75 was a bit on the expensive side.. until i saw the portions. my mixed plate came with 3 pieces of short rib and at least 4 furikake shrimp.. possibly 5. i could have easily split my plate with someone.   the shrimp was the better of the two choices i had. not that the short ribs were bad... but i liked the unique flavor the furikake gave the shrimp. minus points for using mae ploy sauce as a dip for the shrimp. don't get me wrong.. i like mae ploy sweet chili sauce.. but i like it when restaurants take the opportunity to create their own awesome sauce instead of opting for pre-bottled stuff.   the mac salad was just okay IMO. i'm in love with L&L's mac salad i dont think its fair to take away points if i can't tear myself away from their version.   service was good over the phone when i ordered and very nice when we went in to pick up the order. it was all ready for us on the counter.  overall.. 3.5 stars.",

The ribs had great flavor but they were kind of fatty, though that is where the flavor is... The chicken teriyaki was moist, not too sweet nor too salty.  All of this was $13 and change plus tip.

It was ready a few minutes after I got there. Had the kalbi and haupia cake and they were both AMAZING. Fresh and delicious. The prices were pretty good and everyone there was super friendly and helpful. This is my new \"after work on a Saturday\" place to go.",

    "text": "THE INCIDENT I found Island Flavor by mistake one day while getting gas at the local Short Line Express.  It just so happens while I was at the pump, I miraculously look away from the ever-changing numbers of the digital LCD and see \"GRAND OPENING\" for a Hawaiian themed restaurant.   It must have been fate that I saw it or close enough for me to see since I'm near blind as a bat.  Hmm, Hawaiian sounded good to me that night...yummo!  So, since I paid for my gas w/my debit card, I trudged my rear end into the Short Line Express for a pack of cigs and to ask the store clerk if she thought the restaurant was any good.  In her thick Asian accent, \"Oh yes!  Vewwy goo!!!  Goo, goo.\"  Sho'nuff, she was right!!    THE PARKING LOT Because I'm lazy, I drive from the convenience store to Island Flavor, which is in the same parking lot, possibly 100 feet away.  HEY, they made cars for a reason!!!!!  Island Flavor is on the right side of a strip mall next to Short Line Express convenience store.  The strip mall also houses a dance studio, massage parlor, Familia Pizzeria (I just posted a review for this one), and some other small businesses.  If you are looking for an easy way to find it while driving, look for Bomas Bar & Grill.  Island Flavor is fairly new, in fact, I had to \"Add a Business\" on Yelp to review it.  When I got into the restaurant the server told me it just opened back in October 2008.  THE DECOR Anyways, once inside there wasn't much ambiance.  I think they're still trying to find their niche to whom they will identify with.  Though, the waitresses did wear floral blouses with dark trousers.  In the center of the restaurant sits a large square granite bar which looks like it was supposed to be a hibachi grill or regular bar.  There's no alcohol back there or any cooking utensils.  Who knows?  I only know this because I chose to sit up there while I waited for my (take out) food; I didn't want to disturb any of the waitresses' clean tables.  Around the bar, there sits about a dozen or so plain dining tables.    THE MENU Ahh...this is what you really want to read...They serve all of the traditional island fare from...ahi, burgers, chicken katsu, KALUA PIG, kalbi ribs, loco moco, mixed plates, saimin, teriyaki.  For my fellow SPAM lovers, I did NOT see musubi.  Maybe we have to ask?  Okay, so this is how I judge Hawaiian restaurants...kalua pig.  Theirs was EXCELLENT, BOMB SHIZZLE, FANeff'NTASTIC!  The downside...their prices are a tid bit higher ($1-2 more) than your other Hawaiian restaurants.  To me, it's still worth it.  I guess you figured out what I ordered for take out, Kalua Pig (no cabbage) w/rice and a side of brown gravy.  The total was $10.51 w/tax included.  THE HOURS TO COME BY Monday-Friday 11am-9pm Saturday           11am-8pm Sundays & Holidays Closed  THE CONCLUSION When we dine or get take out here again, I'll update this review to include more of their menu.  Support the locals, this place impressed me with their food.  Oh yeah, my bf who had my leftovers thought it was EXCELLENT, BOMB SHIZZLE, FANeff'NTASTIC as well!",

Both came with rice and mac salad or toss salad.  They didn' t have mashed potatoes or spam musubi when we went.  The ribs were delicious, but some of the ribs were mostly fat (4 in total) Hawaiian pork, huge portion, tender and with lots of gravy! Mac salad- I've had better but still good salad with papaya dressing - dressing was creamy and sweet, some of the salad looked wilted  cheap prices too $9 for each, def be back soon!",

There is no haole inspired terriyaki chicken with pineapple at this place..True katsu, authentic short ribs, home made mac salad..and the portion size arein True hawaiian tradition...I have eaten here over a dozen times and the place is familly run..so you feel like you are going to a bbq at an aunties house rather than a formal dining place..which is awesome for family dinners with a 4yr old..the ladies that work the night shifts call my daughter by name and treat her like their own little neice..letting her order herself and occasionally getting a free ice cream if she is a good girl The food here is not low-fat by any means..but if you want some amazing hawaiian comfort food here you go..this place is run laid-back island style..so go here to just cruise and relax not if your on a time schedule..this is not the place to get in and out for a quick bite..its a place to bring the whole ohana and talk story of some ono grinds...its a place to remember that a meal is a time to make memories and share family values while breaking bread..not a place to just feed your stomach when your hungry..i feel like I am back home in da islands everytime we come here  gotta try the short-ribs mixed plate ribeye steak korean chicken katsu dip and the chantilly cake..omg  nothing on this menu is small portioned or prepared wrong..you can tell the food is made with family love..so go enjoy some Aloha!!",

Looked soo good. I didn't order it but my friend had it and he was sitting across from me. I was waiting for him to offer but he never did and 15 minutes later not a trace remained. So, I assume it was good. I did try the oxtail soup which was full of tender oxtail, and vegetables. The broth was a little too salty for my taste buds but i enjoyed the large, tender oxtail pieces and how they just fell apart when I touched 'em with my spoon. I will definitely make this a pit stop before I had home to SD and you will not be disappointed if you are craving for that Island Flavor.",

    "text": "I've been going to Island Flavor for 5 years. It was my favorite restaurant. Recently, the owners sold to a group which has destroyed Island Flavor in the quest to make it more profitable. My favorite waitress-that-became-my-friend, Lei was let go, along with the original staff. The Big Island feel is gone. The new staff ignored us and didn't fill our \"lemon\" water often enough (we live in a desert), the lemon was 100% rind, the recipes for Furikake chicken and Hawaiian pork have changed to be much spicier, the costs went up, the walls are gray, there are some kind of rusted metal slats over the windows, and there's a whole bunch of TVs with sports games on them. It's like eating in a dark prison, with service that fits that setting. Sadly, Island Flavor is ruined. I'll miss the Hawaiians that made me feel like a family member there. And Lei, we will always miss you. -Kit and Amaris",

There is no Aloha spirit when you go there anymore your lucky if they acknowledge you with a smile! We recently ordered dinner to go and one thing that stuck out was their toss Salad! When we got home and opened it, it wasn't  a fresh salad. The lettuce was brown all around the edges throughout the whole salad, the tomato was cut into 3 pieces which looked like their eyes were closed when they cut it. I didn't bother to call them about and just not going back anymore.",

Pretty much the only concern I had was the heavy mayo like dressing for the salad and a couple of complaints of other Yelper's katsu and roasted pork being (and looking) pretty dry other than that, I don't mind heading back here again. 3.5 rounding up.",

It's big and hearty and the dressing is just sooo yummy. All the salads are the same.. lettuce, thick slices of tomato, cucumbers, okinawan sweet potato and topped off with won ton chips with the creamy sesame dressing and then you can either pick the teriyaki chicken (which I really like) grilled opakapaka, fried poke or the katsu. Anyone you pick, they are all good!! Another thing I really like is the roast pork.. Omg so tender and salty, just how I like it. I don't know why I never ate the roast pork loco moco before but it all just make sense!! Amazing!!!! I guess it just really big and I can't eat as much as I used to. Korean fried chicken is another one of my faves. Kalbi is also tasty and meaty. And if you like fish, try the opakapaka with the miso plate.. Soooo good!! I've tried their desserts before too.. Fantastic!! Try this place if you want some bomb ass local food from hawaii, you won't be disappointed.",

The photos on the wall don't appear to be the same kitchen pass through window.  I can see why this place has 200+ reviews and a high average.  This is no fluke. This is not 200 friends of restaurant yelp-up this place.  The food is just incredible and it's not that expensive.  I had the kalbi and slow cooked pork combo with a side salad.  I knew this was going to be good when the side salad rocked.  The freshest romaine lettuce I have ever seen in Vegas with fresh tomatoes, cucumber and a slice of bean cake.  A creamy sesame dressing with crispy wonton chips made a starter for what's to come.  The mac salad was very good.  The kalbi was tender on the outter region and nice and flavorful chewy near the bone.  You get 9 bones in this order.  The bbq is really good and has a slight char for more flavor.  The slow cooked pork was tender on the inside and chewy on the outside where the heat dries out the meat into a nice chewy texture. Not quite a chicharone texture, but almost.  The table next to me got the pokii and it looked fantastic.  I'm definitely coming back with my friends who are arriving to Vegas later.  This place is for real and the chef is doing things right.",

The tables and chairs are spaced moderately from each other so while your party is still granted some form of privacy it's still close enough to catch parts of the conversation going next to you. Normally I don't like to eavesdrop but here you can't help it. You hear stories about places back in the islands, memories growing up, uh-oh's from the party last night, grandma's funny joke, the usual gossip, and loud bursts of laughter just to name a few. Bottom line is, everyone is enjoying themselves and that's the atmosphere you would expect here. The menu has a good selection and if that's not enough, throw in a page of the day's specials and homemade desserts. The only bad part about this experience is trying to figure out what you want to order. Make sure you come with an appetite because the portions are huge! More power to you if you can throw it all back but I usually leave with enough leftovers to last for the rest of the day. No extra star only because it took a while before the food came but it was no one's fault. The place was busy and I was starving. (o.O)",

Like the server guy suggested, the portions were huge. We only finished half of what we ordered, but everything was just soooooo tasty (except the chicken. Many people seem to like it on yelp, but the meat is dry and to me it tastes similar to Panda Express orange chicken, so I don't recommend it).In addition to the two plates, we also ordered sesame poke, which was also very fresh very delicious.

We had Mini Chicken Katsu, Fried Rice, Furikake Panko Shrimp and a Kalbi & Roast Pork Combo!   Oh and they also serve local desserts (Coco Puffs, Guava Cake etc) AND they have live music on Friday nights!",

Weird, considering how much I love Hawaiian pizza ;) My boyfriend wanted to try this place out since it's close to our house and he used to live in Hawaii and was craving it. The place is super clean and the service is fast and friendly.   We ordered the Ahi tuna, furukake style. Not sure what the difference is in styles, but it came out with huge chunks of tuna, like 3/4 an inch cubed mixed with sliced white onions. It was very flavorful and fresh, but it was a tad bit salty IMO, but the bf loved it and said it was perfect. He ordered the kalua pig with cabbage, and I had a mixed plate with kalua pig and cabbage and katsu chicken. We also got a side of the kimchee cucumbers. The portions are huge, but the food is on point. I felt like the kalua pig could have used a little more salt, but everything was really good. We barely made dents in our plates and took a lot of left overs home, which were just as delicious heated up later on. I also got a spam musubi to go, and that was soooo yummy.   I'm really excited to go back and try more things!",

Comes with a large portion of fried rice with pieces of char siu mixed in, topped with an omelet of who knows how many eggs, and also thick slices of Portuguese sausage.  Kalbi short ribs mighty tasty and probably the thickest cuts of Kalbi here. Not the best for those who are dieting.  Shoyu ahi poke very tasty perfect on it own or with beer on a hot day while grilling.   Katsu loco moco, I know weird huh. I've seen it all over the place but never thought of trying a non-hamburger loco moco. I've been missing out its actually pretty good. I guess whenever I'm feeling like loco moco I'll order regular hamburger most times and every other time swap out for a non traditional loco moco.  Huge slice of Kona Coffee Mud pie and other cakes and desserts. If you still have room for this congratulations to you.  Just like their plates, their desserts are big and delicious.  Last but not least the Hawaiian plate which is only offered Fridays, is the best way to end the work week and to start the weekend. The only day of the week they have lau lau on the menu. It comes with two scopes of rice, lau lau, lomi lomi salmon, ahi poke, mac salad, and haupia. This is probably the best Hawaiian plate you can get in Vegas and it's getting so popular that they sometimes run out, from what I've heard, thankfully I haven't ran into that problem yet. Reason why I mentioned it last, I want mine LOL.",

I ordered the roasted pork with gravy, the Korean chicken wings, kalbi, and chicken katsu. The portions were large and easily sharable. All we're delicious, except next time I think I would just order the chicken wings and kalbi because they were my favorite, hands down. Even after all of that food, I managed to leave room for dessert and ordered the chantilly cake. Please get the chantilly cake. It was so light, moist, and will really change your life.

If you have not been here I suggest you get your butt up and go eat some great food! The Atmosphere is pretty laid back (which kind of reminds me a little of home) and the portions of the food will not disappoint you. Island Flavor will make a faithful customer out of you :D   The poke, I am left speechless! It was the most delectable thing to hit my taste buds! We have practically tried everything on the menu and my ultimate favorite is the Beef Teriyaki Steak. It is just drenched in just the right amount of flavor and the mac salad...don't even get me started on how delicious that is! (My mouth is watering)   I better stop reviewing because I'm getting quite hungry right now but if you are in desperate need for amazing Hawaiian food come here its no joke!",

Swear every time perfectly done, fresh taste.  Definitely one of my go-to's for poke and only place I trust for furikake chicken.  Just recently went in and sat down and got served by Sunshine, if I recall correctly and no doubt loved her service.  My meal was perfect again with my aforementioned meal consisting of said furikake chicken and a 1 pound of shoyu poke \"appetizer\".  Loved the crunchy, flavorful, perfectly seasoned chicken and both meals had a simple arrangement with a very flavorful and great tasting kick.  I have to thank Sunshine because when I originally ordered I had forgotten to ask for my mother's opakapaka to be broiled instead of sauteed... I asked her and she said her food was being plated, but that it would be no problem and they ended up remaking it which I greatly appreciated.  After my mother's surgery she'd been advised to cut down on oil and therefore broiled was the way to go.  And I have to tell you the aroma off the opakapaka was phenomenal.  I love my raw fish, but have to admit when that plate of broiled opakapaka came out, I wanted to to take it from my mom lol... I did end up tasting it and by far I can say it will be the onlyyyyyy cooked fish I would not mind eating here in the valley.  I'm not a cooked fish fan (whether it's fish tacos, fried fish, baked fish), but this definitely made me reconsider that choice.  All in all thanks to Sunshine and the other servers who were just kind and attentive, thanks to the cooks for such great fare.  Thank you Island Flavor for everything, definitely 5 stars!",

Bit on the too salty side but was good and cold, just right.  The veggies chosen had a good crunch to it and was all cut in perfect slices and or cubes.  Scenery was nice.  I will post pic of the poke.",

    "text": "4 star service. 1 star food. Came here last night on a friend's recommendation. Did it live up to it? Not by a long shot.  Poke trio: All poke lacked flavor. Poorly dressed/seasoned. Saku block tuna. Furikake chicken: Too much sweet sauce and batter.  Roast pork: Was actually decent. Tender. Gravy was good. But inconsistent. Again, loved the gravy. Kalbi: Either really burnt, or just charred. Not a lot of flavor.  Fried rice: Not so good. Poorly made. Don't get me wrong, it was a generous portion. Chasiu pork was overcooked. And there were lots of parts where there was just white rice and it wasn't evenly tossed together.  Now for the nitty gritty: The pork chops were a disaster. Overcooked would be a nice way to put it. It's as if someone went out of there way to sabotage these.  In my career, I've seen med, med well and well done, even x-well. But these chops-2 entrees worth, were a disaster. I felt bad for the person who made these. Whoever taught person how to cook should really re-evaluate what they are doing.  When we ordered another entree since 1 of theses orders was sent back, it took an eternity for it to come back out.   Our server was great though. Thru some miscommunication, a combo came out incorrect. She kindly brought out some teri-chicken to make up for it.   They were kind enough to remove the two pork chop entrees from the bill. Nice of them. And of course they added gratuity to the bill. Maybe they thought we weren't going to tip accordingly?  Simple rule of etiquette: When a restaurant has a lapse in food or service, they should never add gratuity. It's like adding fuel to the fire. A major slap in the face.   BUT, in this case, they actually saved us some money. We would have easily tipped based on service, and in this case, we would have tipped in addition for the items they removed from the bill. But they didn't give us the opportunity.  I chalk it up to every kitchen has a bad day. But in this case, it was awful, but saved with some nice service.  And it amazes me no owner, manager, or other came by to address the issue.",

    "text": "I now only come here for the sole purpose of their ahi poke, furikake style. I freaking love that stuff.   I'm basing this review off of my recent visit a few days ago:  When we walk in, we are immediately seated. Get our drink orders, take a few minutes to decide and all that jazz. Finally we go with an order of ahi poke for me, oxtail soup, a mixed plate of chopped steak and onions and chicken katsu, and a bowl of saimin (can't remember the name).   Ahi poke - 5/5 like always. Huge chunks of fresh fish. I can never finish the last few pieces of the regular order but I'm still hungry when I do the half order. That furikake style is the way to go though. I'm never going to order anything else!  Oxtail soup - 0/5 which was very disappointing since it was $11 of pure saltiness. At first I was in denial and blamed it on the ginger in the soup but as I continued to sip on it I couldn't even eat it anymore. SO SALTY! The meat wasn't very tender. Very disappointed with this one.   Chopped steak and onions & chicken katsu - 3/5 because the chicken katsu was incredibly bland. There was really no flavor at all and not even the katsu sauce could save it. They should have transferred some of the salt from that oxtail soup to that chicken. And usually I can never go wrong ANYWHERE with chicken katsu but wow I was disappointed since this place is a bit more pricier than Ohana Hawaiian BBQ. The chopped steak and onions was good though. Very greasy but it was good. Those onions even taste better than the katsu.   Saimin - 3/5. It was just OK nothing too special. At least this wasn't salty like the oxtail so that was a plus I guess. I dunno maybe I'll give this another try one day.   Service - 3/5. Does anyone ever smile here anymore!? I used to love the servers here because they were very friendly and welcoming but geez can you all at least pretend like you're in a good mood? It's a huge turn off when I can tell that workers hate their job. At least pretend like you want to be there! Our server especially was giving off a rude vibe. For the oxtail we asked for extra bowls so we can all share (there was 4 of us) and he only comes out with one. When we asked him again for more bowls he was like \"more bowls? Okayyyy but there's one right there.\" Fool I'm not blind, I know how to count. Don't try to pull it off like were stupid or something. We obviously are asking for more so we can share and we told you twice. That set me off a little.. but I wasn't going to make his day worse so I let it go.   I was really disappointed during this visit because I usually love coming here. Aside from the excellent poke, the food and service was just ehhh. Well I guess as long as I keep coming here for the poke, I won't be disappointed! :)",

It's one of my favorite cakes and I find myself thinking about this cake often.   Some of the dishes I didn't care for are the Korean chicken wings & galbi. I'm picky with Korean chicken wings and galbi. I'm not a big pork lover so I don't usually order pork dishes but my husband enjoys them.

I was already almost done w the food when the same server noticed and said, \"they cooked it?

Probably the best service I've gotten in Vegas! Love the aloha spirit :)  For dessert we ordered the kona coffee mud pie... And I was surprised at how big the slice was.

You you live near here and never been this us a must. The cafe is a little under attractive but the food, the vibe and the people well makes up for that and in all honesty it's not a bad looking or gross place at all there are just no decor and it's just a room with tables and a few island pictures and arts on the wall nothing fancy but who cares. I think it makes you feel like you are in Hawaii.  I happen to go on a Luau Friday when they have a little band set up for entertainment. I was greeted oh so warmly by everyone one with Hughes and back pats i mean it was as friendly as it can get.   We order the Chicken katsu with gravy on the side and the Chicken Furikake and Kalua Pork with cabbage and their churi fried rice and OMG let me tell you the Furikake chicken is (like most Yelpers have claimed) life changing. You must try to know what I am talking about and the Kalua port and cabbage I wish was a little bit more flavorful and juicy never the less was very good as well but man the Furikake chicken! The chicken katsu and gravy was amazing and the guava cake. Let's just say I'm not a huge guava liver and this cake was moist, tasty and the hint notes of the fruit with the semi sweet frosting was just perfect.   I am now a ginormous fan of this place and glad I finally tried it and now I'm telling everybody about it!",

We went on a week day for lunch, some other customers were coming and going but not too busy. Staff was excellent, we waited for some friends before ordering and they kept checking back with us until we were ready to order our food. Prices were great for the amount of food you get. I got the special of the day which was Mahi Mahi grilled in an egg batter. It was good but a bit bland. Their macaroni salad was not the best, a bit disappointing since I like macaroni salad. My husband got a Combo platter of Beef Teriyaki and Chicken Katsu with Korean Sauce (recommended by the waitress) they use on their Korean Chicken. All of his food was delicious. We decided to get a slice of  Haupia Cake...OMG! One of the best cakes I've ever had.  I will definitely go back again.",

Plus, I had some malasadas for to-go, because I've seen so much ad on instagram (foodies') thinking that it must be very good , but it was misleading. Probably they pay those instagrammers to advertise their food for them. Those malasadas had a very bad after taste- some kind of old used oil, cannot describe it but it was not even fluffy and fresh. I would be better off with other Hawaiian places.  Sorry I would not go back to this place.",

If you've read other reviews I've written about Hawaiian restaurants I always say that I'm Hawaiian in my heart and my belly.   The spot is super dark from the outside due to the the tinted windows but inside it's well lit and ready to serve you. When temperatures rise outside, it gets a bit cramped in the entrance. The decor is nothing special but that's okay because the shining star is the food.  The servings are very generous, which is great for my hunger and bad for my waistline, and the food is delicious. They were out of spam musubi (insert crying emoji here) but I ordered a mixed plate with their pork and katsu. Holy Hawaii batman. The gravy on the pork was the real MVP and the mac salad was heaven.   I convinced my dining buddy to share the mud pie with me and although it was beautiful - it was the one dish that left me wanting a little bit more. It was tick icy and not as creamy as I would have loved.",

The choices are really good, the quantity is plentiful, the flavors are authentic and the service is full of Aloha.   There is a daily special, Friday's is my favorite, the True Hawaiian plate, includes Laulau ( come early they do run out). The regular menu includes all the Hawaiian specialties and you can make a mixed plate as was our choice tonight.   I got the Furikake Chicken--Boneless chicken deep fried and tossed in a furikake glaze and Kalbi Short Ribs--Tender short ribs marinated in a Korean sauce and broiled to perfection. Two scoops rice and Mac salad finishes it off. The chicken was crispy chunks with lots of flavor, the kalbi was tender and so good!   My husband got a mixed plate as well, Teriyaki Chicken--Boneless, skinless chicken thighs marinated in a homemade Teri sauce and broiled, he also got Hawaiian Style Roast Pork--Cooked local style w/Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped w/rich homemade brown gravy. Also came with two scoops rice and Mac salad. Both so good. Teriyaki sauce is well flavored and the pork tender.  Of course we had to have dessert, tonight's choice, Chantilly cake, Chocolate cake, Chantilly frosting (evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter, vanilla extract). Moist, rich frosting, good choice!  Service is always excellent, they treat you like family and ensure you have everything you need. On Fridays and Saturdays they have live music but, you might have to wait for a table so plan ahead.",

My wife, her dad and our three kids (all under 5 with a baby) came here a few weekends ago. I would say they were moderately busy, as we were seated without a wait and the restaurant was maybe half capacity.   - They took nearly 10 minutes to take our order. - From the time they took our order it was an additional 43 minutes before the food was ready, yes, 43 minutes! So as anyone with young kids can qunderstand that is a very long time to keep them entertained and quiet. - After they brought the food to the table we didn't have silverware! We waited about 5 minutes (they disappeared) until my wife finally went to find someone and ask for it. And then they only brought two sets without even an apology! - The actual food wasn't even good! Ridiculously oily and no mention that the fried rice is actually pork fried rice (we all ordered non-pork dishes).  All aspects of our experience was bad, food, customer service (not saying anyone was mean or rude just very inattentive or not caring), and the extremely long wait. You should probably have the courtesy of letting your customers know that they will be waiting 45-1hr at the table before getting food, especially if they have kids. And where's the silverware!? Terrible overall experience.   I will be sticking with Makai Hawaiian food. Very fast service, good food, and a little cheaper.",

Everything in the menu is so insanely good, but if I had to pick one thing to eat here, it would be the furikake chicken. It's really crispy and has a ton of savory flavor while being not too sweet. And you have to pair this with the fried rice as an upgrade. The rice comes with marinated pork (chashu) and it pairs so well with all the meat dishes. This time, we ordered a poke sampler as well to get something light as well and oh my goodness.... this also blew our mind away. It came with 3 fried half avocados topped with different pokes and sauces. Wow. Just look at the picture I attached of it, and it looks amazing but it tasted even more amazing... Do yourself a favor and go here next time you're in the area. Also, there was live music on a Saturday night! A nice touch to an amazing experience.",

    "text": "This was our first visit and let me tell you, it won't be our last. You know a place must be good when there's a line forming before the place even opens. Always a great sign.   Upon entering, the place is something straight out of Hawaii. Calm, relaxed atmosphere with awesome Hawaiian reggae music playing. The restaurant is not large but they make good use of the space they have. The restaurant is SPOTLESS. Everything is nice and clean and well kept which is a big deal for me at eating establishments.   We were served by a sweet and friendly lady named Kim. She took EXCELLENT care of us and preanticipated our needs by keeping our drinks full, checking on us in a nonintrusive way and offering expedient service when we needed something.   Their island offerings are plenty. I ordered a mixed plate with Korean Kalbi and chicken katsu while my husband ordered the \"monstah\" plate with kalbi, katsu and kahlua pork and cabbage. Both plates were very HEFTY portions and they come with rice and Mac salad. The meats were excellent. Nicely prepared, moist, juicy and flavorful. The mac salad was meh and a bit underwhelming which was disappointing because I look forward to this as this is one of my favorites. We also ordered the spicy avocado poke and that was BOMB! Omg! Nicely marinated ahi tuna with sliced red onion, diced avocado and crispy wonton strips all envelopes in a creamy spicy siracha mayo. Yum-my!!!!  We are from out of town but will definitely be back when we are in town again. Thanks again to Island Flavor and to Kim and the rest of the staff for  great experience. Keep up the great work.

    "text": "When we come to Vegas, we always visit the local grindz. So when this place was close by, along with about 14 other hungry friends, this was the place for us.   We waited about 35 minutes for a table. Actually, a LOT of tables and trying to combine into one long strip. There was a bit of confusion as there wasn't enough chairs at first. We had problems finding servers to help us finding chairs and the lack of help seemed to be the re-curring problem we had here.   It was a hot day, not any different than the usual Vegas dry heat. We were parched and everyone ordered. 15 minutes later, first of the foods started to come out and some people were getting the wrong items at first. But slowly and surely, food sporadically came out one by one.  10 minutes into eating, we were still not served water nor any of our drinks we had ordered. It was a little tough hailing someone down for water. I do have to note there were 2 kitchen staff visible, and maybe 3 servers the whole restaurant.   As to what we ordered, the furikake chicken was too saucy. I had ordered the korean fried chicken and were only given the choice of wings and drums as thighs weren't available. It was tasty, but really would've loved to have thighs instead. Had also ordered the saimin soup noodles and the dashi tasted like hondashi and water.   We also got the big Loco Moco they had on the menu that had spam in it. Requested the eggs over easy and it was way well done. So overall as to the food, it did all sound so good, but with the exception of the KFC it did not live up the island food standards.   Sylvia told our large group that we can only divide up the checks into 4 different cards. That was fine with us, but she accidentally charged our card to one of our friend's bills. So after dealing how difficult it is to get water, service, and now this we figured that we'll just manage the bill among ourselves. So I charged our bill as well and our friends paid me in cash. Service of 18% was already added onto the bill for ease which was fine, but again hailing anyone down here was work in itself.   The little ordering pads I believe only takes menu orders for the kitchen I believe. The drink orders I think the waiter or waitresses have to be entered manually by them. Hence, we never got our POG but we were never billed for it either.   Sigh.  I sure hope this place change for the better.",

    "text": "Used to be one of my favorite Hawaiian food spots.  I was eating at Island Flavor since they first opened up, but have now lost love for their food ever since the original owners handed over the business to someone new.   Their portions have fallen smaller than from what they used to be and their taste in quality and in recipes have fallen as well. The food is still decent and you can still feel the culture and aloha that the restaurant gives (it's nice to see a restaurant that is truly meant for 9th island locals).   The new expansion they have is an improvement; there's a bigger and better waiting area, it's much easier for big parties to be seated (which is often when your customers are island oriented), and you can tell how much it has improved the restaurant's efficiency.   This place is still worth eating at but it gets 3 stars from me just because the food is not as good, hearty and plentiful it used to be.",

    "text": "SAD that this place USED to have 5 Stars and there's SO Many 1 Stars now. I was contemplating giving it a 1 Star but decided on 2, ONLY because they get the desserts from the lady who does Pa'Ina's (you're welcome). And since I didn't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain, I opted Island Flavor.  Like a lot of the reviewers, I've been coming here since 2013, when this place was rocking with happy customers and workers. There was always a wait to come eat here. I've been in here a few times since the changeover to see how it's going. (I didn't want to believe what other Yelpers wrote.) It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't as bad where I 'Had' to write a review too. Until last week...  So here it goes:   I come in on a weekday at 2pm. The place was sparsely packed with customers and I was seated promptly by Sylvia. (Yay!) We ordered our drinks ( iced tea, Coke, Sprite and water with lemon on the side). She brought out the drinks a few minutes later, MINUS the lemon. We asked her for the lemon and she looked irritated but went and got it.  Sylvia disappeared so Tina came and took our orders on some little tablet. While we were telling her what we wanted, she took a deep breadth and sighed while looking at the cooks. I'm like WTF, so I said, 'Is everything ok?' She kinda shook her head, waved her hand and said, 'Nothing.' So we continued with our order. It was then,  that we realized she either didn't speak English well or didn't know how to input it. We had to talk reaaallly slooow for her to get it.   Here comes Sylvia, she I'm assuming disappeared because it was probably her lunch break, but never told us she was leaving so when she passed by, I said 'Hey Sylvia, when you get a chance, can we get a refill please?' (Hey it was 106* out there!!!) She didn't answer but rolled her eyes, took a deep breadth, looked at our cups, turned around and brought us a refill.  I was about to confront her!!!  But I have Aloha. Hahaha  A minute later she's eating at the table. Ok I get it, she was probably clocked out. I overheard Tina asked if she can have a try. Hey, I like try too!   Tina comes and drops off our food after 17 minutes. We thank her and we start eating. I couldn't help feel that negative vibe from the two of them. I asked my friends if it was me feeling it or them too. They ALL agreed that both Sylvia and Tina were not being aloha.   Dessert time. The main reason for coming here was because I was impressed with the new marketing  director with his creative pictures. (Yes, I gave him a title haha) HE made me want to come in and check out Island Flavor again and to order chantilly cream puffs. So kudos to that photographer!   Sylvia totally fucked dessert up. We ordered 3 desserts but changed one of them. She came out with FOUR....oh well, after Mgmt sees this, Sylvia and Tina will either be fired or thoroughly trained.   My question is, WHY hire servers who know nothing about your restaurant and have NO Aloha?  I was really surprised that you didn't hire a local, but from another country? Come on!!!   To be honest, Island Flavor should be relocated closer to the strip because this place seems more of a 'tourist' place than a local restaurant. I really DID NOT enjoy my visit here and with my Yelp review and word of mouth, yeah.....Good Luck!",

I was starving after a long flight and had a huge serving of Hawaiian roast pork with gravy and Kalua pork and cabbage with a mountain of rice and a huge tossed salad for less than the price of a mediocre burger at one of the strip mega-casinos. Of course, I had a Kona Longboard Lager to wash down tmy massive Hawaiian feast.  I'll check this place out again if I'm in the area and I'll have to check and see if there's a Hawaiian restaurant a bit closer too.",

Owners: you need a open sign when it is dark for those who do not know.    The service was good but we were the only people eating at first.    The roast pork with gravy all over. 3.00 stars for me.  Chicken Teri 5 stars just so much flavor.  Chicken katsu 3 stars light but it was kind of sry and just not anything special.   Kalbi beef/ 5 stars so full of flavor unlike the last time I wrote a review.   Furikaki chicken 3 stars flavor alone is 5 stars but the chicken was day.  Sadden they have sold but the food still hasn't been compromised.  The fruitcake  The furikake chicken was kind of dry but ok.   I think I came when they changed ownership the last time and found it average not a mouth craving taste.  This time was different.",

I couldn't tell if they were toppings you added or those were the types of poke. The woman at the counter said there were too many ingredients to list on the menu which was not helpful. I'm obviously ignorant and need to be educated. I ordered the Hawaiian poke which she said came with seaweed. My husband ordered the kalbi which looked beautiful from the pix online.   It turns out the poke doesn't come with rice so I added a side (I think it was $2.25 for two scoops) and a side of macaroni salad. My husband asked for teriyaki sauce or whatever sauce they may have for the kalbi, but the woman said they don't have sauce. \"It doesn't need it because it's marinated\"   If this is authentic Hawaiian then I guess I prefer american-adulterated Hawaiian. The poke fish was good, but I missed all the toppings you can get at a poke counter. The kalbi was good but a little dry.  The one truly delicious item here is the guava cake! Do light and fluffy - it's like flavored angel food cake with whipped cream filling. Luckily we got two giant pieces so we didn't have to share!",

I got the roast pork and my friend  the Korean fried chicken.   The app finally showed up 10 minutes later? My drink was half way gone by now. We watched as food was coming out from the kitchen, they were bringing food out one order at a time!! I thought  this was strange I get that food has different cooking times but the food going to the same table and now you have one person eating and the other person watching you eat??!??????  One by one I painfully watched this occur to table after table, mine included. I got my roast pork and my friend watched me eat!!! I normally would wait as this is proper dining protocol. I was hungry sorry, and some of the roast pork was cold???? Wth   10 minutes later the korean chicken came out to our table, I asked about why so long? Well chicken takes a long time to cook..... ok I guess but the food should still arrive at the same time or even a little  closer together.  Now I have the pleasure of watching my friend eat as I am almost done!    The server is now taking orders of other tables and has not come back over to check on us yet? My drink was empty 10 minutes ago??!?!? Still no offer for refills... he finally comes over and asks if we need anything else?? Really,,,nope the check will do just fine. Sad because I really wanted dessert !   I miss the old owners and the way things used to be, maybe instead of spending all the money on renovations how about some training for the workers?? Kitchen needs help and so do the servers...... sad really the food was not bad, the portions are smaller and the rice was dry.  All in all come guys you can do better.",

Was willing to give this place a try but man Alisa really needs to work on doing better. This is NO island flavor vibe as it was for me back in 2012. Shouldn't have asked for chef darcy since he's prolly shady too. All of these employees have something to hide like Tina, Tyler, or Christine. Servers don't need to be rude or so brash. This place has changed dramatically and with every single person saying she's referred to \"You Hawaiian's\" or \"Get the FUCK OUT\" to  good employees is shame on the owner. You think you're doing you're job but NOPE. You haven't learned shit. Putang inaba.   To Chef Darcy: you need to shut the fuck up and get off your ass and rub it old man, cause you don't know shit asshole. I don't have a girlfriend and she sure as hell wouldn't work for you dipshit. lol nice try but no. You suck. -YOU CAN'T FUCK OR COOK",

It was BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS. She personally brought it out to us.. sang happy Birthday with us and cut and plated the cake slices for our party.

I'm so happy this place is still thriving the way they are.  I've seen so many places come and go but this place is the bomb.  I highly recommend this spot.  Right off Durango.  This place is a good to homey place.   Prices are good and portions are bada$$.  Of course I had to get the famous loco moko also ordered the new combos.  The food changed a lot.  New management is obvious.  Love it. All my elites come here!!  Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place.

(I think) with an \"Aloha!\" and asked us \"tree?\" (that's \"three\" pronounced da kine). We were seated immediately and given menus. So hard to choose from the list of grinds. So many good local eats I was almost drooling. After \"studying\" the menu for sometime we got the Kalbi Short Ribs. My boss ordered the Chef's Loco Moco.  The servings were \"choke\" (meaning a lot or large amount)... hubby and I shared the plate of Kalbi Short Ribs (over 1-lb of marinated kalbi goodness). It came with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. It was incredibly satisfying... you knoh, brok da mout kine! I love Kalbi and the meat was so tastefully delicious and soft. The Chef's Loco Moco my boss ordered came shaped like a volcano (mushroom & onion brown gravy on rice, topped with beef & pork belly patty, 3 (tree?) eggs, Spam and Portuguese sausage with green onions to garnish) ohmygaahhhh! I feel a food coma coming on!   This isn't L&L, that's for sure. This place is sure to bring me back to Vegas soon! I still want to try the Furikake Chicken that fellow Yelper, Patrick Y, recommended as well as their desserts! Curious to try some avocado fries too. The dining room is a good size. That's good so it can accommodate the crowd... the restaurant seems to have a large following, and our server was the nicest! I almost called her 'Aunty'   We pau foh now... JR (or as they say in the Islands, Juniah! for Junior), please take me back again to Vegas soon!  Review #1334",

    "text": "Not a bad choice for Hawaiian food overall.  We decided to drop in and grab some food to go.  The inside is cool and has lots of Hawaiian-themed decor; there was even a live band singing and playing Hawaiian tunes which was cool.  The interior was clean and simple and didn't seem too crowded.  We decided to try the chicken katsu and the beef teriyaki and kalbi.  The katsu was OK.  It was crispy outside, but the chicken didn't seem to be of the best quality though it seemed like it was breast meat.  The teriyaki and kalbi were both quite good.  Tender and flavorful and not too much fat on the kalbi which is sometimes a pet peeve.    Someone was passing around samples of malasadas which were quite good, but they didn't seem to have any on display so it was unclear how to actually buy them.    Staff overall seemed friendly.  Overall this was a perfectly decent place we might try again though nothing really stood out too much.",

My group of 10 waited almost an hour to get our food because the waitress said \"it got lost\" in the orders. One waitress took our drink and food order on her tablet but then a second waitress came to take our drink orders again on a note pad because she said it did not come through on the system.  Our waitresses seemed very unorganized and were running around trying to get our order out. On the plus side, they kept apologizing for the delay and seemed genuine.   On a positive note, the food is good!! I couldn't decide what to order because everything on the menu sounded so delish.  Overall, the major con in my dining experience was the poor technical part. The waitress also had a hard time getting our check and then swiping each of our cards on her little tablet.",

    "text": "THEY HAVE BEER *cheers* First timer here! I hear all the buzz all the time about this place from all my family members who eat here. I'm from over the border aka CA so I knew the next time I'm in Vegas to try ISLAND FLAVOR to see for myself.   Immediately greeted and welcomed by Kehau who is just the sweetest! Def felt like I was in my Auntys house getting ready to eat bc of her. Even the other servers were so good about refilling our drinks and being communicative. I was trying so hard not to call Kehau \"Aunty\" she is just that awesome!  The place is SUPER CLEAN & I can tell they've done A LOT of remodeling and upgrades in which someone who LOVES interior design/home decor like me, will appreciate. It's a good enough space for everyone to have plenty of room to relax a bit after eating lol.  The Food was BOMB.DOT.COM! Okuuurt! I LOVED how big the servings were. I got the Monstah Mix Plate which comes with 3 meats, 3 scoops of rice and 1 scoop Mac salad. I was HUNGRY when I came, didn't eat all day just to save myself up for this place. We got here at like 8pm lol and I tried so hard not to order appetizers bc I wanted to try the infamous Furikake Chicken. So I got 2 servings of Furikake Chicken & Short Ribs.  Furikake Chicken was on point! If you are not a fan of seaweed I would suggest you ask for them to not add that on as they sprinkle the seaweed bits on top of the Furikake. Boneless tender chicken bits dipped in sweet yet tangy sauce with chopped green onions. Short ribs is good per usual.  GUAVA CAKE! Okeehhhh this slice of cake is huge! I love guava cake so just looking at that slice of heaven I already knew, that's the one! you def have got to try the guava cake or take one to go bc it's no joke man lol.  Overall, it was a GREAT experience. Had a great time with my fam, shared laughs and most importantly enjoyed AWESOME FOOD in a great environment. I would def come back here next time I'm in town. I knew prior to coming here they had changed ownership, and everything in the restaurant is up to date and is catered to people from all walks of life but of course to us islanders. I encourage you to try it out & give these new owners a chance! You won't be disappointed at all & if you are then something is wrong with your tastebuds lol. Thank you Island Flavor!!!!!",

We started out with ahi poke, it came out in decent time, huge chunks of ahi, seasoned well with sesame.. delicious! My boyfriend and I both ended up getting the breakfast with rice and eggs, his with Portuguese sausage and mine with spam. Again, both very good.. but then again, how can you really mess those up? haha. Ok, now to the one star.. Upon walking in, there was a lady at the register right next to the door, she didn't say anything. She didn't even budge to maybe attempt to acknowledge that we walked in. My boyfriend then asked her how SHE was doing, she answered and then nothing! He then asked if we just seat ourselves, she said 'sure'.. no menus, nothing.. So I took it upon myself to grab two menus and we took a seat. (mind you, we were the only two in there besides the employees). Someone eventually came over and took our order.. \"are you two ready yet?\".. uh, yeah..sure.. sorry for the inconvenience. Just when we thought we were in the home stretch, the lady at the register starts making this god awful clearing of a throat noise every 45-60 seconds. Over and over and over and over...(fast forward to us leaving..) and over again. It wasn't just a little ah hem, it was like she had something seriously stuck in there and I was completely surprised she didn't end up spitting a chunk of something each time. It was so bad that it got to the point where my boyfriend was going to ask her if she needed him to get her water or something for her throat. Overall, food was good, but the service..I will NOT be returning because it was just THAT bad. I'm sorry to inconvenience you with my patronage, I won't be doing that anymore.",

The restaurant has a very laid back feel to go along with that \"island style\" of living. I went back later that week on Aloha Friday and there were food specials and live music. The place was packed and I'm glad I even got a table. All in all, the place is definitely a place I would go back to time and time again.",

The serving size was huge!  I couldn't finish it so I doggie bagged it. 3 girls from a local halau did a nice hula auana. Made me want to do hula again.

I don't know one person that didn't like their experience or food at the restaurant. It's True, IT IS THE BEST HAWAIIAN /LOCAL FOOD IN LAS VEGAS. (I've tried several others) I ordered the Hawaiian plate with kalua pig & cabbage (lau lau was sold out) it was good, they give ALOT of food, however I'm here to rave about their desserts. THE KONA MUD PIE IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER TASTED. Food Orgasm is an understatement, also the GUAVA CAKE omg...THE BEST. The Poke...hella fresh. It's sad we have to go to Vegas to eat the best poke, kona mud pie, and guava cake. I'm from Maui and we have nothing that comes close to that. I'll definately go back to Island Flavor whenever I go back to Vegas. HANA HOU!!",

My uncle said the oxtail soup was ono, but little bit different from how he usually gets it because the ginger is usually grated on the top.  He also said that compared to Maui the oxtail here is couple dollars cheaper. My aunty liked her order of kalbi too.  It was an extreme portion and she finished it all.  I got kalua pig and cabbage, which was an awesome portion too.  My auntie's looked the best though.  Afterwards we got chantilly cake and I got to say this was one of the best chantilly cakes I've had.  We weren't expecting such a big piece and I took it home to my boyfriend, who never had chantilly before and liked it.  When I come back here I'm definitely getting kalbi and sharing the cake.  It was all so good and it got my family's approval!",

Cool, we still had a half hour. WRONG! We got there and the sign on the door had their new hours.... closed at 9:30pm. NOOOO!!!! Wait, what's going on? What the heck? We were going in the door. They said yes! They took us all at closing time without hesitation or an attitude. We sat down, ordered and ate. One of the waitresses worked at the same location as my friend (at her other job). What a great staff! The food was ono and the portions were frickin' huge. I ordered the fried rice which came with egg on top and a few pieces of the biggest Portuguese sausage EVER! Everyone really loved the food and most of us had to take the leftovers to go. The Chantilly cake is awesome! It seems like the hours have changed again according the their website. Go early, be hungry. Thank you to the staff that night for taking us in and being great about it.",

I'm working my way through the menu and have tried almost everything on it including some of the specials.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It isn't your normal main land Hawaii food place.  If you go to hawaii, our menus are not made up of just teriaki, musubis, katsu, and native Hawaiian food (lau lau, kalua pig etc.) Of course not! We have roast beef and hamburger steaks and all kinds of things from around the world.  The thing is, we have our own way for cooking them with our own flavor.  Thats what this place is all about!  It takes foods from different cultures in Hawaii and gives it that made in Hawaii taste.  So from misoyaki opakapaka to korean chicken to ox tail you can get a real Hawaii restaurant feel (Big Island style anyways).  The best Hawaii food spot in vegas I've eaten at so far.  Aloha kitchen is a joke, L & L is imitation, Ross J's is GREAT, but this place this the BEST! (Note: sometimes the gravey salty, meant to be eaten with lots of rice, sooooo gooood!)PS dessert is good too!",

The hamburger steak was the real winner for me. The patty was well seasoned, but the brown gravy was what made it. You could tell that they made their gravy from scratch not not a box like some places *cough*L&L*cough*.   Service: The lady was really nice and attentive. She seated us and took our order right away. I did wait a little bit for a drink refill though.   Misc: Its pretty nice inside. They have a bar eating area with a flat screen TV to watch.

Modern local Hawaiian music (kinda reggae) passed the time nicely while reading the WSJ.  Crowded for lunch - best to drop in after 1:30pm.",

    "text": "I went last Friday night (12/18/15). They had live music and it was AMAZING!!! We arrived at the perfect time, 6pm right when the music was about to start. I ordered the Mixed Plate: Furikake Chicken and Chicken Katsu with brown rice and mac salad (my friend ordered the fried rice, I am getting that next time). IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN TOWN! Now, typically when I consume that much food all I want to do is go home and lay on the couch until it digests.... Boy was I wrong!!!! I found myself not even wanting to leave. After attempting to eat all of our food (it was huge). We decided if we wanted to stay and watch the rest of the performance it was only necessary to try some dessert. Well, we couldn't narrow it down to just one, so we tried 4 different desserts. We ordered the Chantilly Cake, Guava Cake, Haupia Cake, and the Coco Puffs! We couldn't decide if the Chantilly or the Guava was our favorite, but they were all delicious. Like I said in the beginning, we arrived at 6pm but fell in love with everything about this restaurant and the atmosphere that we didn't end up leaving until 9. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL BE BACK & A REGULAR, WHEN I COME BACK FROM OAHU.",

On that notion Lynn warmly recommended the hawaiian Ahi poke, the one with sesame, she suggested.  Ahi poke it is, big chunks of deep red and raw goodness nicely marinated with shoyu, green onions, sesame oil and more sesame~ To keep the ahi entertained, i also ordered some french fries along with a side of macaroni salad to satisfy my secret urge to eat fries with mayonnaise.  This combo initially raised a few eyebrows but after some effort on my part to promo the mayo-fries duo, there were empathetically accepted.  Although this joint does not fall on my normal route of commute, i will not hesitate to go back and try out a few more items on the menu.",

I have never ever finished and entree there.  For starters they have the best Poke' in town that come in different seasoning, Furikake and Shoyu, Sorry I forgot the other flavor. But all our good just depends on which you like better. I recommend sharing this though tis too much for one person, well at least to me.  I have tried every dish, and all are great. no joke. The have the best roast pork loco moco in town. It's like a loco mock, but no hamburger meat just lots of tender pork. They're loco mock is also bomb with huge serving. The kalbi ribs and korean chicken wings are so delicious, like finger licking good. I think they're fired rice is the best in town because it gives me flash back of my childhood, when my aunt first cooked and served me the first time i ever ate friend rice. Like that critic from ratatouille, when he took a bite and he remembered his mom making it for him. haha If you can ever make it on fridays nights, they have the best LauLau to me in town, this dish really reminds me for hawaii. I wasn't born in Hawaii but i do go there yearly, so this food is as good as it gets to hawaiian dishes.  Lastly, if you can save room for deserts. They are all great,a dn from what i heard they are made by the bakery next door to it. You must eat Huapia cake and Chantilly cake, I would say a slice but they way they serve slices, its like a small cake. haha  the staff is always friendly, never had a bad encounter, just don't be shocked how fast they move, because they do everything, there are no busers or food runners helping, just the waitress.",

He did a great job making people laugh, having some playful banter and just keeping the overall mood light and fun. Be sure to tip the performer too if you find yourself grooving along :D. I got the Laulau which is usually only available on Friday nights. It contains haupia (coconut-flavored) and smoked fish flavors, but I happen to be a really big fan of those seemingly conflicting tastes and would definitely order it again. The other Hawaiian staples all look delicious here and their portions are huge! You'll definitely have enough food for breakfast or lunch the next day and I would recommend everyone at the table getting something different so you can get a taste of everything. I've also been craving POG since I was last in Hawaii, so I was excited to see that they give 50 cent refills here! I was super appreciative that the owner took time to talk to us on a busy night and welcome us since it was our first time here. He even apologized for the not-so-long wait, which was actually the most enjoyable wait I've ever had at any restaurant. This is definitely a great place to bring friends and family, without the hustle and bustle of the strip.",

    "text": "When that craving for some food from the island hits, there's no escaping it.  It's a hunger like no other. Luckily, over at Island Flavor, they give some of the largest portions that I have ever seen. It's like Hash House A Go Go-portions for Hawaiian Cuisine, except the food here is actually good.  The place was a bit on the empty side around 11am on a late Saturday morning. Seeing an empty place on a weekend always leaves me a bit hesitant to eat somewhere. But, I had a gut instinct telling me to eat here anyway. I'm glad I did. Here's what we went with:  Fried Rice Omelet - When this dish is served to you, it looks like a majestic mountain pile, capped at the peak with a generous amount of scrambled egg. Along with it, comes three giant pieces of Portuguese sausage, nestled around the edges of the plate. The fried rice, packed underneath, has to be some of the best fried rice that I've ever had in this town. It had a bit of a unique sweet flavor to it, mixed in with some small bits of diced pork. I'm pretty sure this serving was good enough to feed 3-4 people. I stared at this modern marvel for a few seconds before I dug in. It was beautiful sight.  Loco Moco - Another heavily portioned dish with a likewise amount of brown gravy, to boot. I sampled a bit of it. Not bad! the hamburger patty included with it was humongous, as expected. Loco Moco is much too heavy a dish for me to conquer on my own. I'd probably come back for this if I wanted to drown a day of depression in gravy.  Huge portions, great flavors, friendly staff.. there's isn't much more I could want in a restaurant.",

I tend to order the half orders because one full serving is way too much! The only time I ever get a full order is if I'm ordering to-go so that I can eat it throughout the day.   My favorite dish is the loco moco plate. The meat is huge!! They probably pack it there themselves because I rarely ever see such big portions anywhere else. It's a nice change from seeing the single beef patties on top of the rice like most other places. They're also very generous on the amount of gravy they pour over everything. Oh and the egg was cooked perfectly. I always get my eggs sunny side up and they have never messed it up here. Another one of my favorite items here is the furikake ahi poke. It used to be a lot cheaper per pound but now they sell it by market price. I believe it was around $14/lb last time I was there. Not too bad but it was definitely a lot cheaper before. They can do half orders for the poke too if you don't wanna spend too much. Another one of my favorites here is the katsu curry plate. Although last time I got it, the curry was a little salty. Not overly salty but I had to eat more rice to compensate.   I've heard their oxtail soup here is to die for. I haven't tried it yet but it's on my list of things to try along with their guava cake. I can't wait! Island Flavor is my go to hawaiian food spot. Cheap food with giant portions... can't beat that!",

I've had just about everything on their menu, from the Furikake chicken which is their best seller to local favorites like Loco Moco, Chicken Katsu, Saimin, Roast Pork and lots more. Prices are up to par with the food quality and service. So whether you're from the islands or not, this place is definitely a must try when in Vegas!",

    "text": "This place has great reviews from Yelpers, so I went with Chad S. to see what was up.  We arrived around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and there were only two tables open, as the place was busy, always a good sign.  I already knew that I wanted Kalbi, so no need to really peruse the menu.  Our friendly waitress took our orders and then our food arrived quickly, which was a great thing because we were hangry.  I was very pleased that I got four big pieces of Kalbi and there was meat on them bones, not a lot of fat, which can happen with this dish.  There were also two big scoops of white rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I ate one scoop of the rice and didn't touch the mac salad, but only because I am trying to be more protein-oriented and eat less of the bad carbs, but you gotta have some rice with your meat, right?  The kalbi looked and tasted like it just came off the BBQ in someone's backyard; after three pieces, I was fully satisfied.  I'm just sad that we couldn't get any of the Spam Musubi before we left.  They have musubi in a warmer next to the cash register so you can buy some to go; they sold out while we were eating.  Oh well, it just gives me an excuse to go back.  Aloha!",

They give you nice cut kalbi too. Their kalua pork is good as well. Very tender and juicy. Even their macaroni salad tastes better than other places. Their prices are very reasonable. Most entrees are around $9. They get real busy during lunch or dinner hours, so try to get there earlier to secure a table or be prepare to wait. Friendly service all around. They also have another location on eastern and pebble. A must try if you love the island flavor! ;)",

Their portions are HUGE, food is very delicious, prices are very reasonable (very cheap for their serving size, if you ask me.. but I'm not complaining), and it's a nice family owned restaurant that gives you that \"Ohana\" feeling.  My favorite dish is the Furikake Chicken. I eat a lot of food, but I always have left overs enough to satisfy my appetite for my next meal. Their Kalbi BBQ is also really good.  Their bathroom is very clean. For a restaurant whose been around for several years, I was expecting a not-so-clean bathroom. However, I was totally wrong.  The servers are friendly. However, every time I come here, they always miss 1 thing we order or they forget to bring something we asked for.... And it happens all the time!  Nonetheless, I still love coming here & am definitely a regular.",

At Island Flavor, he'd be an invaluable asset to me.  The portions here are fit for a proper luau. You get an inordinate amount of food for most humans to consume in a single serving, so I highly advise splitting dishes unless you're the type to go HAM at buffets - which, in Vegas, wouldn't be hard to believe.  Mixed plate is my jam: 2 meats with 2 scoops of rice for about $12 is unbeatable. With kalbi (an extra $1) and furikake - my tummy is rumbling just thinking about how good it was.  Did I mention how much food you get here? I left a couple pieces of chicken on my plate because I was about to burst, and my hotel room didn't have a fridge for leftovers. Garrett O., where are you???  The overall environment is what you'd expect of a Hawaiian restaurant - friendly, laid back, chill. You feel like a part of the family by just dining here.  Island Flavor is a definite pit stop the next time I'm in Vegas. And Garrett O., you're coming with me!",

Their food portion sizes are on the generous side compared to other restaurants and isn't pricey at all. I'll usually have enough leftover to have a small meal for another time as do most people that I've seen eating here. My usual order is the Furikake Chicken, but change it up now and then. I like the classic staple of the Loco Moco and the flavor of the Korean Chicken.  Ideally I'd like to see this location expand in size as well add more locations.

We've been living in Vegas for more than 10 years (born and raised in Honolulu) so we have a very good idea at what makes up good \"local kind grindz\"!  The food is so ono (delicious, for my non Hawaiians) and the portions are, as President Trump would say, YUGE!!! I had my usual mixed plate consisting of furikake chicken and steak and onions!  Yummy!  Wife had the same chicken and kalbi, younger kids shared a chicken katsu and older son and his girlfriend had two different versions of the loco moco.  Her loco moco had roast pork and his had chicken katsu.  Yeah, they were all good!  Wife and I shared a large slice of haupia ice cream pie for dessert. The whole meal was a festival of flavors in our mouths!  Along with the food, the ambiance of the place is worth mentioning too.  It always brings us home to Hawaii.  There's Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is decorated with Hawaii themed memorabilia and the workers are friendly, just like the people back home.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with the other places, they just don't stack up.  If you're craving truly authentic local Hawaiian food, then this is the place to be, period!",

I've been wanting to come on a night with live music but my Fridays have been consumed with school stuff so hopefully, I can make it happen in the near future! We ordered the roasted pork and furikake shrimp! So ono, made our opus happy! It was flavorful, definitely living up to their name. They have daily specials for specific dishes so you know I wanna come back on a day they have beef stew! I'm so glad they are now open on Sundays and Mondays! We did have to wait for a table but I see this as a good thing since the food is good! The service is just like I'm back home and not that franchise feel. Always clean and always too full to try dessert. Portions are huuuuuge so share or expect to take some home.",

Better off driving to Ross J's, 2 Scoops of Aloha or Cinnamon's. Ohana BBQ has much better Hawaiian Food than this establishment.

It is heavy on the ginger, and the meat was a bit tough, but the broth was above average. Don't expect the same type of flavor as California hotel. I think they use bouillon cubes or some heavy MSG, so it isn't as salty.   The beef stew on Saturday's is super popular, but I didn't like the taste too much. It sorta seemed like they added a lot of cornstarch, flour, gelatin, or something to thicken the sauce and I was not enjoying the flavor.   Still yet, for the service as well as their standout items like the loco moco, furikake chicken, and their chicken katsu, this place is a solid win when it comes to bang for your buck.",

Ironically the way the order was being placed, there would have been a double vegetable side and a starch and vegetable side w the two dinners. Of course this was figured out after we left. For years this request had been accommodated. But now because of \"cost\" the chef won't do it. No up charge was offered for 2 vegetable sides either. I've been carb free for several months and can now cross this place off my list of eateries. I'm very disappointed by this!

Come early to avoid a wait because this place gets packed!  I decided to order to-go their Sunday Lunch Special Kimchi Fried Rice, and Korean Chicken.  Portion was exceptional.  A generous serving of Kimchi Fried Rice enough, for lunch and dinner.  You'll enjoy the sour kick from the kimchi, slices of chashu pork, onion, and soy sauce if it was not destroyed by over salting; which, was unfortunately disappointing.  Furthermore, the Korean chicken was sweet, and crispy, but like its Kimchi Fried Rice partner it's just too salty.  Unsure if the chef  was having an off day, but I expected to be blown anyway from the reviews.  Fortunately, the Macaroni salad was delicious.  It was creamy, yet light, and deliciously worth ordering on its own.  My rate in order is based on atmosphere, cleanliness, presentation, taste and overall satisfaction.",

Our favorite is the teriyaki beef w/ fried rice.  The fried rice alone is a meaty meal!!  If you like Hawaiian BBQ, this is a must go!  Lacking 1 star for the location and lack luster restaurant.  The staff is friendly but seemingly always rushing because they're constantly busy!   It's ambiance gets zero stars.    * I think that they'd forgotten about our take out order once which kept my husband there for approx 20mins.

The spare ribs were nice and tender with no gamey aftertaste so you know it was cooked with love.    The sides were really good too.  The Mac Salad was also very tasty, quite possibly my favorite Mac Salad now, and the Rice was nice.  For dessert we had the Haupia Cake, and they are serious about their dessert too.  A nice mountainous slice of fluffy Cake and the Whipped Cream looked like an avalanche..  It was great.  The restaurant was nice and clean.  Nothing on the floors and the countertops and tables were all clean and clear.  The service was fast and friendly.  I think the quality of the food outweighs the price by far.

The only thing I didn't like about this place is the loco moco. The gravy is a tad bit too salty. Taste like salt to me. But it's just my opinion idk.  Overall this is a good place to eat!

    "text": "This is the closest Hawaiian place to us and I was so happy that they got such great ratings on yelp. Although I didn't feel like it was mind-blowing, Island Flavor will now be our go-to Hawaiian place whenever we have the craving for it.   Furikake Chicken- I have never had Furikake Chicken before this and first bite was AMAZING. It was crispy, sweet, and cooked just right. After about the third bite, it was getting to be too sweet for me so I stopped.  Kalua Pig- Every time we try a new Hawaiian place, I ALWAYS order their Kalua Pig first. (i don't know why) There's was good but I feel like I could use a bit more of the juices. The meat was tender and the cabbage was cooked just right, but I would have wanted some of the soup to moisten my rice with  Chicken Katsu- pretty standard. Their sauce with the katsu was delicious. Finally, a katsu sauce that hasn't been watered down!  Roasted Pork Loco Moco- I know there are a lot of amazing reviews on this but I thought it was just 'meh'. The gravy was a little lighter than I would like and it lacked a bit of flavor. Maybe it was just an off night? I feel like loco moco is a hawaiian staple, so to mess it up would be blasphemy.  I mean they didn't \"mess it up\" but I have had and (made) better. Again, it may have been an off night and it definitely won't stop me from coming back.   Spam musubis- these were awesome and even had a layer of extra flavor in between the spam and rice. I'm not sure what it was but I know it was green and may have had sesame seeds? Whatever it was, we loved it!  Chantilly cake- DELICIOUS! it was as if chocolate cake and tres leches had a baby.   Guava Cake- So good and so PINK! it wasn't overwhelmingly guava-y and not too sweet. Just right!  Our first impression was not as good as I would have liked. We ordered our food to-go and when we got home, we realized we didn't have the right order. Thankfully, it only takes less than 10 minutes to get there from our house. My bf drove back to get our order and he came back with a complimentary piece of guava cake. They were all really nice when we were there, so not mad at all. Definitely coming back!",

She knows the ins and outs and had our dishes come out perfectly! The furikake chicken was the best and everything we had was cooked to perfection. The cherry on top was the guava cake, so light and delicious you could eat fifty of them! I was most impressed by how much the owner and staff cared about the customers in the end!  Pros: 1. Amazing waitress 2. Spectacular customer service! 3. Furikake chicken ftw 4. Delicious guava cake 5. Live music!!!  Cons: 1. Took two tries to get it right 2. Food was so good you have to eat it all",

    "text": "Mahalos to Island Flavor for coming to the 9th island and sharing what good Local food is all about. Island Flavor does local food right...Thank God!!!  If you have a craving for local food this is the go to place in Las Vegas. Its a sit down restaurant but they also have counter service. The place is clean, everyone is always friendly. and the food is ONO!  Not many Hawaiian restaurants in the mainland make me feel like i'm back at home but Island Flavors does exactly that every single time. I've tried a lot of their menu but my favorites are:  1. Love their Oxtail stew- Its ONO period. 2. Any of their Loco Moco's- hard to finish off its a mountain. 3. They got good poke...best on Fri/Sat when fish comes in 4. Pocho Bean soup...very good, almost like my Aunty's-almost 5. Roast Pork...melt in your mouth!  6. and of course their hand wrapped Laulau's- I think its served only on Aloha Friday. Its a good thing they only serve it on Fri or I would have to buy new pants. 7. Their mixed plate is like the Zip pac on steroids! So much food...and much better.  This place is a winner in my book. They would put a lot of local restaurants in Hawaii to shame. What are you waiting for? Stop Yelping for a minute and drive your okole to Island Flavors. And don't forget to bring your appetite because they pile it on. Trust me, you'll be taking food home unless you are sharing your plate with 2 other people.  Aloha to you too!",

I lived in hawaii for about a year, and i've never had oxtai soup until recently at Island Flavor.  I was apprehensive at first, the thought of eating oxtail and all.  But I must say, i'm glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt, because it was delicious.  The broth  was so comforting, the meat of the oxtails were so tender, and the order is huge.  Now, i'm an avid oxtail soup eater at Island Flavor.  My husband swears by their korean chicken.  I've tried it and it's pretty good.  My 4 year old grubs on their barbecue chicken, which tastes ten times better than other hawaiian restaurant bbq chickens.  I also like how their beef is an actual steak.  None of that thin sliced beef teriyaki allllll the other mediocre hawaiian joints serve.",

What I had: I was in the mood for greens (after eating too much fried food and pizza), so I tried their salad, mixed plate of cabbage & pork + ribs.  My friend had fried noodles.   We couldn't even try dessert.  The salad was very simple just cut romaine with a couple of slices of some type of sweet purple potato (?), cucumber and tomato.  The dressing was really good and it was topped with all these crispy fried wontons.  nothing special, but pleasing.  The meals were really enjoyable.  Cabbage & pork is my comfort food, and this was perfectly seasoned and moist.  The ribs are to die for:  really must have.  And the fried noodle special was thoroughly enjoyable.  Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu.",

Laulau I think it is called - with all of the leaves and meat.

I don't think you can immitate the freshness that you get from Hawaii.  You purchase by weight and we were allowed to place a mix of 3 types of poke to come out to a pound.  Saimen was descent and I'm sure that it's the authentic flavor but my taste is skewed from Aloha Factory in Alhambra's char siu saimen wonton soup.  After eating Saimen in various places, I'm deducing that Aloha Factory's saimen wonton is not authentic but I still love it nonetheless.",

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd certainly go there, but as an out of towner, I don't think I'll make a special trip just to eat there.  I had the Korean chicken, and it was good - the texture was great, and it was extra crispy, but although it had a kick to it, it could have had more of a kick, and it was a little bit too salty.    The macaroni salad was also good, but still within the range of what you'd expect.  The rice, and if you have read my other reviews, I am picky about steamed rice, and here, they had the same issue as I have with  a lot of other places, and that is I found the rice to be too soft, and though I ate 75% of the two large scoops, I was not able to eat it all.   I sampled some fries and I thought they were your everday run of the mill \"thick\" fries.   On the specials menu, they had cucumber kim chee for $2.00.  The taste was good, but we only got like a small sampler cup full, which would be about 1 1/2 banchan dishes at a Korean restaurant.   Overall, the food was filling and enjoyable; the service was friendly, the people are nice.",

    "text": "Hands down: one of the best things to ever happen to Las Vegas!  I seriously got on YELP and was browsing through all of Island Flavors pictures because I miss the food so!  The orders for our party: Oxtail soup, chicken katsu, kalbi short ribs, and shoyu chicken. When those orders came out, my jaw dropped! The portions are huge! Everything was flavorful and delicious. I have a grand feeling that everything on that menu is just as delicious as the meal I had that night.   Now, what really made me cry tears of joy was the kona coffee mud pie. That thing is huge! It easily fed our party of 4. The yummy coffee ice cream, whipped cream, oreo cookie crust and macadamia nuts was marvelous!   The service was also great! She was friendly and made sure to serve us with a smile.   Island Flavor, you won a place in this girl's heart!!",

    "text": "I have come to this establishment a numerous amount of times, and swore i had wrote a review, but when I went to \"update\" my review, I see now that it looks as if I haven't!  As always, the staff is friendly. Me and two of my best girlfriends went around 1 in the afternoon. It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, so finding a seat was not hard at all.   It didn't take long for our waitress to get our drink orders, and bring it in a timely matter. I've noticed tho, that the prices has gone up quite a bit since the last time I was here a couple years ago. I was about to order the usual mix plate when I noticed the Daily Specials Menu placed inside the Menu Booklet.   Menu Specials when I went there Last Week... My Order: Kalua Luau. side order of sweet potato with sesame sauce Friend 1: Furikake Chicken  Friend 2: Pork Chop (on regular menu)   The kalua luau was good, its different type of luau to my family luau. Our luau is more creamier, but this one was a bit more on the roughage green leafy side. But it was still so ono. I opted for brown rice and it also comes with mac salad. THe mac salad was a little too \"mayonaisy\" for me, but if my palate didn't change since i moved from the rock ten years ago, it would've been right up my alley! I ordered up a side of cooked sweet potato and the dipping sauce was divine. Just a great amount of sweet and salty to compliment the potato.   The Furikake CHicken was broke the mouth. As much as i LOVED the Luau, I was picking the chicken off my friends plate just as much as she was picking the luau off of mines. We should've just switched our plates. I was under the impression it was a full chicken breast, but they came out as nuggets. Sweet and savory, with bits of furikake all over! Now i'm not a big fan of any kind of fried chicken, but I couldn't control my hand. It kept reaching over to her plate to grab more!  A definite must try!!   Last but not least, the pork chops with smothered onions. Now what is NOT to like from this all time favorite. Now I've had charbroiled pork chops, teriyaki pork chops, char siu pork chops, apple pork chops, etc. But I love having just a regular, salt and pepper seasoned home style pork chops once in a while. That brought it all home. It was served with two scoops of white rice and a side salad with your choice of dressing.   I didn't opt out for dessert this trip, but from previous visits, I do recommend the Chantilly cake and the Banana Bread Pudding! I tried the Kona Coffee Mud Pie, but when I got it, it was just a oreo crust with three inch high of ice cream and stuff drizzled all over it. Not exactly what I call a mud pie, but it was delicious as just Kona coffee ice cream! (It was still Ono! )   I hope to be back soon!!!",

Almost...almost...makes me forget I'm in the desert and instead right back at home. :) What's cool is the guy who runs it is from the Big Island. So if anyone is going to do local food right in Vegas, it's going to be this guy.  My friends had mixed reviews, but I've not been disappointed. I stick with the teri chicken or the chicken katsu loco moco. Always large portions.The only thing I would recommend if you don't like to drink gravy, is to ask for it on the side. They give a BEEEEEEEEG vat of gravy. :)   Depending if there's room, you can't go wrong with the mud pie or haupia cake. YUM!  And of course, when paying the bill at the counter grabbing a spam musubi for the road. Good local eats when I'm away from home.",

I also opted for the brown rice and it was so overcooked and mushy almost like mashed potatoes. I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. Definitely not a place I would recommend since the quality is so low. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes, but how do you mess up grilled chicken, short ribs and rice? Big FAIL!",

I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door.   Today's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance.   After the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us.   Finally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize!   My blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape. I about had it so I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door made me lose my appetite!",

Noteworthy: After an amazing diner here, I miscalculated my bill total after adding in tip (I blame the always imminent food coma).

We weren't impressed with the food, which took a long time to come out. I got chicken katsu and short ribs with fried rice and Mac salad. I loved my short ribs, slightly tough and overdone but so delicious and full of flavor. The chicken katsu was mediocre and not the best I've had but it wasn't terrible. Mac salad tasted more plain than usual but I finished it anyway. My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken. I didn't get a chance to try it but he definitely voiced not liking it. I definitely would not recommend the fried rice. It did not taste anything like fried rice, which to me ALWAYS tastes the same. I couldn't even eat it. It was literally rice saturated in soy sauce. It had some pork pieces in it which were okay but we couldn't stomach the overwhelming flavor of soy sauce (and FYI we always put soy sauce on our rice anyway)... I think it is a cool place to check out, other people seem to have enjoyed the food, however we will not be returning.",

Multiple parties were sat down after us and the server put us on the backburner and went on to take other parties' order before ours. On their defense, I will say they were very understaffed but that doesn't call for crappy service. Server even bad mouthed a product that is sold here. Overall food is great and portions are great but I highly recommend you take your food to go because the service is absolutely crappy. Great customer service should stay consistent ALWAYS.

Then the roasted pork was so salty & dry. DOUBLE YUCK. We also ordered the Korean chicken wings, they were okay, that's it & the pork fried rice was bland & funky tasting. There was plenty of food, but it was horrible. We figured they may be able to redeem themselves with the Haupia cake.... .nope, it sucked too.

The terms \"broke da mouth\" or \"ono\" are used when you have consumed foods that are so delicious, full of flavor that you can eat it till you go into \"polynesian paralasys\" hahahaha! This place cooks and serves their food as if they were still back on the island, plated with \"choke\" (lots) of food and with lots of local flavors.  All the other restaurants out there in vegas attemp to serve you what they call \"hawaiian bbq\" but Island Flavor doesnt sell theirselves to be a bbq spot, they stick to their name and serve you exactly what you want, Hawaiian food and more. The best Kalbi, well-done everytime and their chantilly and haupia cakes are just like home, maybe even better. Poke is fresh and the loco-moco's, three scoop rice, huge hamburger patty and choke gravy witht the mac, winner! Go in for the authentic Hawaiian plate on a friday or saturday night when they have live hawaiian music. Very laid back, everybody is family; auntie, cousin, uncle. You wont be disappointed",

These are real Hawaiian from Kona they tell me. This is not like the other places that are mostly Korean owned. This place takes pride in their food and it shows. The Kalbi ribs and fried shrimp is what was suggested. The owner hand cuts the ribs himself and marinades them. He said he never freezes the meat so its always fresh. The shrimp is hand cut and breaded with furikake sprinkled on it. I haven't had Hawaiian food this good since I was there last year. I kept driving by this place cause it by the house and now I'm glad I stopped in to try. I will be back.",

What makes it Hawaiian is the workers.  They're all probably from there and just seeing them interact makes you feel you're back at the islands.  I don't know what it is but the aura they give off is very authentic.  Of course, its really good food.  Reminds me of a Hawaiian place I ate at back in Maui.",

After a long day of hiking at Red Rock, hubby and I stopped by here for dinner. When you walk in, you're not immediately greeted. Instead I got the feeling that you're supposed to be like family and seat yourself. The environment is pretty laid back. I actually felt like I was in Hawaii.  I ordered a combo with Korean short ribs and Hawaiian style pork. It included a fat piece of the tender pork and 5 pieces of short ribs. SO good and  very very very generous portions. Flavor was all there. I didn't touch the two scoops of rice. Macaroni salad was typical.  Hubby ordered short ribs and katsu. Katsu was well fried with a crispy outside.  I would definitely come back here again.

I think their oxtail soup is as good as it gets when you don't want to trek to Downtown and visit the Cal. Honestly I feel the oxtail is much better here than the Cal. ;) Portion size is everything here, so you get what you pay for that's for sure.  Now this place is located near Rhodes Ranch. I would say that 90% of their business is take out so the restaurant is never really busy. But if you do decide to eat there, it's a pretty laid-back place no fancy decorations. The owners add their own personal touch but displaying pictures of friends and family on the wall.",

On the mixed plates, they were generous but BF ordered Teri beef and portion was small.  Laulau had lots of meat but missed the taste of the butterfish that you get back home. Ahi poke was very fresh.  Korean chicken wings were not crispy. Macaroni salad disappointing. Service is slow and waitress is missing the aloha spirit. Prices are higher than the other Hawaiian food places.  Would return there again for the poke but for the rest of the menu...I can find it closer to home.",

Everyone should take full advantage of it!   Food was simply AMAZING! This place will not let you down and I definitely will be back!  KOREAN CHICKEN: I HiGhLy recommend the Korean Chicken. Although this place is Hawaiian based, do NOT be discouraged by the word 'Korean' on the menu you will NOT be disappointed. The Korean Chicken is coated fried chicken wings with some flavorful meat that will burst in your mouth! I kid you not my first bite was over the top!   FURIKAKE SHRIMP: I also tried the shrimp which was part of my plate combo...It was also pretty good but nothing to rave about.. I think I'll stick to my tempura shrimp at the Japanese restaurants. But do not be discouraged about trying it I am extremely picky when it comes to shrimp!  TERIYAKI CHICKEN: It was also pretty good although I'm not too much of a fan of teri chicken in general. I personally get tired of it easily after a few bites. You need not worry about the flavor here as well, the teriyaki sauce is glazed with generous amounts all over and the portions once again are tremendous.  PORK WON TONS: Pretty good way to start off the meal although not necessary because you will be full by any of the plates that you order. Pretty much your typical fried won ton complimented with the sweet chili sauce that kicked it up a notch.  MAC SALAD: ehh the mac salad was nothing special to me I've definitely had better.  So what we gonna have DESSERT or disaster?  Dessert was definitely not a disaster... the portions are very generous in this aspect as well... definitely something to share.  MANGO ICE CREAM: Hmm couldn't know how to describe this but it being mango ice cream. It's so hard to pin point what I can compare this to because any mango ice cream I've ever tried is always so different in taste, yet always delicious. It came with about 3-4 scoops of ice cream.  KONA COFFEE PIE: This delectable dessert was great! Especially me being a fan of coffee ice cream... the slice was huge and the consistency of the ice cream was perfect.   TROPICAL ICE TEA: Just to warn you all this is unsweetened. However, on my second refill I asked for 1/2 raspberry ice tea + 1/2 tropical ice tea= an EXCELLENT combo... not too sweet not too bland I would definitely get the same for when I come back!",

What is also bs is that the first time I did not get mac salad.  So the next time I ordered it as a side thinking this was an add on, but later find out that it was supposed to come with the meal.  Portion sizes are big?  Huge portion sizes of crap.  You do not have to be from Hawaii to rate this place as good or bad.  Apparently they are popular, but the food sucks.  Pork Loco Moco - Pork was dried out to the point of cardboard.  Gravy bland and tasteless.  Loco Moco - Whatever they used for the burger was the cheapest ground beef you will ever see.  Looked and tasted like ground up cat food.  Poke - What kind of Hawaiian serves pre-frozen cheap Ahi for poke?  Fried Rice - This was a joke, mushy rice with some sauce mixed in.  Even the egg and sausage didn't help.    Portuguese Bean Soup - Mediocre, tomato soup with too much flour, no smokiness, very disappointing.    Lau Lau - Dried out and tasteless, might as well get the same frozen one from L&L because it is cheaper.  SERVICE - \"Oh my God this is great\"",

When I lived on that side of town I would frequent often because of the thick and juicy Kalbi ribs and big portions. Now that I live further away I get their food delivered from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Froadrunner.com&s=9779c870745162c8dfd0e40df8bf4e25644f8ae298fe597ad8146c7c87c2973c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">roadrunner.com</a>.   My favorites are definitely the oxtail soup, although the flavor isn't consistent. Some days it can be the best oxtail soup I've ever had, and other days not as tasty. Again, they make my favorite Kalbi by far. Their spam musubis are great because they add Furikake to them. Their dessert portions are huuuuuge and delicious especially the guava and chantilly cake.   The Kahlua Pork and the Roast pork are definitely not one of their better dishes. They both lack flavor that I come to expect from hawaiian food and a little on the dry side.   Other than that, I really don't think you can leave this place hungry and anything on the menu. Oh and I forgot to mention, you can get brown rice instead of white. But we all know Hawaiian food always tastes much better with sticky white rice !",

But she was able to tend to our table and a few others, very efficient.  The goods: AMAZING.  I got the mixed plate with teriyaki chicken and furikake shrimp.  i was in heaven.  The meat was so tender and I could just pull it apart with my fork.  Sounds of food ecstasy kept coming from the other side of the table; my friend was really enjoying her meal as well.  And the portions were huge!  We ate a good amount and still had to get a to-go box for the rest of her Kalbi and my chicken.  The atmosphere: It reminded me so much of home.  They had satellite radio playing Hawaiian tunes; a very nice touch.  It wasn't done up all crazy, just a few pictures here and there, a wall fixture of the islands.  It had a very personal feel to it.  It reminded me of places we would eat when I was younger in Waianae; the same fading color scheme and plants, same kitchen layout.  It actually made me quite nostalgic.  After Aloha Grill closed down and Aloha Kitchen kind of went downhill, I thought my only hope for Hawaiian food would be the Marketstreet Cafe at the Cal, and I only go there for the saimin anyway.  But my \"haole\" friend as he refers to himself, instructed that it was CRUCIAL I check out Island Flavor.  I am so happy that I did.  Amazing food, and great quality for the price.  I was afraid it would be more on the pricy side because of other reviews, but that wasn't the case at all.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the bill. First experience there was brilliant, it definitely won't be my last.",

    "text": "I found out about this place through the shining recommendations of my Hawaiian friends. I can't quite agree with their praise, perhaps I'm missing out on some special Hawaiian taste buds, but the experience here is lackluster.   Strangely, the portion sizes were uncharacteristically average, the service was downright cold and bitter, and the food flavor wavered from tasteless to over-seasoned. The saimin had crisp ingredients, but it lacked flavor overall - the broth really was like water, and it was lukewarm. The poke had great fish quality, but it was so over-seasoned with onions and garlic that the quality of the ahi was obscured. The galbi was solid, but just that - good, and nothing more. The saving grace of the day was their perfect guava cake and chantilly cake - nice, generous sizes, and delicious layers of distinct flavor without being cloying.   Thanks to their amazing cakes, I will be rounding the 2.5 stars to a 3. But it's a close call - the service is in serious need of help. We were not greeted by anyone upon entering. The waitress was curt, not very accommodating, and very impatient, and the only warmth I ever saw from her was with the delivery of the check. Pre-tip, that is. While I can't know what she was thinking then, that always makes me suspicious, particularly when the service was so lacking for the rest of the time... And for such a casual, laid-back place, especially a Hawaiian place, the service (and saimin!) should be at the very least warm.",

This is some of the best Hawaiian food I've had in vegas better than aloha kitchen and L&L for sure! Their quality of meat is good hardly any fat or just bone which I get a lot of at aloha kitchen. Ever since I found this place this is where I go for Hawaiian food every time. Their customer service is good too I've never actually ate in the restaurant only Togo but the one time there was something wrong with my order they remade it no questions asked and even let me keep what I already had. Their portions are pretty big the loco moco is bombbbbbb and so is their fried rice!",

Came with a scoop of mac salad and two scoops of rice.  The chicken was perfectly cooked.  Got a wing, drumstick, thigh and breast.  All was tender especially the breast.  I expected the coating to be sweeter but it tasted great anyway.  Everyone in my group loved their food.  Poke was excellent.    They serve a lot of food so prepare to take some home.  Oh, heard the cakes are great.  Heard they are made by the cake store in the same shopping center.  So, take some leftovers home and enjoy the cake.",

A mini mall location, but the food is amazing.  The loco moco came in a soup bowl made for a table for 10!  I had the Korean Fried Chicken - small drums and wings in an amazing sauce.  I swapped the regular rice for fried rice for $2.00 and it may have been the best Hawaiian BBQ fried rice I have ever had.  They obviously make their own BBQ pork (char siu) because the mountain of fried rice had some nice juicy pieces.  It was a flashback to some Sam Choy fried rice where they prop the bacon up on the sides!  I had some of my wife's lomi salmon (great) and the poke (amazingly fresh big chunks of tuna).  If I lived in Vegas, I would travel 20+ minutes to eat here!  Lots of to go orders so this place is not a secret.  Friendly in that island way with good service (even when crowded).

The hours has changed so please be mindful of the new hours of operation.    i went their for lunch since i'm from hawaii I'm always looking for a good place where they have hawaiian food.    I have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my friends and everyone I asked about this place.  i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so I picked teri chicken and roast pork  which is a basic item for hawaiian restaurants.  First their menu is very limited, they didn't even have spam musubi.. anyways.  when they food came out it looked good. Nice big portions just like my firend said.  but when i started eating  the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.  the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.  although the chicken was cooked perfectly, there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..  the rice was over cooked and mushy.  i didn't want to anymore of that so I ordered the saimin.  which is another staple of hawaiian food.  when it came out it looked very nice.  it had wontons, fish cakes, bok choy, teri beef, scrambled egg.  but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.  the soup was a instant soup bases.  the noodle was s&s saimin.  i asked for chinese hot mustard so I can dip the wontons in it.  what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixed together.  right then and there i lost my appetite.  the saimin is not worth the $8.75  you can't have mustard with your saimin.  Oh!! they don't even have Aloha Shoyu..  I would really like to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have hawaiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....",

I did like how the pork was nice and tender though.  Nothing like the fatty pork in Hawaii, but well done for what they have to work with.  They do serve big hawaiian sizes so there was a lot of pork compared to the luau leaves.  The haupia was comfortingly good.  We also had their Portuguese bean soup.  While it isn't like my mom's (my mom's is still the best), it is pretty good.  There is a slight spiciness to it (I didn't notice it at first, but my son did).

Didn't know what to expect, but first bite left me nodding in approval. Son liked the mini chicken katsu plate he ordered. Mac salad was good as well.

Go for it. Fall of the bone goodness.   Places like this will always be a crowd favorite due to the excellent value for your money. To the owners of Island Flavor...I love this place.

Come with an appetite because you will be stuffed because the serving sizes are huge. But no complaints here. If you have room for desert order anything. They are all good but my favorite is the Haupia cake. At first I didn't wanna go but I'm sure glad I gave it a try.",

    "text": "This place has all the local dishes just like back home and their portions are definitely generous! I ordered a local staple, Loco Moco. It was just as good as anything I've eaten back home. I judge Loco Moco by the quality of the brown gravy. Their gravy was the consistency just how I like it, not too thick and not like soup. I ordered my eggs over easy and it was cooked to perfection. As easy as it may sound, many times eggs aren't cooked as actually ordered. I look forward to returning and ordering their kalua pork and cabbage, another local staple. The service was friendly and I recommend this place to try",

    "text": "As I opened the door, a wave of sound exploded in my face unexpectedly. I have never been here before so I didn't think that such a small place can have a live band playing. How awesome is that?! I always wanted to try this place because: 1. It's right around my area, 2. I heard a scrumptious amount of pleasant reviews on the food here, and 3. It's Hawaiian food dude! Unfortunately I could not stay and eat inside the restaurant, but I did get to experience the ambience of the atmosphere while I was waiting for my order that I made to-go.   First thing that caught my eye that made me happy was the size of the portions of the food when I looked around at people's plate. Second thing was that I could order a mix of the two entree! The menu also gave an option for brown rice too, hellyeah. There were other healthier options too in replacement of the macaroni salad, but that is too good to replace. So when I got my order, I bolted over to my friends house and opened my treasure box of satiation. The portion size, good. I like it. I can eat a whole cow and maybe half a horse, yeah it's kind of a curse sometimes. So I got the chicken katsu and half with the chicken teriyaki. I didn't expect the brown rice to be more of a mushy texture, but I didn't really mind it. It went well with the food in my opinion. The chicken was good, chicken teriyaki was good, and the macaroni salad, too good. I also ate the remaining 1/4 of my girlfriend's food cause she didn't finish it. It also came with a sauce; I think it was for the teriyaki but I just used it for everything lol.. It tastes good so why not.   As for the first impression if trying this place, I regret not getting the loco moco to try but there will definitely be a second time.",

I've never had Chantilly cake before and it was ok too but not anything I am dying to have again. Overall everything was GOOD but absolutely not GREAT. Much better than the horrible Hawaiian place in the Vons shopping center but not 5 stars. 3 stars for a very adequate experience but I need quite a bit more for a 5 star review. Sorry.",

I had to get my fave-anywhere I go I always get BEEF TERIYAKI.  I had to try the POKE....three types to choose from and sistah helped me choose the shoyu type.   YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM!  My son chose CHICKEN TERIYAKI and he loved it, also.  Not only did it taste good but  the portions were \"Man-size!\"  We were not able to finish...which is fine so I have a meal for the next day.   My son still was craving some GREEN TEA ice cream and when the bowl came....it was a giant portion.  We are used to getting one scoop when we go to sushi places.    This place will be one of my favorite places to go to from now on.  I still need to try their OXTAIL SOUP....then I will have to update my review.",

Hubby and I have been here several times and it is one of the friendliest restaurants I have ever been to - the service is amazing and you feel like you are your server's only customers even though everytime we have been there the place is rockin' and packed!    Unfortunately I tried L&L before coming here and that experience almost made me not try this wonderful little gem in the southwest.  I know... lumping L&L to all Hawaiian restaurants would be like comparing McDonalds to In-n-Out - my mistake :)  I love the traditional Loco Moco - the gravy is like a culinary orgasm and the eggs are always cooked perfectly!  The hamburger patty is always moist and juicy and the seasoning is perfect too!  It is mind blowing...  Plus they provide so much food (with a side of the best mac salad I've ever had) each time I have had to take over half home with me (and it is just as amazing the next day!)  Hubby gets something different each and every time and he has always been very pleased (and too busy mmmmming to talk much during our meals there!)  Make sure you grab some of their amazing banana nut bread when you are leaving - you will be way too full to have some during your visit...  I was thinking while I was writing this that I should keep my mouth shut and not share my experience - this restaurant may be even more crowded my next visit and when Loco Moco is calling my name - I do not want to wait any longer than absolutely necessary!",

    "text": "This place is definitely a good chowdown place (although in general, Hawaiian places tend to be chowdown places).  When you come here, it is not a fine dining experience. I mean, this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-elastic-band-before-coming kind of food.  There are a couple of things are worth mentioning.   The salads - most notably the fried poke and teriyaki chicken salad are excellent. It's hard to get tuna cooked right - meaty, tender red on the inside, seared perfectly on the outside. Those luscious cubes of fish really made this dish shine. Grilled teriyaki chicken thighs had a nice char on the outside without making it too dry. Perfection. Served on a bed of romaine with a side of tomato, cucumber, purple sweet potato  and fried wonton chips- this salad is not a light affair with its creamy sesame dressing. Normally, I order this salad with the dressing on the side and leave most of the chips next to it.  Chicken katsu was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. The amount given is rather astounding - 3 fillets served with scoops of rice and macaroni salad. (One of our friends who loves to eat very light, was addicted to the macaroni salad. It was like watching a crack addict after a long period of abstinence.)  Steak and onions were packed with flavour. The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to a medium to medium rare.  The only thing I didn't find that appetizing was their roasted pork dish. The gravy was overwhelming although the pork did have a nice flavour to it. If it wasn't for the gravy, the dish would have been infinitely better.  Portions are really big - bring friends. I'm serious. 3 dishes could easily feed 4 really hungry people or 5 not-so-hungry people.",

I wanted my cabbage on the side instead of having it under my chicken and charged me for kimichi cabbage AND when the food came out.. it wasn't correct. No refills. Took my food to go and wanted a sauce for my chicken and again, was going to charge me and insisted I got the sauce barely left over in my sauce ramekin. Will be finding a new Hawaiian place. I drive here for 40 minutes or more, but the service is always bad. Not worth the drive anymore. I use to recommend this place to everyone.

I ate there again today for the first time since the new owners made changes to the restaurant.   First thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was the plain gray walls with no pictures on them. There were  3 TVs showing pictures of food. There was music playing but it was generic hawaiian music. Knowing the atmosphere of the previous ownership, the new decor seemed cold and generic. They got rid of the market and expanded the seating are which I felt was a plus.    The food portions are noticeably smaller than the previous ownership and the new ownership seemed like it removed some items from the menu. I was disappointed as my daughter was told they didn't have any Hawaiian Sun POG.Hawaiian Sun is on the menu but I didn't know if they were all out or they didn't carry that flavor anymore. They were also out of Arizona Tea.  The quality of the food appears to be the same.   I gave them 3 stars because Island Flavor seems to have lost some of the little things that made it feel like being back home in Hawaii and because of the noticeably smaller portions. Hopefully the food quality doesn't change because right now that is the only thing that has stayed the same from previous ownership. I want even going to try the Poke under the new ownership since the new owner couldn't pronounce it correctly in a video I watched after the new ownership introduced themselves.",

    "text": "Like others have stated, this is the best place to get your Hawaiian fix. Although I haven't been to Hawaii yet, I was told that it's the closest you'll get on the 9th island.  Portions are massive here. So massive that even an appetizer can get you full (well for me it can)- but even that wouldn't stop me from over ordering every time I'm here. The Tuna Poke with Furikake is AMAZING so be sure to start every meal with that, the entrees are all good (I always tend to get the mixed plate with Steak & Onions and Kalbi Ribs- also comes with a side of rice and Mac salad) while the boyfriend feasts on his Loco Moco with sunny side up eggs and a side of Spam Musubi since this place makes it the best according to him.   I'll admit that I haven't ventured out to try new things since I'm always craving that one thing every time I visit, but I'm sure it's all good nonetheless. The reason I knocked down a star is that I used to be OBSESSED with their Haupia (coconut) Cake only to find out that it doesn't taste the same; perhaps a change in bakeries I guess. To what was once creamy, light and fluffy now tastes overly rich, gelly (with a lot of gelatin substances) and heavy.   The hospitality is amazing here too. Everyone do love spreading the \"aloha\" around to make you feel like you're at home, or that you've known them forever.",

Authentic Hawaiian family atmosphere.   I've gone here twice already and was never disappointed with the food. A friend and I shared the Mixed Plate with Kalbi short ribs and Furikake chicken: WOW. Seriously.   Any plate can be split between two people or you can take a little bit of Hawaii home with you. And the dessert! I think it's called the lava cake...anyway, it's stacked! Must have and share. Even their green tea ice cream is yummy.  My last visit was on Sunday, March 1. For whatever reason, when we first walked in, it was hot and stuffy in the restaurant. While waiting for a table to become available, I actually had to step outside to catch a breather, but when we actually sat down, the temperature dropped and I got cold. When I went to wash my hands in the women's restroom, I felt like I needed my jacket whereas my guy friends said it was like a sauna in the guys' bathroom. Weird.

I'll probably still go here because it's close, but will probably start trying the newer establishments. Heard there is no management, which probably contributed to the change in portion and size.",

My fault for not looking first, but I am very rarely charged an automatic gratuity for 6 people and I would know because we eat out quite a bit.  So I ended up paying a 40% tip - sorry, the service is not that great.  I had forgotten my credit card so went back the next day to get it and when I brought it up they said there wasn't anything they could do about it since the bill had already been run the previous day.

Lots of rice tho! The ratio of rice was too great for me, but the handmade party tasted delicious. The Chicken Katsu was also a new take on the loco Moco, husband liked it.  Kona coffee is amazing and it comes with free refills! Delicious. Must take advantage.   We also ordered a side of macaroni salad. There is something about Hawaiian macaroni salad that trumps the store brands ones. We can't place it, but the one they have here are definitely a must-try!",

Just love it when I hear local transplants talking pidgin to da max(NOT the bird!) and KCCN is playing on the stereo. Makes me feel I've never left home.  perusing the specials, I come across something that is only found on Maui(up until now) Guri Guri(pronounced goodie goodie) which is basically sherbet. I asked Aunty if its made, or if they got it from Maui, and she says \"Nice try bruddah, I not gonna tell you!\" LOL!!!!..they offer Strawberry and Blue Vanilla and for $4 it comes in a half-pound size poke container...That's dessert, but back to the food....  We got The Fried Rice Omelette and Furikake Shrimp and they were Onolicious as usual. Can't go wrong with any of the food here, just come with an appetite because one entree could seriously feed two people.  Still wanting dessert, we were gonna get the Haupia Cake but it wasn't on the menu. what they did have was a Haupia Ice Cream Pie, so we tried that and also got a Strawberry Guri Guri. The Pie was okay, but not as good as a cake and the Guri Guri was good, but slightly harder from being prepacked. Service here is always great, everyone checks up on you and always making you feel welcome...ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(5/100) \"Get Your Guri Guri Here!\"",

My friend then went up to get two drinks, and it took them 10 minutes to get them for her and ring her up. Then it took 15 more minutes to get the food. We were there for 25 minutes waiting.  Food: poke was too salty. Too much soy sauce. Can't even taste the fish. The pork plate my friend got was good, she said, so that's good, I guess.  I'd rather go to Ohana across the street.

No where in town are you going to get big island style Hawaiian food and they even have ox tail soup seven days a week?! No place in town has that?!? Everything from the teriyaki beef to the furikake chicken, this place  never ceases to satisfy. A lot of Hawaiian places seem to give you the normal low-grade teriyaki beef but this place makes teriyaki beef the way it should be! simple delicious hearty and more importantly should represent the flavor of the Islands. I had an order that didn't come out very well because I ordered it last minute on a Saturday night. It wasn't very edible because it was the end of the day food, and I called the next day to let them know that I wasnt satisfied and they made sure that I got the same meal waiting for me when I went down to pick it up at no additional cost. This is the meaning of customer service!!! I love this place and would recommend that anyone who wants to try Hawaiian food here in Las Vegas make a trip to Island flavor!",

    "text": "It's hard to ignore raving reviews claiming the best Hawaiian food in town (of course, I was skeptical). I haven't found a single place that emulates the Hawaiian dining experience I miss about home. I understand the appeal of Island Flavor with its large portions and seemingly bold flavors, however, it's simply not comparable to Hawaii eats (specifically, Oahu). Surprisingly, it's not even the best Hawaiian food I've had in Las Vegas.  The Spam Musubi was good. They add sauce and furikake around the spam and have an acceptable rice-to-spam ratio. I'm not a fan of adding other flavors, especially sweet, to my Spam Musubi, but this was subtle enough to still enjoy it.  The poke was sad. I ordered a pound of their Shoyu Ahi Poke (MP; $14.50) and I was rather disappointed. There was way too much soy sauce (yes, this is possible) and it made the poke salty. Also, the ingredients didn't have enough time to mingle their flavors together and the raw onions were too sharp (and I love raw onions). All things that could possibly have been avoided had the poke been made earlier. This is one of the worst poke I've eaten.  For my entree, I got a Mixed Plate with Kalua Pig & Cabbage and Furikake Chicken ($11.25), plus Fried Rice (add $2). I normally wouldn't order something like Furikake Chicken, but it seems to be a favorite here. It's deep-fried boneless chicken tossed in a Furikake glaze. Pretty tasty, albeit salty, but not something I desire to eat again. The Kalua Pig was so MEH. The pork was slightly dry and it needed A LOT more of that Hawaiian salt. This is one of my benchmark dishes since it's a personal favorite and this one made me very sad. The silver lining is that the pork and cabbage helped cut the saltiness of everything else! I'm torn about their fried rice. It's not the Hawaiian-style fried rice I was yearning or expecting, BUT it has an appeal. I don't like the prominent and slightly overbearing soy sauce flavor of their fried rice, however, it was still enjoyable (as long as I forget my Hawaiian-style expectation).  I also tried the Furikake Shrimp and Kalbi. I'm almost certain the shrimp is the frozen breaded type tossed with Furikake after frying. Shrug. The Kalbi, on the other hand, was pretty good!  Yes, the portions are HUGE. You can definitely share a mixed plate (especially with that enormous addition of fried rice) with two people and still be stuffed. Service was wonderful. All three servers on the floor helped us (yay teamwork!) and were extremely attentive - though they didn't refill waters.  Although there were many disappointments, I wouldn't write off future visits (must try other favorites) and I need to try their desserts!",

    "text": "I have to say among the Hawaiian places I've tried all over the valley... This bar far is the most and most authentic! Portion sizes are huge and more than enough to eat there be full and take plenty home. I've had the Korean garlic chicken, the hamburger loco moco, Katsu chicken loco moco, kalbi spare ribs and the spamasubi. I have never been disappointed food wise.   The place on the outside looks nothing short of standard and not anything special or impressive at all. It's rather spacious inside and average amount of seating for a family owned establishment. It's always a good sign when you see islanders eating coz you know the food is legit. Always people in here eating and always at least someone from Hawaii inside enjoying the grub there.   The most recent time I went tho, I have to say the service was on the poor side. Granted, it was really busy that day, but we waited for our check and refill on drink from at least ten minutes. A server or cook from the back came out to help seat people and saw someone she knew eating and got caught up talking to that table for a while. We kept trying to get her attention until finally the customer that was talking to this server told US that WE should just go up to the counter to get someone's attention... Excuse me?! Poor form. That person should told the employee \"hey we'll talk later you have customers\" and directed her to us.! So naw we sat there and waited. And poor form on that server for having a ten minute conversation with a table when the placed is packed and we can't get anyone to notice that we want the check and to go boxes to dip outta there.   Normally neglect of service is something I hold highly to food and dining establishments and take off a whole star for that. But dam this place is so bomb with the food... I'll let that one time slide. The customer service can make or break a dining experience for a person. And if the service is exceptional or good like it's supposed to be... It can sometimes make the meal all the more enjoyable. Tighten up on that customer service... Then it's top notch best Hawaiian food in town.",

I told 3 different folks there how many people were in my party and was still kept waiting to be seated an inordinate amount of time (there were empty tables BTW).  I was within seconds of leaving when they finally seated my party.  Once my party ordered we got the food quickly, but once we were ready to pay it took forever to get the check and then another forever to get somebody to the cash register to actually take the money.  And while that was happening the line to be seated was growing fast.  They seemed very disorganized.  Again, the food was great, but due to this horrible service I won't be back.",

    "text": "I would drive all the way back to Las Vegas, just to come eat here!   It was such a random find...we were driving to Vegas and I was really craving some poke and somehow found this place because it was still open by the time we reached the area.   Located off the strip, in a small strip mall with plenty of parking. Upon walking in, I knew we were going to have a nice hawaiian meal. Almost everyone there was hawaiian and there was a guy singing and playing his ukelele.   First and foremost, the service here is beyond amazing! The lady running the place is the sweetest. She's fast and efficient, makes great suggestions and she cares so much about her food!   And the food...oh my goodness!!!! So yummy. We ordered the shoyu poke as an appetizer. And it was such a large amount...I definitely had my poke fix: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=liUDL0_QkxmQ6GZwxsd8YA&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I ended up ordering the chicken furikake, which I've never had before but it was suggested: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p_62gNsitkBL2YWYKZDETw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> It was probably the best thing I've ever had in a long while. It was so good!!!   My sasquatch ordered the kalbi short ribs: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hvuk6dldYcVr1aajI25Rrw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> He was so hungry he started eating them quickly. The nice lady who was running the place saw that the short rib was slightly undercooked. She was so concerned, even though he didn't mind much. And she ended up putting in a nicely cooked new piece into our to-go boxes. She was so sweet.   So definitely it was a 5 star experience for me. The food. The service. It's worth the drive! I miss this place already and wish there was something like this in LA!",

The vibe in this place is similar to what you'll feel back on the islands. Very welcoming, but full of energy and a lot of other folks from Hawaii. They can get pretty busy, so seating might be tough. I like their loco moco here, but I get the oxtail most of the time! Been meaning to try their furikake chicken and I will sometime soon! Haven't gone here a lot because it is quite the drive from my house. The pricing is your usual $9-$20 range, but they give good portions! Back at home I was used to the generous portions... they definitely live up to it! If you live on this side and crave local food give this place a try! Promise you will like it.",

I seem to be coming to this place at a weekly visit, when I'm not busy. The commute here is a distance... But it's worth it when you have their infamous furukaki chicken! The waiters/waitresses are very knowledgeable about the menu, and they suggest that you try something that you've never tried. Leilani is always there, and loves to joke and make trouble. Each item that they bring out the kitchen window seems to draw every patrons eyes! Not to mention their portions!   Their kal-bi is awesome, and I never did like beef stew as a child, yet, these guys managed to change my mind! It's delicious! I love their Portuguese bean soup, and their fried noodles! I always gawk at their fried rice omelette with the Portuguese sausage. It's a inverted large bowl of fried rice! I believe I've tried a fraction of their menu, and the items that I've chosen so far aren't a disappointment!   Then there is the DESSERT.... Even though some of the items come from next door which is a bakery, the Hawaiian desserts are top notch!! Guava cake, Cocoa Puffs.... etc... To die for! I think I'm heading there next week again!",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated right away.  Our waitress was super friendly, she was busy but laid back, felt like home (Hawaii). The menu was filled with so many familiar options it was hard to choose. My husband ordered Kalbi and my cousin, her husband and I ordered a mixed plate with furikaki fried shrimp and hawaiian style roast pork. Both came with rice (I had brown) and Mac salad. We also ordered fresh made Ahi Poke, mix of shoyu, sesame, and furikake style.  Everything was sooooooo delicious!!! My husband (whose from CA) was laughing at me because he said he has never seen me get so excited and enjoy my meal so much before. After dinner I was so full but could not leave without getting a slice of guava cake! They also had chantili cake and coco puffs which I wanted but could not eat because I was stuffed. We got the guava cake and it did not disappoint! It was so good I kept eating even though I felt like I was going to explode!   We will definitely be back when we are in town again! Enjoyed the entire experience from the friendly staff, the hawaiian music playing in the background, the local feel and the food!",

The Spam Musubi had a layer of seasoned seaweed sprinkles on the spam which gave it a little more flavor.  This was of the best Kalbi Short Ribs that I have had in a Hawaiian restaurant in Las Vegas. There were 4 thick, tender, juicy, perfectly grilled slices of Kalbi.  Just a little fatty.  It came with a steak knife.  The Kalbi was on a bed of rice and raw cabbage with a scoop of rice and macaroni salad on the plate.  The macaroni salad was good.

The menu has all your typical dishes and a couple  of poke variations . I  Ordered the poke , loco loco, and kalua pork . My plate also came with a Mac salad and coconut haupia pudding cup . oN point! I wish Seattle had Hawaiian places like this. Sigh. Next time I'm in vegas, this place is a must .",

    "text": "The BF and I were near a friends house and about to beer fest so we needed some food to buffer it.   We shared a combo plate of Korean chicken and the Hawaiian pork w/ gravy (which we added a egg to make it into a loco moco). The korean chicken are crispy little wings and drumlettes with a really tasty sweet and tangy sauce. That would be awesome if you can order a bucket of these like how chicken wings places serve it because we could definitely eat more of these. The pork wasn't shredded like I expected but slices off a big roast. It was a bit dry, but the flavor was pretty good. Wish we ordered just the Korean chicken, but we've never been here so wanted to try more than one thing. The serving was plentiful for both of us so the portions here on the heavy side of things.   I read a lot of positive reviews for their cakes so we decided to get a Haupia cake. That was really delicious. the layers of cake was moist and light, had a good custard, nice coconut flavor that wasn't overpowering. If this was a place near our house I think I would come more often for cake than food.   The server was full of Hawaiian hospitality and checked on us often.   I can see why people like this place but it is far for us to ever make a point of coming here more than once in a while. If you're in the SW area though, this is better places to eat in the neighborhood.",

The chop steak with onion was a little tough but very good as well. I also got a chance to try the kalbi here and I would get that next time along with katsu if choosing options for the mix plate.  I didn't know it's not listed on the menu, but you can order coffee here! It's pretty good and comes with free refills.  Excellent service, reminiscent of the hospitality of the islands.",

I ordered a mixed plate combo with furikake chicken and teriyaki chicken. The plate comes with 2 scoops of white rice, and a side of mac salad. I also added on 2 orders of spam musubi. My total was $18.49. Island Flavor is located in BFE aka Durango and Windmill, right next to World Of Cakes.   The food was really good. The furikake chicken was something I have never had before but I enjoyed it. It's chicken pieces breaded then deep fried and tossed in a sweet sauce and sprinkled with furikake. Something new for my taste buds for sure. The teriyaki chicken was okay. The problem was it was literally swimming in teriyaki sauce and it was sooo salty. I love teriyaki sauce, but would for sure ask for the sauce on the side next time. Especially since I had leftovers. Reheated teriyaki gets thick and goopy, and is not the business. The spam musubi were decent size and still tasted good the next day. They wrapped em in saran wrap so all I had to do was pop it in the microwave and I was good to go. I enjoyed the mac salad. It was creamy and just about perfect, but I did add a dash of salt and pepper to it. All in all, everything was pretty ONOLICIOUS!   This is not an area I am in often, but when I am in the area and craving Hawaiian food, I will stop in.",

Literally minutes after writing the previous one star review I got a message from the owner Bruce.  He was so kind and apologetic that he offered to give us a full refund on said dinner.  He continued to guarantee that all of his food is prepared fresh daily and that the turn over on food is so quick that food never sits.  I believed him.  This particular situation prompted him to look deeper into the problem as far as checking in with vendors that supply his restaurant to try and find the source of the problem.    Due to the overwhelming amount of concern, professionalism and care that he has given me and my friends...I think I'm gonna write this off as a fluke accident.  It happens to the best of em. Besides that Furikake chicken is too good to ignore!    Again, thank you Bruce for the amazing customer service and I definitely won't give up on Island Flavor.",

    "text": "I'm from Hawaii. I might say the plate lunch I had at Island Flavor might be better than most places in Honolulu? wha? sacrilege?  Ok, they don't have fountain fanta fruit punch (which has a strawberry accent) like in Hawaii... but everything else--delicious.  The service is of a local flavor--the friendly kind. I wanted to try two things not typically ordered together, and the waitress was super flexible about it.  Yes!  The teri beef was delicious--and if it was salty--i only noticed it after the meal. But what I most appreciated was that it had a good char from the grill they have in the kitchen. Also, the cut of meat was not tender in itself (skirt or ny?) but it was handled perfectly. It had both a solid beefy taste and with the slices of meat going across the grain, each piece was mouth tender. It was a beautiful, expert touch. The teri sauce was solid--not like mainland style teriyaki--but local flavor. The sweet sour spareribs--also quite good--a tiny bit oily. big piece of ginger, and turnips, carrots--it was good and hearty--like what you'd make at home.  not as good as the teri beef though. I ended up finishing all the teri beef and taking the SSS home. And PS--it tasted great as leftovers later that night. mac salad was solid Haupia cake--also world class. Reminiscent of Napoleans (Zippy's) in terms of the lightness of the cake.  I would not be surprised if the owner's used to run that bakery or someplace like that. All that cake for only $5!    I'm so full again. Two meals in from one plate lunch (and a piece of cake)  Clearly these people know what they're doing. I have to really search to give any suggestions at all: * Is it possible to make slightly better rice?  Pressure cooker might make the rice stand out too? The steamed rice scoops were pretty dense and was the weakest part of the meal.  * I found myself waiting to pay for quite a while at the register.  It'd be nice if the wait staff took the payment--but hey, I won't complain.",

My wife ordered the friend noodle special (Tuesday).  This is quite possibly the best friend noodle/saimin I have ever tried.  It's loaded with Cha Siu, Kamaboko, spam and topped with grilled Chicken Teriyaki.    After talking to the owner, I ordered the Furikake Chicken which was fabulous.  It was crispy and full of flavor.  I also enjoyed the scoop of Mac Salad as well.  In fact, the flavors here are as big as their portions \"BIG\".  I'm going to have to try their Kalbi Ribs upon my next visit.    I wanted to order the Guava Cake or Mud Pie for dessert, but I was just too full.  I guess that will have to wait til my next trip as well.",

The 2nd reason is \"Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs\". :)  This is a local favorite. \"Island Flavor\" is not on the Strip. The waitress told us that they have been in this location for about 8 years. I'm glad Dave found \"Island Flavor\".  We ate here twice during a 10-day stay, in Las Vegas. I ordered the Furikake Chicken and Poke both times. Absolutely delicious.   Don't think, too much...just order the Furikake Chicken and Poke...Oh wait !!!!...then, make room for the To-Die-For Guava Cake!!!!!!!!!!!! If you can't make room for the Guava Cake, no problem. That means that there's more for me. :D  The Guava Cake and the Chocolate Cake look really delicious, but heavy. Surprisingly, both cakes are very light...and flavorful.  It is definitely worth the Uber or rental-car ride to have a wonderful meal at this restaurant.",

We ordered two mixed plates. One with furikake chicken and Kalua pig & Cabbage. The other with kalbi short ribs and chopped steak and onions.   After staring at photos of furikake chicken for years, my dream came True and was able to try it. Honestly, was a bit diappointed in the taste which is like something  you get a Chinese restaurant without the furikake. The Kalua pig and cabbage lacked the saltiness and smoked flavor you typically get. So, that was diappointing as well. The portions weren't a disappointment. Large enough to feed 2 people with mac salad. Can't believe I almost finished my plate. Oink..    The kalbi short ribs were just like most. Good but not great. The chopped steak was decent and had a slight sweetness to it (sugar).   Wish I had space or made space for desserts. The guava and chantilly cakes looked pretty good.   Service here was just average and appeared shorthanded on a busy Sunday afternoon.   I'll stick to Aloha Specialties next time for my garlic chicken.",

The furikake was okay, I'm used to a more tender chicken that has crunch, but this one tasted like it was just over cooked chicken with a soy glaze sauce. I still ate it because some parts were good and not so dry. The Mac salad is how it should be, I grew up eating L&L mac salad so if it's not better than that then it is what it is. Lastly the guava cake was mediocre at best, I thought it was way too dry and the flavor seemed off. Maybe they gave us old cake? I heard how good it was but it did not exceed my expectation. I will come back for them short ribs",

The inside is kinda small but the food well worth coming here. On Fridays there's a family of 3 that sings which is awesome. Everything we've tried here is great from the appetizers of the poke took the desert. Everything is very big portion sized. My husband go to drink is their fruit punch. I like the pog juice since it's something I grew up drinking. When I'm with my husband we usually get the mixed plate since the portions are so big and we add Mac salad so we each can have one. My go to is their chicken Katsu and my husband likes to get the Kalbi or furikake chicken.   They do get busy sometimes and the wait could get long. The service is great though. I've brought my parents here and they loved it. Overall, we love this place and come back every so often.",

Recently, I haven't been into the super fried chicken because it doesn't make very good leftovers, so I recommend sharing it because the portions are huge!   I knocked off a star for the furikake shrimp. I was hoping for the same type of flavor, but the shrimp didn't really have any flavor and most of whatever flavor you get is from the chili sauce you dip it in. At first i thought the shrimp wouldn't be enough but I just got tired of trying to eat it and didn't finish it. I was kind of disappointed and wish I tried the loco loco katsu, but atleast I don't have to wonder about the shrimp!  You can never go wrong with a loco moco though!",

This is the hawaiian family originally from Big Island's favorite. That itself should say something to whoever is looking at this.   This last time we were a 8 top and service, bless her heart, was a lot on the slow side. It's ok-we forgive since the food was so ono.   I had the Kalbi & Katsu plate. Both ono. The kalbi was cooked perfect and can't complain about the Katsu.   Get the coffee.  Get the Guava cake.  Be aloha.   Do it.",

Walked in, and as always, was greeted by a friendly worker and seated right away.  Service was friendly and quick.  Ordered our food and it was out within 10 minutes.  Food came out hot and fresh.  I had the Loco Moco.  Perfectly cooked rice.  Thick Beef patty was juicy and nicely seasoned.  I ordered over easy eggs but came out hard, no biggie...  And the gravy, Can't get enough of that stuff.....  I wish they offered the B.I.G. Loco Moco.  Choice of 3 different meats!  Wife got the Saimin.  Standard Saimin with the usual toppings.  Char-sui, kamaboko, eggs, green onions, etc....  The broth was a bit under seasoned.  Nothing a little shoyu couldn't fix.   The dumplings were good though....  Daughter got the furikake chicken.  She usually pounds her food but she barely touched it.  I finally tried a piece and it was hard and dry.  It's as if it was cooked, sat out, then refried to heat it up.  The sauce was good.  Son had the Korean Wings.  This is his go to plate.  He always orders it and it's always BOMB!!!!  Big freshly cooked chicken wings and dipped in a nice shoyu/sesame sauce.  Perfect every time.....",

I'm a beginner when it comes to Hawaiian dishes, but so far I'm quite impressed. I had their Hawaiian style pork with gravy as well as terriaki chicken, with rice and mac as the side.   It was both filling and satisfying--the pork being the highlight of the meal. The rice was a perfect texture and complimented everything. A complete dish that will have me coming back for so much more in the future.",

They just need more servers. Although the server we had was nice. After almost an hour getting our food. Initially food was good while eating it (maybe because I was hungry and I had 2 kids to feed), towards the end I had a horrible taste of waaaay too much sodium in my mouth. I order 2 combo plates. Kalbi and Korean chicken with fried rice. It might've been from the Kalbi ribs or fried rice. Because I enjoyed the korean chicken. I seriously had a huge headache after and literally the rest of my day was ruined. I had a bad salty feel all day. I felt my face blew up. Horrible experience. I'm pretty disappointed. I doubt I'll ever come back.",

Was advised that there were no Lau laus today... WAIT, WHAT!!?  Was offered the kalua pig special instead and I declined causing the server to roll her eyes when I said \"hold on.\"   Not sure what happened to this place but that has never happened in the last 8 years I've been coming here.  The next thing that struck me weird, where are the locals. It was packed yet the number of locals in the restaurant could be counted on one hand.   Waiting on our food now, however this may be our last time coming here...  Too bad, this was the place to go...  Update: wife received her plate and they forgot the Mac salad. Not a big deal however the waitress never came back to check on us. Our drinks were empty and I really wanted more guava juice. Although one of the big bonuses to this place is the deserts, we decided to leave without getting any because we didn't want to wait any longer for a server.   Not the review I wanted to leave....",

My boyfriend and I were looking for some dinner options and stumbled upon this restaurant via yelp (thank you )  He orders the furikake chicken and i order the teriyaki chicken salad (watching my girlish figure.. pssh not really)  Anywho  Furikake Chicken portion basically can feed 2 ppl (yup that huge of a portion) and my salad was huge as well  both of us ended up eating only half of our dinner entrees and the rest was eaten for lunch the next day.  Taste wise? Furikake chicken is so yummy! (yes i took a lil bit from my bfs plate cause it looked so appetizing) So crispy, soy saucy and sweet all at the same time  Teriyaki chicken salad came with a huge amount of creamy dressing - i only used half of it. It tasted of sesame oil/ garlicky goodness  The salad had lettuce, tomatoes, crispy wontons and taro/ube in it! so satisfying!! wouldve liked more tomatoes though  Overall.. bomb food.. reasonably priced. This restaurant is here to stay",

The serving size is awesome, the service was as good as it gets, the atomosphere made me feel I was in Hawaii.  I never tried this place sooner because it's kind of far from home and work.  I considered \"far\" from work anything past Warm Springs.  Far doesn't seem so distant anymore.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I'll be dragging my significant other to this place in the next few weeks whether she likes it or not. And I know she's gonna LOVE it!",

When we received our menus I noticed the prices to be a way higher than the usual Hawaiian style joint. The menu was plain and had no pictures and the descriptions leave you wondering if it's going to be worth it or not.   My dudes ordered the Loco Moco and I ordered the mix plate with my boyfriend. My rice was a few hours old. My third bite into it I found a mustache hair or small black hair. I was disgusted because none of my dude friends have black hair, we are all blondes from California, so we can't be a suspect. I was disgusted not only because the hair wasn't on the top of my food, it was in the middle meaning it was mixed and cooked into the rice. That is extremely unprofessional for a kitchen staff. They have strict rules and regulations out here especially with the tourism out here. The manager came and said he has 3 restaurants 2 in Hawaii and this \"hair in the food\" issue has never occurred. I find it hard to believe as a former manager for Pizza Hut  and to never find any random item in food. The manager kept trying to get me to order something else from the menu but my stomach was in complete turmoil from this situation I only could drink my fruit punch, which the only good side was the free refills.   I came up to the manager and told him that I am going to just walk out and drop this issue and I left without paying because I don't feel my health is worth the price of the meal. He will be hearing form the health department soon.  Just please be careful people and check your food before you put it in your mouth.",

    "text": "Wow. This place is amazing!   A few people at work keep telling me about this place. I swing by on a Thursday around early evening time to try it out. The inside of the restaurant looked like a place I would see in Hawaii. It wasn't over done but it was nice. The place looks like it could fit 100 people easily. What did scare me was the place was empty. Well, when I first walked in, I did see some ladies sitting on a table... but to my surprise they were the cooks and help just sitting around waiting for hungry patrons like me.  After telling them I wanted to order to go, they handed me a regular menu menu with daily specials and let me at it. They had the typical things you would see on any Hawaiian restaurant menu. What thing I did notice is that they didn't have any Spam entrees. After a good five minutes of looking over the menu, I decided on the following:  Beef Teriyaki Steak - (Bottom sirloin marinated with our special Asian sauce then broiled to perfection and sliced thin - $8.75) Wow. When they say Steak, they mean it! I have never seen Beef Teriyaki so large. Its like regular Beef Teri on steroids! Check out my pictures on how huge the portions are. The beef was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order this again.  Hawaiian Style Roast Pork - (Cooked local style with Hawaiian salt, cracked black pepper, sliced thin and topped with our rich homemade brown gravy - $8.25) Yum! What makes this dish work is the homemade brown gravy. The roast port was tender and soft. Large portions as well. Great dish. I would definitely order this again as well.  Korean Chicken - (Golden fried drumettes $ wings tossed in our delicious Korean sauce - $8.75) Yay! This dish was awesome as well. When I first cracked open the box, I just saw crispy chicken wings. I scooped some rice and pick up a piece with my fork and placed the chicken on my plate. I licked my fork and damn.... it was over. Just the taste on the fork was really really good. I had to dig in. So many flavors hitting my taste buds! I love this dish! Would definitely order again.  Each dish comes with two scoops of rice and a side mac salad. The mac salad was good as well. Overall.... I love this place! The food is awesome. The portions are large the price is comparable to other Hawaiian joints. I would seriously recommend this place to my friends and everyone else who reads these reviews. You will not be disappointed.   Pictures included!",

So pretty much you'll be taking home leftovers when you come here.  The entire staff is very cool, but service can be very much like a bottle neck from 95 going to the spaghetti bowl during rush hour, but what the heck, this is a Big Island restaurant....we all take our time, and get it right most of the time.  When I come here, I usually get the teriyaki beef, and Korean chicken combo.   The portion is are opu-busting, and teriyaki is very good.   The chicken was a pre made fried chicken, but the Hawaiian style Korean sauce this chicken is dipped in made it a keeper.     Why the four stars, the Portuguese bean soup is too darn sweet, and have way too many beans, and not enough meat.  Also the mac salad was a bland Oahu style mac salad...not too impressive with those two items.  Only once, i made it out there for the Friday night for their Hawaiian combo plate, and the Lau Lau is pretty killer.      I highly recommend this plate, but I hate this drive on a Friday night from Henderson.",

I have been on the hunt for delicious ox-tail soup that is available during the day (because I'm always going to The California hotel for ox-tail soup but it is only offered after 11pm there)   I have to say that their ox-tail soup is a-ok the broth was good and they gave a lot of hunks of the ox-tail.   I did however try the loco moco that my boyfriend had and the gravy was reaaally good!   We also ordered the guava cake and that was also really good! and the portion was gigantic -- definitely sharing size for 2 or more people.   Overall, we had a great experience. I'm a little biased because all I had to rate was based off their ox-tail soup and I love the california hotel's ox-tail soup.",

Now I can't imagine going to Vegas without hitting this place up for a meal.  It's about 5 miles from the strip but soo worth the drive.  The ladies who work there are super friendly and the food is delish (I've tried the pork chops, chicken katsu loco moco, and roast pork).  They have specials on Friday nights as well as entertainment (at least on the Friday we were there.. Our last trip we went on a Saturday and they seemed to also have had entertainment then but not when we were there).  Anywhoo, I don't have anything negative to say about this place.... it's just good Hawaiian food.  Oh, and definitely order the gravy.  Maybe 2 of them.  You're welcome.",

I don't know because this is our first time here. With friends who've been here before, but not born and raised in HI. I had the loco moco, the gravy is not your stereotypical brown gravy, this was a tan gravy that was very bland. Our friends say it wasn't that bad last time, but uh, not good. However, the hamburger patty was good and homemade. One of the kids we were with said he liked the loco moco from Aloha Kitchen better. The furikake chicken was ok, looks really good but the taste didn't match the look. It was on the sweet side. Maybe we'll try it again, but there are a lot of other good places in this area to choose from, this wouldn't be a first choice for me.",

I was even more surprised to see that they kept the gratuity amount the same even after they removed the item that they didn't bring us... We normally tip well over 15% but in this case I don't feel that the service warranted an 18% tip... I'm glad that we looked over the bill because they never mentioned the automatic gratuity.

I tried the furikake chicken X kalbi short ribs. Short ribs were good, not chewy & not too fatty. Chicken was a little on the sweet side but super crispy. $9 chicken katsu loco moco. I had the gravy put on the side so my chicken was super crispy.  $14 furikake ahi tuna. Fresh & big chunks. Flavoring was really good but just a little too smokey.

    "text": "We tried this place about a month ago and had a pretty bad time. Firstly, we went with a group and the food took a very long time to come out. Of course longer waits are expected with a larger party, but it was a slow night and we waited much longer than anticipated. Then I had an extra wait because there was a mistake with my order (not the correct rice).  I wasn't really fond of the roast pork loco moco. I enjoyed the first bite but after that all I could taste was gravy. I only managed to get through about 1/3 of my meal because it was extremely filling, which brings me to the topic of our server.  Our server was the reason I was so irked after our visit here. After we got our food he commented on how little I was eating at least 2-3 times, and then again when we were on our way out. I thought it was very rude. The portions were huge and I actually ate all that I could eat - I am a paying customer, do not criticize me for how much of my food I decide to eat. It would have been one thing if I had wasted my leftovers, but I was taking it home anyway. On top of that, I thought he had an overall condescending and judgmental attitude while taking our orders and whenever he spoke to us throughout the meal. I am generally an easy going guest, honestly I can't even think of another time where I have ever disliked a server aside from the guy we had here.  Our last issue came when it was time to pay the bill. One person in our group paid the entire bill and didn't realize until after he paid that gratuity had already been added on the price. He said it didn't show on the receipt that he signed, and he didn't realize until we were on our way out that he had paid two times more tip than he should have. I didn't see the receipt myself so I can't pinpoint the issue here - but it added to the overall negative feeling of my experience here, especially because it was a large bill (and subsequently a large tip).  On the plus side, the hostess who greeted us on our way in/out was very nice. And again, portions are huge and gravy is plentiful - so if that's what you're into then I can see this being a nice place for that, but for us it was an awful experience.",

    "text": "So the first time I ever walked into this place, I noticed one thing.  Hawaiian people working the kitchen and Hawaiian people eating in the restaurant.  I knew I was in for a treat.  Unlike your run-of-the-mill fast food Hawaiian joints, Island Flavor stands atop my Hawaiian list of restaurants that are a must visit whether you're local or from out of town and craving that island fix.  The spam musubi is always a must for me to start, and my favorite two item plate is the Chop Steak and Furikake Chicken (this dish is so good, it will literally change your life or make you slap yo' mama, one of the two).   The Loco Moco and the Kahlua Pork are also staples if you're in the mood for something more savory.  Either way, everything here is top notch and you won't be disappointed.  The service here is also so friendly and fast! Mahalo!",

Then when I asked an Old timer server there (short portugese girl with a pony tail) She completely ignored us as well. WOW! What a sad way to leave a first impression on your clients with \"new Management\" Business will close with this type of Service. Sorry, but there is too many Hawaiian places that we can patron at and get better Service!",

    "text": "My wife and I don't gamble, our clubbing days are in our rear view mirrors, and watching Las Vegas type shows are a little too pricey for us.  So, what the heck are we in Vegas for?  Our daughter and her club volleyball team are here for four days competing in the SCVA 30th Las Vegas Classic Volleyball Tournament.  Since we don't do any of things most people do while in Vegas, what else is there to do.  Well, I didn't mention the other thing people do, which is what we did here at Island Flavor.  EAT!!!  There are several Island Flavor restaurants in Vegas, but the one you have to visit is the one off of Durango.  Island Flavor resides amongst other tenants in a small strip mall.  We visited Island Flavor for dinner and from the outside you would think the restaurant is tiny, which it's not once you walk inside.  It's also dark from the outside because of tint they have on their windows, which is probably due to the scathing sun during the Las Vegas heat.  Once we entered, the restaurant was jam packed, meaning that we were about to embark on some good eats.  That was an understatement.  Our group of 5 had to wait a little while because of how popular this place is.  There's not much of a waiting area.  The decor is Hawaiian themed through and through with island decor all over the restaurant.  The staff worked hard to turn tables and provided decent customer service, but did the best they could considering how busy they were.  Island Flavor represented Hawaiian food really well.  As we walked into the restaurant, you are greeted by a display case filled with spam musubi, which should tell you what to expect.  I ordered the loco moco and ahi poke furikake.  Boy was I happy!!!  The ahi poke furikake was divine and tasty-licious.  It was fresh, seasoned just right, and combined with sliced vegetables.  I can say that Island Flavor's ahi poke can compete with the best of them.  I ordered half a pound, which was less than $8 and was a great appetizer.  When my loco moco was brought out, my group and I were amazed that it came out in a huge bowl.  Coming out in a bowl should tell you how much food you're getting.  It was massive and I didn't finish half of that dish.  It was doused with gravy, with cooked just right hamburger patty, had a bounty of rice, and was topped with two sunny side eggs.  Once I broke the yolk and watched it flow onto the gravy, hamburger, and rice, I was salivating before I took my first bite.  The conglomeration of everything really satisfied me except for one minus.  The gravy needed either salt or seasoning, but that meal with its massiveness is what I call True value for your money.  For my family of 3 and the amount of food we ordered, I really thought we got our money's worth and we were able to bring home leftovers.  I definitely recommend ahi poke furikake and the loco moco.  Although we don't do most of the usual Las Vegas things to do, we always do what Las Vegas is also known for, which is stuff your face until your belly hurts.  Thank you Island Flavor for doing this in spades.  Yummy-licious Big Time!!!",

    "text": "I love this place... Feels like home. The Aloha Spirit is alive & well within these walls... There's no bettah compliment I can give a Hawaiian restaurant. Island Flavor is located in an unassuming strip mall on Durango. It's probably a good 15-20 minute drive via freeway from the Las Vegas strip. It is worth the drive. Trust me... Drove up and I knew it was gonna be good cause there were people waiting outside to be seated and also I could hear a small group (3-piece band) inside singing Hawaiian music. It was great. I felt at home... It's kind of how Hawai'i makes you feel. Aloha all around.   I ordered the chicken katsu loco moco after seeing photos of it by other Yelpers (mahalos!). It came served in a giant bowl. Let me just say that I feel classic loco moco dishes or any variation of a loco moco should be served in a bowl. It's only fitting. The katsu was delicious. The batter was light and chicken was not dry. The gravy that was generously poured over tasted great with the katsu and the bed of white rice. SO ONO... Sadly I was a weakster and could only finish half of this heavy handed portion of a meal. Even our waitress was giving me grief saying I cannott leave if I cant even eat half. HAHA.... Apparently, I didnt hit the required quota. I will make sure to represent mo bettah next time.  And of course we couldnt leave without having the coco puffs... I havent had them since when I was fortunate enough to attend my coworker's wedding on Oahu in which she had Liliha Bakery supply coco puffs & green tea puffs instead of slices of wedding cake... It was so good & so appropriate. Quite possibly one of the more delicious sweet things I've had in my life. Now Island Flavor's coco puffs are not exactly the same as Liliha's original version but they are delicious in their own right. Totally worth the $6 or so for the half-dozen. They top it with whipped cream too but that really isnt even needed. They are great and are a taste of Oahu for sure.  I will make sure to eat here next time in town which is thankfully enough next weekend... I'm gonna bring some of my friends that havent been there before & I'm sure they will like it as much as I do and spread the word as I have.",

    "text": "Went here this morning (6/1/14) because I didn't have all the ingredients I needed for ossobuco. I decided to pop on over to this place by myself before I headed off to work. With nearly a 5 star rating, my expectations were through the roof.  You know those movies where token \"not whatever race everyone else is,\" walks into a bar and everyone turns around and looks at them and a soundtrack of a disc stopping plays in the background. Umm, yeah, that's what it felt like when I walked in. I was the only white person here and everyone turned around when I walked in. Super strange. Plus, two tables of people kept staring at me during my meal and trying to make eye contact. Whatevs.  Anyway, I guess I was channeling Michael U. and decided to try more than one item off of the menu. This is how I wound up spending $34 (including tax and tip) on a meal just for myself that consisted of soup, salad, and a piece of cake. Yeah, I can't order like that on the regular, regardless of the fact that I walked out with enough leftovers for another large meal.  I ordered: Hawaiian Style Saimin $8.75 I am convinced that the egg had to be rancid in this soup. It smelled and tasted off. Noodles were very grainy tasting and the broth was bland. I picked around the egg. Would not get again and would suggest you refrain from ordering this.  Island Flavor Salad $13.95 The Opakapaka (pink snapper) was great! This salad comes with a TON of dressing on the side and luckily, it is delicious. Loved the combo of flavors. The only thing that would have made this better is if it had some chunks of citrus thrown in to the salad. Would get again.  Guava Cake $5 BLAND. Tasted like nothing with Cool Whip for frosting. I was served this in a to-go box for whatever reason, but it worked out because I didn't eat the whole thing so it was already ready to go.  Service was whatever. I would have loved a water refill at any point in the meal. Seems as if there are a bunch of regulars because the waitresses were chatty and friendly with everyone. While the salad was good, I don't know if it was good enough to warrant another trip back here.",

Many of my friends order the Furikake Chicken but I'm not a fan of anything with seaweed. I've also tried their Chicken Katsu and it's pretty amazing! The staff is super friendly, on busy nights, you will have a little wait for your food BUT it is worth the wait! Price is really good for the quality of the food. If you are craving for some Hawaiian, definitely check this place out! Yummm!",

    "text": "Totally surpassed my expectations for yet another Hawaii comfort food place in Vegas. So far, based on my multiple visits, ordered dishes have been good. Most recently, I tried the Portuguese Sausage with 2 eggs, Hoisin Baby Back Ribs, and Furikake Fried Chicken. Everything, I mean everything was good. The sausage plate came with rice and mac salad. The sausages were sweet and not too salty. The rice and mac salad just sealed the deal. Drizzle that egg yolk and mix with the sausage and rice, and get ready for some hit the spot goodness.   The baby back ribs were near perfection. Pork meat nearly dropped off the bones and the Hoisin glaze was quite a unique sauce experience. The glaze was sweet but not that overly sugary taste you would find at a traditional bbq joint, but more of a refined sweetness. Not sure how to describe in words. Just order the rack.  Furikake chicken was delicious. The texture was crunchy and no where near soggy. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Paired that rice, and my goodness. You can't stop!  The location is off-strip, but on the way to Red Rock. In fact, it's nice to get away from strip madness on a Vegas strip. Regardless of the location, this is one of my to-go places on every one of my Vegas excursions.",

The food is excellent and tastes just like the authentic local food in Hawaii!! The Furikake chicken and spare ribs are delicious. The beef teriyaki is cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce, and loco moco is tastey. Their desserts are amazing, especially the ice cream mud pie and the guava cake. Customer service is also excellent. Whether we dine in or order via phone, they are always so pleasant and embrace the Hawaiian family culture.",

Not sure what has changed about the place but it doesn't have the local island feel it once had. If you're looking for another great Hawaiian food restaurant, I would check out Fist of Fusion down the street. Will not be going to island flavor any more.",

I went with a classic chicken katsu, and you have the option of getting either katsu sauce or gravy. I asked for both, and they charged me extra which is lame because katsu sauce should be free meh. My friend ordered a mixed plate of kalbi and Hawaiian style roast pork. TBH I thought my friend's meat options were better. My chicken katsu was not as crispy as I usually like them, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because it was a to-go order. Also, they forgot my macaroni salad which is a muuust with any hawaiian dinner plate. However, this place redeemed itself with the gravy. WOW you can put that gravy on everything...your rice, the chicken katsu, my face...it was that good!!! I'm open to giving this place another try.",

Whenever you went here to eat you made sure you brought your appetite because of the taste and large portions. Now, you don't even get mac salad standard and have to pay for extra gravy. The burger steak is saturated in pepper and herbs to the point where you can't fully taste the gravy and beef. It's sad to say but L&L has better food at this point. Alisa, your ownership and direction really destroyed a great restaurant. I suggest reaching back out to the original owners and learning how they did things coz the new way isn't working. I will no longer be eating here unless word of mouth reveals that things have changed.  Update: New owner says my review is not accurate. Let's be specific here. She means I was inaccurate about my statement that Mac salad isn't standard anymore but she didn't dispute the rest of my review. I will take that as an acknowledgment from her about the degraded quality of the food at Island Flavor. I also will state that I did not receive mac salad with my order. The new owner's response definitely confirms that there is no more aloha here. Alisa, sell this business before you drive it into the ground. Sell it to someone from Hawaii that really loves cooking and serving up good island food.",

    "text": "My favorite Hawai'ian spot in Vegas! I LOVE going here. (Prefer this location over the express location near me, in Henderson.) There are a variety of local kine grindz to choose from that are a unique to this place.   You wouldn't really think about going to a Hawaiian restaurant for a burger, but I LOVE their Big Burger! You're probably wondering, \"Really?! Why?\" There's a unique seasoning they use in the ground meat that makes it one of the best burgers I've had so far in Las Vegas. The patty is thick and seasoned well, served with thick cut fries.   My go-tos are the furukaki chicken and furikake shrimp. They usually have the Hawaiian plate on Fridays, and other daily specials. Check out their white board near the front.  You can also make your plates low carb by asking for mixed veggies (sliced and sauteed squash) instead of rice and macaroni salad.   Make sure to save room for dessert or take it to go ;-). They have an amazing Kona Coffee Mud Pie, which is my go-to. Goes great with the Kona coffee they serve. They have a great list of other desserts as well.   In December, they had Punalu'u French Toast!!! So ono! (So good/delicious!) It's definitely a must try. It's made with bread from the Punalu'u Bakery, the Southernmost bakery in the USA, on the Big Island at an area called South Point (the southernmost point in the USA.) They also sell loaves of it next door, at the Island Flavor Market.   ** Note: Or they use to! :-( Found out on my last visit they don't sell Punalu'u bread anymore. (Please bring it back, if can! :-) )   TIP:  Also check out their market next door for Hawaiian food, snacks, slippahs, 100% Kona coffee, chocolates, t-shirts, hats etc.   There's always that Aloha service here from all the staff and it definitely makes me feel like I'm home.  **I noticed on my last visit a week ago, that the portions were smaller, and some prices went up. I hope they go back to the serving size they had before. Mahalo. Still my favorite place to get Hawai'ian local kine grindz!  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #3",

But since I was here, I order their Hawaiian Poke plate.  It was way too salty and I didn't finish my plate because all I tasted was their shoyu sauce on the poke.

The recent remodel and small changes to their amazing menu are great!  Usually a creature of habit but the food is still bomb and everyone is always so ALOHA when assisting guests.

I usually also get a mixed plate which lets you get 2 different local favorites (either chicken katsu, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, hamburger steak, shrimp, kalbi ribs, roast pork, chop steak, or korean chicken). The Loco Moco is also very good and on Fridays you can get the Hawaiian plate special with lau lau. Come hungry, hang out and relax to traditional hawaiian food that makes you feel like you are back on the islands.",

Not only is it tasty, but the portions are HUGE. That's one thing I love about a place....the portions! They have some other island favorites Kalua Pig and cabbage, Chicken Katsu  and Kalbi Short Ribs are just a few to mention. Top if off with some haupia cake and you've got a meal.",

And so do the portions!    I had myself a combo of Hawaiian roasted pork w/ gravy and chicken katsu.  The pork had just the right amount of salt and pepper and although the gravy was an added touch, I could probably just eat the pork by itself.  Oh wait, no, with rice.  Gotta have the rice.  The chicken katsu was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Sampled the poke' and it was fairly good.  I say \"fair\" because I've tasted better homemade poke'.  I'm not really a fan of macaroni salad, but their macaroni salad is a level up from L&L's.    That day I \"broke da mouth\" but I probably also broke some skin and gained another stretchmark.    Hawaii is always a stopover for me when I travel to and from my island home of Guam.  Island Flavors is definitely going to be a stopover for me everytime I go to Vegas!!",

Why is there so much fat?   Chicken Katsu: Why is it burnt?   Korean Chicken: Where's the spice? Why is there chicken fuzz still on it? Eeewww!  Kalbi/Short Ribs: Why so stingy and too sweet?  Portuguese Sausage: What is that weird after taste?   Lau Lau: Why is it so dry? Almost like shredded wet cardboard.   Furikake Shrimp: What's so special about breaded fried shrimp with furikake sprinkles on it? Come on, lets get more creative here.  Loco Moco & Hamburger Steak: Sure, it's big but why is it so bland?   Mac Salad: No, no. (shaking my head) So salty.   Spam Musubi: How can you sell cold musubi left for hours on the counter?   Kikoman \"cheap stuff\" soy sauce? You know everyone back home favors Aloha Shoyu!   UGH!  I gave this place so many chances and I ALWAYS left disappointed.

    "text": "Island Flavor and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so.  Always in search of good local food, Island Flavor has become king of Las Vegas as far as I'm concerned.  First L&L...then Aloha Kitchen...and Ross J's...it was like climbing the ladder of local food with each one being better than the last.  And at the top was Island Flavor.  Entrees under $9.  Gigantic portions that will feed you for two meals.  Delicious, consistent food.  Make you feel-at-home service.  This place really has all of the ingredients for creating a regular customer out of me.    My favorite dish to order is the mixed plate with Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Beef.  Each plate comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad.  The katsu is breaded just right, not too thick, with the chicken still moist inside.  The teriyaki beef is out of this world!  Honestly, anything beef on their menu is amazing (from the hamburger to the teriyaki, from the steak and onions to the loco moco) and is highly recommended.  I've also had some of their pork dishes and was very impressed with them as well; I don't really like pork, but here is a place where I'll order it.    No joke, I'm getting some intense cravings for their food as I write this review.  Yes, I was just there a week ago...but for a good 6 months or so I pretty much came here once a week!  Highly recommended.",

Two to three chicken breasts, two scoops of rice and a scoops of macaroni salad all for less than $10.  The chicken was well cooked, not dry, but the homemade teriyaki sauce was really salty. The rice helped, but only so much. The macaroni salad was a little bland, but there was a peppery finish. The white rice, was white rice, not too much you can say about it except it wasn't Uncle Ben's. I do wish there was more of it to help with the teriyaki sauce and I wish there was an option for brown rice.  The waitress was very attentive and made sure my ice tea never stayed empty for too long. The only other drawback other than the salty teriyaki sauce is the location. I wish they had a location closer to where I live!",

The Kalua Pig and cabbage, Chicken Katsu  and Kalbi Short Ribs are one (and many more) of our favorites.  The Hawaiian Style Saimin soup comes with everything (not like other places that charge extra for wontons or vegetables, crazy!?).  Island Flavor also caters to customers who rather have steak.  The top sirloin and rib eye are served to perfection (tender and juicy) as though it was cooked in a gourmet steakhouse.  Now if you have a sweet tooth for good dessert, this is also the place!  Their Chantilly, Hopia and Guava cakes are to die for! Kona Coffee Mud pie and banana bread pudding are also a must to taste.  You will savor every taste by flavoring each layer of awesome goodness.  The servings are mammoth and the price is worth every penny, especially when you have enough for another meal the next day!  Island Flavor has such a welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive!  As often as we eat here, we came in as customers and leave as their friends.",

I was so excited to bring my cousin that was born & raised in Hawaii and so sure she was going to LOVE and appreciate it especially because it wasn't on the main land what she ordered was really bad. The chicken katsu loco moko. The gravy was lumpy and thick it didn't look like gravy. It looked more like mashed potatoes. really tho!!! The chicken has no taste at all. I felt so bad because I raved, and raved about this place and the ONE TIME I take a family member there it was BAD. Really upset. I was so embarrassed.

Kalbi short ribs, katsu, shoyu chicken all very good.    I believe on Friday nights, they have specials such as Lau Lau, etc.    I also like how they play Hawaiian music in the background.",

We loved their poke, which comes in 3 versions. The one I got was with furikake, and it was a bomb! We got the one pound order and it was gone between my hubby and I. Hubby had the meat combo - pork with onions and kalbi ribs. He liked the pork a lot. And how many Hawaiian restaurants serve haupia? This one does! A testimony that it's authentic from the islands! Haupia was so good and my little one loved it after his fried chicken feast. We even ordered their oxtail soup for to go. It was a stomach-hearty way to start our Las Vegas day!",

It's also closer to my house, so I think I might be sad to admit that Ohana might not be getting as much of my business anymore!  Definitely recommend going here for food.

Some people that came in 20 mins after us sat down, got there drinks & ordered. At this time I was really upset. Stopped one of the workers & told her that we've been waiting about 30 mins for someone to take our order & I see people that got seated way after we arrived ordering. She was telling me they have a phone order & I said no they came in after we got here. We were so ready to walk out but my kids were hungry. After this happening we are \"NEVER\" coming here again.

    "text": "Long over due to write a review for this place. I've gone here for breakfast, lunch and dinner plenty of times. Its a tradition now, to take guests visiting, for at least one meal.  The interior is fully decorated island style and staff are all hawaiians as far as I can tell. Staff members are also very friendly and easily make you feel at home. They always got local island music playing that just adds on to the experience.  My Favorites:  Chicken Katsu Loco Moco: Perfectly breaded chicken cut into strips, white rice, pair of over easy eggs and they're rich and thick homemade brown gravy (they're gravy is what sets them apart from every other hawaiian bbq eatery)  Loco Moco: Same as above except for the chicken, its a grilled homemade hamburger patty  Kalbi Short Ribs: Charbroiled, quite tender and soaked with flavor. If the bone was edible, there would be nothing left..  Korean Chicken: fried little drumsticks and wings tossed in their special sauce. Mild and uniquely flavorful, I can put these down!  Pork Chops: 2 pieces of grilled bone-in pork chops, topped with mushroom and onions. I always get a side of their gravy and pour it over and smother the chops. So So Comforting!  I've also tried their teriyaki beef and chicken, fried rice.. everything is great!  **Portions are HUMONGOUS!! As the hawaiians say \"Don't eat until your full, eat until you pass out\"   **Full Entree Orders Will Easily serve 2! Prices are very reasonable! Service is great!  One of My Favorite Hawaiian BBQ Spots!!! (and yes, I've been to L&L, Ohana, Shakas, the one in the California Hotel, Aloha Kitchen.. to name a few.. Not to mention some places in Hawaii itself)",

But the wait is long enough to start looking at other people's food while waiting. Long waits mean steak and burgers, no? But compensated by the sweet, genuine service.  And the bill, is ridiculously small. Had to whip out my magnifying glass to realize how cheap the tab was.    I deeply recommend the mud pie dessert, which is also sharable.  *B.A.= bad ass",

I ordered the Chop Steak & Onions, and the sauce was so good with everything! My boyfriend ordered the Furitake (?) Chicken and that was AWESOME as well. The food took about 15 minutes to come out but that was fine because the kitchen was taking their time to prepare it for us, and we all know that when it comes to food, quality over quantity (which in this case, Island Flavor had both!!). :) This is a must-try if you're around Vegas!!",

    "text": "As we were driving around, throwing out ideas on what to eat, our Vegas local residence suggested and made the executive decision to come here.  Nobody who was familiar with the restaurant complained so I was down, I love Hawaiian food and I wasn't in Vegas to eat healthy.  I wanted carbs.    The place was fairly empty when we got there and the menu is pretty straight forward.  We ended up ordering family style plus three spam musubi's.   We got the loco moco and then the mixed plate (furikake chicken, teriyaki steak and galbi) substituting mac salad for rice and then a guava cake for later which we ended up eating at the restaurant. So my fatass pretty much ate a little bit of everything and loved it, especially their mac salad since I love mac salad.  We were trying to limit the amount of food we were ordering because we were planning on getting Mexican food later, but the 5 of us pretty much chowed down and polished off all the food.  The consensus at the table was that the teriyaki steak was a bit too sweet but the guava cake was really good, except Vince thought he was eating a strawberry cake....I don't know. My personal favorites were the furikake chicken and the mac salad.  The rice helped soak up all the sauces of the meats but I highly recommend swapping rice out for mac salad.   All in all, one of the better Hawaiian restaurants I have been to outside of Hawaii.  The food is much better than your generic, chain Hawaiian restaurants that are everywhere.",

It took an hour to receive our food when it was received all of our food was cold.    Giving it an hour to receive our food I've noticed there wasnumerous tables that only had drinks and still waiting for there food and makes it worse they were there before us.  There was a gentleman by himself sitting down I felt bad for the waitress sat him down to a 4 seated table, then a couple of 2 walks in and she moved the gentleman from a 4 seated table to a 2 seated table so the couple could sit down but where the waitress had seated him there was a bigger party then came in and they needed that 2 seated table to connect to a bigger table to fit the party so within an hour the gentleman was moved twice that was such bad customer service.   ~Miss you aunty maile and uncle Bruce ... keep Hawaiian restaurants in Hawaiian hands!",

It's a great restaurant located in the southwest area, the complete opposite side of town from where I live, but the 'ono local grinds makes the drive worth it.  The service is quite good, but they get hit pretty hard on Friday nights and the weekends so prepare yourself for long wait times. They usually have a live Hawaiian music jammin' on Friday nights.  This place is my go-to for authentic Hawaiian food. I make it my mission to eat there every Friday for their Aloha Friday Special which consists of pork laulau (with butterfish), rice, mac or tossed salad, lomi lomi salmon, and haupia. All their dishes are made there and seasoned to perfection which come out smelling savory and appetizing, unlike other places that serve frozen laulau.  A family favorite is the mixed plate with furikake chicken and kalbi ribs.  The prices are reasonable and servings are big.",

Don't waste any time! Just come here!  My favorite is always the kalbi short ribs. They're nice and thick and full of sweet saltiness! They're also a bit fatty but that's why they're good!  I'll occasionally order the furikake chicken and the katsu which have always been on point too!  I have ordered the kalua pork with lettuce and they separated it for me from my other food to avoid it getting soggy on my to go order!

I came here on the weekend and it wasn't too busy, they seem to be expanding as there was some renovation going on along the right side after you enter in the restaurant.  The windows are tinted so from the outside you can't see in, and it keeps the restaurant nice and cool.  The Furikake Chicken plate, undeniably delicious.  It's basically pieces of chicken with a nice thin layer of breading and sauce (the perfect amount of both).  Of course, it's topped with a bit of furikake.  Each bite is savory, lightly crisp, and full of flavor.  Accompanying the chicken is a macaroni salad and 2 generous mounds of sushi rice.  This plate is shareable and my girlfriend and I ordered a side of rice (they give you 2 more huge mounds of rice) and shared the plate.  Service is good here, everyone is friendly.  I would try other dishes here but man, that Furikake Chicken though.",

    "text": "Was really excited to try this place last weekend, pictures looked really good and portion sizes looked very big.  Ordered the tuna poke for appetizer, tuesday noodle special, and the furikake chicken.    When the food came out my mouth was watering and was ready to dig in.  Couple bites into the poke we noticed that it was very very salty.  There was way too much sauce and it tasted like the sauce had extra salt in it.  We felt bad to have expensive tuna re-done so we just ate it as best we could.  Was very disappointing to start the meal off with really salty poke.  How can you over sauce poke to the point where its just drenched in salt??  At this point our taste buds had so much salt in it everything else just tasted like salt.  Furikake chicken was good, but the glaze just tasted salt because of the poke we had eaten.  Noodles were good but that was salty too because it had pieces of spam in it and also was seasoned with some kind of sauce that was salty.  It was supposed to come with teryiaki sauce on top but I ordered it without it (thank goodness).  Overall, portions are big, the food looks great but be aware that it can be very very salty.  I have never had hawaiian food taste so salty, maybe that is how people like it in vegas, I am not sure.  The only thing that wasn't salty was mac salad which actually was really good.    Advice to the chef and the owner, please please PLEASE taste the food before you send it out, or offer the sauces on the side.  Once it is all on the food it will be too late.  I would love to try other thing on the menu next time I visit, I will just keep in mind to order everything on the side.",

    "text": "I finally have some time to update my review after my busy tax season.....  I wanted to give an update to what happened after I submitted my review while waiting for my food at Island Flavor.  The owner Alisa P. must have received a notification that someone wrote a review on Yelp, because she called out \"Who's Henry H?!\",  I raised my hand thinking my food was ready since I had been waiting an hour or that she had read my review.  I walked up to her and said I am Henry H. and she asked me if I wrote the review and I said \"Yes\", she said she would be more than happy to refund my money without giving me my food since I was so unhappy based on the review.  I said I would still like my food and I wrote the review to indicate my displeasure of waiting so long for my food and that she should address the wait times since there were other reviews that complained about the wait times or she should inform customers that the food will take longer so that customers can wait at home instead of the restaurant.  Alisa responded with \"I can't just go and make you your food right now!\", which wasn't the type of response I would expect from a manager and especially from an owner when the customer is still waiting for their food.  I asked her what time it was so she could compare the current time and the time on the receipt of when the order was taken.  It had been over an hour.  Alisa took offense to my comments on the review and I told her it was coming from a place of constructive criticism to help her.  Alisa continued to discuss my review and how she doesn't like it when people write negative reviews online instead of asking to speak with a manager or supervisor.  Keep in mind that this all occurred inside the front entrance and I am sure all the customers could see, if not hear everything.  I responded and told her that our current interaction is the reason why people don't ask for the manager or supervisor; some people don't like confrontation and the fact that the restaurant looked really busy.  I have been a manager of a restaurant and have received complaints and I have also been a customer complaining to the manager, so personally I am comfortable with confrontation if necessary, however other people are not.  Based on my negative experience of waiting over an hour for food when I expected it to be ready in 20-25 minutes and also the undesirable personal interaction with the owner, I can no longer support this establishment.  If the owner is willing to speak to a paying customer with so much disrespect in front of other paying customers when she could be helping out her \"team\" during a busy time, I don't want to imagine how she treats her employees.  I hope you enjoy the positive reviews and take the negative reviews as constructive criticism.",

I have always been a loyal customer here, even when I heard that new management took over.  I overlooked all the negative remarks that I heard throughout the \"Hawaiian Community\" and continued to give the new owners a chance.    UNTIL TODAY!!! As I sat down for a late lunch, I witnessed the owner \"Alisa\" approach one of her employees - a female server and walked her to the back into a office I assume. What I heard was appalling and heartbreaking!  I heard this grown women that is supposed to be a professional business owner screaming at the top of her lungs \"GET THE FU@K OUT\" and  continued to scream at her employee and kept repeating \"GET THE FU@K OUT\" I watched the girl walk out teary eyed and embarrassed and yet still managed to smile at me, grabbed her belongings and left .     How dare she speak to anyone in this manner, an adult behaving like an immature child!! She is clearly unprofessional, ignorant, and a disgrace to the ninth island community as I found out today from a friend...that she refers to us as \"You Hawaiians\" in a demeaning fashion as if we are beneath her.  I am WOW'D and OUTRAGED and will make sure that the entire HAWAIIAN community hears about this!!! Alisa, you have a lot to learn about the Local Community....remember where your bread and butter comes from!",

Even if the owners have \"owned it\" for the last 8 months, I can certainly tell you that prices have changed and portions have changed. They used to give you 3 Kalbi short ribs laid uncut across the plate. Now they chop them up, and it's really only 2. Also all other portions have been reduced. Don't believe the lies when the owner says they increased the portions. They just changed the plates!! Maybe not ALL portions changed, but most protein did. Being honest $15 is a lot for a mixed plate with smaller portions.   The ambiance is GONE and doesn't feel like anything special now. I don't recognize many of the staff as I used to. Going to try other places. Makai up the street has a better feel and pretty tasty food, with lower prices.   Disappointed overall and not going to buy the owners canned replies and fickle replies... saying they didn't raise prices, then saying on another post that they did... saying they didn't change portions when sooooo many people noticed they did!!! And don't get me started on the recent reviews of cold owner replies and the barrage of management issues with employees. :( sad.   Previous review.... sadly, I no longer agree.  We always love the food here. Can seem pricy compared to other Hawaiian places, but the portions are large to compensate for that. We often get two or more meals out of one plate! Never had any issues with the food, and every time our family is in town they like to go here. The staff is always friendly and treats you well. I often order ahead and pick it up to take him. Very satisfying food to a crazy work day!",

There was also the macaroni salad which tasted a little different then most of the other salads that I have tasted It had something different or flavor in it In a good way though I'm so happy  in how good this place is and was super unfortunate that I did not visit this place earlier But that's going to change I will be visiting this place ASAP!",

The portions are huge! Usually when portions are big they skimp out on the quality but not this place. All the chicken and need dishes are amazing and the Mac salad is one of the better Mac salads I've had. This place can get busy though so make sure you have a little time to wait.

Thinking about all our options in the area, we finally decided to head to Island Flavor. I had never been before, but my friend kept raving about their cakes, so I was excited. I opted for the guava cake and my friend ordered the Haupia cake. I also ordered a kalbi plate to-go for my fella.  The guava was delicious, but the Haupia was my real favorite. Both were incredibly fluffy and light. Delicate flavors, I can't wait to come back for their desserts alone. Service was quick and refills were plentiful.   Our takeout order was ready quickly and we were on our way. I couldn't resist taking a bite or two of my fella's kalbi plate as well. The meat was flavorful and cooked well. It had a nice smoky flavor and the mac salad was one of the better versions I've had. Not overly creamy and complemented the meat and rice perfectly.  The food was great and I look forward to coming back to try the rest of their menu.",

Long enough for someone to come by and take our drink order and even our food order (because we've been here so many times we knew what we wanted). Time to go somewhere else. On the way out I said to one of the cooks that the service was poor and he had a stunned look on his face. Then I noticed in the hall, two female servers in the back just standing there talking.

Their servings were huge!!! You may want to try to share a plate with a friend. The short ribs were cooked perfectly, as well as the chicken katsu.

CONS:       Service - very wishy washy depending on the staff working that day. One of the girls is extremely friendly while one of the other servers always has a confused look on her face and doesn't bother asking if you'd like the green salad or macaroni salad, which I think are extremely different and can make or break a meal.

    "text": "Great food. This is pretty all about the food. Which is why we're here, right people? First off, if you're a couple you can usually be seated immediately. If not, you may wait half an hour until your party is seated. Now, food. Let's taco 'bout food. It's amazing. THE END  Pros: casual, clean, dark, delicious food, price  Cons: hours of operation, no wifi, smal,   Overall: The decor is cute. It feels like you're eating in your Hawaiian grandma's dining area, AKA the couch. Their is a bathroom, and there is also Apple Pay. Two thumbs up in my book. The location makes it easy to find parking, as well as see from the street. The sign is green. The chain of operations in east. Walk in, wait to be seated, order from the double sided laminated menu, enjoy the food the cook worked hard to prepare, order dessert (I enjoy the Kona Coffee Mudpie), pay, day thank you, coke again. Lol! It's really good! And on your way out you can grab a couple of spam musabi for a feeble price of $2-$3 each. What's not to like? Mahalos!",

About a couple miles west of the 215 off the Durango exit, you will find a little bit paradise at this location. Well, foodwise anyway.   As you come in, you will see that they have plenty of tables. Since it was lunchtime it was a bit busy but I was still able to get an open table. I was greeted warmly and was sat down right away.   Looking over the menu, I decided to go with the mixed plate combo of Kalbi Ribs and Kalua Pork. I went with Brown rice for no extra charge which is a plus. Lastly, it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad.  I got 3 nice pieces of Kalbi Ribs. I thought they were a bit on the salty end but still ok. The Kalua Pork came in a cup mixed with cabbage and basically in its own cooked juices. Good flavor. The Macaroni Salad was really good. I can taste the pepper that has been mixed into it. The Brown Rice was a bit dry like they cooked it early in the morning and it has been on warm the whole time. Overall I think the Ribs could have been a little less salty and the Brown Rice maybe could of had some kind of teriyaki sauce on it so that it wouldnt of been so bland.  Service was pretty good. Got everything I needed in a timely manner. I spent a total of 13 bucks and some change because the if you get the Kalbi Ribs as one of your choices, its a dollar extra.   Overall, its not a bad to place to eat especially if you are in the area. Next time I am thinking of trying their Poke Salad although people have said that it has doubled in price. I guess I missed out on those days then. Once I try it, we will see if its worth the price.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #107 \"Island Flavor in the boonies, literally\"",

    "text": "So went here for a late lunch on a Wednesday... It was around 2pm, and the place was packed! Luckily we were seated right as the extra people started coming in... At first, the lady working was a little intimidating, like a tough older sister. My family joked that we didnt wanna ask her for anything! Later on as the things settled down, she became more friendly, and her big sister attitude stayed (love it!)...   Anyways...   Oh my goodness... I had the furikake chicken... To be honest, I tasted just a tiny hint of furikake on the glazed pieces of chicken. It mainly was a sweet taste that was yummmmy!... I also got hamburger steak that comes smothered in gravy with a little bit of onion and mushroom. A super heavy meal, those plates are good for sharing! My husband had the chicken katsu loco moco. Again, A huge serving that comes in a big bowl, also tasty... I later tried my moms leftover chicken teriyaki.. That too had a good taste that wasn't too sweet or salty, but full of flavor.   I love the family vibe I get from this place. Big sister (aka our server) even told my husband she'll give him a slice of cake for free next time we visit! (After seeing him eye every slice of cake that came out of the kitchen)... We were too full to get a slice at the time.  Pls come check this place out!..",

FOOD I ordered Loco Moco: 10oz homemade hamburger patty on steamed rice topped with two eggs any style and brown gravy. Choice of original, roast pork or chicken katsu. Patty was good but my gravy felt like it had too much butter in it.   I do want to point out that their serving size is HUGE. It seemed that all the other table asked for a box to take the left overs home. When my server handed me the order, I immediately started to wonder if I accidentally ordered triple mega extra large or they mistakenly thought I was participating in some kind of eating contest. Honestly, the dish that loco moco came in look like a bathroom sink. I could dive in and swim in this. What even.  No complaints because left over means you get to enjoy more. Plus the price is really cheap considering the amount they give you.   CONCLUSION Island Flavor is as good as it gets. Easily my top favorite Hawaiian restaurant!",

I was a little sad though because I asked for over easy eggs and they were cooked all the way, no runny yolk for me. Plus I like a little more crisp to my spam not burnt but a bit more browned. I'll be back and next time I'll let them know about the type of cook I want and to make sure my yolk runs. Lol!",

I haven't had any other Hawaiian food out here in Vegas but it sure is better than the few I've had in San Diego.  I ordered the Loco Moco and the serving was like home (Enough to feed 4).  You know how us islanders do!  Chicken Furicake was full of taste and hit da spot on point, as the Kalibi Ribs were big cuts and good as expected.  Of course I had to try the Poke, it didn't disappoint for being a whole state east from the Ocean. Overall if you on an empty stomach, make a stop here and expect to leave with a full stomach feeling more than satisfied.  Its DA KINE!",

And just as I imagine the warm culture of Aloha, I can taste the love, the bear hugs and coconut massages in the food of Island Flavor.  It's a tiny space, usually PACKED on weekends, and even if they have live music on Friday nights, the place remains to be a low key, well lit family restaurant.  Go here with family, with good friends and a HUGE appetite.  Hubby and I always get the same thing - half a Furikake ahi poke order, and we share a combo plate of Kalbi ribs and Korean fried chicken.. with extra macaroni salad and fries.  Real tasty stuff, and a good bang for your buck.  Our bill always stays within the $30 range.  Their teriyaki chicken, steak and onions hit the spot, and their Chantilly cake ROCKS.  It's also the first time I've ever tried a loco moco.  To the Filipinos out there, it tastes exactly like a burger steak meal with thick gravy, except it's served with egg.  Perfect hangover or stoner food.  Go go go.",

We were wondering why it had two  $ signs and realized that it was a sit down restaurant. Don't be scared of the two $ signs when you come here. The serving size more than makes up for the couple bucks more you pay. Most of my friends paid about $11-$12 and had half a meal to spare. I, on the other hand, devoured my food, partly because it was delicious  and partly because i was so hungry. I ordered the chicken Katsu plate and it kept me satisfied for the rest of the day until late night for dinner.",

    "text": "We were interested in finally trying Island Flavor, so I arrived here in a party of three one weekend. We stood waiting at the front without being noticed for who knows how long. The cashier woman and the three servers went about their business acting unaware we were there. Not one glance and not a single 'Hi, just a moment please' or 'Have you been helped yet?' (you know, those simple phrases that every other restaurant uses to greet incoming customers?). After standing idle up there for an indefinite period of time we were miraculously sat down.   So we quickly ordered realizing things would take forever if we didn't take action immediately. The food was good and they do give you fairly large portions for what you pay for. However, the restaurant's bizarre ongoing neglectful behavior ensued. As we were eating, another party sat down next to us and I witnessed as all three servers took turns coming by this table to give their happy undivided attention within a brief time span while we were barely serviced by our lone server during our entire stay. We thought of trying the Chantilly Cake, but after realizing what we'd have to put up with we just decided to pay. After not being able to get someone's attention again (even when calling out!) we got up, paid at the cash register, then drove off to find dessert elsewhere.     From the moment we walked in to the moment we left it felt like we weren't wanted there and the people working could care less. When I read through Island Flavor's other one-star reviews on Yelp I found out that those people's experiences were very similar to mine. I don't understand this restaurant. It's like they deliberately ignore and sacrifice certain customers just so they can give everybody else the VIP Hawaiian treatment. Okay fine, I don't really expect to be given the same amount of attention the regulars get, but when it gets to a point that they start ignoring the basics of simple service (just to prioritize some customers over others) then that's not right.   For those of you who were able to enjoy yourselves and give this place a glowing review, I hate and envy you very much.",

I love to get the korean chicken, kalbi combo with kalua pork, ahi shoyu poke and of course their chicken katsu loco.  I occasionally get their specials... which are amazing! In the past I've had their beef stew special, shoyu chicken special and their smoke meat special! Portions are massive, so come hungry! I really wish their oxtail soup had a bit more taste to it, because driving to the cal downtown is a bit of a drive to get my fix.   Definitely one of the spots I have cravings for every now and then, and would recommend it to anyone looking for good Hawaiian food in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "I find it quite hilarious that I thought I was calling in an order to the Hawaiian takeout place that's in the same shopping center of the Vons at Warm Springs & Durango (I had ordered takeout there before but had forgotten the name). I called the order in and then, when I saw the address, realized I had ordered from a different place!    Being a business owner myself, of course I didn't want to leave my order uncalled for so I went down a few blocks and retrieved my order from Island Flavor. What a pleasant surprise!  I only ordered two plates: chicken Katsu and kalbi beef (?). The question mark is there because I swear when she confirmed the order it sounded so different than how I had pronounced it.   That beef was insane! So tender and delicious. The Katsu was good as to be expected at other Hawaiian places I've been.   I will definitely return and I'm glad I made that mistake! I actually hate macaroni salad because I hate mayo, but this was decent and had great onion flavor.",

Kona Mud Pie and Guava Chiffon. They have live music on Fridays as well and the ambiance is just like being in Hawaii.  Also important, they have Poi on deliveries Thursdays. It sells out fast.",

You cut your mouth up just eating or your jaw hurts from chewing so much on the first bite. It's so unbearable. SOMETIMES it is good when I order, but most of the time, it's like a dig gnawing at a bone. They should have like different levels of how to deep fry the furikake chicken. Somethings like when ordering a steak. Where they ask if you want it medium, rare, or something like that... I don't know about this place...",

    "text": "What I had: Mix plate = Roasted pork (w/ gravy) (left) + Souyou Chicken (right) + 2 scoops rice + Mac + drink = $14+  The waitresses are nice and attended to me 3-4 times. The \"big one\" has a strong Hawaiian vernacular which I liked  THE GOOD: Better roasted pork then most other hawaiian places, covered with gravy loco moco style while other Hawaiian restaurants actually use hamburger patties for their loco moco. I prefer this roasted pork, reminds me of turkey and gravy and will PUT YOU TO SLEEP - I saw someone on here complaining about it being mostly fat - He must've gotten the bottom of the barrel because mine was mostly meat with only 1-2 pieces of fat - HUGE Portions - bring a toothpick ;)  The Souyou chicken is like a bowl with ACTUAL chicken breast and leg pieces in the soupy teriyaki-like thick broth. Not too sweet which is good cause teriyaki can make or break a dish... teriyaki taste was perfect, not too sweet, not too salty - This was on special because it was thursday and it was $9 by itself - but the waitress was kind enough to suggest i get the mix plate with that on it instead which was only $13 (before drink(s) - the chicken skin fat was ACTUALLY EDIBLE... unlike L&L BBQ which is veiny, super fat and makes me gag. Great food period  The mac and rice were decent but nothing to brag about  THE BAD: The \"Tropical flavor\" ice tea was disappointing because I was expecting something NICE - it was REALLY just passionfruit ice tea and it was bland and not even sweet. I had to add a couple Splenda packs to make it good  All-in-all I would highly recommend this place. It may seem pricey but the portion size will leave you stuffed and makes it well worth the money - You could NOT eat all day, then eat one $14 meal here and be stuffed.",

    "text": "I've tried a number of Hawaiian restaurants in the valley and by far this is my favorite. The expectations of this place really lives up to the hype with everyone on yelp and word of mouth. Service was pretty standard the day we visited and there was a good sized crowd eating lunch. My mom and I brought the little girl we babysit throughout the week and we ordered fried poke stack, mahi mahi salad, and grilled chicken.   Fried Poke Stack- this had a really good flavor. I'm guessing it was cooked with sesame oil and soy sauce. The portion was plenty enough to share which is why my parents were able to taste it. My parents enjoyed this as well because they believed it had a very homemade like-taste to it.   Mahi Mahi Salad- really delicious dressing is all I can say. The only thing I would ask for is it would have been better if they used cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a tomato into quarters. But loved the dressing once again.   Grill chicken- didn't get to try this because we ordered it for the little girl. But it came with three fillets.   Banana bread- I was really excited to try this because Ursula U. had raved about it in her review. It was pretty good, but not the best that I've tried or anything I would crave for. It could be because it's made with Cinnamon, which is something I'm not a big fan of.   TIP: everything is ENOUGH TO SHARE. Even if I'm a big eater, the portions here are huge!  Can't wait to come here to try more. Absolutely love it and recommend to anyone no matter what side of town you live on especially if you're into Hawaiian food.",

First off Momma at the counter is a fun and funny as anyone I've ever met.  The service is a bit slow so I factored that into the rating but not in a bad way.  Just in a you need to ask them for it if you want it way.  But they are always, always happy to get it for you.  My favorite is the Chicken Katsu Moco Loco.   My girl likes the Kalua Pig and Cabbage.  We have also tried the  Moco Loco, Chicken Katsu, Kalbi, Chicken Teriyaki, and Poke.  Everything is magnificent.  I have to admit, somedays the seasoning seems to be off.  Either not salty enough or too spicy.  This only tells me everything is being made fresh and it shouldn't bother me but it does.  Still I give high marks to this place and like I said I've been hitting this place up 2-3 times a month.",

The place is family owned, with the family being from Kona on the Big Island.  Portions were huge.  The oxtail soup was to die for.

    "text": "I wish I could give a zero star from our experience on how my family and I were treated last night.  We got to the restaurant about 730pm and had to put our names on the waiting list because it was a Friday night and a little crowded.  We were told there was two parties a head of us and it's going to be around 20 minutes or little longer which is fine since we drove all the way down from  northwest las vegas.  We waited outside with the other two parties and  ten minutes had past and one party was called.  About twenty minutes later a young couple arrived and went inside but never came out so I'm guessing they must have tables available.  Its about 8:15 and we have been waiting for 30 minutes now outside in the  mid 90s heat so my wife went inside to check how much longer the wait would be but come to find out our name was crossed off the list and the couple  who had came 10 minutes after us was already seated.  So I asked the gentlemen at the counter the one I had talked to when i first put my name on the list why my name was crossed off and he said that someone said you had cancelled....REALLY!  Someone else had said I cancelled not I   but someone else.  I was shocked that I was told someone had cancelled our names that was not me. And the young man tries to blamed this on us and then says that there was still a bigger party ahead of us which I knew but that wasn't my point.  If you are running the front counter and the list pay attention to who comes first and who is waiting especially since you have a big window and can obviously see outside because there was no room inside to wait.  My point was that the customer who came 10 minutes later were already  seated on a table seating for four when they were a party of two.  Our name was put back on the list but we never got I'm sorry we made a mistake so we home.  I wish I was writing a review on how good or bad the food was but we will never get a chance because my family and I will never go back.  We are from Hawaii and always support Hawaiian own business but never been treated like that before.    B.D",

Over a year ago, after my first visit here, I was so pleased with my dining experience at Island Flavor I felt this place deserved to be found out about.   I've been here now well over 30 or so times, and have tried about 90% of the menu. Everything has remained consistent including the food and service. Only change is they are now getting busier, it's often hard to get a seat!   My favorite dishes to date are the kalua pig, chicken katsu, korean chicken, Lau Lau, oxtail soup and the poki is great.   Things I personally have come not to like are the roast pork loco moco and the fried rice with Portuguese sausage, both a little too salty for my tastes, but many other people seem to enjoy them.  Perhaps my favorite part of being a regular at this restaurant is the overall family atmosphere which is very welcoming and relaxing. I'm always treated like I'm one of their own.  If you still haven't been here, there's a serious problem.",

    "text": "Why am I am giving this establishment a meager 2 stars? Short story: OK food doesn't make up for bad service. And bad service should never be present at a hawaiian restaurant. Chinese, OK. Hawaiian, no.  Long story: My sister was visiting with her baby and I wanted to take her, the baby, my dad and my brother somewhere near my area for a quick lunch. I found Island Flavor on my Yelp app and liked what I saw. It wasn't very packed when we came in and they had enough room for our small stroller. Immediately noticed our waitress seemed perturbed that we had brought the stroller in. As we sat down, my sister noticed that her child needed a diaper change so she asked the waitress if they had a changing area in their restroom. Nope. But that was ok, not all restaurants have this luxury. So she took her baby back to the car to change her there. She was back in around 10 minutes and as soon as she sat down, our waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order. We look up at her quizzically because I was sure that she saw my sister just sat down. The waitress scowling then adds, \"Are you ready? Yes or no?\" I chose to ignore her curt behavior at that moment. My sister quickly made a decision and we got our food.   The portions were very plentiful. My dad and sister's order of kalbi ribs was pretty good. My porkchops however were bland and were not grilled as how I imagined porkchops would be. My brother's chicken barbecue was just OK but not as good as other hawaiian barbecue places. After we all got a drink refill, our surly waitress never came back to check on us. I even had to ask for the check from another waitress who I overheard talking to another customer. I believe she said that the owner was at the cash register and that our sour waitress was apparently the owner's daughter. Well, after what seemed like forever, the entire restaurant is almost empty and no waitress to take our credit card, we all get up and I hand our payment to the cashier/owner. I believe we have been perfectly reasonable customers and the baby didn't even make a big fuss so I'm very perturbed by this place. More unforgivable that an owner shows bad customer service at a hawaiian restaurant. The aloha spirit has left this building, folks.",

We read reviews that lines could get long especially at night and we were so prepared for that.  Just a little disappointed that we saw 3 tables empty but they couldn't seat us.  They just didn't have enough servers to actually accomodate the people.  All the servers were stressed, kept running around.  Nevertheless, food came out great.  It was as good as we expected and yes, oxtail soup craving satisfied.  DH had the kalbi and steak combo and it looked more like a family meal to us.  Furikake chicken and poke bowl was bomb.  I'd come back definitely, but probably at an odd time next time.  I wish they had a bigger place too.  Maybe it's time to expand! ;P",

It has rice, gravy, crispy katsu fried chicken and two eggs on top. My son had the kalbi ribs again and fried rice with a side of Mac salad. The portions are huge! Come hungry. Two dishes fed my family of four and we still have enough leftovers for another meal. The ribs were juicy, the heaping pile of fried rice was delicious and the Mac salad is always consistently good. I honestly have never had a bad meal here. The place does get busy but we were served quickly and the whole staff is always friendly and helpful. My coworkers like coming here every Friday and I join them sometimes, so at least twice a month we are here.",

She seemed to be more occupied with the girl at the register and seemed like gossiping. Food was so so, some on point, others salty.   The gal with the glasses is a keeper though and she seemed more knowledgable and patient than our waitress. We listened on her as she handled other newbies and my client says, \"wow, that gal is great, now why weren't we treated like that, weren't we good enough to eat here?\" We already live in a place that racially profile...didnt think this place would do that.",

The place is the real deal, best Hawaiian food I've had anywhere outside Hawaii. The crowd of people from Hawaii patiently waiting for a table in the Las Vegas summer heat at this unassuming strip mall of storefronts is testament to the quality of their food.  The people are sweet and friendly. Service as quick as can be with the crowd they manage along with the steady stream of phone-in orders coming in. When we came there was live Hawaiian music which set the perfect luau, sit diwn fir dinner with family mood.  The poke is the authentic kind, four flavors: sesame, spicy avocado, shoyu, and Hawaiian style - not the overly trendy kind popping up all over the mainland. Available in half pound or full pound.  Their laulau was is moist and perfectly seasoned and balanced - not too salty or fatty. Proof that it is fresh and made inhouse not frozen or reheated. Their kalbi has that great savory charbroiled flavor, not the overly sweet teriyaki that most Asian lunch joints try to pass as kalbi. The rest of my group shared the loco moco, chicken katsu, Hawaiian roast pork, and furikake chicken and wiped it out!  The servings are huge! Suitable for sharing by more dainty appetites but just right if looking to have a kanak attack!  Quick tip: avoid Friday dinner hours. Lines and waits are the longest then.",

Second time eating there, first time checking in with the Yelp app. Their Furikake Chicken is reason enough for you to be a regular at this place. Whenever I see a customer not eating the Furikake Chicken, I think, \"Come on maaaang\" O_O.  I did try the other stuff too. The Roast Pork is nothing spectacular and their fried rice is soy sauce with char siu pork. Again, nothing spectacular.   Their Kalbi though is amazing. Tasted way different that any Korean or Hawaiian kalbi I ever tasted.   So heres the dream team mix plate you want to order everytime: Mix plate with Furikake Chicken, Kalbi, and white rice.

Tonight I went to order my favorite ribs. I get home open my containers and have some kind of dry supposed honey hoisin ribs with onion rings on top. When I call back thinking there must be some kind of mistake . I am told they took the old ribs off the menu and these are the replacement dish and how they come.   Gravy per the wife still the same but so far we notice small things are missing and food isnt as good and no love in the reastraunt anymore.",

    "text": "I love days like today. I love it when I discover a fantastic place that serves tasty and flavorful food, with generous portions, providing friendly service, .....and all at a good price. Today we discovered Island Flavor!   In an effort to try as many different things as we could we each ordered a Mixed Plate Combo (which comes with your choice of 2 meats, rice/or fries, salad/or mac salad.) ($11.25 each, with an added charge of $1.00 for kalbi). I ordered the kalbi and teriyaki beef while my friend ordered the furikake chicken and hamburger steak. We both had the white rice and mac salad as sides and also ordered a side of fried rice with portugese sausage.  - Portion sizes are very generous! We actually ended up taking some of the food to go because we quickly realized how much we had ordered! lol Very filling and very satisfying! - I tried all 4 meats and have to say that all 4 were tremendous! The teriyaki beef and kalbi certainly stood out for me in  big way. These are going to be two items that I will be ordering quite frequently in the future! So juicy and each item packed so much flavor! - With that being said, this was my first time trying furikake chicken and I was not disappointed at all! Very crisp outer layer and juicy, meaty, and tender inside! The hamburger steak was also some of the best I've had in recent memory! - Service was fantastic from the word go! We were acknowledged and seated right away. Refills were taken care of in a friendly and expeditious fashion. Everyone I interacted with was friendly and smiling. I can't think of a way it could have gone better from a service standpoint. Very, very satisfied.  This is a slam dunk as far as I am concerned. You can bet that we will be here many times in the future for both dining in and taking orders to go! What a great find!  I love days like this! Now I'm ready to lay down and take a nap after eating all that  delicious goodness!  5 stars.  As good as it freaking gets!",

It is a busy place so I recommend calling in your order and picking it up, the tables are always filled. Prices are decent and service is good. I have had their food twice. The chicken furikake was a good texture when I first had it, the 2nd time it was way over done or fried. Too hard to eat or enjoy, but I will give it another go, at a later time. Love the Hawaiian store next to it!",

Upon getting there, we weren't even acknowledged until the party that arrived after us were. We spent 15 mins waiting for someone to ask if we needed a table. In addition to that, my party & I waited for over an hour for our food. By the time I got up to tell a waitress we were leaving, the waitress advised my order ticket STILL hadn't made it to the cooks. To make matters worse, somehow my order was not filled but tables that were seated after us, had their order taken and got their food before us. It would make sense to me if my order was complicated, BUT IT WASN'T. You know it's bad when those other tables around you take notice and say, \"eh, you guys came first, ah?\" OR \"you guys never get your order yet?\" The cherry on the sundae was not even getting an update on the status of our order. Our waitress disappeared and finally a host came and asked if we needed water. Since we had been waiting I asked the host for musubi's to which she said, \"to go?\" because she thought we finished eating!!! I had to tell her we didn't get our food yet and had been waiting. It's not a large restaurant, the fact that our table was overlooked throughout most of our time there is just ridiculous. I don't know what needs to be done on the restaurant/owners end but, something needs to change.",

I didn't see Lei, so I left. Lei was always the server I had for the last 6 years I have been coming. After seeing these new reviews I understand why. In the past you could feel the Aloha from everyone. They were a family and you could see it, they treated the customers as if they were family. It's so sad how many of the staff that were there for years were not there. They made the restaurant comfortable, just like home in Hawaii. We go to Island Flavor for the Hawaiian food and the comfort of Ohana that the staff had. Even though you are the owner of the restaurant, without your loyal employees, you will not have a business. Employees make the money for you to have a business. The employees are the back bone of any business. How can you treat them so disrespectfully? As a Hawaiian, or as I have read in another review \"You Hawaiians\" have the best work ethic and customer service! For the servers that lost their job, they are the reason we come to eat and enjoy the place that makes us feel like we are home. This is why people who do not know and understand the Hawaiian Culture should never buy a Hawaiian restaurant. I will never come back!",

Busser doesn't even offer refill with my wife's drink...  But come on now, all they need is to improve the customer service, you have great food and the only missing piece is the great customer service, crack a smile atleast and make your customer feel at home specially your representing this great hawaiin food.",

    "text": "Yesterday was an epic random celebratory luncheon.  Try saying that 5 times. LOL.   We all know how I feel about this place.  Love it.  The food is total comfort.  The staff is AH-MAZE-ING.  I truly feel like I'm back home in Kona, Hawaii when I come here.  Partly because the owners and most of the staff is also from my hometown.    The ONLY suggestion I have for this place is to expand.  Either expand the current location or expand to another location on the east side of town.  When we arrive, there was a wait and the entire restaurant was filled.  Maika'i Island Flavor!  Business is booming.    I got the mix plate for 10.50- In my mix, I chose the chicken katsu dip and roast pork.  The chicken katsu is perfectly breaded and then drenched in their Korean sauce.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!  THE BEST chicken katsu I've had.  Every time.  The roast pork.  Believe me when I say that the roast pork outshined the katsu for me.  Tender, marbleized and served with a light brown gravy.  I didn't want that dish to stop for me!  For dessert, I got the Kona coffee mud pie slice for $5.50 and the Chantilly cake slice for $5.00.  The price sounds a little steep but trust me, you get your monies worth.  These cakes are served with whipped cream and both, a raspberry and lemon drizzle.  I'm in heaven.  The Chantilly cake is like a German chocolate without the coconut and the mud pie is an orgasm in your mouth LOL.  The Oreo cookie crust held this monumental slice of heaven together.    Although everyone at the table got so many different things, my cousin got the shoyu poke which I have to rave about.  This poke was accompanied with onions, green onions and soy sauce.  If you've ever had the fortunate opportunity to try poke, you need to get this dish.  The raw chunks of tuna were fresher than fresh.  The soy sauce was perfect for the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  This place always does it for me.  It's a shame I never go as often as I should because of the travel time.  When I do though, I'm always confident that my entire experience will top notch!",

We drove all over Vegas checking places out but only so-so--no flavor or too salty, too expensive and manini portions, no can cook rice--whaaat? So when we found Island Flavor only a few miles from our house in the southwest part of town--oh, yeah! Generous portions for the price, great variety and taste, local dishes on-point--Zippy's should get lessons from these guys! Even the sides are great, like the mac salad and green salad--the dressing is some secret recipe and supa ono! Crew working there are really friendly and make you feel like you're ohana, even crack jokes with us, which is so welcome. Wife loves the furikake chicken and Korean chicken, while I like everything but their beef stew is broke da mouth (special on Saturday only--made me wanna lick the bowl!) and the Hawaiian style roast pork (gravy all over--awesome!). We bring friends from Hawaii here, and they all agree that Island Flavor is aurite!! So go check'um out!",

My boyfriend and I have been looking around for some local hawaiian food and found this place on Yelp (and also recommended from some guy that we met at another island food restaurant, who is also from hawaii too).   Anyways, we were not disappointed. FOOD WAS AMAZING and plates were HUGE. We were only able to finish half of our plates. I would recommend ordering the FURIKAKE CHICKEN, AHI POKE, FRIED POKE & BBQ KALBI plate. Looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes, and hopefully save room for dessert this time haha.  Other than that, it made us feel like home with the island music and friendly staff^_^",

Most places charge $20 just for the ribs but for $14 you get some great ribs and 2 sides. Suffice to say I have a new rib place.  Don't think they are being rude if you don't \"feel\" the service, They treat you like family which feels really good. Aloha spirit is all over this place and it feels pretty good.",

I usually get the Chopped Steak w/onions and Korean wings.  The taste is very sweet and savory.  The chicken is crispy.  The Ox Tail soup is also very flavorful w/o being too salty.  The Guava Cake is extraordinary.  I know they get it from next door, but it's Island Flavor's recipe.  The guava is infused in the cake batter and you can taste a hint of it with every bite.  Not too over powering.    The service is great and they also refill your Guava or POG juice!  If you are feeling homesick and miss island food, this the place to go!",
