    "text": "Great cheap food in the Vegas area within walking distance from the Palms Place and the Palms Hotel.. The food is authentic but the service is quite slow as they are short staffed at this restaurant.. There are only about 8-10 tables so it's not a very big place but it's never really packed so you get seated right away.. I'm used to getting my pho within 5 minutes of ordering but this place takes forever! The only reason we returned again and again was because it tasted great.. The waiter has a bit of a language barrier so communication is a little difficult but for the most part we were able to let him know what we wanted after a few tries.. He was very accommodating when it came to our multiple requests for extra cilantro, lime, and bean sprout.. Everyone loved their food during the three times that we dined here this past week and we would return again for sure!",

I had the shrimp and pork combination vermicelli and was disappointed in the pork meat; rubbery, fatty, and not as flavorful as other Pho restuarants.  The shrimp was good, and the side of egg rolls we ordered were fairly large and tasty.  But meat is a big deal and when its rubbery, it rubs me wrong!  But 3 stars for great shrimp, egg rolls, and super tasty broth!",

    "text": "After a hard weekend of clubbing, drama, barfing, crying, yelling, barfing, and more barfing, some girls in our group decided we needed to finish off our weekend in Vegas with pho.  We had a long drive to look forward to so right before check-out, we Yelp'd the closest pho spots OFF the strip.  That is how we found ourselves at Da Lat.  It's a small spot in a strip mall past the Palms.  It looks like it's a family operation and it did take a little while for our food to come out.  No real complaints though bc it did it's job.  I ordered the large pho tai and it was tasty and filled me up.  I think we all felt rejuvenated after a meal that didn't cost an arm and a leg in Vegas.  If I were to return to Vegas (not for a LONG LONG time I hope), I'll most likely visit Da Lat again.",

    "text": "So who would have guessed that July 4th weekend is the weekend where 10,000 Vietnamese people from all over the US gather to watch Paris By Night (a rip off of MTV's Music Awards in Vietnamese). Wrong weekend to crave Pho indeed because all the Pho places I'm familiar with in Vegas were jammed packed.   This place is the definition of hole in the wall. My kitchen in Vietnam was bigger than this place. But to find a nice diamond, you have to dig through all the coal.   Hands down the best Com Tam (broken rice bbq dishes) in Las Vegas. You want to stick with the pork chop. Moist, tender, smoky and beautifully charred marbling. The rice is soft and buttery. The egg rolls have this taro meat combination that is quintessentially Vietnam.   The Pho is definitely top notch. The slightly oily broth has this homemade feel to it that only people who have actually made Pho at home can understand. Fresh Pho will have these floating oil micelles because it hasn't been strained over and over and over like typical Pho places. This type of Pho will sing to some and scare others. I'm a native, so this type of Pho holds dear to my heart.   Conclusion: Everything is fresh and HOT! Yes HOT! I can't stress enough that temperature is key in Vietnamese cooking. Every dish that is cooked with fire needs to be served HOT! Steamy! This is the only place in Vegas that has that concept down. I just wish the decor is nicer; then I can bring my friends.   next visit - order Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Noodle Soup).",

    "text": "Small Pho $6.50 Large Pho $7.00 Eggrolls $4.50 to $5.25 ?? READ 5th Paragraph.    We walked into Da Lat hungry and had a major craving for Pho! We were greeted with a smile, and seated right away. The server was really nice.   We ordered 3 Small Combo Beef Special Pho, 1 Large Brisket Pho, and Eggrolls as an appetizer.  The eggrolls arrived and there was nothing special. The eggrolls just came with lettuce. There were no mints, pickled carrots/radishes, and cilantro. I was extremely disappointed. But, I was super hungry and ate it anyway.  The Pho is just OKAY. I added a bunch of sauce to make my Pho taste just right. There was plenty of meat and it filled me up.  The Bill came and I saw the Eggrolls were charged at $5.25. On the menu, the price was $3.50. I asked the waitress about the price, and she said it cost extra for lettuce. I was kind of annoyed that she didn't let me know ahead of time. Therefore, this incident ruined my experience at Da Lat and I won't be going back. Sorry!   After I found out, lettuce was extra. I made sure using my credit card didn't cost extra just in case I was SURPRISED again.   I don't care I got charged 75 cents. I just thought it wasn't right for her not to let me know I was going to get charged while I was placing my order.",

    "text": "Too much MSG, that pretty much sum it up.   A friend and I ordered Pho and a noddle soup along with some chicken wings. The soups were tasty and a little bit on a sweet side, and you can definitely detected MSG taste in the broth. The chicken wings were a little bit salty when eating by itself, it would be great if there's some veggie to munch along with it.   By the time I was done eating, I got headache and my mouth dried up, which confirmed the MSG suspicion. The headache lasted through the next morning. I can handle a little MSG, but not when they use lot lot lot of it.   The restaurant itself is clean and people working there are very friendly. The parents run the kitchen and the daughter works up front. She was very friendly and attentive, which is a huge plus.   Overall, if (a lot of) MSG doesn't bother you, this place can give you tasty (MSG makes everything tastes better) food. Another options would be trying their rice or dried noodle (bun thit nuong) dishes, which I will do. Will provide update after I try it.",

Favorites & Recommendations: Pho Tai  **Grilled Pork Chops w/ Rice = So flavorful. My favorite dish =]  Service: This place is pretty small, and sometimes pretty packed during peak lunch time (noon-1pm). However, every time my boyfriend and I have gone, we got seated right away. Service has always been good also.  Wrap-Up: Da Lat will always be my go to place for my favorite dish (grilled pork chops w/ rice) and for some good pho.

    "text": "Pretty good! And another great late-night option for the eats. My wife and stopped by after most everything else was closed. The place isn't too big and is located in a small plaza a bit further away from the strip. We checked-in to get the free eggrolls, I ordered the bun bo hue, and my wife ordered pho tai. The bun bo hue was pretty good - they put a lot of good stuff in it (pork blood, pork leg, flank, etc). My wife thought her pho broth wasn't as flavorful as she's used to. The eggrolls were OK. I also ordered a lemon soda... it wasn't very soda-ey though. My wife noticed the server running around trying to find the ingredients to make it. She said that, at one point, he pulled some Mountain Dew out of the fridge and asked someone in the back (in Mandarin) if he could use that to make it. Apparently, the cooks in the back seemed to understand Mandarin and speak Cantonese. Not sure if Vietnamese is even their first language (there was another Vietnamese couple who had to ask the server \"Do you speak Vietnamese?\" and proceeded to speak to him in English).  I was surprised at the prices - more expensive than the pho places in Irvine! I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas, and for some late-night eateries. They had a sign on the wall saying something along the lines of \"Pho...the best food for a hangover\" - nice... I think we were hungover from the 15 hour Grand Canyon tour that we had just gotten back from 30 mins earlier. Well, now I know where to go when I'm starving for pho in the middle of the night!",

As for the food..........they need to bring in a waaaaaay better chef or kick the person who gave them the recipes that are currently being used.

Their water pitcher was a coffee pot. Uhh...anyone want coffee water?  I guess they get a star for trying. I'm scared to try other pho places in Vegas. I think I'll just stick to pho in San Diego.",

There was a good proportion of beef to the soup, and at 7$ it was amazingly inexpensive.  The taste of the Pho rivals any restaurant I have eaten Pho at.  It's not an impressive place, more of a coffee shop atmosphere, I'm pretty sure the server was the son of the owner and he was filling in on a non-school day, it took a very long time to get my Viet Coffee (he forgot) but the Pho made up for any little serving issues.

I really wish I lived nearby. I would love to come during the day as they serve a  a few traditional Vietnamese items such as banh cot up until 6pm.

I always order bun bo que and I was shocked the dish was horrendously bad this time around... The cooked beef was so big,  like a piece of cookie, that  I literally have to shove it into mouth. Its like the chef,  they don't even bother to cut it up into smaller pieces... And the most important thing, the pig feet(gio hero) has alot of HAIR on it. How do u expect your customer to eat with hair on their gio hero? In the past when I ordered bun bo que,  there was no hair on the gio hero but tonight it was a completely different outcome.  I ask the waiter(which I must say gave me exceptional service) and he told me the chef told him this batch of pig feet that came in this time around,  it comes with hair like that... So u telling me they don't have the decency to remove the hair from the 2 pieces of pig feet that came with my bun bo que dish?  How could u serve gio heo with hair on it and expect the customers to eat it? It is so inedible and disgusting... I was soooo disappointed with the food and the excuse  the chef gave me regarding the pig feet(gio heo). I won't be coming back here anytime soon...",

Even for happy hour the bowls of chicken pho were huge, tasty, and just straight up good.  Happy hour is everyday from 2-6pm, and for dine in only!!!   Sorry To-Go orders.

Don't forget your yelp check-in for 2 free egg rolls.  The egg rolls were so good we bought 20 egg rolls for a dinner gathering later in the day.  Ok last thing, their Vietnamese hot coffee comes to you In a plastic cup.  The coffee does not come in the normal coffee press like other places.

    "text": "Pho: Probably the best hangover cure to mankind. And Da Lat is the perfect and convenient haven to alleviate that nasty headache of yours.  My friends and I woke up from an epic night out in Vegas, and upon getting up, my friend instantly requested pho. Finding Da Lat was actually a bit of a challenge, since it's hidden in a plaza and it's a small family owned restaurant. But lemme say... it's worth the troubles! The food was absolutely flavorful and delicious! The food took a really long time to come out, which was quite torturous. It was weird that the pho came out last, since it's usually the first.   Some highlights: - Their raw meat appetizer was pretty good. Interesting... since it's my first time trying it. - Got a dry noodle dish but switched out the noodles with rice. Yay! The waitress was so nice about it! - Waitress was really friendly and quick on her feet - The pho you order comes with a lot of meat (huge tendons!) - Apparently they ran out of some type of meat for my friend's Bun Bo Hue, but replaced it with other goodies and more meat - everything was gooood AND cheap! - they accept credit cards! A+! - be prepared to wait awhile for your food though..  My only disappointment is that their rice dishes are smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants, but I'm not complaining since the deliciousness made up for it. I got the chicken, eggroll, salad combo... eggrolls were seriously baby-sized... and I ate every single grain of rice since the portions were pretty small. Oh well.  If you wake up with a hangover and hating yourself from drinking too much, head over to da lat - you'll love yourself afterwards.",

My friend ordered spring rolls, which were 2 tiny rolls cut in half. That took a good 40 minutes to make. (BTW, there were barely any other customers, so it's not like they were busy making other food!)  The rest of us ordered pho, which took nearly an hour for it to come out. We would've bounced the fuck outta there if we didn't feel so bad for doing so. So we just stayed because we were hungry and waited that long already.  When we finally got our food, it wasn't even that good! The broth was piping hot, which was nice...but that's probably what they were doing this whole time...boiling the soup. My friend mentioned that they \"forgot the flavor.\" Yup, the broth had little to no flavor. Plus, my rare steak tasted sour, which meant it was probably old and should not be eaten!  People who have rated this restaurant anything better than 2 stars have not eaten GOOD pho before. Also, if you were drunk/hungover when you ate here, I'll excuse you because of the lack of judgment.  Lesson to be learned: Don't eat pho in Vegas!",

Sure, it's not exactly healthy with all those carbs from the vermicelli noodles or the fried egg rolls or the fish sauce or large portions of meat. But it sure is delicious.  Today's stop was Da Lat, a small shop a couple blocks west of the Palms, in a strip mall. The dining room is full of tables with not a lot of space to walk in between. You can sit at a table and wait for service or walk up to the counter and order for takeout. I opted for takeout.  Bun w/ egg rolls and BBQ pork ($8.10) -- excellent, silky-smooth noodles; thin, tender, sweet and savory pork; good, but small egg rolls. The dish could have used more veggies, as there wasn't enough cucumbers and no carrots that I could spot; a few sprouts and some mint rounded out the dish.  The service was quick and very friendly. The girl behind the counter was nice enough to chat for a bit as I waited for my order (Pho Saigon 8 should take note of the friendly service here). I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Da Lat is and exceptional Vietnamese restaurant run by a very kind family with and extensive and authentic menu and kind understated service. We enjoyed a huge lunch here on a recent trip to Vegas in late September. The Pho here is the star, and rightly so, with most people opting for it, but I was equally impressed with the wide menu of regional dishes from Vietnam. Whomever cooks here is very gifted and it's easy to see why this place was packed at lunch on a week day.  We enjoyed the following:  Appetizers:  Fried Egg Rolls - Hot, Crispy, filled w/ Shredded Pork. Served w/ a side of Fish sauce.  Entrees:  Banh Xeo (Half Moon Crepe) - Vietnamese Crepe filled w/ Shrimp, Beef, Scallions, Bean Sprouts & Fish sauce. On the side it was accompanied by a garnish tray w/ Carrots, Radishes, Thai Basil & Lettuce Wraps to combine all of the ingredients in one mouthful.  This was HUGE! I loved everything about it but it was somewhat messy to eat.   Pho Dac Biet (Special Beef Combination Soup) - This included Meatball, Tripe, Tendon, Rare & Well Cooked Beef along with Vermicelli Noodles in Beef broth. Served alongside were garnishes of Jalapeno Peppers, Bean Sprouts, Thai Basil & Lime. The flavors were smoky, beefy, and rich. This Pho was absolutlely stellar.  Com Bo Cuon Tom (Shrimp Wrapped In Beef) - An elegant and delicous little Vietnamese Surf & Turf combo served w/ steamed White Rice, Cucumbers, Tomatoes & Lettuce.  Everything we ordered was at least very, very good while the Pho Dac Biet and Banh Xeo were amazing.    The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that try as I might I couldn't get past the fact as mentioned in some previous reviews, the floor was really, really dirty! Old food, dust and dirt littered the floors underneath the tables which was hard to miss. Kinda gross even though the tables were very claen and they had and A health Code rating displayed. That being said I would still return to have another bowl of that addictive Pho Dac Biet and to explore this menu in greater detail. I just won't be looking down near my feet at all.",

    "text": "Pretty juicy vietnamese restaurant In LV  I didn't order Pho so my review is based on the rice dish which I thought was pretty good. Price was decent. Service was decent. Drink was not good.   The bathroom goes in back of the kitchen which I think is gross since you see all the kitchen mess. But the food itself is pretty clean and flavorful and a good stop for a hangover.   I wouldn't mind coming back here again when I'm in Vegas. It's definitely better than a lot of the Vegas Pho joints and cheaper too.",

    "text": "During my grandmother's visit to Las Vegas, she requested to have Pho for dinner one night.  I asked my cousin for a great recommendation and she suggested this place.  I knew this place was close to Marbella where I've visited before.  Since we were downtown, this seemed like a good choice.   The place is a small, cozy location.  Two columns of tables, no more than 4 rows of tables deep.  There are laminated pictures of the menu and other pictures on the wall, made it seem very cheap.  There's a server stand in the back, however, it seems too high and cluttered.  The server was patient with our family which goes a long way in my books.  She allowed us to bring in alcohol from the nearby liquor store, as long as we had the receipt.    What really turned me off was the bathroom situation.  They directed me to the back of the kitchen.  You literally had to walk through the kitchen, while the cooks were preparing food in order to get to the bathrooms.  What was worst was someone was already in there.  I had to wait outside the bathroom, in the kitchen, with the cook.  OMG.  When I got in, it was cluttered with supplies.   Aside from that, here's what we got for our meals:  Grilled pork chops for $7.50:  Marinated grilled chops, served with a scoop of rice and tomatoes and cucumbers.  The pork chops were sweet and although the chops were a little on the thin side, it was still juicy.    Special combination beef pho for $7.50:  Beef noodle soup with a combination of beef meatballs, beef slices and tendons.  Served with sprouts and basil on the side.  This soup is super flavorful and they give a lot!  Noodles were soft and plentiful :)  As you can see, the food is very inexpensive.  It's actually super flavorful and probably will bring me back if I'm in the area.  I don't necessarily think I would go out of my way to come back.  The first experience I had there was a little bit of a turn off.",

    "text": "would give this place negative infinity if i could. decided to give this place another shot and still kicking myself in the behind for it. my family of four came in, the restaurant full. The waiter at the counter ignored me, so i went up to tell him that i needed a table for four. we waited 15 minutes, another party of 3 comes in. after one table leaves, they wait FOREVER to clear the table, but the waiter was going to seat the party of 3 first before my family! NO YOU DON'T! Needless to say, I got my table.   We sat down and I told the waitress that we didn't need the menu as we already know what we want. She replies, \"you still have to wait\", and walks away.   10minutes later, she comes back to take our order.   So it took 20minutes for two pho sate and one mien ga (clear noodle chicken soup) to come. It took 30 minutes for a pho combination to come!!!! I've NEVER waited more than 10minutes for a pho. The porportions have shrunk, the food saltier and more oily. Found some bugs in my soup too.  the chicken in my clear noodle chicken soup was so tough--worst than jerky (like it's been refridgerated for weeks). The mints for the pho were all wilted (like reused veggies),  While we were waiting, I was able to witness how inefficient and unsanitary these people were. the waitress at the counter (the same who took our order) was preparing ice water--She actually stuck her entire hand into a pitcher of water to remove a big junk of ice. Then when she poured some ice on the counter, she picked it up with her hands and placed it back into the pitcher. GROSS! Then we witnessed a mother and son party come in, they waited 15minutes, but instead of sitting them when a table was ready, they sat a table of 3 that just came in. The mother and son approached them and all they said was sorry, can you wait a little longer??? When she got piss and left, they just smiled and said, \"have a nice day\". Idiots!  Is it so hard to have a waiting list? They had plenty of cooks in the kitchen, why did it take forever for the food to come (it's not even cuisine food!) The food has declined drastically and the portion shrunken, not to mention how unsanitary things are. The service is SLOWER than before--there is absolutely no organization. This place needs new management.   Fortunately I will never be back to see that day.",

    "text": "They are an amazing family owned restaurant.  I was in Las Vegas visiting with my family and was craving Viet food.  My family ordered Pho + Bun Thit Nuong Cha Goi and they said the food was really tasty.  I ordered Banh Hoi.  It comes with BBQ pork strips + shrimp, lettuce, different Asian mints, dipping sauce, and rice vermicelli bundles topped with scallions and peanuts so you can make wraps.  I couldn't believe how tasty this meal was.  If you like Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls) or enjoy making the occasional burrito, then you have to try this!  This meal is meant for you to create your own wraps!  I eat crazy things so the shrimp tail is not an exception.  I couldn't believe how tasty the shrimp was :D If you like to eat shrimp, you'll appreciate the way they prepare their shrimp, whether you eat the tail or not :D  I walked thru their kitchen to use the restroom.  I saw their family working together and they looked so happy.  It is such a blessing to see young people helping their parents out.  You just don't see that anymore.    The restaurant is not super big, but that's never important to me.    Great family = Great service.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for lunch after a long night of partying at Rain Nightclub. This place was introduced from a buddy, Davis Duong (master yelper), he chose this place because it had the highest rating on yelp...figures. The place had great parking (lots of spots) and was very average in size, it could probably fit about 25 people max?   The price for the pho was around $7. Now the portion wise, it was pretty decent. It doesnt compare to the OC/Westminster/Garden Grove money-proportion, but for Vegas, it was pretty good. The food was delicious, didnt seem like it had too much MSG (usually i knock out from food coma after a bowl). The soup wasnt too heavy, and the noodles werent too soft and mushy. My favorite part of the bowl was the meat...the meat tasted especially good here for some reason. Even though I only had one bowl, when I really wanted 2, this place is my favorite so far in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Great Service, the lady who worked at the cash register even told me that a lot of customers found out about this place from yelp.  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

I think one of the things this place has going for it are its late hours and good pho (which is the best post-drinking faire, in my opinion).  The broth is well made, albiet a bit greasy, and the meat is tender. All pluses in my book!  P.S. The boba in this place is a bit stale (hard rather than chewy), so if you're opting for a smoothie or a tea, nix the boba.",

Our group was a bit skeptical to try out this place, but it was one of the few Vietnamese places that still opened after midnight.  The place is small and quaint.  Two of us tried the Bun bo Hue, the other two ordered Pho.  After I first tasted the Bun bo Hue soup, my eyes actually lit up!  It was THAT good.  The broth was hot and flavorful, and the meat is cooked just right.  However, for their pho, my cousins said that they've had better and the noodles were a bit under-cooked.  Definitely a must try if you're in Vegas :)",

My special favorite is how they grill the meat and shrimp to perfection where the fat melt off just enough and is slightly crunchy to the tongue and yet is completely tender that you can just bite if off without really needing a steak knife.  The staff are always friendly and helpful, and their prices are incredible.  For just an extra dollar or two you can get tasty high qualify restaurant prepared food here compared to how much you would have to pay for a combo meal at any fast food chains.  Out of every single restaurant of every type that I've eaten at, this is my favorite one and eating here is the biggest thing I look forward to whenever I go to Vegas.",

I'd prefer if I just got some pickled cabbage in there, but my sister liked it. Their shrimp was cooked perfectly. The pork had some hard parts, but was good with the tangy fish sauce you pour over vermicelli meals. The chow fun was thin noodles, unlike the Chinese equivalent, which made it lighter overall. The spring rolls were pretty average. We didn't get pho because it was delivery, but I'm excited to taste it in the future!",

There was only one server for about 8-9 tables. Needless to say he was quite busy. Nonetheless, very nice. I ordered the vegan pho. It arrived within 5-10 minutes. It was full of veggies and tofu which was a nice surprise as previous places only had veggies in the vegan pho. It was delicious!!!! And quite large so I had to take half of it to go. I would definitely come back if I were sticking around.",

I ordered this for delivery.. I thought the soup came put together, but no... I had to do it and there were so many options!  They gave me sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos, limes, onions, cilantro, hoisen sauce, siracha sauce,  and the noodles.  I just experimented and thankfully, it turned out so good!  Then I got the combo platter with chicken, pork, sausage, and shrimp... the FLAVOR on all this meat is amazing!!  Now that I have an idea of what all this is, I'mma definitely gonna be a frequent customer!  I also got egg rolls and crab wontons, as they were the only \"safe\" options on the menu incase I didn't like the rest.. and they were awesome too!!  Basically, everything was sooo good!  And, there was tons of it at a great price!  The only negative is that I ordered thru Yelp, which kicked it to Grubhub... estimated time was 40-60 min, but it took 92 min.  I blame Grubhub on that though.",

We ordered chicken wings, pho steak, and combination rice plate. I also got the two free egg rolls with check in.   The egg rolls and chicken wings came out first. The egg rolls were freshly made and very crispy. It was delicious, especially with the fish sauce. The chicken wings were seasoned well and I loved that each wing came with a lime for it. There was a water jug at our table for our water refills which was convenient. The pho steak was really good. There was a lot of noodles and steak. I was too full to finish it. The combination rice plate was perfect esp when I put the egg on top of the rice and break the yolk.   Overall this was a great experience and lots of good quality food for the price. This is definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants.",

I didn't catch his name, but he was very friendly and upbeat. He was very attentive as well considering he was the only server in a full dining room. He showed me to a table and brought me some water and a menu. The water comes in a carafe that sits on the table so you can refill your cup as many times as you want. I love that! I browsed the \"morning menu\" (they have another menu after 11pm)  for a bit and decided I wanted to try the nem nuong, which are pork patty rolls, and the rare beef pho.   Within 10 minutes of ordering the nem nuong came out. I have never had anything like this before but they were quite tasty. It was similar to a spring roll, but instead of shrimp there was pork, and it was warm, not cold. Not long after a huge piping hot bowl of pho came out with all of the accompaniments. There was a good amount of beef and noodles and I happily ate myself into a food coma. Good food, good service, and they have an extensive smoothie/milk tea/boba menu, so I will for sure be back for that.",

Last time I visited Da Lat, I was suffering from Bronchitis and needed the delicious and medicinal value of Pho Ga coupled with Jalapenos and Sriracha sauce to provide some temporary relief.  Well once again I am sick - this time I am on the tail end of a cold/flu virus - going on week two - with a really congested head. So I headed to Da Lat!  Had the Pho Ga - added all of the herbs/veggies: Jalapenos, Bean Sprouts, Lime, and Basil. Added lots of squirts of Sriracha saucer to eat bite. Delicious! And definitely got my clogged up head temporarily opened up.  Absolutely rich, aromatic, delicious, Pho Ga!",

Anyway, I'm in Las Vegas for the holiday weekend. My luck, there are passing thunderstorms thru the valley which means I'm in the mood for some type of soup dish. Ramen or Pho. Ramen lost.  The place wasn't too bad - small little hole in the wall joint not too far from the strip. Not walking distance but still not that far.   The service was OK. The girls, yes plural were friendly enough. Very helpful but forgetful. I had to ask them to remove a Thai Ice Tea that I ordered but never received. They were genuinely apologetic which was nice.  The food wasn't too bad either. I ordered the Dac Biet as I like \"the works\" when I have Pho. The broth was flavorful. The noodles were consistent and the additional ingredients were plentiful. The only thing - the price was more than I'm used to paying for the portion size I was given.  All in all an OK experience. I'll have to visit again to see how the rest of their menu holds up to what I'm used to.",

I like the little kick in the chicken, lemon grass flavor just hint of it not much, and compliment with sauted onions too green onioons along with the chicken. It came with nice portion of rice and some slices of tomatoes/cucumbers for garnish. The prices are very reasonable on all there dishes, great size portion for the price, and if any item gets confusing most or all comes with picture. So whether fan of vietnamese food or not Da Lat has something for everyone. Place that would come back too again.",

Went with bf and a friend and shared the spring roll and egg roll appetizers, then had 2 phos and the combination vermicelli bowl. The portions we received, as well as those we saw going to other tables, were enormous- none of us finished our dishes, even after sharing.  The phos had a very flavorful broth and plenty of meat, and the vermicelli bowl included both BBQ pork, shrimp, and additional spring rolls. All dishes were hot and fresh, and the rolls were crisp and not soggy in the least, as at other places.  Also had two Vietnamese coffees, both super strong and delicious as well. The menu also boasts a huge selection of smoothies and bobs drinks, if you come thirsty or feel like dessert afterward.  Service was attentive and prompt, despite multiple tables and a single server. Combined with the great good quality and the great Groupon deal, make this place a great place to try.",

There was also just one waiter. This guy really needed some help. Service was very slow. He took orders, made all the drinks himself, handled checks and payment, and delivered the food. Not sure how many kitchen staff there were either, but food service was also very slow. At other Vietnamese restaurants, pho noodle soups often come out faster than they could fry up egg rolls, but here at Da Lat, I felt like we were waiting a long time for our noodle soups.  Despite the slow service, the pho tasted delicious. The noodles were firm and chewy, while the soup was flavorful and not too oily. Each bowl came with a good amount of meat and the vegetables were fresh.   Price: About $8 per bowl of pho.  3.5 stars.",

    "text": "I've avoided trying pho in Las Vegas for a long time after two less-than-stellar experiences. However, with my mom in town and a Groupon conveniently available, I felt that this was the right occasion. So was the third time the charm?  No, but it was probably the best pho I've had around here yet. It still doesn't quite measure up to San Jose or SoCal, but it was pretty satisfying. They even provided ample amounts of the Asian basil, sliced lime, and bean sprouts that you'd expect. The broth was heavy on the anise though.  However, I did experience some of the service issues that are prevalent in other reviews. For one, the lady in front didn't move to take our order or otherwise mention that we might have to wait or walk up to the register. I went ahead and did the latter. The subsequent wait for the food felt pretty lengthy - maybe in the vicinity of 15 minutes? To be fair, apparently they were filling some sort of giant to-go order in the back before we had arrived, but they've gotta be able to churn out pho faster if that's one of their mainstays.  Other than that, $12 was pretty darn pricey for my large (xe lua) bowl. But I guess they're all overpriced around here, and this is a reasonable quick fix for a homesick California boy.",

Second time, we dined in. Ordered a small canh chua ca kho, banh xeo, & com tam 5 mon. The canh chua was huge for a small size!!! Banh xeo was only offered certain time (that's why we went that time ). I came there wanting to try their bot chien but sadly they ran out that day. Oh well maybe next time. Everything we ordered hit the spot. Delicious & flavorful. That's coming from someone who's from lil saigon in SoCal. If u have a Vietnamese food craving while in vegas, this is the place will hit the spot. Tried a couple other places before. The food was aiite. This place got my comfort food (canh chua) AND it was actually good. And if u check in on their yelp, u get 2 eggrolls!! Which btw, wasn't some crappy cheap free eggrolls. It was actually good too .   SERVICE: 2/5 The only reason why I gave 4 stars is cuz service was just the typical azn service. They weren't rude or anything. Was just slow & not as attentive as I'd like when it wasn't even that busy while we were there. There were a couple other customers there when we first got there but midway thru our meal, we were the the only ones left. Oh well I'm used to the azn service.   DECOR: 1/5 They could work on the ambience a lil bit. There was a shelf behind the register that was all empty. Decorate guys! I was confused thinking whether they're getting ready to shut down the place or not. Hope not cuz I like their food.   Overall, if u have a craving for good viet food then come here. If you're not used to the typical azn service & care for ambience while u eat then just order to-go. This place is very close to the strip. Right down the street on the Rio & Palms on Flamingo.",

But I came again about a year later, and it was just not the same. Broth is too sweet and meat is less tender. The plus side is you can customize your bowl of pho to have whatever type of meat you want in it! Wish they had that option for all pho places haha.   To my surprise, it was renovated and the inside became much more modern and clean. The seats have been updated to cushiony sofa like chairs with a bright red color. Tables are a sleek black, much better than the old ones.   Verdict... Not the best pho, but doable if you're looking for that hangover cure in Vegas!",

    "text": "Here is an interesting piece about Da Lat. When I first moved here to Las Vegas, after driving for 3 days and over 2000 miles, Da Lat was the first restaurant I ever ate at in this fare city. I thought it was one of the best pho's I've ever had, and ever since then, it has always been in my top 3.  Over the next several years, I've had the opportunity to come back here on several occasions. The Vietnamese crepe, bun bo hue, and every other items that I've tried were some of the best that I've ever had!  Well, I came here the other day wanting to recreate some of my past experiences here. I noticed on yelp that they have new hours, and they are open until 4am, when they used to close a lot earlier. And I came in at 2am. When I walked in, I noticed that they had done a complete makeover of the place. It had turned into a more sleek and modern vibe, rather than the previous mom n' pop feel. The waiter told me that even though the restaurant went through a renovation, the owners are still the same owners.  After scanning their menu I noticed that the prices are still the same, which is good because I thought Da Lat always gave great value for what you got. But, it looks like they have taken their awesome crepe off the menu.. Darn!! So I decided to go with the pho.  Combo beef pho - the broth is still as good as I remember, you can taste the beef flavor as well as the spices commonly used in a good broth. The meatballs and brisket was good and plentiful. I can't remember if there is any rare beef that is supposed to come with the combo, but I didn't receive any and I don't have a menu with me to check.  So here is the big reason that this is not a 5 star review. They brought out the traditional accompaniments for the pho; bean sprouts, Thai basil, and sliced jalapenos. The bean sprouts were turning brown, limp, slightly slimy and smelled off. The basil was dried up. And, the jalapenos had a dried up as well, noticing the white on the outside. I made the mistake of adding these items to my great soup, and it ruined everything. I've never had this problem before, but I usually have come in at earlier times, when the husband and wife are in the kitchen...  I would come back here, but probably at an earlier time. I don't know who is working the menu at late-night, but they need to be trained on what is acceptable and not acceptable to send out to the customers. Oh, and bring back the crepe!!",

But that's a quibble.  The broth was rich and hot. They didn't skimp on the beef or the meatballs.  After adding the beef, you really didn't have a lot of room left for the noodles or the bean sprouts/vegetables.  Which was OK in my opinion.   The broth was rich and the beef was just right.  Not too tough, but enough of texture to contrast it with the broth.  Overall it was a surprisingly good experience",

    "text": "After a weekend in Vegas, we decided to cap off the weekend with some Vietnamese food since we were craving it and also to nurse some hangovers.   Between 3 guys we ordered the following:  1. Pho Dac Biet 2. Bo Tai Chanh 3. Goi Cuon 4. Com Dac Biet 5. Pho Ga   Slight over-ordering? Nah, not at all - YOLO!  Both varieties of pho were good. We asked for some ginger sauce for the pho ga, which made the dish super delicious.  The broth for the regular pho was surprisingly really good.  The bo tai chanh, goi cuon and com dac biet were decent but nothing to write home about. All in all, a good dining experience.  If you're looking to cure your inevitable hangover from the chaos from Las Vegas, I'd definitely recommend Da Lat.  On a side note: The waiter recommended the Bun Bo Hue  - I'll definitely try this next time.",

Their spring roll was probably the worst one I've had. It super doughy and thick. Fillings were bland. Grilled shrimp was fresh and huge. Grilled pork was also great with BBQ flavors. They gave great portion of vermicelli. However, we tried to order Banh Xeo, Bot Chien and Banh Beo but they did not have anything...I mean why would you put on menu if you dont have any item. Bun Dan Biet was great with the fish sauce and I def got full because of the portion. They were also out of meat spring roll. I think they should improve on replenish their inventory before open.",

Banh Mi Dac Biet - big enough to share, tasted ok as the bread felt and tasted a little stale.  2 Special chicken pho - soup tasted clean, but the chicken was over cooked.  Com dac biet 5 Mon (5 items, grilled pork, chicken, egg roll, shrimp, and Chinese sausage) - kids loved it.  Bot chien - first time and probably our last. It's just fried eggs with crispy.noodle cake.  Of course I checked in and was super happy I got my free egg rolls as well.  Yes, I will be back.  Huge menu selection and so little time. Yumz",

The customer service was amazing, but we received tap water with no ice so that was a bit of a bummer. The meat on the rice plate we ordered was pretty oily and made it very unappetizing to eat. We ordered spring rolls and it was smaller than I usually receive them from other Viet places, but their egg rolls were pretty good. I also got the 2 free egg rolls for checking in. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls was delicious though. The soup orders my party got was pretty good, but I feel as if there was much more soup than noodles and meat within it. Although there was many flaws, there was free wifi, the area was clean, great customer service, and some foods were pretty good, this place deserves a 3 star rating.",

We ordered 20 egg rolls for a party for $25 cash at the end and they packed it nicely for us. The flavors were good but I think the frying oil needs to be changed because the egg rolls picked up the old oil taste.  They have happy hour food and drink specials. You can get a chicken pho (pho ga) for $4.95. If you order two Thai tea based drinks, you can get he third free. My husband was so excited about the leas than five dollar pho, haha!   Their pho is huge! The amount of chicken was decent but they really threw a lot of noodles in there. I added a side of brisket, which came in it's own broth. The broth had a richness to it, so it is oily and a bit salty but delicious and the way I like my broths to be.   My Thai tea with no boba was strong, sweet and creamy. I liked the sealed lids to really mix it around.  All in all, service was good, prices more than reasonable so I can see why this place was staying busy during our visit. They offer yelp cash back with a registered card here and check in deals so I would take advantage of those deals when you visit.",

I've come back for their pho sate many times and it has never disappointed. For those who aren't familiar with pho sate, it's pho with a peanut chili sauce added into the broth. It is so rich and delicious and an absolute must-try in cold weather! Da Lat also makes classic Vietnamese street foods like banh beo and banh bot chien, two of my favorites. They prepare their banh bot chien stir fried with eggs and green onions which reminds me of how my mom used to make it for me when I was a kid. The service is always great when my boyfriend and I come in and the servers are always cheerful and willing to make recommendations. Can't wait for our next visit :)",

Two tables came in after us, and they weren't given forks.  Then, when the There were only 2 take out orders our entire time there.  It took 10 minutes for the cha gio that came out with only lettuce, no other greens.  I had to ask for mint and basil.   We waited almost 20 minutes for 2 bowls of pho and 2 orders of bun.  20 minutes...  Pho was also served with the least amount of sprouts and herbs I've ever been served.  I asked for fresh lemonade and was told they don't have any.  To top it off, I was violently sick within 30 minutes of eating the pho.  This has only happened a few times before when the stock is loaded with MSG.    I have never been so critical of a restaurant, but this place was such a disappointment given the positive reviews and the size of the Vietnamese population in Vegas.",

My friend had a coconut-based soup with a little spicy/tangy flavor good for a cold night. I ordered the grilled chicken vermicelli bowl which is a lighter choice if you don't want something too hearty. The egg rolls are huge with a lot of stuffing. Highly recommended  If you want a quieter and cheaper place to eat off the strip, this is definitely a place to go. Just keep it to yourself, so it doesn't get too busy that you have to wait for a seat :)",

The restaurant itself is pretty small. Only about 5-6 tables I believe. This is def my go to carry out for good Vietnamese food.",

Thought that was kind of weird but we seated ourselves since there were only 2 employees in the entire place.  The food that we ordered minus the papaya salad which they were out of, so kind of disappointed on that but oh well is absolutely wonderful and it you want real Vietnamese cuisine, you will be hard pressed to find it elsewhere.  Our waitress was very friendly but did seem to disappear for long periods of time(see above comment) and maybe she was cooking too along with serving and hostessing.  The only real bad part of tonight was the black guy who came in soliciting for donations not only from her but from us and the other customer.  A good hostess would have booted him out immediately.  I think the best idea is to call in your order and pick it up to take home.",

I enjoyed the Lemongrass chicken and my wife had a personalized Pho combination. Both entrees were satisfying and full of flavor.  We also received 2 complimentary egg rolls for checking in.   All in all, the food is great and you get the feeling of dining in a small mom & pop shop. The only concern I'd pose is if have a delicate palate or you require a server that caters to your every whim; the service can be a bit slow at times.  However, I enjoy the change of pace and welcome a slow relaxing meal from time to time.",

    "text": "Another successful Yelp find and another pho place to add to my list.  Da Lat is a no frills Vietnamese restaurant. The decor is sparse to non-existent. As soon as you enter, you are welcomed and directed to a table. Tony T is right - there is only room in there for about 34 people (I counted the chairs). The service is very quick. I always go for the combination pho whenever I'm at a new Vietnamese place. The lady brought out my water quickly, took my order quickly, and before I knew it, my bowl of pho arrived at my table.  The first thing I noticed was that the soup was piping hot. I went straight in and tried the broth before adding any hot sauce. It was bursting with flavor and felt very full-bodied (for lack of a better term). I like how they have the homemade chili sauce as opposed to just Sriracha. I put in a spoonful of that and went to town. My T is right. In addition to being piping hot, the soup has a certain oiliness to it and this was also evident in some of the meat. It's something that I neither loved nor hated. It was just there. I did enjoy the pieces of tendon and the tripe. The tendon was very, dare I say, tender.  Overall, it was a highly enjoyable bowl of pho. I rank it towards the top on the list of places I've tried in Vegas. Based on the soup, the quick and friendly service, and the place's simple charm, I'm inclined to give it 4.5 stars and generously round that up to 5.",

Sadly I live in bfe now and have a later schedule so I haven't been able to have it in a while. I've been to Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, Jenni Pho, WtPho and Pho Annie and no place compares. The last time my bf an i went we were greeted warmly and chit chatted while waiting for the to-go order (I'm never a fan of making a server work when it's 30 mins to close) and we learned it's a 3 generation family recipe. I'm vegetarian and bf is not, so fair review from both sides. Nowhere in this whole city has vegetarian broth that isn't somewhat bland, and their beef broth is so clear and fragrant that it doesn't even make me wrinkle my nose from the beef smell (nearly impossible). I always feel great after eating it, and the portions are big enough for me to have some later. I generally eat healthy, green stuff and this is one place where I can actually FEEL the quality of ingredient and recipe in my body after I eat it.  Their boba is on point too :) I literally recommend this place to EVERYONE looking for somewhere that isn't greasy \"as fu**\" like some of those other late night places. Pardon the terrible pun haha",

    "text": "I had never thought of finding a Pho place in Vegas even though I have been known to venture far off-strip for groceries, food, pharmaceuticals, etc.  So I turned to my trusty Yelp community and chose Da Lat for my next trip to Sin City. The perfect hangover cure, I thought!  So on Saturday morning, after a night of boozing and schmoozing, my friends and I hopped in my car and drove the 3 miles to Da Lat expecting a refreshing bowl of noodle soup. One of my friends opted for the Subway next door and brought her foot long club sandwich over to Da Lat to join us. She had finished it before we even received our Pho.  Reviews on here made it sound like a crazy, busy place so I was worried that we would have to wait in line forever. Luckily, when we arrived it was nearly empty except for one group of 8. We sat down and a very nice, young, teenage girl took our drink orders. She returned quickly with our drinks and took our food orders.  We ordered fresh spring rolls to share, fried rice to share and each of us ordered a large bowl of Pho. I also ordered an iced Thai tea. The tea and spring rolls arrived quickly. The tea had a funny taste (more than usual) so I only choked down half of it. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh. We devoured them. Then the fried rice came out and I took a chance and ate it. I didn't feel sick afterward so it must be GF safe. The rice was VERY salty and greasy. Good fried rice will always be greasy but it doesn't have to be salty. On the plus side, it was loaded with different veggies and meats. The salty rice filled us up and we were slowing down and getting tired by the time our Pho arrived.  My friend's Pho arrived about 5 minutes prior to mine. Presumably because my broth had to be hotter for the rare beef. The bowls were MASSIVE. I always order the biggest Pho a place has, but these were just crazy. Each of us finished about 1/8 of it before the salt caught up to us. The add-ins that were given weren't as varied or abundant as many places I have been, but they still did the job. The broth was probably the oiliest I have ever had. The entire surface was covered in oil droplets. Not appetizing. Regardless of its appearance, it still hit the spot and we went home for our MSG induced nap. I awoke and ate the remainder of my Pho. Somehow it was better at room temperature.   I am not giving this place 5 stars because the teenage girls who served us did not wear their hair in ponytails and it looked like they had just rolled out of bed. I understand that it is a small, family restaurant but a little bit of hygiene goes a long way. I don't want to think about hair flipping in my food every time I watch the server rush back to the kitchen. I can only imagine the cleanliness level of the cooks.",

It receives a distinct but we'll balanced flavor from hints of ginger and black pepper in the savory broth. I loved that the broth stood on its own and was not an attempt to replicate the flavor of beef broth. I'm would order this dish again in a heartbeat! One note about the place: it doesn't receive much dine-in traffic. But, don't let that put you off; while I ate, four different food runners came I to pick up hefty take-out orders :) Lastly, the service was attentive: my meal arrived quickly, and my glass of water was always full.",

Then I take half of the noodles (they tend to stick unless you eat them right away), boil them in there and viola! Perfection.   Eat with sriracha, bean sprouts and a smile. :)  P.S. - Their fresh spring rolls and milk tea are also delish!",

    "text": "WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!! I wish I could give less than 1 star.  My friends and I came here for a late dinner after attending Rise Lantern Festival. This place was nearby our Airbnb and seem to have good reviews so we decided to give it a try. There were people there but it wasn't a packed house. There was 9 of us & we were seated right away once we got there (we had to split the party though) and given menus and then everything went downhill from there.   There was one guy working the dining area. After he sat us down and gave us the menus, we didn't see him for over 10 minutes. I flagged him down to let him know we're ready to order and he says he has to finish cleaning a table so he can seat 2 people that were waiting. So we were fine with that. When he came for our order we ordered 4 bowls of pho (2 pho tai and 2 pho dac biet) and 1 bo luc lac rice dish. After he took our order, we did not see our food for 40 FREAKIN MINUTES! I have never waited 40 minutes EVER in my life for a bowl of pho. Which by the way was TASTELESS and had NO FLAVOR. Such a disappointing bowl of pho I have ever had.   And to make things worse. Before we even got our food, the table that he was cleaning for the couple had gotten their food first before we did!! That made us so mad because we were already waiting for over 30 minutes and this couple that came after us got their food before we did??!! WHAT THE EFF!! So I flagged the waiter down & told him that we were here before the table that has their food and he said it's because they ordered something with fishballs and they had to make that first because it's takes long. Which was a lie! Because the other half of our party sat next to that table and they said they just got pho. And even if they did get something with fishballs, why would they even get their food first before we do?!   At first we tried to be understanding because we noticed that a lady came in and gotten a huge takeout order so that was probably what was taking the food so long to come out. But when we saw that another table that came 10 minutes after we did get their food first, UNACCEPTABLE!  There was also no tripe in the pho dac biet and it states on the menu that there is tripe in that pho bowl.   If I didn't come with a big party and with people that were exhausted and super hungry then I would have just walked out.   Save your money and go elsewhere because even if we didn't go through that hell of getting our food and waiting forever, I would still not come back because the pho was not even good at all. I don't get why everyone is saying the pho is so good and flavorful. I must've came on a really crappy night then because after all the waiting we went through, the pho was very disappointing.",

We thought why not try this restaurant since it had a 4 star rating.  We were wrong !!!  We came in and were seating promptly, but we never had a server again to take our order until 10 minutes later.  We had to flag the server down to take order even though the restaurant was not at all busy. The menu items we wanted to order half was not available.  No coconut !  They sold more than 1000 Groupons, I expected them to be ready for a crowd.  There was another item on the menu that I ordered was not available, but I forgot what it was.  Anyway, we ordered four items:    egg rolls (soaked in old oil), Vietnamese chicken noodle soup ( had a strong sesame taste, which kill the flavor of any chicken), beef noodle soup, which was fine, and a rice dish with pork meatloaf, shredded pork, and charbroiled pork ( never came until half an hour later that we reminded them that we were missing a dish).  There were 2 servers  with around 10 tables in the restaurant.  They have to serve, make drinks from scratch, buss tables, bring out the order, etc.  Now when new guests came in I had to tell them that \"you have new guests coming in,\" that was when I knew this restaurant was way unorganized.  I could feel that other guests were disappointed too.  Most guests had to wait so long for order taken.   The decor of this restaurant filled with sceneries from Vietnam, could have filled with lots of photos from Da Lat.  We had to literally walked through the restaurant kitchen to get to the restroom (filled with cleaning chemicals and open electrical outlet). I wished that this restaurant would have run by a Vietnamese family instead of Chinese because the food didn't reflect Vietnamese, at all.",

Most pho places don't have sate that just dissipates in your bowl. Makes my pho all red, spicy and deeeeelish! The server doesn't quite understand Vietnamese so he brought me onions instead of hanh dam (vinegared onions)...oh well. Can't win everywhere!  Large bowl of pho was $7 bucks! A great deal in Vegas. My other friends bought the banh canh and bun bo hue which came out to about $8.50 a bowl. I would pass on that because I can find it for much cheaper AND better back in OC. But the pho and sate?! You have to try it while you're out there in Vegas.  Service was great and pleasant. Servers were really nice and made sure we had all the appropriate accommodations.

We were kind of in a rush because we had to make it to a pool party so I didn't really get to sit and enjoy it for as long as I would have liked to. The spring rolls were really good too. They have some of the rare beef and shrimp rolled up in them served with that amazing peanut sauce I love so much. Only gripe, they didn't bring out raw onions with pho. Should have tried asking but my boyfriend told me to spare the people at the pool party dragonbreath from the onions.  Its not on spring mountain road like all the other asian restaurants.

It's in a small, clean spot located in a nondescript strip mall adjacent to the Palms.    The menu, unfortunately, wasn't that exciting --there are some broken rice, vermicelli, and seafood dishes, but nothing too unique.  Their pho options are good, chicken and shrimp were an option that I've rarely seen.  However, the broth wasn't as flavorful as I like--it lacked spice and oomph.  The bean sprouts, herbs, lime, and jalapeno, however, seemed really fresh, which was great.  We also ordered egg rolls with lettuce, which were \"blah.\"  The lettuce that came with the rolls was fresh but I wouldn't recommend ordering this particular dish.  Also, while eating, Chuck Liddell (UFC, if ya don't know) walked in and took a seat.  I always imagined UFC fighters eating plates of raw meat for instead of spring rolls with jicama. Apparently he likes reasonably-priced Vietnamese food, just like the rest of us.",

    "text": "The spring rolls are really fresh and were my favorite item of the night and at $4, it was definitely a bargain.  I also had the raw beef topped with nuts, salad, and lime juice.  It was ok, but at $6.75 it was a pretty good bargain too.  The last plate I ordered was this shrimp and beef salad and I barely ate it.  First off, this dish did not look appetizing at all!!  I figured maybe it tasted better than it looked, but it turned out to be really bland and extremely lacking any flavor whatsoever.  Moreover, the salad was basically the same salad that was served on top of the raw beef.  I felt like I dished out another $6.75 for a side of more salad.  I would not recommend the salad.  The environment is just like any quick service sit down restaurant.  It was well lit, relatively clean, and sorta cramped.  It's not a big restaurant.  Service was friendly enough.    Overall, this place was ok.  I think it's worth paying a visit if you love spring rolls.  I would like to come back and try some of their rice dishes and pho, but until then I still prefer pho kim long as my go to joint for Vietnamese food.",

When ordering I told them multiple times to not put certain things in my pho, which they acknlowledged. However, when the food came it was made incorrectly! I asked them nicely if they could re-make it or kindly cancel that bowl from our order. They insisted they could fix it...when the bowl came back 10 min later it looked like they had just scooped out the items that I had asked them not to put in when they could have simply made a new bowl for me. I barely ate my food because I could still taste the cilantro and other things that had been soaking in the soup. I would not have gotten mad had they simply just made a new bowl after admitting they screwed up. Restaurants should not be so stingy when it was their fault in the 1st place. I will never be coming back here due to unprofessionalism and lack of customer service!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place after seeing it online and moving from SD to LV and missing my Pho place. I researched many different places for Veggie Pho that is served with Tofu since I just prefer my soup that way. I finally order it through DoorDash with a Thai Tea and I was impressed. All of the ingredients came separate so that they are as fresh as can be when it arrives. The Thai Tea was a little strong for my liking and wasn't as sweet, but I would definitely try the Thai Milk Tea next time to see if there is a bit of a difference.  The Pho itself was delicious. I know that if I would've eaten in the restaurant I would've liked it even more (I like it add a lot of Sriracha and lime juice!). My dislikes were actually the Tofu, which I was sad about....I had seen other pictures where the Tofu wasn't cooked at all but mine were seared on both sides. With it being cooked it made the Tofu VERY chewy and inedible. That was my least favorite part about the dish and I didn't end up eating them. It doesn't change how I feel at all about this place but that is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five. I plan on coming back here and trying it in person! I will update my review then. Yummy food and great portions.",

    "text": "Surprising not bad.  After reading some reviews and hear from some other people about their pho.  We thought we would give them a try.  It's a hole in a wall place, but the broth is the best so far from the 15-16 other pho spots we had tried in Las Vegas.  Service is good too.  It was a little weird when we first walked in. There was only one table looking at the menu.  We weren't greeted.  One kitchen staff came out and looked at us and walked back in.  \"IT WOULD HAD BEEN NICE, IF THEY SAID SOMEONE WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU!\"  Lol, about 5 minutes later, we saw a male and a female walking in from taking the trash out.  Then we understood what's going on.  It was around 9:30 PM when we came in.  Safety first. =)  I'm happy to see the waiter actually took his time to wash his hands before coming back on the front to serve guests.    He dropped off the menus and water for us right away and took the other guests' order and came back for us.  Everything came out quickly. We tried their spring rolls, egg rolls, and pho combination.  The spring rolls were good, but only had one thin slice of pork and 1 small shrimp that was sliced in half.  For $5.95, I would think it's a little pricey....for the amount of meat you're getting..we got a total of 2 shrimps and 2 thinly sliced pork.... some noodles and veggie for this order.  The egg rolls were good and tasty.  The pho was good overall.  Fresh ingredients, fresh meat, they had the good kind of meatballs, the fresh noodles, good portion.  We will definitely come back.  We won't order the spring rolls though.  LOL  The place had a rush that came in about 20 minutes after we came in around 10 PM.  There was only one table left open.  We saw a lot of togo orders too.",

This place is in a small shopping area close to the strip.  Their pho is fresh and WARM.  Been here twice already back to back nights (they are that good).  I highly recommend the caramelized cat fish (ITS THE BOMB).  I love the homey feel even if the place has their restroom in the kitchen.  Don't let the outside fool you.  This place is clean! This place is authentic. A lot of spots in Vegas worry about the aesthetics but this place pride themselves on the food. A MUST VISIT if you go to Vegas.  Food is AMAZING Place is CLEAN and SMALL Tables are NEAT Wait time for food is somewhat LONG but WORTH IT Price is reasonable Waitress is SUPER SMILEY AND FRIENDLY A must order Pho and the 5 meat special and catfish Parking lot is always EMPTY  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

One of our friends tried their pho. Legit broth. Loaded with taste and came out piping hot!  If you check in on yelp you will get an order of their fried rolls. Since it's free it tastes even better! Lol! But we tried their spring rolls and even this came out fresh and the shrimps were actually there! And tasty!  I was on a roll and picked up one of their viet dessert that I'm crazy for. The good fortune of finding a really good place to eat home made food continues with their dessert even!   Fast service. A little bit of a communication issue but nothing that can not be resolved by pointing to their pictured menu. There! Problem solved!   That door though... I'm like Pavlov's test. The Dog. It opens or it closes the bell rings. And when it rings...no matter what I look up. Must've done it like 50-60 times! Le sigh...!",

Morgan pulled up his trusty Yelp App (someday he'll write an actual review, I promise) and found Da Lat.    Oddly enough, I had just seen Da Lat last night on the way to a movie, and had wondered about the place.   They had decent enough reviews, so we headed over.   We got there right at 9:30 when they opened.   Let me tell you, I was really impressed.  The inside is super clean, bright, and very nice.    Service was polite, and pretty quick, too.    We ordered: The 2 free egg rolls with Yelp check in:  DA-licious! (see what I did there? lol)  Meaty, piping hot, put together really well.   AND, their fish sauce doesn't smell like death, which is a plus.  The fried quail:  OMG.  I've never had quail meat before, only eggs.  I liked the flavor a lot.  The meat was similar to duck: delicious, juicy, tender...  The Pho Noodle Soup with Rare steak:  Best pho I've had in a long time.  The noodles were perfect: a nice chew to them, not mushy at all.  The steak was delicious and plentiful.  Most places only give you a couple little slices of steak...there was a lot in this bowl.  Oh, and the bowl was enormous!  The broth was flavorful and hearty.    I can't wait to come back again. My phone was dead, hence no check in for me (we used Morgan's) and no pictures, because his camera was broken, but I will post some next time for sure.",

After every bite, I wanted more.  Came in on Sunday for a late dinner and tried their bun rieu.  Absolutely the best one I've ever tasted, besides my sister's homemade one.  We also got pho to go for my 8 y.o son, who's a picky eater.  He ate all his portions and asked for more the next day.  Got another take out of pho Monday.  We will definitely come back next year for more pho.  This establishment deserves 5 stars, but I tend not to give it a 5 until I am a repeat customer and it remains good.",

It's a small spot, so my family (about 30 of us, and yes we're Vietnamese) pretty much took over the entire restaurant. There was only one guy working the front of the restaurant so a couple of my aunts and uncles stepped in to help get us all water and utensils while the one guy took everyone's order. Considering that we filled the restaurant, I think the food didn't take too long to come out. A number of us also checked in on Yelp and he honored the free egg rolls for all of us who checked in.   The menu isn't as extensive as the Vietnamese restaurants I'm used to in San Diego. I ended up getting a rice dish and thought it was pretty good. My family and I really appreciated that they accommodated all of us, so although the service may have been a little slow, I think it was expected with such a large group of people. Everyone ate all their food and we're Vietnamese...so that must mean the food is good!",

Pho: It is so full of flavor,  you can tell the broth is boiled with bone marrow. Da lat combo : vermicelli bowl with bbq pork, grilled chicken and two egg rolls all for $8.95.  Lemongrass chicken : everyone recommend it from other reviews and trust me it  Sooo good... They even have milk teas, smoothies and Italian sodas to end your meal.  Plus check In gets you 2 free egg rolls!!!",

Their banh hoi tom cuon came with nothing but a plate full of old veggies and mints and maybe 8 pieces of banh hoi, 4 shrimps, and 5 pieces of meat. At a whooping $22 for nasty Vietnamese food.",

It looked liked a little hole in the wall and the interior was simple but the food was excellent! Their bo tai chanh is amazing and the price is half of what i paid in SF! I ordered the bun bo hue and it was a major hit! The chef is probably the mom because she brought the bowl to my table.  My gf had the egg rolls to roll up with her vegetables and she enjoyed it. Great place, will definitely hit up Da Lat a couple more time before we head home.",

It was nicely wrapped and the creamy peanut sauce was very good. If you check into Yelp at this restaurant you get 2 complimentary egg rolls and we did. Our food took a very long time because I believe they were short on staff and to top that off the cook didn't see our ticket. A customer that ordered to go after us got his food before we did. The lady that was sitting a few tables away from us told me. Overall this restaurant is a go to place especially if you're craving for a good bowl of Pho. Did I mention they're very generous with their meat portion? This restaurant deserves a 2 star because the guy at the register was friendly but service isn't fast.",

Definitely a no-frills dining experience, the food was good and the staff was very friendly. I had the combo Bun (which is pho but without the broth - a lot less soupy this way!) and the fresh spring rolls, which were great. Those two things and a soda and it was less than $16. Sure beats any deal I could get for a meal at the Palms! Definitely worth checking out if you're a Vietnamese food fan like me. Plus, they're open til 4AM so they're there when you are!",

First off, we unlocked the offer for free egg rolls which never came out. We had to remind the guy mid experience and didn't get it until after we had finished our meal. Upon being seated, we were offered the menu, but the server seemed so confused all the time. Every time someone would want to order something, he'd have to go check about something with the dish. It was really weird! He also tried schooling me on what kind of noodle dishes were what and the herbs to eat with it. Honey, I'm Vietnamese. I know what to eat with my food and what's supposed to be in the dishes. I guess my proper pronunciation of everything didn't give my ethnicity away? It was just an awkward vibe all around. I ended up with Bun Bo Hue, which they no longer serve with the pork blood cubes! Womp womp. I was really looking forward to that. My beau ordered the Pho Tai with Bo Vien (meatballs). The Bun Bo Hue was flavorful, spicy, and definitely hit the spot. It was a generous portion and had a lot of meat. The pho, however, was NOT pho! I don't know if it was an off day or something or people on here just don't know what good pho tastes like, but what my beau had to eat tasted nothing like what I grew up on. That was extremely disappointing since this place had such great reviews for their pho. Oh well, onto the next establishment!",

We also got the shrimp spring rolls, a Thai tea, a fresh coconut and for dessert the grass jelly with coconut cream.  All this was ~$30, the portions were huge, fresh, tasty & flavorful.  This was our first time ever having Pho or Vietnamese food so we don't really have anything to compare it to but we both feel that any future place we try will have a hard time living up to the food we tried here, especially considering the price and great service.

Not a big deal since we have been to quite a few good Vietnamese restaurants that were run by non-Vietnamese.    Bun Bo Hue: broth not as wholesome but rather salty and watered down.   Wish the soup was hotter (in temperature).  Small portion for $8.95.    Pho: broth came out piping hot (+1 star) but somewhat bland.  Did not feel good at all after finishing this.  MSG, possibly?

I ordered their fried chicken wings, pho special, and shaking beef. Pho broth was mediocre but not entirely horrible. They are very generous with their cuts of meats, noodles, and the condiments that come in sealed pouches like ketchup along with herbs. The fried chicken was not like fried chicken at all due to the marination which tasted like hoison sauce and lots of oyster sauce which turns the meat really dark. Not an element of an ingredient to use when frying. Flavor was okay, a bit sweet but it was more like a baked wing rather than fried. Their shaking beef was not shaking beef to me at all but more like a Chinese beef stir fry soaked in soy sauce and oyster sauce. I'm a foodie and a cook so I was not impressed. My fried egg that came with my rice tasted better lol. I basically trashed all my food which I hate to waste but just couldn't eat it.",

First the delivery driver was quicker than expected, and the food was pretty amazing. For pho being delivered I couldnt complain. All the pho add ons included (bean sprouts, mint leaves, srirachra, hoisin) as well as properly packaged, nothing spilled which was impressive to see. The oxtail was super tender and the broth was delicious on its own. The pork rolls were different but still good with the peanut sauce. The beef pho, was well its beef pho, you cant go wrong with it. Still good the morning after as well. Id definately order again from them",

I've waiting 15-20 minutes for a meal that I'd already pre-ordered.   Aside from long wait times, I love it.   The restaurant itself is pretty small.. seats maybe 20 people. So I wouldn't recommend big groups because they wouldn't sit too comfortably. Pre order and take out is probably better for bigger groups.",

So I went and told them I had a groupon. They asked me for the coupon and no issue at all. It was one waiter in the place and he was actually very on top of his job. He made sure that I was doing okay and had everything I needed.   However, I just wasn't feeling the place. I was quickly reminded once I started eating why I never came back.  special combo pho with extra tendon - The noodles were just too soft. Way too soft, I felt like they were extra soft for a child or senior citizen. That is the best way I can explain it. The broth wasn't bad,  but it just had this flavor to it that I wasn't fond of.   papaya salad -  I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. It was just plain shredded papaya mixed with shredded carrots and sliced shrimp. They served it with shrimp crackers and the server just told me to use the fish sauce at the table. But I wasn't sure how to use the nuoc cham with it. So I never finished it. I did eat the shrimp crackers though.  pork sausage patty roll - probably the best thing I ate. Or maybe not. The sausage looked a little under cooked. Other than that, it was pretty tasty.   So in the end, I really wanted to give this place a two but it wasn't horrible. I just didn't care for it. So this should be like a 2.5  It's a pretty small place so if you come with a big group it just might be a little crowded. The restroom is back in the kitchen. Just a little uncomfortable for me.",

I get the combo pho and it comes with EVERYTHING. Other places charge extra and the bowl is huge, imho.   Their boba here is good. Recently tried their Thia Tea (BUY 2 ~ ALMOND MILK OR THAI TEA & GET ONE FREE) and it is YUMMAS. Although I like icy boba, their warm chewy tap balls are delicious too!   As for customer service, I can't complain because I love their foodddd.  At the end of the day, this place is my go to for Pho / Boba!",

We ordered the BBQ pork and shrimp wrap, veggie Pho, Bun Bo Hue, Hainan Chicken, and the Beef Carpaccio salad.   The place is small and located in a strip mall. Plenty of parking. We got there around 11:45 am and when we finished the place had people waiting.   The raw beef salad was the highlight of the meal. Good portions and flavor.  Hainan Chicken was the worst I have ever had, DRY and pre-made then re-heated.   The veggie Pho was OK, veggies were imitation crab meat, broccoli, carrots and cabbage.  The Bun Bo Hue was bland, but had lots of toppings such as sliced beef, blood cake, pork hocks and noodles.   BBQ pork and shrimp wraps were very flavorful and goes well with the lettuce leaf wrap.  Ice Vietnamese Coffee was smooth and creamy.  Service was good, and the Food was just OK.",

So obviously I ordered the vegetarian pho and it has veggie broth as an option along with tofu, mushrooms, bok choy, cabbage, carrots and broccoli. The app however didn't list the ingredients of the pho so I would've opted for them not to add mushrooms but luckily the way it was packed I was able to pick the mushrooms out. I think it would be beneficial for the company to list the ingredients of the pho for allergy/sensitivity purposes for future customers. The noodles were terrible. They were all chopped up and I think it was because they wanted the portion size to appear larger but instead it wasn't a pleasant experience. More like chopped up noodles with delicious veggies. I also asked for extra sriracha sauce and I was happy that the restaurant provided extra sriracha packets. They're sriracha tastes like the Louisiana hot sauce packets that come with Chinese food takeout but nonetheless it has the right amount of spice that I need to amp up my pho.",

Received 2 free fried egg rolls for Yelp check in, and they were very average. Ordered the fresh shrimp/pork egg rolls served with peanut sauce and they were pretty tasty but still fairly average. We ordered the rare beef pho and the vegetable pho with beef broth. The vegetable pho was excellent and loaded with tofu and an assortment of fresh vegetables, definitely worth ordering. The rare beef pho was unfortunately quite salty which detracted from enjoyment of the dish, so basically ate all the beef and noodles, but left the majority of the soup, which is normally my favorite part of pho. Not sure we will be back here. I'm sure there are better Vietnamese options in the area.",

Like most good Asian spots, the service is definitely sub-par as we were left finding our own table, grabbing our own menus and left unattended to for the first 5-10 minutes when there was nobody out in the front. But, the food definitely satisfied my cravings.  My first impression was that their nem nuong was surprisingly good. I've found very few places around town that even serves nem nuong so it was a nice that they had it here. The sauce was quite flavorful and my fiance commented that it was even better than Brodard's (blasphemy!). The combo pho seemed small, but there was a generous helping of noodles and meat. I was surprised by how much meat there actually was as I quickly became full. If you're looking for a rice dish, the 5 item combo with rice came with delicious barbecued pork, chicken, beef, and a couple shrimp with an egg roll. Overall, a good find and will definitely be coming back.  Also check-in on Yelp will net you 2 free egg rolls, which were also well-fried and tasty.",

First impression was that it's kind of small with a few seatings but I noticed they're busy with take out orders.  Anyway, there was 4 of us and apparently our eyes were bigger than our stomach because we couldn't finish everything! Then again they did give big portions and definitely wasn't stingy with the meat..that's always a good thing!  I ordered the com thit nuong (beef rice plate) and wow did they pack all the meat. Very well marinated and definitely tasty! I wish it came with an egg and side of pickled veggies because that's how I usually like my rice plates but oh well. Maybe they'll one day take it into consideration.  Bot chien trung was really tasty and a great appetizer to share with others.  Bo tai chanh was not bad. I wish it had a little more flavor to it (maybe the first time I had it was so good so my expectations for it now was a little high)  My friend got the pho satay and he said it was good but really oily. He even had to scoop the oil out and put into a cup to see all the grease build up :(  Anyway, would love to come here again to try something else.

Seriously craving some Asian comfort food, I chose this place for a late breakfast based on the great reviews. SO GLAD we ventured here! The restaurant is small, but there are enough tables for patrons to dine comfortably. During our meal here, there was a rotating amount of customers and they gradually got busier towards lunch time. The server is super friendly, patiently describing all their specialties to us, serving us with a smile, and even telling us of other great local places to check out.  First of all, there's a Yelp offer for TWO free fried spring rolls - claim it! Secondly, they have a deal for buy two bubble teas and get a third free. This will cost you $8.50 for three LARGE teas. Get this too!  I tried both the Thai tea and Thai green tea -- both delish!  On to the food! We ordered the following: -Pho Dac Biet -Combo Vermicelli  -Bun Mam  Everything was so delicious!! My dish was the pho and it was soooo cheap (under $10) for a huge bowl FULL of meat. Like, there was so much food I shared two small bowls of it with my parents and still struggled to finish it. I also tried my mom's combo vermicelli and the pork and shrimp are busting with that freshly grilled taste. The free Yelp spring rolls I mentioned earlier? Homemade, full of taro, so good! They do not skimp on ingredients or quality here.   This was hands-down one of my best meals in Vegas outside of the strip...ever. Really, really great place - don't hesitate to try it!",

    "text": "A gem for sure, but hardly hidden if you're a local. The number of locals who came through while I was there definitely gave me confidence that I was in the right place.  This is a small place, but cute, there was only Ellen in the front, who seemed to know all the regulars and their orders. Food was made fresh to order, so it took a little while, but this isn't a place for the impatient. No one seemed in any sort of hurry and the wait was worth it.  I ordered Bun Bo Hue and Bot Chien. Both were really yummy! Soup was hearty and flavourful with a very generous serving of sliced beef shank. This is the first time I've had Bot Chien, but it's a lot like turnip cake at a dim sum restaurant but panfried with eggs. This version was piping hot and soft on the inside, nicely crispy on the outside, served with pickled carrots and a slightly sweet-salty dip. So good!  This will definitely be an LV fixture for me!",

And a Thai iced teaThe portions here are huge, and it's in expensive.  This review is an average of all 4 times, usually my food comes cold. Which makes sense for the spring rolls (duh), but not my pork and spring rolls.  However. The last time I got the wrong order and everything tasted different. Idk if they changed the recipe for the shrimp and pork rolls, but it was super fishy, VERY chewy, and the peanut sauce was super watery. I also ordered the same dish as always... but I got the combination beef pho instead... instead of pork vermicelli. Because this was delivery, I really couldn't do anything about it. Also, for pho, the carpaccio comes raw (that's how carpaccio is supposed to come) but it was bleeding into my other meats, and the broth wasn't hot enough to fully cook the beef, so I had to put it on the stove to reheat it. I rarely eat beef so my stomach was upset.   Please make sure you are sending out the right orders when delivering. I can't exactly turn to my server and say, l didn't order this.   To sum it up, I got the wrong order, and the quality isn't the same as the other times I've ordered from here",

Paid about $40 for 3 pho, spring rolls, and 3 waters. Will order from again next time I need pho delivered in Vegas! Nice delivery guy!",

I ordered their usual house vermicelli and when I arrived home, I first noticed that the egg rolls weren't cut (which is not a problem) I guess in this case they were disguising the fact that these were veggie rolls and not the original pork rolls that it typically comes with. The second thing I noticed was the pork, though it looked amazing I was very disappointed that I was basically served more fat than pork. Of course, I called to let them know of the error made and I soon realized it was a waste of time to call when the person on the phone either acted like he didn't know what I was talking about or just didn't care. I don't appreciate spending my hard earned money in a place that doesn't appreciate my business or is careful with their customer's orders. You would think they would want to leave a good impression to get you to come back. This will be the LAST time I ever give Da Lat my business.",

Their Thai green tea is nothing special and has a weird taste of something... way too sweet, but kind of expected out of a Thai tea. Saw a lot of take outs for UberEats and stuff, and I would definitely like this kind of food when I don't feel like leaving the house.",

The food is freshly made to order and has that je ne sais quoi home cooked mouth feeling. While I stayed a little longer than anticipated, the staff was so friendly I didn't seem to notice that the time had gone by. Initially I was just going to stop in and head back out but looked up 2 hours later after delving into a book between bites. It was 110 degrees today (good lord!) and the staff was on top of keeping my water refilled. I ordered the bun with sausage and egg rolls and it did not disappoint. It was perfect for such a hot day. Don't forget to check in for your 2 free eggrolls. I'll be back another hot day I'm sure to add a smoothie to the mix. This place is the dac biet yo.",

Next choice is the beef stew with egg noodle. Depending on the time of day there's usually a wait the plus is they are open until 2am . Service is usually quick , but it is a scratch restaurant so don't expect fast food restaurant times to get food . The 5 item rice dish is go to if you need quality and quantity it comes with grilled items shrimp, chicken, pork,egg rolls and Chinese sausage. Don't for register for the yelp cash back and activate for location. Also 2 free eggs rolls at check in on yelp.",

    "text": "Da Lat, brought back memories, I remembered dining here years ago, when they first opened, to be exact.. After a super long day, road tripping to Zion National Park, we were all hungry for PHO! Thanks to the Yelp app, I did my search and we all decided on Da Lat.   Da Lat, is a small restaurant located close to The Strip. Don't judge this place by its cover, its great & legit. One tip, Just use the bathroom before you arrive at restaurant, since the bathroom is located in their kitchen. (Nothing wrong with that) This restaurant sure filled up fast, when we got our food to when we left. It also started raining and pho was perfect for the rainy weather.   The great things about Da Lat, You can dine here on a  budget,  the prices are reasonable plus they even have monthly specials, happy hour, spring rolls with Yelp check in and Yelp cashback. Talk about savings!! We ordered the monthly special which was chicken pho, it's a full size bowl of chicken pho for under 5.00! We got our Yelp check in spring rolls and ordered 2 banh mi. The banh mi was huge and it was also cheap. We were all so stuffed with our pho and had leftovers of banh mi, which we took back to hotel to eat later.     The Pho was huge, broth was light, flavorful, hot, & noodles weren't overcooked, the banh mi which we got in chicken and pork, were delicious.  My family and I enjoyed the pho, banh mi & spring rolls.  They also have bubble drink specials but we were already full.   The service was wonderful, the only waiter/worker that night. He was very nice and was on top of it, working hard fulfilling everyone's order and request.   Overall, Enjoyed our meals and even received cashback in return. I will be back next time I'm in Sin City, back for pho fix at Da Lat!!",

Man, for such a quaint, cute, little place; it was big on service, cleanliness,and food.  The food was so yummy and very inexpensive.  This will be the only 2nd vietnamese restaurant that I will ever return when I am back to Vegas.  ^-^.",

They didn't give me the right amount of rice. Food was below average for Vietnamese food. The shredded pork didn't even have any pork in it. There was in person in the front. She took money to change for $100 in the kitchen and upon returning she served a customer while holding the changed money in the same hand. I work in the food industry and that is plain disgusting!! I felt bad for the guy who had his food delivered to him. I went up to pay ahead with cash and she didn't give me a receipt so I asked her to give me one and she spoke low saying she's couldn't give me one. I'm all like seriously u have a pack of receipts right in front of me. But she finally figure out to give me one. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Save your money, time, and tummy space go somewhere else.",

However, the grass jelly with coconut milk drink was pretty good .",

Pho had a good review from my boyfriend and the Bo Luc Lac (Rice with cube-shaped beef) was just average according to my sister. If you want a variety of vietnamese dishes and don't mind the small restaurant, give it a try! I found my portion of my order to be small, so don't be surprised. Also, the bathroom is located in the back which you get a preview of how they run their kitchen.",

Mind you, he had been craving rice dish since his last visit to San Jose. And yeah, he was so satisfied that he had to take a nap after eating here before we could get going...  I ordered Bun Bo Hue and the broth was good. Tasted a bit stronger than most places I've been too.  This is a 4 1/2 star. Would give this another 1/2 if the boy waiting on us could give us a few mins to look at the menu instead of asking what we want to order the second he sat us down.

The spring rolls were alright, but the peanut sauce was sickly looking and the fish sauce had nothing swimming in it. So sad...  The pho itself was decent. Nothing that stood out about it or not.

I live in OC so I know what is good and was is mediocre.  This place was sad.  It is a mom and pop place and the owners are not even Vietnamese.  They were Chinese who knows how to say a few Viet words.  The waiters try to mimic some of the food name but it was obvious that they did not understand any Vietnamese; why even try to pretend you know Viet?  The Pho had no flavoring and may satisfy the non-Viet but believe me when I say it taste nothing like Pho.  I should have went to the other True Viet places in town.  The 3-color desert was also sad...I couldn't even finish 1/4 of it.  Don't trust the reviews you get here on Yelp, try another place if I were you.  There is a reason they have Goupon deals here.",

The soup was big, delicious, and the guys working seemed nice and friendly. I'd happily come back in for a sit down meal at this late night joint, and I'll probably end up enjoying another bowl of bun bo hu in my hotel room before this trip is over!",

The only item that was available was the Banh Xeo. So we ordered the Banh Xeo and was told that it'll be 30mins wait. We stated we're fine with waiting. Towards the end of finishing our entrees, the Banh Xeo hasn't come out. Asked the waitress if we could have it to go. The waitress responded to us \"we never made your order. It's so busy so we decided not to make your order.\"  At this point, we didn't cared for it anymore but in the future, please let your customers know beforehand.",

    "text": "There's nothing so good on a cold winter night like some pho.  I've tried it at two other restaurants in Las Vegas and I find it very enjoyable.  There was only one other person eating in this small restaurant when I came in about 5:15 PM.  I was shown to a two top near the kitchen doors.  I was surprised how bright and modern the place was.  I expected it to be like some of the other places in the area, small mom and pop places that have a lot of wear and tear.  With the Yelp check in, you get two free egg rolls.  However, I wanted spring rolls so I let the free ones go to order the spring rolls.  I also ordered a combo pho which the menu describes as their pho bomb soup with beef meatballs, tripe, rare beef, well cooked beef and tendon.  The woman who served me soon brought a bottle of water and a cup.  I needed that later.  First up were the spring rolls.  They were good.  The peanut sauce didn't have a rich peanut flavor but it was OK.  Soon the soup came and it was very hot with steam rising from the large bowl.  Before putting any of the vegetables in it, I tasted the broth and it was nice and rich with beef flavor.  The rare beef was rare and there were a number of meatball pieces visible.  The broth also had some spice.  The pho also had some cilantro, white onion slices, and some scallion pieces.    I tore the spicy Thai basil in pieces and added it to the pho along with all the jalapeno slices, and half of the bean sprouts.  I added some of their house hot sauce to give the broth more kick.  Now I was ready for my eyes to water as I ate this good soup.  I finished the bowl by picking it up and dumping the last into my mouth.  I didn't want to leave any behind.  The meatball slices were very good, the tripe was tasty but few in pieces, and the rare beef was rare.  The tendon was--well tendon.  I had an expired Groupon and this through my server.  She ended up calling her boss and they told her, I'm assuming, to take it at its face value not the double value which is what's supposed to be done.  When the check came, it totaled $4 and some cents.  I paid and left knowing that I have to eat more pho during these cold months.  Da Lat is a solid place to go for pho and I'll be back to try some of their rice dishes.",

    "text": "(TL;DR - After hours eating can be limited and sometimes disastrous. Luckily it doesn't have to be, with Vietnamese gems like this place that's open until 4am! Coming from a Vietnamese chick, the Vietnamese food (for late night) is good! Plus, they have a full boba, milk tea, smoothie, dessert drink menu! (The boba isn't good, but the drinks are promising!)  My boyfriend and I got here at 3:30am. There was a nice gentleman from Greece that came out from behind the kitchen and seated us - we wondered if this was a Greek owned and run Vietnamese restaurant? That would be a special experience! But then we saw that the chef was in fact Vietnamese and we learned that the owner is also Vietnamese and interestingly enough, he actually supplies a lot of the boba shops (not clear on which ones) on Spring Mountain with their boba supplies.    Our server had a very, very strong accent, but that didn't cause any real problems, we just needed to clarify a few times with him and it was all good. We checked in on yelp and received the free 2 egg-rolls - they came out freshly fried, very crispy and not oily which is great! It's full of meat filling, but more on the dry and bland side. I'm not hating though, it's free!   Here's what we ordered:  Spicy Lemongrass Chicken - Yum! The first bite reminded me of the comforting Vietnamese home cooking I grew up with, from my mom and my grandmother. I can really taste the refreshing and bright flavor of fresh lemongrass and a hint of coconut milk and that makes me so happy! Also, the coconut milk helps create the ideal consistency for the bold, sweet and savory sauce (it's not spicy in our opinion.) Luckily it was extra saucy (and bossy), they don't skimp on it at all.  Ardie Y. said it best, \"Mash the rice in there and soak it all up.\" - Words of a wise man! That's right, get it all-up-in-there! It's just the right sized portion to share between 2, plus it's under $9? That's a great value.   Minor annoyances:  - I had an issue with how dry the rice was. It seems like it was sitting in the rice cooker since the early morning, so the rice grains were dried out and hard.  - The chicken cuts were weird, it wasn't all tender white meat, there were pieces of chewy cartilage here and there and cut into awkward oblong shapes (yup it's edible), but just not what I personally prefer in my stir-fried chicken dishes. Hey, don't let that sway you, the flavor of the sauce totally makes up for it - it's delicious! Plus it seems like they made it with great uniform cuts of chicken on Ardie Y.'s and Shawn H.'s visit.   I was drawn to their gigantic chalk board of drinks! What really caught my eye from their expansive drink/boba/slushy/smoothie menu was the sea cream (!!!) iced black tea or green tea! We have that all over the place at boba shops in CA and it's my ultimate favorite, but this was the first time I've ever saw it offered here in Vegas! I couldn't contain my excitement to try it! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try it this evening. Our server explained kindly to us that he is still new and he hasn't been trained to make that drink yet, so it won't taste good. Lol. I'll be honest, I was disappointed at first, but I can't be too mad at him - he was honest and a very nice hard working fellow, so I can totally understand.  We decided on the sesame milk tea with honey boba. It's beautiful to look at, plus I loved how many crushed sesame seeds I saw floating around in the drink and the flavor was rich, very nutty. The seeds did cause the texture of the drink to be gritty and it would tickle my throat a few times if I drank it too fast, plus the little seeds got stuck all in my teeth the majority of the time, but hey, I didn't mind it! I wasn't trying to impress anyone anyways at 3:30am. My boyfriend and I enjoy weird and unique textures, plus it's something different, so it was right up our alley.   The milk tea was tasty as well. It didn't taste like powder and it had just the right amount of sweetness. I would strongly urge you to get a milk tea, or even a smoothie without any boba. The boba was sitting precooked (not sure for how long) in a container and the consistency wasn't desirable, they were a bit stale with firm boba and mushy boba.   They also have a nice little selection of traditional Vietnamese deserts!  - Che 3 mau (three color drink) $3.95 - Che thai (fruit with milk) $4.50 - Suong sau nuoc dua (grass jelly) $3.50 - Rau cau dua (coconut jelly) $3.50  I'm excited to come back to give them a try. 2 hungry adults left very stuffed for less than $15!",

There was plenty of seafood and just the right amount of noodles.  The broth was delicious, and the best part was I didn't to add so much to get flavor.  The broth was full of flavor!  I also did not leave feeling like I needed to be rolled out because I had to add so much crap to my soup!     His choice was the hong kong crispy noodles type.  Don't remember the name of the dish at Da Lat, but it was large and delicious!    Aside from soup my son got the bbq pork rice plate which was a good portioned meal.   My daughter a typical beef meatball pho with shrimp-  which she enjoyed.    When it gets cold again and we need our pho fix, we will definitely be coming here more often.  It's a small place with very minimal seating.  It says it's open late, but late I think is a little before 2 am... maybe even earlier.",

    "text": "I found out about this place through Groupon, and I'm glad I did! I love how they have a lot of unique items on their menu that not a lot of other Vietnamese places have - like fried quail, bo thai chanh (raw beef with lime sauce), nem cuon (pork meatball summer rolls), bun rieu (shrimp paste soup), and mien ga (clear chicken noodle soup). They include generous amounts of meat with their soups. The bun rieu even had real crab, not just the kind from the can. I could tell because there was a whole crab claw in the soup. The vegetables seem pretty fresh. Their portions are a good amount for the price. Everything I've tried from their menu tastes really good. I will definitely be back!",

I'd consider myself a pho connoisseur and I can say without a doubt, best pho in Vegas. Well best pho broth in Vegas. I always get the veggie pho. I'm far from a vegetarian I just don't like meat swimming  in my soup. I'm a big fan of their other items- favorites are their shrimp papaya salad (BEST I've ever had outside of Thailand), house friend rice with scrumptious Chinese sausage and shrimp, the shaking beef melts in your mouth, beef wrap shrimp are better than Christmas morning and their egg rolls. Oh Those egg rolls. If I were to find out the filling was in fact not pork, but old tires and rat feet, I would still gladly inhale them. Their vermicelli with pork, pork skin and shrimp is also delectable. I dump coconut Cream on top to make it a real party . Very cute inside after the recent remodel. The staff is very friendly and kind. They know me by my voice when I call to get to go which is great and embarrassing. I don't care.",

My lady wanted to get some Vietnamese food, weird especially after clubbing and so we head out to Da Lat, which happen to be open 24 hours. There was only one customer and so we seated and ordered as soon as we walked in. Shared a fat bowl of pho with my friend, had the free egg rolls (which was fried and had a decent amount of meat in it). The pho itself was pretty good for a 24 hour place, they must be boiling those bones for days. We then finished our food, had a good night sleep and was ready for EDC's Friday lineup.",

I am pretty forward thinking with my food choices but this was almost too authentic for me.  :)  We definitely wanted to get some spicy soup and we found what we wanted.  The boy got a crab soup and loved it, I ordered a spicy vermacilli beef soup.  I asked what was in the soup and the servers response was \"beef.\"  So I ordered it.  It was extremely flavorful and was spicy and delicious and we were happy.    But it was not just \"beef.\"  I suppose it was mostly beef of sorts...there was a whole beef knuckle bone and several blood cakes and then some pork pate.  It was delicious but the blood cakes were a little bit much for me.  Like I said, delicious, service was nice, if you aren't very adventurous, just get the pho with rare beef :)",

I had my fave bahn xeo and they had frog legs (pass),5 flavors of beef and bun pork leg - which I really wanted to try. Next time. Their Pho stock is my perfect balance of salt, anise, marrow. It was worth the 6 mile walk from Mandalay Bay. And, the family that owns it is very friendly. Next time when I'm staying by the strip, I'll cab it.",

I ordered the grilled chicken and my boyfriend ordered the spare ribs (thanks to the only waiter there). My chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly on a bed of Pho noodles with fresh veggies. My boyfriends ribs fell off the bones and were delish! I also got fresh coconut water, which was a whole coconut with a hole hammered through and a straw. It doesn't get much fresher than that!

The pho here is heavier on the fish sauce than most places. I've brought people here and they either love it or hate it. But they always have quality slices of meats and never overcook the noodles. They have an excellent pork chop + I'm in love with any of their vermicelli bowls. All of their meats/seafood are tasty so you really can't go wrong here.",

The rolls on the other hand are so AMAZING better than any other viet restaurant I've been to ( ESP the pork patty roll) my favorite soup from here is the crab udon \"banh canh cua\" OH and their Thai tea is SO GOOD I'm like addicted to their Thai tea it tastes like it was brewed instead of those boba shops that make it with powder. They do a buy 2 milk tea or Thai tea get 1 free. They do sell boba drinks and smoothies here too and the drinks are all made with fresh fruit . The inside is decorated very nicely and they do have a tv with good music. The workers are pretty asian but service is still excellent. Overall I love this place they close at 2 am I recommend must try !",

I asked for extra jalapenos as usual but didn't need them--the broth was plenty spicy and kicked my butt. Some greens and sliced scallions were floating in there, nice quality meat if a bit stingy. Only real complaint was, unusual for a pho place, not enough broth! But that's ok, I lived through it and will return next time I am in Vegas and need pho.",

We decided to try Da Lat cause of all the great reviews from yelp, all I can say is OMG!!! The beef Pho was amazing, the broth was super clear and tasty. We also ordered the grilled pork bani mi sandwich, it was like a foot long sandwich, it was amazing! If I knew it was a size of a foot long, I've would have only ordered one to share with my husband, but I was glad I did order two because I saved it for a snack later on that night. For the price of $5.95 it was worth it for the size and the amount of meat and veggies you get inside. Will be coming back here again before heading back home to Florida. Give them a try you won't be disappointed.",

The place is pretty small, but very clean and can accommodate large parties.   They had no tables when we got there so service was pretty good, we were given water immediately and our order was taken right when we were ready.   I checked in on Yelp which gave me 2 free rolls, but there were four of us total so they gave us 4 rolls instead of just 2, it was very nice of the server to do that.   None of us felt like eating Pho so 3 of us tried the broken rice (com tam) with suong, cha, and bi. The grilled meat was delicious, the flavors were great. However, the cha was terrible, it was very watery and loose, melts in your mouth but not in the good way, and tasted very bland. I love to eat cha when I eat com tam so I was very disappointed in the cha. Bi was average, nothing impressive. My mom tried the hu tieu and was not impressed either.   They did give me a bowl of Pho broth with my rice dish, the broth was pretty good so maybe their pho would be really good.   A very important tip: Don't drink too much when you are  here!!! Their bathroom is located in the back of the kitchen... you literally walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. So awkward!! I went to use the bathroom and literally walked passed the cook who was frying our egg rolls. Very strange walking into the kitchen while she was prepping and cooking to use the bathroom.   Honestly, don't think I will come back here. I have my favorite place to go for Pho and since their other items were not delicious either, highly doubt I will come back.",

There a huge sign that says \"the best hangover\" which they stand behind their claim considering they offer energy drinks and Gatorade for the remedy. I have yet to eat at a pho joint that carries Gatorade  there was Vietnamese music videos on the tv when I first got here, but they changed it to top 40 music video hits once I sat down. Nice touch!   Food: bomb! Large portions and the pho tasted cleaner than most in Vegas. You don't taste the heavy msg that you would taste in other spots. I checked in and got 2 free egg rolls.

    "text": "My fiance and I were roaming around while running some errands and decided to explore something new.  Of the choices between Korean and Vietnamese, the warden wanted Viet freshness, so that was the verdict.  I jumped on Yelp to check out Viet diners other than the normal spots.  I bumped into a place called Da Lat, liddat lol.  The place had good reviews and was worth a shot since we were close by.    Upon entry, the place was a small mom and pop joint, which I like, and was 4/5 full, a good sign I thought.  The menu offered a lot of the same in addition to some traditional dishes.    I went with the sate pho and pork skin summer rolls.  I had a craving for Brodards rolls from Westminster, Cali, but was not expecting this to even come close.  I was looking for Mi Quang, but did not find it on the menu.  Its pretty hard to locate this dish unless its homemade.  As the food arrived, which was pretty quick, I instantly regret my decision.  The sate I was thinking of was more of a garlic oily broth that was still soupy, however, I got something that was more stewy.  I was the only one to blame for this and won't factor it into my review.  Although the rolls were plain and tastless.  It would help if they added that one little fried strip of roll wrapping to add some texture, but no joy.  I heard others saying that the place wasn't all that while eating pho, but I would have to try it for myself to make that determination.  Otherwise, my lady got the Bun Thit Nuong, hard not to get this right.  She didn't say it was anything to get naked and go streaking over though.  l can only assume that the reviews are likely based on late night pho fixes.  At a drunken stooper, almost anything is good and will have an after taste of bourbon (or whatever you drink).  They didn't have my soda hot ga (club soda with condensed milk and a raw egg), which was factored in this review.  By the way, I added a pic of the banner that read, \"the best hangover...what the pho,\" I shit you not.  That earned them an additional star, otherwise it would be a two star experience.",

Pho with rare steak and beef ball - they ended up giving us brisket, not rare steak and beef ball was like a beef ball, cut up into small pieces. The broth was just okay, the noodles a bit too soft for me as my chop sticks were breaking them too easily, well done brisket is okay for me, but the BF least favorite thing so he just ate noodles and I ate some of the meat.   BBQ pork rice with casserole and shredded pork - they ended up giving me BBQ pork with eggrolls and shrimp instead. It was decent seasoning on the pork and eggrolls are good  Since we got the free eggrolls though it was redundant in a way.   The food took a long while to get to the table and then it was wrong. I was tired so I did not want to send it back. Service was okay. It was weird in ways like she kept trying to give the BF room temperature water because he ordered hot tea, but she gave me ice water. I kinda get her though process, but other than that odd attentive detail service wasn't attentive as we would like on top of the kitchen not paying attention at all to the order. We ordered with the name and the number and I point to menus by habit so that it is not written wrong so I don't think it was a issue of being heard wrong unless the server of course really is a ree and still didn't write it right.   Just a note that there is not a \"public restroom\". I guess maybe you can use their restroom inside the kitchen? Maybe?.... I didn't know places were allowed to be restaurants without bathrooms that are accessible to guests. I like to eat eggrolls with hands and wrap lettuce, I had to cut it up and it was hard to shred my basil with a fork because I couldn't wash my hands.   It's a irritating experience with average food. I will go back to my regular late night pho spot.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 16/100)",

    "text": "This is a really small Vietnamese restaurant run and operated by mostly the members of a Vietnamese family.  The dad works in the kitchen, the daughters work the front (waitress, busser, cashier).  Counting the number of seats available, the capacity is probably 34 at the most.  The menu is full of pictures to help you with ordering, if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  The price is pretty reasonable, not the cheapest and probably not the most expensive by off-Strip Vietnamese restaurant standards.Most items are under $10.  Their Chicken Wings (comes with 3) is pretty good. It has nice flavor and has crispy exterior.  It is served with some salt and pepper, which you are supposed to squeeze some lime juice to form a very traditional Vietnamese condiment.  I think the chicken is good on its own, but the salty citrus flavor gives it a new depth of flavor.  I also tried their combination pho on this visit.  The broth was good, on the mild flavor side, but not greasy (I like that!).  The tendons that was in my bowl was very soft, indication that it was simmered for hours to get that nice texture.  The herbs and bean sprouts served with the pho is also very very fresh. It is just a minor detail, but it is all of the little things done right that makes something as pedestrian as pho to be elevated to the next level.  Gotta love that.  And I was told by one of my friend that this little restaurant is considered the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas by other Vietnamese!  And after trying some of their food, I can see why.  I will definiately be back for the delicious food and friendly service.",

Lemon grass chicken marked as spicy on menu, but it's not spicy at all. The price of most main dishes is around $9. If you check in on Yelp, you get 2 free egg rolls. Our waiter seemed to have forgotten the freebies, so we ended up getting them to go after the bill was paid. If you expect to order some different flavor Boba milk tea, you may be disappointed because they only have a few basic ones listed on menu. I was going to order sesame Boba milk tea because of a picture posted on review, but was told they don't have sesame. Scratch that idea!  The service we received was minimum, very disappointed. If you just come for the food, this place is worth a 2nd visit.",

The people that have left reviews must of came here when they were either done partying, or coming here the morning after.  Pho always tastes good after a good night of partying, so the reviews are mostly for pho.   I didn't do pho since it was a hot day, and I like to get my pho from a particular restaurant anyway.  I did the grilled chicken vermicelli and got my 2 cute little egg rolls that came complimentary for checking in on Yelp.    When we walked in, most tables were occupied.  We couldn't sit down right away because the restaurant had lots of dirty dishes still on a lot of the tables.  There was only one server so I had to keep that in mind.  BUT even before we ordered, ate, and left, there was still dirty dishes on the table.    Food was alright.  Nothing that made me say wow.  There are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas, but I don't think this one will be in my rotation.  Only plus is that it stays open until 4am.  Still, it won't be in my rotation.  I got totally disgusted with the tables not being cleaned right away.",

As for their service, there wasn't really anything special with their service. My friend and I walked in awkwardly and no one was there to greet us so we just sat down and waited for someone to help us out with the menu and whatnot.    The Pho itself was pretty decent, it's not the highest quality of pho, but it gets the job done if you're really craving. The broth was pretty good; the only thing that lacked quality is their noodles and their beef. Aside from that, it's alright.  As for their boba, I ordered the golden milk tea and it was good. The boba was good but the quality of the milk tea seemed a bit too heavy. My friend ordered the passion fruit tea and his drink was mediocre but the passion fruit was really overwhelming. It started to get better after the ice melted and watered it down a bit.   It's a pretty decent place to eat if you're craving pho.",

Their pho isn't even all that great yet they somehow draw hordes of people every time we've stopped by.   We whipped out trusty Yelp and stumbled upon Da Lat. We were a bit apprehensive because of the size of the place. We were hoping we'd avoid the wait since we were catching dinner a little later at night. Luckily, there was only one other party there and we were immediately seated at a table. The place is very small and intimate. There could be another party sitting at the furthest point of the restaurant but you could still probably hear everything they're saying.   You can make your own pho combination for $6.50 a pop (regular bowl). This actually got me pretty excited only because they offer tendon and tripe as opposed to Pho Kim Long. I decided on getting the meatballs, tendon and tripe. The wait was kind of long but that's because I'm super spoiled by all the pho places in OC/LA. The trimmings were dismal. I got 1.5 pieces of meatballs, 2 pieces of tendon and some tripe. You get a lot of the noodles but I was really disappointed with the amount of \"meat\" you get.   Regardless, the service was great and the quality was decent. I'd choose this place over Pho Kim Long any time.",

    "text": "I walked in after 8 pm on a Saturday night with a $16 Groupon.  They were located in a strip mall on W Flamingo Rd near the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.  There were only 2 other parties dining and the rest of the tables were dirty with empty plates.  I sat down at a table for two against the wall.  The server apologized and wiped the table down.  She handed me a menu.  I ordered the Beef Short Ribs and the Vietnamese Egg Rolls.  The 4 fried Egg Rolls came out in less than 10 minutes.  There were about 5 large crisp lettuce leaves piled on the plate for garnish.  I ate them with the sauce as a salad.  When the server brought out my Beef Short Ribs, she couldn't get to my table due to the customers' chairs back to back and they couldn't scoot in.  The server had to reach over a customer's shoulder and hand me the plate.  I was blocked in both directions.  There were about 3-4 strips of thick tender Beef Short Ribs and a big scoop of rice.  The cucumber and tomato garnish were sparse.  I was given a sharp steak knife to cut my meat.  The meat was very good.  There were still dirty dishes on tables all around me.  Every time new customers would walk in, the server would move the dirty dishes to another table rather than get the cart and clear the dishes.  One party came in and walked out after not being seated at a clean table.  Customers were taking soup spoons off other tables because their suppy on their table was empty.  They were also putting their empty plates on other dirty tables because their plates were not being cleared.  I felt sorry for this young girl.  I know she was trying her hardest.  The computer was down and she had trouble verifying my Groupon.  She also had to ring up the bill by hand.  It took over an HOUR to get my bill.  Even when I finally got her attention for the bill, she continued to take new orders and not bring me my bill.  This was a very popular place.  They were not hurting for business.  Customers were all speaking their native tongue.  I'm not sure if every one was Vietnamese.  The food was quite good.  The service, or actually lack of service SUCKED!!!  I think the bathroom was through the double kitchen doors.  I saw some customers walk in the kitchen and then back to their table.  If I did return, I would order Take Out.",

I had the Bun Bo Hue which was really tasty. Only wish it was slightly spicier.  Friends all ordered the rare steak pho, and they all seemed to thoroughly enjoy it judging from their empty pho bowls by the end of the meal.   So for a post-apocalyptic-Vegas hangover cure, Da Lat certainly has a satisfying remedy.",

Most dishes come with a heap of lettuce, mint leaves, and various other foliage, which make a delicious addition to the already tasty main dishes. We'll be coming back soon for sure.",

In my opinion this IS friggin NOT the BEST pho in Vegas..Cmon now fellow Yelpers,  I look to you guys with blind faith to give me the inside scoop and head's up about the best places to try or worse places to avoid. This place falls somewhere in the middle ground.  First off the pho is Meh ok. definately not the \"Best pho I've had in Vegas!\" as some yelpers write and also the restaurant itself is pretty \"ghetto\" for lack of a better word.   Pretty small restaurant and the big question is \"Does this place even have a Restroom?\"   Uhh, what's up with that? I could not locate one at all! I had to wait till I got out of the place to find one..  the first in my books.  I did give this place 2 stars because it does have free wi-fi available to its customers. (Password = vietnamese) If you don't want to ask. And another star because it wasn't the WORSE pho i've tried in the area.  Mehhh..",

I was expecting to add a ton of hoisin sauce as I always do, but ended up finding that the soup didn't even need extra flavoring. The soup came with pieces of liver, some weird fish tofu meat (which I later found out to be congealed FISH BLOOD), a meatless oxtail, and two pieces of beef shank. Looking back, I should've ordered a pho. We only ended up eating the shank and noodles. Somewhere between finding this restaurant on Yelp and ordering our food, we missed the memo about the suspicious meat.  The spring rolls were very fresh and the peanut sauce is one of the best I ever had.  Total order came out to exactly $16 including tax and tip. We probably would come back to try out their pho next time.",

This place had good reviews compared w/ other Vegas pho places nearby and I was not going to try the supposed \"pho\" in some of the fancier Vegas strip places.   It was really crowded in this tiny restaurant and there were several tables not cleaned off yet. The poor cashier/waitress was overwhelmed and had to go back twice to ask for help out front. No biggie, I'm pretty chill. The girl was super friendly though and I was able to use my Yelp offer for two eggrolls. The eggrolls were hot and delicious. I got pho with rare beef (pho tai) as my main dish. It didn't take that long to come out and tasted pretty good. Seemed to be a lot of soup and not as much noodles as I would like though. The beef quality was pretty ok. The bean sprouts, mint, etc. were a bit sparse.   Compared to other places (I'm from SoCal so I have eaten at lots of pho places), for what I got and location/look of the restaurant, I'd say this place was priced about $1-2 too high for their dishes. The bowl of pho I got was super basic and was $7. However, they did have $1 off offer w/ a text so that was cool too. It was a basic place for very basic pho. I may or may not return in the future when I'm in town depending on what else I can find.",
