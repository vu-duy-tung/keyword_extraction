I took two friends here today, was told a 20 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I asked the girl at the desk who said \"there's just two people in front of you.\" I sat on a bench in front of this person for the next 20 minutes as they sat group after group. After seeing at least 5 groups get seated, I asked again, only to be met with confused looks and NO apology. I could see the panic as the front end staff tried to figure out what they could do, which should have been seat us immediately. That didn't happen so we left. I won't be going back to this place ever again.",

I probably ordered badly choosing a sandwich at what is undeniably a breakfast joint, I can't recall the name, but it was roast beef, red onion, tomato and lettuce on sourdough sliced bread with \"horseradish mayonaise\" - The sandwich was of undeniable high quality, but I was disappointed that I couldn't detect any distinctive horseradish taste in the mayo - it just tasted like standard Best Foods to me. I quite enjoyed the seasoned potatoes that accompanied my meal.  Wife had a skillet of some sort involving scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions, some hash browns and toasted English muffins. She enjoyed the lot, although wasn't so impressed with her hash browns - we both have very exacting standards when it comes to these.  Overall we were prettty happy with our meal there - I would definitely order differently next time. For a ten buck sandwich I received something too close to what I could easily slap together at home, but the menu is reasonably extensive and the place was doing a roaring trade late Sunday morning. We will be back for further exploration.",

There is a location super close to my parent's house at home, and the though of going here is comforting and exciting (wow that's not at all cheesy). I often go with one of my best friends Ame, which probably adds to why I love this place so much.   Everything here is delicious. My friend Ame has ordered the Garden Patch omelette and enjoyed it quite a bit. My cousin and brother have gotten the scrambles and the sandwiches over the years, and I never hear a complaint from them. I almost always get one of Breanne's Basics, which all come with home fries/hash browns and either toast or coffee cake.   Speaking of coffee cake - HOLY SMOKES IT IS AMAZING. It is cinnamony, fluffy, usually a generous serving, and is served warm. You MUST get it. Even though I usually get one of the Basics meals, this cake kinda makes it extra awesome. Even if you get a sandwich, order the coffee cake. DO IT!  Service is always wonderful, and the place is always clean. I've been here more times than I can count on my hands combined and have always had five star service.",

They are known for their coffee cake, which changes flavors often but never a bad choice. I also will note a fondness for their seasoned potatoes. It's small cubes of potatoes that are deep fried, then sprinkled with their seasoning mix. My best guess is that the mix includes salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Always crispy and hot. During the busy times, there can be a wait to get a seat. And boy, does this place get busy! I often visit around opening, early in the morning, to avoid the big crowds. The place itself has a very casual and laid-back appearance. Prices are very reasonable. Friendly and attentive staff. Service has never been a problem yet. They are open for breakfast & lunch but I'm a fan of 'breakfast anytime' so I can't vouch for their lunch items. I've only had breakfast items here and only once came during lunch hour(ordered an omelet). I've brought alot of friends from out of town here when needing some early morning eats fresh from the airport. Great place for breakfast, I will keep coming here long as things don't change!",

We had a party of 8, and when we arrived, we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait...they were packed, but we were seated within about 15 minutes or so.    The menu is big, but not overwhelming, and they had something for everyone.    I've been on a new nutrition plan the last 2 weeks, and wanted to continue trying to eat somewhat healthy, and I was pleased to know that they offer healthy options.  They give you an option for egg whites (I prefer the whole egg for my breakfast...get some of the good fat into my diet), and rather than seasoned potatoes or hash browns, they give you the option to have a fresh fruit plate with your breakfast.  I ordered The Greek Omlette, which had spinach, diced tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  It was really good, and not too big, like so many other places.    My fella had the cobb salad with no avocado, and oil and vinegar dressing.  He enjoyed it, however, a word of caution:  Don't order the Hot Bacon dressing.  It appears to be ranch dressing with bacon grease mixed in.  It wasn't served hot, and it was absolutely disgusting. (I took a small taste.)   The breakfast also came with coffee cake, which I, sadly, only had a small bite of...but it was really good too.  All in all, the food was solid.  Not anything mind-blowing, but it was a good choice.  Service was a little slow to start, as it took a little while for someone to come over for drink orders...and by the time they did, we knew what we wanted to eat, but realistically, it wasn't that bad of a wait...we got to visit a bit, and the place WAS packed.    I'd come back again for sure.",

My friend and I ordered two egg dishes, the Greek which had feta, tomatoes and spinach and she ordered the Denver which had spinach, cheese and bacon in it.  Both of them were absolutely amazing!  The Greek was very tasty and super flavorful.  I think the spinach could have been left off, but it was still good.  Both dishes come with your choice of hash browns, toast and coffee cake.  Get the coffee cake.  They have differently flavors every time you attend and its not like normal coffee cake found at Starbucks.  Its super fluffy and light and the flavors are super amazing.  The oreo coffee cake was great!  I would totally come there again the next time I come back to visit.",

Not being from the area and staying at place a little far from Vegas (good ol Henderson) led me to this spot. Immediate attention and greets as soon as I walked in through the door. For a Saturday morning this place wasn't all that busy and we were seated within a few seconds LITERALLY seconds of walking in. The staff were all really polite, friendly and seemed to genuinely care about our experience.  Now let's talk about the food. From their Chili and cheese omelette, pumpkin white chocolate coffee cake to their chimichangas! (I didn't actually order all this food, picked off my bfs plate ;)) It was all great! Delicious. I almost wanted to try another savory cake to go. (Watching the carbs) And on our way out a huge basket filled with complimentary chocolate mints! Definitely recommend if you're in the area or don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a breakfast in Vegas which isn't allll that far. :)",

It was loaded with sauce and the eggs were poached for the least amount of time possible resulting in a soup Benedict. I also tried the fruit salad side and cottage cheese... Which included huge piecese of fruit and sprinkled paprika on the cheese... There was even paprika on the eggs..   I haven't been back and probably won't return.",

Met a girlfriend for a nice Sunday morning chat with eggs.  Surprisingly, waited only 10 minutes!  She had the turkey sausage with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and chocolate chip coffee cake.  I didn't see much left when she was done....must have been delicious! Was $7.95 plus $3 for juice.  I had the chicken tenders with gravy, potatoes, eggs, and sourdough toast.  All the goodness you can possibly imagine on one plate. Mine was $12.95, plus $2 for coffee and tip = $18.  Kinda of pricey for breakfast, but I took half home.  The portion was ginormous!  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The coffee was good and refilled.  Once again, no lattes, cappucino or espresso.  MEMO to all breakfast places: Get a freakin espresso machine! Then, you can charge $$$ for that sweet nectar of life! The potatoed were cripsy, which is good, but otherwise not very flavorful.  However, the mixed nicely wth all the gravy and gooey egg yolk on my plate.  Service was friendly and speedy.  A very satisfying breakfast!  They've got it right over here!",

Our server was swift and friendly, drinks were never empty, and we were out the door for 3 big meals, less than $30.  I will definitely be back.   My only knock is on my tip.  We asked to sit outside and in a huge, open patio, we are sat right next to two young gentlemen attempting to have a deep, personal discussion.  This was ackward for all involved.  It is impossible to zone out a conversation that is going on 4 feet away.  It was quite funny in retrospective, but a little common sense from the hostess would have been appreciated!",

The decor is sort of country chic, with booths and tables.  You can sit outside, inside or at the bar.  On weekends, at peak times, there is often a wait to get a table, so plan accordingly!  To me, it's worth the wait.  The food is awesome.  My \"go to\" lunch is \"The Club\" sandwich, piled so high with meats, cheese, tomatoes, avocados and lettuce that it actually needs the long toothpick to hold it together.  And the avocados are actually ripe and tasty.  As a Californian, that's super important to me.  (There's not much worse than an unripe avocado!)  I usually eat half and take the rest home.  I've had both fruit as a side, as well as potato salad.  I loved the potato salad, which is homemade, using red potatoes.  I crave their blueberry pancakes.  They're pretty simple.  Blueberry pancakes.  Short stack is three large pancakes.  But they use fresh blueberries.  So it's perfect.  It goes great with their fresh-squeezed orange juice.  I've also had their Denver omelette.  Cooked perfectly, with a nice layer of cheese on top.  Seasoned potatoes are awesome.  If you opt for hash browns, they are crispy and perfectly cooked.  Service was attentive.  The waitress checked every few minutes to see if we needed anything.  Bathrooms are very clean.  All in all, I love this place.  It's not fancy.  But if you want a solid breakfast/lunch spot with lots of options, this is a good one.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious. The soup came in a bigger bowl than I thought. The soup was perfect. Everything was yummy here. Price is affordable as well. The decorations inside was cute and I loved everything about this place. Definitely recommend and will come back.",

    "text": "The Cracked Egg is a great spot for breakfast if you're looking for that local, homey feel. I went on a weekday and the restaurant was full. There was about a 5-10 minute wait. which was tolerable. It went by very quick though especially since I spent my time looking over their extensive egg menu.  So extensive that I still needed time to look over the menu even after I was seated, but then again I'm really slow when it comes to ordering food so that could have been the reason why.   I ended up with an egg white \"Garden Patch\" omelet. It was fully loaded with spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. It was so huge that I couldn't even finish it, but it was delicious!! Also, my dish came with hash browns (or seasoned potatoes if you want) and coffee cake (or toast).   It was a great breakfast and a great way to kick off the morning! I recommend checking this place out!",

Right? Their menus are unique looking (like a newspaper)! It can be pretty loud and crowded. I wouldn't say this is one of my top favorite breakfast place, but it's an overall good breakfast place!

I always hear  such good things about this place, now I know why. The service was amazing and found out she has been working there a long time.

Got our drinks right away by a really nice guy. Ordered our food from the waitress shortly after that. It wasn't very crowded and she came back to the table to double check about something we had ordered.  The food was ok, it was as ordered but some of their stuff is very bland. Burnt toast.

After taking the first bite of warm homemade apple coffee cake, he looks up and with a giant grin says, \"This bite made me smile. I feel warm inside!\"   The food here is the epitome of comfort food. My first day, I ordered the Carnitas omelette with a slice of their homemade chocolate chip coffee cake (they have a different flavor of coffee cake every day). The carnitas were so tender and the eggs were cooked to perfection! I held the peppers and onions, but added avocado.   Today I ordered the bacon cheeseburger skillet with hash browns instead of the country potatoes and a slice of homemade apple coffee cake (told ya they change the flavor every day;). It was amazing! In addition, every time I see skillets, there's usually a pool of oil at the end of meal. Not here my friends! Just pure deliciousness! This is a must stop spot for the Vegas vacation!",

Your average diner atmosphere, choose among their filling and stuffed omelettes, salads, sandwiches and other breakfast options. (Tip: the pesto omelette is a pretty tasty and healthy post-breakfast dish that tastes less like brunch and is even more perfect for lunch.)   Did I mention their salads are huge? Yes, huge. So huge, in fact, that you may not want to finish it in one sitting unless you plan on unbuttoning somewhere or another.   As far as pricing goes, you'll dine on an affordable diner budget. Pay at the counter when you're through, and be thankful you could escape and pretend you're having a Sunday morning brunch instead of a weekday back-to-the-office lunch. Hey, it's what I did.",

I ended up choosing \"Joe's Scramble\" and substituting bacon instead of the ground beef. It was FANTASTIC! The scramble was a \"egg\"celent, cheesy, bacony and spinach monster! So delicious!  He choose the \"Biscuits and Gravy\" and he couldn't stop raving. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was tasty. He was able to substitute bacon instead of the hash browns and the bacon was cooked to perfection!   Two meals and full bellies for under $30!!! I wish there were more places like this!  Our only con was the booth. The cushion was lacking so don't plop down in them like we did and hurt yourself.",

    "text": "On the journey across America, our first stop was Sin City. My cousin recommended me this breakfast spot called, The Cracked Egg, which was only a few minutes away from the strip. The Cracked Egg on Rainbow Boulevard was located in a strip mall which was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. I guess that's what happens when it was over a hundred degrees out. This restaraunt closes at 3:00 P.M, which gave me the impression that their menu must be way above average to be able to serve only breakfast and have multiple locations.  Me and my friend reached the restaurant first so we grabbed a table for us and our three friends that were going to meet us there. Our waitress was very kind and told us it was no problem to wait in our booth while we wait for our friends. She even brought out five waters for us while she waited for our group to get together. The menu had a large variety of breakfast foods. They had the typical breakfast foods of eggs, sausages, omelettes, skillets, burgers, and other things.  I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash, which was made of bell peppers, onions, and eggs. I chose to have hash browns and coffee cake on the side instead of seasoned potatoes and toast. The coffee cake arrived first and I was delighted to see that it was hot, instead of the usual cold pastries many breakfast places serve. Shortly after I finished my coffee cake, the table's main dishes came out. The Homemade Corned Beef Hash came out in a glass skillet styled dish.           It didn't resemble the typical corned beef hash found in cans, but it looked more like ham, bell peppers, and onions put underneath two scrambled eggs. My hash browns were served on a separate plate.  I was very impressed with the quality of ingredients used to make such a simple meal. The eggs were fresh, and the cooking of the hash browns were perfect. None of the potatoes were burnt, unlike many other breakfast style restaurants. The Cracked Egg is probably one of the best breakfast spots I have been to. Their quality of food and service is probably why they can afford to open their restaurants until only 3:00 P.M! I will definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas for my breakfast fix!",

I am a frequent diner and I do have my favorite items, but I tend to visit when I, or someone in my party has a coupon because of the prices. There are several businesses close-by and they don't offer any type of corporate discounts, which is surprising.  I think if they added this \"perk' their business would get crazy busy.  Overall, I have no complaints about the food or service, and I recently brought my family from out of town in to enjoy an outstanding breakfast here.",

It turn out that they change daily. The coffee cake I got it didn't look like one. It look like angle cake with cheery inside then drissle with sugar on top. I end up just look at it and observed the cake not eat it. Then I request for wheat toast instead.  So if you are a coffee cake lover like me, you can tell what one good coffee cake look like :) as far food, I had the joe's scramble. It's has ground beef with spinach and potatos. Delish! Very filling. Totally happy with it. Definitely will come back to visit the restaurant next time I'm in Vegas.",

We were not disappointed!  The menu is extensive...and most dishes are priced an average of $11.  We are skillet crazed and the Egg delivered! I had the \"Bacon-Cheeseburger Skillet\" and my wife had a build your own skillet with sausage, tomato's, onions and cheese.  Cheeseburger for breakfast you say?  It was just chock full of ground beef, plenty of cheese, home style potatoes and fresh bacon galore.  I added a side of hollandaise to top my perfectly cooked eggs over easy and voila...taste perfection.  No skimping here.  The place was typical strip mall diner style seating...the staff friendly and helpful...all in all a great place to catch a great hearty breakfast!    Hungry for lunch...check the backside of the menu for sandwiches, burgers etc.  But the breakfast is the draw..I mean...it is called \"The Cracked Egg\" afterall.",

Anyway, we went on a Sunday and the wait was long of course but it was worth it. Love the booth seating and the service overall was perfect, especially on such a busy morning.

    "text": "Items selected:  Coffee Peach Coffee Cake Monte Cristo - Turkey, Ham, Swiss Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast - Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Filling, Honey, Bananas Croissant French Toast - Seasonal Berries, Banana, Powdered Sugar  With my mother in town for two more days another weekend of eating and unpacking began at local favorite \"The Cracked Egg\" and although I have to say the kitsch decor and happy holiday tunes contrasted severely with weary and disinterested service the food itself was quite good.  Clearly known for their daily interpretations of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious.",

I liked the coffee cake , however it needs a bit more density to be enjoyed. But I did enjoy it enough to give 4 stars. I ate the plain cheese omelet with seasoned potatoes. My companion had a thing with cream cheese combined with the eggs , i could say exactly but I forgot and if I had the menu in front of me I could tell you. Great place , great coffee , great service , I hope to be back soon.",

First and foremost, the 3 things that bring me back are the the coffee cake, the service and the food.  The Coffee Cake is perfection..  I've had at least 4 different kinds and they're all great (although the mocha/chocolate flavor is my favorite).  Lemon and the berry flavors are great as well.  The service here is wonderful as well.  Everyone working here is very friendly, fast and very helpful.  The skillets are really good.  I get the veggi skillet and add bacon.  The Pesto Scramble is also a family favorite (egg whites only).  Half-portions on the breakfasts are available too, so I would suggest a half-size or sharing for the lighter eaters.    A definite favorite of mine so don't miss it!",

The gluten free pancakes and other available options here allow me to order my favorite meals and enjoy a quality breakfast meal. The gluten free pancakes here are DELICIOUS and taste like the real deal. The omelet was very good and they even accommodate gluten free toast, which also, verrry good! Solid selection on the menu.  4STARS the only thing preventing this from being 5stars for me is the extra charge for gluten free is a little steep. Sucks to pay extra for having allergies, but I really appreciate the availability and the service we had was really excellent. Waitress was very sweet, helpful, and courteous. Experience was flawless, pricing was a little high.",

Server was friendly and prompt! We ordered the (special of the day) Confetti Pancakes (rainbow sprinkles, white chocolate chips & side of cream cheese icing); Veggie Benny (sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, smothered in hollandaise sauce); and Tropical French Toast (toasted coconut, macadamia nuts, topped with sliced bananas). Everything was so good! My daughter liked her confetti pancakes and ate it without the syrup or cream cheese frosting as it was already sweet from the sprinkles and white chocolate chips. Wish there was a Cracked Egg chain in Los Angeles...we'll just have to visit Vegas more often. :) Prices were decent and was expected for what you got. Everyone was a happy camper!",

The country fried steak was okay though we weren't a big fan of the gravy. The gravy was a little bland. The country potatoes were also lacking a little flavor in my opinion. The kickin' potatoes were good though perhaps because they were covered in crispy bacon and cheese. Can't go wrong with bacon and cheese.   I did enjoy the Mexican skillet and the scrambled eggs were cooked just right. Probably would've been great with flour tortillas but the rye toast was a sufficient side. Overall not bad. Next time I'll have to try their eggs Benedict.",

I chose the enchilada omelette to share and the other was the GVP. Both were excellent. You have of choice of seasoned potatoes or hash browns, in addition to toast or coffee cake. We ordered sourdough toast and coffee cake giving us the best of both worlds. I will definitely be back each and every time I am in Las Vegas.",

The staff is very friendly and attentive, they have a huge selection of delicious good quality food and their prices are good. I ordered the cakes and egg combo it comes with pancakes, 2 eggs any style I got scrambled with cheese and also your choice of bacon or sausage I got sausage. Now I know it sounds basic but it was probably the best pancakes and sausage I have ever had from a restaurant the pancakes were fluffy goodness and the sauce was nice and juicy I ate every bite of my plate which is rare for me.   My bf got the chicken fried steak which he devoured in a blink of an eye luckily i grabbed a bite before he finished it off and that too was also delicious ill be getting that next time we go here.   This place is a winner for sure!",

    "text": "First off, let me just say I LOVE a place that still puts a Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu, even if I did make a New Year's resolution about fried foods.  I like old school friendly coffee shops and this has that charm.  Sadly, that's where it ended for us.  My Monte Cristo (did you think I wouldn't order it?), while tasty inside, was overdone and dark brown, not golden, just this side of burnt. It wasn't very big, nor loaded with meat, which is weird for a Monte Cristo since the whole idea of a triple layer ham, swiss and turkey sandwich dipped in french toast batter, fried and coated in powdered sugar is to be colossal and leave you stuffed.  The bread was standard grocery store loaf size.  It was offered with potatoes or hash browns, but I ordered fruit, which was melon and not very good.  End of story for me.  Hub had the House Original sandwich; roast beef and cream cheese with red onion , tomato and lettuce.  He asked for no tomato, and also sadly ordered fruit.  The sandwich was a shocker, with no more than a 1/4 lb of meat and cream cheese spread thin.  It also had tomato on it...oops. The beef was not freshly sliced.  The bread was again nothing special, average size and not extremely fresh.  For a signature sandwich, it was a big disappointment to my better half.  We were both still hungry when we left.  The service was very nice, quick, and pleasant, though I don't particularly like being called 'dear' by someone maybe 10 to 15 years younger than me.  I'm not a blue hair!",

An individual in my party is also Gluten free so we GOOGLED for Gluten free options for brunch.  The Cracked Egg came up and their menu looked amazing and they did have Gluten free options.  We did see some of their reviews and decided it was worth a try.  We were staying at Luxor, the taxi ride was about $20 but, it was worth it.  We went on Sunday morning about 10:30 and the wait was minimal.  They have an extensive menu, I wanted to have a club sandwich or their grilled cheese but, had to try an omelette.  I was not disappointed, it was delicious.  Also, they have an option of toast or coffee cake with a meal and, do yourself a favor, get the coffee cake. It was warm, it had raspberry filling, it is homeade, I wish I ordered one to take home.  The service was fast and friendly.  Stay away from the buffets and give this place a try.    *If you are coming from the strip, make sure you take down the number for your taxi so they can come back and pick you up.  Our taxi driver was the best and gave us his mobile and picked us up within 15 minutes of calling him.  This place is NOT in walking distance from the strip.",

    "text": "Its was the Saturday before Mothers day and my Florist still needed an hour to finish my order so I walked across the parking lot to the Cracked Egg.  It was late morning/very early afternoon and the place was packed. The entrance isn't designed too well as today you had to wade through a crowd to get to the register and ask to be seated or put your name on a list. When its time to go you have to wade through that same crowd to pay and then again to exit.  I know bars/clubs put in focal points to force patrons to mingle with eachother or to create the appearance of the place seeming \"hot\"  I just didnt appreciate the experience this early and espically to get a couple over easy eggs.  Simply stated the store is just to small for a restaurant this popular.  The food wasn't bad but my Mexican/Jalapeno dish was lacking in flavor and that is impressive as you really have to work hard to kill the flavor of a Jalapeno.  The service was pleasant enough but once my food was delivered I didn't see my waitress a single time (she gave me my check with the food) and nobody else stopped by to check on my 3/4 empty soda so it was a good thing my jalapenos weren't spicy or flavourful.  I love this franchise but would recommend going on a non rush/less busy time so you can enjoy your food prepared with all the spices and ingredients they deserve and not be ignored.  Parking was a little tight as well. The store is located in a business plaza and not designed for easy in and out or for large hungry crowds.",

You can hang out for a little bit, since it's a very large establishment.

    "text": "So the food was great and came out really fast. I got the skillet and was able to choose either coffe cake or toast. I got the coffee cake it was chocolate and so good. My friend got the peach coffee cake, she didn't like it as much as the chocolate.  There was 9 of us and it was pretty busy in there but our server Kiara was nice and got our food to us way faster than we expected, which was great cause we took a 6 am flight from Los Angeles and we were starving.  I would recommend this place. The food is extremely reasonably priced, all 9 of us ate for a little over a hundred bucks. You can't beat that, they also got us seated pretty fast for a party that size.  I will be back next time I'm in town.",

I have been too few times just never got around too reviewing it. One thing really like about The Cracked Egg location so close too the house plus if this one busy then go five min down the road too there free standing restaurant. (I never been). It kind of small place so depending when you go there chance wait. We all meet up on weekend and good thing went early because by 10am the place was insane and line out the door. Go early or late breakfast/lunch crowds not your thing.   The Coffee Cake the bomb. I went with chili cheese omelette. It was really good! It had right portion of chili and cheese. The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch. One thing after spoiling myself with Red Velvet Pancakes at BabyStack wish they had some too. It one type of pancakes they don;t have but have other yummy options comes too pancakes. Everything on the menu is solid had few things on the menu and loved it!  The service had always been great! Even when its super busy the service always been great, staff if very friendly, and great way too start the day with meal at The Cracked Egg. =))",

This place was recommended, so we decided to check this modern breakfast spot out. I only wish that this place was closer to the strip. I guess that's why it was so easy to find a table to fit our group of 6 right away.  Food: 1) Coffee Cake was fantastic! The coffee cake here deserves 5 Stars. It was freshly baked, soft, moist, and perfectly sweet. I would actually make a pit stop here just for this if I'm driving to and from Vegas <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#oZXMxk_GLSoepyhkWveiJQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  2) Country Benny - Biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs, and smothered in gravy. I liked the gravy because it was flavorful and had a good consistency (not too watery or too thick). The eggs were poached well and the seasoned potatoes were so good!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#V-3L8nJ43gnSCuKv08V0wQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  3) Sausage and Eggs were pretty standard thick links with eggs and seasoned potatoes. It was good, but nothing special. You could probably buy the same links at a market and make it yourself. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#fbjiuYm9Je2vHxb9QXLOaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  Service: The servers were very nice and checked on us regularly to see how we were doing. You actually have to go up to the front to pay, which I found to be pretty inconvenient.",

Coffee Cake: Fresh, Spongy Soft, a little sweet/cinnamony.. Delicious! Reminded me of the 'Heavenly' Banana Nut muffin at Egg and I..  Homemade Corned Beef Hash: Real corned beef, short slices mixed with diced onions and bell peppers.. Eggs on top (I opted for egg whites this time). I went with their hashbrowns, it came on a separate dish (decent size). The Corned Beef was good, better than the usual canned versions. Hash Browns were average.  Chicken Fried Steak, Gravy and Eggs: Nicely portioned, chicken and gravy was good, eggs scrambled, seasoned potatoes (identical to seasoned potatoes at Egg and I) came as little fried treats with heavy seasoning and the white toast just like at every other restaurant.  Service, Atmosphere, Value and Taste: Overall, just squeezed into the 4 star level, in my opinion (the coffee cake gave them the edge). I plan to try more of their offerings.. If you like Egg and I, then you should feel the same for this place.. Or if your a breakfast person, it should satisfy!",

I had two eggs over medium, dry wheat toast and hash browns with coffee and she had two scrambled eggs with sliced tomatoes and coffee cake.  The service is fast, sweet and never let your mugs go thirsty.  They serve the coffee cake hot which is an awesome touch.  Everything was good, nothing in the great category.  Mom and I both thought the coffee cake, while moist and soft  to the extreme, was a sugar overload for us and she rued the decision to order toast.  So all in all, 3 to 3.5 stars.    P.S.  If I were in the throes of a hangover this place is not quite greasy enough, which is a great thing since I wasn't drunk.  :)",

On our last visit, I decided to create my own skillet. Skillets come with seasoned potatoes, two eggs, and various different toppings... I went with ham, cheese and mushrooms. It was served with a side of toast. Some places seem to dress these sort of skillet dishes with grease, but not here. It was great, plenty of all of the ingredients but not too much of anything...   We were served quickly and our drinks were never empty. Overall, a good place for your morning meal.",

It was all just average. I was very surprised we didn't love it. I looked it up on yelp first. it had 4 stars out of 299 people. I get there and parked and was a little skeptical because it looked like a strip mall. But then i get to the door and see all the awards and all the pictures of all the people that votes them the best food. We get our food and it was just average. I wish i would have went to black bear diner, egg and I or omelet house. But i know now. The food just didn't have much flavor. Im usually kind of picky but my wife who usually doesn't care said the same thing.",

My scramble was supposed to be bacon and an over easy egg on top of potatos.  I could not find the bacon and the over easy egg was well done.  I told the waitress the egg was over cooked and she said that's how they do it to ensure safety which i understand.  I ask for some country gravy to help ease my pain and she ended up charging us $2 for a side of gravy.    My dad asked for a medium steak.  That steak was so thin that it couldn't be helped but to come out well done.  He was also no to pleased that they did not have hash browns.",

This Cracked Egg is better than other locations. The service is always great and quick!  For some reason I did not know that the owner was one of the original owners of Egg Works that branched off mutually and independently. Sorry to compare but the potatoes are just not as crack like as Egg Works. They are still very yummy though.   I normally just get the sausage, eggs and potatoes which sets me back $7.95. My hubby always gets one of the skillets which is always way too much food! Leftovers!  My only gripe is the lack of alcohol. There is none. I am a night-shifter so breakfast is like my dinner and I love me some mimosas..",

    "text": "Gluten-free and Las Vegas doesn't go well together.  When you do find a breakfast place that does cater to the gluten-free people in Vegas, you have to visit!  We wanted breakfast, but nothing on the strip is gluten-free friendly.  We searched online and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  A local breakfast spot that has three locations in Vegas that indeed caters to people eating gluten-free!  We were excited and drove to the south Vegas location.  After going the wrong way off the freeway, we turned around and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  It is in a nice little outdoor strip mall/  Easy to find once you get going the right way. Upon walking in, we were greeted by the hostess, told them we would like the gluten-free menu and that we wanted to eat outside on their patio.  If you get a chance and it isn't 100 degrees outside yet, take advantage of eating outside on the patio!  The gluten-free menu is two full pages!  Yes...you can order gluten-free pancakes and french toast here!!  After studying the menus, we decided upon an omelet and a scramble. Both were huge portioned and VERY, VERY delicious!  It's places like this that makes me love breakfast food!  The staff here is very friendly and helpful.  They always had a smile on their faces.  Oh...I can't forget...they have those chocolate mints up at the cash register.  The pricing is a few dollars more than I expected, but it's a breakfast spot and it's in Vegas.  While it may not be on the strip, \"The Cracked Egg\" is about only a 5-10 min. drive away.  It well worth the drive to have a breakfast that's delicious and gluten-free!",

I had never experienced someone treating me differently because of the language I spoke.  I was speaking to my son in spanish when the waitress came up and she rolled her eyes.  I asked her if she had a problem and she was like \"no, what are you going to order?\", I ignored it and ordered some food.  By the time it got there my son was getting antsy and all the staff ( the waitress, hostess, manager) were looking at us.  I asked the waitress to wrap up the food to go cause I hate listening to children cry when Im eating and Im sure other people do to, so I was going to leave.  The manager came up and asked if there was a problem and I said no that my son was just antsy, the waitress and hostess laughing in the background looking at us.  I then said to the manager how uncomfortable it was how everyone was treating us.  He followed by saying  'I don\"t believe they would do that, I wouldn't allow it.\"  I said \"I am not asking you if you believe me or not I am telling you what happened\".  Long story short, we left.  The food I ate in the car sucked, seriously not just cause I was upset.  I have ordered food to go from mimmy's for breakfast and it kicked ass this was just bland!  I would recommend Denny's over this place.",

I had the tuna melt it was OK. It was a little tart because there was a lot of relish in there. The Monte Cristo sandwich has got to be taken off the menu that was nasty! Kind of bummed about it cause I barely ate anything. Walked out with an empty stomach. I had the mushroom swiss burger and it was good, however, I noticed the patty was already cut in half. Who in the right mind cuts a burger patty in half and then serve it? I've always had the create your own skillet thingy. That was good BUT a little skimpy on some ingredients.

I imagined pretty big egg portions for the price.  Alas, it was not.  I had the Northshore scrambler, lots of filler stuff mixed in the egg and it tasted good but if only it were, say, a little bit bigger...maybe by another inch?.  With the Northshore you have a choice of hash browns for diced potatoes.  For some reason, my potatoes arrived cold.  Well, maybe that's overstated.  But, it wasn't hot like my eggs.  Perhaps it's cooked in bulk and left i an aluminum tray.  I also tried the Croissant French Toast with berries.  I'm expecting something way better than IHOP.  The bread was hard upon arrival and it was also cold.  About half the blueberries where sour and half the strawberries were as well. I'm thankful they give you lots of syrup to drown it out.  The highlight of the meal is the nice warm coffee cake that several reviewers state is awesome.  Yes, it is.  I wanted another slice.   The staff are prompt and courteous and checked on us frequently. I like that since it started to get busy as soon as we arrived and server attentiveness usually goes down as the number of customers increase.  We tend to bring a crowd soon after we  arrive, not cause we're famous or even know these people who follow us.  We just seem to be one of Murphy's Laws.  Whether we are at a drive thru at Jack In The Box or in line at the M casino buffett....geez.  Will I go back again? Yes, but it won't be my first choice on my mind.",

Best coffee at a restaurant I think I've ever had, and it's always served hot and tastes fresh. The food has never been disappointing. I tend to order the same two menu items frequently, but any time I try something new it's always good. The only remotely negative thing about this place is it's very popular so there does tend to be a wait time when we come in. However it's usually only 10 minutes tops and I think it's well worth the wait.  I will continue to come here every Sunday for as long as it's open.",

    "text": "Wow, this place is great.  I was looking for some place for my sisters, friends and I to meet up with a relative that was near our hotel.  The Cracked Egg showed up on my google search, and I'm so glad it did.  We got there shortly after 9 on a Saturday morning with 6 people.  It took about ~20 minutes to seat us, which was expected.  I had looked over the menu while waiting, so by the time we sat down I knew what I wanted.  In fact, as soon as I saw it on the menu I didn't even have to keep looking.  Peanut butter stuffed french toast drizzled with bananas and honey.  This was one of my most favorite breakfasts ever.  It was like heaven on a plate!  All of the food we got was really good.  2 of the people I was with got coffee cake with their breakfasts, and boy was I jealous!  The type of coffee cake varies by whatever pan happens to come out of the oven, and they ended up with peach.  It was moist and warm and so good.  Breakfasts ordered:  Eggs Benedict, Monte Cristo, bacon cheeseburger skillet, and at least one other thing that I don't remember because I didn't taste it.  Everything was good.  I'm glad I got to taste a little bit of eveything, because they were all delicious.  I still stand by my decision of the peanut butter french toast.  yummy!  I can't wait until next Sept. when I'll be out there again for a repeat trip!",

Food was great, server got us toast immediately, just took forever to get seated and they seemed so short staffed.  You have to pay at the front counter which is annoying when there's so many people waiting for a table and not enough space to get through.  Luckily, everyone was pretty nice and I was greeted immediately when I came in.  Would come again, but not sure if I'd come again on a Saturday morning.",

Went around 8am on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded at all, but I can imagine the lines forming as it gets later.   I got the build your own skillet with over medium eggs, bacon, mushrooms & spinach. It came with either toast or a coffee cake. The serving size was pretty big and I thought the skillet itself was delicious! The coffee cake also came out super warm! Mmmm yummy in my tummy.  My mom got the South Shore scrambled eggs with diced chicken, Swiss cheese & avocado with a side of hash browns and your choice of toast or coffee cake. This combo was perfect and avocado tasted SO good with everything else!!  This was a great experience & I'd definitely come back. Customer service was on point & our food came out within 10-15 mins tops tasting amazing!",

I took in the sights and found French toast on the menu so my mind was set, just had to figure out which version I wanted to try.  The Tropical French toast comes with toasted coconut, macadamia nuts and topped with sliced bananas. I think there was some powder sugar in there too but the food seem to disappear rather quickly! The seasoned fries my colleague enjoyed came with ranch to dip them in and also had he same problem... poof they were gone!  Will definitely come back and try over menu options.

They were very busy which was expected because it was a Sunday and we were told the wait was about 20 minutes or so. After waiting close to an hour our we noticed people that came in after us were getting seated already and we went up and asked how much longer and why others were being seated before us ? The hostess literally went ugh , we called your name at 12 o'clock and the funny thing is that it was literally 12 o'clock on the dot at that moment . When looking down we had noticed that about 6 other groups after us had already been seated. Not a huge deal other than the Hostess's horrible attitude and to top it off started arguing with us for no reason !   The good news was the other hostess stepped right in and took us to a table . We have been to the Cracked Egg on Green Valley at least 5 times or so and this was our first time to this location . We will go back .   Just a note is that some people create there own issues instead of just saying sorry and taking care of the customer. That's all people really want is to be helped and treated with Care !",

    "text": "I normally don't have high standards when it comes to breakfast places because I've had quite a few mishaps with them. For starters, they're always busy with long waits for so-so flavors. If I had to go through that again, I'd skip to the next breakfast joint.   Now the interesting part about The Cracked Egg is their presentation. It's traditional, welcoming and friendly to say the least. Many of the entrees there seems like something you can get at other competition yet I feel like they can execute it better. First, I had the pleasure to try their Joe's Scramble. This consisted of Three Eggs scrambled with Seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions and Jack & Cheddar Cheese. The moment I read ground beef, I was sold. Unlike other breakfast places, they make their eggs so it's not overcooked. That's my favorite part because I start to get pretty upset when scrambled eggs are poorly made.   You also have a choice to toast and coffee cake. Choose the coffee cake. You'll thank me later. The cake tasted almost like angel cake offering soft and fluffy bites to them. Delicious to say the least and this was probably the highlight of my stay. But it doesn't stop there; it's served warm with bits of peach because they know good food. Is it possible to have two servings of that??   The service was great as our server continued to ask how we were doing. The food was long either because after a few minutes of ordering, I was already downing the most amazing coffee cake I've had the pleasure in eating :P   Also, there's no wifi there which made me appreciate the ambiance a lot more! Written on a placard states, \"no wifi, pretend it's like the 1940s and socialize.\" Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not what it said. It you get the idea. Nonetheless, it was bittersweet.   Now the question is, would I come back? Heck yeah! No wait and good food? Who can beat that?",

I got the Turkey bacon and eggs and my hubby got the cakes and bacon. The Turkey bacon was awesome. Very thick slices and the regular bacon was the same. The eggs were a good over medium and the hashbrowns were wonderful. My husband raved about the pancakes. Unfortunately, by the time I was ready for a bite, they were gone. And the food came out in like 10 minutes. Portions were decent and the coffee cake was also enjoyed...by my husband. But, that's ok because we will be back.",

The manager/hostess said we could have the next one available after it was cleaned. We took that as we could go sit down at the 1 that was clean. She took exception to that and felt she had to  point it out twice to us instead of just being a good host. Lots of attitude.    We ordered an omelet and a scramble. The omelet was overcooked, not light and fluffy, and coated with a big slab of cheese. For the scramble, you had to hunt and peck to find the bacon but it was loaded with onions. The seasoned potatoes are just plain but where OK. The hash browns were soft and mushy. The toast  came out burnt and we had to ask for replacement. The coffee cake was more like a dessert cake.   The highlight of the meal was Erin our waitress. Very pleasant. Gave her suggestions even though she's vegan. And provided very good service.   Over all, not the best experience. Will not be back.",

The staff was super friendly and attentive and were just awesome! I am not a picky eater, but my friends are and the staff did an awesome job accommodating my friends and their weird tastes.  I ended up having the Denver Omelette. That was awesome. Everything was great and we plan to come back again if we are in the area.  5 stars out of 5. Diverse menu. Lots of options for even the pickiest eaters. Attentive and friendly staff. Not too expensive after everything said and done. Definitely coming back again!",

Carol is so sweet to greet us when we walk in and when we leave: not just a general \"hello/good morning\" but something genuine.  The FOOD - you MUST get the seasoned potatoes! I've personally tried a variety of omelettes and all the other types of breakfast dishes and I've yet to have anything I didn't like. Ethan likes the \"Jayden\" off the kids menu, but he subs our the ham for bacon and no cheese. The kitchen staff always gets it just right and never makes us feel badly for customizing an order (thank goodness, bc kids are difficult at times!) haha.  This place is always busy, so don't be surprised! They seat you pretty quickly, so don't worry!",

    "text": "Breakfast, breakfast, and more breakfast! If you want breakfast, and want it done well, go to The Cracked Egg!  THE FOOD: With my usual craving to devour everything on the menu, it's always a challenge to decide on what to order, especially at breakfast because it's my favorite meal of the day. I ended up ordering the Cakes & Eggs Combo so I could get a little bit of everything. The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the sausage patties were flavorful. DON'T get the sausage links, the waiters/waitresses even recommend against it, hahaha. The pancakes were really good too! The right amount of fluffiness drenched in an ocean of syrup (I did that myself, of course).   The Cracked Egg also serves coffee cake, and it's apparently somewhat popular. I had the opportunity to eat some of this coffee cake, and it was...chocolate...coffee cake? I really don't know how to explain it any better than that. It was okay, it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top. Other people have told me they have had other types of coffee cake, so I'm guessing The Cracked Egg likes to change things up. If you're curious, I would ask the staff.  The staff is another topic. I didn't think they were very friendly. The woman who seated us (my mom, my stepdad, and I) practically threw our menus and utensils on the table without saying a word, and returned to the front of the restaurant. Our waitress was also very quick in wanting to get us to leave when the restaurant wasn't even half full.  THE VERDICT: Overall, the food is fantastic. The staff, not so much. I'll go back for the food, especially since I love a place that does breakfast well.",

The benny was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes and spinach weren't super soggy like you might expect. It was also topped with a bunch of avocado which was a plus because I feel like when you go to breakfast restaurants and order anything with avocado they skimp the amount. It was topped with delicious hollandaise but they might have put a bit too much on mine but that is only a very minor complaint. They were offering freshly made mocha coffee cake and also an oreo flavor which looked like I had to have it but I skipped on it since I just had s good workout. It was a sad decision because it looked so damn good lol.",

I had such a positive experience that i went back several times on my own since the first visit and even had a meeting there.   After having been there several times now, I can say that I have had the same great experience every time. The management must have a great system in place to train the servers and cooks to provide a consistent high level of customer experience.   I just cannot say too many good things about this Cracked Egg.",

Please don't order this.  It is made with a generic white cake mix that is not even very good mixed in with some cinnamon mix and white frosting.  Actually, it is pretty gross to eat for breakfast.    You know there is a question of quality when all of the menu items are put in \"quotations\".  Enjoy the \"Fresh-squeezed\" OJ as long as you realize it may be fresh squeezed, but it is the worst quality and cheapest OJ they apparently could get their hands on.  We had a variety of breakfast items including french toast, pancakes and some special \"hash\" item that is supposed to be a specialty.  I wouldn't order any of it again.    On a positive note the service was excellent and someone in our party got a hamburger (for breakfast??) but at least I can say everyone at our table really enjoyed the french fries.  Again, at a minimum please DO NOT order the coffee cake, some of the worst breakfast sweets I have ever had anywhere.",

    "text": "My love affair with The Cracked Egg started at this location and migrated to the Cheyenne location when I bought a home in Summerlin.  I'm still partial to this location mainly because it is more spacious and has a really light, fun ambiance to it. Their food is always fresh and interesting and I've never had a bad meal here. I tried the Vaquero omelet which had green chilis, chorizo, salsa, and lots of cheese, sour cream, and salsa smothered on top. This was one heavy, flavorful dish but the eggs were still fluffy and made me want to nom nom nom all day. The sourdough toast was also really interesting and I'd definitely get that again, that's for sure! If you are looking for something lighter you need to try the banana walnut pancakes because they are heavenly.  If you are in search of a solid, inexpensive breakfast with a fun atmosphere and friendly waitstaff then eat at The Cracked Egg and thank me later.",

This place serves large portions of good food, and everything comes with coffee cake...how can that be bad? Here is what we ordered:  Turkey sausage and eggs- My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and were light and fluffy. The turkey sausage appeared to be housemade and there were 3 generous medallions. I substituted cottage cheese for the potatoes without a problem.  Joe's scramble-This is basically everything but the kitchen sink held together by some eggs. Wow this was huge and delicious! It came with a gigantic portion of hash browns.  Breakfast came with peanut butter, chocolate chip coffee cake. The cake was warm and fluffy and gooey and sinful. Oh and did I mention big? Yeah, the pieces of coffee cake were massive!  The service was fast and friendly! This is a cute little place and we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas.",

The eggs benedict was delicious, Canadian bacon, poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce YUM! Could have gone without the hash browns not their best day.

    "text": "Darn it. I just realized as I started to write my review that I had a choice of coffee cake, but the waitress simply asked me what kind of toast I wanted, which made me forget the coffee cake! The coffee cake denial almost forced me to take a two star deduction because I can make better toast than the whole wheat that was delivered to me instead of the cakey treat. However, I will be kind... for now.   I ordered a vegetarian skillet and had them hold the cheese. I recommend this if you want a little lighter breakfast. I added some ketchup and hot sauce to create a delicious offering. The ingredients seemed fresh, and there was no heavy breakfast grease. The skillet potatoes were not covered with any magic dusting of spices, but they were still tasty.   One added bonus is that with most of the breakfasts they offer  a choice of shredded hash browns or cubed potatoes. Have you ever been to Waffle House? Well, these hash browns are like those, except with about 1/3 of the grease, and I am pretty sure you can't get them diced, smothered, and covered.  On a Saturday morning around 9:30am there was no wait. Our waitress was nice and prompt. Our food was delivered in a timely manner.   I will be back for my coffee cake.",

There is a lot of fun pictures and decorations on the walls -  the coffee pix are my favorites. Their rewards program is really great - I get coupons with $$ off all the time which brings me back as well.",

The place has a \"mom and pop\" feel to it and is very welcoming.  I love a breakfast that tastes and feels like mom cooked it.  The Cracked Egg delivered that momma cooked feel perfectly.  I order the classic French toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon.  Pretty simple you might say, but this is where other breakfast places come up short.  Others might be able to wow you with exotic breakfast options(which The Cracked Egg also has), but they lose track of the easy stuff.  Not The Cracked Egg!  Eggs were perfect, bacon amazing, and the French toast to die for!  I'm pretty sure the girlfriend and sister loved their dishes too, but I was so wrapped up with enjoying mine I didn't pay attention to them. =)  I could go on for hours on why the food was so good, instead I will just say you gotta come have breakfast if you are in the area.  Plan on making The Cracked Egg a \"go-to\" for breakfast every time I come to visit my sister!",

While I did arrive with a large group one Sunday morning and the wait was nearly 35-45 minutes for us, they did their best to accommodate us in the same section near each other.  I went with the veggie skillet, might I add was very tasty (I was able to get choice of how my eggs were cooked, as well as toast to go with). It was delicious, and what I thought was a \"healthy alternative\" probably wasn't because of the excessive amount of cheese that was packed into it (not to say I don't love cheese, but next time I'll be sure to request to tone it down a little more).  This location was extremely busy the Sunday morning I went, and because of such the service did take longer than usual. While I won't hold the service against that because it was busy (and knowing how that gets from working in a restaurant industry), I'd definitely like to return here to see what else there is to try.",

You can read an egg-sistentilent novel, study for an egg-xam, or fight Dr. Eggman in Sonic the Hedgehog, or just eat breakfast with me while I make bad puns all morning.  The place is rather big and clean, so while lots of people come here there is often either little or no wait for a table or counter seat.  Wait staff was nice and attentive, almost taking my order right away when they saw I wasn't looking at my menu anymore.  Ordered coffee and a Southwest skillet.  Coffee wasn't really the best I have had, but the food was simply excellent.  That southwest skillet was absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend it to anyone craving a mexican style breakfast.  Salsa was a bit too mild though, but then again I have a perchance for liking to punish my digestive system with spicy food, so don't mind me :).    I would definitely come back here.  It is a little pricer than eating at ihop or denny's, but it's absolutely worth it.  PROS: Delicious, well-made eggs Large and clean Good wait staff.  CONS: Coffee isn't that great  THE VERDICT:  Will keep coming here.",

I really didn't care for the Corned Beef hash & my boyfriend's French toast was kind of sad, and too dark. We asked for the Manager,  Ashley was so nice she asked if she could get us anything else we'd like... we were unsure.  I decided I was craving French toast and I really can't eat it because I'm allergic to wheat.  So I ordered it for myself but really I was planning on eating two bites and making the bf have it since his first order was just bad.  The French toast was delicious the second time around, nice golden brown.  By that time the place has cleared out and I decided maybe I will get something I can eat since they passed my \"french toast test\". Let's be honest if a brunch place can't nail French toast I wouldn't of stuck around.  So I wasn't crazy about the Corned beef hash serving I had, I figured I'll come back and try it another day maybe without onion next time and decided on the \"garden omelet\" it has mushroom and spinach on it.  I ordered it from the Gluten Free menu, totally loved the fresh ingredients veggies and melted cheese.    **They're Gluten Free Menu is the biggest I've seen anywhere ELSE!**  We plan on going back and bringing more friends/family here because I prefer this place over the Egg & I.  I want to try the coffee next time too. I don't know what I was thinking a soft drink with Lunch.",

    "text": "Where do I even start? This place is home for me. The very first time I visited The Cracked Egg (their original location in the NW), I was in high school. Even with my vast change in taste (all around, but mostly food-wise) in the last decade, this is still my benchmark for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  One thing that is consistent is my love for their Coffee Cake. It's a slice of fluffy goodness. Not to mention keeping you on your toes with unprecedented flavors! I ALWAYS order it with my breakfast. I've tried about ten of their flavors, but my favorites remain the pumpkin (obviously offered during Autumn) and the peanut butter (totally unexpected and simply amazing!). My goal has been to try all the flavors, so I get pretty excited when it's something I haven't had before. It's also the very first thing I ask the server, \"What flavor is the coffee cake today?\"  What I normally order for breakfast is the polish sausage, two sunny side-up eggs, and seasoned potatoes. The polish sausage is scrumptious, the eggs and potatoes are always cooked perfectly, and I love putting some Tabasco on my egg yolks, then dipping the potatoes in. YUM. Also, definitely some of the best \"breakfast\" potatoes! If I want to be healthy, I order The Garden Patch omelette that has fresh vegetables, made with egg whites.   For lunch, I'll order The Stuffed Avocado salad. A large bed of fresh lettuce, red onion, and tomatoes, and half an avocado stuffed with their housemade tuna salad. Ask for their house ranch dressing on the side and throw some black pepper on the salad, delicious.  Service is good and quick. They're always busy, but the food is quick to serve and tables are turned quickly as well. I also really like their Rewards Program. Not sure how long they've offered it, but I only learned about it about 8-10 months ago. I figured since I visit so often and always bring out-of-town visitors here, might as well participate and it has certainly paid off! Every month I receive a coupon flyer and earn rewards for every meal, so I have visited The Cracked Egg at least once or twice a month since I joined. Also, even with coupons accompanying almost every meal, I earned enough rewards to receive a $10 certificate in January!  If I'm looking for a quick, no-fuss, delicious breakfast, this is where I go, every time. It's definitely a favorite!",

I really just wanted a quiet, peaceful gluten-free brunch before attending a family wedding. And we got just that.   It was perfect weather outside when we came. There was a nice breeze and just the loveliest kiss of warmth from the sun. Service from all staff was welcoming and friendly. To top it off, they had a separate gluten-free/celiac-friendly menu! I was immediately drawn to the gluten-free pancakes, toast, and muffins. I got myself a delicious corned beef hash with a warm chocolate muffin! I couldn't be happier with my morning, especially when prices were under $10.   I am glad to have a found a local breakfast joint that is not too far from the strip. Now I have a go-to gluten-free diner whenever in Vegas.",

Let's start with the service - I've never gone into The Cracked Egg and had a negative experience. The staff is always friendly and polite. Also, they're very attentive and your drink cup is seldom empty. Sometimes there is a bit if a wait to get seated, especially on weekends.   Now let's get into the grub - Their food is good. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it's pretty tasty. I ordered the Benedict Ole for $11.40. This breakfast includes two eggs benedict, but instead of ham, it comes with chicken and green chiles. I got to choose between shredded hashbrowns or seasoned potatoes; I chose the hashbrowns. As I said, the meal was pretty good, but the flavors were nothing that left me wanting more. The hashbrowns were also pretty standard.   Overall, The Cracked Egg is a solid breakfast joint, but if you want to give other places around town a chance, I think you can find better. Also, their prices aren't really competitive when compared to other eateries. For two egg benedicts with hashbrowns, I paid almost $12.00. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere.",

    "text": "This has to be my second brunch place, just behind Bea Bea's in Burbank. However, this would make it my favorite brunch place in Vegas!   I was on a gal pals weekender trip to Vegas and we choose The Cracked Egg to end our two days of gorging (which is what gal pals do: get fat together and chat about life and getting fat).   We lucked out as we were seated right away. The service was prompt and attentive. Our server took our drink order within a minute of us being seated and seemed to return with beverages almost instantly after.   The menu is just stocked but not too stocked (i.e. Jerry's Famous Deli). It seemed like everything was really well planned and that they only put real bangers on their list of offerings.   We asked for recommendations and were informed that all of the boxed items were considered the more popular and highly demanded items so we paid those extra attention, but our server also shared some of her favorites. A staffer with favorites that aren't boxed tells me the food's awesome either way so I was excited.   We all decided to pick an item and then eat our meal family style. What we selected were:  - Chocolate chip banana pancakes: I usually see banana pancakes OR chocolate chip pancakes so seeing both in one on a menu made it an automatic selection. They were everything I wanted and more. The dish came with three pancakes, all ozzing with melty chips and sweetened by bananas that were juuuust about caramelized, but still fresh tasting. They were so good I didn't need butter or syrup, but I still smeared butter, because I can't deny my inner fatty.   - Chicken tenders, gravy, and eggs How have I not had this before? The chicken tenders were great on their own, but with The Cracked Egg's gravy, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs, we were swooning. (only critique is that I prefer my hashbrowns a little browner)  - Corned beef hash Really good. I consider it a cleaner version than the usual greasy and chunky standard, but I enjoyed it.   - Veggie Benedict It seemed plain with just avocado and tomato but, man, was it tasty. The tomato was lightly cooked so it oozed flavor and was delicious combined with the avocado, hollandaise, and yolk from the poached egg.   - Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake You mean this was FREE? We got two pieces since two of our dishes (the corned beef and tenders) came with an option of biscuit or coffee cake. This was ABSOFRIKKINLUTELY a surprise. This took your usual coffee cake, grabbed it by throat, and kicked it in its genitalia.   Oh and the prices were really fair for brunch (cuz, yaknow, LA brunch like to act like it deserves dinner prices).   By the time we left, the place was swamped, but the staff was very visibly keeping everything moving so I don't think anyone waited too long.   This was the perfect spot to end our weekend and I hope I'm back in Vegas soon to hit up those tenders!",

I would come here for the coffee cake alone.   I'm a simple breakfast eater: I eat eggs over easy with toast, hash browns, turkey sausage, and a side of avocado. That's it.   My friend ordered the sweet potato skillet - not something I would usually order. But, I snuck a bite from her plate and OHMYGOODNESS: FLAVOR EXPLOSION. Sweet potatoes with onions and apples and muenster cheese and bacon and eggs? All of the things you'd never expect in a skillet, but when combined to make the perfect bite, produce the most epic of flavors.   I will return. As usual. For more coffee cake. And to order the sweet potato skillet.",

We get there and as I ask for a table on the patio for two and a dog the hostess immediately asks if he is a service dog and I responded yes because he is. When we got to the patio there is a sign that says no dogs, we always have his badge so it wasn't a big deal.

    "text": "We don't go out for breakfast often but when we do, it's a treat for us.   Once we walked in, I immediately noticed the booths (the walls were taller) which provided a good amount of privacy between diners- nice! This restaurant is really cute; it felt like an elevated coffee shop, it actually had an ambiance. I was really impressed by it. (The Omelet House is kitschy, Blueberry Hill is basic, Squeeze In has an alien as a mascot, the 50s Diner is no frills, Babystacks is cute, Norm's Diner has outside seating, Black Bear Diner is rustic-country. It's been a while since we visited Jamms- but looks like a re-visit is in the near future).   It is a rectangular shape, the kitchen is located at the back wall, opposite the front door- the host is at her post and there is seating along the booth wall. In addition to booth seating, there are tables and chairs in the middle of the restaurant. There is bar seating facing the kitchen. I think that the max capacity is 126 or 106.    I ordered the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes, to split with our son. It was delicious. There were chunky pieces of sausage in the gravy- not a usual sight in biscuits and gravy. Our son's a dipper, so we asked for more, on the side. The eggs were perfect, not overdone, not runny. I added sriracha, mmm (on the table, see my pic, that was the reason for that table top pic- there is a method to my madness). The biscuits were a good size. The seasoned potatoes were perfect, crisp but tender inside. I would order this dish again  but I might try other things on the menu next time (if something else on the menu catches my eye, guess, it also depends on my mood). The kids menu (activity) comes with colored pencils. Hubby got a breakfast burrito- but by now, if you've read my other reviews on breakfast places, you know that. His burrito was yummy, too, I had a few bites. It was a good size, too.  The service was very good. Marlene was our server- she was nice, and she did check in on us, many times during our meal. There were a good amount of other people in the restaurant, but it wasn't crowded. The host was nice too. I was snapping pics of random things inside and the other workers probably noticed, but I had my reasons- I wanted to share them on Yelp! This restaurant is very clean.   I'm glad that we came here for breakfast- all of our bellies were happy, and I am sure that we will be back again. (I should mention that there are tons of dining options in the Rainbow & 215 area.)",

Although, no recovery was done with the rewards card problem, it is fine. I hate leaving 1 star reviews as I know how much it may affect the business.   So here's my 5 STAR update! This place has always been good when it comes to food and service. I work nearby, so we order from here at least once of twice a week. I love how their menu has so many different options, and everything that I have tried has always been tasty! My favorites are the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Salad (without the buffalo sauce) and the Egg's benedict, never fails.   If you are craving for good, tasty, and filling breakfast, this is a great place to be! Keep in mind that they do get quite busy on Friday and Saturday mornings, so plan accordingly!",

So that will tell you how good it is. The food is delicious and hits the spot. The Eggs Benedict is tasty and I love the hollandaise. I also recommend Joes Scramble, Pesto Scramble, Enchilada Omelette, Cracked Croissant, Huevos Ranchero and Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. For a sweeter dish, the Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast and homemade coffee cake are heaven. Service is always attentive and quick. I almost always request Stacy, because she's the best and has worked there for over a decade.",

Husband and I have tried so many breakfast spots in Vegas that it's not even funny, and they have ranged from \"meh\" to \"OMG no.\" This is the first time we've really enjoyed the breakfast foods we ordered.  I am aware some of you will immediately reject this review because you think Vegas breakfasts taste just like breakfast anywhere else. I love you, but this review is not for you.  For those of who you KNOW that tasty breakfast isn't really Vegas' *thing*, come HERE. This place is good.  The pancakes, etc. were NOT tasteless. The fruit was actually ripe. The Hollandaise was delicious and generously given. The coffee was actually good!  Literally the only thing that might be annoying is the condescending signage. (They actually have the \"There is no Wi-Fi. Talk to each other. Pretend it's 1995.\" To which I say: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F92606477500%2Fdunebat-coldswarkids-edwardspoonhands&s=db481c36cc6a3f381425c9d3a7cff3091bb83432d99ae94dbf358cd1563a5f73\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mostlysignssomeportents....</a>  )  It is with a SPIRIT OF TRUE IRONY that I leave this review for them online, which is where we FOUND this place, and which would not have been possible in 1995.

Usually with the breakfast meal, you get a choice of a coffee cake or toast. Coffee cake flavor changes daily. It comes out piping hot each time. I've had apple cinnmon, blueberry, and the latest one was the pumpkin nut coffee cake. It's so moist and sweet in every bite. Delicious. I wish i knew how to bake a coffee cake like these ones.   My usual order is some kind of skillet. The latest one i ordered was the country fried steak skillet. It consists of potatoes (which are seasoned perfectly to the point you don't even need ketchup or condiments for it) and then it has cut up pieces of the chicken fried steak, gravy and eggs. The eggs you can have any way you want. I always like mine scrambled.  Portions are generous as well. Remember to always eat just half of your coffee cake to save room for your meal. I sometimes get so caught up in the delicious coffee cake, I'm full by the time by meal comes.   All in all, great place for breakfast or brunch.",

We ordered the homemade corned beef and the short stack chocolate chip pancakes (3 huge pancakes) for my kids to share.    The corned beef wasn't anything like I expected...the corned beef was thinly stripped with diced peppers, onions and hash brown potatoes mixed together. It also came with hash browns and their homemade coffee cake. Their portions are big so I shared with my husband.  All in all, it was good, service was good.   I would go back!",

Service was brisk, refills often and prices fair.  She also recommended the homemade (and served warm) coffee cake instead of toast - bonus round.

I'm taking 2 stars off because of the service we get when we arrive and when we leave. If the older woman up front was more friendly upon arrival and when leaving maybe I wouldn't feel the way I do. It's such a shame! Such a great establishment and yet tainted by something as simple as greeting and saying goodbye. I understand at times it gets hectic and busy, you may lose your temper but you shouldn't make your guests feel like a burden when they ask to sit outside. You obviously have a patio and people are clearly sitting outside. Being in the industry I understand how frustrating customers can get but it's our job to give a great experience to keep them coming back. We've been coming here for over a year now and are the lowest of low maintenance when it comes to eating here. We know what we want, get in and get out. Foods great, waiters are great it's the leaving experience and coming experience that gives me a bad taste in my mouth :/ although I appreciate the nice gentleman who came by our table and apologized for not being able to accommodate our requests, even though it wasn't his fault, thank you good sir!",

The man-child picked out this location after looking online.   Bright and clean - we only waited about 10 min for a table. Hostess friendly. Someone stopped by right away and took our drink orders. The server came by very soon after that to make sure our drinks had been ordered and since we were first-timer's gave us time to make our selections.   Food came quickly.  I can't remember exactly what I had - something in a skillet - potatoes and eggs. Yum. Coffeecake - good but very rich and more suited to a dessert. Man-child had no problem assisting me by eating 2/3rds of it.. He had an omelette and kept saying \"I don't usually eat omelettes but this is good!\"  He already sees a return visit in his future during our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I grew up in Jersey, the land of the diner, and I must say that The Cracked Egg brought me back to that townie down home diner I have come to live without since moving out of the Garden State. I recommend sitting at the counter, because you can get a great view of how the kitchen works and have great conversation with locals. We met a guy with an exotic car rental and I believe he thought we had moved to Vegas because this place is removed from the strip. It was awesome to hear his recommendations on what to order, his business, and what he loved about the area. We swapped Big Island stories and learned that we had seen one of his cars on the strip earlier in the week! I had a skillet with sweet potatoes, apple, bacon, munster cheese, and 2 eggs over easy. Everything was cooked just the way I liked it- I dare say \"like grandma used to make\" except  my grandma never made me eggs- but if she did I imagine this is how she would do it. The husband got the green scramble which was packed with veggies, he asked for sweet potatoes instead of hash browns (extra charge but well worth it in our book) and they came out great. The coffee refills were free but we had already drank our coffee (which is how we functioned enough to find this place) and I had tomato juice. I will send any and all of my friends off the strip to find The Cracked Egg. Everything looked spectacular leaving the counter (pancakes the size of plates!!!!!!) and from the look of it, The Cracked Egg is pretty popular! All in all, if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will be back!",

Flavorful moist tender meat. in between a hot soft bun. I also had the eggs Benedict. Nice presentation. The Hollandaise sauce was alright. It seems generic to me. It taste like it came  from  a jar. The fries and hash browns are a definite 5 star. Service was blazing fast and super friendly. I like this place :-)",

The coffee cake NEVER fails and is always delish, no matter what flavor! I highly suggest the Taylor's scramble, build your own skillets, and the oatmeal. It's not your average oatmeal. Comes with half and half, raisins, granola, fresh berries, brown sugar, etc. It is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten and the ingredients and so fresh. If you join their breakfast club, they send you coupons in the mail all the time too. There really isn't a bad thing to say about this place, except that if you get there between 9-10am, you are going to wait a while for a seat! My boyfriend and I visit at least twice a month!",

I ordered a \"build your own skillet\" with pastrami, bacon, mushrooms, bell peppers, spinach, & broccoli. It was AWESOME; filled flavor and was very appealing to the eyes. My wife ordered the two egg combo with a waffle and potatoes; instead of eggs. I thought her food look great; she said it tasted average.

As for the setting it was perfect for an early morning breakfast. Felt like a home cooked meal sort of place. I ordered eggs and sausage. It came with hash browns and toast, which was plenty of food to fill me up. The portions are fairly large in my opinion. On a side note, the hash browns were probably the best I've had in a long time. They were very flavorful with the perfect seasoning to complete the meal.  Overall the food was wonderful. It was fairly priced ans a good change to my typical Vegas cuisine. I recommend it to those looking for something new with the same foods, but with a great taste!",

The seasoned potatoes are nothing special, just heavily seasoned fried potatoes, basically french fries in a different shape.   The coffee cake was great.  Though I'm not sure I've ever had bad coffee cake.  When will sugary bread not taste good?  Downside is you have to have whatever kind of coffee cake they have for the day, but that can also be a good thing because it takes out having to rack your brain to decide.  Would love to try their other flavors.  The banana chocolate chip pancakes were excellent! They were made just right. And I had sugar free syrup.  I also used a 2 for 1 coupon. Without it, it's a tad pricey, but so is every other good breakfast place I suppose.",

Upon entry, I had to wait a few minutes before I was acknowledged. I asked for the patio because it was early and it wouldn't be so hot (this was about 8:20am).  The hostess was polite, sure, but nothing super friendly. Oh, EVEN BETTER!@ The waitress! Omg, she came with her notepad and asked for my order, the end. I thought she had a grudge against me or something. I got my check super fast so I also felt like she wanted me to leave asap. She asked if I needed a box when she gave me my check so I don't know if I looked like I was ready to leave or if she was mad that I got the patio and she had to walk out to check up on me or something.  The food was decent; the portions were big (for me). I got 3 sausage links (they also come in patties) and lots of hash browns and my 2 eggs. They also offer you the seasoned potatoes if you don't want the hash browns. You also get another side and I chose the coffee cake. It was bitter, but not that shabby.  I signed up for their loyalty card in case I ever needed it. Maybe I'll try another location to check up on service. This third lady (I got helped by 3 people total) looked like she was the owner or manager or someone of that level. She was much more friendly and she processed my loyalty card and gave me points for it without me asking for it since I had forgotten about handing the card over to my waitress.  Overall, I hope I get better service if I get the chance to eat here again.",

After spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.  Wife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used \"Pamela's\"-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading \"Gluten Sensitive\" and not \"Gluten Free\", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.  The gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the \"Cakes and Eggs Combo\" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and \"regular\" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity \"burger, fries, and shake\" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?  My pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy \"hash browns\", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.  This location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to \"reality\".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.  3.95 stars",

Will it be cinnamon swirl? Will it be red velvet? Are you getting the holiday joy of pumpkin chocolate chip?  However this past trip we had one of our favorite waitresses, Nancy and she continued to show us great service as she always does. We went and were both in the mood for lunch and again it's our breakfast spot, so we knew we were taking a risk. Now don't get me wrong - I still ordered coffee cake and it was mocha chocolate chip and it was amazing, of course. Then I ordered a BLT with the fries and FANTASTIC. My boyfriend got the Pastrami sandwich and is still talking about how it is the best pastrami sandwich he's ever had. Not what you would expect from The Cracked Egg, but I guess we've found our new brunch spot?!  See you soon Cracked Egg!",

We decided to come to The Cracked Egg. The location is off of the 215/rainbow, a few blocks down. It's located next to Boyd Gaming and a few other local restaurants. Parking can be difficult, especially at lunch time. There is only a few parking spots, so be prepared to wait to grab a parking spot if you come for lunch.  Inside the restaurant is clean and smells delicious! I was immediately seated and provided drinks upon arrival. My colleague had arrived 15 minutes after me.   I had ordered the chicken fried steak with sour dough toast and scrambled eggs. My colleague had ordered the chicken tenders and gravy, no potatoes, with scrambled eggs and sourdough toast.   The order was cooked promptly. We had received our food within 10-15 minutes upon order. The waitress was extremely friendly and had checked our table several times to make sure we were good with drinks.  The food was really good, except I wish I had more gravy on my chicken fried steak. My colleague thought his meal was delicious. Restaurant was price is fair, especially for the large portion size.We would come back here again.",

I have not once had something on the menu that was dissatisfying. Sometimes seating can take a little bit of time because this place can get busy at times, but they always do their best to get you seated right away. This particular location is larger than the Ann/95 location where I normally go and it is nice to have a little more room to stretch out. The wait staff was prompt and took care of everything we needed. The food was good, but not as good as the Ann/95 location. I ordered the 'Big Bad Wolf' omelette and the cheese on the edges (the extra that fell immediately to the bottom of the pan on the sides of the omelette while it was still cooking) was really crispy/brown and not gooey/yellow like melted cheddar cheese should be. The presentation was not great either. This is the only thing, however, that wasn't up to par. Overall, a truly delicious breakfast experience.",

    "text": "Hungry fam was in search for good breakfast place in our new area. I think we found it. Wasn't as busy, sat our family down of 5 on arrival. Our waitress \"Tracey\" was amazing and really nice. She took our orders by memory and repeated it back to us accurately. She recommended the peanut butter and jelly coffee cake which was the BOMB. It was moist and warm. I could go back for just coffee and coffee cake. My husband and I shared a country fried steak with gravy, didn't know we could do half Hash brown and half seasoned potatoes and that's what we did. Country fried steak was good, it wasn't as heavy. So I didn't feel bad eating it. The kids got the banana choc chip with eggs and bacon. Also the Monte cristo which was some sort of ham and cheese stuff French toast if im not mistaken.   Overall, the experience was great. Great food, great staff, food was quick, reasonable price (maybe a tad higher) but with all said and eats...we will be back!   Thank you Yelpers for the pick! Happy eats!!",

If you feel like indulging, try the Monte Cristo. Its a turkey, ham, and swiss sammy in french toast batter deep fried.  Dipped in syrup and you're in heaven!!  If you feel like a healthier option, go for the Veggie Benny.  Avocado, spinach, grilled tomatoes, two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise.  One of the best benedicts I've ever had!",

The carnitas that they served with them were delicious, and the green sauce (probably tomatillo) that topped them and the beans was delicious as well.  They also have old school shredded hash browns!  I was so excited about this, you rarely see them anymore, usually it's now breakfast potatoes, which I'm not a big fan of.  The hash browns were great, crispy on the outside and smooth/fluffy on the inside, delicious!  The service here was good too; I was doing a working breakfast and my waitress was nice enough to only stop by a couple of times outside of taking my order and delivering my food and then clearing.  Overall, I would say if you want a solid and tasty breakfast here would be a good place to go.",

Yes, the coffee cake is a must. The day we went, we had the pumpkin pecan coffee cake, and it was a great start to our meal. I got the Country Benny with Hash Browns. It was really good! I would definitely get this again with extra gravy!! My boyfriend got the California Omlete with Potatoes. It was also pretty good. My only complaint about this place was how much they charged for the side sauce. A side of salsa and a side of sour cream were both $1+ each. I think $.50 - $.75 is more reasonable. It's a ways from the strip, but a great place to eat before heading back home to California. We will definitely be back!",

A lot of the meals waver above and below $10, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Hearty portions with the taste to match.

I opted for an egg white omelet, seasoned potatoes and sourdough toast. Also I decided to throw in a coffee and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (no joke...it was fresh squeezed). It was delightful. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and yummy. Will be back there many times when I have to take the kids to school.",

No better then any Denny's or IHOP I've ever been too.  You have more room to eat, a quieter meal, and better service at IHOP.  Sorry, but it's the truth.

And again, Yelp did not fail us!  There were lots of reviews complaining about over-crowding and the place being uncomfortably jammed packed, but we didn't have that problem at all! Perhaps it was cause we came on a Tuesday morning? Anyways, wouldn't the fact that it's supposedly always crowded fact that it's a popular/awesome place to eat? I would think so!  Anyways, the food: GREAT. I ordered a Tropical French Toast while the bf got the Southwestern Scramble. Shredded coconut + macadamia pieces + bananas +french toast = freakin awesome! With the coconut and the macadamia, you really don't even need the syrup or butter! The Southwestern Scramble was delicious as well: Omelet with cheese and other yummy goodness, seasoned potatoes and sausages.  In the words of one of my friends, \"anything southwestern is good!\" And I totally agree! I also got some protien in the form of some turkey sausage patties, or was it chicken? I don't remember, but it was yummy too =]  All in all, I wish this place existed closer to home!",

It get's crowded on weekends, but I'm assuming that's because of how awesome it is. While I don't really stray to far from my \"north shore scramble\",what I have tasted otherwise has been great as well. Staff is friendly and parking is always pretty easy as well. I enjoy when it gets a little warmer and I can sit outside, but inside is always fine as well. Will definitely be back, again and again and again.",

Other stuff i've tried on previous visits include:  - croissant french toast: not my favorite, the french toast croissant was too mushy  - raspberry stuffed french toast: delicious  - chocolate chip pancakes: good, but nothing spectacular  - philly cheesesteak: surprisingly good, a little on the small side, chicken was very tender, plenty of onions and peppers, bread was nice and chewy and fresh  The service tends to be on the slow side no matter the day or time. The last time I went was a Monday morning and there were maybe 2 other groups in whole place. It still took a while to get my order in. Didn't see my waitress again until we flagged her down to get the check. But, you're not paying for the service or ambiance. Just good breakfast and lunch food.",

This has been the case several times, like four, so i give up and drive up to trop n jones for some awesome breakfast at the black bear.",

Prices were a little much.  6.75 for 2 eggs, toast, and a small coffee.  I ordered the French Toast and a chocolate milk.  The toast was soggy, even the crust.  The chocolate milk tasted like hershey's syrup mix but watered down.  I also tried a couple bites of the huevos rancheros which actually wasn't too bad.  flavors were very bold and quite yummy.  The only thing is that it lacked texture and just felt like mush in your mouth.  Service was good; timely and waitresses were friendly.  I'd probably check this place out again to try something else that would hopefully change my view of this place, but very sparingly considering the prices.",

They're always busy but we usually get sat within 15-20 minutes. People are in and out! I am always greeted with awesome service and the vibe is such a family and home-y atmosphere. I really enjoy getting the nutella stuffed smores french toast. TO. DIE. FOR. I've probably gotten it like 5 or 6 times already! They also have some of the best seasoned potatoes in town. One of my absolute favorites! I also really like their omelets. They're super hot and fresh and you can make them however you want or they have a few you can choose from. I like The Denver! I've also had their skillets, DELISH! I always have a hard time choosing what I want to get. I want to try their whole menu because everything looks so good! Eventually I will be able to get to that point, but for now I have stuck with what I know is truly my favorite. The french toast. Go ahead, try it! You won't be disappointed!",

They opened their first location on Cheyenne and Buffalo and they've expanded to deliver amazing morning and lunch eats since.  Everything on the menu is good, but we always go for their skillets/scrambles. Every breakfast place has these now-standard items, but the Cracked Egg is the restaurant that by all others should be measured. Perfectly cut and crisped home fries make a salty, crunch bed for your custom or templated additions. I'm a fan of the SouthShore scramble. Cheese, chicken, bacon, and avocado? Yes please!  Always order their coffee cake as your side - enjoy the surprise of finding out what flavor you'll get. It changes daily.",

It barely had the flavor of French toast, it was more like a croissant pressed down on the griddle with a little butter, with an added Petsmart flavor, lol. I don't know what it was. I finished off the berries, bananas, and my side of eggs. My son ordered a basic eggs, sausage, and pancakes.. which you can't go wrong with that! The pancakes were yummy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Traci, was vibrant and cheerful. My son loved her! She was awesome. I just wished my French toast tasted like French toast.",

It's a family run restaurant from what I've told and you will get one of the best services!! They constantly check up on you and really try to get you seated quick (because yes you will be waiting on the weekends around 10/11ish)!  I think I've gotten a variety of their dishes: scrambles, omelettes, and skillet. Of course I always get the coffee cake which either comes with original or a berry flavor.  The Coffee Cake is amazing. It seriously just melts in your mouth! It always comes out fresh and warm.  I also usually get seasoned potatoes over hash browns. Don't get me wrong. I love their hash browns, but I seriously love the seasoning and the cut size of the seasoned potatoes. So yes, definitely get this.  As for their scrambles, omelettes, and skillet.... the portions are HUGE. I can't even finish it and my fiance who eats a ton is full off one of their dishes. It's insane just how much they give you. It's so filling because it's all carbs. (: So you know you'll definitely get the bang for your buck. But all I can say is that everything on their menu is DELICIOUS. Comes out fresh and hot and packed with flavors.   I can't wait to go back to try more of their menu!! Getting so hungry thinking about it. Haha. They do have a lunch menu with sandwiches and stuff, but I think they serve breakfast all day.",

Some of the daily coffee cakes are delicious, and some are just okay, but I love that it's a different flavor every time I come in. The clam chowder isn't my favorite. Service at the counter is always fast, friendly, and accurate, even when it's busy.",

    "text": "This is no tourist joint as it's way off the strip. What's great about this place is it has a buy 1 get 1 free coupon up to 10 dollars in value from the Las vVgas coupon book. Coffee is 2 dollars and 15 cents a cup. I had Luisa's scramble...3 eggs with sausage, peppers, onions, fresh shrooms, and melted Muenster cheese on top. Came with home fries which were like Ore-Ida, which I didn't care for that much. Also comes with choice of toast or cofee cake.   The scramble was big and tasty...I would get it again, but would try the hash browns instead of the potatoes/home fries. A bit pricey without the coupon at 9 dollars and 95 cents. This place is clean and the service was fine.   Pretty funny sign in the bathroom... see my picture. Overall a pretty decent experience but definitely kind of pricey without for a basic diner kinda place. They open at 6 amI and  you can sit wherever you want. They have tables, booths and a bar top.",

Sweet. Lots of sweet fruits. This definitely caught my attention and was pretty unique.   Coffee bread: overhyped! But it's still good, but our least favorite dish of our selection.

I used to go here once a week on my way to class when I had more time and money but now I am reduced to going whenever I get a chance. But every time is great.  I love their scrambles and their build your own skillet options. But when I go with the skillet I end up picking too many ingredients and spending more money than I want. The scrambles they have are great especially the southside scramble.   The staff is usually really friendly and I get my food within 15 minutes of sitting down (if I know what I want when I sit down). Which is ideal for a quick breakfast when you do not have much time.",

It was very busy (11 a.m. on a Sunday so not surprising) and very noisy, we probably waited 20-25 minutes for a table.  It's pretty small inside too so there's lots of pushing past people and saying excuse me and all that.   In terms of breakfast/brunch places in Vegas, the Cracked Egg is better than Black Bear Diner but not as good as Hash House a Go Go.  Better than IHOP and much better than Pancake House.  Not as good as DW Bistro.  But both DW and Hash House are also more expensive.  We both had the Cakes & Eggs (with bacon) and it was good.  Nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and would go back again.  Reasonable price for about $12.  Service was adequate but again, nothing special.  She got us what we needed and that was about it.    One thing I didn't like - if you pay with a card and want to put the tip on the card, you have to tell the cashier how much you want to tip.  Makes me uncomfortable and I find it tacky.  Next time I'll bring some cash!",

A neighborhood favorite, there's definitely a wait if you want to score a table inside.  If you're willing to deal with the summer heat, there are plenty of tables outside and a mister that might help out a tad bit.  If your party is small enough, watch out for the counter because that's first come, first serve.  And you'll get first hand view of how this busy breakfast place keeps their food spitting out like fire!  The Big F was easily lured by the Chicken Fried Steak for $10.95.  It comes with two eggs, seasoned potatoes or hashed browns and a choice of toast or coffee cake.  A nice generous portion, he was definitely pleased with his order.  I went for the The Californian omelets for $9.95.  It comes with sliced bacon and jack cheese in the inside and sliced avocado on top.  It was definitely a generous portion, and I couldn't finish my order.  Looking around, the orders are HUGE here.  Salads are gigantic and definitely meant for sharing!  Sandwiches, burgers, and skillets are also on the menu.  I don't think many people really finish their brunch here because it's just that big!

The menu is plentiful and there are many choices for all types of eaters.  The prices are also fair and the wait service is also super friendly.  We went around 11am on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend and had no problem being seated right away (party of 3).  If I had one complaint it would be about the coffee cake that everyone else raved about.  I wish that they had a variety to choose from per day vs. having a special cake each day.  When we went they had the cherry cream coffee cake and it was just okay.  It had a nice flavor but it was a bit undercooked which gave it a sticky feeling against the tongue.  The food and atmosphere were good enough so we'll definitely head back the next time we are in LV.",

    "text": "Good customer service is as crucial as good food. Although the food was quite delicious, the bad service we experienced left a horrible taste in my mouth.  My husband and I went for Sunday brunch and the hostess told us the wait would be about 20 minutes. The wait area inside was full so we waited outside with about 15 other people. We figured with this many people waiting that this place had to be good. About 25 minutes later, my husband checked with the hostess and she said she called his name about 20 minutes ago. Funny thing was that while my husband was inside talking to the hostess, a party of 5 next to me complained that they were never called and the hostess insisted she called them. They were more bothered (as was I) that the hostess insisted she called their name and didn't apologize for the inconvenience. A group of 4 who just paid walked out and were complaining about the rudeness of the hostess! Three groups complaining about the bitchiness of the hostess is not a coincidence!  When we were finally seated, the hostess dropped our menu and our silverware on the table, didn't say a word and walked away. WOW. We waited a while for our waitress and she also had a sour attitude! I even asked my husband if I was just imagining things but agreed that she was not pleasant at all.  As I was making mental notes about what I should rant in my Yelp review, the coffee cake came out and managed to bring what was supposed to be a 2 star review to a 2.5/3. It was moist and heavenly!  My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was decent but not the best we've ever had. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I loved the hollandaise and the thickness of the ham. The seasoned potatoes were the perfect complement to the eggs.  Note to the management of The Cracked Egg: Bad attitude can really ruin a customer's service. On busy weekends, please ensure your hostesses and wait staff are smiling and friendly.  I would suggest to invest in pagers because it can be difficult to hear the hostesses when there are 15 people waiting outside and planes flying overhead. With Egg Works opening up down the street in Fall 2011, I doubt I'd come back here because of bad attitude I encountered even though the food was good.",

The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was thick but smooth with no congeling.  Service was good.  Clean environment.  A little pricey but worth it. I will be returning.  Thank you for a great meal.",

My boyfriend ordered the north shore scramble and I the Denver omelette (add avocado) half of the avocado was a brownish grey color which I ignored and pushed it to the side. About 5 minutes later after we've started eating, my boyfriend finds what looks like facial hair in his scrambled eggs. When we bring it up to the waitress she begins to argue with us on how she saw nothing. So my boyfriend picks it up with his fork and she says that it was just the cheese in the egg. I'm just curious.. since when are eggs and cheese black curly?",

Food was ready quickly n came out hot, waitress was ontop of coffee & drinks. All in all def a good Place to come to for breakfast/Lunch.",

Because everyone kept mentioning the coffee cake, I made sure to order something that came with that option.  I decided on the veggie skillet with over easy eggs. The first thing that came out was the coffee cake and I have to say, I am not a fan. The flavor was OK. I just didn't like the texture. Fortunately, the veggie skillet was good. It felt healthy and not at all greasy.  Overall, this place is A-OK. They didn't leave enough of an impression on me, but I'd come back if that's what the group wants.",

We are regulars and she obviously didn't know that but she was very rude to us. Especially to my wife. So unprofessional, her attitude sucked. This was on 6/9/17. We would go every Fridays but today 6/16/17 we didn't go. We called to talk to manager that day. We don't like complaining but they need to know what kine of people they hire. Hopefully she changes her attitude. For now they lost our business. We were just treated terribly in front of our daughters. Sad...",

I can't eat very much in the AM so I end up sharing something with my other half. The omelets are good, salads are humongous, nothing on the Breakfast menu has disappointed. The nice thing about breakfast is that it comes with a choice of toast or coffee cake. I usually go with the toast because I LOVE coffee cake and I don't taste a drop of coffee in it.  Lunch wasn't as great. The portions are just as big enough to share. Flavor just wasn't there for me. I had the soup and salad and the hubs had  a sandwich. Everything lacked the flavor we were expecting.  Conclusion, we're only coming here for breakfast.",

    "text": "I work in the area and despite my mediocre rating, I frequent this location and have quite a few positive things to say about it. The big one is there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you will have exceptional service. The wait staff has been here for ages. I've been in the area 5 years and it's almost the same staff as when I first came in. They are pretty much on top of everything - they're attentive to when you are sat, if your drinks are running low, and they always make sure you have the check before you ask for it. Plus if you're a regular, they have down too.   While their omelettes and scrambles are quite good, I usually come here around lunch time so I'm not feeling eggy. My usual at this location is the soup (Tortilla Soup is the house soup Monday- Thursday) and half sandwich (BLT for me please). I've tried other items on the menu but each time, I wish I just stuck with my usual. Their sandwiches are bland and uneventful. Their idea of ciabatta bread is my definition of a hamburger bun...their wraps are not missing some punch.  My biggest gripe is paying the check. The cashier\\hostess stand is not an efficient set up for people coming in or wanting to get out. It's doubly worse when the cashier and the hostess are the same lady. It can get backed up pretty quickly. It stinks when you have to wait awhile to be seated for no good reason, and then have to wait even longer to pay your tab.  All in all it's nothing spectacular. There are plenty of other places in the area with more personality BUT there's nothing terrible about it - it's just a-okay.",

I took my goddaughter here on a very busy Saturday around noon and we waited for about 15 minutes.  They sat us in a booth and gave her a coloring sheet and some colored pencils to keep her occupied.  Whoever created the concept of coloring sheets at restaurants is a genius!!  Instant distraction for the wily children.  Thank you sir (or m'aam?).   My goddaughter is obsessed with noodles, and they didn't have any, much to her disappointment, but they did have a fun little kids menu so I ordered her a pb&j and some fries.  She loved her fries and did not touch the sandwich.  I ordered a half cobb salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was HUGE!  I think it needed more bacon and chicken because there was barely any on there and their blue cheese dressing tasted kind of plain.  If you're gonna splurge on calories and fat, you want some \"blow my mind\" blue cheese, right?  So yeah, I give the salad 3 stars.  I give this restaurant 4 stars though because I love their breakfast, and the service is always good.  I like the atmosphere, the feeling of being in a \"bustling\" diner.",

We got there within 5 minutes and put our name on the list and ended up waiting close to 35 minutes, again, it's a Sunday Hallmark holiday - no biggie.   Service was slow but she was super friendly and you could tell she was in the weeds. She was sweet to the kids and checked on us throughout our breakfast, she even refilled my coffee 4 times without me having to ask, extra caffeine means happy mommy. Cheers to her.   I strayed away from the traditional country fried steak and went with a Carnitas omelet - best choice of my day thus far. You also have the option of toast or homemade coffee cake...coffee cake = most amazing thing I've ever had in my life.  We'll definitely return and add this to our list of breakfast spots!",

We ordered kids chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon (3 slices) and scrambled eggs w/cheddar cheese & bacon with (not so) season potatoes & coffee cake.  The coffee cake came out warmed right away.  This is not your average coffee cake.  Its light and fluffy similar to an angel cake with strawberry & apple inside.  Apparently the flavor changes day to day - surprise.  We played 4 games of tic tac toe & the food arrived - that was quick.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The potato were very bland.  My son gobbled up his pancakes but was full about 1 1/2 cakes through.  He said he was glad we chose this place - score.  Also the waitress was great.  Prices are about average.  I would definitely come back.",

It was very reasonably priced and I will definitely keep this place in the back of my head for when I'm in town. I definitely recommend the breakfast sandwich croissant. We got our food in a very timely manner, and everything was great. The only bad part was they weren't terribly busy, two 8 tops completely open and the manager I think, maybe she was the hostess tried to offer us two booths after a 39 minute wait, we opted out and then she made it seem like she was doing us a favor by giving us one of the 8 tops. I kind of understood, because what if they had reservations but through our entire meal, the other one never became occupied. So no deal breakers for complaints! Definitely recommend this spot!",

The boy had an interesting egg-white scramble with tortilla strips and turkey which looked sloppy, but he liked it! Something really different about this breakfast joint is that you can pick between the standard toast or coffee cake - YUM!!  A super minute detail but I really enjoyed the essence of the fresh flowers. They had a bunch of items on the menu that I'm still dying to try so you can say its a place that is worth returning!",

We've now been 4x to the same location and really like the food. It's portions are generous and the food well prepared and tasty. I've had three different omelets and all were exceptional. The pancakes and French toast also great.  My ink gripe, and why my rating is what it is, has to do with service. Service at the front (seating you even when not swamped) is extremely slow. Also, wait service seems to be the same. Our last visit was horrendous. The wait staff seems large but they move in slow motion.  Prices here are also pretty high. We don't have much choice but there are probably breakfast spots as good at a lower price.",

Some of them have been here for as long as I have been coming. That low turnover rate says a lot about the company! There is counter service, tables or booths to sit at.  Daily specials are hand written on a board and tempt me every time.  I love their coffee cake! Flavors change and range from blueberry, chocolate, strawberry and pumpkin in the fall.  Fresh brewed coffee and iced tea.  Homemade ranch It's great to dip anything in! The biggest problem I have when coming here is deciding to get breakfast or lunch. Their buffalo chicken finger salad is one of my favorites. It's like they knew I wanted chicken fingers and a side salad. So they put them together. The sandwiches are great too.  And breakfast, I have a handful of favorites. The cracked croissant is my go to when I'm too indecisive/hungry or just want a familiar classic. I always get the seasoned potatoes.  The portions are generous and worth the price.",

The place was packed and there were screaming kids everywhere. Our server was very friendly but the food was pretty bad. My husband compared it to cafeteria food. I agree that it seemed like typical Las Vegas food that you would get at a local video poker bar or casino cafe.  We ordered breakfast by the way. Steak and eggs and the croissant sandwich.",

    "text": "So today is June 30th. My girlfriend and I decided to get breakfast after adventuring downtown and going to donut bar.  Unfortunately today I'm going to have to say this review should be a 1 star.  My girlfriend had initially ordered the chicken fried steak. But once we got it, she said it was all soggy. I poked my fork into it, and I didn't even hear the slightest crunch. On top of that, the gravy is a bit too thick, and the flavor just simply overpowered the taste of the steak.  Since that wasn't the best, she decided to grab the bacon cheeseburger skillet with no bacon.  It's so overloaded with cheese, that it looked unappetizing and unappealing! Basically looks like a hamburger helper with potatoes instead of macaroni!  I'm sorry to say this, but how do you mess up coffee? Like wtf how do you fuck can you mess up coffee?!  But on the plus side you guys get an extra star today because the potatoes tasted pretty good!  Service wasn't all that great.  I ordered chicken tenders, then as the waitress repeated the order back to me, she said chicken tenders, but in the end when the food came out, she brought out a chicken fried steak. If you have a piece of paper with the initial order, how are you going to bring out a different one?!   I completely lost my appetite as soon as my actual order came out. As I said earlier, the gravy's taste ruined whole dish.  We're gonna go home and recook everything we just ordered today.  Completely ruined our day.",

What I got was a flat over cooked thing with two whole pieces of bacon shoved in the middle and a lump of avocado on top that looked like a tumor.  I was shocked, I said I had expected something where the bacon and avocado was chopped up and put inside the omelette, so they took it back.  I swear they didn't even make a fresh one they just chopped up the old returned one and threw more cheese on it.  We asked to speak to the manager, I don't even think they sent him over.  Dude couldn't give two shits about the fact neither thing served was an omelet.    Never going back again, they are rude, and don't give a crap about giving good properly presented food.",

So what I got was cooked hash browns (my friend's were JUST barely cooked, not crispy at all) underneath steamed veg and then my scrambled eggs. Not integrated at all, and barely cooked, zero flavor. The onions were basically raw. No salt, no butter, no flavor. But healthy! My friend got the biscuits and gravy benedict which he liked. It was small and OK. I would try it again and get something different. Very nice staff and a great patio.",

Was expecting something denser, with a crumble but this was like Angel food cake with strawberry jam and a drizzle of icing. Not my thing. Coffee was pretty good, they could have kept it coming but were quite busy.  All in all, they deliver just what I expect of a breakfast place, though I would prefer to be happily surprised.",

When my young kid and I was waited to be seated for a time ( busy time), a couple came in and waited behind us.   The host served the couple very quickly but the couple noticed us in front of them, so they told host that we should be served before them.  So we stepped froward and smiled.  What surprised us was she replied us:\"  I  saw them first.\"  Then she ignored us and took the couple to one of the few empty booth.   So we had to wait another couple of minutes to be seated.  She didn't have any explanation or apology for inconvenience.  Even we finished the meal and paid at the counter where she also were the cashier.  She was accepted our payment without any smile or 'thank you' words, like we owed her money and didn't want customers to come again.     She is the only worst server in this restaurant or we wont go many times.   Before that the host was an lady with a white hair  who is warm and friendly, we were very satisfied with the service. I have the hospitality master degree and know that the host is very important since they make customers the first impression toward the restaurant.  I hope the manager could pay attention to this young host, I really don't want just one person lower the whole service quality of the restaurant.   Hope it could be better.",

I always opt for the coffee cake which is making my mouth drool just thinking about that sweet goodness.   Coffee is great there and the staff keeps me full. I think even Mr. Pink would tip.   Great place, highly recommended.",

    "text": "A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend.   We stopped by this location on the first day and the service was fast and friendly and I was impressed at how familiar with gluten-free dining my server was. I also loved that they have a separate gluten free menu which you can request.  SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. On my visit here I was so excited for all of these options that I ordered a bit too much food so beware, the portions are quite large.  At this location I tried the Southwest Scramble which consisted of eggs, chorizo, green peppers, pickled jalapenos, onions and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was super tasty but the hash browns stole the show - perfectly seasoned and crispy!   I also ordered two gluten-free pancakes and they were excellent - large, fluffy and a little crispy on the edges - could not tell they were gluten free!  My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! I was jealous but was more than elated with my own meal.  Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches.",

What's done with it after it's cracked is supposed to be up to the customer, hear?   It was a very tense and awkward moment. The dimwitted waitress brushed us off, and our friend had to raise her voice and repeat herself maybe three times. She also had to describe herself as the customer, lest the waitress not get it.

Everyday the offer a coffee cake (instead of toast if you prefer) & it is never the same flavor. Its nice to have something different everyday, You can also get all egg white at no extra charge. I highly recommend this place. My son only wants to eat here for breakfast. Which is fine by me.",

    "text": "My favorite go-to breakfast spot in Las Vegas.  Yes there's higher quality joints but I would go to The Cracked Egg over any breakfast chain. It's really egg-celent!    Favorites: Northshore scramble, Chorizo Skillet, Eggs Benny's.   Awesome: Complimentary Coffee Cake.  BEST COFFEE CAKE....EVER! TIP: If there's 2 of you, skip the wait and sit at the counter/bar.  The service staff is warm and friendly. My water is never empty.  The place has modest breakfast themed deco on the walls.  The wait for a seat on a weekend can take a while (sometimes up to 30min, no one likes to wait for breakfast) but we are always OK with sitting at the counter where there's usually a spot open and you get to see the action of the servers behind the counter.  The quality of the food is eggs-emplary! Everything taste fresh, including the fresh fruit if it comes with your dish.  The coffee cake is delicious (different flavors every week, my fav is the ones with fruit).  The eggs are rarely over done or underdone (I order over easy on my skillets).  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The coffee is standard but I'll let that slide cause this place isn't called \"The cracked bean\".  Overall, Cracked egg is an eggs-traordinary breakfast spot! Good eats and good meets. Try it today! YAY!",

The food is delicious! They have the best eggs benedict in town and I have tried almost everything in the breakfast menu and everything is great! The atmosphere is great and they have a great staff! Love the service!",

Seasoned potatoes are way better than a long shot vs. Egg works, perfectly seasoned and not salty as f***. anyways yeah i feel like John Smith discovering the New World. this place rocks. And our server Cory is amazing!!",
