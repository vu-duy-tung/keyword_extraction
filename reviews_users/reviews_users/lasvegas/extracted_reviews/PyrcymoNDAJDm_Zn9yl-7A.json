    "text": "I went there twice.......the first time shortly after they opened. The restaurant was half full and the food came out quickly and was tasty. I had the Zigeunerschnitzel with Spaetzle and it reminded me of back home.  The second time was three days ago and it seemed like they did not have a real chef because the food came out one at a time with very long time in between food coming from the kitchen almost as if each was cooked individually. This time the Spaetzle were a starchy, watery mess (way overcooked) not sure how somebody can screw this up. Interestingly enough the Cordon Bleu (pork) was burned around the corners and I had to work my way half way through the thing to get a bite of ham and cheese. definitely no comparison to my first visit here. I ended up being there for almost an hour.....  Pro Cheaper than others in town Friendly waitress  Cons Food inconsistent Very Slow  you feel like eating in the middle of a warehouse (no decor)  After my second experience I will definitely not go back soon. The waitress actually told the owner that I was not too happy. You'd think she would come forward from behind the counter.....well think again, obviously there is no interest in what people think.",

Cafe Berliner not only serves some of the most authentic German food in Las Vegas but very very tasty and filling with the price being right.  My wife and I had the Jaeger Schnitzel.  The mushroom gravy sauce was spot on, the cutlets properly tenderized and cooked.  The red cabbage was what I recall from my days in Germany and although the Spezi (German carbonated beverage) is a mix of American Coca Cola and Fanta Orange, it was close enough to bring back memories (German Coca Cola does not use as much sugar so its a lite beverage).   And STruedel with Vanilla cream was heavenly (we shared an apple sTruedel at the restaurant, took a cherry one home).   Cafe Berlin is a winner...",

Last night it was not thin, and the sauce was slathering the cutlets instead of on the side, and it killed the crisp. The spaetzle was very good, however. My child's chicken fingers were overcooked and dry. This in contrast to my previous review that I would have ordered the chicken fingers if I could have. The worst part was the mashed potatoes, which I seriously believe we're actually instant potatoes. C'mon! Step it up guys, or you will no longer be the best German food around!!",

It came on a big plate with a meager serving of something resembling mashed potatoes put through the meat grinder. Meat was good although it seemed a little bit on a salty side.  Here are my observations: It's lunch so I'd like to leave full (or almost) after my meal without chasing it with dessert :) So my advice is put 2 sides instead of one. Does it really cost that much extra for a dollop of sauerkraut? It probably doesn't but customer will leave full and happy (and will come back).   Based on the average price of lunch in vicinity Cafer Berlin is the most expensive one. So I would suggest to put more effort in marketing (give discount to neighborhood businesses for example).",

The place is kinda on the small side and very clean. They have a display case by the register with the desserts on display.

I ordered the wurstplate with cucumber salad and red cabbage. I really enjoyed all the sausages (4/5), especially with the senf (German mustard). The cucumber salad (5/5) was delicious. The red cabbage (3/5) was good, but I prefer it savory versus sweets for this was a tad sweet.   Overall it was great!  I would definitely come back and plan to! Yum!! :)",

This is exactly the sort of place that will appeal to those who are looking for something real and genuine in a city full of show. It's not a dive, but it's definitely got a mom and pop feel. App the place is owned by actual Germans, so that's a plus also.   The food is fantastic. I had the Wurstplatte on the first night - it's a sausage sampler platter with three different types of brat. Each was delicious. It was served with more mashed potatoes than any person should eat, but eat them I did. It was served with a German potato salad that compliThe second night I had the Sauerbraten...   My wife ordered the Frikadelle on the first night. It's a beef & gravy plate that was also very filling and super tasty - sehr lecker, as the Deutsch would say. Night two she ordered the Jager Schnitzel mit Cucumber Salad   We're glad we found this cafe. It's away from the Strip and has some amazing food.

I have had German food on a number of occasions over the years, but I am far from experienced with the cuisine. The bread was good, although a little doughier than I prefer. I enjoyed the schnitzel quite a bit. It was juicy and moist, which is important. I wasn't crazy that it just came with lettuce and mayonnaise. I guess I was hoping for something a little more flavorful. The fries were disappointing and bland, so I don't see myself ordering these again.   We also tried the apple strudel, which was tasty and had a great texture.   Service was on point and I look forward to trying this place again for a little more of their more traditional dishes. Their dinners and other lunch options look promising.",

Which seemed like a perfect time to check it out seeing how I would've missed the lunch rush. Once I walked in the door I initially noticed there was only a party of maybe 15 people sitting together eating in the entire restaurant. The woman working there did not address me she tossed a black receipt book on the counter and motioned for me to come get it. Once I asked what is this for? she said \"oh ,you aren't picking up a to go order\" I said \"No I would like to eat here. She wanted to seat me near the window. I told her that I would prefer to be seated in the back of the dining room. Then she said to me \"well if more people come in I will need those seats\" I am not sure what relevance that had on the situation but I do know that immediately after walking in the door I did not feel welcomed or respected. For that reason I left before even sitting. I will never have the opportunity to give an opinion on how good the food is because I will not be returning. They need to learn how to treat their customers or else they will be left with none,",

The food was,  hardly to, not worth eating. My beef rouladen was dry and tough and had a strip on raw bacon in it. Could only find a small piece of pickle. Couldn't eat it. It was covered with a lot of salty gravy and had no flavor. The red cabbage was nothing special, maybe out of a can. My husband had the jaeger schnitzel. It was a little better, but not much. My dinner cost us 18.99. For that price, I expect meat you can eat. We won't be going back. Wish it had been good.",

    "text": "I've had my eye on Cafe Berlin for a hot minute. Always telling myself I was going to go but I wanted to give it some time. This location has changed hands and restaurants many, many times and if Cafe Berlin was not going to last - well, I didn't want to waste my time. But a year and half later, it's still here so it was time to try the place.  Let me start with my only complaint of this place - WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME HERE!?  My memories of Germany consist of a few different things: Good Times, Good Food, Good Wine and Good Beer. Living in Germany I have the luxury of having excellent German food. Those imbiss stands though. Delicious Brats, Pomme Frites with mayo, schnitzel that would rock your socks off. After leaving Germany, I just knew that I would never have German food that good again.  Well my friends, Cafe Berlin has the most amazing Jaeger Schnitzel. It is perfectly fried with the a very nice, light & crunchy breading. It is topped with the most delicious cream sauce with mushrooms. The size of the jaeger schnitzel was slighter smaller than something you would find in Germany but in the end it was the perfect serving and I was satisfied. The spaetzle was seasoned very well and soft and pillowy.   I also ordered a side salad with German dressing. Amazing. The salad itself was nothing special but the dressing was made perfectly. Not too oily, not too much sugar, not too much vinegar. I asked for it on the side so I could dress my salad myself and I think this is key.   Last but not least, if in a German restaurant you have to have a pretzel. There is just something about a German pretzel that I love. I remember walking to the bus stop in the morning when I lived in Germany and always stopping by the bakeries to get me a warm pretzel bun. The pretzel here reminded me so much of that. It was hot, warm and soft. Served with a cheese spread. The pretzel came out so soft and warm that I couldn't wait to eat it and alas, no picture.   I left Cafe Berlin with a very happy belly. I remember just being happy overall after eating there. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I will have to visit a couple more times before I can do that. But if you want a great schnitzel, do your belly a favor and get over here today.",

Don't have a good bar to measure just how authentic of a German restaurant this is but it seemed pretty authentic to me. Excellent food and good size portions makes for a winning combination, the only thing that keeps this from getting 5-Stars is the pricing might be a bit steep. For two adults with an appetizer, no drinks and three deserts (one to take home for junior) our tab was $70. All in all a good meal and we will go back as they have several interesting dishes to try out.",

    "text": "This place is great. It's unfortunate that it took me so long to come here. It definitely met or surpassed our expectations. Great food. Friendly staff. For more detail  Food: We ordered the jaeger schnitzel, the curry wurst and finished with a cherry strudel. The curry wurst was a grilled sausage with a German curry sauce (for those who have never had it, it's kind of like a ketchup with less complex sugars and more taste) and it was good. But the jaeger schnitzel was phenomenal and definitely lived up to the recommendations. It had the perfect crisp and yet was still a succulent chop. Not to mention the mushroom gravy that it is served. Though we were pretty much full we still went for the cherry strudel and it was also amazing.   The portions are pretty decently sized and though it's not designed for family-style eating, many of the dishes are easy to share and I would encourage you to do so.  Also, when we can, I really wanna try their buffet....*Homer Simpson voice* mmmm.....sausage buffet  Drink: Besides your standard fare of soft drinks they have beer. Now, while they do not have a wide variety of beers, what they do have are good German choices. We went with the Warsteiner Dunkel, a good beer in it's own right, and a great compliment to the dishes.   Atmosphere: We went sort of near closing time so it was pretty empty. It was lavish with decorations, and still had the looks of a simple shop, but it still felt homey (to me anyways). It can, however, accommodate large groups.   Staff: Our server was very friendly and was helpful as much as possible. Since, as I noted, we went near closing and it wasn't that busy, I cannot comment how service is during a rush. But, I was pleased with their aim to please and I am willing to bet their service doesn't falter when they get busier.   Overall, the quiet little spot delivers on great food and for sure, I will be coming here again.",

My dad loves it though, so we came here tonight with the rest of my family because his friends have been telling him about this place for a while now.   I ate the pretzel with cheese, the kid's schnitzel, and the apple strudel. All DELICIOUS!  The pretzel was crisp on the outside and so soft on the inside -- perfection. It was served with cheese on the side, and let me tell you! This was not your average velveeta or nacho cheese. They have chunks of butter mixed I to the cheese, and it is topped with red onion and green onion and a slice of radish. So good and fancy, just how I love it.  I ordered the kid's schnitzel because we had the pretzel as an appetizer and I wasn't extremely hungry. This was a good portion! My mom ordered an adult portion of schnitzel and while my meal came with one piece, hers came with two. So my point is that my meal wasn't too tiny at all. Also, the kid's schnitzel is usually made with pork, but I asked for chicken instead and they were kindly accommodating. They told me that all meals are made to order and it isn't a problem to specialize and order. My crispy schnitzel was served with tasty fries, which I used to finish off the extra cheese from the pretzel, haha.  Oh my goodness, the apple strudel was just lovely! It was served with whipped cream and vanilla sauce. Each of these components made for a beautiful dessert and such a wonderful finish to my dinner.   When we come back, I'm probably going to order everything just like I did this time. So yummy!",

Checked out the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to find the best German food I've eaten since well... Germany!   Heidelberg and Berlin.   Don't mind the strip mall ambiance...  This is the real deal and worth every penny!   Owners are serious about the food and care about what they serve.   I had the jaeger schnitzel and spaezle...  There was a hint of nutmeg on The spaezle..  Which is a great detail most miss.   The Championne mushrooms in the schnitzel were Devine...  My warsteiner dunkel heffeweizen on tap was fantastic...  I took a slice of apfel strudel home and it was superb with a cup of coffee.  I recommend this restaurant and will be back for more!",

Of course, it paired well with the creamy mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Grain mustard is also offered. This plate is filling and well worth the price.   I still had a little room for apple strudel and single espresso. I'm so happy I had this. It was just apple without the crazy amount of sweetness brought on over sugar-ing. Even the strudel sauce was like this. The pastry has no sugar in it at all, it's purely an apple show! Ich liebe es! Ich empfehle es sehr!  Surprisingly or not surprisingly, they have Warsteiner beer on tap!",

My wife and I love German food and we were really looking forward to trying this place out.    Wifey spent much of her childhood in Germany and loves Jaeger schnitzel.  She was not pleased with the version here.  Usually the cutlets are pounded thin, these were uncharacteristically thick.  The breading was way too salty.  I tried a bite and did not want another.  Note: I've never met a schnitzel I didn't like.  I'm a schnitzel eating fool, but I didn't want a second bite.  Nuff said.  I'm all about the wurst over here, so I went with the Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst.  They come to the table leaning casually on a mound of mashed potatoes, full of promise.  Right alongside, in perfect counterpoint, sits a generous serving of sauerkraut.  It was such a pretty picture.  But damn my eyes!  It looked WAY better than it tasted.    I feel obligated to apologize for saying this, but the mashed potatoes were terrible.  They were whipped into oblivion.  The texture was unpleasant, the taste was unappealing.  At the same time, however, the kraut was exceptionally good.  The sausages were the biggest disappointment.  I don't think I even finished them.  Even with a good beer, I was like, no.  My nephew accompanied us and he got the Bratwurst burger.  He said it was great.  If I went back, that's what I'd try.    Mikey C says:  I'll be back.",

As last time the schnitzel was a little over cooked and seemed over salted this time. It would have been too dry without the gravy. The potato salad was cubed potato's with some onions served cold, and the sauerkraut was plain. Neither items were as tasty as previous. The sliced cucumber salad had a nice balance of sweet & sour. The sausages were cooked with a nice amount of crisp on the casing.   The restaurant was doing a brisk business with the staff working hard to keep up. Overall the experience on this visit was not as satisfying as previous.",

I have fond memories of being raised by my German grandmother who was born in Berlin, and the dishes served at Cafe Berlin are remarkably close to ones she cooked for our family. The thin and crispy potato pancakes appetizer with a side of applesauce, the salty, warm pretzel with mustard and cheese, and the sauteed onions over the juicy bier bratwurst send me right back to childhood. My husband ordered the Rahm with freshly made spatzel which brought a smile to his face.

Schnitzel it was and I went gypsy-style, while me wife went Rahm. all-around delicious choices, with plenty of food and helpful staff.   It was very busy, and they seemed a bit understaffed but still did a great job getting us and our wheelchair-dependent little one to a table. There was some confusion between the first person who took our drinks order and the server, because they never did bring out the wine my wife ordered or the water I ordered (they did get her water and my German beer, though!)... so a point off, but overall was a great choice.

The restaurant itself is not that big, but still has a number of tables. There happened to be live music when we went on a Saturday night, which was a pleasant surprise.  We were seated by an employee but the waitress didn't notice we were there for several minutes, and apologized when she finally became aware of our presence. xD For the rest of the meal, service was very friendly. The employees are actually German and very proud of this little restaurant; the owner apparently came here from Germany just to open this restaurant!  My friend and I decided to order their sampler platter, which came with A TON of food, though we managed to finish it all. The spaetzle had a really nice texture, and the schnitzel had a really nice, cripsy texture (similar to tonkatsu). Prices are medium, and portions are decent. The food is definitely authentic and tasty!  They also offer a buffet-style dinner on the first Saturday of every month; will have to come try it someday!  This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall in a random strip mall, but worth checking out for sure!",

The server told us that is was enough for 3 people, but for us, it would've been enough for 4!  Schnitzel, sausages and spatzel were delicious!  I especially loved their red cabbage and sauerkraut.  We also ordered the roulade which was tender and full of flavor.  I also enjoyed the appetizer sampler.  Yes, we over ordered, but we took the leftovers home and the four of us enjoyed the food again for a meal the next day!  We will be back! :)",

    "text": "Had lunch at Cafe Berlin on a Monday.  Eventually the place was well over half full and doing a brisk business.  I bought the yelp deal, which was $20 for $15.  Only 25% off, but I am not going to complain about someone giving me $5 to eat at a place I wanted to try anyway.  I had the jaegerschnitzel and a bier bratwurst on the side.  If they are offering homemade sausages for $2.99 to add to your meal, it would have been rude of me not to get one, right?  The jaegerschnitzel is made with either pork or chicken.  I've only had this dish previously with veal, but the pork was good.  It comes with mushroom gravy and a good sized helping of spaetzle.  The spaetzle was slightly grilled, which gave it some texture.  This dish can be a bit too \"mushy\" for me at times.  I loved a bite with the crispy pork, brown gravy and spaetzle.    The sausage was big time, juicy and grilled perfectly.  As much as I enjoyed the jaegerschnitzel, I think the sausage was the star.  We had good service, didn't wait too long for our lunches, but we had to wait some time for refills of our drinks.  The parking lot is small, and there are several restaurants, so that's a minus.  It's easy off and on for the 215, so that's a positive.  I'm sure I'll return.",

We got the sample platter ($39.99) and tried a bit of everything. I'd say all of it was good. The sausages were my favorite (Dinner plates approx. $15). We also got a side of German potato salad ($4) and it was the perfect mix. We will definitely go again.   It's a pretty relaxed environment. The inside looks more like a quick diner wedged in a shopping center. It's got a small area for bar seating if you want to grab a good German beer ($4-$6). Good for kids too. We had our 18 month old who acted completely obnoxious and she was tolerated. Other families had children there as well. There is a kids menu, but for dinner they ranged in the $7-$10 range. I'd say go there and spend about $20-$25 each, add more if you drink! Again, the food was delicious and worth it for the occasional splurge! Very friendly staff.",

We ended up trying the appetizer platter which gave us a wonderful sampling of the menu. I. Loved. Every. Bite. The Wurst were fresh and juicy, the schnitzel was crisp and bursting with flavor!! They had a selection too of red cabbage or sauerkraut, spetzle, and mashed potatoes- all cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with an amazing and warm apple strudel. I wish we had room to try their blueberry and cherry, but we will be back again soon!!",

You can go to 'German Disneyland' at Hofbrauhaus, or dig in here were it feels like the real world. Staff is friendly, food is home cooking, and if you sprechen die Deutsch your in for some lively conversation with real folks. Wirklich wunderbar!",

Our waitress was paying attention to everything we were doing: like I had a glare from one of the Window, she asked if the glare bothered me, she could lower one of the shades..... Waiters and waitresses going out of their way is rare... So, overall? It's an A+!!!! We will go back from now on, this will be our hangout place, and I hope you get this place a try!",

However the rotating images of different dishes shown on the big screen dissuaded me from getting the currywurst here as it looked like a sweating heap of ketchup and Oscar Meyer franks. The waitress also informed me the goulash would be a better choice and I am a sucker for good spaetzle. When it arrived I was pretty disappointed in the taste. The goulash was tasteless, each piece of meat had a giant strip of fat and the spaetzle was way creamier/more buttery than any I've had in Germany or elsewhere. Because it was quite expensive and I didn't want to have to eat it again I ate it all, but really didn't enjoy it. My friend got the jaegerschnitzel and that too had a greasy nasty taste to it. He said it was just ok.  For the price and overall decor I would not come back again. I'd rather have no German food than this German food.",

My friend and I decided to hit up Cafe Berlin. She never had German food before. Me? Had it many times abroad. I was more than happy to order anything and everything on the menu. Just to try out if it's really authentic.   Since it's my friend's first time eating German food, the server suggested the Sampler Platte. It's basically bratwurst, sauerkraut, mashed potato and schnitzel. Good serving for two people.  They also have daily specials however if you do show up near closing time, they usually run out by then. Oh draft beer specials. Please just drink German beer and stay away from American beer. It'll go well with your meal. Trust me.   Def would recommend Cafe Berlin to anyone craving German food.",

Not spicey and just good home type cooking from scratch. The price is a little high but it is not fast food. There is a buffet on the first Saturday of the month with reservations. It includes some drinks and some dessert. Its about $25 a person so come hungry. It is located at Sunset and Decatur and the night of the buffet it is only the buffet with reservations. They make everything fresh so it needs to be made ahead and they don't want to run out. Try it...you won't regret it if you like German food.",

We used to go to the German restaurant in Paradise road because the location was very convenient.  Cafe Berlin is was smaller and more intimate. I like it that it's not very loud. The lady who seated us and was serving us was very friendly and helped us to choose from the menus because we are not experts in German food.  The thing which I liked the most is that there is a screen on the wall which shows almost all staple dishes they have on the menu. It made our life so easy!  The food was amazing and reasonably priced! I literally now want to try everything on the menu.",

We enjoy our first visit but couldn't really recall much about the food, service or atmosphere. We definitely wanted to return, but with so many choices, it took some time to return.   For a appetizer we had to get a pretzel, comes to the table piping hot served with mustard and a ' cheese/onion spread.   I'm a big sausage eater and knew I would get the 'wurstplatte'. It comes with three types of sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. My first bite, the juices and flavors exploded in my mouth. It was really good, the sauerkraut was not too sour or salty, but had a bold taste.   For dessert I had the Black Forest cake. It was moist, three layers with bits of cherries in between. It was a great choice.   Service was good, the food was delicious. I also was impressed with how much the owners care about the place, not only in the good food and service but also in how clean they keep it! I will be back, so many other great items to try, maybe a 'bier brat sandwich'.",

My husband and I split the chicken cordon bleu.  It was a great lunch.  I loved the cranberry relish that came with it,  the chicken was perfectly fried, and the flavors were fantastic together.

    "text": "I am a fan of German food and I come from a long line of Pennsylvania Dutch cooks. We will be back.  The bullet points:  Pros: Great food Good service Nice facility  Cons: Cooking time (potentially) A bit pricey  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The details:  Pros: Great food - Tasty wursts, well-seasoned meatloaves, crispy-tender schnitzel, giant soft pretzels with crispy crusts and soft and squishy insides, spaetzle with a good amount of chew, nicely flavored sauerkraut and red cabbage and pickled cucumbers on the side, & fresh veggies. The portions were very large, so we have lunch for tomorrow. Yay!  Good Service - When we came in on Saturday just before 5:30, there were 2 friendly ladies on the floor. We were seated quickly, we got our drinks and ordered as soon as we were ready, and they were very attentive throughout our meal. We got our check quickly and they were nice enough to pack up our leftovers for us.  Nice Facility - The tables, floor, and fixtures were clean and well maintained. The bathrooms were clean. The decor was kind of steam punk-ish?, but hung together nicely enough. Lots of curtains allowed some natural light in without leaving us blinded by direct sunlight. It's also pleasantly quiet. While I am, sometimes, in the mood for loud music and raucous crowds, sometimes, I just want a peaceful meal with my family; Cafe Berlin delivered.  Cons: Cooking time - The menu clearly states that some food takes longer to serve because they make it from scratch. I can appreciate that, and I didn't mind, but it's something to be aware of if you have a show or a movie to plan around.  Maybe a bit pricey - Ok, so it's not cheap, but I am still willing to pay, and tip, for good quality food that is prepared well. It's not a deal breaker.  Overall: We'll be back and we'll recommend to others.",

We ended up asking one of the servers if we could get some drinks, appetizers and place an order which deducts a point.  I ended up ordering a schnitzel with potato salad. The schnitzel was great but the potato salad wasn't quite what I was expecting traditional German potato salad to taste like. I am from Europe myself and I can't imagine that it's one of their traditional side dishes.  However, another reason this place is the reason that one if the kitchen workers came out from behind and he was wearing flip flops which is really unsafe as well as unsanitary.",

    "text": "I came here on a whim with Don earlier today. When we were trying to go to another restaurant and found out Sunset doesn't connect to Valley View. We just entered the plaza and decided to eat at Cafe Berlin since neither of us has ever had German food before. When we entered the restaurant, there were absolutely no customers and there were three people at the counter talking to each other (waitress, possible owner, and another guy). The waitress quickly brought out menus for us and got our drink orders (coffee and Spezi. She was definitely German, she had a very heavy German accent and everything; it was pretty cool.   I wouldn't say we really ordered authentic German dishes since I just got the daily special Gyspy Style Sausage w/ french fries ($6.50) and Don got The North German burger ($8.50) with a side of Spaetzle ($2.95), but they were still very good. My sausage really tasted homemade and had a lot of flavor and the french fries that came with it were cooked to perfection. Don's burger had beef chuck, garlic shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and coleslaw. The garlic shrimp were definitely an interesting, yet tasty, little add-on.   While we were eating, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted refills, of course we said yes. However, I wish I hadn't because I ended up getting charged for every cup of regular coffee I got. I really bugs me when people charge per cup of REGULAR coffee. I would've gotten some other beverage, like Spezi, since that came bottomless.   Aside from the coffee ordeal, I enjoyed this place. The waitress was very attentive and the food was appetizing.",

I had a pretzel with cheese which was incredible. They baked it fresh and brought it right out of the oven. It was great.   Then I had the sausage with potatoes and red cabbage. I was very skeptical of the cabbage but the entire meal was just incredible. the staff was great too! They are from Germany, very hospitable and helped with recommending items on the menu.

The pork looked burnt at first but was perfectly cooked. Despite being smothered in a delicious mushroom gravy, it retained a certain crunchiness.  The spaetzl was a little off putting to me. Its taste was not unlike egg and starch. I ate it but I had to mix it with the gravy on my plate. The apple sTruedel was supurb. Very sweet though. The flakey chewieness with the crunch from the walnuts was great and the warm vanilla sauce was heavenly.  As for the restaurant itself, unimpressive yet redeeming. It is not full of the stereotypical Bavarian decor found in other establishments. It stays below that irritating status of kitch. The only thing German in the restaurant, other than the food, is a couple of German flags and empty bottles of Warsteiner beer on the tables. It is small and simple with good food and good service.  I hate to give 3 stars but with a poor location, lack luster ambience and higher price ($15+/person), I have to.  Still, I would like to go back a couple more times for sausage and burgers.",

We met some friends there on Monday at 6:30, we had some other friends that couldn't make it til 7. Little did we know, they close at 7, the staff was so nice, they never said anything, kept a smile on their face and kept serving us. I felt so bad after I had found out we kept them there late. I had the Rahm Shnitzel, the portion was huge. It was cooked perfectly, not greasy. The gravy was yummy. The spaetzle was a bit crispy which I'm not use to but it was good. Doug go the West German burger with fries, he was happy with his meal. We saved room for some Apple Strudel, it was really good, the vanilla sauce on the side was killer, I could've eaten it like soup. I'd be interested in trying their breakfasts or some of their fresh deli meat selections. They need to get a liquor license, a good German beer with some Brats would be great.

When we were there on a Saturday night, they had a two-man band playing some German folklore music. As appetizer we had the Gulasch soup, which was excellent, just the right amount of spicyness. The German cook even came to our table to explain to us who thus soup is made. There is a variety of schnitzels on the menu, my wife decided to try the Zigeunerschnitzel, which has a tasty paprika based sauce. Myself took the wurstplatte, which comes with three different kinds of sausages and sauerkraut. For drinks, they have 3 German beers on tap and many more in a bottle. On a hot Las Vegas day the Radler (mix of lager and lemonade) is just perfect. The only mistake we made was that we did not left any space for dessert- yes, they have the original Black Forest chocolate cake! Overall, if you are up for an authentic German experience, you can find your \"heimat\" here.",

I have lived here long enough to remember The Alpine Village on Paradise Road. That was an outstanding place to eat and have FUN downstairs. My wife lived in Zurich Switzerland for almost 30 years and is qualified to judge German food. She gave Cafe Berlin 2 thumbs up. We are both looking forward to going back to sample the rest of the menu. Is it the best in Las Vegas? Hell, I don't know, but it is good.",

Mashed potatoes were runny and not enough of them. Sauerkraut was very tasty. Price per dinner for what you get is not worth it.

    "text": "I had dinner with a friend at the Cafe Berlin.  We are both from out-of-town and neither of us is German.  The menu was meat-based with pork offerings being the most abundant.  There were several Schnitzel and sausage options. The atmosphere was gemutlich (comfortable, cozy, homey) as there was a live two-man band offering a variety of German and non-German music for our dining pleasure.  The musicians were also engaging with the patrons and their varied instruments made heads turn. The food was cooked to perfection and it was clear that the chef had a deep understanding of how German food presents its flavors.  The food does not use a wide assortment of herbs and spices, but rather the essence of the natural combined ingredients creates the flavor. The portions were extraordinarily generous and it was a struggle to save room for dessert.  The Black Forest cake with hand-whipped cream was our choice (we had to share it because we were stuffed from the meal). Our waitress/hostess explained the meals and the preparation.  She was on the excitement curve with regards to letting us know what the restaurant offerings were. If you have never had German food before, I would say that this is an excellent venue to pick up a good variety of the cuisine.  While neither of us drinks, we did note that the Cafe Berlin offers German wines and beers. Oh, and don't forget to check their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cafeberlinlv.com%2F&s=2a777ee9c14f9c4cf1cab12fccc14d685fddfa3bc1f00890eae4afd861128006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cafeberlinlv.com</a>",

I also expect things like sauerbraten on a buffet that is $21+ a person.  So overall, very good food, just a little too expensive.  $16.99 adults would have been more palatable.

The mushroom gravy was delicious. I didn't finish all of the Spatzel, but I really wanted to try the potato pancakes - they were by far the best I have ever had.

We also ordered a mixed salad that was pretty large and we shared. For dessert, we had the cherry streudel that came with an awesome cream sauce to pour on top. Since I checked in on Yelp, we received the 10% discount. :-)  My only negative would be that the restaurant is very casual and doesn't have a lot of ambiance.  The floors are the epoxied style similar to what someone would have in a garage. This did make the restaurant loud and felt more like a fast casual than a sit down restaurant. The entire building, including the bathrooms, was very clean; even my husband commented on how clean the bathrooms were.",

    "text": "As everyone knows, Ich liebe deutsches essen (I love German food)!!!  So we decided to place an order via Amazon Restaurants.  We've ordered from Cafe Berlin twice.  First time was perfect, second time was not.    We ordered exactly the same food both times.  3 orders of Pork Cordon Bleu with fried potatoes (not French fries, they will substitute), 2 sides of red garbage, 2 spaetzle's and 2 bread dumplings.  We asked for the gravy on the side.  The schnitzels were dry but still tasty, last time the cheese was oozing out.    They didn't send any gravy.  Seems like a trivial issue, right? Well when you get containers of food that would typically have gravy and you've paid over $100 for delivery it's disappointing.  I get mistakes happen.  We called and \"reported\" it to the restaurant.  The woman on the phone was less than friendly and absolutely not empathetic at all.  Bread dumplings with no gravy and dry spatetzel is typical she said.  Well I disagree as the first time we ordered, gravy was sent.  It's like a staple.  Do you eat French fries without ketchup?? What's worse, she blamed the delivery driver!?  Not sure what I expected the woman to do as we lived far enough from the restaurant but a simple, \"I am so sorry\" would have been nice.  Needless to say, I chopped up an onion and some butter with some flour, water and German seasonings and made my own damn gravy.  Not sure if I'll be back as customer service here is lacking and she gave us the feeling that our business meant nothing.",

    "text": "I'm not a big fan of German food, but my husband craves spaetzle every so often, so I yelped til I found Cafe Berlin.  Not all German restaurants have non-pork options, but CB allows a chicken sub for their schnitzels.  This was perfect for my husband and helps bump this review up.  He ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and I got the spaetzle with mushroom sauce.  Turns out, they're exactly the same dish except his has the schnitzel.  I wish I had known that.  His schnitzel was perfectly cooked chicken breast.  I don't like white meat, and this is one of the few times that I can say I've ever enjoyed it.  The spaetzle was of the longer variety, and they did pan fry it before adding the gravy.  The gravy was a bit salty and too heavy.    Service was friendly, and one of the ladies there even let me try their cheese sauce that usually comes with the pretzel.  If you like your soft pretzel light and airy, you should def order it here, b/c the cheese sauce was incredible.  I could eat a shoe with that sauce.  Overall, this was a really good experience and I'm sure is much better than going to the more touristy places in town.  Also, on the first Saturday of every month, they have a buffet, which sounds pretty fun.",

    "text": "Came here to try their monthly buffet and have decided this place is mediocre at best...This place is way over-rated! How they have an average of nearly 5 stars is beyond me because I would not come back, especially at the prices they're charging! $22.99 for a dinner buffet is ridiculous when you walk in and see this hole in the wall joint and their tiny spread of about 7 or 8 items on the \"buffet\", with most of those items being sides such as sauerkraut, red cabbage, mashed potates, spaetzle, etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked the sides, but just wish there were more entree type items instead of just the 4: assorted sausages, schnitzel, roasted chicken, and some hamburger patty looking thing .  The dessert spread is also a joke, with most of it being stale and looking worse than Hostess packaged snacks...why wasn't there any Black Forest cake or strudel? And why does a German buffet serve stale cupcakes and cookies? The buffet includes a soft drink but if you want beer that will cost extra. If you want a pretzel or real dessert, such as strudel, you'll have to pay extra too. So where does the $22.99 I'm paying for the \"buffet\" go?   The staff was nice and kept coming by to check on us and refill our drinks. There was a little confused when we arrived because they couldn't figure out my reservation and we eventually figured out that they had for some reason crossed me off the list even though a reserved tag with my name on it was cleared set on the table. Reservations are recommended here at any given time because their place is so tiny and it for some reason gets very packed.  I wouldn't say that I'm an expert when it comes to German food but I've definitely had some way better places, and at cheaper pricing too. There aren't many German joints in Vegas but I'd say one of my favorites anywhere is still Hoffbrauhaus, which is surprisingly cheaper than this place! Yeah it doesn't make sense to me either...I'd say skip this place and save your money!",

Long review: let me start with the main reason you're interested in this review-the food was beyond reasonably priced, authentic and generously portioned. My husband and I split the sampler platter for $43.99 which is great if you want a good portion of everything; note to self, we barely finished half, and we were stuffed! The sampler came with red and white sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, spaetzle smothered in butter, pickled cucumber salad, brown and yager gravy, at least two different juicy sausages, two moist and flavorful meat loaf patties and two generous portions of moist and tender schnitzel. The one con is that we were so stuffed, we had no room for dessert :/   The owner or manager, Bertram, was very hospitable and attentive. He affirmed that all the recipes were authentic, from his family. Ramona, our server, was so kind, patient and attentive-we even had a pleasant conversation about Germany and our families, over dinner.   You do not have to go to the strip for a great meal! We cannot wait to go back. Ich liebe the food at cafe Berlin, and the people that work there aren't that bad, either.",

    "text": "Das Essen ist wunderbar!   Who knew you could find authentic German food in the Las Vegas Valley? Cafe Berlin is randomly placed in the tiniest strip mall ever with two other food places and a insurance office. Weird.  I noticed this place after pumping gas across the parking lot and decided to try it out. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the decor; the place is set up like an old school cafeteria buffet with Red, Yellow, and Black colors everywhere to represent the German Flag. There are also a lot of German themed posters and even a clock that gives the current time for Las Vegas and the current for the city of Berlin. I was happily greeted at the door and was told I could sit anywhere.   I sat down and browsed the menu and immediately noticed numerous tasty delicacies which reminded me of my Gam-Gam's cooking. I mean we're talking bratwurst, liverwurst, and a new thing I had never heard of called, \"Currywurst\". I saw the house special and thought to myself, \"when in Germany\"...\"I'll have the Jaeger Schnitzle and the Spaeztle please!\" Within about 10 minutes I had a piping hot plate of authentic German food in front of me. If you're not familiar with Schnitzle it's basically a meat of some type, usually pork, that has pounded flat, breaded, and fried. Yummy!   This plate of food was delicious! The Schnitzle, in this case pork, was super tender and cooked perfectly; juicy on the inside, nice and crunchy on top. This plate of food also came with a side dish called Spaeztle, which is a soft egg noodle with very little taste. I mixed mine with the mushroom gravy that was on top of my Schnitzle. Even though there wasn't much flavor on these noodles they still added to the meal and complimented the saltines of the gravy.   I inhaled this meal and was a fat, happy little German boy all over again. Just as I was awakening from my food coma and was just about to pay the check, I saw a giant pretzel come out of the kitchen, made in-house and fried to order. This giant twisted carb loaded goodness would not escape my grip and I ordered one for the road. I actually ate half of it on my way home, so soft and delicious how could you say no? This giant knotted doughy treat come with two different dipping sauces: a cheese and dijon mustard. So good!   Cafe Berlin is awesome. Great customer service, quick food preparation and a very chill atmosphere. They also serve a small selection of German beers if you feel like getting the full Berlin experience.   I will definitely be back to try the Wurstplate with three different types of sausage goodness.   Alveterzane!",

My husband had the Rahm schnitzel, which came with a white gravy and spaetzle, and he thought it was great.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful the whole time, so service gets an A plus. The food was really good, but I also don't have anything to compare it to and can't vouch for it's authenticity - although, I'm sure it is pretty authentic according to other reviewers. I also had the pleasure of having the strudel, which was a bit too sweet for my taste, but still delicious.   It was a great experience, and I'll be sure to go back. Only four stars for not serving beer to eat with the delicious food.",

Although I ended up giving the Zigeuner Schnitzel a try, and was extremely pleased, I had buyer's remorse after the delivery of my colleageus' bier bratwursts!  The quaint ambiance could use a little more to add to the vibe, but it wasn't necessary with the awesome staff taking orders in heavy German accent, and the delicious food.  Why fake it with a bunch of lederhosen and collectible steins.  If I really want that I'll visit that other extremely annoying place with mediocre mass produced food.  I like this place...and I think Grandma will love it too!",

Both of us have traveled (and eaten) quite a bit in Germany and tend to enjoy the cuisine. We had the jaeger schnitzle and a knockwurst lunch platters. The schnitzle was crispy and tasty but not greasy, as some schnitzles can be. My favorite part was the spaetzle and gravy that was served alongside. (Why oh why can't spaetzle be more widely available? It's a great \"comfort food\".) The knockwurst was a bit more peppery than those I've had before but was grilled nicely and had flavor. The red cabbage was excellent. Not too sour and just the right amount of crunch and tang.   We will certainly come back soon to try more schnitzles and dive into their sandwiches. I wonder if we can convince them to add a sauerbraten to the menu too?....",

The restaurant was empty and just some employees staying in a corner and chating in german language. They welcome us and after we exchanged some words about how we heard about the place we placed the order. Chicken snitzel with spaetzel for me and red cabbage with sausages for my fiance. The snitzel was very oily and this is a very good reason for me to don't eat there again. But the real reason was the long hair I found in the spatzel after I completed more than half of portion. This is a big issue for a restaurant. Probably they don't meet the basic standards in the kitchen. I tried to calm myself and don't do a scene in the restaurant in the front of my fiance. We were very embarrassed about this, we were totally shocked because it was the first time when this happened to us. I understand the accidents might happen but if as cook you cover your hair during the work this can prevent all this kind of stuffs. After we paid the bill and tipped I decided to tell to the host what happened. I can't remember any apologies came from that lady. It was the first and last time when we stepped into that place. I will make sure my friends won't ever go there. That's the way it supposed to work.",

My mom got the Rahm schnitzel which she said was just \"ok.\" The cream gravy was very thick. I had the Cordon Bleu vom Schwein schnitzel which was very dry. No bread, soup or salad comes with these $17.00 entrees either. The spaetzle was tasteless and the red cabbage was awful. We were not offered dessert and because they just got their liquor license and had no beer or wine yet, we brought in our own bottle of wine (which we were handed a bottle opener to open ourselves) Let's not forget to mention the fact that gnats were flying around the entire time. I spent four years in Germany, Oberammergau to be specific, saying this place is authentic is a joke!!!!",

Food is incredible but if your nervous about trying German cuisine order the Brat burger it's the fusion of German meets American trust me you will not be disappointed multiple German beers even if you're not a drinker they even have German NA mix it with cola try the famous German Kola Beer",

Which comes served with German potato salad and sliced cucumbers. Service is always nice and I have never had a bad meal here.  I usually order the pork but today tried the chicken. Both are very good, lightly breaded crisp and golden brown.   The wait was a little longer than usual today so the waitress gave me a apple strudel on the house! Enjoy the pic and pop in when you feel the urge for some German food done right.  Danke Cafe Berlin! I will be back again.",

The live music is good (hope you like accordions and traditional German music) and the staff are German and very friendly hard workers.   My friend said the food was amazing and reminded her of her trip, and I also enjoyed the food! They give you a large portion so be prepared for that. I recommend the onion bread twists for appetizers, and pretty much any of the dinner items. We all liked what we got.   I prefer this over the German place off of flamingo - that place is more about live entertainment instead of a traditional experience.",

The lovely ladies were super sweet and made us feel right at home, they even spoke German to my fiance. We went for the Sampler Platte, which was a great choice. It had a great variety of authentic German food including schnitzel, red cabbage, frikadelle, spaetzel, and bratwurst over mashed potatoes and & sauerkraut and cucumber salad on the side. It was very filling for 2 people and so lecker (yummy). We also ordered a pretzel because I knew it would be fresh, and I was right. It was warm, salty & delicious with their home made mustard. We took home a piece of Black Forest Cake for later, and I can't wait to eat it. We will definitely be back to eat here, looking forward to the buffet on the first Saturday of the month.",

It is a cute little restaurant with a couple of large wooden bench style seating spaces among traditional diner seating options.  The service is outstanding; I feel very welcome here.  You will definitely hear some of the staff speaking with a German accent, which is helpful when learning how to pronounce the menu items.  So far, my favorite items are: Frikadelle, Sauerbraten, Sauerkraut, and of course the pretzel with mustard.  Overall, everything I've tried so far is good.  If you're not certain what you may like, a sampler platter is the way to go.  There is also a dinner buffet the first Saturday of each month.  I called and made a reservation for the buffet dinner.  When we got there the place was almost completely full.  The buffet price includes a non-alcoholic beverage and dessert (there is a chiller dessert display near the buffet table; self-serve just like the rest of the buffet).  There are two different items featured in each of the large chafing dishes; about a dozen different items to try.  Three different types of gravy, By the plates and utensil area there is also a cucumber salad, potato salad, pats of real butter and the bread is baked at the restaurant.  The bread is chewy with a crispy crust and oh my so delicious!  The dessert featured the night we went was homemade chocolate mousse.  One of the staff members explained to us how they prepare it from scratch.  Oh so good!  We plan on returning soon to try more menu items.",

Ordered more to go as we were thankful for the relief for our palettes as we hadn't been back to Germany for 2 years. The owner is very nice, and all were friendly and helpful.

I have to say, that I of course am not German, but have probably spent about 5-6 months of time overall in Germany over the many years.  1. The sausages - I am here for sausages and one other thing, or two other things really.  They do not disappoint. I have had all of their sausages here, the Neurnberger, the Bier Bratwurst, the bratwurst and the curry wurst.   Each is very good, but I enjoy the larger sized sausages, so the Bier Bratwurst, the bratwurst and the Curry Wurst are all my favorites.  Each dish will come with sauerkraut. I cannot say I am a  connoisseur of fermented cabbage, although I love Kim Chee.  So I will just say I ate all my sauerkraut and no problem!  2.  The Pretzel- Yep, the second reason I am here is for the big ass pretzel.  What a great tasting pretzel.  If you get it with the Obatzer Kase spread, it is delicious.  3.  The Beer - Yep a whole pitcher of German Draft Beer.  How can you go wrong.  Come here, relax, chill out, have bit of Black Forest Cake when you are done.  Don't expect the quickest German efficient service, don't expect to get everything in a second or to be perfect.  Just accept that this is a family run place and that the food is pretty darn good and authentic.  GK says, check it out.",

Cooked, seasoned and presented humbly but with a touch of elegance with the spaetzle on the side.   Server was personable and attentive. Enjoyed the Koenig Ludwig Dunkel and Apple strudel. A bit pricey but that's the only thing about the place that I didn't find favorable. I'd go back.",

It's located in the same proximity as Phat Prank's, SinCity Burgers, and Popeyes, I believe a Hawaiian restaurant use to be there.   For food their menu consist of various sausages, sandwiches/burgers, and dishes like Schweine Schnitzel \"Wiener Art\" and Cordon Bleu com Schwein. They also make strudels and other pastries.  I decided on the Bratwurst Burger, I believe it was a 1/2 lbs burger topped with sauteed onions. It was very delicious and juicy. It also came with some fries, all for $8.50. It seems like they use to have 4 burgers the North, South, East, and West Burgers but crossed it off their menu for the Bratwurst Burger.  They also have some Euro Cup soccer or football specials. My other friends went with the Bier Bratwurst Stadium Style with German mustard and fries, it looked good too. They said it tasted good.  Conversed with owners. They were very friendly and always checking on us. They've been open for about 2 month and still fine tuning their restaurant. Their son is handling all of the marketing and business aspects of the restaurant. He said they have lots of deals on yelp but I couldn't them, all good maybe next time.  There was a Euro cup game playing between Germany and Greece. When we came in it 1-0 Germany when we left it was 4-1 and Germany dominated, you're welcome LOL. It seems like a place that should service German beer too. At least they're working on getting their liquor license, so I can't wait for that.  There are a lot of seats and tables for dining. There's also large USA and Germany flags hanging on the walls with a flat screen tv.  Updated...I actually paid about $13 for my burger, fries, and water which is kinda price for what I got. So reduced from 4 to 3.",

It's in a strip mal behind an ARCO station and upon entry the decor looks like a steam puck art gallery after it's been looted. That's the end of the negatives as far as location and appearance.  The nitty gritty, My buddy orders the bratwurst platter and I order the Jagerschnitzel, we split an order of Kartoffel-Pfannkuchen. He seemed to like his brats, he wolfed them down. The Kartoffel-Pfannkuchen was perfectly thin and crisp. My Jagerschnitsel was awesome. crisp and crunchy even with the gravy. I have never been a fan of spoetzel but theirs is brilliant.   My only complaint on the food and drink is the beer prices. There's no excuse to charge $10.00 for a beer when you don't have to smuggle it out of Germany under your coat. Other then this point, It's a 4.5 and a must visit",

    "text": "Visited relatives in Las Vegas along with a cousin from LA, and we decided we wanted to try German food and this place came up on top of the list.  There's really not much more to add that hasn't been said in this listing... it's a hole in the wall next to a gas station strip mall-ish place, cool pipe wall lighting, and standard cafeteria style seats and tables--in other words, no frills.  We ordered from the dinner menu, and got the \"works\" good enough for two people.  The food, as expected, is good, salty and flavorful.  The order to share came with a couple of schnitzel, sausages, and a type of pork burger patties, all laid on top of purple cabbage, sauerkraut, and mashed potato.  We also ordered a plate of schnitzel for a third person in our party. What struck me as rather interesting is that everything on the platter could have easily been 'replicated' by buying sausages, meat patties, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and frozen ready-made schnitzel from a reputable grocery store.  Nothing really special particularly since the price for this platter was a whopping $44.  So overall, dinner, sodas and tip for the three of us came out to about $85!    Don't get me wrong, the service was excellent, and food was good and as authentic as German food can get.  However, given the spartan hole-in-the-wall ambiance and the type of food served, paying close to $30/pp for a couple sausages, meat patties and fried meat seemed a little steep. I don't regret going and trying it out, but I can easily replicate this meal by getting the ingredients from the local farmers market or European deli, putting on table cloth and lighting up some candles... and still get a similar if not better experience!",

We arrived late (The place closes at 8:00 PM Monday through Friday) so we ordered a combo meal to go.  Like most places in the valley, this place is located in a small strip mall behind a fast food restaurant and a gas station. You won't have any problems parking here and there are plenty of tables for those who wish to dine in.  Our combo meal had different brats, schnitzel, spaetzle , two types of sauerkraut and what looked like a german hamburger (Not sure what it's called).   We loved everything. The food was fresh and the staff was friendly. They told us (in a thick german accent) to sit down and get comfortable while we wait for our take-out order. We sipped delicious german beers while  our food was being prepared.  I will definitely be back. This place feels like a jewel in the rough. You don't' expect to find a great german restaurant in a strip mall behind a gas station, but it works and our experience was delightful.",

There's not a whole lot of food choices in the vicinity, so we're always on the lookout for something new.  This trip, one of the local guys says \"hey, there's a new German place that opened.\"  So we went to check it out.  We were greeting promptly by (I assume) one of the owners and then a waitress came up, with her ever so slight German accent telegraphing to me that yes, the food will be good.  Sure enough, it was.  A variety of Schnitzel graced our table, and even the West German burger ordered by one of our less adventurous coworkers looked awesome.  At the end of the meal, the chef came around to see how we liked it.  Then the owner told us about their catering menu, including their amazing strudel.  He brought us an end cut sample of strudel, and it was AMAZING.  If you're in Vegas to party, I don't think you'd make the trek out here, but if you're looking for authentic German food, or if you're local and live or work in the area, definitely check this place out.  The only thing I'd add would be some taps with German beer, but I bet that's in their plans.",

The pretzels were perfect, light and airy great flavor right amount of salt. Then we ordered potato pancakes. They were served with a side of sour cream and apple sauce. Two huge potato pancakes came out, with generous portions of the sour cream and apple sauce. They were delicious. Fried to the right amount of crispy. Honestly the best I have ever had. I ordered the sauerbraten with a side of red cabbage and the cucumber salad. Loved every bit of it. The sauerbraten was fork tender, the spaetzel was divine. The gravy was the correct consistency and tasted fantastic. Two big a portion, took half home. My husband had one of the schnitzels which he loved and he also took half home. My BIL had the rouladen which I tasted and loved. Will order that next time.  The service was outstanding from beginning to end. Everyone there was so kind and engaging.

We have had the rouladen, schnitzel, saurbraten, and sausage, along with the spaezle, red cabbage, and potato dumplings. It's all wonderful. The staff is very friendly, just as the folks were in Germany. We are extremely fortunate to have this restaurant in our city. I hope they do very well here. The only negatives are the location....not facing a main street. It's set back a bit in a small strip of shops. The interior could have a bit more atmosphere, but that won't keep us  away.",

It wasn't bad, pork pounded out, breaded and fried, but the gravy, although it was good was sparse and just mushroom gravy, not a hunter sauce and the mushrooms seemed canned.  The service was not good, not horrible but lacking.  For the price we thought if not a salad we would at least get some bread.  But no, schnitzel and spatzle with a little gravy.  We did take a piece of  strudel home and it was pretty good but the vanilla sauce was awful.  Not sure why this place has such high ratings.  We thought it was overpriced and just passible.",

When I entered the cafe, the employees were very friendly, and were patient with me as a fumbled through the menu. I ordered a draft Paulaner Munich premium beer to drink. To eat I ordered  Jaeger Schnitzel (pork cutlets with mushroom gravy), it's served with a side of fresh Spaetzle. I also ordered one white Bockworst on the side. As I look around the restaurant while waiting for my food, I see many German style decorations that are cool to look at. The music playing is a local \"pop\" station. All the employees have a German accent, which is nice to hear, means they know how to cook some German food, haha! The food was really good... The total bill came to $28 dollars (not including tip). You get a little wrapped German chocolate square with the bill. The only downside to my entire experience was the shopping centers parking is a little crazy.",

I had the Zigeuner schnitzel and they had the regular schnitzels.  I asked for mine with spaetzle, which was not a problem.  I found mine to be very flavorful, with a tasty bell pepper sauce and large pieces of pepper in it.  They were also very happy.  Apple streudel for dessert was also tasty and seemed homemade, which they confirmed.  Overall, the place is a little spartan on the inside, but you can tell they are starting out and I can only imagine the place getting better and more refined as time goes on, if they are successful.  Plenty of other tasty things on the menu I will try later, such as jaegerschnitzel, currywurst, and a variety of other sausages and such.    The $10 off yelp coupon only made it even sweeter...3 lunches with 2 streudels, an iced tea, and tax..$23 + $10 for the cost of the yelp coupon.  Definitely one of the better german meals I have had in town.",

    "text": "We saw this place driving by and decided to check it out based on the review and our desire to have some German food for dinner.   The restaurant is quaint with around 15 tables (some high tops) and a small bar at the front..  The tables are nothing fancy but the decor fits perfect with the name because it definitely gives you the cafe vibe with red table cloth and German decorations adorning the walls.  There's a small display case at the front as well that shows of some delicious strudel (more on that later).  They have a TV which appears to have a cable box but was being used to showcase the different dishes they have while we were there.  While we were there they had live accordion music playing and a sprinkling of Christmas decorations including a tree.  The live music I thought would be a bit overpowering in the space but turned out to be just the right noise level so as to not overpower our conversation.    The menu was just what we were looking for with various schnitzels, sausages, and traditional sides.  They also had a decent offering of German beer which they served in the proper glass by beer style (i went with a hefeweizen).  I went with the Jaeger schnitzel and my wife had the sauerbraten both with spaetzle.  We also split a side of potato salad.  The schnitzel (with pork) was crispy without being greasy and the mushroom gravy was delicious.  The spaetzle was a good side made even better with the gravy mixed in.  The beef in the saurbraten was very tender and the sauce was very tasty, not as good as the mushroom gravy, but a close second.  The potato salad was more of a mustard base than i'm used too (my family makes german potato salad more vinegar based and served warm) but it had a nice flavor just the same.  The staff was very friendly, they sat us relatively quickly and got our order in a timely fashion considering all the tables save a high top was occupied and they had 2 servers.  The food came out pretty fast as well and they kept tabs on our drinks too.  I had a 10% discount which they forgot to apply to the bill but happily provided us a  free plate of apple strudel in trade (which we happily accepted).  The strudel was served warm with some whipped cream and a creamy sauce as well.  They had cherry and blackberry as well which i'm sure are just as tasty.    the only thing that could have been better was the iced tea.  I'm not sure if it was a specific kind or just an off batch, but it was pretty watered down.  Given all the other pluses we'll certainly be there again to find out.    ich bin ein berliner!!",

She had these two inch long fingernails that were a good place for bacteria and cross contamination to breed. After she took our drink order I seen her eating food behind the counter while getting our beverages. ( Hello Clark County Health Department!) After taking our order and all during her idle time while we were there she had more interest either talking to her boyfriend sitting at the counter or using her cell phone. Well we get our food and the order is screwed up. ( I wonder why?). My daughter ordered a salad with grilled chicken and there was no chicken! My wife ordered a side of Spaetzle and it was also missing. The owners of Cafe Berlin better get there heads out of the sand or they will not be open very much longer. I cannot recommend this place to anyone!",

However, once I spotted this place and saw that it was managing to stay open despite a less than stellar location I was intrigued. The reviews on Yelp were positive so I put it on our to do list. My husband lived in Germany for a few years as an Army brat and always raved about the food so he was an easy sell. We finally dined there this past Saturday and it did NOT disappoint! I called dibs on the Jaegar Schnitzel and since we never like to be \"matchy matchy\" in our choices he went with the Wurstplatte to get a taste of their main sausages. Meal wasn't quick to come out but I am pretty forgiving of this at mom-and-pops, especially when the food comes out hot and tasty. Check and check. This is NOT the place for you if you aren't into pork, breading and starches with nary a green in sight.  Also not the place for you if you are looking for lederhosen and atmosphere. This IS the place for you if you are looking for delicious food and pleasant service. Really, truly yummy, and my husband said my Schnitzel had a flavor he had been craving for more than 30 years. (and no, he doesn't say that to ALL the girls...) We are early eaters and arrived around 4:30. At that hour we are very often the sole diners even in super popular places, so we were surprised that a few tables were already occupied. It was positively jumping by 5:30. An accordion player was pumping out oompah and other assorted tunes, which I loved, always having had an inexplicable fondness for the instrument. We will absolutely be back. It's only been 3 days but I'm kinda craving it already.",

    "text": "Ok I don't know where to begin... I guess the beginning. I was brought here with great intentions for a great night with someone who knows German food. That's the best part of the experience!  The place was empty and the server was nice and attentive but not anything special. I had asked for a specific salad dressing and he had told me they don't have it when they did. I had also said no onions and they were still on there.  The iced tea was watered down or something as tasted very bland. There were only pork protein options except one dish. I don't typically eat pork except ribs so I got the one meat dish. The sauerbraten was very fatty meat but the part I did have was good in a nice sauce. The bread we got was skimpy, no rolls like in the picture and it was stale rye bread. His jaeger schnitzel was good as I had a few bites but I liked my sauce better. The spaetzle was also bland but looked like it should have so much more flavor. his beer also came in a liquor glass... Seemed odd but maybe a cultural thing and didnt seem to be the amount of beer stated on menu. The 6-10 bites of food I had was decent hence the two stars. Also if I ate more pork it might have been different... The only other German restaurant I went to at least had chicken options or something. The only chicken had ham with it and the waiter said couldn't make without it as already done.  Now I have a sweet tooth... Apple pie is one of my favorites... However the picture of the strudel didn't seem appetizing as 80% pastry and 20% apple. Oh well saved me the calories. Maybe German isn't my thing, maybe just an off day and I should keep an open mind and give one more try, but with all the restaurants out there I like and that I haven't tried yet, it will not be a rush back.",

    "text": "What an utter FAILURE! Came here for lunch with friends last week and ordered the chicken cordon blue with spaetlze. My friends all got their food first, which was to their liking for the most part (except for one of them not knowing that they put mustard inside of the cordon blue since the menu doesn't state such). Here's where things turn POSSIBLY DEADLY; out comes my cordon blue and i take the first bite and notice that it was luke warm. At first I didn't think anything about it, as I thought that since mine came late it had just been sitting in back waiting on the spaetzle to be cooked. Upon the second bite I immediately spit it out because the entire piece of coated fried chicken was TOTALLY RAW!!! I mean it looked like the filet had just come out of the refrigerator. I was so angry that I immediately brought it to the attention of the  waitress. While they brought me something else to eat for free and didn't charge me for the entree and apologized a few times; this is simply something that can NEVER OCCUR...EVER! While I appreciate their apologies, I had to spend the next 24 hours worrying about my health; as I did fully eat the first piece. Perhaps a better way to serve this dish would be to cook the chicken by itself, then place the ham and cheese on top of the fully cooked fried chicken. This way the chance of reoccurrence will be next to nill, since the chicken being fried is much thinner and does not have the other ingredients stuffed into it. Quite frankly this is the kind of experience that I wish I would have never had. They could have given me a $500. gift card and I would have never accepted it because I would never come back to an establishment for a mistake such as this. Their simply is just no excuse for a mistake of this kind, as this can KILL someone! Sorry for the negativity but other's must know of this, so that they can always be vigilant about checking their food.",

    "text": "Personally, German food is one of my favorite things, like... Ever. I have had German Hasenpeffer listed on my Yelp \"Last Meal On Earth\" since I opened my account! If that's not enough proof, then I don't know what is.  When I went off to college (the first time), I would often go back home to visit my mother in Massachusetts during the summers. Mom knew there were a few traditions I always expected to be upheld in those warm, New England months. The primary being at least one trip over to a restaurant known as The Fort/The Student Prince. There lives the origin and appreciation I have for German food. The interior alone seems to transport you to a restaurant in Freiburg im Breisgau.  Cafe Berlin does not really transport you anyplace at all, but quite honestly, it really doesn't have to. The food is what shines here. Not to trash talk or anything, but I have been to Hofbrauhaus, which one would think would give you that more authentic German experience, but all you seem to get there is boring food, a high bill, and your butt paddled. It ends up becoming more of a tourist experience rather than a German one.  Cafe Berlin delivers the opposite. The interior is pretty \"meh\", and you may not receive a spanking from some waitress dressed up in a dirndl costume, but the food takes you away. I came with Marie T., and we decided on the homemade pretzel with cheese as our starter. The extra dollar gets you this awesome looking cheese with green onion, radish and paprika sprinkled on top, instead of just mustard. I would recommend it.  I also chose the Radler \"bier\". I have had it before, at RX Boiler Room, and really enjoyed it. I was excited to see it on the menu here, as this has been the only other place I have seen it served.  We both settled on the Jager Schnitzel, which we split for two reasons. One, the portions are huge here. The second one being that the prices here are fairly high. The Jager Schnitzel is almost $19 a plate. That is fairly standard pricing, as far as this type of food goes for now. But just as a warning, be expected to spend more than you might initially think. But also know that it's worth it. Our meal was excellent, as well as the service.  They may not have my hasenpeffer, but what they do have here is a man playing the accordion during your meal. For that reason ALONE, you need to get yourself down here!",

    "text": "First of all, I'm German, have lived there most my life and therefore can be extremely bias. I went here for the AYCE buffet on the last Saturday of every month. It was my first time and I was hoping to have a chance to explore their entire (or most of it) during that event. Only to be disappointed with having the average stuff.   schnitzel, it was pan fried for sure. The chef- owner kept refilling the station, literally having fried 5 small prices of Schnitzel in a standard size cast-iron pan. Some of the schnitzel were perfectly cooked, some of them were too brown/crispy/burned on one side.  Sausages, they serve 3 kind during the AYCE buffet, so they were so-so, in my opinion. I love German sausages...they run in my blood, they didn't have the Brotchen (bread) for me to put them in, as you would like back home. The curry sauce was so-so. Not like I remember from my favorite curry wurst stand back home.   Rotkohl was good. I have been looking for a decent brand to by in store, but have not found one like back home. The rot kohl here was close enough to the taste I crave every now and then.  Bouletten (Frikadelle) was ok, a little on the dry side. They kept falling apart when I ate them. Just like the schnitzel, they were either ok, or burned on one side.  Salads were average. I did like the cucumber salad. I wish they would offer some more authentic like Bohnen salat.  They had mini cupcakes and a few assorted cookies for desert, nothing too memorable or German. Mini cupcakes are the ones from costco or walmart you can buy, with the circle sugar sprinkles.  I have to try their regular menu on a regular day, to see what all the good reviews are about. Otherwise the AYCE was a miss for me.   I did like how it was off the strip and away from the hofbrauhaus drinking crowd. I could actually focus on eating rather than  trying to dodge he biersteins.",

The pretzel was good but not the kind I remember having in Germany.  The food was pricey.  Halve the portions and reduce the price. All three of us took half of our plates home.  The service was fair. The server was pleasant enough. The uniform is not \"uniform\" at all. She wore a black tank  top with a glittered brand name across her ample bust. Tattooed arms and her nail were long!  The decor was unlike any German restaurant I have ever been in. The only German touches were a few lithograph prints on the wall.

The Schnitzel was cripsy and the sauce for the currywurst had the right amount of tang and curry. I wish we would have been around to come to the buffet, so I will keep that in mind the next time we are around to visit.",

But still, my friend offered we'll stop by so we went for it.   At first we've ordered coffee and thought about eating at a different spot, but then we figured we should stay and try it out. I've ordered a latte which was mediocre to say the least. Then we went for a green salad which was nice, an okay sized portion, and some sort of pasta and dressing.   We weren't crazy about it, is all I can say. The service was good, I should add. Overall though, this is definitely not my type of place.",

I had Jaegar Schnitzel which was delicious and filling. Their food is authentic and everything was made fresh and homemade. The menu showcast a great selection of schnitzel, brats, and other traditional dishes.  The service was great. The husband and wife (owners) were very nice.  I learned they have a buffet on the first Saturday of each month which would be nice to try out. I believe they also have a rewards program for lunch. In addition,  I want to check out the live music which happens on last Saturday of the month at 5pm.   The price per plate is around $18- $20 but portion is huge and it's definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Good Service, Decent Food, Would Consider Trying Again  This is a popular restaurant and it was busy when we arrived.  My favorite German Restaurant in Vegas was Cafe Heidelberg, but that closed several years ago.  Having traveled extensively through Central Europe and spent a few nights in Germany, I was looking forward enjoying some German food.  I also like the German Bread Bakery on Eastern, so I was also looking forward to the desserts.  In terms of the dishes, they were okay.  My wife ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel.  I thought it was going to taste like the one I remembered from Cafe Heidelberg, but it was a bit more flat, lacked acidity, and had a strong, pleasant buttery taste.  I tried the Wurstplatte.  The sausages were tasty and enjoyable.  I liked that they gave me plenty of sauerkraut and a bottle of brown mustard.    Finally, the we had the home made strudel.  The dish was good, but it was a bit unpleasant because it appeared to have been microwaved.  I would have preferred it warmed in the oven so that the crust would have been crispy.  The creme anglaise was also pleasant (and warmed in the microwave) as was the home made whip cream.    So why 3 stars?  Because it didn't taste better than Cafe Heidelberg or the German Bread Bakery.",

The buffet offers rolls, potato salad, cucumber salad, mashed potatoes, kraut, spaetzle, various types of sausage, chicken, mixed veggies, schnitzel, various gravys and a desert (the desert type changes depending on the night you go).   The price is around $25, but you are allowed a leisurely, no rush meal and can go up as many times as you like. The food is fresh and hot, with everything perfectly cooked. The chefs are constantly bringing out small batches of food.  I've never been to Germany, but most staff seem to be German and there were many people speaking German around us both times so I'm assuming it's pretty authentic. The regular menu has many choices and I'm sure is all fantastic. If the food can taste as good as it does on a buffet,  I'm sure the made to order stuff is perfect too.  If you do go on a buffet night, definitely make a reservation in advance if possible. The place is small and the buffet is really popular. You might have luck if you show up right when they open at 4, but I saw several people get turned away when they didn't have reservations. Last time I went, I was there at 4:05 and the place was already over half full.",

A couple of us tried this option and one person tried the schnitzel. The burger was a flavor explosion! The combination of flavors balanced perfectly. It was delicious. The schnitzel received equally high marks. The only thing I'm upset is that I didn't have room to try the chocolate cake. I'll have to come back.",

We look over the menu, classic German fair (schnitzel, sausage, etc) I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and a side of Red Cabbage. While waiting for my food, (enjoying a Warsteiner Pilnser on tap!!) I took notice to all the decor. The German flags, the US flag and all the Berlin posters was a real nice touch of ambiance. The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child, eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree, I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow, it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. I fully and whole heartily hope this place does well. I will be visiting this place as frequently as I can. I hope everyone gets to have the same experience as I do.",

    "text": "Went there last week with my German Mom.  We (party of 4) all had the Schweine-Schnitzel and it was great!!!!  And of course the strudel was hmmm-mmmm.  Oh, and my husband really loved the warstein beer. We couldn't have asked for better service.  The waiter was great to us and quite the salesman so great for the bottom line, I'm sure. LOL!  A little more than we expected to pay but the portions were huge and again, did I mention my husband loved the beer?  If you get the wine, it's much better to get the bottle than by the glass. We almost didn't go because about a year we tried and they weren't open even though the posted hours said they should be.  But our friends convinced us to try again and we are so very happy we did!    Keep it up!  We'll be back very soon.",

Naturally a nice selection of German beers and wine. The most unusual aspect of this place is the genuine concern that management has in doing its very best. At each course I was asked if every thing was to my liking and the service was superb. Finally, having eaten strudel in Munich and Switzerland I found it to be not as flakey as I remember. This is an establishment that deserves a second visit.",

    "text": "Stopped by here at lunchtime on a Saturday. They open 4p-9p, but the owner was getting into her car & stopped to chat. She mentioned their Saturday night buffet. We decided to try it even tho' we had been at the Hofbrauhaus the night before.   We were glad we returned - food was great!  We got a lot more variety of food, beverages & an apple strudel to share for the same price as the previous night.  The owners checked with us during the meal, refilled non alcoholic beverages & exceeded our expectations. Both were happy to answer questions & converse between assisting other diners.  The 4 Star rating is because there wasn't a 4.5. As some others mentioned, there isn't a lot of ambience other than German music playing (low enough not to interfere with our conversation - a problem the night before at dinner even before the band started playing). If the public can help keep their business going, I expect they will add to their decor. Check in February when they have their 1 year anniversary. Cafe Berlin should not be kept a secret -- it was great --  we plan to return ASAP!  (We live out of town)",

We were hoping the Cafe Berlin would meet expectations for decent German food. We were pleasantly surprised because it EXCEEDED our expectations. My husband ordered the Jaegerschnitzel and I ordered the Rahm Schnitzel. Both were delicious! The schnitzels were a crispy, golden brown on the outside while moist and tender inside. The sauces were full of flavor but not too heavy and the spaetzl...mmmmm...nothing but fresh, buttery goodness. We finished our meal with a cherry streudel that was fabulous! it came with whipped cream and a subtle vanilla sauce that was so tasty I used my spoon to slop up what was left! They have an all you can eat buffet on the first Saturday of every month...needless to say, we plan to go back so we can try EVERYTHING!",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch during the middle of the week. Place seems clean & wide open. First off it seems they don't know how to keep track of what patron comes in ahead of another. As we had another table come in a few minutes after us that they went to 1st to take an order from even though we were waiting to order & eventually had to flag down someone to take our order. Ordered a sausage sandwich with grilled onions & sauerkraut for $8.99. Pretty basic but took forever to come out of the kitchen. When it arrived there was hardly any sauerkraut or onions on the thing. I expected it to be heaping with onions & sauerkraut - if not heaping at least covering all the bread but there was maybe 1/8 cup on the thing. I love sauerkraut & that's why I ordered it. I had highly disappointed. The sausage itself was 2 smaller sausages about the length & girth of an average man's thumb. There was way too much extra bread with the sandwich they really should get smaller buns or larger sausages. Sausage & bread did have good flavor but nothing outstanding to make me want to return to the venue. It was served with regular old French's Yellow Mustard. What? Yes French's Mustard. No awesome German mustard's to be seen or informed of. One would expect a German restaurant to have at least a few German mustard's available. When it came time for the bill we just opted to hit the register rather than wait for our check as it was extremely busy & only 2 waitstaff that seemed like they were not used to a crowded restaurant (Probably only really 1 waitress but owner was trying to help out). I wouldn't go back.",

Bratwurst tasted like a dish soap seasoned with black pepper. (Thank you for that experience) Potatoes had no taste except some weird paprika flavor.  And it was all greasy, and mushy.  Other dish we had was goulash with spatzle and that was bad as well. Meat was dry, literally dry. Like it was cooked in water for hours and then left there to be covered with sauce that was weird (how dare you to call that goulash). Overall,way over priced forwhat they serve you.

    "text": "This place is a great find. Definitely added to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  I was in Vegas for a trade show with a craving for beer and German food. This was also the night of presidential debate #3 so traffic was a mess. I saw the listing for Cafe Berlin and is scored on all 3 needs... good looking menu, decent selection of beer, and nowhere near UNLV traffic closures.  The first thing you will notice upon arrival is the restaurant is hidden back behind an ARCO station in a rather generic looking strip mall. Don't let that put you off.  I was greeted by the friendly staff and offered a choice of tables. I was meeting another couple and went for a traditional bench style table. When my dinner companions arrived they had brought along another friend from the hotel lobby. As soon as they say down the waitress brought out a fourth place setting and menu without missing a beat and without any of us asking. The night was looking good.   From there things only got better. We tried the Jaeger schnitzel, bratwurst, Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst'l, the pretzel with mustard and Obatzter, the Sauerbraten and the homemade apple strudel. Every plate went back empty. The big favorites of the evening were the Sauerbraten (some of the best I've ever had, super tender and moist, marinated for 10 days, cooked to perfection) and the apple strudel (tasted freshly made with big chunks of tender apple, raisins and spices with a soft outer shell)  I will be back on my next visit to Vegas.",

Please note that the bulk of stellar reviews come from people who say they have never had German food prior to this meal.  Brian P. & I came here for our weekly date night on 1/3/15. It was a big surprise for me because Brian knew how much I wanted to try it despite living on the opposite side of town now. We figured the reviews, plus the much hyped once a month buffet would surely be worth the long drive and steep price. We were disappointed.  The best way to describe the food is like this - if you were going over to your German friend's house for dinner but their mom toned the food down to try to appeal to what she thinks is your American tastes. She also decided to use a bunch of premade stuff because she didn't want to waste the good stuff on her kid's school friend.  The buffet included:  *Marinated cucumbers - a bit on the bland side. Not too tangy or seasoned.  *German potato salad - decent but not as tangy or hot (spicy) as I prefer. *Mashed potatoes - fancy looking but tasted like premade potatoes from the grocery store. * Spatzle - Good. Possibly coated in margarine rather than butter. *Sauerkraut - decent. *Rotkhol - decent. *Roasted chicken - very good but just regular roasted chicken. *Peas & Carrots - straight up frozen, from a bag, peas and carrot cubes. Did not try. *Assorted sausages - what types they were was unlisted. Did not enjoy. *Pork Schnitzel - very thin and crispy, but the highlight of the meal. *Frikadellen - reminds me of the hamburgers my parents made when I was young that I hated. Did not enjoy. *Brown gravy - OK *Mushroom gravy - OK, tasted like thickened, canned soup. *Paprika gravy - looks gross because of vegetable bits but tastes delicious. *Assorted packaged mini desserts from the store such as cupcakes and those little doughnuts that come in powdered, waxy chocolate or toasted coconut.  For $22.99 per person, I expect more than prepackaged desserts, frozen vegetable medley and the cheapest items that I have or can make (sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, ground beef patties.) I made spatzel daily as my after school meal in middle school. Parents make better cabbage dishes and cucumber salad at home. For that price and as much hype, I shouldn't say \"if I had to choose, I'd just eat a plate of the sides.\"  While the staff was friendly and the kitchen looked exceptionally clean from the register, for that price, go enjoy AYCE sushi or meat heavy Korean BBQ and save German food for your make-at-home meal.",

The staff was extremely friendly and suggestive since I had no knowledge of it. I ended up ordering the sampler which has a little of everything , it was enough to split between my lady, child and I barely being able to walk and the plate still having some on it. Whether you're an advocate of German food or not you should definitely stop here",

That feeling is turbo charged with the German pop music radio station back ground music playing in the background.  It was a day off so I was more than willing to enjoy a nice frosty glass of Warsteiner Premium Dunkel.  The Dunkel was a delicious larger hailing from Munich.  For my meal I ordered the \"Jaeger Schnitzel.\"  Two breaded pork cutlets topped with what is said to be their \"secret\" gravy containing by favorite fungi, mushrooms.  It was indeed tasty.  The topper was the adorable German hostess, who upon delivering the bill was speaking to me in German.  I tried to fake understanding her but my inability to sprechen gave me away.  There was apparently other German speakers in the restaurant and I was confused as being on of them.",

We got the Jaegerschnitzel which the menu described as \"two tender 'Hunter Style' breaded pork cutlets topped with our secret mushroom gravy and served with fresh house spaetzle.\".  Man oh man was this fantastic.  The cutlets were big and very juicy.  The spaetzle was excellent too.      We also got the \"Wurstplatte\" which was a sausage sampler that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut consisting of two of each of their 3 homemade sausages.  Interestingly enough, my favorite was my wife's least fave.  I really enjoyed the \"bockwurst\" which was their white sausage flavor the best, she preferred the beer bratwurst.  No problem then..more for me!    The apple streudel on display looked damn good so we got one of those too.  I really liked the doughyness of it.    I am holding out on 5 stars til they get a liquor license and I can guzzle some steins of beer with their delicious food.  Anybody out there in Yelpworld got some pull?  The owner said she's been waiting for 9 months already.    They also have a dinner buffet the first Saturday of every month.  Count on us being there Dec 1st!",

    "text": "This was my first experience with German food so take my food comments with a grain of salt.  We pass Cafe Berlin every time we go to International Marketplace and always say we're going to stop by. After a trip to Ding Tea, we decided to finally come in and get dinner to go. When we walked in, we were met with possibly the tannest woman on earth. She asked if we were a party of two and I let her know that we actually wanted to get our food to go. She was visibly annoyed and looked like I'd just asked to borrow money or something. I was just trying to save her from getting out cutlery and such. We were left with one menu to share with zero suggestions from the waitress.   I settled on the schnitzel wiener art with potato salad. Grandma got the bier brats with fried potatoes. While we waited for our food, one of the owners was making himself a cocktail and drinking on the job. Nice. Our food came out in a decent amount of time. When we got home, I was surprised how small a portion our food was. My chicken schnitzel was tiny and mostly all potato salad. Same with grandma's bratwurst. It was one small sausage and enough potatoes to feed three people. My chicken had a weird taste and I actually thought it was fish at first. The potato salad was aggressively mustard and lemon flavored, which I did not like. The German potato salads I've had before were nothing like this. I threw it out. Grandma's potatoes were way too salty and otherwise tasted like nothing, even with the provided gravy. Those went into the trash too. So we paid $30 for a palm-sized piece of chicken and 1 sausage. Cool. Not doing that again.",

Cafe Berlin has a nice variety of my favorite German dishes especially currywurst - a simple, quick, and easy to make dish - which surprises me as to why not all German restaurants in this town have it.  The people that run Cafe Berlin are really German...not 2nd generation, not 8th generation Germans. I like being left alone instead of being asked 100 times if everything is ok. So, to me, service was great.   They have wurst, pretzel, schnitzel, spaetzle, potato pancakes, strudel, Black Forest cake, etc. I stuck with my favorites:  Pretzel: With Obatzter (Bavarian cheese with paprika), and real mustard for dipping. Huge, hot, and real pretzel (not the commercialized disappointing Auntie Anne's kind). 4/5  Currywurst: I love love love this. Sausage swimming in curry ketchup and generous dusting of curry powder. Comes with a side of fries. You have two size options: regular or large. I opted for the regular which was great so I could try another dish. 5/5  Schnitzel Wiener Art: Breaded and fried pork cutlet. Comes with a side of German potato salad but I added spaetzel on the side. Tender and juicy pork. Comes in regular or large. 4/5  I unfortunately did not have room for dessert. I'll be sure to try some on my next visit.",

The menu had a variety of bratwursts, burgers, and german themed food. I ended up getting the Bratwurst burger with a fresh warm pretzel as a appetizer. It was delish!

After leaving a play at UNLV, I knew they'd be open because on Saturday and Sunday they open an hour earlier, at 4 PM.    The tables seat six people for the most part so it's not a place for a solo diner in that respect.  The person seating me looked at me and asked if the bar was OK.  It was fine with me so that's where I sat.  I looked through the menu and opted for jaeger schnitzel.  I wondered about appetizers and whether they were shareable size or for one person.  When my server said the onion cheese twists were OK for one person, I ordered that for a starter.  The house made puff pastry was light but there wasn't a flavor of much cheese or onion.  The twists were accompanied by some sliced red and green bell pepper and some cream cheese.  When I ordered, I was going to ask about the \"regular\" and \"large\" portions listed on the menu.  When I ordered she asked me if I wanted lunch or dinner order.  I said dinner and that's the large.  Oh well, suck it up mister and finish your plate or you can't leave the bar until you do (my mother came out in the review!)  It consisted of two large pork cutlets, breaded, and fried to a perfect crispness.  It was topped my their \"secret\" mushroom gravy.  There was also house made spaetzle.    The schnitzel was very good and the mushroom gravy helped make the dish enjoyable.  This spaetzle was very good--not like the pieces you get in some frozen vegetables.  For dessert, I took my server's suggestion and went with the apple strudel accompanied with a vanilla suace.  The strudel was good.  next time, I'll do the Black Forest cake.  A place that I'll have to return and try something different than schnitzel which I've had in the past.",

Things I liked:  - appetizer sampler: there were, pretzel, twisters and potato pancakes in the sampler and served with few condiments; there were a cheese onion dip, Obatzter, sour cream and applesauce. The pretzel was good, chewy outside and soft inside, the twisters were light and fluffy and the cheese inside gave it a nice flavor. And the pancake was solid. -Jaeger Schnitzel: the pork cutlet was crispy and light not greasy at all. The gravy was delicious with nice mushroom flavor. And i really enjoyed the spaetzle, the egg noodle had a great texture to it, very firm and a little chewy.  Overall very satisfied lunch. Good delicious and  comfort food.",

    "text": "Cafe Berlin makes delicious Spaetzle! I finally was able to stop for a visit after having driven by this area numerous times on different occasion. When I walked inside the restaurant, Romona is very welcoming and had a menu ready. I already knew what to order and started with a Fresh Brewed Iced Tea ($2.79). It's a good thing this beverage has a free refill, it's served cold and refreshing with any given meal. They also serve German, American, and Non-alcoholic Beer, White Wine, and Red Wine.  My first order are Potato Pancakes ($6.99). It's delivered as two homemade hashbrown style flat pancakes accompanied with sour cream and applesauce. These potato pancakes are prepared light, crispy thin, and it's so tasty when it's dipped in that thick sour cream. The sweet applesauce is good too, but I feel sour cream is a better complement to potato.  For the main dish, I chose Jaeger Schnitzel ($12.99) which is one of their most requested German food. They give you an option to have it made with pork or chicken. My personal go-to is always chicken. It's a \"hunter style\" breaded cutlet topped with a savory mushroom gravy and served with fresh housemade Spaetzle. Unlike chicken katsu where there is more tender meat and crispy breading, this particular chicken cutlet is prepared slightly thin with a light batter, but the mushroom gravy makes up for it by lavishing the meat with good flavor. I especially love the housemade Spaetzle mixed with fresh parsley. It kind of reminds me of a skinny udon noodle that is made al dente. The food is yummy and they make everything fresh from scratch. They also serve sandwiches, burger and salads, there are a few vegetarian options, and they have a kids menu too.   For dessert, I just had to try their Black Forest Cake ($7.50). It's four layers of chocolate cake with cherries and whipped cream in between, topped with chocolate shavings and a cherry fruit. This cake taste amazing and it's super moist! The whipped cream is so light and airy, the chocolate has the perfect sweetness to it, and it taste delicious as how it should be. I asked if they make the cake fresh daily. Finding out they make the cake every two days, which makes me wonder if I was given the fresh cake or a two day cake.   Now here's the best part, they have a German Buffet every first Saturday of the month from 4pm to 9pm. It's All You Can Eat German food with soda and desserts included. However, there's an exception. If you're eager to try potato pancakes, I was told you might not see it available at the buffet and there may be a few other German food missing too, but you can always call and ask to see what they do offer.    Overall, I feel the service is good. Romona has been very kind, personable, and attentive. She let me know which food will be delivered first and even made time to teach me how to say a few German phrase like \"hello\" and \"thank you.\" Also, instead of getting just an empty cup to pour what's left of my iced tea to take home, Romona was real sweet and offered me a full cup of fresh brewed iced tea which I truly appreciate!  Cafe Berlin is a great place for authentic German food. It's right on the corner of Sunset and Decatur. You'll see an Arco gas station nearby and it's in the Sunset Commons Plaza. Now there's not a whole lot of parking, because they have fenced some areas for construction work. It can feel a little congested and frustrating finding parking space. Hopefully there is a remedy for that soon.",

    "text": "Wunderbar!   Ausgezeichnet!    Having grown up in Munich, Germany I know me some good schnitzel and spaetzli.  Cafe Berlin has both and more!  It's tucked away in a small strip mall, and they do close kind of early (8pm except Saturday at 9pm).  Inside, however, you will find some very cool modern/industrial decor with lots of excellent photos of the Berlin skyline.  Staff seemed very friendly, and our server spoke German (and was from Berlin herself).  The menu is replete with German classics - schnitzel, rouladen, bratwurst, etc.  They have so many different kind of schnitzels alone!  Plain, with mushroom sauce, with cream sauce, chicken, pork, etc.   We started with a sampler platter with a wonderful German pretzel (I felt like I was back at Oktoberfest), potato pancakes, and interesting fried onion/cheese rolls which I had never tried before.  Excellent!  I then tried the schnitzel \"Weiner Art\" which is your basic schnitzel without adornments or sauce.  Schnitzel is a thin piece of chicken or pork (your choice) which is breaded and fried.  They have a regular (one piece) or large (two pieces) portion available.  The regular was plenty for me.  I swapped out the potato salad for their awesome pan fried potatoes.  The schnitzel was perfectly tender and crispy - just like back in Munich.  The potatoes were wonderfully crispy and flavorful.  Awesome all around!  They have a great variety of classic German sides including French fries (pommes frites), German potato salad, fried potatoes, and spaetzli.    Leave room for dessert... We tried their German Chocolate Cake as well as both Apple (\"Apfel\") and Blueberry strudels.  Amazing!  Incredibly moist cake, and the strudels had perfect thin dough surrounding plump fruit deliciousness.  German food is not for everyone; it is classically a meat and potatoes affair without too much seasoning and fanfare.  Cafe Berlin does it amazingly well!",

They had a full house, but no excuse for not acknowledging us. Then we had to wait another 15 minutes before they decided to find a table for us. Finally someone left and we just sat at that table. They came and cleaned it then walked away without giving us menus. We had to get up and get them ourselves. Normally, I'd have walked out, but it was late and we were starving. Plus, I had heard that the food was really good. And it was. But the service might make me think twice about dining there there again. In this town, there is no excuse for bad service.",

    "text": "Since we've been wanting German food for awhile, we settled upon Cafe Berlin.   When we arrived it took 5 minutes to seat us. The restaurant had customers, but didn't look busy. When we were finally seated, we were given menus...and that's about it.  We sat there for 10 minutes and were essentially forgotten. We perused the menu and listened to other people's conversations. No water, no drink orders, nothing letting us know they knew we were there. When a sufficient time passed, we got up and left. We counted at least 3 \"servers\" who could have spoken to us as we were there or leaving but didn't. Further, I left my phone behind and my wife went in 5 minutes later to retrieve it...not one person said anything to her (although she did say some patrons looked at her apologetically).  Assomeone who has worked in restaurants, both front and back of the house, this was a huge fail on several levels. Further, this was the most negative \"dining experience\" we've ever had since we've been coming to or lived in Las Vegas. It's truly sad, because after reading many 4+ star reviews on multiple sites, we were very much looking forward to eating here.  One last thing: We went next door to another restaurant to eat. The server who seated us was outside smoking, saw us, and obviously recognized us. Not one word was said. Needless to say, you don't get a second chance to make a first impression.",

    "text": "So, this is about the 3rd or 4th time dining at this restaurant, the food quality stayed consistent, however, the quality of service downgraded almost to a point where despite how good the food is, I refuse to come back here just to deal with super unfriendly and slow as molasses service.  The positives: The food is delicious and authentic. I had the jagerschnitzel and my mother had the wurstplatte. The potato pancakes are super yummy and the cucumber salad is light and full of flavor.  The negatives: The ambience does not match the price point of the food. For a $20 platter of jagerschniztel, I expected to be sat on something a bit more comfortable than the cheapest/most basic ass restaurant chairs with a flimsy ass plastic picnic  table cloth and lackluster decor. I felt like I was dining at a corner pizzeria.   The service is absolutely atrocious, and this is coming from the actual owner herself! My mother is native German and was extremely excited to finally have some good home style cuisine along with friendly conversation from a fellow native (i.e. the owner). She thought wrong. The owner had zero personality and zero interest in wanting to strike up any friendly conversation whatsoever. Even when speaking in German, she wasn't having any of it. Aside from her dull personality, she is slow as molasses, doesn't anticipate the customers needs and could give 2 sh*ts whether or not you return to her restaurant or not.   This last (and final) visit my mother and I had was enough to put a bad taste in our mouths forever. We initially had a young gentleman as our waiter who was very friendly and quick. After our appetizers we're served, we hadn't seen any sight of him for about 30 mins. Another women (the owner) then delivered our entrees without asking if we needed any refills or anything whatsoever. Another 30 mins passes and we assume the original waiter had left. We finally had to wave the owner down to get refills and ask if our waiter had left because we were never checked on. She replied \"Yes\" and walked away without any apology whatsoever or if we wanted any dessert (which we originally wanted but decided it would probably take another hour for her to even bring it to us.) Another long period of time passes again before we literally need to flag the owner down again for our check.   No apologies for poor service, no offers for anything else and nothing but a sour ass personality. We are never coming back to this place again.",

We were one of the first people in and we were seated basically where we wanted to sit, the server was a very nice man but I didnt catch his name...  So, The die allowed all 3 of us to try drinks, however, My ex had to get a diet coke as chosen by the die and our friend had to try a raspberry Iced tea, I was told I could try whatever drink I wished and I tried SPEZI which I was told is coke, orange and lemon basically and it was delicious!  Kind of like a Graveyard which is root beer and orange mixed together, also a good thing to try if you have the chance.    So our friend ordered a delicious pretzel with cheese sauce, didnt care for that part but she loved it so that is what matters and My ex and I both tried potato pancakes which comes with sour cream and apple sauce, He liked them, I didnt.  He ordered a pork cutlet and she ordered a chicken cutlet I believe--The potato salad that came with his order was amazing, it had a tangy mustard or vinegar type taste to it and I would order that again...  I had Rahm Pork cutlet w/ oh gosh what did I order?    Bread stuffing ball but I cant remember what it was called, breaddumpling?    + fried potatoes on the side and I loved both!     I also got Spatzle (sp) with my meal and I didnt like that at all but listen I have never had German food so I am super glad I had a chance to try all of this food, our friend had a wonderful time and Id try it again, just would try the sausages next time?       Oh and dessert, friend ordered an apple strudel which comes with this vanilla sauce that is TO DIE FOR....and we ordered black forest cake, My ex loved his but I wasnt a fan...",

After Cafe Heidelberg shut down, we were worried about finding authentic German cuisine in Vegas, but Cafe Berlin delivers. The decor is bare bones at this point, but the schnitzel is divine and the fresh pretzels are superb! So far, we've tried the jaegerschnitzel and the rahmschnitzel- perfection on a plate. Definitely go!",

The Mushroom sauce on the Jaegerschnitzel was bland and tasted like it came out of a package. And on every street corner in Berlin you get a better Currywurst than was served here. Service was friendly but slow. The place has absolutely no atmosphere, located in a strip mall and it looked like just took some fast food place and call it a German Cafe. Prices were out of proportion with the quality of the food.",

Perhaps I am being harsh, but when youre running a small family owned restaurant and not a KFC and pride yourself on \"authentic\" flavor of a particular country, serving Uncle Ben potatoes just doesnt seem right, especially when you charge over $3 for it as a side.",

Cafe Berlin is a German Deli and at first  wasn't sure if I was going to like German food....turns out I do!!  I had the Beer Brat Sandwich...delish! Sausges are made on site by the Chef and they were so good, we plan on ordering several for a St. Patty's day party we are having.  I can't stop raving about the sausages....so so good!!  Mom ordered the Rahm Schnitzel...she loved it!   My brother tried one of their Burgers, it was real good size for the price. No way I would have been able to eat one by myself.  He is looking forward to trying the other Burgers on the menu!  At the end, we were offered Poppy Seed Strudel....also tasty!   They have a German waitress, which was so awesome..as we noticed other German/Europeans in the restaurant.  It was a piece of home brought to Vegas. They seemed to love it!   The also have Deli Meats available for take out. We took some for the road and had sandwiches later, have to say it was so much better than the local market deli meats.  Ask them about their smoked meats to go!  Staff was very nice and the service was quick.  You gotta check this place out!!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went here because my fiance is from Germany, the place was very cute and cozy, we sat right away our waitress was really nice and helpful and totally on point. The food was really good, prolly the best German food and most authentic in Las Vegas. My fiance said it was very comforting knowing he can get a piece of back home here in Vegas, and it's so close to our house I have no idea why we are just now finding them lol. A friend was visiting from out of town so we decided to give it a try. Food was very flavorful and we enjoyed every bite. We ate until we could eat no more.  Only thing we had a issue with was its a bit pricy especially for what it is. Generally schnitzel is supposed to be veal and it's pork. Kinda strange. I understand paying a bit more for veal cause hello it's veal but $20 for breaded pork with gravy and spatzle (pasta type noodle). Don't get me wrong flavors were great just a bit much price wise I think. Between 3 dishes a pretzel and 2 beers for my fiance, it came to $90+ we will be going again, not as often as we would like because of price, but just be prepared to spend some $. Oh and another plus is this is the only place out here that carries my fiance favorite beer from Germany on tap. He was so excited!  thanks for a good tasty meal Cafe Berlin",

I found a local Mexican place to try, but when I got there, I spotted Cafe Berlin next door and my curiosity was piqued! The inside of the cafe is spacious and airy which was great since it was 102 degrees outside. I was seated quickly and started with a homemade pretzel and mustard. Delicious! The pretzel was big and hot and the mustard had a good kick to it. For my entree, I got the Jaegar Schnitzel which was two big pork cutlets with spaetzle and mushroom gravy. It was superb and the portion was so big, I had enough to take home for a midnight snack after a night out on the town. The nice thing about the food was that it was filling, but didn't slow me down at all like some heavy food. Both my waitresses were super friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who's a fan of German food or just wants to try somewhere different for a change.",

Cafe Berlin is truly authentic German food, which is very hard to find. I have been there three times in the last few months and have tried the Jaegar schnitzel, Zigeuner schnitzel and the Bier Brat sandwich. All of them are amazing. My favorite was the Zigeuner with the red pepper sauce. Can't wait to go back!",

Wasn't setting hopes too high for an authentic German restaurant in Vegas, but happily was proved wrong.  Four of us had lunch.  Vienerschnitzel, jaegerschnitzel and rahmschnitzel were all very good...spaetzle (sp) was also very good.  Vienerschitzel came with German potato salad (served cold) and the flavor was like the traditional stuff I remember.  Jaeger and Rahm sauces were very good.  They now have three bottled German biers and some German wine selections available.  Service was very good.  My wish list for the menu includes:  bier vom fass, salat mit dill, brotchen, sauerbraten and the broasted chicken like they serve at Bad Durkeim/Octoberfest.  We'll definitely return.",

Upon first walking in I realized that the place was small and sparsely decorated, which did not bother me in the least.  When I go to a restaurant my main concern is quality of food first and cleanliness second, this place delivered on both accounts. We went with friends and everyone was very pleased with their meals.  I had a  Jaeger schnitzel with brown mushroom gravy and spaetzle, which was not only a generous portion but very flavorful.  The rest of our party had schnitzels and sausage, all of which they were very pleased with.  We tried the apple streudel for desert, which the waitress said was made in house and it was very tasty.  This place is just starting out, but they are focusing on turning out good food and that is all I am really concerned with. Overall we were very pleased and can't wait to go back for more.",

The food here tasted like frozen food... The fries were pretty much awful since they were like scraps, no more than an inch long... Is that authentic German fries..? maybe but just tasted like frozen french fries to me. My husband got the something cordon bleu chicken and that was blah. Only flavor to that was from the dry ham baked in. The breading on it tasted fishy. I got the braustburger. Not much to say about that, didnt taste much different from a regular burger. I will say it tastes worse when your burping it up a few hours later.... UGHH! I wouldnt be surprised if you go into their kitchen and their freezer is filled with everything they serve. The waitress was nice very soft spoken. Service was good, but we were the only ones in there at 5 in the afternoon so i suppose it should be... Decent prices but not for that food. I dont mind spending thirty bucks at a cafe/resturaunt but when the food is no good it just hurts me. I wanted to send it back after the second bite and leave... but that would have been rude.",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time last night, and was not disappointed.  It is a small \"hole in the wall\" place between an AM/PM and an insurance office, and fairly small inside. Yet there is still plenty of room to dine. There were a fair amount of people present for our visit, but it never felt \"crowded\" either. The photos of Berlin landscapes on the wall are a nice touch, as are the two clocks, one showing the time for Vegas, the other showing time for Berlin.  The server that waited on mom and I had a pretty thick German accent and was quite attentive, doing a good job the whole time. I never had any issues with anyone that waited on us or helped us.  For appetizers, we ordered the pretzel and the potato pancakes. The pretzel was delicious, with a cheese/onion dip, and the potato pancakes had plenty of flavor as well. This was an excellent way to start the evening.  For entree, we split the Jaeger Schnitzel, covered in a delicious, rich mushroom gravy. This was to die for, and the noodles on the side were the perfect extra touch.  I always love getting out and experiencing diverse dining options around Vegas, and this is one of the better discoveries of recent years. Highly recommended!",

When you come in there a sign says wait to be seated, the owner was standing at the bar reading a magazine looked at us and without a smile looked back in her magazine. (that was the moment well we should have left) We got past (while still waiting to be seated)  from the German family that just took a seat somewhere, like  those roads don't count for us lol. Then finally a waitress came and greeted us and we ordered a Jager schnitzel with Spaetzle. I don't not lie when I say that that the badest  food  I ever had in my life.  The Spaetzle where from the days before, do you know how old noodles taste when you warm them up the other day? And the meat was some kind of frozen two pieces of meat, what they  heated up in a pan! But never a hand breaded Schnitzel from a butcher! Omg we were so disappointed. It is a shame calling this German food. Overpriced and bad food and poor service. Never never again!  PS while we were eating the owner was standing the whole time at the bar reading in her magazine and from time to time looking down on her guests  without smiling or anything nicely or kind reaction. Disturbing!",

    "text": "I only know of  two German restaurants in town (unless, Yelp's holding out on me!): Cafe Berlin and Hofbrauhaus (HB). The latter is a \"replica\" of the original in Munich. Their food is good -- though, incomparable to what's served at the HB in Munich --  but I don't consider it to be the best in town.   What I like about Cafe Berlin is the quality of the food. On my first visit, I really enjoyed the Currywurst I ordered, but their Jagerschnitzel was what finally made me give them 5-Stars. It's difficult to dislike their Jagerschnitzel: breaded pork cutlet, creamy mushroom sauce, and tender Spatzle; it's mouthwatering! Unlike HB's, the breaded pork cutlet wasn't tough. Everything about it was awesome.  If any room is left in your belly, I'd suggest giving the apple strudel a try. It's a good finale to a hearty, German meal. Perfect for sharing if you're already feeling a little stuffed, and it isn't overly sweet.   The restaurant isn't as spartan as when it first opened, and they now play German radio stations. Service here is attentive, but keep in mind that the food's not going to arrive on your table right after you place an order. They do take their time here preparing meals.  I much prefer coming to Cafe Berlin for some delicious German food than HB. Although the atmosphere isn't rowdy and raunchy like HB, and there are fewer items on the menu, the food I've had at Cafe Berlin is terrific.",

The parking was convenient.  Inside of Cafe Berlin Around 7:00 pm. When I got into the restaurant, there is a bar on the right hand side which serves German beers and other alcohol for customers. The whole restaurant filled with the smell of delicious foods which makes me feel great appetite. The restaurant decorated in a German style. There are both of German and American flag on the wall. The background color of the restaurant are red, yellow, and black which as same as German flag color. The TV on the wall had pictures of the German food in the menu.  Environment The floors were very clean and the tables were tidy. The temperature of the restaurant was  decent. In the restroom, the lighting was bright; the floors and counters were aggressively clean. The only downside was I did not see any toilet seat paper cover in the restroom.  Service The service was very good and friendly. The waitress introduced all commend foods on the menu, answered the questions with patient and they served food so fast.  Foods Bratwurst: Appearance: Grilled, outside is crispy. Taste: Juicy and salty. Aroma: Grilled and smokey. Flavor: Strong. Texture: Solid.  Comment: It tasted great with mustard.

B) Man kann gutes Deutsches lieblings essen kriegen, gutes Pils vom fass, im ein Gasthaus oder Imbiss mode.  Es gibt kein negativen hier, ausser den preis dort wird ziemlich teuer. Aber bei mir, das macht nichts weil ich glaube dieses restaurant ist der extra premium hoch-wert. Wir koennen der ganze nacht lang darueber preis discutieren aber den geschicht ist nicht moebiliert: der preis ist der preis.  Nun, es klingt wie liebe im hertz das menu: Wuerstchen und schnitzel nach jedem art, pommes oder kartoffel oder paniertes spaetzle oder alles da zu, man findet hier her der ganze erlebniss. Stamm essen und Deutsches lebensmittel und echtes fleischkaese bei den pfund zum mit nehmen.  Ich koente der Disco die ganze nacht tanzen damit solche gutes essen! Und vielleicht ich mach das! Vergiss nicht einmal pro monat es gibt Buffet auch!",

I've eaten here a few times and have absolutely no complaints (other than the fact that they are no longer offering a few items that look very tasty). The staff is friendly, courteous, and accommodating. As far as the food, I can personally vouch for, and heartily recommend, the Bier Bratwurst and the Wiener- and Zigeunerschnitzel (pan friend pork cutlets, the latter served with sauteed peppers and onions). The Currywurst (bratwurst served with a curry ketchup) tastes just like it did from the street vendors of Mainz when I lived there and having it again brought back memories of stumbling into the late-Imbiss for one with Pommes after being shooed out of some Kneipe at 3.00 in the morning.   And always get the strudel...it's made fresh daily and it's delicious.  As far as the decor goes, it is a little spartan at the time of this writing. But one gets the impression when eating there that it is a work in progress and they are slowly putting together the restaurant a little at a time. When they do get all the pieces in place, their liquor license comes through, and the taps installed, Cafe Berlin (already a great spot) is going to be a real neighborhood gem.   I've already got this place set aside as my World Cup 2014 home!",

The spaetzle that accompanIed each was very good. The portions are very generous. (We were there for dinner.). The jager schnitzel had 2 cutlets in a fabulous mushroom gravy sauce. The meat was cooked perfectly with a nice crunchy breading , and wasn't overcooked or tough! Yay! We finished dinner by sharing a piece of cherry strudel. It was served with whipped cream, which was perfectly made with soft peaks and not overly sweetened, and a vanilla sauce.  All in all, really good and was a great dinner choice!",

We ordered wine, appetizers and entrees at the same time from the waitress. Our wine arrived. Our appetizers arrived. And then nothing.  We literally sat at the table for an hour after our appetizers arrived, waiting for our food. It took an hour for someone to come over and ask if we had received our food yet. He returned a minute later asking what we had ordered.  I get that stuff happens and that no restaurant is perfect, but no one had come to check on us in an hour, and the other tables were given plenty of attention. We watched entrees being served to people who arrived waaaaay after us.   The owner tried to blame our server, which in my book (as a 7-year hospitality industry veteran) is a terrible thing to do. You run the place; in the end, it's your responsibility. We asked for the check for our wine and appetizers, left and got takeout from somewhere else.  It was a really disappointing evening, and I'm bummed that the situation was handled so poorly. We definitely won't be back.",

A previous reviewer mentioned Kantine.  I see his point - the food is all very good, but comparable food in Germany can be found in lower-end restaurants.  3.  The portions were rather small compared to German portions.  Think kleine schnitzel.  Therefore, the price seemed a bit on the high side.  4.  The waiters (owners) were super friendly though.  And they serve Paulaner ($6.95 for a half-liter).  You can even get Eine Mass size.  5.  The best food in Berlin isn't German (Turkish).  This place reminded me more of Bavarian food (spaetzle, weisswurst, the beer), which is a good thing (not sure what the Berlin connection is).  6.  They have specials depending on the day of the week.  Saturday is schweinhaxe (dang it, I came on Friday).  They also have a buffet one day a week and the waiter admitted that lunch is busier than dinner.  Located in a strip mall off of Decatur.  7.  I checked in on Yelp, and a 10% discount popped up for dinner for two.  I asked if this applied to my lunch for five, but he said nein.    8.  I miss Germany.",

We've both never had German cuisine before and decided to push our boundaries a little.   The place was pretty simple with really chill staff who let us choose our own seats. Without a standard to set my observations on, I can't quite tell whether all casual German restaurants are decorated this way but it lacked that foreign vibe I expected to get from a supposedly authentic European restaurant. The 3 stars is not based on that because I don't want my ignorance on the culture to affect how people perceive how the restaurant really is.  My rating has more to do with the food than with the vibe alone. I ordered a Schweine Schnitzel \"Wiener Art\" which consisted of two large servings of flattened, breaded pork served with a side of German potato salad. While it tasted pretty good (and boy was the serving huge), I wouldn't say it was exceptional enough for me to go out of my way just to come back. Of course, I will not base conclusions on the rest of the menu after trying only one dish and still plan to try out the strudels, bratwursts and sauerkraut one day.   Location is pretty far down southeast, quite a drive from the strip, in a dark complex fronted by a gas station. Hard to find if someone is not purposely going here. Still, I had a pleasant time and learnt some interesting German words along the way. Now to try and pronounce them!",

I was amazed when I tried the pork wiener schnitzel for the first time. This is my favorite German dish. The crust was perfectly crisp and golden. The meat was sauteed just right. The flavor of lemon juice is all you need to make it perfect! I ordered the spaetzle as well and it was delicious. The appetizer pretzel is just what you expect. It is hot out of the oven, soft, and salty. A very good pretzel combo with the German mustard. You must try the homemade black forest cake. This cake is super moist and they infuse cherry juice into the whipped cream. This dessert is incredible.   The only negative things I can say is the service can be really good and sometimes it can be slow. It just depends. Also my sister always gets the snitzel sandwich. Sometimes it comes out with a different bread type. You never know what bread it will be. Some days it's on a plate and other times it's in a basket. It should be uniform every time.  I have been a loyal customer for the past year and I eat there once a week. I am so happy that this place is here in Las Vegas.  I recommend it to all my family and friends.",

One flaw of the buffet is the line containing the lids for the containers. It severely slows down the line. They should probably get some of the containers with the lid that slides up so the guests don't have to constantly play musical chairs with the lids.   Overall, great food.",

    "text": "This review is a bit overdue as I have been here twice. Lets just begin by saying that this is THE BEST German food in town. Coming back from vacation in Germany with my girlfriend, we immediately craved German cuisine (didn't really feel like going back immediately to American food). The first time around I had the bier brat plate and my girlfriend had the normal brat. We also got a pretzel with cheese and mustard as an appetizer (recommended). Second time around was just as great. Decided to go with the Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst'l (A different thinner brat over mashed potatoes and sauerkraut) which did not disappoint. Very Filling if I must say. I recommend having a good German beer to pair with your plate. Particularly a Paulaner Hefeweizen if you're into that style. It sounds stereotypical but Germany truly does have some of the best selection of beers.  All dishes were delicious, the food tasted the same as back in Germany and the portions are large so the extra $$ you spend is worth it.  The service isn't bad, usually there's about 2 servers for the size of the place. All of them were nice and will check on you periodically. Nothing crazy spectacular but they also get the job done in what's needed.   They do tell you right off the bat that their food is authentic and made fresh to order so there will be a just a tad of a wait. So at least they set expectations. I don't see the point in some of these reviews on yelp to where the server clearly told the customer that there will be a wait but yet the customer still complained about it in a review. No sense there, Id rather have good authentic food than a quick inefficient dinner.  If you're into German food, beer or trying other cultures cuisine, skip the \"touristy\"  Hofbrauhaus and come here.",

    "text": "Earlier this year, we fell for currywurst, the ultimate street food, at a fantastic place in Hollywood called Berlin Currywurst. It left us wishful for a comparable place near home.   I heard about Cafe Berlin on the west side near Decatur/215. We recently stopped in for dinner. We were warmly greeted and led to a table for two. My husband had currywurst with potato salad and I could resist the comfort of Jagerschnitzel and spaetzle. Food was served timely. The currywurst wasn't appealing to the eye, but I couldn't wait to dig into the schnitzel.   The schnitzel was delicious. Better then Cafe Heidelberg and world's better than Hofbrauhaus. Tender pork, crisp breading, creamy mushroom sauce. It could've only been better washed down with a full stein. Hopefully, they'll get their liquor license soon.  Now, the currywurst, on the other hand, wasn't up to par. The sauce itself was quite good, but the sausage? It was terribly fatty. The texture was very unpleasant. After a few bites we could eat no more. Fortunately, the schnitzel was enough for two.   We were a bit bummed we came up empty on the currywurst, but it was nice to find a well prepared schnitzel.",

I love vegas and it's amazing food scene but how did this place get here (and how does it not have thousands upon thousands of reviews??). Tucked away on the corner of Sunset and Decatur, I'd have never found this place without my handy yelp (and googlemap) app.  But the food is so good. I guess they've been around for a while now, which says something about the food in and of itself since vegas has such high turnover for restaurants.  Anyway, to business..   Came here on a random weekday with my uncle. Dinner menu is pretty extensive and we stuck with the classics: potato pancakes to start, jaeger schnitzel with spaetzle (on the recommendation of our super sweet waitress) and the bier brat. All phenomenal. I wouldn't be able to tell you which I liked more.. they were both so good! Ask for recommendations if you're not sure what will suit your palette. They won't steer you wrong!  This place is a bit pricey but the food is top notch and definitely worth a try. The ambiance is also very cute. \"Instagram-y\" if that's a thing. Check out the yelp photos for some pretty cool shots (by other people, not me :D).",

Pretzel appetizer- nicely salted, outer was a little done for my taste with a soft center. Mustard dipper.   I ordered the Wiener Art. I was disappointed in the size of the schnitzel (about the size of a woman's hand) but the taste was nice, mostly buttery and a nice breaded taste. The breaded crunch was golden and on the thinner side. The schnitzel itself was about a quarter inch thick. The cold potato salad was a hit at our table, you're given a pretty good heaping of it.   My husband ordered the Curry Worst which was fantastic! I really enjoyed the curry sauce, not spicy. This dish came with half the plate of thin cut fries, perfectly cooked and drained.   We ordered the Black Forrest cake for dessert, it was really moist and delicious. This is a chocolate cake layered with strawberries and whipped cream. They don't skimp on the whipped cream!",

My father lived in Germany and always likes an edible reminder of his time there. Cafe Berlin is a wonderful treasure! We ordered the Rouladen which came with dumplings and red cabbage. Yummy! We also had two orders of the Jaeger Schnitzel which were gobbled up and the cherry strudel and apple strudel for dessert! We ended up taking some home as the portions were plentiful. My father said everything tasted great to him and enjoyed it very much.   Unbeknownst to me, my father, as he was speaking to our server (perhaps one of the owners?) in German, told her it was my birthday. It was a total surprise to me when she brought me out a special birthday strudel!  They also offer a 10% off two meals, which we were able to use. Thank you for the great evening!",

My boyfriend and I have been looking for a place that offers such food so when his boss suggested Cafe Berlin, we had to give it a try. I was absolutely blown away by the authenticity of the food here. You can hear the cooks speaking German in the kitchen and I was able to hold conversation in German  with our waitress who is also from Berlin.   I ordered the Sauerbraten and I can honestly say (having eaten that very same dish in Berlin only 2 weeks prior to coming here) that it was the BEST Sauerbraten I have ever had in my life. It was tender, slightly zesty, and bursting with rich flavor. I felt downright emotional while eating my food here and when I thought it couldn't get any better, our really sweet waitress (I wish I could remember her name!) gave us her own homemade Apfelstrudel to go with vanilla dipping sauce.   Needless to say, we will be returning to this establishment very soon.",

When I called the order in I was told it'd be 20 minutes, but it was ready to go when I arrived 15 minutes later. The inside of the restaurant was simple and not very big. I'm glad that I decided on take out.   I enjoyed the lunch portion of the Schweine Schnitzel which came with a cold German potato salad. I loved the taste of the dish. The schnitzel was simple and the breading was delicious. The breading was the perfect amount and not greasy. The potato salad had a serious tang that I enjoyed. If I returned I would probably add a side of spaetzle or red cabbage to make it a heartier meal. The meal wasn't enough food to fill me which is very odd for a restaurant portion. My only critique is that the price ($11.99) seemed a bit high for portion as well. I loved the food though.",

    "text": "I'm half German and I miss the food my family used to make- but the seriously mixed reviews kept me from trying this spot sooner. It was decent, but rather than knocking out my German cravings it just made me wish we had more options in town.  I had the pork Jaeger schnitzel lunch plate ($13) with \"hunters style\" mushroom gravy and spaetzle- the pork was a generous portion, nicely crispy, and the mushroom gravy was okay, had few actual mushrooms. The spaetzel was also just okay but had good texure. Dish seemed underseasoned. BF had the bratwurst plate, largely due to the \"Best German Bratwurst in Vegas!\" sign by the front door. And I'll say, damn, it was good. For a $13 plate though, I kind of felt it should have more than one sausage link and simple, basic sides of (bland) cabbage and (decent) fried potatoes. The $10 brats in the sandwiches section of the menu would have been better.  Service was spotty. Our order was taken and dishes brought out, but we weren't really checked on and had to hunt down takeout boxes. Female server we saw at the beginning of our visit wasn't seen again. Seems the staff share all the service, which unfortunately leads to a lack of consistency, as no one knows who is doing what.  Table sign indicates that they have a monthly buffet, the first Saturday of each month. Selection did not sound worth the price. If you are here for dinner, there's a Yelp check in offer for a 10% discount.",

    "text": "Stephen told me that his family is German. Very German.  When I first heard that, I expected his family to come out in lederhosen and dirndls. OK, Ok, They're not \"that\" traditional, but they are from Germany, and they know what the Old Country food should taste like.  The cafe is located behind a Popeye's and Arco gas station. We stopped by on the Tuesday after Memorial Day for lunch.  The last time we had \"German\" food in Vegas was at the touristy Hofbrauhaus, and we were disappointed.  I am pleased to say that this visit to Cafe Berlin was 1000% better.  When you walk in, the place isn't fancy. It's a simple cafe with German products and posters on the ceiling and wall.  What it lacks in decor, the place makes up with good food.  I had the Jaeger schnitzel, while Stephen had the Rahm schitzel, both served with spaetzle, a dumpling type pasta, while mom had the Rouladen, served with red cabbage and bread dumpling.  The food is made to order, and you can hear the cook pounding the pork to make the schnitzel. When the food arrived, few words were spoken while we ate, and the words spoken were \"here, try some of mine\".    The Scnitzel was delicious.  Perfectly fried outside, and covered in delicious gravy.  The big hit was the Rouladen.  The Rouladen is a beef roll (think flank steak) with bacon, onions and pickles, then rolled, cooked, and covered in gravy.  This was served with a dumpling about the size of a huge golf ball, and a serving of warm red cabbage.  This was a real traditional German meal.  Very German.  Our German adventure didn't end here, as mom ordered the apple strudel and Stephen had the German Chocolate Cherry cake.  Both desserts were not overly sweet, Between the 2 desserts, I did prefer the strudel more. The warm apple and flaky pastry crust, dipped in the vanilla sauce was so good.  Lunch for 3, along with 2 sodas, 2 beers, coffee, and dessert came to $80-something. Perhaps a little pricey since we splurged, but it was probably the highlight of our Vegas jaunt.  Mom liked it, and that's the biggest critic IMHO.",

The waitresses were super attentive, coming in every so often to refill water and if we needed anything else.   I ordered the bratwurst. It came with red cabbage and potatoes and can I just say, wow.  The bratwurst was juicy and savory, the red cabbage was bright and acidic, and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned and added a crunch to the dish. I loved putting it all together and eating it in one bite. Really fantastic.   I was worried that one sausage was not going to cut it, but I managed to finish the plate. I have a tendency to eat half my food in most places though. So, if you tend to eat more, I recommend spending the extra cash and getting a 2nd sausage.  Overall,  we really loved this place. We plan to come again when they do thier Saturday buffet deal! We were so full that we didn't have a chance to eat dessert so that is on the to-do list as well!",

I guess some German people are born racist, but I got many other German friends that are open minded and not racist. I guess the old generation are more likely to be racist. Anyway, in terms of food, they are OK, I had better. I would recommend to go to Hofbrauhaus near the new strip. They are more friendly, fun place to go and all are welcome and will be treated equally.",

The food came out before the pretzel which was odd because that was supposed to be my appetizer. The pork schnitzel was ok, breading was a little strange though, almost like a panko breading. The biggest disappointment was the german potatoe salad. It tasted like one big onion. The potatoe salad at the Haufbrauhaus is much better and more authentic tasting surprisingly. After I was almost done with my meal I got my pretzel. I figured the waitress had forgotten about it and was surprised to be getting it. Service was off, barely got any attention as the waitress was busy chatting with her friend at the bar.",

    "text": "We came in for lunch with a $20 Yelp Deal.  The restaurant was located on W Sunset Rd/S Decatur Blvd in a gas station strip mall in Las Vegas.  There is a partition in front of the bathroom door.  The server gave us the dinner menus and he did not ask for our drink order..  The prices were really expensive.  My friend went up to the counter and asked if they had lunch menus.  There was one other couple having lunch.  A female server took our order.  My friend ordered the Schweine Schnitzel and I ordered the Bockwurst.  Another couple walked in and sat behind us.  The female server came out of the kitchen and served  the couple behind us 25 minutes after we sat down.  They did not recognized what they had ordered.  The server went to the window at the kitchen and talk to the chef.  I heard her say she gave the food to the wrong table.    She never came back to our table to appologize or offer us a free appetizer or beverage while we waited for our lunch.  How could she server the other couple our food!?  The male server brought us our food about 9 minutes later.  He did not say anything about the mix up either.  The Bockwurst was tasty.  The fried potatoes had pieces of crisp bacon.  The red cabbage was okay.  The Schweine Schnitzel was breaded.  There was no sauce or anything on it.  The  scoop of German potato salad was served cold.  The male server asked if we saved room for dessert.  My friend mentioned the mix up and asked for a free strudle.  He only offered us one.    The Apple Strudle was served heated with a side of whipped cream and unsweeted cream in a dish.  It was the best part of the meal, but did not make up for the attitudes of the servers.",

    "text": "Cafe Berlin is a very nice, comfortable diner for a variety of German bratwursts and schnitzels! Yes, German beer and wine, too! Go enjoy!  LONG VERSION:  - It's a medium size, bright, comfortable cafe/diner with family style atmosphere; located in a small plaza by a gas station and Popeyes.   It has an impressive lunch and dinner menu [See Pics] with several choices of bratwursts and schnitzels; along with a few kinds of German beers and wine by the bottle.  I went there for late lunch around 2:30pm on a Tue, it was understandably not too crowded, with only 3 tables of customers there. The owner was working all alone by herself, from taking/bringing out orders to bussing tables and manning the register! She was very friendly and helpful, chatting up with customers, to some of them in German. I take that as a sign of a place for good genuine German food!  I had a Nuenberger bratwurst sandwich with sauerkraut and grilled onions ($8.99), and a bottle of dark beer ($4.99). The bratwurst was grilled to perfection with somewhat cripy skin outside and juicy and flavorful inside, tasty in every bite. The grilled onions added wonderful aroma and taste. The sauerkraut had the right acidity I liked, but was a bit overcooked. The mustard came in a small squeeze bottle. It did not have any special taste. So, I decided to do without it on my bratwurst. The bottle of dark beer, Warsteine, was excellent, though on the expensive side.  I wish Cafe Berlin would eventually serve draft beers! I also had coffee, which was hot enough, but pretty weak.  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch experience very much, and will go back with friends to sample some more good stuff from their large selection of wursts and schnitzels. I'll update my review after that.  I am very happy that we now have two places in Vegas, where we can get some good genuine German cuisine. Dita's is a fast food place where its German dishes are good but limited to only bratwurst, $4 and currywurst, $6. Cafe Berlin, on the other hand, is a very nice family restaurant/cafe, which offers a good selection of wursts and schnitzels (at much higher prices, of course), as well as German beer and wine! So, take your pick to suit your mood of the moment.  A few KIND NOTES to Cafe Berlin management:  1. A WISH:  - PLEASE start having \"Happy Hour\" soon with small sampler plates, over German \"draft\" beers? Well, I said it was a WISH!  2. MINOR CRTICISM: - The mustard bottle with my bratwurst order was almost empty, DIFFICULT to squeeze anything out. I think a good restaurant needs to pay more attention to details like that.  - The lady owner gave some holiday cookies at the end of our meals - a very nice touch for the holidays! So I even ordered coffee for that. But, the owner never did ask if I needed a coffee refill (- the coffee is listed as \"bottomless\" on the menu). Perhaps, the owner really did not normally wait on tables. She did it that day was possibly ONLY BECAUSE her regular waitress was NOT on duty? - Yes, I know those are very minor stuff, but minor stuff like those could sometimes put customers off. If the restaurant do it right, such as offering customers coffee refills and asking how the meals are, it will make customers feel welcome and special.   Peterskis3, Dec 2012",

Atmosphere:  it's a small, very casual place, but there's a nice balance of German & Vegas decor on the walls.    Service:  the man who seated & served us was so friendly and attentive.  I felt extremely welcomed and he was willing to answer any questions we had about the menu.    Food:  I was so delighted seeing all of this food that only my mother had made me!  Potato Pancakes with Sour Cream & Applesauce!  Rouladin!  Cucumber Salad!  Pretzel!  Pea Soup!  It was great, the chef in the back really knows what they're doing; all the flavors were spot-on!!  I just wish that I had more time in Vegas and a larger stomach.  I would love to try their spaetzle and sauerkraut and snitzle!  The apple streudel was great too and came with whipped cream and this sweet cream sauce.  My only warning is that their espresso/capuccino is not very good.  I don't know if there coffee is any better, but the man explained that they have a machine that automatically makes the espresso & capuccino, so you've been warned.    If you like German food you will LOVE this place!!!  It's just so rare to find German restaurants but this one was great!",

    "text": "How do you say excellent in German? I have no idea, but that pretty much sums up my meal tonight. A few girlfriends and I get together once a month for dinner. I saw this place while getting gas one day on my lunch break, Yelped it, and after reading all the positive reviews told the girls we should check it out. I chose this night in particular because they have the dinner buffet. Every first Saturday of the month they offer an ayce buffet. It says reservations are recommended on buffet night, but I would say they are mandatory. This place is small on the inside with maybe 10-12 tables, and they were all full. We had resos for 4pm and were seated promptly. Someone took our drink order and showed us to the buffet table. Now keep in mind I have never had German food before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.   The buffet is small, but everything looked good. They had about 5 hot trays with different offerings. Mashed potatoes, spaetzle, roasted chicken, veggies, red cabbage, sauerkraut, 3 different types of sausages, schnitzel, 3 different gravies, potato salad, and a few small desserts. I tried some of everything and hands down my favorite thing was the schnitzel with mushrooom gravy. The schnitzel was crispy and flavorful, and the mushroom gravy was a delicious complement. If no one was watching, I might have licked my plate clean. I went back for seconds for this.  I didn't care for the sausages too much or the spaetzle. The sausages tasted all the same to me. Unfortunately the sign at the buffet just said \"sausages,\" so I wasn't too sure what I was actually eating. My main complaint is the dessert, or lack thereof. At the end of the buffet there was a paper plate that had a few mini muffins and some chocolate and powdered mini donuts, like the kind you buy in a 6 pack at the gas station. Pretty lame. They do have a dessert case with black forest cake and different kinds of homemade strudel. My suggestion would be to have some of those items included in the buffet for dessert. My last complaint would be the price tag on the buffet. For the amount of items, most of them being sides, I think the price is a bit too high. It's not a deal breaker though. I will definitely be back. If you are thinking about checking this place out I would suggest going on buffet night, so you can taste a little bit of everything and see what you like. I will be back for sure.  Yelp 2015 Review #3",

Their Beers excellent, I like the Video on the wall that has the pictures of the food on their menu which helps give you an idea of the food your ordering since everything is German specialty. A plate can be shared by 2 persons ,lunch is prized less than dinner which is understood. The owner very pleasant man he took his time to explain the seasoning used for the food you order. I recommend this place to my friends n for dessert try the apple strudel w a scope of  Vanilla Ice cream so awesome. Will be back !!!",

The food is always excellent.  I've been here about 20 times over the years with all sorts of different people, and everyone always raves about how tasty the food is.  You must get a pretzel with obatzter cheese for an appetizer.  And they have german beers on tap!  My favorite is the Konig Ludwig Dunkel in a giant stein.  My only complaint is that the price is a little high for me to afford coming here all the time.  But I still love it, and I will be back again and again!",

When you first walk in, it doesn't really remind you of anything you have seen in Germany, except for the German lady working there!  We sat down and ordered a Hefe-weizen which was served in the correct glass; something unusual for this area. We ordered the jaeger schnitzel and chicken cordon bleu. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and served with a side of spaetzle that reminded me of Germany! For dessert, we ordered the cherry strudel with fresh creme. It was also excellent and very filling. Our bill came to about $85.00 for 3 people - probably a little more than you would pay at an ordinary cafe but the portions were huge and the food quality was excellent. Thumbs up!",

My friend and I came here after she got her windows tinted, and she was in the mood to be German.  She got a platter of sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut; I got the Spaetzl with cheese and a side of pan fried potatoes.  The waitress was really fast and the food came out hot and quick- but my taters had bacon in them. I had no idea they would, and when I asked for a new plate sans bacon she took it back and gave me a new one. YAY! The sides do not say what they are clearly, so ask just in case.  The Spaetzl was so yummy and fresh, and very good with the cheese (you can get it with meatless sauce as well, but cheese is better!) My friend devoured her plate, including the sauerkraut which she hated as a kid.  Then we got STRUDEL!!!! GAAAHHHHH I love strudel! They have three types: Blueberry, Cherry and Apple, and they come with whipped cream and vanilla sauce. SO FRICKEN GOOD!   Prices were moderate, and it seems they have a German Buffet here once a month- where you can have ALL YOU CAN EAT STRUDEL!",

My friend had some pasta from the vegetarian menu and a side of potatoes (warning, the potatoes have bacon in them so if you're a veggie, make sure you request them without!)

This will probably run you around $20 ~ not cheap by Vegas standards but this should be normal for anyone visiting from NYC, SF, or even LA.  Don't let the ghetto ambiance fool you.

    "text": "At the urging of a friend we stopped in here Wednesday at about 2:30 PM. It is part of a small Gas Station Strip Mall. Very unassuming and quiet looking outside at the front. Walking in we could see a clean looking, open dining area, with a cheerful Hostess / Wait Person who greeted us and took us to a nice table.  The dining room is surprisingly big. It is open, clean, friendly, and has an almost cafeteria style design to it.  German and American beers are available in big glasses so you can Gage the color. The heavy thick head on the cold German beer is inviting and the aroma is very full bodied.   The menu has a number of German style items to choose from along with a special available. There are Sausages (Wursts)  with very wonderful looking sides of pan fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, sauerkraut, red cabbage, etc. There is also a sandwich board in the menu that looks like a fine way \"handle\" your lunch. Then the menu describes some very flavorful sounding pork schnitzel platters and a pork or chicken cordon bleu  The menu touts  very nice Vegetarian selections both hot and cold.   Finally, to insure that no one is left out there is a Kid's menu that allows them to also try these delights.  We opted for the Rollentini Special. Wonderful beef  roll up with spices and a pickle spear in the middle. There was a potato dumpling and red cabbage as sides. The rollentini and the dumpling came with an unbelievable tasty sauce that insured this presentation will be ordered by us again.  We finished our meal by splitting a piece of \"home made\" cherry strudel that was so good be ordered another piece of cherry and a piece of apple to take home.  Bottom line: Clean, flavorful ethnic food, good service. We will be back soon.",

I was surprised to find Cafe Berlin here in Vegas and was very pleasantly surprised to find that their Radler and spaetzle brought me right back to my Europe ski vacay.  The staff was very warm and welcoming. I will definitely be back soon :)",
