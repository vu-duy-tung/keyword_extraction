I usually also order guac and chips as well. They also have a variety of other tacos you can choose from. Reasonable prices and everyone there is friendly. You may have to wait in line depending on what time you go there because it can be busy around lunch and dinner. A must try for any taco lover.",

    "text": "Great concept (no table service here - each person on his/her own). Fast and fresh. Chaotic and confusing.  You get all of that here. There are signs posted above the food stations, but no one directing newbies in how to place an order nor are there distinct lines for people to wait in. If it's busy, you just wait in a lump of people hoping you're not cutting someone off and that you're in the right line.   Stand behind the sign where you want to order that particular item. If you want to order a carne asada street taco and a burrito, yes, you have to stand and wait in two separate lines.  Besides the chaos, the food service was impressive. They make the food right in front of you on a hot grill. The street corn on a stick was generously buttered and seasoned, and the burritos were as big as Chipotle's. They expedite your order so you don't have to wait too long. The salsa station has a good variety of mild, medium, and hot sauces.  There is plenty of seating throughout. So elbow your way to the front of the line, grab your food, then grab a seat and enjoy.",

The food was still amazing. The workers worked as fast as they could. They've got so many vegetarian options... Mexican vegetarian heaven... or pretty close. They've got salsas, pickled jalapenos, all the good fixings - self serve. I would say, 4 burritos, 10 tacos, 4 elotes, 1 burrito bowl later, we were stuffed and happy. So so happy. I can't wait to come back. Gracias from California!",

    "text": "I came here for the first time last night and I was lucky enough to meet two friends in the parking lot.  They led me through the process and made it easy for a Taco y Taco newbie to order what I wanted.  The staff was super friendly and I soon had two tacos--one al pastor and one of their Vampiro.  I also got an elote--the first time I've had this at a Mexican restaurant.  I am a fan of this street food for sure.  The tacos were good.  I got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on, so tasting for details wasn't too much of an option.  I got the Vampiro with carnitas.  The server grabbed a large piece of pork that was simmering in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the Vampiro.  This was very tasty and I'm glad I got it.  As for the elote, I really am a fan.  The cotija and then dusting with Mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination.  Last night was Mariachi Monday and there was a Mariachi band playing in the foyer and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour I was there.  It did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere.  The restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting.  However, when you forget something, like getting a drink and some plastic utensils, it's down the steps and back up again.  Better to get your hunger on a bit more.  As I said before, the staff was really great!  They'll ham it up and pose for any photo op you want and they are helpful in answering any questions.  The ladies at thew register were just the same.  This really was a good stop for tacos.",

There's also a good amount of food options.    I love the carnitas tacos with flour tortillas and everything on it.   Very generous with the meat.  No burned or tough meat.  Cooked tender and yummy!    Nachos are big and good for my boyfriend and I to share.   Perfect ratio of toppings to chips. Plenty of cheese!    The corn!!!!   Mayo, cheese, seasoning!  Must order.    Quesadillas were too cheesy for me. Will ask for less next time. Their generosity is a quality I do appreciate though.   Everyone appreciated a bar... Drink away!  Would like to take advantage of the live entertainment sometime.   The music plays loud.  I enjoy the variety. At times I find myself speaking loudly to overcome the volume.

    "text": "If you want an upscale-looking place with a taqueria-size price tag, bookmark this place. After hearing so much, it's hard to see how the reputation fits in with the reality. Coming from San Antonio, I'm used to quality taqueria fare, and though this place tries to do an upscale version, I'm not fully on board.  Between the line backup (there's not enough space for separate meat counters!) and the music being too loud for employees to hear my order (a live mariachi in a cavernous space?!), there is a disconnect between the concept and the actual facilitation of business.  Salsa bar has ridiculously tiny cups (without lids) and upstairs seating area lacks any sort of napkin/utensil station, warranting multiple trips up and down the narrow stairs. I appreciated that there were grilled onions, though.   Execution issues aside, the food was just okay. By the time I got my corn and paid, my tacos were cold. The lengua, asada, and barbacoa were all mushy to the point that I wasn't sure which meat was which, and they should all be distinct. As others have said, I didn't care for the pineapple salsa on the asada. The corn was tasty, but the chips tasted like they'd been sitting out. I've been happier spending $12 at a taco truck, but I'd come back here at someone else's request.",

Not to mention the line to pay in. Oh, then the salsa bar line. Ugh.   I couldn't find the napkins either and that irritated me. We sat upstairs and waited 30 full minutes for them to get our mole fries to us. I am positive they forgot after 2 reminders even. I watched two guys get theirs with no problem. They consisted of sweet potato fries with a mole sauce, chicken, and cojita cheese. This was worth the 3 stars. The tacos were soaked in a weird sauce and the quesadilla was so plain I wanted to take it back.   The decor was cute and hip. There is a full bar. They have \"patio\" seating but I can pass on that. It's 3 tables on the side of the building.   I'm pretty sure we won't be back. Nothing impressed me there and it's not close to home anyway. :)",

My favorites are the Al Pastor tacos and the Tripas (Fried beef entrails; don't knock em until you try em because they are really delicious!).   They have basic chicken, pork, and beef tacos, as well as specialty tacos, such as the Al pastor, Tripas, and carnitas. They also have some veg options. My girlfriend is vegan so she gets the Azteca, which is cactus with cilantro, onions, avocado, just no cheese. The bar is huge as well so if you'd like a cocktail or a few shots with your food, you're in a good place.   The restaurant itself is absolutely huge, you have a huge floor of tables and they also have upstairs seating with a view of the whole restaurant. The staff is also very nice and make every experience a good one. I love coming here and I will continue to come here for great tacos in a great atmosphere!

Three stars and that's only because it was quick and cheap but unmemorable. Walking in, the place was clean, semi-busy, no long lines at the cashier. Actually, there weren't any designated lines anywhere. So if it's your first time, look forward to finding your way around or asking a fellow customer how to maneuver around the restaurant.   After we found out who to ask for food, we grabbed a tray and placed our order. Ordered a quesadilla, tacos and corn on the cob. Quesadilla was loaded with cheese, cut up and placed one on top of the other so I had to eat it with a fork and knife because they were too heavy and soggy to lift. Overall food lacked flavor and was unmemorable.   Now that I know what to do, I'll give this place a second try, at night during one of their busy night events.",

Guess I've been to too many cities who serve real street corn and it's grilled. The cooks behind the counters were cool and helped me decide. However either girl at the cashier didn't say a peep to me which was really awkward. We just rang up my food, I tipped them, asked them for to go tops on the pickled carrots and all without one sound coming from them...weird. Lol. Nevertheless I might come back.",

Their bar service is also great. The bartender always treats us right and has the best beer list I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant. They also have a legit cocktail menu. Everyone is always so nice here too--if you can't pronounce something because of your inherent whiteness (like me), they're super nice and nonjudgmental. They're just happy you're there to eat their delicious food. And delicious it is!",

I haven't been to this building since it was Fado's, about 5 years ago.   I absolutely love what they've done with the space!!    The main room is very open, with plenty of space, which is good.  This place was PACKED at lunch time!  I even ran into Shirley B!  The setup is the same as the old spot:  different stations for what kind of tacos/meats that you want.   This time, I had an al pastor (duh), a chorizo taco, and a chorizo mulas.  My friend and I also tried tripas for the first time, which was surprisingly good. :)  Same quality food, more space, and it feels more like a modern bar/eatery than a cantina.  I really like it.  My only sad point is that its a bit far for me to drive.  Luckily, I have the original spot whenever I'm not in Henderson.   Great job, Taco y Taco crew!!!!",

Thank you Taco y Taco for providing quality food at affordable prices. I will be a frequent customer i promise. I actually met one of the owners the other day when i was there and was able to tell her how much i liked the place. Everything i have tried so far has been great well maybe except the burrito I will prob still go to chipotle for that. The flour tortillas there are just way better.

You have to get in different lines for different meats but the lines are reasonable and service is efficient and friendly. It's also nice that the meat dudes all speak reasonable English since my Spanish isn't the best and it's nice to be able to ask questions.   EVERYTHING I've had has been delicious.

Big screen tvs show the latest sporting event and a full service bar is available for those who wish to endulge.  A rep is there to greet newcomers to explain how the ordering works.  There are three different lines, depending on what you want - tacos, burritos, bowls or which meat you are interested in - al pastor, asada, etc...  Cooks carve your meat selection and assemble your order in front of you.  A salsa bar is available with a variety of salsas and pickled vegetables.  The taste is very authentic and flavorful.  Definitely worth returning!",

On a whim I ordered the mole fries with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries and chicken. Loved the fries, but the chicken was a little dry, so if I order them again I would either try another meat or skip the protein all together. Mariachi Monday (6-7pm) was a nice treat but be prepared not to be able to have a conversation. I will definitely be coming back! What a great treat to have near Henderson!",

    "text": "This place knows how to do tacos and nachos. Though it may be intimidating ordering food from this place (especially when it is super busy), it is all part of the experience.   When first arriving, you have a choice of which line you want to join, according to the type of meat you want. Al Pastor is their most popular, but they have your regulars from Carne Asada, Pollo, Lengua, and more. My personal favorites are the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada.   For the Al Pastor, I like it in tacos and the Mula with everything on it, which includes pineapple chunks, onions, and cilantro. The pork is slightly sweet and is tender, and the pineapple gives it an extra dimension of flavor and sweetness. The onions gave an extra crunch and helped offset the sweetness of the pork and pineapple. But for those who are wondering what Mula is, this is like a taco but instead of just using tortillas, they use tortillas that have cheese melted on them. If you have no idea what I am talking about, trust me and just try an Al Pastor Mula.  In addition, the Carne Asada tacos and nachos are amazing. The Carne Asada is tender and lightly seasoned so the natural flavors of the beef comes out. They were topped with a house made guacamole, which had slight chunks of avocado while still being smooth, cilantro, and chopped onions. The nachos were also very good, where it used a combination of shredded cheeses, cilantro, guacamole, and sour cream.  This is one of my favorite taco places, do yourself a favor and try it out!",

However, I always get sick after eating it because I have a sensitive stomach. They dip the tortilla in oil and the greasiness of it all upsets my stomach. But the meats are always so soft and flavorful and my coworkers tend to come here often! I love getting their street corn when we come here to eat instead of tacos.   The price is a little steep for what it is, I think $3 a taco.  Lots of room for seating if you're dining in and on a couple of occasions I've been here, there was also live music!",

    "text": "If daily taco consumption did not lead to obesity, you would find me here every single day of the week. Honesty, I have never had an unsatisfying meal here after a few years of coming here.   Location - This is located conveniently on Eastern, South of the 215. It's in the most poppin' food plaza in Henderson (in my opinion) next to Sushi Hiro, Smash Burger, and Cafe Zupas. There's plenty of parking AND seating. The restaurant is two stories and even on National Taco Day, there were open seats.   Food - THERE ARE SO MANY TYPES OF FOODS HERE. If your heart desires quesadilla, they have it. Mexican corn? Got it. So many choices of meat and toppings and they even have alcoholic beverages! I usually opt for the Chicken Quesadilla w/ guacamole and sour cream or three chicken tacos. If I'm feeling extra \"yolo\", I order the chicken fries (which are like nachos but with french fries instead of tortilla chips). All of the meat are chopped as you order it and the items are made freshly right in front of you. There's also a complimentary bar with salsa and toppings.   Service - As hectic as it gets, everyone tries their best to accommodate to everyone while remaining friendly. It's kind of a weird system where you get into different lines to order certain food items, but it's efficient (when other customers aren't scattered and cutting).   I would highly, highly recommend coming here to fulfill your Mexican food needs. I always leave with a happy tummy!",

The only complaints I have are that when you first walk in, its confusing for a first timer. Once I got the lines down, it was fine. Also the salsa bar leaves a lot to be desired if you don't like spicy/hot sauces. Even the mild tomatillo was insanely hot to me. The beans saved the salsa bar though. They're so delicious!

The tacos here are authentic and delicious and so worth the trouble!  My go to is the Al pastor tacos and second in line are the carne asada.   Good quality meats, freshly made, oily tortillas, nice and spicy salsas.   To drink I like their Jamaica (hibiscus tea) , it tastes real unlike some places that use the bland fountain version.

    "text": "Omg.  This is my spot since moving to CA. I love tacos, as being from LA, we love our tacos. I was devastated when I learned I would be moving to Las Vegas and leaving good Mexican food behind.   Fast forward to trying out this place- it's far from where I stay, but I'll live. I love every single meat option (have had them all in a taco form each time I come) and have never been disappointed. I just recently ventured on the unbeaten path and had a burrito and bowl from here. The burrito is amazing as well- and the bowl is an adjustment from chipotles size and flavor.  But I'm not complaining.   I also want to recommend the margaritas with a sugar rim; they are delicious and strong, but sweet, so the buzz sneaks up on you (just the way I like it!).   Go there now!",

Being a new Vegas resident coming from growing up in California, finding a solid taqueria with great food and prices that don't rip you off is hard to come by in Las Vegas. I've tried many but the only place here in Vegas that remains consistent in taste and doesn't hurt my wallet is Taco y Taco. The beautiful interior design is just a plus, and surprisingly enough, prices are great!   Their Al Pastor is my FAVE. The rest of their meats are great with tender and flavor too, but if you're a Taco noob and wanna try something other than basic carne asada (their carne asada is amazing too), you must get their al Pastor. Whenever I come in the workers are very nice with a hospitable sense of humor and the place is well kept and clean! Love Taco y Taco!!!",

    "text": "We finally visited this place for the first time the other day. It had been on my list literally since it opened. This is the spot that used to be another restaurant, and they did rather little to the interior and decor to alter it.  For first timers, the setup can be quite confusing. There is no signage or formed lines/barricades directing you (like at Cafe Rio or somewhere). And that left us frazzled and complaining from the start. Some rope and an \"order here\" sign would go a long way.  So here's how it works: There are 4 areas. One for al pastor, one for a bunch of other meats, one for carne asada, and one for nachos and all other items (in that order, from left to right). Approach what you want and order. Slide down with your tray and keep ordering until you are done and/or reach the cashier. You can get each meat as a taco, a mula, a vampiro, or a couple of other ways. Mulas and vampiros are essentially meat between two tortillas with cheese and other toppings. Mula = soft. Vampiro = crunchy.  Once we figured it out, after approaching the cashier and asking, we got in one of the lines, received a tray, and began placing our order. We had, honestly, never heard of mula or vampiro, so we had to have those explained to us - which was simply showing us a picture. Not particularly helpful, but we felt adventurous. We opted for an al pastor mula and al pastor vampiro. We then proceeded to order the mole fries - sweet potato fries with chicken, cheese, and mole sauce.  The mula and vampiro were good and reasonably priced. The al pastor was quite tasty and seasoned perfectly with loads of flavor. The mole fries were expensive and a left down. You got a lot of them, but they totally lacked flavor.  We also got an order of just chips so we could try out their salsa bar. They had several different salsas and all were tasty. The habanero was easily my favorite. None of the \"hot\" salsas were actually all that spicy.  All in all, it was an a-ok meal and experience. I think now that we know the process and what everything is, we will have a better experience if we return. In short, the al pastor was super tasty and authentic. The ambiance and experience was lacking.",

Need to stop off one of these days and just plop down at the bar and drink with tacos in hand! Haha.  Don't let the size of the tacos fool you. 2 will fill you. 3 it gets a little too tight. 4 would be an overkill and be prepared to throw the towel in. So with that said, I got the chicharon, lengua, tripas, and carnitas. Also got an elotes.  Suffice it to say, I got my #tacotuesday fix",

    "text": "It sucks having to drive all the way to charleston and etc... for mexican street tacos but I usually suck it up and just do it. Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise.   There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk.   Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.  Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.  Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.  Overall: a nice option to get authentic mexican tacos in henderson but places like tacos el gordo is still better",

I've been here a number of times and maybe I've just been taco wasted on vampiro and carnitas?   My most recent visit here was on Taco Tuesday and the place was packed, all the taco lines were full and the burrito area was starting to fill up as well. I have to hand it to Taco Y Taco; they emptied the lines very quick and sent everyone on their way to taco happiness. I was not partaking in the taco fiesta today, nope, chicken mole fries were in my future.   Shredded chicken, creamy mole sauce, shredded cheese and cotija cheese all on top of a mound of sweet potato fries. The sweet crispy fries mixed with the savory sweet mole sauce is amazing, then you add super tender marinated chicken to the food fiesta and all bets are off.   Mole Fries is a cure all meal; hangovers, gone!, hunger pains, gone!, the mixed feeling of angry and hungry or, \"Hangry\" as I like to call it, all gone! Besides the moles fries, Taco Y Taco has... amazing tacos, duh. Cooked old school like I used to see when I would visit TJ when I lived in San Diego. The meat is simmered for hours and then chopped in front of you and placed on a handmade tortilla.   TYT also offers a full bar, I recommend getting a Red Beer. Great compliment to some amazing authentic Mexican food.",

While sitting here at my table I have watched the cashier touch the sour cream bottles multiple times while the person on the line is touching them while making the food, a guy making street tacos dip something in a sauce bare handed and eat it and the bartender call a girl \"big booty hoe\" I quote. Now that I told you about the show lets talk about the food..........oh yeah nothing special there. It taste like well nothing. Nothing stood out from the burrito, the nachos or the corn.",

    "text": "Soooooo glad to get an authentic taco place in Henderson. Usually I have to go all the way to north town! The place is really nice and upscaled compared to original taco shops, but the customers here are different and prominently white so I didn't expect an authentic and rustic looking taco place. Plus it wouldn't fit in the neighborhood it is in. Personally I love that the place is modern but the food is authentic. It's clean and a great place to go eat. Prices are a tiny bit higher than in the north but that was expected. Thankful that I can go 10 minutes down the street instead of half an hour across town. If only we had an authentic Mexican grocery store near so my mom can get all her needed ingredients she drives across town for. Get on it people!! Haha",

The mole sweet potato fries were amazing, and paired perfectly with the margarita de casa. The margarita was so tasty that I had to get a second one, and could've sat there drinking them all night. I love the fact that they get all their meats and tortillas from Los Compadres which is one of my favorite carnicerias in town. This will definitely be my new taco spot.",

Awesome, so then I was waiting for ten minutes just to order two tacos that ended up being half-assed because they ran out of salsa as well as the other toppings. I also ordered al pastor fries, which were super greasy. The meat looked burnt and tasted super dry. It definitely wasn't just cut off of the rotisserie. Uhhh, I felt like it was meant to be thrown away and not served to anyone. Finally, when I asked about Taco Tuesday, the cashier rudely dismissed me without answering my question. I was there during the correct hours but okay... Why promote your specials if you aren't going to honor them? In the future, I'll just make the drive to Tacos El Gordo.",

It was $4.15 for chips and guacamole and it wasn't worth it. The chips were hard, stale and the guacamole was flavorless. The Carne Asada tasted like it wAs cooked with fish! Awful!! I was in love with the Carne Asada but now i have to rethink it. Customer service was not great all they cared about is sitting watching tv or talking about what there plans were in Spanish. Not satisfied!!",

I had a taco de carne asada, lengua and al pastor. She ordered a mexican style street corn. The bartender Eddie was very friendly and made the stop even more enjoyable! Now on to the food! The tacos were very tasty as was the corn according to my gf. The tacos came with everything and they were filling!

As for the rest of the time, they aren't 'blasting club music' all the time at all, they will play a wide variety of music and on soccer/NFL days they will switch to the audio feed so you can enjoy the game. In addition, if you can't figure out how to order, or if you don't know what something is, ASK! The staff is very nice and accommodating, even thought the lines leave a little to be desired, admittedly. Must try the al pastor tacos, don't be afraid to try the cabeza, lengua, or tripas also. Corn on the cob street-style is delicious as well.  If you're expecting Taco-Bell and are going to order a quesadilla and a chicken taco, save a few bucks and a yelp review complaining about something you don't know and just get your Taco Bell. If you're into trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone, this is a place for you.  With seats at the bar almost always available and the managers/owners(?) always around, this is a new favorite place to frequent. Happy Hour is nice, but you don't need to break the bank to eat here even during regular hours.  Must visit!!!",

They are not always neat. They should have someone on the floor ensuring the restaurant is clean.  3. Big 2 story restaurant yet, they dont always open 2nd floor so its crowded af in 1st floor. One job, only one job you have Taco y Taco. Tssss.   PROS:  They have everything from tacos, nachos, bowls, sopes, & mulas (like a taco quesadilla, tortilla is thick, like a sope, greasy af but good af too)   What I really love the most about this place is that they also have vegetarian options.

Walk in and walk towards the meat station. Here there are 3 lines, this is where you choose your meal and your meat choice.   2. Walk to your left and proceed to add anything you want to your order. Add an ear of corn and all the trimmings (like the \"elote man\" from the park in the hood).   3. Pay   4. Add your salsa fixings from the salsa station and load up on the limes    5. Sit anywhere you want. Grab a high chair for the kids while you dispense your soda and fially..   6. Enjoy!   If you need to use the restroom, you can find them on the right of the restaurant.   NOTE: There is not a changing table in the womans or mens bathroom so make sure you bring something to lay on the floor to change your child or just go out to the car and do it there.  I highly recommend this place for your family to eat out at.",

I was asking just to cut in half not to place in a cup or anything tedious. I would also understand if it was busy but it was not. Plenty of staff.

And then she said oh take this ones and hand me to go plastic containers but I guess she forgot to put them in the bag., I'm assuming.  When I was leaving I noticed that she moved to the bar area so I'm assuming she was the bartender, I did wait to get her attention while she was on the phone so of course by the time I got home my food was cold, I live super close and still I had to reheat all the food , the guacamole was already brownish ( I did noticed it was a bit brown when the taquero was serving me) so that was my fault for not telling him to give me new one, the al pastor Mula was extremely greasy, I literally have stomach pain, it was really bad, never coming back,  for the taqueros super nice but the food and the service at the register killed it completely, hoping owners look at this and take action and either train them better and show them the meaning of customer service and urgency.",

But for my husband, it would take $50 spent in this place to fill his belly alone.   I can see why there is the hype, and don't get me wrong the meat is good quality and there is a great selection of meats. For us, the food is just way overpriced. We will not be back.   The 3 lines is a good idea in theory. You stand in front of what grouping of meat you want, but then it gets chaotic when it comes time to line up to pay. The salsa bar is right in the middle of where people line up and not very well managed.   We ordered 2 sopes and 2 tacos and paid...$19. Holy Money Bags Batman, that is way too much money to be hungry at the end.   The tacos are tiny, the sope cheese stuck to the paper and made it nearly impossible to eat. I'm just used to my sope having cojita cheese not sticky and melted cheddar.   Overall it was clean and had lots of tables. This place has a bar as well. It's a hipster's delight. Bare walls and industrial type fixtures, I've never seen a Mexican food place outside of Chipotle look so modern. This place's theme is basically fresh, modern, and hip (basically the opposite of a street taco cart)  Glad we tried it but this was not the experience we were looking for.",

Decided for the first time to order a fish bowl during lunch. I came with a group of four that ordered a bowl and tacos with me. They had to make mine fresh since they don't hold fish in the steam wells up front.   The lady that served me started doing side work as my fish came off and was ready for me on the side. She refilled the guacamole, started cutting tomatoes, flipping pans and talked to the manager as I stared at my fish getting cold.   She told me it's coming. I told her that it's right next to her. I literally stared at my food getting cold over 10 minutes. She kept on walking back and forth and spoke to the manager. After she was done with her stuff, she finally took a step and grabbed my fish and flipped it from the foil to my bowl. Another guest asked me if I ordered yet, I said yes! I'm staring at my cold ass food- she knows too. They shook their head.   5 seconds it took to give me my food to meet the rest of my group. Too mad to even deal with it at the moment. I arrived at my table as my group was halfway done eating. I would go back and call her out. I'd give zero stars if I could. The nerve to tell me \"sorry for the wait\" 10 minutes later.  Pull the cameras and see how irritating it looks.",

    "text": "Decent food, but a horrible ordering system that outweighs the decent food.  We ordered a variety of menu items. My husband had a Chorizo Breakfast Burrito and that was his favorite item we tried. The burrito was large and would be plenty of food on its own. I ordered a Chicken Taco, a Carnitas Taco, Mexican Corn, and a Chorizo Mula. We also shared Chips & Guacamole. The chicken taco was decent, the carnitas didn't have enough flavor, and I loved the chorizo mula. The meats overall weren't as well flavored as other tacos I've had. The Mexican corn was not as good as I expected and didn't have a ton of flavor. The chips and guacamole were great. I liked all of the salsas I tried from the salsa bar.  My pet peeve is when a restaurant can make good food, but can't run a business. Taco Y Taco is the epitome of this. Listen to your customers and do something to improve your ordering system. I've heard people comment that other taco spots in town have the same ordering system. Guess what? Just because something has always been done a certain way isn't a legitimate reason to continue doing it poorly.   Here's how the ordering could be improved. Offer paper order sheets where customers mark what and how many items they want. Customers then hand the order form at the start of the cafeteria line and meet their order at the register at the end. Let the staff sort the separate meat areas in the back, stop making it the customer's problem.  The inside of the restaurant was a mess. I didn't see the staff clean a single table the entire time we were dining. It was fend for yourself at the least dirty table you could find. Silverware, condiments, and napkins are located on top of the trash cans next to dirty trays and whatever else people leave on top of the trash can. This needs to be moved to its own sanitary location.  It took us four years to give this spot a second try and it'll probably be at least that long before we visit again.",

So it was taco Tuesday and they got al pastor tacos for $2 in Tuesday's. And I like the fact they had pineapples on the tacos. I've never tried it that way. And they got a little salad bar looking buffet in the middle with limes and different sauces to put on the tacos. I would suggest to go before 6 to beat the dinner rush, it got busy at that time.  I was pleasantly impressed with the al pastor taco. I'll give it a 8/10 in flavor. Which is pretty decent In my book. The pineapple sweetness complimented the spicy pork in the tacos. My friend ordered the corn and I wasn't really impressed with it to be honest. But I did like the restaurant vibe in general; pretty chill and decent amount of seats. All my friends enjoyed their food. I would come back for taco Tuesday but I do still really like tacos el gordo. But I'll probably come back to maybe try the fries or chips and guacamole next time",

The guys who make the tacos and the registrar can be rude when you ask simple questions. The place is unkept and just dirty.  The tables are full of dirty plates, left over food and cups. There's leftover food on the seats, and the floor is also filthy. It almost seems like there's no respect for the customers. The furniture is broken and ripped. The cabinets and a bar by the entrance are very dusty. I never see anybody cleaning after when customers leave. It's just sad people have to put up with this when they go eat there. And, the tacos are not cheap although they are delicious. I could spend $40 for 2 people when I go eat. It's just unfortunate that food is great but we cannot enjoy our meal when the place is always dirty and unkept.  A hazard was brought to my attention in the men's restroom where there was a puddle of water and electric cords were hanging right by them. That wouldn't be a pretty outcome.",

    "text": "Best taco spot in Las Vegas, NV. I don't know why but from my experiences at taco joints in LV, they have separate lines for separate types of meat tacos (one line for pastor, one line for asada, etc). I honestly can't stand it (haha pun intended), but my friends and I just split up and stand in each line accordingly.  I devoured the pastor taco with the pineapple pieces in it and the carne asada taco was OK. Pastor was definitely worth the wait but NOT the asada because it was dry. I also had the soyrizo taco (vegan) but it was honestly sooo oily and hard to finish. The street corn with the mexican style was delicious. The micheladas here are strong and cold, which were perfect additions to the meal.   The restaurant has TV screens along the wall and a separate salsa bar where you can get more salsa, grilled onions and whatnot. I loved the grilled onions :D  Clean up is confusing because there's no real place to dispose of your goods/return the plates or utensils so the employees will be happy to collect it for you. Definitely want to come back again since it's a local's taco joint that is fairly priced!",

    "text": "I'm all about Mexican restaurants and especially those who carve the meat in front of you... but this one I just can't. Health comes first.   I came twice within weeks to see if it was any different. The second time when I walked in and saw the same problems as the first time, I walked out.   Sauces all around the containers... Dripping to the floor. Meat pieces on the floor. The guy actually pushed if off the cutting board into the floor in front of me. Very unprofessional. One man was serving meat from one container then taking the same spoon and serving it from another meat container. This was over on the very left side by lane #2.   Which by the way, why are there three different lanes?! By the time I'm done waiting in one line I have to get in another then my taco was like warm.   Food was good, I enjoyed the corn, tacos and nachos.  My fiance who is a kitchen manager was with me both times and he said it made him uncomfortable eating there because he saw at least four health violations in front of him. Had we gotten sick we would have reported it to the health department. Luckily we didn't.",

It's clean and a big space for seating. They have 3 lines for different type of tacos. I got the lengua and al pastor. The lengua is pretty soft and both tacos were tasty. At this place, they add pineapples on the tacos which I'm not a huge fan of. However, if you like pineapples, you will enjoy it very much. The one thing I would complain about it that my food was cold by the time I sit down to eat. Otherwise, everything else wasn't bad. I would recommend for people to try out this place if they haven't.",

The carnitas were so good and tasted homemade in the past, and now it feels as though the meat is boiled in a plastic bag before it hits the grill. ( I don't know if that's what they actually do, but it's how it tastes )... The al pastor is still pretty good, but not nearly good enough to keep me coming back . The guacamole just sits out a bit to long for my taste. I would give the place 2 stars , but I do have fond memories of this place , so I gave it 3...",

The ordering system isn't hard, just look up. People have a hard time with literally just looking up lol.   I ordered 2 Carne Asada and 2 Al Pastor tacos \"WITH everything\".  I used to get confused before on how I get the tacos with the pineapple lol.  Anyway, I would come here again! Very clean inside and it's upscale from your typically hole in the wall taco shop.",

Hubby had three baracoa tacos, I had two fish tacos (I ordered one, but there was a communication oops) and an ear of corn.  We ordered chips and guacamole, as well as two glasses of Model Negra on draft.  Cost was $32.  The corn was great; will definitely order it again.  The chips weren't special, hot or salty.  The guacamole was just okay.  My fish tacos were surprisingly spicy but I didn't see or taste any fish.  Hubby liked his baracoa tacos.  We'll definitely be back and assume that we will eventually figure out the protocol for placing our orders.",

After looking around on Yelp, I came across tacos y tacos and I am glad that I did. When we got here, we found it to be extremely clean and well decorated. It is located in a huge plaza with tons of parking space and tables for seating.   As far as the food goes, the carne asada fries/nachos were alright. The tacos were much better with the al pastor taco being my favorite. My next favorite was the pollo tacos and then carne asada tacos. In comparison to tacos el gordo, it is not quite as good, but it's definitely a good second.   I would definitely recommend this place to people who don't want to deal with the hassles of tacos el gordo, which is further away, has longer lines, and has limited seating. This location has a salsa bar with a wide variety of salsas and sauces. It is kept fairly clean by the staff... I may have accidentally dribbled some sauce on the counter... I'm sorry!",

    "text": "Like most reviewers (I now read), I too was confused as how to get my food. There were multiple lines and if you don't know what you're doing, you get lost in the shuffle. I would hope they would read some of these and perhaps have a greeter or at least have the employees say \"Have you been here before?\" and if a customer says no, they can explain what's going on. So, nobody helped me and I stood confused and reading signs, which are mostly in Spanish, trying to figure out what I wanted to eat and how to get it. When I finally did get my turn I was in the wrong line so I had to scoot over two lines and get in the taco line. I got the two carne asada tacos and scooted over to the area to order nachos. The man said the machine they use to make nacho cheese is not working, so even though there is a big pile of yummy looking chips, no nachos today. I took my two lonely tacos over to the cashier, grabbed a fountain beverage cup and paid. I walked around the super crowded dining area only to find many un-bussed tables and a tiny spill on the floor. Walking ever so carefully I found a seat at the end of a long bench that had other patrons on the other side. Needless to say, it better get good real soon. I walked over to get my drink and next to the fountains was a totally full trash can that was so full it was opened with trash hanging out of it. On top of the trash can was more trash, and beer bottles and trays. Just wow. Long story short, the food was SUPER GOOD. The taco meat was so juicy and seasoned so nicely it had an awesome twang to it. The cheese was strong and tasty and the sour cream, so fresh and the perfect addition. Service was terrible. Nobody talked to me, nobody explained anything to me, nobody cleaned the dining room, nobody said goodbye. I will go back and give it another try, some day, I would like to try the nachos because they have a lot of good looking toppings. Maybe their nacho cheese warmer upper will be fixed by then (don't you have an oven or a microwave?) thanks!",

We usually get chicken or asada tacos and it comes with cilantro/onion, guacamole, and pico. The pico is a little spicy but still good. We also get the asada nachos with everything on them. They have a little salsa bar And the green sauce is very good. This place also has some the best horchata I've had from a \"fast food\" place. The tacos are $2.50 a taco and the nachos are like $8-9. Its averages out to about the same price of Roberto's but for more and better tasting food. I highly recommend trying this place it's definitely worth the wait.",

I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos/burritos/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc...   The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates.   The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food.   Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!",

    "text": "When I first heard about Taco Y Taco, I just flash back to those radio ads on 96.7 back in the day LOL.  This two-story taco heaven is one of my favorite taco joints in Las Vegas and it sucks that it's so far from where I live! To order, figure out which type of meat you'd like and line up under the corresponding sign. After you're done ordering, just go up to the cashier to pay.  My go to order is ALWAYS going to be Al Pastor tacos with everything on it (mexican-style pork tacos w/ cilantro, onions, + pineapples). If you've never had pineapples on your pork tacos, it's never too late. The sweetness of the fruit balances so well with the slight spice from the pork.  I recently craved elotes, so I decided to split one with my friend. Unfortunately we both felt like there was something missing from the flavor, so I wouldn't recommend it unless the crave is real. The same goes for the horchata since for some reason I always go back feeling like it tastes different compared to the last time I had their horchata. Either way, it still satisfies my random horchata cravings!  Don't forget to grab some sides and vegetables at the sauce bar. My go-to sauces are the guacamole sauce (non-spicy) and habanero (spicy) to mix it up between the tacos.  Even though the music is blasting, I like to head to the second floor to eat with my friends since people usually don't know that it exists. There is a happy hour from 5-7pm Sunday-Friday for $3 draft, $4 drinks, and $5 food/wine specials!  Overall, I'd give Taco Y Taco a 4.5... But I'm feelin' nice today. :)",

Some of the cashiers are not friendly and they talked to each other a lot and does not acknowledge the customer right away.   If it's your first time here do not be confuse! You basically walk up to the station of which meat you want in your tacos or go straight to the other station that they have (I seriously thought you had to go through each station until you reach the cashier but one of the staff told me you don't have to, so don't be like me. lol)   Everything is good and the portion is great. They do not skimp out on the meat and everything is just so flavorful. My favorite to get are carne asada tacos, al pastor tacos and elote. I also love that they have a self serve sauce bar in the middle of the restaurant. I usually bring friends or relatives visiting from out of state or country and they like this place as well. Definitely a must try!",

Upon coming in I was quite impressed by the restaurant itself. Very nice two story building with high end finishes featuring a market style set-up and a upper level dedicated to large parties with plenty of seating.   While the restaurant is much nicer than one would expect, the tacos are pretty average. I had the al pastor and the carne asada  I felt that both meats were lacking flavor. They have a large salsa bar which is probably there to compensate for the bland fillings. Even for street tacos I found the portions to be really small. I could easily have eaten 5 of them and at $2+ a pop, the $ adds up. Not a bad spot but I'm probably gonna have to find a new taco Tuesday spot.",

Fresh meats and hand made tortilla are the game changer here.  Service is good too.  Lot of times the guys joke around and engage in a brief conversation when you are ordering, which is always nice.  They took over the old Republic Kitchen which took over the old Fado so the ambiance is really nice for a taco concept.   I think the Sansone group has a long term tenant with these guys.",

We got the corn Mexican street style which is  on on the cob with mayo   cheese and Mexican spices. Fun to try but not amazing.  All in all we really like this place and will go back.",

The girl did not tell me guacamole was extra, and thus when I got to the register my vegetarian burrito cost me $10 which is pretty ridiculous. Coming from pricey San Francisco where I can get a vegetarian burrito for $5, makes me not want to pay double in Henderson.",

Only 4 stars because they seemed to take a while to get 4 tacos prepared and didn't put the same guacamole on all tacos. 2 tacos got actual guacamole and 2 tacos got a light green sauce the call avocado sauce. Also, the menu lists all the foods improperly. It lists tripas (intestine) as beef as well as other non beef choices. Maybe they think gringos don't understand Espanol",

    "text": "Great food. Feel like your really eating very good food from Mexico.  But a Bit challenging if your not familiar with the ordering process how to order.  So here is an easy way.  Look at the board ... there are three lines though they are not specifically shown to newbies as a line they are. So you order the food listed on that board for each line in each line.  So if someone jack rabbits in front of you don't be alarmed they may not be familiar with the process and start with line one and slide down cutting in front of line 2 and 3 accidentally thinking line moves from right to left not an individual line for each number.  Grab your patience with them and coach them like a pro.  You will find the ordeal of ordering worth it.  And If like me the first time there it didn't have descriptions on the board just the item name.  So if you want to know what your ordering as menu not at the individual lives go to cashier and they are right there where you order your beer or margarita. Great deal on happy hour for that too.  Or you could do the ordering the vary easiest way and order at the bar which is full service.  All the staff you meet there are wonderful and Monday night mariachi live music great.  Two thumbs because I don't have three :).  Great food, great price, great staff!",

I asked what the differences were in a few different pork preparations: pibil, buche, and carnitas and the guy gave us a sampling of each. All different cuts of meat marinated in various ways and each just as tasty as the one before it. Seriously, can't go wrong here. Thumbs up!",

Outside of the salt, taste was amazing!  Good selection of beers and FULL bar.  Ordering as everyone else mentions is confusing at best.",

For example; I ordered some Carne Asada Tacos and asked for cheese, which I was charged for, my wife simply waited to ask for cheese from the toppings bar and it was free. I understand \"upselling\" and have no problem with it, JUST DISCLOSE IT, AND MAKE IT CLEAR.  They run a \"smoke and mirror operation\" and end up nickel and diming you, totally unnecessary, most customers will pay for it, just be upfront. Did you think I wouldn't notice that my Tacos went from $2.50 each to $6.00??..please..! I mentioned it to the cashier, and to their credit they said oh sorry...and my tacos went back to $3. I said \"hey I'm not asking for anything free, I just don't understand your system\". Unfortunately neither did the cashier, because after she explained it I was more confused than ever.  DJ up front bumpin music, making all the seating near him virtually unusable. Business is in complete identity crisis...Is it a bar, fast food, taco place, night club..or just over priced street tacos???  But...the tacos were good..however, I never met a street taco that I didn't like.",

Upon entering, you're welcomed by one of the most confusing ordering set-ups ever.  You can't go to one person and order everything.  If you want tacos, go to the taco guy, burritos at the burrito guy, etc.  On top of that, the signage is terrible and confusing.  It's a terrible set-up.  Once you get your food and sit down, holding a conversation with others is nearly impossible.  They play techno and dance music at a volume where it makes it difficult to understand those with you.  Why do we need blaring techno?  Wouldn't some soft jazz or even quiet mariachi be more reasonable?  After all, this is a Mexican restaurant, not a night club.  The food was average at best.  There was nothing that stands out.  And no matter what anyone else says, it's NOT authentic. If you want authentic Mexican at a good price, check one of the Los Tacos locations. Real Mexican food in a nice atmosphere at a reasonable price.  As long as they keep their current concept, I will not be returning.",

For the price the food is good. I had two little carnitas tacos which were I believe $2.25 each. The meat wasnt really seasoned. Next time I'll get one of the beef tacos. The nachos looked good, too. One gripe is there are lots of choices but no descriptions. Another gripe is one line stands along the salsa bar. So youre either in someone's way or someone's in your way. Four lines is an ok concept for speed but not when you might have to get on different lines for different items. Pretty crowded on a Friday at 7 but thats good and probably because the meat is quality. Also, unlike a lot of mexican places you dont get free tortilla chips at this one. Just sayin.",

The Mexican Corn and Carne asada or carnitas vampiros were outrageous. The salsa bar?  It's a 10.   I've seen some crazy complaints on here and I'm super confused. The ordering process is pretty straightforward if you have the ability to look up AND the ability to read. It's like a casino buffet in that you go to separate counters to order different items and then hit the cash register.   And the atmosphere is fantastic. Super casual,  a lot of seating and yes there was a DJ playing music. So if you're looking for a place to bring your Nana who's hard of hearing or a place to propose to your beloved,  this would not be a good choice. Also if you're the dick who likes to talk on your phone so the rest of the restaurant is forced to listen to a one sided conversation,  blissfully this place is also not for you.   Perfect place for friends and family to chow down on delicious, affordable grub in a fun atmosphere with great extended hours.  Love me some Taco y Taco!",

It occupies that perfect space between Tacos el Gordo- authentic, gloriously affordable real non-tex-mex tacos you can't really get outside of the southwest, and Mercadito- fancier riffs on said authentic glory for a premium price.   The tacos there are SO good, and SO cheap...its easy to justify coming back again and again and again. And the fun, clean atmosphere make it easy to lure your \"Chipotle only\" friends and family into experiencing real mexican.  If you come here for the first time, do yourself a huge favor. Grow a pair. Be adventurous. Don't order the chicken. Try lengua, or suadero! You will be amazed at what you have been missing out on. The carnitas and Al pastor are pretty goddamn amazing, if you need a comfort blanket, but try something from window 2 you're not sure you'll like. At worst, you waste 2 bucks.    At best you open up a Wide and Wonderful World of Offal...   Oh, and lest I forget; Delerium Tremens on tap (you heard me, tap.) and a house Margarita that features jalapeno infused tequila. And corn! Get the corn! And the Guacamole---oh hell just go. Often.",

Every time I order my soyrizo breakfast burrito the price is always different. Half the time it is the $5.25 and the other half they say it's a specialty burrito and then it's $8.25. (There was another instance where I ordered a carne asana breakfast burrito and I was told that because I wanted carne asada it would be 8.25). I always question why I always get charged different prices and I'm always told the person before did it wrong and what they are doing is the correct way. I still love the food and I wouldn't stop coming here based on this issue alone, but I wish everyone would be on the same page with what meats (or nonmeats) are considered \"specialty\" when it comes to certain burritos.",

I've been here a few times now and each time I have a new item that wins me over. To really put the staff to the test, I recently visited on National Taco Day ($1 tacos!?!). The staff seemed prepared for the rush and were their usual efficient and friendly selves.  The tacos are so tasty and even though to get a True variety you need to wait in a couple lines, the wait isn't too bad for any one item. The tacos al pastor are sweet with an addictive kick, my favorite by far. Ingredients taste fresh and if tacos aren't your thing you can pick the meat or veggie of your dreams and throw it in a burrito, quesadilla, on nachos...the possibilities are almost endless.   Keep any eye out for specials not on the menu, usually on a tiny sign on the counter. Once advertised were the Mole Fries...my life will never be the same. Sweet potato fries, meat of your choice (get the chicken), mole sauce and cheese. I warned you....  They have a full bar but I usually can't resist the horchata. 4 stars only because I always find it to be HOT in there. I know there's good food cooking but crank up the AC a bit for us guests.

More salsas, black beans, pinto beans, grilled onions & peppers, pickled jalapeno carrots and more at no charge.  The down side is ordering. You walk up to the counter where there are 3 different lines along with another side counter to order other items. Confusing for those who are new to the place and can be a cluster.

It's like buying a Rembrandt painting and allowing a 3-year old to \"decorate\" it.   Same for mole fries. Great sweet potato fries but with way too much mole sauce and cheese. It would have been the same as putting cheese and sauce on a wet paper towel.   Service was hit or miss. Pork guy was nice, burrito/vegetarian guy was not, bartender was nice.

The decor is obviously lightyears ahead of any Tacos el Gordo locations, but I suppose that's part of it's charm... Never the less, I'd prefer to sit in a comfy, padded booth with my 5 year old vs the hard plastic ones in el Gordo.  They also do burrito bowls and the fries are never soggy here. Salsa bar is a given and a must try.",

I had the pastor (my favorite) and the carne asada. My boyfriend did the same except he also had a chicken taco. It's a lot like tacos el Gordo where you order and then get your salsas and take a seat. Everything was yummy and it wasn't overly priced but if I have to be honest it was too far and not anything that caught my attention to make me go all the way back. I've heard people rave about this place but maybe it's just because it's too far from home for me.",

The guy cutting the carne asada was wearing a black hat, glasses and had a beard. He was cooking raw carne asada and a customer asked if he was going to wash his hands before putting his chicken tacos together. Well he went to the sink, wiped his hands off with paper towels. He did not wash them. And put on gloves. Then he finished making a chicken taco. Yes he put on gloves but he still handled the outside of those gloves prior to putting them on. I would not recommend this place to anyone. On the bright side, the bartender had great customer service and was polite. (My 2 cents, I think this place needs stricter policies and a strict supervisor.)  Ps the lady behind the counter at line 4 who does the salsa and sour cream is not very attentive or nice.",

I was also disappointed that they ran out of flan too & that is why I didn't give them the 5th star. And the tables need to be cleared earlier. There was a group at a long bar table that left all of the trays on the table. I know it's a self serve place but it is unslighty. The staff didn't get to it for about a half hour or more.

You order your food at three different stations and there's even a bar on the side.  Food wise I ended up getting one al pastor and one buche taco along with a street corn. I thought the tacos were very good and liked that there was a salsa bar to grab my own limes and avocado cream sauce. The corn was good too, but it had a little too much cheese for my liking. Oh yeah and I can't forget my michelada, probably my favorite part of the meal. It was just the right amount of spice and deliciousness and only $5 during happy hour.  I can't wait to come back here again to try some different tacos. The margaritas looked great too!",

I can only imagine how hectic this system is if it were really busy.  I'm assuming if you go to the Al Pastor line and then want a taco, you'd have to go to the back of the taco line.  They have a little salsa bar in the middle of everything.  The Al Pastor is a must with pineapple!  I also got a burrito bowl with carne asada.  Unfortunately the carne asada meat was on the dry side.  I prefer Chipotle for the burrito bowl.  I say give it a try but make sure you at least get the Al Pastor and a beer along with it!",

While trying to decide on where to eat on Eastern, he remembered eating at Taco y Taco a while back. Great choice as I've always wanted to check it out.   From the outside, it looks like a cute little restaurant but once you walk through those doors, it looks pretty amazing. Definitely not your typical Mexican restaurant with what looks more like a contemporary Italian kitchen. But still very charming.   I liked that there were different stations you could order from. My husband is a meat eater. Since my last fish taco experience was amazing, I chose fish taco and soyrizo.   I thought my fish taco was just okay but my soyrizo was very good. Haven't had a bad experience yet with soyrizo.   Overall, this was a great experience - great service, great atmosphere, great prices, good food.",

With that being said, I'll echo what others say.  The ordering experience is complex with there being separate lines for ordering tacos and burritos.  And it's hard to figure out what you can get added to your taco.  Having said that, though, the carne asada tacos were good and compared favorably to the fajita tacos back home.  Also, like many taquerias back home, there's not much explanation of what's on the salsa bar, which could've used some cleanup.",

As it is, the instant you step into this place, it's very unclear what you're supposed to do to get your food.  I'm not sure how they expect people to have an enjoyable dining experience when they don't provide any clear information about what is what and how to go about ordering it. A newcomer's best bet is to just wait a minute and watch how and what more experienced people order at the counters.  But ultimately, the food is enjoyable and reasonably priced. Worth giving a try to see if you like it.",

And they have Vegan options for someone like me...which is equally amazing...I have NO complaints at all with the food...and if it werent for my experience today I would probably have gone back in a second.  First time in, we head to the counter and the man there is flirting with two cute girls, I heard them giggling and he is asking how old they are and Im like, Okkkk....That went on for about 2-3 mins and finally they moved on and I said Id like to order food to go....The guy said, oh you dont do that here, you do that in one of the lines....  I said OH--ok thanks...so I went in to a line with just 2 people ahead of me and I waited about 5 more mins and when I got to the front of the line, I was told I was in the wrong line...huh?    Yes, for tacos, nachos or burritos, its the line over there...for this and that, its the line over there and for this and this its this line....  UM...I sure wish the original guy had explained that or there were signs or something for us newbies...but alright, my frustration was growing but I got in line--Now I was here with a woman I had just met I should also add, I was there for a meeting to discuss a play I had written and she was also new there so just as confused, she even told me at the 2nd line that she didnt like the way things were set up and she was confused....  3rd line.    Person I am with gets her order in.   She tells the woman behind the counter that I am with her and also ordering, the woman nods and makes her order...Nachos with Chicken, she makes it, asks her a few questions about what she wants on them, its basically made to order...and then she gives it to her on a plate...she then helps another person and makes their tacos, the woman says again, we are together and I am ordering something and finally she helps me but get this, I order soyrizo and pinto beans-No cheese, she says...what?   No cheese....what?  No cheese?   You dont want cheese??!!??    haha, she made the nachos and looks at me again--No cheese?    haha...     Just confusing as hell.  Probably wont go back because of this, on the other hand, I understand the set up now but what if I want a taco and I want something from another line?  I have to get in 2 lines?      Ps, They are out of sour cream right now and they no longer make mole fries.   :/",

I wouldn't recommend this place. It was my first time there and when I asked the workers questions they looked at me like, 'Duh- how do you not know we don't make WET BURRITOS?'

The music and events or happy hour are still great, but the bartender, and chairs, the new guys are all bad.  The only great employees either left or have fewer schedule days.  The focus isnt on customer service anymore.  Even if I go outta my way to speak Spanish to some employees to make it easier and get my order to the tee, they still mess it up.  They start to play the young American crowd hip hop and r and b pop music instead of the strictly Spanish stuff I liked.  The food is still good and the liquor.  I enjoy the mezcal choices and the layout of the property for seating.  I dont have many complaints other than most of the new clientele are \"McDonalds\" people.  They take forever, they complain and harass the workers over trivial stuff and the lines take so long.  If people keep it moving and if the employees step their game up.

Mules are $4, and for those who don't know, it's basically a taco that gets topped with a 2nd tortilla. The tacos are 2.25. They are your typical small street size. That price isn't bad, but the tiny amount of sour cream was $1.50 for each taco. Cheese was also an extra charge. None of the meats were particularly good. The tacos weren't bad, but they also weren't great, very average. They just ended up being twice as expensive as they should have been.  The food was not worth the price, we won't be returning.",

The meats are all of top quality and juicy.  I love the sauce and beans bar.  The only item I wish I could have tried is the corn.  I'm not sure how I feel about mayo on corn, so I was a little apprehensive.    The only negative that made me not give it five stars was the ordering process.  I was quite confused as to whether or not you order at one window and just move down the line or if you had to get behind each individual line for the different meat sections.  I want to eat my food hot and not have to stand three long lines.  In fact everyone seemed quit confused.  I had my two friends stand in each line so we can have our tacos hot and not have them go cold by waiting in each line.",

We ordered tacos, street corn and carne asada fries. Everything was great, except the carne asada fries. Now please understand my husband is the type that will eat a wrong or bad meal before complaining, and we aren't the types to ever send food back. But our fries showed up the table NOT COOKED. Literally they were cold, mushy, and white. When's the last time you got served white fries?   My husband took them back to the counter and asked if they could please remake them. Over 10 minutes later they brought THE SAME box of fries back and this is what the waitress told us... \"I'm sorry, but my manager said this is how are fries are made and they will be the same if we remake them. He said to tell you that we just changed the oil two days ago so even if we cooked them for 30 minutes, they'd still be the same color\". I told her I'm really sorry, but your manager is wrong, and clearly doesn't know what he or she is talking about, and not to mention this is terrible customer service. I told her I wanted new fries or our money back as those were not edible.   She took them back and about five minutes later a really nice young man walked up. I fully expected him to be the manager, but he was a cashier. He told us he'd get us a refund, apologized for the poor service and agreed we were correct and the manager was wrong! Another ten minutes, a conversation at the cash register about our fries amongst staff and we finally got our money back. I told the nice young man to let his manager know I'd be calling THEIR boss. He very sweetly gave me the number to call and said please do. I've not called yet, but I plan to. I'm a business owner and if one of my staff treated a customer that way, they would be promptly unemployed. While the customer may not always be right, your fries should never be white... Shame shame Taco Y Taco. Not worth the drive to be served undercooked food and treated TERRIBLY",

By the way, you do actually have something to do with postmates because my money went to you for the order, hence you doing business with post mates and as well the person who orders the food, Catherine.",

    "text": "After watching everyone check in here, I had to try it for myself. This is not your typical american mexican restaurant but rather it is designed to be an authentic taqueria.  Set up with stations where you can get al pastor, tacos, burritos, and specialty items, you get your tray, pick your items, some are warmed up right in front of you, and then pay per item.  The items are reasonably priced with the average taco priced around $2.25.  It is served up cafeteria style, meaning the food is already preprepared and only a little warming up on the griddle is necessary.  I expected the food to be dried out having been premade but it was surprisingly tender and moist. There are TV's around the room so you don't miss the big game.  There is a small bar as well.  The staff is friendly but to be honest, I could barely understand what the servers were offering me.  It is a good idea to know what the different foods names are before you go in, or speak spanish.  Still, I enjoyed everything I tried and will be back.",

Fries covered in shredded cheese, guacamole and tomatoes. The lady taking my order had the cook come over so I could tell him exactly what I wanted. He was very nice and made it just the way I asked. My Mom had a carne asada taco and she said it was good, but they fry the tortilla and she said it was greasy. My favorite thing is the salsa bar they have. So many things to choose from.

It's a really spacious restaurant, it gets super hectic on weekends but the line always moves fast and I've never had trouble finding a place to sit.  My go to tacos are al pastor, the fresh pineapple on top and avocado crema is out of this world. I always get elote as well, you can never have too much queso fresco. I've actually never had a bad taco from here. If you're feeling adventurous the lengua and beef stomach tacos are amazing.  For drinks I either get horchata or a margarita. There's nothing special about the margarita, drink service is fast. Their horchata is really good but I can't drink more than a glass because of how sweet it is.  Their salsa bar has a wide selection of salsas, as well as having black and pinto beans and fresh veggies. I always load up on radishes and cucumbers.",

We went to Taco Y Taco three times in a span of 1 week. This place is that good. The prices are much better than taco El Gordo and also less crazy (compared to the location on the strip). The Al pastor fries and Al pastor tacos are perfect. My wife loved her chicken taco and the chips/salsa. The food is so affordable but great quality, I am already looking forward to the next time I'm Vegas just so I can stop in and eat at Taco Y Taco.",

I will say the way they have their ordering system is confusing and seems alittle anti customer service for me.  They have 4 different lines.  1 For Al Pastor tacos 1 for Carne asada chicken and chorizo tacos 1 for tacos with one of the other 8 items.  Then another line for everything else.  And if that's not bad enough then there's another line to pay.   Not sure why for the life of me only 1 register was open out of 2.  At one point there was 9 to 10 people in line to pay.  Now for the food..  Oh my it was good.  We has a Carntas Bowl.  Mexical street corn.  And Carne Asada, Carnitas, Al Pastor, Barbacoa and Chorizo  Tacos.  It was all flavorful and great.  Corn could have used a bit more mayo on it but it was good.  Best part you can enjoy a drink from the bar.  We had some beers.  Over all this place is great.  Turn offs happy hours doesn't start till 5pm.  And just poor ordering system.  I say try it out.  I will be back for sure.",

Street style tacos with everything - onions, cilantro, and salsa are where it's at! Although you can get burritos, tostadas, too.   I went for carnitas, my favorite, and they did not disappoint! Juicy, crispy on the outside, and packed full of flavor.   And let's have a moment of silence for the Mexican street style corn. .............

    "text": "I decided to celebrate \"National Taco Day\" with a tasting of sorts at Taco y Taco. Unfortunately, the results were decidedly mixed.  October 4th is one of those so-called holidays dedicated to a specific food, and this restaurant decided to celebrate it by offering all non-seafood tacos for $1.00 (normal price $2.25). Having eaten a lot of tacos at other places since my previous review, I approached this as an opportunity to try a multitude of the meats available here. The lone exception was the reasonably tasty carnitas (tender pork) because I'd eaten my fair share of those on their Mexican Independence Day celebration at the OG Taco y Taco. I would have skipped the al pastor also if my friend hadn't gotten too full too quickly.  I actually went here for both lunch and dinner, which was necessary for me to have the stomach space for everything. I was going to describe the two meals separately, but I'll list what I ate from the best to the worst (with line breaks to separate tiers). Note that not all of the options will be appealing to all palates.  ==========  - Buche (pork stomach): probably the best rendition that I've eaten, bursting with flavor and juices.  - Tripas (beef intestine): about as strongly flavored as any tripas I've had here or anywhere else. - Barbacoa (tender beef): I wonder if this has the fatty bits that are normally served with cabeza. It was pretty good overall, and I'd order it again. - Al pastor (marinated pork): flavorful, but still not as good as one particular local taco stand. It's still pretty good, although the pineapple was a bit too acidic. - Cesos (beef brain): distinguished by the almost creamy texture, and no sign of prions so far.  - Cochinita pibil (roasted/marinated pork): tasty marinade, but too chewy. - Chicharron (pork rinds): this actually lacked the crunchy stuff that my friend reports usually getting when ordering it, so it was just a rather spicy, marinated, and overall intensely flavored pork. It packs a punch that I'm not that interested in.  - Pollo (chicken): surprisingly good, but chicken isn't that unique naturally, there wasn't a special marinade to lend any flavor, and most people go to taco places for beef and pork, not chicken. - Carne asada (grilled/marinated beef steak): pretty good, but not as impressive as what I've had elsewhere in Vegas. - Chorizo (pork sausage): served as finely ground meat instead of as a cut sausage, so the texture was disappointing. The flavor was average at best.  - Lengua (beef tongue): significantly tougher to chew than it should be, suggesting that it's been overcooked or wasn't cut properly. - Cabeza (head meat): boring compared to past experiences with this meat, seemed to lack all the fatty bits that provide flavor and typically make it a can't-miss option. - Suadero (a beef cut from near the udder): the one I was served was simply too dry and chewy.  ==========  In addition to the unfortunate issues in various meats, I found another problem. By the time I had seated myself and readied myself to eat the tacos, I found that the tacos as a whole were merely warm and approaching lukewarm. Yep, on both visits.  I think this happened because of the inherently flawed ordering/paying system: they'll prep the food first, then you'll most likely have to wait to pay (I did wait, twice), then you'll spend more time filling beverages and obtaining lime wedges, salsas, etc., and finally you get to sit down and start to eat. My currently preferred taco joints in town ask you to pay first, then allow you to do other things while waiting for the tacos. When the tacos are ready at these places, you'll be done with all of the other time-consuming tasks, so the tacos won't be too cold. As with most foods, tacos simply don't taste as good after they've cooled down.  By the way, I'm still not cool with the prices for the standard meats being that higher than the standard $2.00. What's next, a bump to $2.50? Let's hope not.  I saw too many flaws today. I'm no longer comfortable with giving Taco y Taco anything more than a 3-star rating. I've already been reluctant to return, and based on my observations, I'll continue to limit my visits here to sales (holiday promos, happy hours or Taco Tuesdays) and occasional invitations by friends.",

I tried to ask the cashier but she just walked 10' away and ignored me.  I went to line 1 hoping to ask but the other customers were pushing around between the lines trying to order.  I was bumped into a couple times as people pushed in front of me - I gave up and left.  On my second attempt I was set on tacos and waited patiently in line 1.  When it was my turn a customer from line 3 walked over, put his hand on my chest and forcibly shoved me backwards as he started ordering.  I looked at the employee who just shrugged and served the a**hole.  I guess this is standard behavior for Taco Y Taco.  I gotta wonder, with all the pushing & shoving, has this place had problems with fights breaking out?  No taco, not even the best shrimp burrito, is worth putting up with this behavior.",

Now, I have heard about this place from other people. I've seen the beautiful pictures of elote (corn smothered in butter, cheese and spices). But sadly, the food did not taste as good as it looked in the photos.   FOOD: We had the chorizo taco, carne asada taco and elote. The chorizo taco was extremely salty, so I do not recommend this for anyone. The carne asada was dry, did not taste fresh at all. Even adding some sauces to the mix did not make the tacos tastier. The elote was okay. They smothered it in butter mix, sprinkled some cheese on it and chili powder. There was something missing in the elote, For sure it was the best thing in my meal, but I would not come back to try again.   PRICE: I felt like it was overpriced for the quality of food I got. For two people, it came out to $25. I should've driven farther to enjoy El Gordo's instead or even Roberto's.   SERVICE: Service was okay. The people were nice and they gave me what I ordered within a timely manner.   I give this place a 2-star. If you come here, I would recommend getting the elote, but don't expect a life-changing experience.   Happy Dining,   J Tran",

Normally I can't get avocado because it's always mixed with tomatoes and onions, which I hate, but here you have the option to just add the avocado. The design is amazing, doesn't look anything like a taco place. And they have modelo on draught. Awesome place.",

    "text": "Since I moved to Las Vegas about 6 years ago I have tried out so many Mexican restaurants ranging from chained ones Roberto's,Fausto's, and Don Tortaco off the strip to ones on the strip like Javier's,Cabo Wabo, and Pink Taco.I have been to some of the best Mexican in Southern California that it has to offer to the best of Phoenix and San Antonio.I have tried out many Mexican food on wheels in a trailer all over as well but Taco Y Taco is right up there at the top with the best.  Tonight I went in and tried out many of the different meats and for a second I thought I was in heaven just like the first time I tried out Texas De Brazil. The El Pastor is very good and delicious so I had to order 2 tacos to go of that meat. The next meat I tried was the Pibil and I was just blown away with the flavor so I got me 2 of those tacos to go as well. Lastly I wanted to test out the chips so I ordered me some Nachos with those 2 meats tried out.They have a huge salsa bar which has many flavors from mild to very hot but just a great variety.  When I got home and tried out everything I ordered I can say I was very pleased and impressed with how everything tasted.Anyone who loves good Mexican food will appreciate this restaurant and needs to give it a try.I will go out on a limb here and say this place beats many of the restaurants in Las Vegas.   Don't sleep on this restaurant!!!",

I will never understand why this place has three separate lines for different foods and then a checkout line. If they fixed that I would be in here every week! And make a kids menu!! Bean burritos and quesadillas at the least!  I hate paying $8 for each of kids to have a bean burrito! Food is great though, just don't go during a busy time or you will leave there so annoyed!",

Also one of the few places you can get mexican style street corn (covered in mayo?, spices, and cheese), and to top it off they have some really bomb horchatta at the drink station. As an added bonus they are also open late on weekends and serve a vareity of beer and liquor.",

    "text": "I really like the meat selection at taco y taco.   Surprisingly enough my favorite tacos are suadero, cabeza, and lengua and they do a pretty good job at making these meats.  The flavors are really great and shine through the fat (which I'll admit there is a lot of.)  I like the little salsa bar because I feel like I'm getting a good amount of other stuff for free.  There's not just salsa and pickled and roasted jalapenos but there are two kinds of beans (usually) as well.  The tacos themselves aren't that expensive starting at $2.25 for it's a very reasonable deal.  The one major major major gripe I have with this place is that I hate how you order especially if it's busy.  You stand in different lines for different kinds of tacos and then you stand in line to pay.  By the time you sit down your taco is cold and soggy.   But they still get a 4 based on how tasty these tacos are and how much I like coming to this location (lots of seating and always clean. )",

    "text": "Finally there's a place serving good street tacos south of Tropicana Ave to bad it's not on the West.  Well I gave the original location a 5 star cause I loved it so Im gonna give this location an extra star cause I love it even more. Yes an extra star, 6 stars, so what its a 5 star rating system. When they decide to open one near me I'll probably give them another star too LOL. It's the same awesome food as the original location, maybe a few more options on the menu, but in a larger, fancier, and better place.  There's lots of meat choices. If you're having trouble selecting which meat you want just ask they'll gladly explain or let you sample, free food sample them all haha. A must is Al Pastor with everything on it and extra pineapple. Al Pastor is a spicy marinated pork that's been roasting on a spit, take it like how they serve it or let them know how you like it, I like a little more crunchy then normal. There's 12 different meats :) I've had them all at the other location but one that I didn't see  was the cochinita pibil so I had to sample it, delicious I need to have it again. The meats can be put in a taco, burrito, bowl, fries, nachos, and as a vampiro then you can go to their condiments area and load up on their various sauces and sides. Warning the sauces aren't labeled but if its like the original location there's a habanero sauce in the mix its probably orange, try them all and buy a drink. Ask for fried green onions and peppers if there aren't any at the condiment area.  There's a vegetarian menu also which you can put in a taco, burrito, bowl, or the other options like the meats. There's the Seta which is a mushroom and chile pasilla mix with queso fresco, the Soyrizo which is a soy chorizo, the Queso Fresco which is a smooth pasteurized cheese, and the Vegetables which is fajita mixed style with green and yellow bell peppers and purple onions. Reading of the menu.  I got the Al Pastor, Lengua (tongue), and Carnintas (shoulder) tacos and even an Al Pastor fries with everything on all of it. Everything was very delicious as I remembered from the original location.   There's a lot of dining room both downstairs and upstairs, it seems more private upstairs and with a view of downstairs. They serve cocktails and beers. Happy Hour is 6pm-8pm daily, Brunch 11am-3pm Sat and Sun, Live Mariachi 6pm-7pm Mon, and DJ Fri-Sun. I don't know what the deals or menus are but noticed them on a flyer on my way out.  OK I'll comply to the 5 stars rating system for now. Still the best in town just saying.",

Totally looks like a bar or lounge rather than a taco restaurant.   By far, I've tried two different meats for the tacos. The al pastor and tripas. I also tried both on flour and corn tortilla. I'm more of a flour tortilla person so my preference still lies there. Between the two meats, the tripas is probably my favorite. I like the al pastor but honestly think it's a little overrated. I also asked for everything BUT pineapples both times I went but somehow still ended up with pineapples on top. Meh. The tripas was amazing. If you get it, ask them to deep fry it a little. It comes out so crunchy and adds way more texture (since tripe has such a weird bite to begin with).   I also had the mexican style corn. Yum yum yum! They make it right in front of you so you could ask for extra stuff if ya want. I like mine super cheesy! My friends also got the mole fries and al pastor fries. I wasn't a fan of the mole fries. The sauce was already sweet... drenched over sweet potato fries made it a bit too much. The al pastor fries were decent as well. Fries were chunky but a little soggy - probably because it was drenched in meat and other sauces. They were good but I probably would never order them for myself.  Another reason I love this place is the availability of seating! The place is huge! There's a seating area upstairs that accomodated myself and 8 other friends. Can't beat that!",

It was very fancy inside but had everything we could want after traveling from Islip to Baltimore to Raleigh to Vegas with snow, delays, wind, and no food.  Open late every night (til 11 Sundays), this was the perfect place for Eric R.'s taco craving and my desire to eat lengua!  There was a lady dressed in sequins helping me understand how to navigate the new layout, and she was very nice!  I asked her a few questions about menu items since I typically just get tacos.  I ended up getting one lengua taco and one vampiro - 2 tostadas with melted cheese stuffed with lengua, onion, cilantro, and salsa...sooooo goooood.  We also got a side of guac to share.  Eric R. got the barbacoa burrito, but he thinks he got carne asada instead.  The salsa bar was fully stocked and we munched our way into oblivion...okay I mean happiness.  Overall, for affordable late night eats, this is a great option!",

The newest location is only minutes from our home... which might be dangerous, but we're thrilled to welcome TyT to the neighborhood.  We went opening day just before the dinner rush. We got our usual order and a couple modelos. They'll soon have a large draft selection available too. I was a little concerned it wouldn't be as tasty as the original location, but I had no need to worry. Everything was delicious!!  The new space is modern, large and clean. They can accommodate large groups and big crowds. I do wonder if ordering will get congested during peak times, like how the original location bottle necks, but this one is more open so it might be ok. Whatever the case, it's worth the wait.",

They should put some signs up for first timers.   I ended up getting 3 tacos the Al pastor and 2 lengua tacos. The Al pastor taco was okay not my favorite. However, they have the best Mexican style corn. I highly recommend trying it if you want some legit Mexican corn.",

The biggest downside is the set up. Getting the tacos is the easiest part and the fastest but after that, the wait for anything else such as burritos, fries, nachos, etc., is pretty long. If they switched the setup, I think it would be way more efficient.  Price wise- it's pretty fair. About $2 a taco and about $7 for a burrito. So definitely nothing crazy!",

A customer shouldn't have to ask to get a table wiped off 3 times especially when the venue was not busy.   Tried the following:  Lengua Vamprio (Lengua: Beef tongue) Really enjoyed this.  Taco Tuesday regular Chicken taco special. Onions or something on there was way too hot.  Pibil: Marinated pork wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted. Really enjoyed this.

Upon opening my carne asada tacos I find out they are ICE COLD, as if the meat was in the fridge.   My wife politely brought this information up to the cashier. The cashier than said \" didn't you get these to go?\"   My wife said \"yes but they are cold. We would like them to be warm\" neither of us realized that to go food was supposed to be served at a cold temp. Who knew?   Then the woman came out from the back and said you ordered these to go over 10 minutes ago (it was 5 minutes max) and said there was nothing she could do about fixing the problem.   So for the 3 $2.25 street tacos, they now lost us as customers. I am happy to also tell everyone about the shitty service and cashier that was working today 6/12/17 at 1pm.  If management or the owner of taco y taco reads this, I hope you get a better service staff or you will continue to lose customers for cold meat and a horrible staff.",

    "text": "This is my go to spot for Mexican street tacos. I have to show some restraint every time I come here. On multiple occasions I've put away double digit tacos. If you're able, coming here at non peak times is your best bet, because it can get crowded in the parking lot and in the restaurant lines. Having some taco eating partners to stand in separate lines and order will also make life a little easier for you.  If you'd like to get away from the standard chicken and carne asada (which is still good also), this is the place to do it. There are so many different types of meat that are sliced fresh and put onto your corn tortilla and topped with mainly onion, cilantro, and guacamole. With the pineapple, the al pastor is great and not found in every taco shop. I also like the lengua, cabeza, chorizo, and adobada. If you need a little crunch, you can sandwich the meat and cheese between two tortillas to make a vampiro.  The salsa station and the bar is what sets Taco Y Taco apart from the others. There are so many side items and salsa and you're sure to find a combination that works for you. You name it, spicy, mild, radishes, beans, pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc. And what goes best with your tacos? How about a Modelo or a margarita? There's plenty of room in the restaurant including tables upstairs once you get your food.  Each taco will set you back two dollars and change. They also have a pretty decent happy hour. Don't give up on the place if you get frustrated, because once you get the ordering down, there's so much to discover and try.",

Then you wait for a few minutes, sometimes longer when people are confused and start cutting into your line, you order your food and they prepare it right in front of you. You then place it on your tray and as you walk towards the register you pick up some elotes from the corn guy and maybe some chips. Then you pay, then walk to your table and blissfully scarf down that great adobada meat.",

The most recent time, however, I actually walked out never having ordered and pissed off because after being offered assistance by the employee to make my food, I step up to the counter and then he says \"hold on\" and just helps someone else instead.

If you ask me if I might come back to this place but then again I probably would come with a lot more people I think this place had charm because the space can accommodate a lot of people. I could see eating here after a night of drinking and just taking with your friends and hanging out while enjoying some cheap tacos! oh btw I love the salsa bar...so many different kinds can't wait to try some more.",

Until this visit I thought they were ok, about 3-4 stars.... But they just secured that final star and I'm so glad I waited to review.   First my only real complaint from the first few visits was that it was really difficult to find out what kind of meat I was getting on my tacos. I'm allergic to pork, I know, I know The Horror! Anyway, my pork allergy puts me on edge when I don't feel confident the cooks understand what I mean by \"I do not want any pork!\"   I had been complaining to my bf that if only they could update the signs to show what kind of meat.... And low and behold they did! Yay! It is was less stressful for me to order and try new things now.   We decided to sit at the bar, and what a treat! The bar is small so if you ever get the opportunity, I say grab it! The bartender (completely forgot his name - cute young, hipsterish kinda guy) is awesome. He's fun, friendly and very funny. He made me this delicious pumpkin pie shot... Yum! Consider me converted.",

The asada tacos, well I bet you can't just have one! I always get the elote with everything, and you must try one of their micheladas. Oh and be careful cause they are spicy!! Also make sure you try the grilled onions and peppers they have at the bar with all the hot sauces. I would also say try every taco. I think they are all good. Love that it's quick and cheap too! They have a full bar and have a Dj on some nights! Cool spot to hang. They have an upstairs seating area as well as outside seating. Definitely a spot to try.",

Monday night & it felt like it was a weekend party Fiesta ahahhaahah.... came here with an infant which was probably not a good idea because it scared the crap out of the little one... they are quite loud so Mommys maybe bring some ear muffs for them or something.   The interior had high ceilings & everything seemed very spacious lyrics spread out for seating with booths towards the entrance & hightops on the sides with tables in the center. There are different stations to order your food from which reminds me of cafeteria style. Clean & neat salsa condiment bar in the center of the room.  All the employees were very helpful.... especially when we looked like lost 9th graders that enter a high school cafeteria for the first time!  Each station is labeled with different kinds of items such as mulas & tacos... burritos & seafood.... gran tacos & sides The service here is fast & everything is made before your eyes then you slide to the next station or the register if you are done receiving your food.  MULAS - pretty much a taco sandwich made from flour tortilla instead of corn. I like it with the extra cheesyness  & the softness of the flour tortilla.  CARNE ASADA TACO - this is a small taco like two bites & done   QUESO FRESCO GRAN TACO - vegetarian selection, but the Gran Taco is the typical taco size with the cheese melted between the 2 tortillas   CORN ON A STICK - that mexican street corn lathered in the butter & drenched with cheese... they are definately not shy with the cheese which I believe is the best part of mexican food!  CHIPS & GUACAMOLE - love the chips since they are made there & the guacamole full of flavor  JIMAICA DRINK - this is HONESTLY the best JIMAICA juice that comes closest to the ones that my BOH kitchen coworkers used to make it when they brought the dried plant back from mexico! Dark colored and BLAST of flavor!  The salsa bar is one major thing that will probably keep me coming back over & over ahahaha",

    "text": "Being that it was my first time here I, like most people was hit with confused stick! If you happen to go when it's packed and there are a hundred people standing around in a crowd in front of all the lines you might not know what to do. But when there's no one, it's kind of easy to make sense of it all.   Ok here's how it works so there are 3 main lines but basically it's like one big line where you get to choose from a list of different meats in different style in each like. You let the guys know how much of what you want and how you want it. For instance the 1st line served up Alpastor right off of the spinner in a taco, tostada or vampiro style. The 2nd line has your more unique choices like chicharron chili or tripas (my favorite) and the 3rd line us your Asada, carnitas etc. and the main 4th line has everything you want to order, burritos, Asada fries, nachos quesadilla, Elote and more.   They also have a full bar and on most days a live DJ spinning some top tunes or edm which makes for hanging out and eating great tacos fun and entertaining. There are 2 stories at this locations and a sweet open outdoor patio. The tacos are absolutely worth it. About $2.50 a taco the price can add up quick. Stick to the tacos. They are small and you can't go wrong with any choice of meat. I like the Vampiro style meaning(your choice of meat sandwich in between 2 fried tortilla with melted cheese and mango salsa) it's good but nothing beats the classic little soft corn tortilla with all the toppings. Just the way I like my street tacos with the cilantro, onions and whatever other goodness they top it with.   I tried the Mole fries with regular not sweet potato fries and it wasn't my favorite I think it was the mole. Not bad just too sweet for me it was weird all around I think. They have this salsa bar with so much to choose from and plus they got cooked whole beans all for free. The chips were in house made chips for sure. They were crunchy, crispy salted and warm. The Elote was ok I lexpected a lot more flavor but it was just slightly sweeten and the mayo, cheese & chili didn't do much. But it was still pretty good. The tacos were all dreaming bomb dot com. Not crazy about the Alpastor Vampiro I got but the meat itself was juicy and fatty and full of flavor.   Such good tacos such cool atmosphere and now that I know how to order I can't wait to come back.",

The service from the taco guys is superb. They're always busy but always so kind and helpful 5stars for them! The food is pretty good actually and the prices are a little high for tacos but I understand quality over quantity. So I don't mind, the price 4stars. BUT the check out service is AWFUL. My mistake is tipping for bad service. I don't like not tipping because I like beer money too. The cashiers and the lady that helps at the corn section get 1 star because 0 isn't an option. I have NEVER had such awful service. The front counter is my least favorite they're always rude and act as if they hate their jobs you can hear it, see it, AND feel it. I've been in food for 10years I know service can get hard and frustrating I get it we have bad days. I've kept going because for the most part it's a decent experience. After the last time though I will definitely start looking for a new spot. It's just to bad because I love the taco guys!",

The estimated wait was 45 minutes for 12 orders. Once I arrived, everything was ready and neatly bagged. Guadalupe promptly greeted me and helped me out to my car with the bags. There she reviewed all items on my order, and when she realized one of my bowls had been made as a burrito, she insisted on making it right. She did an excellent job. One point of comment, at the salsa bar there were no lids for the salsa cups, and the spicy carrots seemed like they had been out for a while, but aside from that everything went very well. I ordered a carnitas bowl with everything, and absolutely loved it. The meat was tender with a little crispiness, the guacamole was very fresh, with large chunks of tomato, and one of the salsas was labeled hot, but it seemed pretty mild. Very filling, and very satisfying.",

The prices are definitely fair considering the quality of the food. I can see myself coming back for sure.   I started with a few street tacos with different meats just to get a taste. I instantly ordered fries with 2 meats after tasting the carne asada and el pastor... The meat was super soft and flavorful.  ** Here's a little YELP tip...try the horchata, you will not be disappointed**",

I also tasted the chicken and the meat was bad. Turned me off so I got a veggie quesadilla was ok. 1 star for food, 4 for service. They need to come up with a better plan here and the fact you have to buy a while box of chips when I only want one serving. Like 5 bucks. Come on ridiculous and the fact they charged me after I wasn't even going to eat was a little annoying(for the chips)i mean come on i came for dinner right after The gym. I needed protein. The bartender was rude but the lady handling the register was super nice. Thanks probably won't be back. 3rd time trying them out. Hey I gave it a chance",

Based on the reviews and ratings we decided to give it a try. There was 15 people in our party and luckily there was enough room for all of us. As we were checking out the menu, the owner (I think) came out and told us if we wanted to try any meat to ask the staff, which was great from her part. The food was AMAZING and the staff as well. It was so good that we went two days in a row and let me say this is going to be the spot we go to every time we are in Las Vegas. Thank you Taco y Taco....two thumbs up!!!",

The way you order and pay in separate lines for different items is wacky!! The music is loud...  Suck it up, your not here for service, or to feel especially welcome. Your here for tacos, and that's what they deliver.  I only had two (plus nachos, waste of time). The pastor was great, a little heavy handed with the pineapple salsa. But I won't ask them to change a thing for me. The carnitas tacos were dressed entirely different than the pastor, and just as bold and delicious. The salsa bar may take me 5 more vists to really get into, cause the tacos are so right, I don't need any salsa. The pickled veggies in several varieties is worth a run. The nachos were ok.. If the tacos weren't so good, I'd have liked them more. I realized i cheated myself out of an additional taco by having them.  Short version: Definitely coming back.  It will be loud, ordering won't make sense; the staff will try (in vein) to make it seem that this all makes sense to them, but I won't care. I'm not here for order, or quiet. Keep your eye on the prize... I'm here for the tacos. Taco y Taco",

    "text": "I have been living in Las Vegas now for 1.5 years. One thing that is very apparent is the competition in the trendy restaurant business. We have so many choices and the one thing they should all have a heightened awareness of is consistency, quality and outstanding, superior customer service.  Customer service is the one characteristic alone that we all know brings repeat business to a restaurant. This place certainly gives you a feeling of uncertainty.    I never write reviews about restaurants but rather give my opinion by word of mouth.  To me it holds more value to personally tell someone an experience, there is a loss of interpretation from reading about it, however my experience at this place was totally beyond unacceptable.  So I had to create this account with YELP just so I could tell the public what a lousy, unfriendly, confusing experience I had.  1 )  First impression After seeing the hand written sign in the window and waiting for months to try this place I am so disappointed I in my experience. When you walk in to the place there is no sense of direction as to where to start, where to order and no one to greet you or answer questions. Everyone is meandering around trying to figure out how to order their food, one customer asking another do I do?? If they wanted to convey the sense of wandering the streets of a foreign country with street vendors selling food; well they definitely accomplished their goal. I felt like I was at the Swap Meet in North Las Vegas. You have to be a leader and form your own line or be the one to tell everyone else what they have to do to order food, after 5 -10 minutes of deciphering the menu boards that are hung behind the cooks   2)  The Food  The tacos were below standard in taste. I had to try 2 of each and the flavors all blended together. There were no real distinct flavors between any of the meets except the Chorizo, it was ok but they are all very small.  I would have been much happier going to Super Burrito than to eat the greasy bland tacos at this place. .  A specialty dish Mole Smothered Fries was displayed with a 8x11 piece of paper, hand written with No Price, and no direction as to who takes the order. I inquired about the special to the closet server to the sign and he had to go ask someone else, he said What Special?? Finally a different server asks me what I needed so I had to repeat myself and he had to get someone else to get it. I did not have a good feeling about what I was going to get since they did not even know about the special. Needless to say it was the worst Mole I ever tasted and had enough salt in it to last me a month. 3) Customer Service & Price So after eating some of the tacos and smothered fries I bought, I needed another beer. So I looked at my receipt and discovered I was charged $7.00 for a draft beer. I asked the cashier was there a mistake and she had to ask the bartender, he confirmed it was $7. he also said the bottle beer was $3.00 and it was happy hour. Well no one told me it was happy hour and it was not posted for anyone to see. But the one thing that was startling to me was that in the whole beer drinking world the normal Tap Beer  is served at happy hour prices.  So I ask for the manager and an insensitive young lady struts over to my table with an attitude and from her introduction has no manager or professional business skill to begin with.  I explained to her what the situation was and she walked away to reprint my receipt she returned only to reiterate what I already knew.  There was no apology for the lack of customer service from the cashiers not telling people it was happy hour and bottle beer was cheaper. There was no empathy but rather a unprofessional arrogant attitude.   If I would have experienced one shred of concern or a slight sense or knowledge of customer service from anyone in that Tacos Y Tacos I probably never would have written this review. Yes it's fresh and it is grilled, but there is also Fresh and Crappy taste and service which this place exemplifies!!   I am very familiar with excellent customer service and this place has failed to produce that quality and I will never go back, there is no value to what they serve.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review after my second (and last) visit. I'm from SF, so pardon me for expecting authentic street Mexican tacos & burritos. The first burrito I got from them was late at night on the way home from driving back from SF... perhaps it was close to closing time, so the reason the food was so salty and dry was because it was late and it had been sitting? The burrito was salty as hell, with no real freshness to any of the flavors. My second visit, I was on my way driving out to SF, around noon. I ordered a burrito again (easier to eat in the car). I ordered pork as the meat (which - btw the meat options for burritos are not clearly laid out on the menus - if you want a meat option they offer for the tacos, you have to look over at the taco line menus and specifically ask for it)... they offer \"cilantro-style\" rice (which - if I wanted that, I'd just patronize Chipotle) and Spanish style rice, and all the other standard burrito ingredients... but I'm pretty sure every single ingredient they have, rice, guac, pico, beans, meat, all have added salt in each. I could practically feel my skin shrivel in the desert dryness and my blood pressure rise to 180/90 about half way through my burrito. The worst part: the pork was so dehydrated and dead, they might as well have thrown shredded beef jerky in there and called it a day. Also, the burrito was pinner, and it was TEN BUCKS.",

Everyone keeps talking about how it's \"authentic\" Mexican food.  If authentic Mexican food is just cooked meat, then yes, that's correct.  But there is nothing special about it.  There was meat and salsa on small tortillas and one burnt tostada shell.  That's it.  Granted, I could have probably had them add other stuff to this, but unfortunately, as you have read in the other reviews, you have to stand in line for everything you want and that includes just wanting a little cheese.  After 5 minutes of the guy building some nachos and discussing family member and how great the restaurant was, I gave up and decided to forego the cheese.  Seriously, is this a challenge to see how many lines you can force me to stand in before I just give up?  They really need to read these reviews and make some adjustments or they are going to be like half the other restaurants on Eastern and be gone within a few months.",

We paid ($36) for a family of four and took our seats. Excellent food. Not a single person in our party had anything negative to say about the food. The handmade tortillas were amazing! Had to go back for a few more tacos after I finished my first three. Great atmosphere (a little loud but if you sit closer to the door it seems to be quieter), very clean, and fun place to have a casual dinner. Also, because today was Mother's Day, all moms received a free drink (Mimosa, glass of wine, Horchata, or soda). I'll be back for sure as there is many more items I want to try!",

The only this is- the set up to order is so weird. You have to be in 4 different lines to order 4 different things. The tacos gets cold if you wait in line and in another one, and in another one, and in another one.   I'll visit this place more oftn when I crave some berrrrrrrrey good tacos!",

I came today for a friend's birthday and while the soychorizo was good, their tortillas don't taste good. Something about them -I can't quite place my finger on what's missing. But my main complaint is service. I get they get busy but that is not excuse for lack of customer service. I had told the bigger guy behind the counter that I wanted 3 vegetarian tacos expecting him to ask which ones. And when he started putting all vegetables on my tacos, I told him I actually wanted soychorizo for my other tacos and he was rude about it, gave me some attitude. My bad- I didn't know 3 vegetarian tacos meant 3 grilled vegetable tacos when the vegetarian menu lists 4 other options. When I came up to ask for a water cup later, he just stared at me and didn't offer any help. Don't think I'll be coming back. Also we weren't told there was a reservation upstairs at 7:30 and there was 20 so the party that reserved it came up and kicked us out at 6:50pm.",

I have had the fish burrito and al Pastor burrito.    I read reviews that the lines are a little confusing, which is True but really?! Would luv to have this place in AZ!  Hard working employees and a great small business!!",

    "text": "Mexican food is delicious and my lunch decision for today. This is my first trip here, so if one has never been here there is a trick to ordering.   When you walk in the atmosphere of this taco establishment takes me back to the days of when I did field research in Oaxaca, Mexico. Plus all of the staff understands Spanish. Its lucky that I abalone some. At least enough to order.   I love this place everything is so quaint and welcoming. What a wonderful concept for this restaurant. Now I know why they are so busy!   I figured it out fast that I wanted line/counter four since this is where I would order the type of protein that I wanted for the tacos.    As I watched the cook, through the smoke haze place steak on the grill my old factory senses just went haywire. The smells that danced in my head as the smoke rose from the steak. The cook was very comfortable with his position and cut the steak flawlessly. I only wanted cilantro as a topping; this trip.  When I followed the line around to the last counter I also ordered an ear of corn loaded minus the mayo. Having never experienced mayo on the corn I passed this trip.   When I took that first bite of the corn the red chili peppers just fill your mouth with so much flavor. The corn was cooked perfectly too. The iced cold beer is the only thing that can break the burning pain from the chili powder on top of the corn. It's splendid burning bliss.  The staff here are amazing and very knowledgeable about the menu. The authenticity that has gone into the menu and restaurant experience is so wonderful. The way the guest orders their food is so exceptional; since the individual gets to interact with the kitchen staff, even if it's through a window.   I will be coming back for some more steak tacos, plus they serve burritos here that I have yet to enjoy! Can't wait! Plus they serve beer and wine which is a must for any Mexican food",

What bothers me, and frequently causes utter chaos, is the fact that it is cafeteria style dinning. There are different stations for different items, and also the line to pay. The problem with this is, I could wait 10 minutes in line to get some street tacos, finally get them, and go get in line for a burrito and wait another 10 minutes, now my tacos are cold and by the time I'm through the pay line, everything might be cold. I don't know how they could fix this problem, but something should be done because the food is outstanding!!! Maybe doubling or tripling up the amount of workers at each station could help, but could also possibly just add to the chaos! A shame, because I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for these issues! I would drive 4-9 miles for this restaurant. If it wasn't for the cafe style service, I would increase that to 17-22 miles, it is that tasty!",

    "text": "I'm a sucker for Mexican food. While I don't particularly have a favorite Mexican restaurant, Taco Y Taco is definitely on my top 5. The place can be a bit confusing for first timers, but there are separate lines depending on what meat and type of item you are wanting to order. I always get the fries with cabeza (meat from the head of the animal, typically beef). They have a wide arrange of meat and parts to choose from and my first time I was very hesitant to try beef head and beef tongue (lengua), but both were extremely delicious and literally melt in your mouth. I would HIGHLY recommend getting cabeza fries fully loaded (sour cream, guacamole, cheese, pico) and head over to the sauce bar and get some hot sauce. As for the lengua, I would definitely go for tacos for them and go to the sauce bar for their avocado dressing. Only reason for the 4 stars is because this place is inconvenient when trying to get to and the place isn't as clean.  The good:  +Price for the amount of food you get is top notch +Quality of the meat is great and fresh +Place is very vibrant +Employees work as a team and keep the food consistent even when it's busy +Unique selection on types of meats and body parts  The bad:  -Can be confusing to order for first timers -Can be confusing what meat is what for first timers -Location is inconvenient to get to -Place isn't super clean",

So go back to GF, then decide I'll get a burrito instead. Go back up to the same spot and order a burrito. They tell me they are out of burritos... there's tortillas there and all the ingredients. I said \"you're out?\" And was told \"yes no burritos.\" So i said \"is it just one of the meats? I can do a different kind\" \"no. no burritos\"  So i left without any food and honestly bummed with one of my favorite spots. Never had an experience like that before here. Gonna hit some other spots for a while",

With the chicken the flavor seemed to get lost. Guacamole is terrific and paired nicely.  There is a salsa bar where there are a variety of sauces to choose from.

However, this place becomes too crowded and loud when there are a lot of customers, live music and etc. (Worth mentioning the live music is more like a karaoke).  Staff that serve are mostly friendly whereas the cashiers are too agitated and they always seems like being behind and rushed.  Going back to the taste which is the more important part: the Adobada (spicy pork) is not so tasty. Sometimes too dry. They also add pineapple in addition to other toppings which made me don't eat it since I don't like sweet things in my taco (so be aware)",

I usually get everything on my tacos.   The bowl is also really good. Tastes better than Chipotle, except they only offer asada and chicken for the meat (sorry al pastor!)  The restaurant itself is nice. They have an upstairs for additional seating and also seats outside. It can definitely get busy though. You can order your tacos to go and they will wrap the plate with tinfoil.",

(Who wants pineapple in their taco anyway!)  but he did agree that the carne asada mula was  really tasty! The chorizo one was not too good :(",

I had to ask if they can give me new meat and they looked at me like I was crazy.  My only advice is watch them when they make your tacos oh and the employees must have not realized I understood Spanish.  smh. I heard a few choice words aimed at my request for new meat but I won't sweat the small stuff!",

There's bottled drinks, alcohol, and tap drinks. I got a tap drink, because I wanted unlimited refills. Everything is self serve. Get your own food. Make your own sauces.  Refill your own drinks.  No WiFi I could. It's located near a lot of businesses and you don't have to venture too far from the highway to get there. Good location.  Decor felt original and vibrant.

That is a bit much if you want different things.   The cashier was popping her pimples and then taking money and handing over cups.

But not like tacos on the street authentic.  CLEAN, authentic, modern... Need I say more ?!   Their set up reminds me of Tacos El Gordo.  You go straight up to the area of where you'd like something from and order right there!  The best part is that since I'm Vegetarian and most of the group isn't, there was STILL plenty of variety for both: meat-eaters & non-meat-eaters alike! (This of course was my favorite part)  Also, you've got so many toppings and salsas to choose from as well. This made building the Tacos extra fun   Aside from the food, the place is really nice inside and out. The ordering area where the food is at, the bar area, upstairs, the patio and the bathrooms. Everything was kept up with and running smoothly.   I'd absolutely come back again, especially for a bigger group!  Thanks Taco y Taco for a great night!  Your restaurant is appreciated",

    "text": "3 cheers for happy hour pricing on beers!   Like many others have said, this restaurant is set up like a fancy Tacos el Gordo. Except the patrons and ambiance are a lot more wannabe hipster and lot less Mexican.   The food is good. Flavorful, if a little bit on the saucy / soggy side. The Mexican street corn is really delicious and they really don't skimp on the meat and cheese on the carne asada fries.   My main dislike is how freaking loud it is in here. During happy hour they have a live DJ, which is fine because it's like, \"whoo party tiiime,\" but even during regular hours they BLAST the club music. It is unnecessary for the music to be so loud, and it distracts from the food and conversation.   My second dislike is sort of related to the set up. I understand they're trying to do it like tacos el gordo with separate meat stations, and that works only if they move FAST and at similar speeds. However, the burrito / fish & shrimp taco / fries, nachos & corn station is significantly slower than the meat stations. That means that if you want carne asada fries AND an al pastor taco, even if you order the fries first, go order the al pastor taco, and come back for the fries, by the time the fries come out your taco is cold. Even if you order carne asada fries and a shrimp taco (same station), they come out so far apart from each other that one is inevitably cold and soggy by the time the other comes out. So the only way to have all hot items is to order only meat items and no sides.  Update: They are obsessed with the vampiro right now. My friend ordered an al pastor taco, out came a vampiro. I ordered 1 pibil taco and 1 chicharron taco, out came 1 taco and 1 vampiro....",

I think people may have quantity confused with quality, because variety is just about the only thing this place has to offer. The line system was non-existent and employees walked around sweeping, yet didn't offer help to new customers that were clearly clueless. The music (techno & house) was blaring and not at all in tune with the supposed authentic Mexican experience the numerous signs claim you are said to encounter. And then there's the food, which was really just...blah. All in all it was a huge dissapointment unworthy of a follow up visit, which is a bummer because I'd been looking forward to eating here for quite some time.",

I felt like they didn't have enough cheese, and the cheese that was on there was hardly melted.   BUT, the tacos are great!  I love the carnitas, but my favorite were the vampiro!  I had never had one before, but it was outstanding!  The cheese was caramelized and crispy.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This is across town for me, so we won't go often, but when a taco craving strikes, for sure!",

As others have mentioned the ordering system is certainly unique but once you \"get it\" it's rather straightforward. The counter staff's friendly explanation helped as well. Our order consisted of two burritos (carne asada for me and pollo for my wife, both with the guacamole add-on), chips, and a fountain pop. The burritos were fantastic and well-built; delicious and tender meat, tasty guac, and just the right proportions of ingredients. The chips were also very enjoyable as they were light and crisp without any residual oil. We tried the mild red, tomatillo, hot habanero, and avocado salsas from the self-serve salsa bar, and all of them were tasty with the mild red and avocado being our favorites. Altogether it was a fantastic, fulfilling meal in a friendly and cool atmosphere for less than $26.",

    "text": "I've heard things about Taco y Taco, but I'm never quite near a location. We decided to grab a quick lunch here to seize the opportunity.   We settled on getting tacos -   Al Pastor -  it was on the sweeter side of marinades and a bit leaner meat. That can be a pro/con depending what you are into, but I happened to enjoy it.   Cabeza - this was really good, they chopped it up well so that you get a even distribution of the meat and fatty bits.   Lengua - If you aren't sure about lengua bits, this version may be easier to swallow as it was shredded up.   The one thing I wasn't expected was it was gonna be dressed with salsa already. I mean, I suppose that's not a bad thing except I saw there were other sauces at the condiment bar that I wanted to try. Just FYI in case you are one who is spice sensitive (al pastor salsa had kick) or want to try various sauce that \"everything\" on it meant that.   Prices weren't bad at $2.25, but are definitely higher than street tacos as they gotta pay rent on this large space.   I enjoyed their horchata. It wasn't the usual Bang brand mix, but seems homemade! Lovely creaminess and just the right amount of spices...Yum!   I did enjoy the tacos so I would be back, but only if it's not busy. I absolutely hate this style of ordering at stations when it's busy as it just gets to be a confusing and everyone getting in each others way.",

It's confusing and has multiple lines, which would be a cool concept if other people had the same understanding. We waited in line for probably 10 minutes because everyone was just as confused as I was. Finally, we squeeze our way through to the front of the burrito line, and we were met with the absolute worst customer service my small brain could imagine. Being a restaurant connoisseur, I knew I wanted Al Pastor which was the meat for my burrito. She asked what I want, and I had to repeat myself 4 times before she interrupted saying that there was no Al Pastor. I saw it? But that didn't discourage me. Being a Good Samaritan, I kept going without a complaint. When I sat down to eat, the food was dry and bland, and tasted low quality. Me and my squad will never return to here. We are utterly hungry and pitifully disappointed. Chipotle Is two miles down the street.",

    "text": "So I decided to try something new over my favorite place to go get a salad (cafe rio)  I had heard wonderful things about this place so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.  It was a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30 pm when we walked in. We had never been before and a lady immediately addressed us and asked if she could be of assistance. She explained how everything worked and then we got into our designated lines to order.  We waited for 5 minutes before I asked her if anyone would be taking my order. She looked at me and told me the gentleman (who was on a phone call) would be able to help me when he was done. I was a bit confused because her and 2 other people were standing around. He then got of the phone call 5 minutes later and apologized about the wait.  I wasn't sure if I wanted a chicken or carne bowl so he allowed me to try the meat. I decided to go with the Carne bowl. Lettuce, white cilantro rice, bell peppers and onion, pico de gallo and pinto beans.  My boyfriend got a Carne burrito. They were going to charge us $1.25 for a small container of guacamole but I think the gentleman just let it slide due to us having to wait.  We then went up to the second floor to eat. This was nice, however I would recommend placing a drink machine with utensils and maybe a small salsa bar up there as well. (we had to walk down to get refills and needed utensils)  We then bit into out food... That has to be the worst carne I have ever eaten in my entire life! It was so extremely salty that it made the whole meal unenjoyable. My boyfriend said the same for his burrito.  I literally got a headache from how salty the food was about 2 hours later after leaving.  the 2 meals plus a drink were around $19.00 but honestly not worth it. I don't think I will be trying this place out again.",

Guac was Amazeballs, the chicken, steak and al pastor tacos were to me better than el Gordo. The set up was similar with different lines for the meats but there was more variety. Carne Asada fries are my new fave!!! Will be back often!",

They also have Mexican street corn and they did not disappoint; it's basically sweet corn, mayo and parm with paprika. Love LOVE this place! Also the people are SUPER SWEET! They noticed it was our first time and helped with ordering. Thanks Taco y Taco staff for a wonderful breakfast!",

Same great food, but add a bar and a snazzy interior, this location is a whole new experience.   The restaurant is the same set up as the original location. Ordering stations based on the type of meat you will be ordering. They have the same great salsa bar and menu items, so I'm excited. The al pastor is still my favorite but I have to branch out next time. Elote is also a must.   If only they would open a location on my side of town, but until then I will be making the drive to their Trop and Eastern locations in the time being.",

I doubt the average gringo will order cabeza, sesos or tripa but it's still cool that you can find these delicacies in this part of town. To stay on the safer side, I suggest the Al Pastor which I think is their best offering along with an elote (street corn). Try a mushroom quesadilla: simple yet delicious. Overall a great place for a good Mexican fix without having to set foot in an abomination like Chipotle or Cafe Rio.",

    "text": "I think this one ends up getting between a 3 and a 4 star (if only I could do half-stars here) from me, and here's why...  Pros: the food is delicious!  And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.  Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).  All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.  Go to Taco Y Taco, instead.",

    "text": "I'm going to preface this review by saying I thought I didn't like tacos or Mexican food in general. Now I know I just didn't like bad/subpar tacos. Which shouldn't surprise anyone since I tend to be drawn to the finer things in life but that's a discussion for another day. The crazy thing is this place is cheap, I would easily pay more for what we order.   My favorites are the carne asado vampiro which can be described as a crispy grilled taco. The barbacoa taco with all it's accompaniments and the mexican corn. It's bad for my waistline so I usually convince someone to share it with me.  The burrito- hands down the best I have ever had.   I love the location, music and overall vibe of the place.",

    "text": "Eating at Taco Y Taco is a gargantuan battle between quality vs. quantity.  If you prefer quality and you're willing to pay $2.25 for a dinky taco that tastes great but you can finish in two bites (maybe even one), this is your place.  If, however, you reasonably expect to have a full belly after spending $15 on food regardless if it's quality, then skip this place.  Have been there three times.  There probably won't be a fourth time.  The first two times I ordered four carne asada tacos and two chicken tacos, cost over $14.  They tasted great, but were so small I was still very hungry after I was done eating them.  It was like eating an appetizer and then wondering where the main course was.  Went there today for a third time, hoping for more.  Instead I got less.  Ordered the same items as before:  four carne asada tacos and two chicken tacos for $14+.  The carne asada tacos were so small I actually witnessed a co-worker pull the guy making my tacos aside to correct him about how little meat he was putting in the tacos.  Even after he corrected it, I still didn't get much meat.  Then when I went to the counter to pay and they said \"How is everything?\" I said I was disappointed in the amount of meat in my two chicken tacos and showed one to them, and they confirmed that was the proper amount of meat.  Which shocked me as the amount of meat wasn't enough to feed a small bird, let alone a human male.  Sure enough, I got home, ate all six of the tiny excuses for tacos I paid $14+ for, and am still hungry.  Third time I've been three, third time I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  Even if the food tastes very good.  Doubtful I'll be back.",

    "text": "Having eaten at the other Taco Y taco several times I was pleasantly surprised at the decor and size of this location. It has ample searing including an upstairs area that's a chill dimly light area to hang with friends and grab some drinks.   Ordering can be kind of Tricky since there's different lines for different menu items. We came on a Tuesday and had no idea about happy hour. They offer $5 chicken nachos and tacos 3 for $2 carnitas tacos no substitutions. They also have specials on drinks and have a bar area to order drinks and a limited seating area. I love the gran tacos so I ordered one of those nachos to share and tacos for my friend. The nachos are fully loaded and they don't skimp on anything. I've sampled most of the menu items from the other location. Al pastor if you're a fan is very good it's joy a favorite of mine but it is good. Also the tripas are good and the carne Asada fries have to be my favorite in town hands down. What makes them the best is that the fries are super crispy the guacamole is freshly made (not premade) and they actually grill their carne over an open flame giving the meat more flavor. Just make sure you have some horchata with your meals it's so delicious!",

As we waited and ordered from the Al Pastor line there was a quick serve, when it was my turn to order a carnitas and lengua taco I was  told to go to the next server.  4 people cut ahead and were being served.  At this time my boyfriend asked if we could be served and the server became rude and told us to calm down.  I could not believe how we were being addressed.  Being Mexican myself I was just embarrassed of his tone and the impression he was leaving with the rest of the guests in line.  We were told they were short handed but this does not excuse the taquero to treat us in such a rude way.   Hopefully after reading this Taco y Taco will address this concern and treat all their customers kindly and without excuses. The food is delicious as always but the service is what draws customers back as well!",

Then proceeded to the line to pay.. Waited another 15 minutes.. Because only one register was being manned while employees were standing right there goofing around.   Got to paying.. AFTER almost 30 minutes ! My tacos got cold.. So I asked for fresh ones.. And the manager or supervisor or whoever he was proceeded to tell me, that I shouldn't have done that and that next time I should have multiple people stand in lines, so food doesn't get cold.. LOL what a joke. All the employees gave me a look and I felt uncomfortable. CARLOS, the man cooking the Al Pastor meat, was very rude saying \"This is the only time we're doing this.. And don't expect it again.\"  They need to be more organized because the ordering process is ridiculous..  WILL NEVER BE EATING HERE AGAIN AND WILL BE CONTACTING MANAGEMENT.",

There's plenty of seating with the downstairs and upstairs area combined. I love the decor and how bright and open it is. I wasn't quite sure about the DJ booth, but I guess it's hip and cool huh. I also liked the bar they offered although I don't usually partake in alcohol consumption that early in the day.  My one complaint is that they stuck the salsa bar right in front of the taco lines. Of course we were there when it was busy so everyone was trying to form around it. It was a mess and nobody knew where each line was going. My second complaint would have to be the tea. After selecting the unsweetened ice tea and running upstairs to eat we discovered that it was raspberry instead. Someone made an oopsie.   After we stood in multiple lines to get an array of tasty tacos we headed upstairs to chow down. And boy was it delicious! The Al pastor was flavorful and we also tried vampiro which we had to ask a friend exactly what that was. But in the end I think the vampiro won me over and is now my favorite. We also had elote which my son devoured before I could get two bites. Ha ha.  All in all I enjoyed it and I would definitely choose this one over the other location.",

If your idea or Mexican food is Cafe Rio, Nacho Daddy, Del Taco, Taco Bell, or having a burrito or chips and salsa, it is best for you to stay at those restaurants, because this is NOT going to match your idea of Mexican Food.  b.  The meat here is absolutely fantastic:  -Buche - Pork Stomach -Carnitas - Braised Pork -Suedero - Beef from the upper leg / lower belly -Cesos - The thinking part of the cow -Lengua - Tongue -Cabeza - Meet from the head of the cow, so it has many things, as you can imagine. -Pibil - Slow Roasted Pork -Al Pastor - Love it, they shave the meat directly from the spit. -Taco Asada - Grilled Beef -Chorizo - Pork Sausage -Mulas - I guess you can say this is a \"slider\" but more like a taco mini quesadilla.  c.  Prices are all about 2.25 per taco.  they also had other items here, breakfast burritos, and some other items other than tacos.  d. Salsa Bar has great hot and mild sauces as well as fresh salsa.  This was very tasty.  e.  The ambiance is the same exact set up from when this place was a pub called The Republic.  This means all the decor and details are not too authentic.  f.  Music - They have a great set up to play loud music.  I felt it was too loud.  g.  Be careful - going during normal hours, the long lines her overwhelming.  GK says, try this place out.",

This could be just me, but upon entering the place, I felt the heighten chaos and super loud music as an assault to my senses. We stood there confused for some time wondering how to order and where to go. We noticed a bunch of people with something like a line so we went and stood there... thankfully someone came to us and asked us if we knew about the ordering process. She explained how it works - you go in the line that you want something from (line 1, 2, or 3). But the problem is, for someone who does not know a lot of spanish terms, half of the items would not make sense unless they google it or ask what it means. I did not feel very comfortable asking about each and every item in such a chaotic rushed environment. I would have appreciated some kind of a hand-held menu with descriptions. There were a lot of people there who seemed to know what to do so again maybe I am the only one feeling the need for an explanation.  Food was ok, I think I have had much more delicious tacos and tostadas in Las Vegas with much better ambience and presentation. Price was good but I don't think I will go back.",

It was great. We also picked up some corn in one of the many lines to choose from when you go up to order and we decided to get it mexican street style, now not to downplay the alpastor tacos but the Mexican street style corn was the highlight, perfectly cooked sweet corn with all the fixins is enough to make you come back for more. The salsa bar also had some great options and I would definitely recommend the habanero salsa.  Now, lets get to the few things I was not see excited about.  1.) Pick a line any line- If you want an alpastor taco and a carnita taco it is in two separate lines and then if you need to pick up some corn you have to get in another line.  2.) Pay for your meal- Yes it is another line, It really reminded me of a college cafeteria, walk the line get what you want and then the dude in the hairnet at the end will ring you up.  3.) Cleanliness- most of the tables in the dining area had not been wiped down or cleaned and it just made the entire place seem dirty.   Overall, Yeah i will probably end up here a time or few again but I don't know know that I will be making it my go to taco spot.",

They did convert most of the bar area into walk-up, taco order stations.  There are a couple different stations which are not clearly identified so you'll just need to walk up, hail someone working and ask for what you want and they'll tell you where you need to order.  To me.... this isn't really all that convenient because you could be standing in the wrong area only to find out you need to order what you want 2 feet to your left which may or may not have a line.  And the line situation is just whoever speaks up first because the \"line\" isn't all that defined.  And then there's the cashier.  I don't know if she was new or just confused.  She rang us up, my husband ordered a beer which requires a totally separate transaction and then when I ordered my soft drink she said she had already processed our order and had to ring up my drink separately from everything else.  Why would you finish ringing up an order before asking if we wanted another beverage or anything else?  Not the best experience.  The taste of the food was really good and had great flavor.  But the service and the way the whole place is set up just turns me off so I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "Taco Y Taco offers one of the best of the taco off the strip.  They have a full range of different meats and tortilla combinations from gourmet gut busters to the simple but scrumptious three-bite street tacos. Plus, lots of different salsas to choose from.  My favorite taco's are: Mulas - Two soft tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle. Vampiro - Two crisp tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle.  Dining experience is cool and unexpected considering this is taco shop.  They have a decent lounge area setup, you can order drinks and relax.    It's worth checking out!!",

    "text": "This was a trendy looking place with a full bar.  You order, get your food an then pay.  The vampiro was my favorite it was a crisp tortilla with the meat inside almost like the tostada without cheese.   The al pastor was so yummy yum yum, the carnitas you can still see it in the oil when they take it our.  They have all kinds if meat and seafood too.  The salsa bar is impressive if you like all the condiments.  It was super clean and easy to get to.  The ordering process is kind of confusing they have lines to order but not sure why.   The green salsa they have behind the counter is super hot compared to the tomatillo sauce at the salsa bar.   I ordered the carnitas and al pastor.  They aren't skimpy with meat.  I liked this place and have it a five even though I usually would give it a 4 because it is pricy for 4.00 but the one can be made into two if you want.",

    "text": "Already a fan of the location on East Tropicana, I was excited when Tia Shirley B. informed me that a new Taco y Taco would be opening in this part of Henderson, close to where I work, work out often, and have many friends who live in the area (including Shirley B.).  A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride, ready to get our taco on.      Just after opening at 11:00am, we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting, high ceilings, a bar, and staff that greeted us heartily; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant, so it may be the nicest taco place I've visited. I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day, but not a bad thing. There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit.       Set up like the other location, there are stations where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.      Meat choices: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).   There's a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order.     I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple, a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside), and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo, cheese, and chili powder)--I was hungry one minute and then full the next.  My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished.       This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location, the tasty food, and the service; I'll definitely be here a lot.  BTW, for those fellow Yeeps who've been missing Tia Shirley B. while she's been off Yelp, she's been here almost every day since they opened so you may see her when you visit!  Buen provecho, mis amigos--la vida es demasiada corta para ser descontento o comer comida mala.",

    "text": "Good bye Taco Bell and Roberto's. Taco Y Taco will be the only place I will ever get tacos or burritos at. I guess I'm a little late hopping onto the train but I'll give you some pointers before you go. You might feel like $2.50/taco is a little pricey but they do have the typical side items you find at Roberto's such as the salsas, cucumbers and what not and this location is just too fancy to have it be a fast food place.   #1: Do your research. Look on yelp for pictures of the menu and learn what the Spanish words mean. With so many cow parts, pig parts to choose from, you really won't know which to get (or order one of each). However, of the ones I tried, the Al Pastor (pork) and the Tripas tacos were the best.   #2: DO GET THE CORN. Sweet, juicy, covered in butter and parmesan cheese. Yum-O.   #3: Get all 8 sauces/salsas. Don't question what the bright green, pale green, red, orange ones are. Just get them and dip everything in them. You'll eventually find your favorite.",

The prices were $2 at the Tropicana location 2 years ago but increased to $2.15 last year and meow $2.25 this year however the inflation in prices is more than reasonable. You will not find a nicer taco restaurant in America. The bathrooms have automatic towels and marble sinks with nice flooring. The venue has high ceilings and very spacious plus a full bar with numerous beers on tap, liquor and unique beer bottles. The other location is also clean and spacious.

    "text": "We went for dinner and I have to say the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was for a couple of little things during the dining process yet overall it was fantastic. What I will say that I loved most was that no matter if your a carnivore like my husband or vegan/ vegetarian such as my self they had tacos, burritos, and anything many options for you. Unlike some places these vegetarian or vegan options only consist or tofu, well thank your lucky stars people....we have finally found a place that serves us real tacos without tofu as the only option!!! There are 4 options actually, one that's a mushroom and grilled onion blend that I tried and loved...it doesn't come topped with cilantro and onions so I added it but, you can add the topping you prefer. Also a grilled veggie, which I also had which is topped with cilantro, onion, Pico, and guacamole, it's absolutely fantastic as well. They had two other options as well but, I don't remember off hand, that I didn't try and will save untill next time. The only reason I dropped a star in this area was because, though my tacos were fantastic and the person making was knowledgeable and helpful. I had no idea what was going on when I first arrived. I literally was waiting in the same line with my husband looking at the three menus trying to compare to see if I just ask them to make mine with those options. I was clueless as to what I was to do at first. The guy behind the meat counter not helping my husband offered me no help what so ever. It wasn't until my husband told me where to order that I finally placed my meal. We also decided on buying chips, though they have some in a pan with a heat lamp and we came on a night when not to busy, we received the ones prepared in the togo box cold and stale. Other than those two things, I highly recommend coming and trying this little street taco place in Henderson, especially if your vegetarian or vegan. Oh by the way my husband says the meat tacos were delicious as well! Recommend the pork over the carne asada though....yet, both were fabulous! On another note so was the salsa bar! Thanks Taco Y Taco!!!",

    "text": "We love this place. We live in Summerlin but we make the drive about once a week to eat here. The food is awesome. We ate there this afternoon about 3 pm because they advertised $1 carnitas & al pastor tacos. When we were done eating I looked at the receipt and saw a $100 service charge added to our $28 bill. I took it to the cashier who got a manager. They looked for my signed receipt but couldn't find it. That seems fishy to me; it had only been about 15 minutes since we paid and the receipts were all in a rubber band in the cash register. Somehow mine, with the extra $100 tip, is missing?  The manager didn't seem clear on how to fix it but said he did so I'll wait and see what comes through my account tomorrow. He technically said \"sorry\" but it didn't seem like a real apology to me. I realized on the way home that they also overcharged us for the carnitas tacos. 3/$5.50 is not $1/each. It's only $2.50 but they should know what their specials are and charge appropriately.  We'll most likely eat here again because we love the tacos, but I'll only pay cash from now on.",

Only my 2nd time here, my husband is a regular he ABSOLUTLY LUVS the El Pastor tacos, he raves about them.....,      My fist visit I did indulge in taco y taco carnitas tacos & yes quite, quite good on the handmade corn tortillas and all fresh ingredients~this time I decided on a different route........almost went the Gran Taco however opted fo a burrito and MAN O MAN WAS IT DELISHHHHHJ~ again with the carnitas ( oh so good, juicy, flavorful, not to spicy for this Gringa! )  also LUV that they offer 2 different bean selections & 2 different guacamole options!!!!! She steamed my flour tortilla, added my options then rolled it and placed it in a grill so it was slightly crispy & warm~ just heavenly to me.      Another nice feature is the full bar , I ordered a margarita, accepted an upgraded tequila recommendation from the bartender and it was possibly the BEST margarita I have EVER had!!! REALLY & only $7 bucks a total DEAL, in my opinion       I also like the decor of Taco y Taco. Clearly it is a restaurant, however it does have a clubby vibe, as I believe it was some sort of nightclub in a previous life.    If your on Eastern near 215 check Taco y Taco it will make you feel Muy Bueno",

Flavor is excellent, menu has variety, staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is very much appreciated. The fact that they have a legitimate bar just makes the place go from good to awesome. I'm used to going to Robertos, Pepes, Tacos El Gordo etc. These places have been put on notice. Hopefully taco y taco can come to Southwest Las Vegas, because I love this place! Highly recommend you go... The elote and shrimp tacos were my favorite thing, but then again I haven't tried everything.",

YUM!  It's a cool hipster, cafeteria-style restaurant so head over to the right side and grab a tray. Then order whatever you desire at each specific stations (al pastor station, tacos station etc.). Proceed down the line and you'll come to a salad counter where you can order other fixings like mexican street style corn! When you get to the cashier, that's the end of the line.  Don't miss the fine stuff in the salsa salad bar. Their hot sauces are the bomb!",

    "text": "I went last night for dinner with friends -- however the mariachi band was playing, and was super loud (so if you're wanting to talk and have conversation with your fellow dinees, don't go on Mondays between 6-7pm).  Thankfully they only played for the first 20 minutes of our outing and we were all able to catch up!  My first impression was a fancier Tacos El Gordo (still my number 1) with smaller portions.  The food overall was a tad salty for my liking, but then again I like sodium in low doses.   I ordered two chicken tortas with everything (this included onions, pico de gallo, and guacamole - which was amazing).  They were small but delicious and reasonably priced.  With this I ordered a side of chips and guacamole (because you can never have too much guac) and the serving was a large quantity and every one at the table was able to enjoy -- although, like mentioned before, a tad too salty for me.   Overall, I enjoyed the venue (modern, artsty) and the ambiance was nice.  I'll probably be back but this won't become a regular spot.   PS. I wish they didn't use paper and Styrofoam cases and plates....so bad for the environment and I don't think they recycle. ):",

    "text": "I'm so conflicted how to write this review so I'll start with this-- I love Taco Y Taco!  The food is amazing, the prices are reasonable and I go there all the time!  I just want management/corporate to see this review because I'll NEVER GO AGAIN ON CINCO DE MAYO.  The way you order food here is **already confusing enough** with a separate line for each type of food.  And god-forbid you want more than one type of taco/meat you have to stand in each separate line and once you wait in every line, there's ANOTHER line to the cashier.  Add 300+ people crammed in the room, nobody had any idea what they were waiting in line for.  People were cutting and being rude.  There was about 25 mins from when we got our tacos and street corn to when we made it to pay.  By the time we sat down everything was COLD and not as good.  This is simply an infrastructure failure on the manager's part to not anticipate and control the flow of the crowd.  They could have made cones or ropes and directed the line in a way that could have gotten everybody fed and happy.  Instead it was CHAOS.  Honestly we would have walked out the door had it not been for the nice girl at the entrance handing out free Coronas, which calmed me down enough to wait.  Epic fail by management.  Great tacos!!  For some reason Yelp won't let me attach a picture but I have one of my girlfriend practically being TRAMPLED  and holding up her phone with a cartoon picture of \"HELL\".",

The first of which was when I showed up the other day at 11 to grab lunch. There were already several people there before me. I say this because was no pastor ready (it was still cooking), there was one person working all the lines while the rest of the staff was talking and fooling around in the back. Needless to say I waited for 30 min to get my food. The second and third  instances happened on the same day. I ordered 2 burritos and after getting them realize that there was no hair sauce etc. I went to my table to put  things down and to ask if there was any hot sauce. In then the time it took do do that the items were gone.  What upsets me the most is that the owner/managing partner didn't seem to care about either situation and carried on with her conversation while the dining room literally became over ran with spills, over filled trash cans and dirty tables. Ultimately, items can be replaced, but it's hard to change perceptions once you've had repeated bad experiences from a place you admired and love going too.",

They had many options for meat as well as many vegetarian options which is good because I'm married to a vegetarian. The meat was flavorful and the prices were very reasonable. It came off very Chipotle like at first but this ain't no Chipotle. It's much much more! There is also a bar inside as well as a salsa table set up. They were very friendly and efficient. We did not know what to do or how to order at first and the guy at one of the stations walked us though it. We will return!",

Sauteed mushroom tacos were great. Both corn and flour taco shells are very fresh and soft. Street corn looked tempting while they were being prepared, I will try them next time. Plenty of salsa and sauce options. Ordering process left me confused for a while.",

Everything is customizable as you go along the food bar when they prepare your food and they have many additional options of salsa and add-ons at their salsa bar. Had delicious lengua tacos, but my carne asada taco was way too salty that I barely even touched it. Chicken nachos were also very good and only $5 for for decently large sized portion during their happy hour. The other drink and food items on their happy hour also looked very enticing.   Pretty nice atmosphere, especially when compared to LA for street-style Mexican food.",

    "text": "This location is bigger and better than the one on Tropicana and WAY better than Tacos El Gordo.  Food: I typically just get the al pastor. They put little pieces of pineapple on every order of al pastor and it's a nice touch. Other places do it too, but I really enjoy the flavor here of the al pastor with the pineapple and their avocado salsa. The tacos are delicious, but I also enjoy getting the vampiro or mulas (I'd recommend the vampiro if you want something crunchy). As for the other meats, I've tried some of them (lengua, carne asada, cabeza) and they're good too but I really prefer the al pastor.   Location: This place is really spacious and pretty clean. They even have an upstairs! Don't think I've actually ever gone upstairs though because there are usually seats available downstairs. And besides, I don't want to walk up the stairs.. I want to devour that al pastor ASAP!   Service: It can be a little annoying having to go to the different windows to get different meats and sides, but once you know what you're doing, it's not too bad. The staff is friendly and help direct you to the correct window if you need help. I really enjoy the condiments and salsa bar too. Always getting a nice helping of the grilled onions and peppers and extra salsa =)",

Also all the lines run into the other so you never know who is in what line. It's also SUPER loud so you can't hear what the cooks are saying to you. There's been a couple of times when I've missed heard the cook and they roll their eyes at me EVERY SINGLE TIME!  I believe in bad days and don't take it personally so I came back 2 more times and it has been the same way everytime. The food has no taste. The first time I just thought it was because it was fresh and not processed, well no their food just absolutely has NO taste. I say save your money and go to a taco truck. Even a run down taco truck would be better than this place.",

The tacos did taste good so that's why they get a four star.  I like the salsa bar and taco toppings.  I think next time I will have to eat there.  When I paid I thought it was pricey.  I did not not notice until I left I was charged for six tacos.  I called and returned for a refund for the extra charge.   I do not eat pork so I thought it was so disgusting seeing the cooked pig intestines at the next station.   I will definitely try them again and hopefully it will be a better experience.",

He was loving the decor and loud music...not the type of music though, he wanted club stuff but I was pleased to listen to Peter Bjorn and John playing :-) I really like the look of the place very yuppie gringo. The tables are clean and so was the salsa bar. There was even a upstairs area which I didn't even realize until I left the restaurant and saw the stairs in the window.   I had to try the Alpastor since that's my favorite and serves as a good bench mark. I had two with all the fixings, pineapple and all. I liked the pineapple on it but the sauce was so spicy I couldn't get the flavor of the Alpastor. I'll probably come back and try it again without the sauce but most likely go to the E. Tropicana location to see how they do it, word on the streets is their food is slightly better. Maybe it's all the gringo ambiance at this location, lack of authentic feel created a perception that effected my taste buds this wasn't the biz. Most likely it was the way too hot of sauce though :-/   Taco El Gordo still reign supreme ;-) but I'll come here for the cool music.",

I'm gonna say it's bc you order 'ritos from a good 30 ft from the spit, so they cut of slices and keep it in a container, which dries out the meat, but really, I have no clue what the problem was. Beyond that, the salsa counter is still amazing (8 different salsas and a number of sides) and the digs, whoa, MAJOR upgrade to from the other location. High ceilings, interesting furniture... well done! Other props go to the fact that a side of guac is monstrous. That NEVER happens.   Bottom line, is it as good at the one on Trop? No. Is it still a solid place to go for a good burrito? Yessir.    Protip: full bar in this mamma jamma",

Don't ever throw an event here, they will not keep up with you, inconsistencies from the beginning , broken promises, catering \"managers\" will not keep in charge of nothing; making you worry about simple things that a person throwing a party at a VENUE should not be worrying about. One of the cashiers that are supposedly supposed to be helping get annoyed with little requests that you wouldn't think you would have to ask for from them, but give you attitude because they say they \"don't have them.\" Which doesn't make sense because they end up bringing them 2 minutes later with a huge attitude. Don't recommend to anyone. Catering here will be a horrible experience! They will push your party back without a care in the world & without even letting the person know!!!!

    "text": "The convenient part of Taco Y Taco is that they're open late night especially around the location that it is in where there are barely eating spots available. So it's nice to not travel as far as the strip or China town to get food. There are 4 stations for different items but during late nights there's only one person running the three Taco stations. The 4th station, next to the register is where you'd let the person know you'd want things like a burrito or carne asada fries for example. Then you'd pay at the register and sit and wait for your food to come out once it's ready. I got four tacos, a breakfast burrito, and carne asada fries for $25.09 w/ tax. We waited about ten minutes for our carne asada fries and breakfast burrito. While we waited we packed some sauces from their condiment bar where you could pack limes, mild sauce, habanero sauce, etc. Customer service was great, I really liked how patient the cashier was with us with it being our first time but the only issue was the guy at the 4th station was cleaning AND serving food with the same gloves on. You could see him taking a cleaning rag and wiping down spilt food, taking dirty dishes back and forth to the dishwashing station, and then coming back to his station rolling up a burrito with the same gloves, no changing it or washing it. So I'm not sure if I ever want to come back just because of that, they were slow anyways so he had the opportunity to wash his hands and change his gloves after cleaning. Aside from that the food was awesome! It's a bittersweet feeling for me, I love the taste of their food but thinking of how it's prepared with the same cleaning gloves worries me. Two stars for the cashier's customer service and their food.",

The selections of taco meats are vast just like those of other taco places, however they do have a bar area here with beer and liquor to satisfy your tequila or beer drinking selves, and they have extras that most other places don't serve; Spanish rice, corn street style, Etc.

Again the food wasn't too bad, although the quesadilla was not my cup of tea. It could've been the fact that the lady dropped one of my quesadillas and made the second in a rush. I couldn't tell if it tasted weird because there was too much cheese, undercooked or maybe it was overcooked ...?   My annoyance with the lines is probably enough to make me think twice before going again.",

    "text": "This is my new Burrito Palace! I happened by one day last week with my daughter and we were both in for a BIG surprise.   Taco y Taco was a little overwhelming when we walked in the door because it was kind of confusing. You don't sit down at a table and wait for someone to take your order. They have several walk-up stations where you place your order. (I can live with that since the food was EXTREMELY tasty and made to order).   The process was easy, pick your meat ... beef, chicken, pork and then decide if you want a taco, burrito, etc. I love the hand-made tortillas! The food was fresh and hot. My daughter had the Al Pastor tacos (pork) with everything (pineapple, onion and cilantro and a super burrito - just the way I like it :) We also tried the Elotes (Mexican street corn) - yummy!  They offer smashed avocado AND guacamole!That's a nice touch for people who love avocado but don't want the extra seasonings that come in guacamole.  I have to agree with Robin G and Richard C about the cashier. The young lady who rang up our order was upset with another staffer and didn't hesitate to argue a bit with him right in front of us. The cooks at the station were really nice. I'm happy to find a tasty restaurant that stays open past 10 pm. I'll be back! I talked about Taco y Taco on my morning show <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FSizzle.Vegas&s=38459c170c8090dcba9f17369c2b7690c7e2e5027186d594f52cff6777da9e75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sizzle.Vegas</a> - You'll find the review at 5:30 on the timeline: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-Rfs9mLR-Yg&s=460c62d042402c97dab82d049a1ba5b2b8a89268b4e8a9275905f27d311cbb5d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=-Rfs...</a>",

I'd probably come here over Gordos! It's pretty spacious too! There's even an upstairs you can go to dine.   Last visit I got -- Corizo taco, carne tostada, and El Pastor taco. My favorite was the Corizo. It had just the right amount of heat to it where I didn't even have to put extra salsa. But of course I did anyways because I  just love the heat! Lol the Carne tostada was my least favorite. The crunch the tostada had had a burnt taste to it that I didn't like. It was kind of hard to eat. BUT, the carne was cooked to perfection. The el pastor was pretty amazing too although next time I'm gonna have to ask for no pineapple! YUCK! I hate anything sweet when I'm eating something savory! My taste palette doesn't know what to do!   HH isn't really that great. $2 tacos and $1 off their beer and house wines. Barely missed HH but oh well.",

The folks at Taco y Taco have transformed this spot into the hippest looking taqueria  you'll ever step foot in. I think what attracts people here are cleanliness. location, and convenience. Taste is first and foremost to me, and when it comes down to flavor, it's just okay for me. Having Al Pastor'd and Tripa'd well over 100 times, these are my go-to fillings when it's taco time,as well as cabeza and lengua. I will say that the guys putting together your order are very helpful and will ham it up when you snap a picture!  Other good things I've seen here...the asada is done over an open flame, their tasty horchata is made from scratch and not the nasty packaged mix(free refills too!) and I like the offerings at the salsa bar. Not much of a fan of the cafeteria style ordering though, because from the time you hit up the al pastor guy, then the vampiro guy, get your burrito and street corn from the next station, then pay, then get your sides, salsas and drinks, your food will be stone cold like Steve Austin, whereas at a vendor, you order from one person, the cooks get your order out quickly, and you can enjoy your order hot, and all on one plate. To each his own...I guess...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3",

There is one line for the al pastor tacos, another line for all other types of tacos and another station for nachos or bowls.  The al pastor looked really good as he was carving it off for my taco.  Honestly, it didn't have as much flavor as I hoped it would.  Don't get me wrong.  It was good... just not memorable.  The nachos were ok.  Again I had the al pastor for the meat topping.  Bummer.  Not so much flavor.    I will definitely say their contemporary decor and a DJ spinning the tunes as I walk in was definitely a surprise.  I wish they would clean the tables a little more often upstairs though.    I had high hopes and was disappointed.",

It's been great every time, and I highly recommend getting the al pastor meat added to any dish you try. I also get the al pastor on my burrito and have it made the way I want to. The other meats are also decent, the carne asada, lengua, and chicken are okay, but al pastor is the meat to get.  Sometimes they have a live dj playing indoors so it can get loud, but they have upstairs and outdoor seating if you want to lower the noise. They have a salsa cart after you pay where you can get all the sauces you want added to your meal. It's always a great time coming to Taco Y Taco because I know I'll leave happy and full!",

You think tacos are your ally? I was born in them, molded by them. I didn't see a burger until I was already a man.   Okay, maybe I exaggerate a bit but you get the idea. After college I moved to NYC for 4 years for work, the food capital of the world right? Yeah! You would be right except there are NO GOOD TACOS IN ALL OF NEW YORK. I am convinced by this fact. I tried everything to no avail, I resigned myself to my fate of eating asian fusion tacos (bulgogi tacos, kimchi tacos, it was good but... you know).  You can imagine when I moved to Vegas I was excited about being close to my home food again, and it didn't take long for me to stumble on this delectable spot. The tacos here are bomb diggity, especially the al pastor and the shrimp, 2 of my favorites. They have authentic chicharonnes as well as chorizo and any other protein options you can think of. They also have delicious mexican street corn! As others have mentioned, the salsa bar is by far and large the biggest draw, just go easy on the roasted jalapenos :)   The only drawback is its a bit on the expensive side in my opinion. The food quality is outstanding and the service is superb. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area (or even if you're not!)",

I can even understand and speak Spanish enough to get by if I was dropped in the middle of Spain.

But, received Carne Asada Tacos & Chicken Tacos. That's OK though, because I do like both.    Aside from that, the food was actually very very good.

    "text": "Overall good experience here. First walked in with an entire group that was very confused where the line was. So I veered away from them and went to the bar. They served me faster than the people in line. Tacos were a little small, I had to have about 3 to feel full. I had the beef ones and I noticed maybe some pork or uncooked meat was in mine. I couldn't tell, I don't eat pork but it was more red and definitely wasn't beef. This shocked me but I just took it out and continued eating. I eat all organic so this food didn't upset me. It was pretty tasty actually. Very clean and upscale location. Lady I was next to said there's one on tropicana and this one was clearly nicer. They also have a cool upstairs seating area!",

    "text": "My husband and I love taco y taco! We've brought family and friends here and they love it too! Better than Tacos El Gordo! Tacos taste awesome! Great Mexican tasting tacos! Hand made tortillas for the carne asada tacos! The carne asada is actually asada (grilled beef) like it's supposed to be and not cooked in oil, so has that great carne asada taste. My husband likes the al pastor [or adobada] (pork) here cuz it's cooked on a vertical spit just like in Mexico, he says it gives it a certain taste. Here they top it off with pineapple pieces when they serve you al pastor, if you don't want them, just let them know. They have other meats here too, I like the cabeza. They have corn on the cob! They also make fries topped with any meat, you can choose what you want or don't want on them. They make burritos or bowls if you want more of an American chipotle style meal too, you choose what goes on it as well. They do make quesadillas and mulitas too. They also have Jamaica and Horchata drinks, which aren't the home made ones but they're actually not too sweet. There's 4 different lines: one alongside the left  is for the burritos, nachos, bowls, quesadillas, and corn on the cob. The next one says station #1 is the carne asada and chicken line, the following station #2 is cabeza, carnitas, buche, etc, and the last one, station #3 is al pastor... for each line there's a list of what they serve on top so common sense to which line you go to to get what you want (i.e. you can not get a carne asada taco in the al pastor line)",

Majority of it I have never heard of and maybe get a wider range of soda or add tea to drink.   Overall a great and inexpensive place to eat yummy tacos or burritos and street corn. Open late",

I love Mexican food in every form of the word and I am never disappointed when I come here. The street corn and Al Pastor are my favorite by far. My only wish would be that they would give the place a makeover because their attempt at decor is just cheesy. The space has great bones and the potential to be a very chic place.

When you first walk in, the atmosphere of this spot oozes \"chill\" with high backed plush seating areas, family style tables and plenty of TVs covering all your mindless staring needs.  When you approach the ordering area, there's a False impression of cafeteria style service. You actually have to take a moment to read the boards indicating the 3 different lines. I went for a lengua/barbacoa/chicharron plate of tacos, each prepared in various styles. There's a great salsa bar offering 6-8 different styles and garnishes. Also, black and pinto beans are available hot at the bar area gratis. No worries about remembering to order a \"side\". I topped off my taco trifecta with a side of the house guacamole which had the perfect blend of shallots, avocado, tomato, lime and cumin that my tongue looks for. Next I side - stepped to the bar to finish my meal with a Michelada which are sold for $5 all day with your choice of beer. I had to go with my Dos Equis. In all, a great place to get your taco fix with every style of meat available you can think of.",

There were no definitive system for customers to line up in and the employees were far from being friendly...they were unfriendly and rude - no greetings or even a 'how can I help you?'.  Yes, the signs do say 'line 1 al pastor', 'line 2 carnitas...', and so forth but customers around us didn't have a clue hat the process was, line formation interferes with the salsa bar, and if you're up - you proceed to the 'line' that is open even if you don't want the meat that is in that line and can't proceed to said line to order a different meat from a different line.  I specifically ordered al pastor tacos with onion and cilantro ONLY - I got everything on it and the employee proceeded to tell me it is what I wanted pushing the plate towards me and rudely told me if I don't want it he can probably make it again...  I just told him no as it felt like I was already inconveniencing him, he proceeded to wrap my plate up while talking about me to another employee in Spanish.  One, I understand Spanish and two, even if I didn't, it's obvious when someone is talking badly about someone else.  Paying for our food, was not a different story either.  $2.25 for a taco about half the size of an appetizer paper plate is still expensive.  Two stars, for concept, decor, bar option, food item varieties, and flavor of food.",

Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system.   So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?  I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits.   I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.  I'll go look for a taco shop where there's only one line.",

This restaurant is very chill and the experience is the food. Every time I eat here, service improves.   There are two separate counters; one for just tacos and one for everything else. If you are ordering nachos, don't wait at the taco counter because you'll be wasting your time. The taco counter is the first one you see when you enter.   I think this is the best Mexican food in Henderson!!! How they prepare and cook their meats are authentic as you can get. They have the typical meats, like carne asada and barbacoa, but if you are a foodie-type person I highly recommend tasting the chicharron (pig skin) and lengua (beef tongue). You must get their Mexican-style corn on the cob too! My boyfriend loves their barbacoa nachos.",

    "text": "This place can be sort of confusing if it's your first time. Basically, you go to where there are signs saying the type of meat and just wait in line and tell the cook what you want. After getting everything that you wanted, walk over to the cashier and pay. Right in the middle of all this is the condiments bar with a variety of sauces, limes, and etc.  The cashier forgot to ask if I wanted anything to drink ( I had forgotten to even get a drink) before I paid and she decided to ask me after I was walking away. I didn't feel like putting everything down and pulling out my wallet again so no thanks.   The place is 2 stories so if the lower level is full, you can always go upstairs for extra seating. I also noticed it was quite hot in there - maybe their a/c went out.  I went with 3 lengua tacos with everything and that was around $7-8. It was pretty good but didn't fill me up. I might come back to try something else.",

    "text": "Mmmmmmmm good. This was my second time here in 3 days so that must say something. The food is delicious the al pastor is perfect! Not greasy full of flavor and they add pineapple which I love! I've had the pastor on tacos, nachos and in a burrito and it did not fail me. FYI they don't put pineapple on the nachos or burritos but I'm sure if you asked it could be added. I've also tried the carne asada and pollo tacos which were equally as tasty. They have a great salsa bar with not only various salsas but beans, onions and other accompaniments for your meal. Make sure to try the light green sauce Im not sure what it is exactly but it's like an avocado sour cream or something and it's soooo good. Just get a big boat of it and thank me later.   The reason I took off a star is because the ordering system is confusing. There are different stations for different things like one station is just for al pastor tacos and there is another station for carne asada or chicken tacos and another station for burritos/nachos/bowls etc. Also there is usually only one guy running the burrito/nacho/bowl station so the line can get a little backed up as they prepare everything to order. I waited about 10 minutes for a burrito as the lady in front of me ordered 3 nachos and a burrito.... Now I wouldn't normally mind waiting but the tacos I got from a different station were getting cold. I was tempted to eat them in line. All in all if you like tasty Mexican food you should check this place out you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "So I finally got to try this location (Eastern/Richmar) after eating plenty of times at their other location on Tropicana.  Upon walking in my husband and I thought...\"oh they did a nice job with the remodel inside\"...until we sat down and really got a chance to look around.  We sat facing the stairs (right in front of what appeared to be their booths) so this enabled us to see the upstairs.  The curtain appeared to have fallen off.  The front area looked odd...was it a place where people can eat or is it a sort of lobby/waiting area?  Maybe If the place was packed with people it wouldn't look so empty?  The bar area only seats about 4 people...and we thought it was suppose to be somewhat of a bar/restaurant?  The ambience just didn't fit well with the type of food they serve.   Now the kitchen...they did a great job with the remodel of the kitchen as the restaurant before did not have all that kitchen equipment.  It started to make more sense to us once we saw the kitchen...as a lot of money went into getting all that equipment so I'm sure the owners just wanted to open the doors to start recouping some of that money.    Now the food...we were disappointed as it just didn't taste like their other location.  We love the Al Pastor tacos; however, their Al Pastor seemed to be heavily spiced with cinnamon that it over powered even their salsa that they put right on top.  We also had their Barbacoa tacos and the meat was on the chewy side rather than what we're used to with the meat just falling apart easily.  We overheard a lot of new customers confused at where they are suppose to order.  Now I read the other reviews from other yelpers and you'd think they would put up some directions by now as to not upset new customers...but they haven't.  Maybe that will come when they start focusing on the dining areas...  Sorry for the 2 stars...as I do like your tacos (at least the once we had at Tropicana).  I will wait until you all settle in...to try it ince again.",

    "text": "I'm a little disappointed by my beloved taco y taco today. I frequent the original location on Tropicana, but this was my first visit to the new place. While the food is still 5 stars, management really needs to step it up on service and organization.   I saw the advertisement on facebook about the buy 2 tacos get 1 free for Cinco de Mayo for both the 4th and 5th. The advertisement said for the Eastern location only so I thought it would be a perfect time to check out the new digs. When the girl at the register told me the price, I thought it was a little high and asked if she applied the deal. She informed me that the deal was only for the Tropicana location! I told her that's not what the ad said, and I guess a lot of people came in under the same assumption, but she was still not willing to apply the discount. As soon as I got home I checked out facebook again, and they recently posted a new ad listing the Tropicana location, and deleted the old one (clearly trying to cover their tracks). But those tricksters forgot to delete the twitter one that still said Eastern. Good try, but I caught you! Overall, things just aren't running as smoothly at this location as the original, but it's still early so I'll give them some time to work out the kinks.  But like I said, management really needs to get things in order.   Despite my frustration, I can't deny the tacos. Between the 2 locations, I've tried the al pastor, lengua, tripas, carnitas and asada. The al pastor is definitely my favorite, followed by the carnitas and lengua. The asada is just ok, and the tripas was good but they didn't make it extra crispy as I requested.   I'll be back, but I'll probably stick to the Tropicana location for a few more months and give the new place some more time to hopefully get things running more smoothly.",

My hubs had been here before and said his co workers like to frequent this place.  I love me some mexican food so I was down to try it.    Me, I totally thought it was a Chaotic environment.  You know how you order food back in high school, pick a line of the food you want to purchase?  Well that's exactly how they do it here.  My hubs said that's how they ordered back in Cabo, but I've never been.  HINT JESSE N.  This place is very hip and they have been featured in some of Las Vegas' foodie magazines.  So yes, you still should give it a whirl.    I like variety, so if I have to stand in several different lines to get my variety, I know my food will be cold.  That is part of the reason why I gave my 3 star score.  I also still left hungry after eating 3 tacos and a corn.  hahaha, this small girl has a big appetite.",

Reasonable prices($2.25 a taco--the extra change I'm not used to I'll chalk up to the ambiance and alcohol). Having a DJ on the weekends are cool if you want to hang out. Multiple TV's to watch sports are always a plus. Quick service. GREAT salsa bar. Can do small parties upstairs.  Last time I was here they accidentally gave my chicken nachos instead of carne asada.. The guy asked if we didn't mind just piling on the proper meat instead of remaking it. Haaaayyyyy.. the more the merrier.   Only qualms so far:  1. They ran out of limes and served lemons(umm.. what?) 2. Not a fan of their house ale.. but to each their own.",

He was happy, I wasn't...my nachos were so bland, even with some of their salsa added, it didn't help. Luckily the dog doesn't mind bland. Our other problem was with the outside patio, there were 2 doors on the patio but we couldn't use them to get into the restaurant, so every time we needed something we had to go around to the front door. All of the tables were dirty.  My husband said he didn't like the ordering system, where you have to get in a different line for something. I agree, someone is gonna have cold food. I am not planning on returning to this restaurant.",

I came here for the first time while on a business trip to Henderson in April of 2017... before relocating here 6 months later, and had dinner with a few coworkers. At first, ordering is a bit daunting before you learn what and where everything is, but the kitchen staff and cashiers were helpful in navigating. Once you order, they prepare your food right in front of you and you move along the line in no time. My vegetarian coworker was also happy with her options. They seemed to have a problem with people bringing in large containers to take the condiments from the self serve bar.. the cashier had to shoo someone who wasn't even a customer away while I was paying! I must say this hasn't changed much because the bar is still hit or miss if they will be out of your favorite salsas or toppings.  The decor is adorable and they have many seating options including an upstairs if they are full. You can't go wrong with the el pastor and carne asada vampiros or the nachos and the elote corn on the cob. Since moving here, my boyfriend comes here nearly once a week!! We absolutely recommend Taco y Taco for both dine in or take out!!!",

I order tripas, lengua and cabeza. Those are my go too. My wife goes with nachos and you can never go wrong with the corn. Kid friendly a couple of tvs with sports channels on.",

I've tried so many of them, and I can't tell you which one is my favorite. They are all different, and each of them blossom with delicious flavors. If I lived closer, I'd definitely be a regular customer at this taco place. If you love tacos, this is the place to go. If you're new to tacos, this is the place to go. They have different types of tacos, and burritos, and bowls! I'm sure they are all delicious as my stomach isn't big enough to eat it all. I would if I could.   Anyways, good, fairly cheap tacos! I loved them.",

    "text": "I want to let everybody know that there are 4 lines!!! There are four different menus which means there are four different lines.  I usually only get the alpastor tacos. The alpastor line is the last on to the left. The preparer cuts the pastor meat right in front of you. The toppings they put on it are pineapple, onions,  cilantro, and this advocado sauce.   The taco itself is VERY moist. The meat is not dry at all and it combines perfectly with the toppings. The advocado sauce is SPICY. So if you don't like spice I recommend getting your sauce at the sauce/salsa bar.  This place is very clean and they have a full bar. There are two levels of indoor seating and patio seating is also available.   Pricing is not bad. It's $2.25 per taco and I heard they also have specials on taco Tuesday.   If you're in the area and want tacos. This is the place to try.",

    "text": "This food was complete crap, I do not understand any of the complimentary reviews on Yelp. First of all, when I walked in, two ladies that came in together were equally as confused as to how to order, their system is very confusing. The service was terrible, the manager, a pretty hispanic woman and the cashier who both spoke English, conversed in Spanish as I waited to pay my bill (HOW FRIGGIN RUDE IS THAT?) I could have easily walked out without paying due to their confusing, unorganized system and had I known how horrble the food was going to be, I probably should have not paid. Now, for the food, I had an over priced burrito that consisted of  dry and tasteless chicken and the tortilla was not fresh. The portions for 6 dollars is terrible, if I did not purchase nacho chips with this meal, I would have still been hungry. The only good part of my meal was the salsa, they were all tasty.  Then, as I was leaving, there is literature in the entry way telling customers to have an open mind when eating this food and that it is authentic Mexican Food. I have eaten all over the world and this is far from authentic. It is over priced crap food, terrible service and it is rude to speak Spanish in front of customers when you know damn well the customer doesn't understand you. RUDE, RUDE, RUDE, RUDE, I HAVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THIS STORY AND TO NOT EVER EAT THERE. BY THE WAY, AS I WAS LEAVING, I RAN INTO A FAMILY MEMEBER WHO WORKS AT A HAIR SALON IN THIS STRIP MALL, SHE AGREED THAT THE FOOD WAS CRAP AND NOBODY AT HER SHOP LIKES THE FOOD.",

    "text": "Yesterday was my first time trying this place.  I will say that first off portions could be a bit more considering and comparing to competition in the same field.  We ordered takeout for the following:  Burrito for my son who ordered just carne asada and cheese on a flour tortilla.  The flavor of the carne asada is excellent has authentic carbon flavor that you look for.  Cheese was a perfect amount but the homemade flavor of the flour tortilla was lacking.  My grandmother would have criticized this tortilla lol as she would have said, \"no ay no falta sabor\" meaning it lacks flavor.  I agree.  My wife ordered the asada street tacos.  To be authentic street tacos, it should come with TWO tortillas, here they serve them with one.  They are good in size, packed with flavor overall good but needs that second tortilla that I am used to seeing.  I ordered the salad, while it does come in a big black bowl like serving container, it was 1/2 filled.  The gentleman who served was, \"PINCHE\" Spanish for tightwad with the servings.  Mine was served with pinto beans, good overall flavor.  Spanish rice, lacking way lacking in the chicken Knorr flavor that I was looking for and the serving was like 1/2 a serving at best.  Chicken, again VERY PINCHE in the serving probably got 1/8 of a cup in my salad bowl, pico de gallo and lettuce.  I would give this flavor a 4 outta five stars but in portion compared to the $8 ticket price 1.5 stars at best.  Overall I probably will not come back as I can see this restaurant is trying to \"SQUEEZE\" every penny of profit from one customer than to make the volume of customers if they were to either do 1 of 2 things.  Lower the price and keep the portion servings OR Keep the pricing but ante up in portions.  Your competition does way better in this department.  I have to say 2 stars overall for this place.  Flavor is NOT everything if it only last 2-3 bites and your meal is gone.  So a burrito and large drink will set you back around $11-$12 so if you are on a budget, which we all are, this can set you back for $45-$50 for a family of four.  Adios, Taco y taco!!!!  Chipotle is cheaper and portions are bigger and Cafe Rio across the street on Easter is about the same in price but bigger in portions.  Cafe Rio does have the \"authentic\" taste in their flour tortillas that I look for and was raised on.  Happy Eating!!!",

There is also a salsa bar, with house fired and then pickled jalapeno peppers.    The salsa barn also has pinto beans, which are done to perfection slightly firm not mushy, a little creamy.   They have a daily happy hour.  You order at the counter but I prefer to sit at the bar which only has four seats.  The tequila choices are varied and ones you will not find elsewhere the bartender is extremely knowledgeable about the history and origins of the various offerings.  My date enjoyed the corn on the cob cooked Mexican style; it is fire roasted and spices added.  I had chicharon, lingua, and buche.   My favorite is the Buche delicious and tender.   There are several fresh house made salsas including some made with habanero peppers my date loves that flavor, me not so much.   The food is great but the real hidden gem I have found on two visits is the quality of the drinks, fresh squeezed lime juice, and a house made tomato juice concoction to mix in with beer.  They also make two versions of sangrita, one sweet one savory sip a little while doing tequilla shots!",

The carne asada is the cheapest beef they could buy, the ordering process is really really bad, and not planned or thought out very well, the food was dry. The salsa bar was the highlight of the restaurant, but food is not that impressive at all i would pass on this place. I get the whole idea behind trying to give people authentic mexican food  in and upscale setting (Henderson) but this place fails to impress a Cali boy who knows the differance between real Mexican and not so great food. I would rather make the drive over to El Panzon over on Sunset and Sandhill, its a hole in the wall, but you will get great food, or just go to Los Tacos, its much better than this crap.",

TYT Service and Ambiance:  The crew working behind the counter/in the kitchen has always been friendly and works to get your food to you quickly.  The cashiers have been hit or miss in terms of friendliness. There's plenty of seating downstairs, upstairs, the drinks are self service with a mini bar to the side.    There is a major layout issue that affects the experience quickly if they're busy.  There are 4 separate lines for the type of food you're ordering with the salsa bar literally right in the middle 3 of the lines.  When it gets busy, you'll see  dozens of people lined around it ready to order food, while diners with their food are trying to get their salsa bar on.  There's no organization or flow and things can get frustrating quickly if they're busy.  TYT Cuisine:  Overall most of the dishes I've tried have been pretty good.  The Al pastor tacos have always been tasty and the pineapple totally compliments the shwarma pit grilled meat.  Also, I'm a huge fan of their Chicken Quesadillas.  The quesadillas are big in size, flavor and they're pretty generous with the chicken stuffed in there.  If the salsa bar in the middle of the line logistics really needs to be fixed.  Once it's moved just mark off where the lines should be on the floor and this would help immensely with the overall customer experience.  With so many great taco options in Vegas, TYT is A-OK and has potential for much more.  Enjoy!",

They sacrifice the taste to push out tacos because of the demand. Use to be good back in the day, will not be returning. They look So good while you wait for them and from the pictures you see on yelp but they are disappointing. Our tacos were also cold by the time we sat down.",

    "text": "Seriously?! This place is overly hyped and I'm here to report- it's not that great. To the people that were standing in front of me in line bragging and bragging 'bout coming to this place once a week- you're wasting your money, yo!   First of all, getting in line to actually place your order is a complete $hit$how. I totally wish I took a picture but walking in around 12ish- people are standing in front of these unorganized lines waiting to order or in line to pay, idk..so I'm the newbie asking the people what they're in line for but I get the stink eye? So weird&annoying at the same time. After a few minutes, I finally was pointed to the right line and I placed my order: carne asada burrito, no beans, both rice (spanish & lemon cilantro), pico salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese and lettuce. After a few minutes I was at the register paying; $8.23 for one carne asada burrito, just the burrito- no drink.   They have a salsa bar (in a horrible spot) in the center of the restaurant which offers 3 salsas, plus an avocado cream sauce. All salsas are pretty tasty, I'll give them that. It gets crowded around the salsa bar, so watch out.   Let's talk food. The carne asada was dry and SALTY; you can tell they don't cook it in lard. I like my carne asada dripping in juice with a little bit of fat pieces this is seriously where the flavor lives! The rice was okay. The pico salsa was okay. Everything was just, meh-okay. I'm going to force myself to eat the other half for dinner tonight, because I really don't want to eat it, but I also don't waste food.   Still on the hunt for a good carne asada burrito in the valley...",

First off, they do not answer their business phone lines (they have two lines) and I was trying to call them a week prior for a catering order for my baby shower and no one answered. Like I called the whole day and eventually went to the eastern location at 8pm on a Tuesday night.   I got there and it was understandably busy which I ended up just managing my frustrations and ordering. They were kind and took my order. I was given confirmation, a receipt and had an agreement that my order will be ready by Saturday morning for me to pick up. That morning I tried to call their business (11am) as they instructed me to pick it up at 1pm. It was already pushing it since my baby shower was at 3pm that day... low and behold... no one answers both phone numbers given, then to make shit worse my fiancee goes there at 12:30 to pick up he order to find that the manager \"has no documentation of the order\" meaning THEY DID NOT KNOW WHY HE WAS THERE?\" Apparently the staff was dumbfounded about the \"alleged catering order.\"  I did not want to lose my shit and go into labor so I told my fiancee to deal with it and ask them to place an order and ask why they never answer the phone. No reply or excise except they can \"have my order ready by 3pm\" LOL my baby shower is at 3pm?   The only good thing they remedied the situation was wave the delivery fee and had to food 15 min before my guests arrived. Never again will I order catering from this place. I love their food so I will continue to go there but not expect much more than the minimal.",

We have previously been to this place when it was empty.  For whatever reason,  we were served one taco and never got another chance to order any other dish.  20+ minutes of wait time,  we walked off.   The vampiro is the only memorable, fairly decent, but slightly salty dish.  The lengua, pork,  steak and chicken taco were all lack luster. The guacamole tasted more like fillers than avocado. Not worth it,  but at least we finally tried it.  The ordering system is quite slow and by the time you pay,  the tacos are cold.    To each his own, I rather endure the lines and drive to Tacos El Gordo.",

I'm talking tons of space, and they serve alcohol :D I came just as they were having their 5-7 pm HH ($3 for a Corona light and $4 for a Michelada). The way you order the taco is the same process as El Gordo where each meat has it's own station. I absolutely loved their salsa bar with tons of sauce and spicy veggie options (#1 game changer for me). The only con I have to say about this place is that the lengua taco needs to be less dry, more tender and don't just assume that I want pineapple on my taco (ew!).   However, their al pastor and cabeza tacos were delicious *cry*. I wish I can eat tacos everyday and not gain weight. The cherry on top of this entire place was that they serve ELOTE!!! I repeat guys, they have ELOTE here. Thank you so much for existing Taco y Taco (:",

The marinade was not as good as I expected, had a weird smell to it.  I recommend their lengua and tripas, make sure you ask the guy to dip the tripa back in the fryer for an extra minute. Decent salsa bar and  Service was good. I would go back, but not ordering the al pastor again.",

Although 2 out of 3 of the tacos I had were a bit dry, the flavors were delicious and the sauces saved them.   The al pastor seems like a favorite here. They cut the pork in front of you and top it with pineapples, which is super delicious and adds a contrast with salty and sweet flavors. The pork was a bit dry but was still good, especially with the spicy pastor salsa from the salsa bar.   The carne asada was also quite dry but was a solid choice. It was marinated well and the guacamole on top made it better. The beef was sliced thinner than I am used too but it made each bite work.   My absolute favorite is the lengua. It's moist, tender, and so flavorful. It works well with the avocado sauce and just melts in the mouth. To some, it may be fatty but it was balanced well with the toppings and the homemade tortillas.   Along with these, I tried a bit of the chorizo, which also was dry. It had a lot of spices, though, so it was still very good. The service is very friendly and helpful, and there is plenty of seating. I didn't get to see the upstairs area, but downstairs was elegant and clean.",

The girl working the register was sucking down her boba tea while ringing me up then wanted to complain when I made a comment about the price when she said $19!!! She even went as far as saying she canceled the food cause it's \"too much\" I will never be back for this over priced Mexican food with the rudest customer service in the shopping center",

    "text": "Yelp told me to go here.  Yelp said I would like it.  Yelp was right.    First of all the space that housed this restaurant was very clean and very large.  In fact, there was a 2nd floor with more tables that overlook the entire area.  The decor was nice.  The staff greets you when you walk in and the staff behind the counters were also very friendly.   There were separate aisles or stations if you may call it that where you order your food.  We had the vampiro al pastor which was pretty much pork with all the toppings, sandwiched between two crunchy corn tortillas.   My wife described the taste of the pork as if eating sweet bbq sparerib meat.  I can go with that.    We also had standard tacos, filled wither either chicken or steak.  While okay on its own, their amazing toppings bar brought the tacos up a few notches.   Imagine Roberto's but with 3 x more stuff.  So many types of hot sauces, grilled onions, beans, etc.   I really liked their options here.  Their carne asada fries were a bit underwhelming and a bit over priced.  That was probably the only miss about this place.  To top it all off, we ordered one of their elotes.  It was seasoned in chili powder, butter, and cheese.  Loved it.  Satisfied with this joint, Taco y taco will be my go to when I want some authentic tasting Mexican food!",

The restaurant feels full of promise with experience but falls short on the food in my opinion. The tacos are not as flavorful as I had anticipated. They use a similar concept to tacos el Gordo where there are different lines for different styles of tacos. The only problem I have at locations with this concept is your first set of tacos are cold by the time you are done getting other tacos- or for that matter anything else. Same idea if you order burritos or other hot items you order it at counter and stand around for quite a while waiting for your food to be ready. The only item I order there is carne Asada fries.",

    "text": "This place is located on the left (north) part of the lot and this is probably one of the most heavily trafficked lots in Henderson.  If it is I'm sure this restaurant is one of the main reasons. It's 7pm on Saturday and its a PACKED HOUSE. Don't worry you'll get a seat upstairs or downstairs. There's even a party of about 20 celebrating something. It would be cool to sit near the railing to look down on the chaos.   Yes its chaotic here. The inside is as huge as the outside lets off. There are about 4 separate lines for things I have never heard of. I had to ask a couple of regulars what was what so I knew where to stand. It looked like one line but I guess one line was just real popular.  This is where I deduct a star. It could be better managed. Maybe have a greeter direct newbies or good signage but definitely a better system of ordering. I was waiting along the salsa bar the whole time I waited and inevitability was in someone's way haha. The lines or the salsa bar need to be rearranged. I suggest it be put against a wall but I couldn't tell you where.  It definitely looks like mass confusion.  When it came time for me to get my salsa there was someone in line in MY way lol. For anybody that cares it's colder upstairs then it is downstairs and they carry liquor.   They have Barbacoa but not just that. There's like 3 or 4 types of beef I've never heard of lol. There's also like 3 or so types of pork.  I guess I'm saying you'll have meat options.  The place definitely gives off a factory vibe where they are pushing out tons of product. I do have to say they are efficient with the food.  The food is definitely good and the salsa bar is also good but both aren't excellent and could be improved.  My wife thought the Carnitas were flavorless but the Barbacoa had plenty of spice.  The value is excellent and the choices are OK.  Overall I would say this is a good place to eat and with a few tweaks here or there it could definitely earn five stars from me and I'm sure others as well.   OK I'll shut up now",

Highly recommend getting a vampiro - it was my first time having one and the crispy shells are so satisfying - and also a sleeper hit was the fish tacos, which is light and fresh grilled whitefish.  The al pastor is the real star and you should hit up that line repeatedly and often. I also had the buche, which wasn't as tender as I've had before and also quite salty, and the suadero (always pleased to get brisket) tacos. I wish they had horchata or an agua de fresco on site but the grapefruit Jarritos went down easy, and you can get craft beers! Nice atmosphere, a little sterile than I'm used to for tacos, but that's not a bad thing as you really do feel like you can linger and get some more tacos without worrying about parking or crowds.",

Taco Y Taco was one of our favorite spots to frequent, as it was close to home and we loved a lot of their menu offerings, especially the tacos.  It is my understanding that the family who owns and operates this restaurant was also in the butcher business, which makes sense... there was something different about the meat here.  It WAS good.  The other night, we happened to be  in our old stomping grounds and were too excited to have the tacos we missed so much.  But we were disappointed.  Not sure if it was just an off night, but the meat lacked flavor, and didn't have the nice charred flavor of a grill that we remembered.  It instead tasted steamed or boiled even.    The place always seems unnecessarily chaotic, and we never minded it.  We can tolerate a less than stellar atmosphere if the food is great.  However, the fact that they missed the mark with our order had us wanting to leave quickly.    Not sure if we will be back again.",

We are both Mexican food junkies and suckers for good Al Pastor.  The place is larger than you might think.  The flow of the restaurant is a little off, and ordering is a bit confusing.  You would think everyone would get a tray and start at station 1, but it didn't seem to work that way.  Folks were \"cutting in line\" at other stations and it seemed to slow things up.  Station1 was the Al Pastor, and I tried two of them.  Watching the prep told you how authentic it was and how awesome it was going to taste.  Station 2 was other proteins/preparations, like Carne Asada and Carnitas. I tried one of the Carnitas.  The prep cook pulled a nice chunk out of a bath of juice, chopped it up and piled it high.  On to station 3, where you could get burrito bowls, Mexican corn and other side.  One Mexican corn for me.  Oh, and beer on tap and in the bottle.  One cold bottle of Modelo.  Does this sound like a feast or what?  On to the salsa bar, which includes warm beans.  I wanted a better selection of salsa, and larger cups to put it into.  The tacos were wonderful.  The tortillas were perfect, with just a few seconds on the grill.  The meat was so flavorful.  The corn was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The prices were right.  This is the real deal.  I'll be back.",

In other words: a major upgrade!  It's about 3-4x the size of the first restaurant and includes an upstairs dining area, which is great for larger parties. The menu is the same (with the exception of the drink menu, of course) and service is still stationary, where you approach separate counters for different things, but is just as friendly. Don't be afraid to ask questions!  On special occasions, like Cinco De Mayo, they have live mariachi music & awesome specials. They also run sweet deals during their daily 5-7 PM Happy Hour and every Tuesday, aka TACO TUESDAY! Which has $2 al pastor or chicken street tacos, $2 cheese quesadillas, & cheap drinks.",

This time I tried the elote (corn on the cob). Make sure to get it with everything on it! The al pastor too - the pineapple counter acts the heat and makes it so good!  The lines seem to confuse everyone though. At each window, you find a different kind of taco/food. So just pay attention otherwise you'll be in the wrong line.

When my girlfriend mentioned that we were headed to meet friends for dinner and we were going to Taco y Taco, I imagined the normal small taco shack with great food as you would find at their other location, with underwhelming decor.   I was overwhelmed when I entered Taco y Taco on Eastern. This place is big, two levels with plenty of seating and you'll want to spend some time here.  It has a nice ambiance with cool modern chandelier lighting and dark accents.  It's a surprise that their tacos are still only 2.25!?!  We sat at the bar waiting for friends.  We had some happy hour beers and the bartenders were super nice.  Once we got around to eating, we went through the taco bar.  I had 3 tacos: one al pastor, a carne and a carnitas.  My fave of the 3 was the carnitas.  I wasn't overly impressed by the al pastor.  I've definitely had better.  My gf had tripa, lengua and an al pastor.  She seemed to enjoy them and had the same feelings about the al pastor. This is definitely a great spot for something quick, something slow and some late night dining.  Enjoy!",

I meant to take a picture but it looked so yummy I totally forgot! We will definitely be back!",

We got a side of chips and guac which were plain and it turned brown pretty fast. We obviously had to try the street corn. I don't even like corn and it was sooooo good. cheesy and a little spice YUM YUM!   There really isn't anything to comment about the service because they don't really wait on you after you leave the food stations. It is also pretty nice that they have a bar there.",

Our bar tender, Jose, was incredible! Very attentive, gave us all kinds of samples, really friendly!! Their food, also incredible!! We tried the al pastor taco (meat, onions, cilantro and pineapple)...not a huge pork fan, but it was super tasty! Also tried one of their carne Asada bowls, yummy!! The one downside of the bowl was the cheese. It was pretty much the Kraft shredded fiesta mix you can buy at the grocery store. The carne Asada was great though!! Not fatty and very flavorful. My girlfriend got the chips and guacamole. Not a huge fan myself, but was definitely impressed. The guacamole was filled with cilantro and chunks of tomato. The chips were homemade and warm when they came out.  Overall, was very impressed and can't wait to come back again!!!",

You start over on the opposite end of the cash register, order your tacos, move over and order your sides, bowls, etc., then pay. It's a fast and easy system.  Their salsa bar is awesome, with salsas and condiments to fit any taste. My only recommendation would be to put labels somehow on the salsas for those who don't know salsas and accidently dump the wrong kind on their food. For those of us who can tell them apart, you'll be fine.  Their beer taps aren't turned on yet, so if you want beer, they have bottles. You can also get mixed drinks later in the day (their manager said the bartender didn't come in until later).  The tacos are tasty, and if you don't like cilantro, onions and guacamole on them, tell them in advance. I wish they put a little more meat in them, but for $2.25 a taco, you can't go wrong.",

Best part is the restaurant being only a block away from where I live so I don't have to drive all the way up north for damn good tacos.  Located at the former Republic Kitchen & Bar establishment along South Eastern Blvd, this is definitely one of the better looking taco shops out there.  I like how the new occupants kept the same floor plan from the old bar and added few Latin modifications to suit their concept.  Plenty of seats downstairs, upstairs and even outside.    This place has several stations for certain cuts of meats from which you can order any way you desire: taco, burrito, nachos, fries, bowl, and vampiro.  Salsa bar is also impressive with various sides and 8 different sauces!!  Thirsty? They have a full bar and an extensive list of beer on tap or in a bottle.  Happy hour is from 6-8 p.m. daily with live mariachi on Mondays and DJ spinning on weekends.  I always get tacos with cabeza (head), lengua (tough) and chicharron (skin) anywhere I go so I had to try them out from this place.  The first two were quite tasty and really tender.  As far as the chicharron, they actually add crispy pork rinds which was a first since other taquerias normally just serve the taco with soggy pork skins.  What also got me hyped up is the fact that they have elotes since I no longer have to track down this dude who sells them from a shopping cart!!  Overall, Taco Y Taco is one of the best Mexican joints in the valley.  I would give them six stars if I could.",

Great seating and looks very clean but the meat was luke warm and the guacamole was flavorless, if not unappetizing. The Mexican street corn was pretty beat as well--Cattle corn boiled too long and again kept luke warm. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and this place has been disappointing both times I have come. The price point is also relatively high to other great taco restaurants. I gave them 2 stars purely for the cleanliness.",

My other favorite here is their carnitas tacos, those are pretty amazing! The salsa bar could be a little better. When you order chips and salsa, make sure you ask for fresh ones.... they tend to be hours old and stale- best to ask for a new batch. Great atmosphere, customer service is pretty good.",

They also sell Mexican street corn, too, but beware - if you want it cut off of the cob they charge you an extra $2 just for that.  The tacos were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The meat was nicely accompanied by lettuce, pico, and a spicy sauce (chipotle maybe). So for 8 tacos, Mexican corn, and a coke, it came to about $35. Kind of steep, but you get what you pay for here.

When you walk in there is a line that no one has any idea what line they are in. The first two are for tacos, but if you want a burrito or fish tacos you have to go to another line.  They tell you to go there but then you pass 10 people and I feel like I'm cutting everyone in line.  Everyone stood and looked at each and was  like what line are we in? Once you get to that line your suppose to be in, they don't speak English.  I ordered a carne asade burrito, and they tried to give it to someone else. I told them that's mine and he said ohhhh, and had to open it, but looked at me weird cause he did not speak English!  I would give them a 1 star but the food is amazing! Great prices too! Just really confusing.  We also came on a Tuesday night and damn if there wasent 50 kids running around up and down making a ton of noise!",

But the staff was really nice explaining how everything worked. We even got samples of a  few different types of meat!   After 20 minutes of indecision we went with Lengua(Tongue), Cabeza(Cheek meat), Al Pastor (Pork), and Asada tacos, along with an Al pastor bowl. We also tried all of their salsas and extras, and EVERYTHING was delicious! Their al pastor specifically was excellent, and the lengua and cabeza tacos were also great! We regretted not getting the mexican street corn since it seemed like everyone ordered it.   Definitely coming back since it's delicious food at a reasonable price.

Based on my current experience, Taco Y Taco is one the best places to get those authentic street tacos. It's like a fancier, more upscale Tacos El Gordo. It's very clean and there's a lot of seating, even a second floor and outside patio (both of which I've never sat at but would like to eventually).   Ordering is simple: you stand in the line that corresponds to the type of meat you want. It's about $2 to $2.50 for a taco. Then move down the line if you want anything extra like chips & guac, a burrito, elotes (yummy, yummy street corn), or carne asada fries!   You get your drinks at the register. They have an abundance of drinks in a bottle from the bar, cans of soda, or just the fountain drinks.   They also have a sauce bar with a non-spicy avocado sauce, hot habanero or hot pastor, and about three other sauces. So many options, all delicious.   I love coming here for tacos and will keep coming back.",

The mushroom ones come with cheese and grilled mushrooms and have these savory greasy (in a good way!) flavor and sauce that runs out when your eating.   The soyrizo is spicy and \"meaty\" and you can add whatever other toppings to make it how you like.  The avocado sauce at the free salsa it creamy and tops off the spicy dishes.   The corn here is the best I've ever had, no nonsense and just done right. Same goes for the horchata which is creamy and sweet and tastes homemade not like the bottled version you can get at other places.",

Well, it was the latter  I proceeded to pull out of my mouth about a 2in piece of what they said was plastic from the meat or tortilla wrapper. They refunded my money and I went to sit down and finish my other tacos, but had lost my appetite.

When I very nicely said that I wanted them plain he very rudely responded that I never told him and that he was going to treat me however he wanted to, very aggressively. The level of aggression I received from this taco man by the name of Alex (Alejandro) Is like I haven't experienced before. I tried to complain to the manager before I left because he ruined my meal, and I was told he was the manager. I asked to speak to the owner and was told he rarely visits. I am writing this review so the owner is aware of the poor level of service that is offered at his establishment. Honestly the tacos aren't worth the lack of customer service.",

The set up is kind of like a food court where you form a line at the area where you'd like to purchase whatever you're craving. These sections are split by meat and then you can choose whether you want it in a taco or other when you get to the front. As the lines get long at peak time, this is not particularly convenient for individuals as you line up a while for one thing, then for another and before you know it, you're good is cold and it's 15 mins later. Thankfully as I was with my partner, he took one line and I took another. I'd definitely split up because unlike a buffet, there aren't as many sections, so you just have to wait and it gets pretty saturated with people in the same area. Drinks are another line so you do this in parts, but the bar area is in the same area where you pay and where you can get sides, such as elote. The food itself is very good. Great flavours, good amount of meat and the elote is large and fresh. The music is also really fun and adds to a great vibe. Staff are friendly at the tills but they don't come around often enough to clear areas from the previous diners. If it wasn't for the food, I'd give this place 3 stars but if you're looking for some good tacos and music in a casual dining space, give it a go!",

    "text": "Tacos are undeniably delicious. Don't forget to try their loaded nachos as well. The concept of this restaurant is perfect for a quick casual dinner. You walk up essentially as if its a food truck and order your food. There are so many options-its truly hard to decide which one to order. They make it as you order. It's ready in like a minute.   They have a salsa bar in the middle of the restaurant. I noticed they seem to run out of salsa containers fast. Pro tip: use the free water cup for some salsa if they run out of containers.   There is plenty of seating in the restaurant--they also have some seating upstairs. I wish they would add lighting to some parts of the restaurant though because its a bit dark in some areas. But otherwise, taco y taco always has delicious food, a fun atmosphere and decent prices.",

    "text": "Takeaways here:  Tacos are great, Exceptionally worthy Is the al pastor.  We ordered a variety sampler, Barbacoa, pupil, asado, alpastor, bowl, taco, gran taco, corn.  The only thing that stood out is the al pastor taco because it had pineapples and cheese which gave it a sweet salty flavor. The other meats and tacos taste relatively similar especially the marinated ones.  They put similar toppings so it's hard to distinguish.  The asado meat had a good texture next to the al pastor. But it was all very tasty and good.  Final thoughts, there could be some improvements and it would be a 5 star. - weird system, slow, inefficient.  Got 50% of our order wrong and to be honest I can't tell if any of the orders was actually right or what was supposed to be in it.  The people behind the counter just basically put on whatever they liked.   - food got cold by the time I went through the harrowing line system -dirty looking.   With the stations behind and the cooking vats things looked quite disorganized and questionable cleanliness. - not many people cleaning the tables.  Goods - packed even at 4pm on a Saturday, a non prime time -the atmosphere is really likeable.  Nice colors, open airyness, nice Spanish music.  Reminds of a cool place to hang out and have some beers with friends  That's about it.  I would come back for the atmosphere and al pastor taco.  Would give it a higher rating if they somehow fix the food system.  Final note:  yes it feels a bit pricy, but this is prime real estate on eastern, rent isn't cheap either.",

Other than that, I have nothing but great things to say about Taco Y Taco!  Their food is great, the drinks are amazing, the place is super clean, and the overall atmosphere is very fun and chill.

    "text": "Overall: If you want to go to a Mexican eatery that is good but slightly more upscale, this is the place to go. It keeps the vibe of places like Tacos El Gordo, but the decor is way nicer and is closer to a bar than a taco stand.  Food: 4  Quesadilla: Their quesadillas are decent sized and stuffed with cheese and meat. They will usually ask if you wan guacamole and sour cream inside the quesadilla, but sometimes they forget and you have to ask. I've tried it with cabeza, carne asada, and shrimp, and my all time favorite is probably the shrimp. I'm not a big fan of shrimp, so that says a lot.  Tacos: My favorites are the carne asada, cabeza, and lengua. Their carne asada is good but pretty standard. The cabeza is fatty and juice, and the lengua is pretty well cooked.  Carne Asada Fries: Tasty but not much better than any typical Mexican eatery. In fact, I feel like the carne asada put in these fries isn't as tasty as other places.  In my opinion, it's not really worth it to pay for me the vampiro or mulita but it's up to you.  Service: 3.5  The workers are pretty nice, but the guys making the taco can get a bit of an attitude if you ask for things on flour tortilla. In fact, sometimes they will just tell you that they don't have anymore, even if you can find them at a different meat station. I get that it interrupts their workflow since they don't usually have them on hand, but I think that's something that should be fixed.  Ambiance: 4  Taco y Taco almost has the decor of an upscale Mexican cantina. There's plenty of space to sit on the two level restaurant, and there are even some seats at the bar if you want a drink with your tacos.",

    "text": "Freaking great Baja taco joint. I like their 4-line ordering system, and I like even more that they hold their patrons accountable when someone tries to jump in a shorter line and then order something from a more popular station.  We first stopped by for a light dinner before heading into town. I had the lengua and the cabeza tacos, both of which were incredibly tender and flavorful. I also got to sample the al pastor, and that was excellent as well. The tortillas were sturdy and had a discernible corn flavor, and the avocado crema (available at the large station of sauces) was absolutely delicious. My friends got me hooked on the mulas ($4), or filling sandwiched with cheese between two soft tacos, but the tacos ($2.25) are great too. I've had better vampiros ($4) elsewhere - the oil tasted a bit stale to me, but I'm also very sensitive to that sort of thing.   Anyways, I enjoyed dinner so much the first night, I made my friends take me back a second time, and it was just as great as my first experience.  I will say the 4-line system works better if you come as a group so everyone can divide and conquer. Especially when they're busy, it can take a very long time to move through the line so it's really not worth it for one person to stand in two lines. That being said, the taqueros are incredibly efficient and each order is made just about as fast as is humanly possible. Come hungry and come with friends - you're in for a treat.",

Cooked to perfection with nice char and amazing flavor, and a couple times there's no char or caramelization and it just ruins it.  I am a huge fan of their tacos de tripas (intestines)!! I ask for them to make it crispy and it's literally heavenly! I like different textures so I order a vampiro de Asada to complete my order. The crunch, cheese, asada flavor, and fresh guacamole is out of this world!   They have lots of beverages to choose from.

I ordered 5 al pastor tacos. However, by the second taco, there was already a large grease puddle on my plate. I couldn't eat anymore of it knowing I was consuming all that fat. I didn't even want to give it to my son, so all he ate while we were there was the Cheerios I had packed in my bag. The meat was flavorless and boring. And the pineapple on top of the tortillas wasn't even ripe yet. Note to the customers, this is not what real street tacos taste like.   The place was a mess when we showed up. There was trash and food all over the floor, the salsa bar was a mess and the garbage bins were so full. There was a young man going around cleaning everything, but the place was getting messy faster than he could clean. Maybe an extra person cleaning would be beneficial to keeping the place up.   And what the heck happened to the salsa bar? The radishes were old and brown? And who's bright idea was it to use the mandolin to cut them with a zig zag blade? They were soggy and thin. I hate wasting food but I threw out a whole bowl of the radishes because they were just gross. And the avocado salsa I used to love so much tasted like straight mayonnaise.   What happened to you Taco Y Taco? You used to be so good. You have lost a customer for life.",

Second off, you end up waiting in multiple lines. MULTIPLE LINES. You want a side? That's one line? Tacos from different taco lines? Other lines. Paying? ANOTHER LINE.   Then the food was mediocre at best. The meat was tough and not super flavorful. Portions were decently sized for the price. The chips and salsa were honestly the best part of my meal. I got 2 tacos, chips & salsa, and a Jarritos soda. After waiting in multiple lines, it probably didn't help my feelings toward the food either.   The service was decent, but due to the way the lines are set up, talking to the people cutting the meat & making the tacos... I could barely hear them. I had to ask the guy to repeat himself 3x because it was damn near impossible to hear over the other lines + the noise of the restaurant.   The decor is nice and there is a good amount of seating, but that was really the best part of this place. I don't think I'll be returning. It wasn't worth the headache of standing in lines on lines on lines for mediocre at best food.",

This place was packed on a Sunday evening.  We were either super hungry since we just went swimming at the lake or the tacos were really good but inhaled it in less than a minute. LOL Jk the tacos were alright. The al pastor looked like it was already pre-carved and the meat's consistency and moisture was near that of beef jerky. The sauce they put on it and pineapple, I guess makes up for the dryness.   Otherwise, the bathrooms were pretty clean and the service was quick.  I would come back if I was starving on this side of town again.",

I always go for Carne Asada, Carnitas, and the Barbacoa with the habanero sauce.   A lot of people go for the Al Pastor but it really isn't my favorite meat. If you're in a drinking mood, make sure to get their homemade Michelada with their Taco y Taco lager which comes from my favorite local brewery Joseph James.   I'm drooling just trying to figure out when I can get back next!",

The food was mediocre at best. Meats were overtly salty, guac was more onion versus avocado, it all didn't taste fresh.  I should have started with visiting the ladies room first and I would have left immediately. Not only did it have a strong odor of backed up sewage, it was filthy. I decided not to even go in the stall, it was that bad. I washed my hands and wedged my foot in the door to not touch it while leaving. Grosssssssss!",

Open till 2am on the weekends which might save you from making a mistake at a place like Roberto's. Fill your drunk belly up with some tacos and maybe one more beer instead.

We ordered Al pastor and chicharones tacos, with mole fries.   The food was good but since we were waiting to go through each station, by the time we paid our food was warm instead of hot. The food was delicious and the ingredients were fresh except we wished the chicharones was crispier. I'm assuming since we came in late the crispiness was gone over all.  There is seating everywhere.

    "text": "Taco Y Taco: because I'm an equal opportunity carnivore and will happily nom down all parts of the cow, not just the \"normal\" meats.  I may be picky sometimes, but when it comes to meats, I try to be an adventurous eater, particularly when visiting one close friend of mine in Vegas who is like.... Andrew Zimmern status. We had been debating between going to Taco Y Taco or Tacos El Gordo (which I have been to, many years ago) this visit, but Taco Y Taco was the obvious choice when it was decided I needed to try the cabeza tacos.  We arrived around 5:30-6 on a late Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Lots of reviewers have complained about how confusing and complicated the ordering system is with the three lines, and I do see that when it's busy, but since there were no others in line when we went, it was a breeze. We went to the one line we needed, but while there, the guy making our tacos asked if we wanted anything from either of the other two lines while we were there.  My friend ordered 6 tacos - 3 cabeza (head) and 3 tripas. Get the tripas crispy! It makes it the texture of super light, crispy fried chicken skin! Normally, when found in pho or at Korean bbq, i hate tripe, but my friend had be try a piece and crispy in these tacos, I loved it.  I got 3 tacos for myself - cabeza, suadero (meat from between the cow's belly and leg) and lengua (tongue).  The cabeza was great, but the pieces of meat were shredded so, so tiny, it was hard to get a real meaty flavor amidst the onions and cliantro in the taco. This was the one meat that I added some salsa to, but it complimented it perfectly. SIDEBAR: the salsa bar is huge! I'm a big baby for spicy stuff so I only tried one mild salsa, the chunkiest one on the end closest to the taco lines) and it was really great with the cabeza. I also didn't want to get much salsa since I wanted to really just savor the flavor of the meats I was eating.  I had never had nor tried suadero before walking into Taco Y Taco. I was curious as to what it was, and upon seeing where in the cow it was from, I knew I had to try it. I love fish bellies and pork belly, why wouidn't I like cow belly? It was tender and sweet and flavorful. I could have easily had a few suadero tacos. No salsa necessary.  Lengua, sweet, sweet lengua, meat of my dreams. Beef tongue is one of my favorite meats at any Korean bbq (when it's available) and lengua tacos are probably my favorite street tacos. Lengua is such a smooth, melt in your mouth meat that I just want to feed it to all my friends (without telling them what it is first so that they aren't scared). Next time I'm here I'll get at least 3 of these :)  I can't wait to come back to Taco Y Taco the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Moving from San Diego where there is an abundance of delicious Authentic Mexican food, to Vegas where the authenticity seems sparse, I was thrilled to find a nice place to call my new go to Mexican food restaurant.   My first experience here couldn't have been  any better. The staff was friendly and attentive and offered us various samples of their succulent meats. The Cochinita Pibil tacos...mah-gawd!! Absolutely superb...you must try it!! The meat was seasoned to perfection and left me salivating for more. Another must try is there elote; a traditional Mexican corn on the cob slathered in butter, parmesan cheese and chili. I seriously could eat this every day.   The ambience is nice and clean, very modern and cozy. They have a full bar and large selection of beers (I went with my traditional Corona). The menu also extends to include various salads, burritos, and sides.   I definitely can't wait until my next Taco y Taco experience and the million more visits I plan to make!! Ayayayay!!

    "text": "First impressions this place was nice and clean! Eastern is always poppin with food places. My friends love this place and wanted to bring me. So i came and i could not decide what to order!!! I had such a hard time but i finally chose the carne asada fries because that is what everyone said was really good. I LOVE CARNE ASDA FRIES. Right now i am working to become a Ranch connoisseur. And after i aspire to be a carne asada fries connoisseur. So i chose that and i was not a fan at all. I would not order the fries again. Two stars because I did not like the actual fries because they were too potatoey and felt undercooked. I did not think the meat had much flavor, and even the guacamole was just bland. So i was very disappointed. I know what you guys are thinking \"why would you get carne asada fries at a taco place?\" That is a fair point but even so I would expect any item on the menu to be good. I think the restaurant is only good as their weakest dish. Idk i think it makes sense. The meat on my fries still gave me an idea what their meat tastes like overall. I am still willing to come back and try some other menu items, i do want try some tacos but for now i am not a fan.",

    "text": "Where do I begin with this place. The ordering system is the worst system I've ever seen in a restaurant! Multiple lines depending which items you want to order. Nothing like getting some al pastor tacos in one line and watching and holding your food as you wait in another line to get carnitas tacos. Food looks good, but eating cold food I paid around $30.00 and waited 30 minutes to sit down and eat is ridiculous!!! It wasn't even that busy! It got way busier as I was eating my food and could only imagine how cold their food would be. I'm sure the food would of been better had it been hot or even warm for that matter. It's the most inefficient restaurant I've ever seen. I speak from 20 years of restaurant management. I didn't see any manager on the floor or helping out, but I also couldn't tell any distinguishing clothing that would indicate a manager. The girl in the bar area was just standing and texting on her phone. It was 5pm when I went. Everyone was slammed and that girl seemed like she could've helped. Large inside and nice looking. Pretty clean inside. Salsa bar is nice, but should have pico de gallo on the salsa bar as an option. Even after ordering all my food the line to pay took even more time. 3 fricken lines to just order my food and pay. The cashier struggled to input my order with her tablet. I told her my order and she looked at me like I was stupid. Like she didn't trust me or something. I repeated my order again to her and she seemed to trust me then. It was pretty simple. 4 al pastor tacos, 4 carnitas tacos, and 1 al pastor vampire taco plus 2 drinks. This ordering system needs to change!!! I can't believe people go there paying a lot of money for small tacos that are cold. I could of gotten my food and sat down and not paid they were so lost and clueless. I'm an honest person and paid of course. Had I been a young punk I would of not paid back in the day. Instead I feel as if I was the one getting robbed of service and hot food. If you go there, go when you're the only one in that place. I feel I could give this place 4 stars, but the rest of my experience brings this down to 1 star. Of course I feel as if this review will fall on deaf ears and they will continue to operate in the fashion they already do.",

I mean,  I love the flavors of tacos El gordo,  but I don't like the ambiance,  it's the  ghetto side of town,  the loud obnoxious music playing in the background,  and I don't like being starred at by men with mouths open and gawking eyes.   Taco y taco is fun,  with a small bar,  where you can order mixed tequila Drinks, and beer. There is an upstairs area for larger parties or special occasions.  I would definitely come back and get my taco fix.",

The chorizo taco was also slammin!   They have great micheladas, and an extensive tequila menu.  Oh, I almost forgot the Mexican corn on the cob, order this!!!!!!  The corn on the cob was so freakin good, great amounts of cheese and spice.   The best part was our friendly bartender, he was so cool and friendly. I was at the bar alone with him for a bit and he was attentive and knowledgeable about tequila and cocktails. I love great service and friendly servers. They make the meal sometimes. And he made my time at this place memorable.  This place is gonna be my \"go to\" spot for tacos!",

Understandable that the line was long due to it being Cinco de Mayo, but that was not the case at all for the line with Elotes/seafood. They had 2 employees working the line and one of which was filling up the containers (when they were already full) to avoid helping other customers, making the line longer and clearly preventable. The man who took my order was trying to multi task but I eventually got tired of waiting for my tacos so just purchased my elote. As I am with the cashier, I see the gentleman who took my order (has glasses and a California state tattoo on his neck) pointing at me, clearly being unprofessional to top off my 40 minutes wasted in line. This was my second time coming here and will not be returning. Poor customer service and terrible organization. Will not be recommending this place to anyone.",

I'm legally blind, and going in here was a cruel tease. I wanted to eat here so badly, but the logistics were unclear and not disability friendly whatsoever. I was so clearly in need of help that a patron, not an employee, offered to help me. I was so frustrated at that point I just had to get out of there before I made a scene. (Sorry, friendly stranger.) Let's be clear, even without a disability, the process for getting tacos here is absurd. There are three lines, and depending on the taco you want, you stand in that line. So if I want one from each line, I'm standing in three separate lines to complete my order, not counting the register. I hate that it was so obvious how lost I was, that a customer, a Good Samaritan, had to show pity on me and offer assistance. I'll never be back, you guys really disappointed me today.",

The night I came in the young guy with the hairnet was working the food station next to the taco ordering area. He kept saying that the people who came in this late should really look at the restaurants hours, and that we just added a whole bunch more work to his night. He said these things more than once and to more than just me. This is never okay and no customer should have to feel the way I did while ordering. Ideally I would not come in this late but working closing shift happens. Just wanted to leave this here so you guys know. Thanks!",

From the exterior, this place looked like an upscale sit-down restaurant, so we were surprised to walk in and see the order-at-the-counter layout. The lines are definitely difficult to understand, but luckily one of the workers there explained it to us. There is no explanation of taco menu items, so that was also difficult to order.  We had gone around 6:30pm and the place was pretty crowded. It was very noisy, and there was a loud mariachi band playing as well, which wasn't very conducive to dinnertime conversation. The tacos were just alright-- it was pretty sloppy and the flavors weren't anything to rave about. Guacamole was good.  I would try it again, now knowing the vibe and ordering system, but I would go during a less busy time.",

The tostada is not even close to what a tostada should be.  They don't have refried beans, really?  What happened to the authenticity?   The burrito is a good size but the chicken was dry and they guy forgot about it once he put in on the oven press.  He gave me the nachos and walked away.  I stood there & when he came back he looked at me and asked me what else I needed?  I looked at him, I pointed to the oven press and said my burrito?  Needless to say it came out burnt.    The dining room had a lot of empty tables all dirty and the entire place just felt less then impressive.  I ordered a house margarita with salt, not only was it in a very small glass which I have never seen here before, there was no salt on the rim and to charge $9 for that is way more then it was worth.  This is not the first bad experience I have had here but I can say it will probably be my last as this is an experience we did not enjoy.",

    "text": "My current food obsession! I probably come here at least 5 times a week at this point for their carne asada tacos and I usually drench each taco with one sauce cup of their hottest sauce.  The only reason I wouldn't give them a 5 star review is their staff. All the cooks are extremely nice however one and/or some of their cashiers are a bit grouchy. An older, shorter hispanic lady rang me up and didn't even acknowledge me. No eye contact, didn't even verbally give me my total, absolutely nothing but grabbing payment. I tried to ask for sauce lids since it was a to-go order and she immediately walked away. So much animosity as if I ran over her dog when I've never even seen her before. The younger cashiers and the really tall one are great tho! BUT cashiers are always the last impression before a customer leaves.  Anyways, this place gets four stars for their amazing food! :D",

I had a chicken, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos.  Each one I ate I said...I like this one best.  Their habanero hot salsa was HOT (thank you...finally I find a good hot sauce that doesn't come out of a jar).  And their tomatillo salsa was mild but not bland.  Service was great, prices great, ambiance cool (I think I might hang out there late night on weekends when I have nothing else to do.)   And yes the ordering is a little weird but I've found a lot of places that become legendary usually have some quirks.  Get over it...learn your first time like I did by asking questions and owning that feeling of being an idiot. And then enjoy the BEST tacos I've had in Vegas bar none.",

    "text": "There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is the BEST location to get your street taco fix and more! This place is over achieving in every aspect. The inside is so nicely decorated you wouldn't find any other casual Mexican eatery like it! They have open seating everywhere, even a second floor or outside on a patio.  As for their food, I've only so far tried their tacos and carne asada fries which were both fantastic. They have so many options atleast 8 and more that it can be overwhelming when ordering. Ofcourse, Al Pastor is a must SO DELICIOUS. Another favorite I recommend is their CHICHARON TACO! Along with the pork meat they include pork rind chips as a topping! They are so generous with their servings you're guaranteed a messy overstuffed flavored filled taco. They also have a self serve sauce bar annnnnd HAPPY HOUR! Which is 5-7pm and again 11-2am for their food and drinks! I can't rave enough about this place, its not overpriced at all, you get what you pay for and more in my opinion! Recommended for EVERYONE",

EXTREMELY disappointed with the customer service here. The lady who rung us up was also working the \"bar\" (the bar has only 5 chairs). She right of the bat had an attitude rolling her eyes and sighing because she had to ring us up. Then this place had NO LIMES what taco place has no freaken limes!! We asked her if she had any limes and she said no and we asked her why and she's rolled her eyes again and rudely said i don't know. What made matters worse is I saw people with beers in the facility that had limes in it. We don't need 100 limes but someone with good customer service would offered 2 or 3 from the bar. Then my boyfriend signed the bill she immediately picked up the receipt looked at it and rolled her eyes again because we didn't tip. Just awful don't waste your time here go to the other location or better yet go to Tacos el Gordo!!! The only reason I gave them even 1 star was the portion size, the guys give you a heaping amount of meat on your tacos!",

    "text": "So we went to this location for a celebration, we rented the upstairs area, and it was for a private event. The venue itself is a decent size, and we were having issues from the very beginning. Note- it was so hectic, i couldn't get any pictures! From the time my sisters got there, they had another event, so the original time of being able to decorate the food, was pushed back an hour. They claimed to have called my sister and let her Know in a voicemail. They never did. So we had to tell our guests to meet st 8, instead of 7. We got text to come at 7:30, complimentary chips and salsa for the inconvenience.... the catering package INCLUDES salsa, they only threw chips in. Then when we arrive, no one was available to help with the dinner. The steam tables were too hot, so we had issues opening the aluminum tops off the table, since no tongs or oven mits were provided. I went downstairs, and the restaurant itself was PACKED, so the food MUST BE GOOD! And I asked the cashiers, (1 on register, 1 with - tablet) if there was anyone available to assist us upstairs, and they said no....... so I was like, \"ok? So can you give me some serving utensils for the salsas for the food? My guests are using plastic spoons to serve themselves the salsas, the sauces, and grabbing the tortilla chips with their hands.\" (I am a catering manager. This is MY job, I know what to expect.) the cashier was so rude; she had NO clue what I wanted, she said they had nothing, what type of restaurant replies with there are NO serving utensils for salsas? And she brought me bulk cutlery SOUP SPOONS! So- naturally I'm aggravated and ask her, \"wait, you don't have backup utensils like what u have at this salsa bar?\" And she said, \"NO.\"  ok.... so she walks me with upstairs to complain to the actual person who was supposed to be helping us, but was on the tablet ringing people up to tell her this wasn't even her job, to tell me AGAIN, use the plastic spoons... (just imagine; per health code, if a foreign object were to fall in ur salsa; sauce, any food for that matter, it's considered contaminated)..... my baby sister who is 17, and a sweet person, tries to relieve me by asking her and the stupid cashier lady gives my baby sister an attitude- so bad she made her cry! So the lady comes around back all pissed off and showing it, with serving spoons, TO NOT EVEN LEAVE THE DAMN Spoons! She just came to huff and puff around us! We didn't get refills like they said, we ran out of tortillas, and the food wasn't even that good! The manager spoke to my sister, apologized, and gave her a discount. The experience you offer someone throwing a party should be decent, and your guests shouldn't have to worry about the tiny things! This place sucked! I wouldn't recommend my friends to rent this place out! I could have done a better job doing some food in my backyard! It's True what they say, 1 bad apple will ruin them all, that cashier they had was terrible! She ruined our night!!!",

We did end up ordering Al Pastor and Asada tacos with an Asada Burrito and chorizo nachos. It was my last day in Vegas and the boyfriend wanted to make sure I was incredibly full for the mere 1 hour plane ride home. Ha. Their side bar was fully stocked with beans, sauces, and veggies. There was definitely something for everyone. I admit, we demolished the food and was left with a quarter of the burrito. As we walked...more like waddled to the car, we were hit with the painful reminder to not stuff our faces till we puke. Otherwise, it was some pretty good food and such a spacious restaurant. I was to see the Banda was about to play as we were leaving. Oh well, next time!",

I asked the lady what do you recommend the shredded beef or the carne asada..she said shredded beef..ok I'll have that with the lime cilantro rice. Wait a few minutes here comes my burrito which btw was just sitting there. They have no way of calling a number or a name I was asked for neither anyways got a few things from the salsa bar which looked pretty nasty. Anyways I bite into the burrito and the rice is so stale I thought I broke a tooth on it..so I go back and ask them to remake it which they do..this time with Spanish rice..again they give me carne asada when I asked for shredded beef..anyways I take like 3 or 4 bites and every piece of meat is disgusting gristle infested with arteries it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten..so I'm spitting out bite after bite finally I was like this is bs...i go back to the counter and tell the girl  I want my money back then she makes me wait while she tries to get her owner on the phone..There is NO MANAGER on duty to resolve a simple case of them serving over priced garbage..she saw me throw away 3/4 of the other burrito and then she says call this number  to speak to the owner..then she says try and reach her on Instagram? Wtf? You try her on instagram...ridiculous! Serving me over priced and poor quality food and I don't get a refund? This is a very simple case and should have been handled right there..i told her forget it and told her I would not return. To me they did nothing but steal from me...very poor customer service..next time I wanna eat like this ill skip the restaurant and head straight to the dumpster....shame on you !",

I have high expectation for this place since reading so many good reviews but disappointed in every way.

The guy took the already cook beef out of the contianer and just chop it up.. I don't like that, I want my meat to be hot the it suppose to be.

I haven't had a bad experienced yet.   Food is always amazing. I could live off their elote. The carne Asada is delicious and thinly cut. The al pastor was a switch up for me and it was literally amazing. I don't normally like spicy food but I will suck it up for anything they have there. My husband and I fight over the carne Asada fries or nachos.   I love the decor. The white brick the tin ceiling, it's all amazing. I love that they have upstairs seating, especially now having a baby it makes dining easier I can just go up there and not worry the baby will ruin others dining experience if she cries.   It's usually a go to even when everyone's drunk and a much more satisfying option than Roberto's.",

For someone that's never been there it's totally confusing. The trays are at the end of the line at the register and the start of the line is labeled as station 4 instead of 1. Then the signage isn't good enough for the new customer to figure out how the whole thing works. Once you know how it works it's easy. There's not really a line, it's more a free for all to get your food and then get to the register and wait.  Like most other people said, the register area is totally inefficient and slow.  Super grossed out by the salsa bar. The ladle is WAY too big for the mini cups they provide, so you end up pouring it all over your fingers and then it drips back into the salsa.

    "text": "Walking into this place I was definitely skeptical whether the tacos would taste like authentic Mexican tacos. As a Mexican, living here in henderson I'd always have to drive all the way across town just to get some decent tacos. So one day me and my girlfriend heard there silly commercial on the radio, which I think the guy talking is hilarious! We end up going, first impression of the place was definitlely interesting, there was a Dj playing, tons of young hip people eating, and I liked it. Then came the real test, I ordered 2 tacos al pastor, and 2 of carnitas. All I have to say was that I was amazed, I have finally found some real authentic tacos that within 3 miles of my home. Highly recommend this taco place to anybody who loves and knows what real tacos should taste like.",

Salsa bar was clean and abundant, however the salsas were not labeled.  I'm used to spicy condiments (the hotter the better) and like surprises, but some of my friends cannot handle spicy salsa.  I would return for the tacos.",

After waiting nearly fifteen minutes for my food I stood patiently waiting to pay. A woman was standing at the register with her back to me, at one point she glanced at me so I assumed she was helping the people in front of me. Another employee seemed to be helping them more than her, so I kept waiting. After a few more minutes she turned around and said hey. I replied with a very irritated sounding hey, she rang me up with the attitude of me inconveniencing her. At this point I felt as though no one deserved a tip because of the wait, and her rudeness. So when I signed their copy of the receipt I drew a line through the tip area. When I handed it back to her she showed it to another employee, to which he replied \"pendejo\". Now I don't speak Spanish, but I know enough to know what that meant  when I looked at her she had a snotty smile on her face, so I took my food and walked away. I refuse to eat here again simply because of her attitude and the unnecessary insult. Expect great food, but don't expect service with a smile. You might even get an insult with your meal too.",

    "text": "My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back.",

Was at first worried about how fancy the place looked...I prefer my tacos from a more grimy or dingy looking spot...gives it flavor I feel. Ordered the breakfast burrito, ended up with what appeared to be a massive meal that could have easily been shared and kept me full all day, and less than $7! Fresh meat right off the grill, made to order. They'll serve you up some samples if simply ask. They have it all...a wide variety of meats (everything from nose to tail it seems like) and veggies. The salsa bar is easily the most impressive I've ever seen...fresh made salsas, fresh cut veggies, grilled veggies still steaming, and boiling beans. The homemade horchata was unbelievable. Service was a little slow, which is fine considering that they basically build your meal from scratch. Looking forward to going back for more!",

My friends usually go to the Taco y Taco that is close to UNLV, but I thought that location was quite ghetto due to its location and interior. The Taco y Taco at UNLV is not as clean as the one on Eastern. I really enjoy this Taco y Taco because of its modern vibe as well as the chance to listen to a live mariachi band play from time to time.  Taco y Taco has the best al pastor tacos that you can find in Vegas! Their al pastor tacos are very flavorful, and the toppings are definitely on point. Something I also really enjoy are their elotes! Their elotes are the best elotes I have ever eaten because they are not overpowered with tajin, and they have the perfect flavor.  Something that you should be prepared for is the wait. Since this place is very popular within this neighborhood as well as across the valley, there will be long lines even on days where the live mariachi band is not playing and on days when it is not taco Tuesdays. However, the wait is definitely worth it since the food is really good!",

I knew what I wanted and waited in the \"burrito/nacho/fries\" line right off the bat.  My friends wanted tacos and waited in that line.  It was so busy that I could see how this would be a problem for others who are not used to ordering from the counter this way.  This is what my friends & I ordered: - Al pastor fries - Carne asada nachos - Al pastor tacos - Carne asada tacos - Beef burrito - Chicharron taco - Corn on the cob (mexican street style)  Everything was a hit and tasted delicious and flavorful.  The only \"miss\" was the chicharron taco.  My friend thought it might be the crispy pork skin version, but ended up to be chewy.  Yuck! We weren't very adventurous, but they do offer a variety of meat options and body parts.  Besides meat, there is of course vegetarian options.  The salad/sauce bar was good, but none of the sauces were labeled.  The new location is very spacious and looks like an upscale taco joint.  The food though, stays True to authenticity. There are also extra seating upstairs.Happy hour daily during 6-8pm ($1 off beer).  Overall, great food & location.  For about $10 you can get a satisfying meal.

I only got tacos al pastor but oh how I wanted to get the corn. I was too full by then to get corn.

The opposite of all the hole in the wall Mexican places I was brought up on in San Diego. But another Yelper said it was the best tacos in Vegas. So I had to give it a shot.  The guy that helped me was super friendly, letting me sample three of their meats even after I had already ordered the 2 he recommended. Great customer service.  The tacos weren't very big and were $2.25 each, so they're about double what I want them to be priced at. I almost gave them 4 stars due to the price, but they were so friendly I have to give them 5.  Oh, and there was a DJ spinning in the restaurant when I was there. Only in Vegas, amIright?",

    "text": "So, I was raised in east Las Vegas, and the original, quaint Tropicana location is different in style and space, but both locations serve the same, authentic tacoria-style menu items...So get your feet wet on South Eastern before heading to the big leagues down ELV.  Two ways to go when ordering: either plan your attack...choose in advance from the menus while you wait in line, otherwise fire-from-the-hip, waiting until you front the line then order en espanol. You'll see a generous mixture of gringos y nationales in line....20-something hipsters filled this location pin the Saturday night we ate there.  Choices a relatively simple: choose your meat (pork, carne, etc.) choose the style (taco, tostada, etc.) then be prepared for the fixings (cilantro, onion, salsa, guac....)  I can whole-heartedly recommend the pollo, carnitas, and barbacoa...everything is soft and luscious like a night out, south of the border. Here's a tip - I suggest eating in courses of one set of tacos at a time, together with one or more rounds of their draft beers! Braving the ordering line isn't such a big deal once you get the hang of it.  If you have a big appetite, our simply want a handful of food, try the custom burrito bar, which works like other popular QSR burrito joints.  All in all, Taco Y Taco is an extremely authentic gem along the S Eastern foodie corridor, and is also available in a less-hipster wrapper along E Tropicana , you choose!",

Now, when we were there, it wasn't too crazy so ordering was easy, but I could see how if there were a lot of people it would get confusing and nuts. Luckily, we didn't experience that.  We took advantage of the happy hour menu and had the three carnitas tacos and the chicken nachos, both of which were only $5 each! What a great value.  Not only was the food fantastic and yummy, they also have a salsa bar with all kinds of goodies, like black and pinto beans and the really good creamy green sauce. Everything on the salsa bar is included if you buy food so you could literally eat your weight in beans if you wanted. I weigh a little too much for that, but either way, it's worth mentioning.  I added a soda and Jen had water...bringing our grand total to $13.50 for a really good and filling dinner for two!  Note that the Chicken Nachos came with all the good stuff, like Guac and Sour Cream and Pico! SOOOO GOOOOOOD!! Also, the carnitas taco have a little kick to them, but overall the flavor was pretty dang good!!  I will certainly be back.",

    "text": "YUM!!!  This place has been on my list of bookmarks forever. I wasn't able to \"dine in\" during this visit, so this review is strictly for take-out.  First of all, I really dislike places with small/tight parking lots.  And this is one is super small. It's always packed in the lot and I feel like there are accidents just waiting to happen...  I was here on a weekday, around 1pm. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in, but was pleasantly surprised.  The decor is cute and I like the vibe, it's like someone took a taco shop and covered it in glitter (just kidding, there is no glitter)!  The ordering process is a little bit confusing if you aren't familiar, but the staff was super friendly and when I tried to order at the wrong window, the gentleman sent me to the right place.  I ordered an Al Pastor burrito for a coworker.  I thought $8.25 was a bit pricey, but she said that it was REALLY good, so I suppose it was worth it.  Everything is made to order - when building my burrito, the young lady asked if I preferred black beans or pintos, white rice or Spanish rice, etc.  It's like a truly authentic version of Chipotle, and with much better food.  For myself I ordered the chips and guacamole.  What a steal for $3.25 - they gave you a big thing of chips and I may have to say that this was he best guacamole I've ever had.  It was seriously so delicious! I shared with some coworkers who immediately wanted more.  The chips were also homemade (as they should be), and really awesome.  The cashier was very friendly and when I mentioned that the order was to-go, she gave me lids so I could take salsa with me.  The salsa bar had a great selection, with some hot sauces I had never even heard of!  I look forward to returning soon, so I can sit down and enjoy a meal in the restaurant.  They also have a bar, which is awesome!  I love a good taco shop, and this is no exception. Do yourself a favor and stop by if you are in the area!",

Then you walk in to what reminds me of a college cafeteria- salsa bar, soda fountain, and random loud music blaring. And I mean RANDOM- from Ginuwine's Pony, to Coldplay, to Tejano.  The lines to order were a bit confusing for a first timer even with the signs. It was hard to hear the servers with the enormously deep counters. And the counters were so tall that I had to stand on my tippy toes and yell and point at the food that I wanted to order.  The bar is so tiny and it holds like 4 stools. Not a place to sit and unwind with your friends. The total for my 2 gran tacos and a water was $12. Now that is not a good deal in my opinion.  It was just too much for too little. Not my ideal spot for a meal.",

It's a little hard to communicate with the workers there since they don't really speak English well and whenever you want to ask them a question they only say no or yes when I specifically asked what kind of cheese they have, twice.   But don't get me wrong, the food is better than the average so just try it. I ordered a burrito with guac and extra meat and it came out to 15-17 dollars. I, myself, didn't think it was worth it since it was a rather small burrito, smaller than a 6 dollar burrito you can get at robertos.",

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews on yelp. I made it a mission to come here with my toddler and a mission it was. This place is pretty big on seatings (lots of tables and chairs), I believe there might have been an upstairs as well,  but i am not sure ( didnt have time to explore) I did see someone coming downstair with their child, so I am not sure if it was an employee. This place is pretty loud and i am not sure what mind of music was playing (not a good place to have conversations). But it had a pretty fast beat to it.  At times I felt like I wanted to throw my taco on the floor and just dance (should be called Club Taco y Taco). But at $2.25 each, I decided it be best to just devour it instead. Now upond arrival, I was a bit confused. I didnt inderstand the concept of ordering, they have three different lines set up at the taco side, you pretty much wait in each line, depending on your choice of meat to order your taco. So yeah, that was a bummer we had to wait in two lines and wait an again at the bar to order our nachos. So if this place is packed, you will be waiting for a good amount of time. Now on to the meats, I ordered carne asada and carnitas. I basically was not impressed, I ve had better street tacos at hole in the wall places. But at least the tomatillo salsa was able to redeemed it in the  flavor catergory.  Overall the only thing I was impressed with was the homemade tortillas, (the kind abuela made with masa) i could literally eat these tortillas all day.  So if you dont mind waiting then this place might be for you, if your okay with bland meat then this is your place. I might have to give this place another chance.  just to try out there fish tacos and take some homade tortillas home.",

I understand that it may be hard to hear behind the counter, but I had to constantly ask the employee what kind of meat it was.

She was rude and she made the rest of our order carelessly, not to mention, she picked the meat for us just because she was too irritated to talk to us anymore. Then later when we went to go pay, she went ahead & talked about us in a very rude way, in spanish, & I know this because I do, in fact, understand spanish, but she seemed like she didn't know that. This employee was named Bessy (I believe that's the name I saw on the name tag). She was honestly just so rude & I'm not sure if we all want to come back here if this is how the employees are going to treat the customers. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ATTITUDE.",

You can get the nachos for only $5 during the daily happy hour as well as some other very good deals.  The salsa bar has a lot of options.  The only drawback is ordering the tacos can get very hectic and disorganized when they are busy.  The wait can get lengthy as well.  Their ordering system involves walking up to the counter and ordering directly from the preparer.  It can be fun and adds to the atmosphere, but if there are just a couple people in front of you, the wait can become quite long.  If they can ever figure out how to move their line faster, I wold rate them five stars.",

    "text": "Will definitely go back ^_^ The only reason its a 3 star instead of 4 star is how unorganized the restaurant was.  FOOD: Al Pastor Taco (Station #4) - Delicious!  good pork favor and the toppings made it just right  Al Pastor Vampiro (Station #2) - Really good however i didnt even know what a Vampiro was.. there was no signs to describe it and no one could tell me what it was.  Vampiro is pretty much of a sandwich made of 2 hard corn tortilla, cheese, meat selection, onions, and salsa.     Lengua Taco (Station #3) - meh, it was okay.  The tongue lacked favored and need to have that seared crispy to make it really good.   SERVICE:  The layout of the open kitchen, signs, and where the food trays are is kind of deceptive.  When you walk in it seems similar to Chipotle/Subway, where you start at one end and make your way down to the cashier.   There are actually 5 lines (Nachos/Burrito line, Station #2 Line, Station #3 Line, Station #4 Line, and the Cashier ).  However the food trays are located only next to Station 4 which makes everyone form a huge line.  You stand in line for whichever type of food you want and than you go to the cashier to pay.    The staff is polite and some are friendly the only problem is that no one explains what anything is... like a Vampiro vs. Mula vs. Tostada.  All the meats are listed and there are some you know off the bat just due to seeing it your whole life... but there are some i've never seen before.  When i ordered the Al Pastor Taco, the guy asked me if i wanted everything on it, I asked what is \"everything\" and he just looked at me.  I ended up just getting it so i dont hold up the line.",

My favorite is the al pastor (grilled pork) so I usually just get all al pastor tacos. It comes with pineapple salsa avocado salsa cilantro and onions. It's not the best tacos I've ever had. The meat could be a little more flavorful but the salsa and crispy ness of the meat makes up for that.  Overall I think it's delicious.   Their corn on the cob is also super good. Comes with mayo Parmesan cheese and pepper. Get it when corn is in season so it's super juicy and not overly dry.   I also love that this place has a salsa bar. They have a variety of salsas and toppings including grilled onions, jalapenos and carrots and radishes.  Henderson is a little out of my way but I can see myself making the trip again for these tacos!",

The lines they had for certain meats were interesting, they didn't have too many people working but the service was great and very friendly.   Honestly honestly, I wanted to really like this place but I didn't really like the meat at all... I had carneasada and chorizo and it just didn't taste like authentic meat. The chorizo was very fluffy and weird like an egg tofu like texture. It looked like soy chorizo or something. And it didn't have much flavor at all. It didn't have that like oil and flavor that chorizo usually has. The Asada didn't even taste like Asada it tasted like shredded roast beef or something. Authentic Mexican Asada is like that thick ranchero meat. That's the good stuff. And if your paying $2.25 a taco they should be using the good genuine stuff. I don't care about the guacamole and stuff they put on it, the meat is what I care about.  They use handmade tortillas but it's not the masa kind but they use the kal (yellow) kind. And it didn't taste bad but it wasn't like they freshly made them. They were pre made hand made tortillas.   My boyfriend had the al pastor tacos and a mula. He enjoyed it, he especially liked the pineapple on it.   They have a really amazing salsa bar, fresh limes and carrots and grilled onions there as well. It is a very clean and put together restaurant. Very beautiful layout and atmosphere. Great place to hang out, just wasn't a fan of their food :/",

I took my mom and she said it was one of the best she had since Cali. They even sale Elote...Yes Elote. Plus they have a great salsa bar with beans. Who else does that? Nobody that I've seen.

You walk in and there's no flow as to where to go or how to order nor any friendly faces helping lost first time diners. The staff seemed tense and stressed out. (I wonder if the flow is better back there). Only go here if you like to be yelled at and shoved through the line by the angry dishwasher lady who didn't wash her hands before putting her gloves on. Are ripped seats that cut your behind the new trend in restaurants this year? No, only at this sad place.",

I stopped by this location to try their pastor tacos and their carne asada fries. This place is located in a very busy plaza next to smash burger and many other restaurants. Its very clean inside, if you are trying to eat in. I prefer to do a take out and so I did. The carne asada fries with their mole sauce and guacamole was delicious, but the tacos were on another level. The flavor was perfect and small sweetness from the pineapple made it more enjoyable. They also have very unique condiments, and I would highly recommend trying out the creamy cilantro sauce on you tacos.   Overall (4/5) - great",

    "text": "We've been here a couple of times and have had a decent experience. My first thoughts is the ordering system is a bit wonky, hence the 3 stars. There's four different lines and it can get a bit convoluted. I stood in line 3 for some carne asada street tacos for quite a while before I was finally acknowledged. There were two guys manning all three lines which were long due to it being \"Taco Tuesday\". Once I got my tacos I went to the fourth line for some elote (which I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu). I was happy that I no longer have to go to north town to find the old lady pushing the grocery basket - that was a win! I also got the cilantro white rice as a side which was bland & not tasty. I ended up throwing it away. My husband had gone straight to the fourth line to get a burrito bowl with al pastor (which was awesome and hand carved which gave it a nice touch). The guy serving the fourth line was personable and cracking jokes - which helped break up the stress from the ordering process.   Check out was easy and they have a huge self-service salsa bar which was well-maintained. Prices are decent...$2.25 per taco and $3 for the elote. They do have a taco happy hour as well. There's a soda machine and a full service bar. Seating is available both upstairs and downstairs and they have a patio for when the weather is nice.   Overall good tacos, great tasting meat, frustrating ordering process. We'll be back though to give it another go.",

Hands down the best al pastor and tripas that I've tried here in Vegas, especially the Al pastor. Tripas have always been my favorite but now I think it's met it's match.  Love the fresh salsa bar.  The mole fries were unique but not a big fan of them. They have a beer bar which I think is amazing. All the meat is cooked and cut right in front of you. All fresh ingredients are used as well as the meat and that's another thing besides the flavor of the food that sets Taco y Taco apart from every other Taco shop. Can't get enough of this place! Now maybe we can get one on the Westside huh?",

Excellent salsa bar with both black and pinto beans for you to serve yourself which makes it reasonably priced to me. No meat added to the beans is a big plus.

    "text": "First of all, they were really close to getting a  fourth star from me but I just couldn't do it. The tacos were delicious, but I'm an atmosphere and experience person and those just did not deliver for me.   Food: I got the Gran Tacos with no meat. Vegetarian options here are great (soyrizo, sauteed mushrooms), but I wasn't feeling super adventurous at the time. The salsa was my favorite. Not too spicy, but super flavorful. I also had black beans, cheese, and guacamole on mine, and they really were excellent. They melt the cheese right on the tortilla, and then you can get more on top. My friend got the Mexican street style corn on the cob, which was amazing. Definitely will go back for that alone.  Atmosphere: I feel like the layout is all wrong, almost backwards or something. They explain to you the different lines that are available for different items that you order, but the area isn't big enough and the lines sort of all run together, and I witnessed multiple people think they were being cut in line, and wonder what the hell was going on. Not to mention the burrito/bowl/fries line runs the other way, right into the street taco line.. Not laid out very well at all. The topping bar is also kind of in the way of these lines. Not sure how that will work during a big lunch rush...  If customers can get past the clusterfuck of a layout, taco y taco will be successful. But if customers get frustrated/confused like we were today, they could easily walk out and go to any other restaurant in the plaza. I know it's a brand new place so maybe they are still just working out the kinks! (I hope!)",

They honestly didn't have that much flavor and the portion sized when it came to the burrito were quite stingy. Even Chipotle isn't that stingy, but I don't eat there often anyway. I tried my bf's al pastor tacos which were very good. He had a long island which had no alcohol and was charged $9 (never again).

Tacos y tacos is located near Eastern and 215 in the same center as Cafe Zuppas, Smash Burger, and Twin Peaks.  Restaurant is roomy and clean. We went on a Friday night and they had a DJ which was pretty neat.  It was very crowded tonight and when we went up to order, it was so disorganized. This was a our first time coming here so we had no clue on how their ordering system went. We can see the different stations but we weren't sure as to who we place our order with etc etc.  We ordered the asada burrito, asada taco grande, asada nachos, and Elote (Mexican style corn).  Large portions for fairly cheap prices. Meat was a bit on the dry side. Definitely not healthy food so stay away if you're on a diet.

Nice that is comes with guacamole without an additional charge. Also had the chicken nachos. Only thing I didn't care about that is they just sprinkle shredded cheese & warm it up. Thought they could have done better with the cheese but when everything else was added on the nachos it was quite flavorful. I like the carne asada & chicken. Horchata taste like cupcakes to me lol.",

Great staff, prices are a bit steep, but it's location in a trendy Henderson strip mall with lots of eating options almost forces their prices to be higher. Good bar selection, lots of seating. Can get crowded during lunch and dinner hours and the individual lines for different menu items doesn't help the matter. Tacos el Gordo is my preference, but this place holds up fairly well.",

As such, the line was long and when I didn't get something I paid for and tried to go up front to get it they wanted to take a freaking inventory of my meal to ensure I wasn't scamming them for chips.    Additionally the pricing just wasn't there for me for a walk-up place like this. I was hoping for a better experience.",

    "text": "My first trip to Taco y Taco was 2 days ago at the Pecos location. I decided to try out their new location today. So you know it's good.  Had an al pastor and shrimp burrito because I wanted to get crazy. The meat is so tender and juicy, the burrito fillings all hit the right spots and they melt the cheese on the tortilla before making the burrito. It's great.   If you don't know any better you'd be confused by the ordering system, as there are different stations for different items. I'm sure they'll figure out a better way to do this, but there's not just not one big line, there's a crowd of ravenous humans grouped up trying to figure out which meat or taco station they're supposed to be at so they can fill their fat faces.   The salsa bar, which houses 7 or 8 different sauces/salsas, is great. I'm a sauce kind of guy. I like to try many different salsas on my meal, so thank you for saucing me up. The salsa bar also houses cucumbers, pickled carrot/jalapenos, but my favorite part is the fact they have their grilled onions and jalapenos refilled here instead of ordering behind the counter.  Last but not least I also had elote which is the mexican street style corn on the cob, mayo, cotija cheese and chili pepper. I don't think I would come here and not order that. Although the other location when I went had the white corn(which I prefer), this location had yellow corn, but good nonetheless.  This location also has a bar.  Aesthetically, this location could use some work, as I'm not sure what they're going for. By no means does it look bad, just needs work and nothing that can't easily be fixed. Ultimately, I don't go to places because they look cool, it's all about the food and Taco y Taco delivers.   May take a nap.",

Was in the mood for a burrito so we ordered ONE arne asada burrito and we're given many options for what we wanted to add - 2 types of rice, 2 types of beans, grilled veggies, 2 types of cheese,  several salsas, plain mashed avocado or guacamole, and more! The burrito is REALLY BIG!! Plenty for two people especially since there are many sides and appetizers to go with.

They offer a wide variety of proteins (5 different types of beef including tripe, tongue, \"cabeza\", BBQ & Carne asada; al pastor prepped pork as well as chorizo, carnitas, buche, and chicharon; chicken and beef; grilled fish and shrimp; they also offer multiple vegetarian options.  In addition to the aforementioned tacos and burritos they offer bowls and \"granny tacos\". They have a nice salsa bar with 6 different salsas, grilled and pickled vegetables. At 2 in the afternoon the place was \"lunchtime\" busy, on the noisy side with recorded music overhead and an upstairs dining room. Finally,  for drinks they offer fountain sodas, Mexican bottled sodas and have a FULL bar. We will certainly be back.",

They don't have what kind of meat it is in English on the menu and the employees were busy so I ended up looking up each word on my phone.   The food is tasty and meat is moist.   Lack of organization, dirty tables and trash was wanting to come out of the trash container. Bartenders were pretty slow. Good margaritas, but the two bartenders I went to at separate times made different types of margaritas.  I didn't question/complain to them about it, it was just a margarita.",

I just happened to find this place by browsing Yelp and it lives up to it's rating.  A friend of mine who was also with me on this trip said this place reminded her of great taco places she visited in Mexico while visiting family.  We ordered all kinds of tacos from carne asada, pollo asado, lengua, chicharron, buche, and tripa.  They were all delicious and we ended going twice in our 4-night stay in Vegas.  The salsa bar had 6 different salsas but the habanero salsa wasn't that hot which was a bummer.  Nevertheless, this place is great and I'll be back the next time I'm in town.",

Definitely not fast food taco prices. We had 2 bowls and 2 fountain drinks and it came to just under $30  I had a chicken bowl. The chicken was good but overall the food lacked flavor. You definitely have to add some from the salsa bar which had tons of options to choose from.   It was very clean and the staff was friendly. They have a ton of seating downstairs and upstairs. I went early in the day during the week so it wasn't very busy.   I noticed you could order adult beverages at their bar which would be awesome if I was going for dinner.",

A very confusing process when ordering food.  Everyone was guessing where to begin.  Finally got our food and then proceeded to the salsa bar.  Now with the lunch time crowd piling in, getting to the salsa bar was impossible.  I would reccomend relocating it far from the confussing food ordering lines.  It became a mixed jumble of confusion and frustration for everyone.  I ordered 3 tacos and she ordered a salad, along with a couple of beers.  Very tasty, and the salsas were great.  Had to practically shout to converse, because of the music being pumped over the sound system.  They do not skimp on the guac, compared to Cafe Rio, where you get a tiny teaspoon scoop of guac.  Finished with the meal and a cold Stella, while watching and laughing in amazement at the other customers trying to figure out the maze of lines.  Would eat here again, but would advise to avoid the lunch time rush.  Place was clean and friendly service.  Food was authentic and tasty, but giving it 3 stars for the mass of confusion while ordering, and the overpowering thump of loud music.  This in turn.... caused every person in the joint to yell, just to converse..",

They make great food, or at least they used to, but their stupid, loud DJ is killing their business.  Because of the loud music, we despise eating there, no matter how great the food is.  Too bad. Otherwise the Mrs. and I would probably eat there every week -- Or we would if the food is still as good as it was the last time we went, which was was last spring.  As it is, we just won't go there anymore  We went a couple times last spring, but we won't be back.  Ambience is kind of like a Wendy's, but with really loud music.  Really bad management decision.  They had good food and could have been a success, but ruined their business with that loud DJ.  Must be an investor's nephew or something.  UPDATE MAY 2015:   I went again last week.  The food was as good as ever.  The al pastor tacos are amazing.  The atmosphere is still awful.  But the food is amazing.  Changing review to four stars.  Four stars is generous considering how awful the atmosphere is, but the food, the food . . . it's so GOOD!  UPDATE MARCH 2016  DJ was there last week, but he was much quieter, which was nice.  You could have a conversation in the restaurant now.  Food is still stupendous, and now they have stupendous microbrews on tap -- Try the Red's Rye PA or the Toaster Pastry.  The Al Pastor tacos and the mexican street corn are da' bomb.  Loving this place.  If they could just get the ambience less cafeteria-like -- Maybe have a bigger bar, for starters..  Oh, but the food and the beer is so, so GOOD!",

He even commented to \"not come back\" and he's not \"tripping \" started to laugh with his other ghetto looking bald Mexican looking coworker while he laughed along too. As a professional business man specializing in Medical Equipment and IT Services in hospital environments this is unprofessional. Will let all my friends and family in Vegas and Los Angeles county know not to bother. You get better service for street tacos instead.",

    "text": "Came here for a quick lunch alone prior to an appointment near by in green valley. This isn't the first time I had ate at taco y taco as the previous time we had someone run to the restaurant to pick up order and bring back to the hospital in Henderson so it wasn't exactly at its \"freshest\".   This time I had came during lunch time on a Tuesday. To my surprise there was NO lines, and the guy was waiting for me before I even walked half-way through the restaurant. I'm a fan of eating lengua (beef tongue), buche (pig stomach) with possibly a choice between al pastor or carne asada. After I quickly received my tacos with everything, decided to try out their Elote (Mexican style street corn) as many have raved on how good it was.   After paying and getting some sauces (medium and hot - habanero and green tomatillo) with some sliced radishes and limes, sat down and ate.   None of the sauces were spicy, to my surprise. Even the so called habanero one wasn't all that spicy. The meats were flavored pretty well tho a little over tender for the buche and lengua.   The elote was overly soft. I expected fresher cooked corn? Kind of reminds me of those ud get at fast food joints or buffets where its overly soft. Would have preferred more cheese and spice. Maybe I should try making this at home... HEHEHE",

No cheese. Had to come home, add cheese and heat them up.  Ordered multiple burritos and also tacos.  Asked for lids for salsa and she asked how many tacos we ordered. They only would give us 5 lids. These are not the normal size salsa containers, they are the small ones that hold approximately 1 tablespoon of salsa.  Very disappointed in the customer service. Referrals are the number one thing that bring in new customers. Horrible service is never acceptable in business.  I don't write bad reviews unless the service or the food was well below acceptable and the service in his establishment was.",

    "text": "I'll start with, the food is pretty good. Just like the other location, except this is more of a cafeteria style and a bit less divey.   I am not a fan of the setup for multiple reasons. 1. It's confusing. I have no idea where I am ordering, if I am paying first then going to the counter to pick my toppings. I don't know which area I am supposed to order what food from. It is all crazy and unorganized. 2. The staff doesn't really care to help you figure out what you are supposed to be doing. I asked where I should order a breakfast burrito from, and the man behind the counter pointed at a area. However when I went to that spot, that woman said I should pay first, then come back. 3. Once I did order, I didn't get to select what I wanted to do inside the breakfast burrito. I had to shout, as she was rolling it up, \"Can I have some avocado?\". It was just a sloppy mess of a system. Speaking of sloppy mess, there were no to-go lids for the salsa bar, so that was a fun experience in the car, each of us juggling our salsas all the way home. Clearly, we were desperate.  Bottom line is, I have no idea what to do here, and if the staff helped you figure out where to order, and what the process was, I think this place would be great. The food is good, sure! But in a city full of wonderful Mexican food it is not worth it to deal with the strife of eating here.",

Their quesadillas with steak are addicting. Anything I've eating here is worth coming back for. That's why this place gets five stars, their food is fabulous!  Soooooo what's the problem....  Their service sucks! I always feel like they serve the spanish speakers with better service and respect than those who speak English. Every single time! If I ask for extra cheese or no avacado or anything to peronalize my dish, all I get are eye rolls and they ignore my requests. If I want my order togo, they suddenly become extremely rude. They are stingy with their sauce caps, they don't want to give me a togo bag.   Overall....  Love the food, hate the service. So if you can ignore the rude attitude and enjoy your food.

I'm so happy this place is like 10 min from my house and is so much better!  They have more food variety - You can make bowls, burritos, street corn.... They have a huge full bar - the horchata rum drink and their house margarita were very tasty!  Their interior is super clean and chic decor.  This is not a little taco shop. Weekend evenings they have a DJ Upfront which we enjoyed while having our delicious drinks and chatting up over some tacos!  Great little spots I will be bringing all my clients for lunch",

I'm not sure I want to be eating salsa flavored with Windex.  The food is ok, not great, but the tacos are way over priced.  The worst part was what appeared to be the owners and their daughters (who are obviously working there) arguing in Spanish five feet from my table. I am a white guy that they were not aware is fluent in Spanish. Based on the conversation and what was being said in front of guests, I will NOT go back to this place. They need to remember that they need people of all races to spend money in there restaurant for it to survive. They will not get my had earned money.",

    "text": "This is a beautiful location in a great central area,however my experiences here have not been positive at all. Today was the 3rd time in a week I have came here for Elotes,not a very hard menu item at all to have available throughout the day. The first time I came at around 7pm and was told they've been out for awhile. This EXCUSE was just that an excuse. To cook whole corn takes. It a few minutes and is an extremely simple task that even the most novice cook can do. The second time was just the next day at around Noon and then I was told that they hadn't prepared the corn yet and it would be awhile before it was ready and that I could go to another of their locations. This was both rude and horrible customer service at the same time. The third time was just a matter of minutes ago. This morning I went in at 10:16 pm. I thought to myself that they possibly may not have it ready since they only opened at 10am,but I obviously was wrong in assuming that this establishment was staffed by proper chefs/cooks/or managers who were skilled and knowledgeable in food prep and having the entire menu ready before the establishment opens. Instead of being told this morning that they were out I was instead told \"The night shift didn't leave us any prepared corn\" so am I correct in assuming that if cooked food weather it be corn in this case or let's say meat of some sort of not used the day before is re-used again the next day?. If so then I really would question the food safety.",

I had just watched what looked like amazing nachos being constructed for the guy in front of me in line so I expected the almost $9 burrito I was about to order would be stuffed with ingredients but instead I watched as thin layers of components were added. Burrito was not even served to me hot enough for the cheese to melt inside; left me wondering why they bother to wrap it in foil then serve it to you on a styrofoam plate. At the soda machine I was interjected by a fellow diner who told me there's better spots to try on the east side of town.",

It gets confusing when there's a long line for line 1, and you want to order from line 3, but you don't want to cut anybody and make them (h)angry.  Particularly this past Friday night June 12th, 2015, it was hot and smelly inside. The AC wasn't on, and it reeked of garbage and wet dog in the area next to the staircase. It was seriously uncomfortable eating inside, and I regret choosing not to just eat at home.  I ate 2 al pastor tacos (which I usually get) and the al pastor was not juicy like I had remembered. It was overcooked and not flavorful. It's just difficult because I used to be obsessed with their al pastor, and that night I was utterly disappointed (I take my food seriously, especially when I come to LOVE it haha).  Maybe I just came at a bad night. I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because I remember how they used to be. I'm sad that I was actually disappointed with my experience that night.",

Unfortunately, the chicken in the chicken taco was so burned that half of the serving was essentially inedible charcoal.  The shrimp tacos were good and flavorful and so was the guacamole.  Some other reviews commented on the loud music, but it was fine when we were there.  Overall it was ok but we aren't excited about returning.",

The Vampiro is one of their specials and is always a good idea. Carnitas and fresh pineapple squished into cheesy fried tortilla goodness.They have tons of vegetarian options including the soyrizo tacos. I always order them with everything on them. Delicious!! I love the Mexican corn which is sweet corn with crema, cotija cheese and chili powder. So good. The salsas are all at a help yourself area and offer a variety of mild, medium and hot choices along with beans, veggies including marinated onions and fresh radish and lime.   I always get the horchata with my meal. By far, the best I have ever had. The sweet cinnamon milky drink helps cool down the spicy flavors of your tacos or burrito. I'm not even embarrassed to admit I usually down three cup fulls.   Try this place out, you'll love it.",

Once we entered there was a DJ playing some house music, which went with the vibe of the place, open and very inviting. There are about 3 stations where you order your food. We got 3 chicken tacos and 3 Carne Asada tacos with everything on it! Yummmmmm is all I can say, everything is freshly prepared and made right in front of you! I tried the tacos vampiros for the first time, and let me tell you this is my favorite now! Crunchy, cheesy, delicious explosion of flavors in su boca! I'm definitely coming here again.",

Yet the new location does have some attributes that are more favorable than the original. One; They have beers on draft. Two; They have liquor. Three: Lines are quick.   My list is going to make it seem like I'm an alcoholic. That is only half True. The real reason why I go to Taco Y Taco is for their food. The al pastor is one of my favorites. They have that charred crisp on the outside that stands up to the slathering of everything. Ask for the grilled pineapple, too. It just makes the meal better. I have tried almost every single taco and I cannot see anything to complain about. The lengua, cabeza, and carnitas are all delicious. If they do not put on everything that you wanted, do not fret, their salsa bar is unreal, too. I'm used to the cold bar being filled with a few varying degrees of spice, radishes, limes, and the pickled veggies. Theirs has a hot section as well. Grilled onions and jalapenos just taste better when they are kept warm for you.  Although I do not mind to drive to the old location. I can rest at ease knowing that this location is a viable solution to my taco needs.",

They have a decent selection of taco styles but I chose to go with the Al Pastor and the Mexican Street Corn on the Cob.  Needless to say, the food was delicious, and I will definitely be back for another round of amazing.  The only confusing thing is walking in the door you kind of get lost as it is first come first serve seating and the lines have no real direction.

Stood in front of a counter at the \"burrito\" counter where I was not welcomed, not asked what I'd like but just looked at by 2 employees who decided to stand there and talk to each other and drink. Not being there before I was wondering if I somehow was in the wrong line. Went back over again and this lady asked what I want. I told her 3 burritos. She wanted me to tell her the ingredients of all burritos before she started.... then rolled her eyes because as I'm trying to shout my order at her (music is loud and you can't hear a thing) I'm not going fast enough. As I moved down the line with ingredients she did the same thing. I wanted to tell her to eat the burritos herself for being such a C but my kids were hungry and ready to eat. I could keep going about how dirty the restaurant was and the ladies at the register texting while with a customer with the most welcoming faces.   Never returning. Huge disappointment with all these deceiving reviews.",

There's different lines for different types of tacos and they're a tad bit on the expensive side about 2.50/taco but I think it's worth it.   These tacos are like the small street tacos or taco truck sizes. Once you order them, you can walk to a different line to get your toppings like cheese or whatever on it. That line is also for other stuff like nachos, fries or burritos and other stuff. They can definitely hook you up on them fries and nachos! Just a tip, if you want cheese, specify which type because they have like 4 kinda. My husband asked for cheese and they gave him the shredded Kraft Mexican style cheese. I say that because I'm used to getting queso fresco or cojita cheese on my tacos so just be aware :).  Once you're done, they also have a fresh salsa bar as well with a variety of sauces, radishes, limes and fresh veggies like cilantro and onions!!! A do it yourself kinda place is the best place!  All in all, we're coming back for sure because this place is delicious AND it's off the strip!",

With that said, who can complain about fresh homemade corn tortillas and endless real Mexican meat choices from chicken to beef to pork to fresh garnishes of fresh lettuce onions cilantro etc.  Was sorry was in a rush as I have to go back to try the roasted corn, quesadillas etc.  My al pastor  tacos were delicious as was the amazing salsa bar with endless choices to dress your taco with.

Tonight I read the name of a beer off of the \"todays drafts\" list and the bartender looked like I asked for his dead puppy. They didn't have that beer. That was listed on the list of today's beers.   I really love the food here. It's seriously a place I bring every visitor. This is my taco happy place.

She can not eat meat and if she does she gets very sick. This place was nice because it had soyrizo so it was a great option. Yesterday I went there to pick up lunch. She is sick so this sounded good so she could get something spicy to help clear her sinuses. When ordering(which I hate because of the lack of proper lines) I ordered hers. I thought they said chorizo so I double, checked that it was soyrizo and not chorizo. I even confirmed making sure it was the vegetarian option. They confirmed it and I placed my order. When I got my order I doubled checked everything was correct and mine said chicken and hers said soyrizo.   I take the food home to her. We start to eat and she notices something that was stringy. She said immediately spits it out and checks but it looks like soyrizo should and I told her I double checked and even saw they get it from another area so it should be good. She takes another bite and spits it out right away again. Right there is a chunk of steak. I open the burrito and look and all through the soyrizo are chucks of meat. I want to be clear this was not a mistake of a wrong protein. This was soyrizo but in whatever way meat got into it. She freaks out and runs to the bathroom to try to get it out of her system. We thought she would be ok but the next few hours she is in pain leading to very being ill and throwing up everything. She was already sick and now she cant hold food down all because they dont care? I do not mean to be graphic and this explains more then it needs to but this is severe. It was bad but could have been much worse. What if it was a life or death allergy?  TL;DR Their vegetarian option had meat in it which made my already sick wife very ill. They do not care about your dietary needs or restrictions.",

Though I do love the small \"taco truck\" feel of the east location, the one in Henderson is great. Huge building, upscale look and feel, and a bar! The lines can get a little confusing if you're new, but just know if you want tacos, stand in the line for the meat that you want. If you want burritos or bowls, stand in the line to the left. Once you get your food, move on to the register. Their jalapenos and onions at the salsa station are to die for, and there are so many salsa options as well. I'm doing low carb, so I got a barbacoa bowl with no rice or beans, but previously loved their Grande Tacos. Two corn tortillas with melted cheese in between, and double meat. Their carne asada fries are pretty massive and loaded as well (though again, low carb... so I didn't touch them lol)",

The carne asada one is good as well, but it is definitely not my favorite. And I also enjoyed the lengua tacos. The meat was flavorful and chewy - but a good kind of chewy!  BUT A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR MEEEE, I came here because it was a Tuesday, duhhh. And I am dipping my foot into the pescatarian life. I ordered their shrimp taco, fish taco, and soyrizzo. All three of them were with pineapple, guacamole, and cilantro. I really enjoyed the shrimp and fish taco. It came with a good portion of shrimp and fish. The soyrizzo was rather salty, which weren't my favorite.   I also ordered their elote; which I always order! It's not the best imo, but I am always coming back for it :-) I love this place because the bar has a lot of sauces and toppings for free - avocado sauce, salsa verde, three hot sauces, beans, limes, carrots, jalapenos, radish, etc. it is amazing!  Side note: their micheladas are either good or really good lol it's not always consistent. Other than that, I love this place!!",

No signage or friendly instruction to place order at wherever they take the order (Still don't know, as I simply left after a family of four came in and looked sheepishly at me as we all waited for a greeting, whatever.   Lots of places in Las Vegas with far fewer, far friendlier staff, who would like to have the business. It's tacos, not rocket science, and lots of friendly places sell them in Henderson too.",

The salsa bar is my favorite thing about this place. Mexican food is pretty much oily food so if you looking for healthy meal avoid meat and go with corn on Cobb or salad with salsa :) and they're offer seafood such as shrimp and white fish.",

Unfortunately it was just \"A-OK.\"  Coming into the restaurant, I was already intimidated because of the ordering process. After my first time anxiety passing over and giving myself time to read the menu, it was just any other ordinary taqueria ordering process.   My boyfriend and I decided on carne aside and carnitas tacos and al pastor fries to share. The tacos were great; they were tasty and the meats were cooked tenderly. The al pastor fries though, could be better, to be honest. The fries came with guacamole, cheese, pico di gallo, crema and pineapples. The pineapples were actually a disappointment on the plate; I didn't think it paired well with the al pastor fries at all. The fries were also under done (I usually like my fries to be thick and crispy, but these fries with thick and soggy.)  One thing I really like though, is there self serve condiment station filled with goodies. Their hot sauces were great and the condiment bar was fully stocked.  3/5 stars, mainly because the price didn't justify their quality.  \\_()_/ ",

Every time I go there I get so confused and so frustrated that I never want to go back.  Apparently, you must get in line according to the type of meat you want but on the signs, the meat is in small letters. What if I want one chicken taco, one pork taco and one chorizo taco? Do I have to get in line 3 times? Then you must choose one of four types of tacos but there are no descriptions on the signs and no menus to read. What is a Vampiro?  What is mula?  And why are those choices in larger letters then meat choices when the line I choose must be by the meat I want?  The third line is for Al Pastor.  What the heck is Al Pastor?  There is no description on the sign. However there was a large spinning hunk of meat that looked pretty good so I chose that. Then I had to choose my type of taco. Not knowing what any of these taco choices were because there's no description on the sign I pleaded for a menu. All of them were corn tacos or corn tortillas. Because I do not like corn tortillas I asked for a flour tortilla. The employee told me I had to go to the other side of the room to order a flour tortilla even though I was in the right line for the meat I wanted.  With my frustration growing exponentially and my family getting annoyed at all of my questions, I settled for a corn tortilla just to get the ordering process over with and because I didn't want to start all over again and wait in line on the other side of the room.    Although the ingredients tasted great, I hated my corn tortilla! Of course that ruined the whole taco.  Upon reading the five most recent reviews, everyone complained about being confused with the ordering process. Taco y Taco,  please change your ordering process. I don't think I could take another frustrating, annoying experience regardless of how good your food is. Thank you.",

The tostada on my Carne Asada Sope (see pic 2) wasn't as burnt at all, so maybe the person forgot about that particular one and slapped it on there anyway. Might eat here again, just not on Saturdays when that person who burnt the tostada works.   #freethetostadas",

The staff on the grill line were friendly.. It went downhill from there.  The salsa bar was a mess, and many items hadn't been refilled. The beans were completely empty, and I was informed that they no longer put black beans out because, \"They're expensive!\" Seriously? The radishes were soggy.. as if they had been soaking in water.  The Vampiro wasn't grilled when I ordered it. The shells were premade and hard. The cheese on it seemed as if it had be pre-made as well.  The corn was large, and a decent value.. But, it wasn't sweet as it always had been when my friend and I used to come here often.  A nice gentleman asked if he could clear my tray for me (that was nice!). He asked how everything was, and when I told him the things I mentioned here, he said, \"Oh sorry.\" I asked if the manager was available, and was told, \"no.\" I asked if I could have his card (I intended to call, vs. writing a negative review).. Nope.. no card! Just a hand written phone number for me to use to call the office if I wanted to.  It's sad. I really used to love this place.  I MIGHT try the Tropicana location to see if things there are any better.",

We love al pastor so of course that's what we wanted to try here. It didn't disappoint. Flavor was on point and they cut the meat right into your tortilla. As for the other meats, we've had better. Carne asada was okay, and the chicken didn't really have flavor. We also tried the chorizo, it was bland but salty. All in all we'd definitely come back for the al pastor. They have happy hour from 3-7 daily too, so that seems to bring a lot of people in. It died down after 7pm. The place is welcoming, music playing, TVs on, and they have a little upstairs dining area too. Cute place to dine in Henderson, but definitely going to continue our search for more authentic Mexican food in Vegas.",

We got a total of 5 tacos (2 chicken and 3 carne asada) and two drinks for $22, little pricey for tacos but honestly was surprised.  They were the best tacos I have had out here. It topped my other place I go to, no joke. They had sooo much flavor and the pico was spicy which I loved. Really good tacos people! Definitely worth it.

As soon as you walk in, it's just a mosh pit of people all standing in a group and there is no organization even though there are supposedly 4 different lines where you can get 4 different things. The entire time we were standing in line all you heard were people yelling \"Yeah I have no idea where to go I'm just waiting until I get up there.\" Also yes, everyone was yelling because it's a popular restaurant, lots of people but they still insist on playing loud music so you have to yell to hear the people who you are talking to. There is more order amongst people at any taco truck you visit but Henderson is apparently afraid of taco trucks.  Now, ALL OF THIS ASIDE, once you actually get the food it is delicious. you can see the different types of meat stewing together as they pull it out of the hot pot. It is tender, it is delicious, it is a little bit pricier as far as tacos go but I've definitely seen worse. The horchata is like horchata syrup; thick and wayyyy too sweet BUT they have a happy hour for the bar so won't complain too much.   Overall, I give 3 stars for the food and drink, take away two stars for the overall atmosphere and disorganization of the restaurant as a whole. I'm sure I'll be back but it'll be on like a Tuesday when hopefully it isn't as packed and chaotic.",

Taco Y Taco is a Mexican restaurant that specializes in tacos. Some of their other dishes are quesadillas, mulas, and fries! I have to say they make some pretty tasty food. Everything is always cooked well and flavorful.  My recommendations are adobada and lengua in any form. They have some of my favorite tongue in the city. Tongue on fried is awesome.  I recommend asking for extra salsa and their grilled green onions. So good!  I still stand by their sub par service and their disorganization. It's just so confusing for their customers.

We ordered food by getting in the line that has the type of meat we want for. They have different type of unique meat to serve. I could customize my taco with corn or flour tortillas & followed to line to pay at cashier. Wherever available we can pick a seat there but it didn't make the place go messy. Every table was cleaned up & be ready for us at this good point. I love hot sauce & I was so happy to have my habanero salsa as self serve cold island booth. There is nothing to complain about the food",

We also ordered corn on the cob and there was only cheese on it. The picture shows way more than just cheese. I am very please with door dash delivery but displeased by the messed up orders. The gran taco came with black beans when I ordered pinto beans. The shrimp burritos came with a total of 3 shrimps inside. Food taste good but 2 stars for the mess up.

    "text": "The service here was exquisite (its self serve and I do a damn good job) but the food and staff were definitely not anything to brag about.  Taco truck food at restaurant eatery prices and that's a knock to some taco trucks as I've had better from places that have different locations every week for way less.  It was me, my wife and our 2 kids and our order was 3 corns (2 were elote style), 8 beef tacos, 2 small drinks and a small bowl of rice and beans. Total bill was almost $42  I probably wouldn't mind the bill and leave a negative review if it weren't for the garbage attitude of the staff.  Right away when standing in line to make our tacos, a Hispanic lady was helping serve my wife. My wife, who's speaks very fluent Spanish, heard the employee talking mess about our 1 year old in front of her face. I guess she assumed my wife didn't understand what she was saying but she did. My wife promptly corrected her and continued her order.  Next a man was chopping meat. When requested that he use leaner cuts of meat for our tacos, he looked at my wife and said he didn't speak English. Oh cool. My wife speaks Spanish. She requested in Spanish and he changed nothing. He basically had a \"thats not my job\" look on his face.  We sat down to eat at dirty tables with 1 ply napkins and not a single rep from the establishment stopped by to see if our order or service was in good standing.  Definitely sticking to trucks next time.",

It can get really busy but you pretty much get your food as soon as you order it unless you get shrimp or fish, those are cooked to order.  Take a look at the signs up above and get in the line of the items you want, starting from the right and working your way to the left towards the cash register. If you don't want something in that particular line, just skip it.  Tacos look tiny but i ordered 4 and was very full w the additional free beans, escabeche, etc at the salsa bar. I got lengua and cabeza. So good. Cabeza is fattier than lengua which i love and much more juicy, tho i was surprised the juice didn't ruin the tortillas even tho I'm a slow eater. They held up just fine and have a nice chew.  Carrot and onion escabeche is not spicy, but nice and tangy. Grilled onions and jalapeno wasn't to my liking. Too greasy and i felt the peppers were to spicy for me. I'm very sensitive to heat lately tho.   The salsa bar has tons of different kinds. Two greens, three reds, plus limes, radishes, etc.  Some items are pricey. The corn is $3+ but it's so popular. Everyone except me in my group ordered it. Plan on spending about $10/person for a pretty big meal.",

Get into the various different lines to order various different foods. Everything is assembled to order.  There is also a complimentary sauce/condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite large and has additional seating upstairs.  Order at the counter, so no table service, though workers will come by to clear things off your table.

    "text": "This is a tough one to review. I had heard a lot of good things about this place, so we gave it a shot. Born & raised in LA, we prefer our hometown taquerias. We've been to Tacos El Gordo in NLV quite a bit, and the style seemed similar. Unfortunately, Taco Y Taco fails miserably in execution and service.    The positives.... The vibe is cool. You walk in and it doesn't feel like a regular taco shop. The taco makers are awesome. Great personalities. There is a small 4-5 seat bar right next to the cashier, and the bartender was slinging some tasty margaritas!  The negatives (the whole process) I went straight to the counter to order, because my 10-year old son and I were starving!!    Stood in line for 5 minutes and finally got to the front. Oops... I need to start in a different line where the food is made.    Oh... and there are 4 lines depending on type of meat. And none of the lines have dividers or make any sense. Nobody in line liked the process. It's confusing. It's annoying.  I started in the Al Pastor line.  Ordered two tacos and a vampiro (a delicious Mexican stacked \"sandwich\" of hard shell on top and bottom, melted cheese in the middle, meat, sauce).  So good.    Next I worked my way over to the Carne Asade line. Stood there for 7-8 minutes, holding my Al Pastor orders that were getting cold in front of my eyes.  I ordered 6 Carne Asade tacos (meat, guac, sauce, delicious).  The last line was for the elote corn and bean & cheese burrito.  Again, waiting another 5-6 minutes for this line.    After my tray was packed full, I stood back in the cashier line.    This would be like going to MacDonalds, standing in the burger line, then standing in the french fry line, standing in the soda line, and then standing in the cashier line to pay.   In any case, we finally sat down and ate... and the food is good. Not any better than Tacos El Gordo.  Nowhere close to as good as King Taco in LA.  But pretty good.    Now for the fun part...  I needed to get food to go for my wife and other two sons.  So back in line.  Of all the food I originally ordered, we had four tacos leftover that I put on a plate to take home.   10 minutes into the 2nd order, I turn to our table and they had thrown away our food.   WTF?!  I tell the cashier that they had thrown away my food. She says, hold on... she finds the busser and brings him over. He says there were only two tacos and both were half eaten.    This drives me crazy. Why lie? Why bring the busser to the customer? What an awkward situation. They made it right, but that was certainly a bizarre ending to a mediocre dinner experience.",

The drinks are great; They even have alcoholic beverages!  available. *hint* *hint* And the pricing is very reasonable.  I have two main criticisms:   The lines are very unorganized. I stood in, what looked like to be the vegan line, only to find out I was in the wrong line. So I stood in the other \"line\" for about 10 minutes until I was served my food. The other line was more of a cluster of people, and it had no particular order. By the time my food was ready, the rest of my party had already been waiting for 20 minutes. I would recommend labeling each line very clearly.   The other criticism is the cleanliness. When I visited, I had to track down a table and wipe it down before eating. I understand Taco Y Taco gets busy, but please make time to clean up between rushes.  Other than that I had a wonderful experience! The food was tasty and filling. The atmosphere is very fun and busy! The bathrooms are well-stocked and clean. I will be back soon! Thank you!",

The Carne Asada was burnt and dry, the Lengua was smelly and had a weird flavor, the horchata was also bad it was thick and it smell like it went bad, it was 8:40 pm so it might been like that the whole day. The sauce bar the limes where already old you can tell cause the skin was brown. And the amount of guacamole they put now is just nothing not even a spoon full.  Sad sad sad !",

The first time we went, we were in line over 20 minutes because people kept getting in front of where we were supposed to go. We have finally figured it out, I think?  I like that they have vegetarian options for tacos. I don't eat much meat, so I was especially happy about this. I like the queso fresco one. My husband likes the carne asada tacos, and my son likes the carne asada burrito. I LOVE the Mexican street corn. This is actually the first time in my life I have ever had it, and I was impressed. Yum!  They do have a beer selection, and also Jurritos to drink. Or you can get regular soda. The seating is pretty spread out. You can sit up or downstairs. They have a cart with things like salsa and spicy carrots, like Robertos.   Overall, a little pricey. The lady last night also charged me an extra $2 for a bottled water that we didn't order. Good food though!",

It's like corn tortilla quesadilla and taco had a baby), al pastor (meat was flavorful and tender, but I got distracted how the sauce looked like. It seemed like alien green, contrasted by the red meat and yellow pineapples), carne asada (it was ok) buche (so moist and yummy) lengua and crispy intestines (i picked on the intestines and didnt eat the taco)   Extra salsa, limes, pickled veggies are in the middle if you care for them.  Anyhow... I am a regular because this place makes mean ELOTES!! Yes, elote con mayonesa, con queso y chile!!! It feels like I'm almost home (I lived in a bordertown in Texas).

The ordering process is bizarre. They have a line for each type of item. So if you want a pork taco, you wait in the pork line. If you want chicken, you wait in the chicken line. The chicken line might be a 20 min wait while the pork guy is sitting around staring at the crowd, but that's how they do it.  The guy who takes your order is behind a counter and then behind a chopping table , so he's around 8 feet away. It's a loud place, so he wont be able to hear you unless you yell your order. Everyone I have ever ordered from doesn't speak English as their first language, so there's usually a confusing back and forth where they don't understand my order and I don't understand what they are saying. Sometimes they have flour tortillas. Sometimes I ask for flour tortillas and they look at me like I just ordered a nuclear reactor. I just take whatever they are happy to give me.   Why go through the stress of ordering this way? Cuz they make the best damn tacos in Vegas! Give them a try and you will see why its worth it.",

It was great not having to compromise flavor or food options here. My husband had a bunch of different tacos  (cabeza, Buche,  and pastor) and loved them! And I got the best Soyrizo bowl EVER! Had a nice conversation with a few employees and even found out one of them was from my home city. Great place, food,  and service! Wish there was 1 in L.A.",

You don't have to ask for salsa like Tacos El Gordo. They have an upstairs dining area and serve alcohol. Parking is a cluster.

I think he's really going to like this place.  He was skeptical about checking it out.  He hates it when he dosn't like something.   So I decided to bring him here for dinner.  (yes, I went 2 times today, Don't judge me)  So I tried to tell my husband to get the tacos, but he went for the burrito.   I got tacos, and there mexican rice.  That rice.........I love rice, almost any kind of rice if it's good, and that rice was good!   So hubby really liked the burrito, but he said he should have listened to me and got the tacos.  So all was good.  We met the owner on the way out, she was super cool, and hella young!    Hubby had surgery, and after he wanted tacos from here.  So I go and get tacos!  Now I really like this place, but it's not very to go friendly!  The girl at the register gave me a plastic bag to put pinto beans in it ( ok, just think about that for a min) really, you don't have a container!  Next time I will bring my own to go container.  I had issues with that!  So I guess, if I'm not going to eat there they my loose some business, because they make it to difficult for me to get what I want to go.",

If you want asada, you must go here since Tacos El Gordo doesn't offer asada. For you gringos and non speaky Spanish people, asada = beef.

The place looked very nice overall, even from the outside.   I like their food but it doesn't seem any different than if I were to order it from a fast food restaurant. In fact, I think their servings are smaller here and a little more on the pricey side. I'm a fan of al pastor tacos but these were not the best I've had. I would give it a 3/5 for the food.   I do like that they have a good variety of sauces you can grab yourself to add more flavor to their dishes and the full alcohol bar they offer. Something that other places lack.  The music sets the right aura for the place but was a bit too loud for my taste. I felt like I had to yell a little when talking to my friend sitting across from me.   I'm willing to give his place another chance only because my brother seems to like coming here but if the experience is the same, I would probably go elsewhere.",

While there is no direction on where a line starts (can lead to confusion), I believe part of the experience is like ordering street tacos. You walk up an order what you want. I know it's a little unconventional, but I hope this review helps a person who may not be aware.   You do have a nice selection of meats. I tend to order a chicken bowl and sometimes a taco. The food is delicious. In the middle, they have salsas, radishes, limes and other toppings.   I do like the interior. It's got a vintage-like feel to it, high ceilings, and upstairs, and very open seating. This place looks like good cater for an event. It's got the space for it. If you don't feel like staying to eat in, no biggie. Just order what you want and you can take it to go.  By the way, the street corn is delicious.",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     16/100  I RARELY give 1 star reviews.   I love Mexican food and surprisingly I have never been here till last night. Well........... lucky me, I found out why...   I was craving Mexican food and my friend suggested this place. She said she liked the tacos here.   It's an upscale taco joint. 2 floors and large open spaces with lots of tables and a bar. Great for big parties.   There must have been something in the air here, because as soon as we got in line...someone in front of us was complaining about something and it held up the line about 10 minutes. The way it's set up, there's a taco counter and an everything else counter (elote, burrito, nachos, etc.) There was one guy serving at each counter. And two of them, was helping her for 10 minutes. Three other guys in the back cooking and two at the cash register. They were fully staffed but no organization or management.   There was already a line of people complaining and asking, \"are you guys in line? is this the line?\" Apparently, they aren't organized. Other places, they could have a line out the door and the service would still be faster than this place.   I was craving for a burrito, but I wanted to try the Al Pastor tacos. I wanted to see how it compares to other places. I got three with everything on it. About $8.  $2.25 each taco + tax. Pricey for a taco. Most places are a dollar something.   When I ordered, the guy had an attitude and was obviously pissed with the customer he just dealt with...and I was doing my best to be kind, smile and be understanding... but I got pissed when he just threw the tacos on my tray. It splattered and left a mess. W.T.F.   And up next, we had to wait in another line just to get an elote (Mexican street style corn on a stick). that took another 10 minutes. Because there was only one guy working that counter... he was on point and had great service, the only one that had great customer service.   The tacos were Bland, flavorless, lifeless... in the al pastor meat and sauce. And the pineapple doesn't taste like pineapple. The toppings didn't make it any better.  I was disappointed. So very disappointed with the food and service. I should've just went to Roberto's, Cafe Rio, or Fausto's near by. And at $2.25 a taco... it was so not worth the $8.   Before we left, we asked for a takeout box.  Turns out they are charging $1 for a takeout box. So my friend ended up getting a foil and a bag. Cashier was rude about it as well. Attitude problem.   That pissed me off because every other restaurant anywhere... takeout boxes are FREE.   I will not be back again. The food is pricey, tasteless and service sucks.   I'd rather drive all the way to the Strip or north side for Tacos El Gordo than eat here again.",

So basically they have different lines for the different types of food they have e.g. a burrito line, a taco line, etc... My girlfriend and I are vegetarians so we went to the veggie line and we both ordered soyrizo burritos. The burrito size was a bit bigger than chipotle size and we got chips and guac when we paid. It was a big pricey but alright. The soyrizo was a bit spicer than other soyrizos but very tasty! We decided to sit upstairs since downstairs was so packed. I loved the food but I was very confused by the decorations/environment. I feel like the decorations and environment give off a more bar/club vibe that is 21+ only. It doesn't fit in that this place is a family restaurant. I will definitely visit again when in town!",

I've found the carne asada and pollo to be phenomenal. The adobada is on a par with el Gordo.  Taco y Taco also has a full bar with happy hour specials, music and a large dining room. But I mostly just come here for the chicken fajita burritos, which are as good as any I've eaten.",

I tried the cabeza taco & the chicharron con salsa verde. The chicharron taco was my favorite. Super tasty. The adobada tacos were pretty good too. I'm only giving them 4 stars because we are from San Diego & tacos do not compare to our Tj tacos but they were tasty. You walk up and order from different stations similar to Tacos El Gordo in SD. Give this place a try if your in the neighborhood. Staff is friendly. My advice would be to order fast because the tacos get cold quick.",

The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them.",

    "text": "Just aye okay in my proverbial book. And honestly just barely that.   My book that already tried the adobada, asada, camaron*, carnitas, pollo and the horchata at Taco Y Taco.   *Dollar up-charge means it will be 50% than a regular taco  Maybe I am getting too old, and less hip, and more intolerant for tomfuckery.   Ordering model is fucking ridiculous. All restaurants I have experienced in Mejico were sit-down, so I am uncertain if doing it in such a chaotic way is keeping it authentic. If it is, they should stop. If it is not, they should definitely abandon it. (Make it historical.)  To add an anecdotal regarding ordering: I asked this female employee for a camaron taco. It was in her section. Then, the dude that was preparing some of my other tacos in another section asked her. When I reached her a second time (Note: no one else was ordering from her at the time), she had not made it, or thought about making it, and imagined she would be making it in the near-future. I had to practically plead with her a third/fourth fucking time to prepare me a goddamn taco. Seriously?  How one orders is not the only absurdity at Taco Y Taco. The music is blaring so goddamn loud -- not to mention their choice of what to play is obnoxious -- one would think that one was at the food village of a fucking major music festival and not a restaurant in Henderson. Nevada. (Turn that shit down.)  And the food: it is merely \"A.OK.\" Vastly overrated by the looks of the average rating for this place.   Rating: \"A-OK[,]\" although barely that.",

We made our way over to the counters and they could tell we were lost. An employee came out to the front where we were standing and walked us through the different areas and how we ordered food.   My kiddos BOTH ate the burritos which was a big victory for us since my three year old is so darn picky. Our food was also delicious.

For this, I have not gone back, but thinking about giving it another shot. Further, when I ordered the vegetarian option it was as if I were breaking some code. I actually thought it was awesome that they have cactus which is a wonderful vegetarian option. It took some time to prepare, but once I got my vegetarian taco, it was delicious. The chips were thick style homemade but extremely greasy. The guacamole was awesome! I'd give it an overall 3.5, mainly for service.",

But, the quality of the food and salsas more than makes up for it. This place has ruined me for every other taco spot I've frequented in Vegas, LA or Boston. First off, the tacos are served on hand made tortillas - not the tortillas out of the bag like at other places. The carne asada is cooked in thin steaks on the grill, allowed to get just a little bit of that char flavor, then chopped up fresh for your tacos. Served with guacamole! The al pastor is still spinning on a spit with a pineapple chunk on top. Served with a hot salsa, and bits of pineapple. The chicharron is served both crispy and soaked in chile verde - I recommend getting both kinds in your taco. The lengua is chopped fresh for your taco, and cooked perfectly. It seriously puts to shame the lengua tacos I've had anywhere else.   Also, this place gives you the types of options you'd see at Chipotle, but with more authentic flavors and ingredients. You can get your burritos, bowls, quesadillas, even nachos and mole fries! They even have the street-style elotes (corn on the cob). AND Happy Hour specials on tacos and beer!   If you haven't been here, you really don't know what you are missing. Make it a point to drop in, here or at the Tropicana & Pecos location. You won't regret it.",

We each ordered one carne asada and one chicken taco, each ordered the Mexican street corn, and then chips and guacamole to share. The woman who prepared the corn wasn't very nice. The chicken taco was decent, though nothing special. I didn't even finish the carne asada one because it wasn't good. The Mexican street corn was also just... off. It seemed like they used a lot of paprika but there wasn't much flavor otherwise and was boiled instead of grilled. The guacamole was also blah... it tasted watered down and not very flavorful. Worst of all, my husband and I both got sick afterward. Of course I can't 100% prove that we got sick from the food here, but it definitely lined up. Subpar service, subpar food, and sick for a couple days leads me to my first ever 1 star review.",

    "text": "I had the al pastor tacos. They were okay. Not quite as authentic as I thought they were going to be from all the reviews. My husband had carne asada tacos which he enjoyed. We also had chips and guac. I won't ever order those again. The chips were overly salted and the guacamole was chunks of tomatoes and onion with lime and barely any avocado.   Ordering is confusing if you've never been. There are individual lines but there are people everywhere so it's hard to tell who's waiting for what.   The customer service was terrible. When we got to the line to check out. The lady just looked at me and then goes well what did you get? It's not hard to see. They are plainly in front of her. Not one thing was hidden. Then she rang it up and handed me the receipt, I signed and gave it back, and she just took it and didn't even say thank you. She just stared at me. Just because of this interaction I will most likely not go back. She was incredibly rude.",

It was not crowded at all and after telling the cashier it was our first time she was happy to explain how the ordering worked. I knew I wanted the al pastor (roasted pork) after reading all of the great reviews. As others have mentioned it is sliced right in front of you on a spit, just like gyro meat.    Stepping up to to the line #2 I was greeted by two very friendly employees. I ordered 2 gran tacos al pastor. The gran tacos come with 2 soft corn tortillas that have melted monterey jack cheese between them, then the al pastor, black beans, pico, avocado and sour cream. Aboslutely delicious! It was definately one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.  We also ordered a side of chips and guac which at $3.75 was a steal. These are real chips, you can tell made in house and guac was delicious. While waiting for our food we hit the amazing salsa bar. It has everything you can imagine! 8 different salsa's, fresh limes, radishes, pickled carrots and peppers and grilled onions & peppers. The grilled onions were so sweet and yummy.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I even got a \"thank you\" when I put a tip in the tip jar which is nice. I am definately returning to try the mole fries and the grilled cactus. Thank you Taco Y Taco for a great lunch!",

I know we're in the USA and all, but since when does being an American give you the license to be dumb?... well... OK lets not get into that.   This is a great spot. The tacos here are traditional \"street food\" style Mexican tacos... they are simple, quick, cheap, and really tasty. Overall a very authentic feel to it all. If you have ever been to the iconic \"Tacos el Gordo\" this place is much like it, but perhaps with a bit less charm (maybe not the right word...) since the feel is a bit more upscale and less like you are in downtown Tijuana (as is the case with Tacos el Gordo).   During popular times there is a DJ in here and they really go for a hip/party type atmosphere (full bar too - with Corona on tap... which seemed rare to me, but maybe I don't frequent enough Mexican joints)... which for me means I try to grab a spot in the other corner, because I'm just trying to get my taco on, not jam out.   Been here a few times, and will definitely keep coming back. An outdoor patio would maybe put this place over the top for me, but it's in an already overcrowded strip mall unfortunately, so I think they have limited space to work with.",

Cafe Rio could teach the management how to properly set up ordering.     I was craving some Tijuana tacos and I must say they satisfied the craving.  I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were delicious. The pork was also perfect.  I was literally transported to the streets of Tijuana during my moment of zen while devouring these great tacos.      The salsa bar has a great selection but to add to the confusion the lids are only given to you after payment.  Wasn't impressed with controlled salsa bar.      I will be back as the Tijuana tacos are very good but will eat in next time.  They have some unique food not found in the standard Mexican places.",

They have the same setup as most other taco shops, so if you're familiar with the different lines for different meats it shouldn't confuse you. If you are new to this concept, basically just line up in front of the sign with the meat that you want to order. The food is good, service is quick. They have a huge beer selection compared to most taco places, they have a full bar with custom cocktails. The bartenders are always awesome and can get your food for you if you're drinking at the bar so you don't need to wait in line. The place is nice and clean. They have a huge salsa bar with many different kinds to suit any palate. A must try in the area.",

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I'm not a fan of the \"check out\" system... by the time you sit down, the majority of your food is cold. First, you stand in line, then it's cafeteria tray style & you get your food, but this is where it allows time for your food to get cold. Also, it is a tad bit pricey for some tacos, they are an average of $2.50 each. I ate 4 of them & left a bit hungry still. Regardless,... this place is so worth it, and I highly recommend giving it a try. Better than Tacos El Gordo, but same kind of concept!!",

    "text": "We've heard about this legendary taco place on East Tropicana and was excited to see that one was being opened here in this location. Having been in the building when Republic was, we knew what to expect in terms of floor plan. When we walked in, everyone (I mean everyone) was uber friendly and much brighter than before.   At first, it was confusing, they have stations, then one of the beautiful girls came over and gave us a tour and told us how it all worked. The cooks were offering samples so that definitely helped us decide what to have. We finally decided on the chorizo, carne, al pastor taco, and street style corn on the cob. I must say, if that is what they eat in Mexico, I'm moving to Mexico!! The chorizo was so damn delicious, I had to get up and get a second round. The salsa bar was an awesome touch along with the bar, they've got a decent selection of draft and bottled beer.   Taco y Taco, although sit down style, is a an upgrade from their first location but certainly a wonderful addition to the Silverado Ranch area. The building is perfect, the food is pretty epic for the value, and is a definite hot spot for a late night 'I need a quick buzz kill'.   Go check it out!! We'll be back!!",

    "text": "This is now my favorite place for tacos in the las vegas area its in Henderson nevada which is a 15 minute drive from the strip but worth the drive.they have a location by the strip but haven't gone . The cooks are extremly nice attentive and genorous with the meat portions in the tacos. They also offer you to taste a sample if you'd like and the (sazon) seasoning is spectacular. I do not eat spicy so the salsa bar was perfect for me but they do have chiles toreados for those of you with a spicy palet. The atmosphere is great for both children or adults they have a a full bar and patio and dj on friday sat sun and mariachis on mondays and regular music during the week. We are visiting from Texas so we know a good taco when i eat one all in all the place is nice clean good tasting well organized and relaxed thanks had a great dinner with the fam.",

I waited to eat with him. Waited 15 minutes for a burrito (yes it was picky but he is allergic), my food was cold (no big deal). Lost the ticket. That's ok, it happens I get it. Wait another 7 or so. Comes wrong, specifically asked for cheese. Asked again, didn't get it. I had to go to the lady and get it myself.  They have turned this place into a turn and burn. I get it. But I won't be back. Two bad experiences in two days. Done.  It's also way too loud.",

    "text": "This was a pleasant surprise! It's a fancy little taco joint. The tacos were great, the asado fries not so great.  The meat was overlooked for sure.  I was almost wondering if they just threw the leftovers scraps from the taco stove onto the fries.  The corn was good. Doesn't beat the cart flavor! The horchata was as expected.  They had a Mexican dance performance since it was cinco de mayo weekend.  The first 3 min was cool.. After 10 min it became annoying cause it was so loud you could not enjoy your food.  I disliked having to fall inline at each stand depending on your meat choice.  Overall ok, ok place.",

Major issue, huge sign at beginning of order line that says al pastor but they were out.  Wtf?  So I ordered the carnitas and tripas.  Tripas were good but not as crunchy as I'd like and are smaller than the tacos at Tacos El Gordo.  The carnitas were boring and texturally not exactly what I want in carnitas.   They do have a salsa bar with various salsas that are good so that edges El Gordo.  Overall, not bad but if I was on this side of town but I'll stick to Tacos El Gordo.",
