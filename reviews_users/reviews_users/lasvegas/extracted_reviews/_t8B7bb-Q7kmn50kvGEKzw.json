The sweet potato fries were good because of the whipped butter they served them with.  I was disappointed with the beer selection.  With an ale house you would think they might have a better craft selection but it was very average.  Service was ok, the waitress was nice enough but seemed a bit flighty. Prices were ok, but the quality of food was not great so I would not make a special trip here.",

The family and I have been here twice so far and had fair experiences both times.  Service has been good; however, the food is not as good as I would expect a typical bar and grill would be.  I ordered the French Dip my first time and a Bistro Burger the second time.  The fries that come with the meal was nothing special and both sandwiches were on the bland side, again, nothing special.  I had a craft brew on my first occasion and that was enjoyable.  I think this would be a good place for friends to meet up to watch a sporting event and maybe order a couple of appetizers.  The food doesn't make me want to return with the family.",

I wanted to order a pitcher of  angry orchard beer and the waitress told me that I could not order it because they didn't offer that beer in a pitcher.  So I asked to speak to the manager again and I asked him why I could not order a pitcher of angry orchard?  He told me the alcohol content in that beer was too high and that they could not sell it as a pitcher, I told him that beer had the same level of alcohol content that Bud Light and all the other beers.   As I was speaking with him a birthday party was being conducted at the bar and there was about 12 young man highly drunk and making fools of themselves.   The food server the nice young lady with the wild finger nails  was outstanding!  Once again though the food was very good .  The server will be the only reason we probably will go back the manager was a fool and the hostess was very rude amazing how they stay in business.  Check out the drunks in the picture I post, I can't get a pitcher of beer but they can serve multiple shots to young people that are  totally wiped out.   Totally incredible!",

I ordered a french dip sandwich that looked like it was served on a hot dog bun. It was hard to see it under all the onion rings it was buried under. The chips and spinach dip was good, but not enough dip to the amount of chips. They seem to pile on the sides and go light on the main dish.  This would be a good place to grab a beer and watch the game, but not to sit down and eat.",

The potato skins were bland.  The Fried Cheese was okay, but again, not hot ~ it should be gooey and stretchy but it was like biting into a coated mozzarella stick right out of the refrigerator.  The chips & salsa was nothing special.  The artichoke dip was pretty good, and the onion rings weren't bad, but again, they weren't hot/warm.  The Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken & Shrimp.  The lettuce was fresh.  The hard-boiled egg was rubbery.  The chicken & shrimp we both over-cooked and dry.  The English Style Fish & Chips:  It was okay, but again, probably would have been better if they were hot and freshly cooked.  2 people had the Build Your Own Burger:  Just gross.  The burgers were pre-cooked and seemed to be prepared like the whole 1970's boil-in-a bag meal.  The meat itself was pale.  The 'grill marks' were not  actually from the grill in the kitchen when it was being prepared for us ~ those grill marks were from the factory when it was packaged. I would rather go to In-N-Out.  And again - NOT HOT.  Not to mention items were left off of the orders.  The server himself was good.   The manager came by and asked us how everything was.  I told him what I thought.  He knocked 10% off the bill.  Although I appreciate that, we will not be back.",

Sat down and it took longer than usual for our waitress to get to us. We ordered sodas and they were twice the size of a normal soda and we didnt need refills which was nice because our waitress never came to check on us. I ordered the ribeye and my friend ordered steak fajitas. Im not picky about fat on my steak (though 50% of the steak was fat) but what I am picky about is if there is a big fat VEIN in my steak. That is NOT normal. I stopped eating once I found it. I also ordered a caeser salad with it. I took one bite and pushed it to the side. It tasted old and the croutons had gross Italian seasining on them. My friends fajitas were good except when she ate the steak by itself, there was zero seasoning on the meat. The guacamole was just pureed avocado and was straight out of a container. Me and my friend had to convince each other to say something about the food because it was really that bad. The hostess came by and saw the look on our faces and told us shed go fetch our waitress. She came and said shed get the manager, Andre. He came and we explained everything. He was a little defensive about the food but overall he gave me a new cut of steak to go with more onion rings and he reduced our $50 dollar bill to a $20 bill. Overall our experience wasnt that great but I gave it 2 stars because of Andre. and how he did his best to fix everything. We wont be back.",

We ordered Cheese Fries and Spinach Dip as appetizers. They came quickly. The Fries were HUGE and delicious. The Spin dip was good too. Your average Spinach Dip, nothing special. My son ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs. It was terrible. There was maybe a tablespoon of cold sauce and three frozen meatballs. I don't recommend for anyone. Ever. Ha! But seriously, it was terrible, see my pics. The Husband tried out their 12 oz. Ribeye. It looked awful but he said it was ok, not great but what you'd expect for a $17 steak. I ordered the Catch of the Day, Blackened Mahi Mahi. It was ok. The fish itself was good, a bit fishy tasting but only a bit. I asked for blackened, I think it was broiled. It was still ok for $13. The baked potato was fantastic! Cooked to perfection and the slaw was good too. I might try the fish again in the Fish Tacos but probably won't order this dish again. We should have stuck to bar food. Steak and Seafood is not really their forte'. We'll try it again for sandwiches, burgers and apps. and see if its any better. The service was great. Fast and friendly.  All in all, it was ok, we'll give it another go.",

Our bartender asked us what we wanted to drink and walked away (twice) to service other people. She did the same when we ordered the food.  The same bartender kept complaining to another employee how bad of a day she was having.  The tab was somewhat pricey for 4 beers and 3 appetizers.   I was really excited about trying this place out.

We usually come here when we have parties of more than 8 people because the parking is easy, the food and drinks are reasonably priced, and the high top tables can accommodate the large party. Their happy house is 3-7PM and 10PM-Close, which tends to be great timing to meet up immediately after work or just for drinks after dinner. The only thing to really consider is if you are short on time because service tends to be on the slower side, even considering large party sizes. Last night at about 945PM, we had especially poor service with a waiter who was mocking some people in our party, asking \"you are not a drinker are you?\" I will probably still come back because we usually still end up have a great time here, but hopefully that waiter learns some manners and treats guests as if they were not high school students.",

At least the manager removed the cost of the wrong meal. How nice. Especially since it wasn't what we ordered and no one ate it anyway (well, except for the red potatoes).

My son would live on zingers if i let him, and my daughter should have feathers at this point due to all the chicken strips she had eaten here.  The servers are always on point, and friendly and keep my glass full, which if you have read any of my past posts, is the most important issue to me.    My biggest is issue is I can't decide which way to sit to see as many TV screens as possible. We have never had to wait on a seat, as the restaurant is huge.  This is a family favorite and will remain so for a long time to come.",

They offer a large drink menu and have a wide range of beers for all you booze hounds out there!     With the large number of flat screens and open floor plan with community tables in areas, this place would be ideal for meeting up with a large group of friends or for a work meeting or etc.......etc! All in all I was super stoked with the place and cannot wait to get back there to try more food! And if you haven't been there then get there!",

I had the french onion soup which was good and the zinger salad (mild  on the zinger sauce) the salad was good and the zingers were very tender!

It had watermelon flavored sugar around the rim YUM. Hubby had fish and chips and clam chowder and said both were good. He also had a pina colada which I tasted and it was delicious!

It's pretty much the same set-up as the other location but service was spot-on! Our server was very mindful of stopping by, refilling our drinks and making sure we were happy with our food. Tables were spaced out and we didn't feel like sardines during the UFC Fight. We did determine that, as non smokers, it's not a good idea to sit by the windows overlooking the patio area as the smokers seem to mingle right by the window even though the outside seating area is further away.   My only complaint is that they have done away with the raw bar which, besides the UFC Fight, was the only  reason for visiting. I loved their raw oysters as they always tasted fresh--better than some of the high end restaurants we've visited. Please bring the raw bar back!!!",

Generally, we have good service however this last time was the absolutely terrible.   I work in hospitality so I understand complaining guests or if it's busy. But it really bugged me to see the place not very busy, and what appears to be a manager standing around by the bar talking to two different groups of guys and no one else. Two serves sitting down eating, leaving two bar tenders to run the place.   Our server only came up to our table to take our order. He walked past us multiple times avoiding eye contact. No other server offered service. I made more eye contact with the cooks than anyone actually on the floor.     The food was ok. I had the sea food Mac n cheese and the boyfriend had the ribs special. He said the ribs were watered down and they didn't put enough BBQ sauce on them(trying to get the waiter to bring a side of it would have taken another 20 minutes).  With this all being said, we will still come back here for the good specials. But let's hope we don't receive the same service.",

    "text": "Came here last night for their late night happy hour. We walked in an hour before closing, and stood at the host desk for probably five minutes. Nobody looked at us, greeted us, I don't think anyone even realized we were there. After standing there for a few minutes, we figured since there was no host we were supposed to seat ourselves. We chose a high top next to the bar so we were clearly in the line of sight of the bartender. We sat at the high top for easily ten minutes with no service. There was one server cleaning tables around the restaurant and the bar tender. After 10 minutes, I turned around in my seat to look at the bartender. We made eye contact, but still no service came. A few more minutes later, the only server in the restaurant finally asked us if we had been helped. We ordered water and told him we were ready to order (being that we had been there for 15 minutes already).  We ordered the happy hour calamari, spinach dip, and zingers. All of these items were $5. The food was really good! I give the food five stars. The calamari was tender and crunchy, not chewy at all. For it being a bar and late at night, I was extremely impressed with their calamari.   The spinach dip was also equally good. You can't really go wrong with spinach dip, but regardless it was tasty. It was thin enough you could scoop it and it stayed really warm.  Lastly the zingers, what they're known for. I ordered them well done cause I enjoy a nice crisp, and oh man they were good. We got sweet Thai chili and medium on the side since we were sharing. Both sauces were very good. And even though I asked for the chicken well done they were still juicy.  Back to the service. We ate our meal with no water refills (and my boyfriend likes to be the guy sucking loudly on an empty cup for emphasis we need water), even after the server came over for last call. Last call for food? Understandable. Water would've been nice. We decline dessert and ask for the check. The server brings it, and we wait for him to pick it up. We wait and wait and wait. We grow tired of waiting and ultimately take the check book over to the server, who is preoccupied with cleaning. We're finally able to leave, and nobody says goodnight, goodbye, or thank you.  Over all, food is 5/5. The unfriendly unhelpful bar tender, 0/5. Our server, while friendly but extremely preoccupied and unconcerned with our service, 2/5. For a restaurant to branch out to Henderson with SO many other bars and good eats in close proximity, service should be great to keep locals coming back. As someone who lives on Stephanie, I'm very doubtful I'll return because clearly guest experience doesn't matter here.   Get it together, Miller's!",

    "text": "With outstanding specials, good food, and friendly service; I like to make Miller's Ale House my home for lunch or dinner. Since this location opened in 2014, I have caught Miller's Ale House act quite a few times. Never once did I encounter bad service or lousy food.       Miller's Ale House might as well be Miller's Versatile House. It really is the home of versatility. It serves as a diner, bar, and place to go to for dessert. There is not one but two bars that serve 32 beer and ale on tap, 33 bottled beer,  and an impressive selection of wine and liquor. The two bars provide a versatile setting to enjoy beer or wine. On a nice day, the patio is a nice spot to enjoy a drink. When there is a UFC event on TV it is enjoyable to hang out at the bar. My area of Miller's Ale House expertise is in the area of food in lieu of beer, wine, and alcohol.        Currently, Miller's Ale House is one of the best lunch options in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Everyday of the week there is a different $5.99 lunch special until 4 o' clock. Sounds like a good deal? It gets even better. As I pen this review, there is a $2 off Yelp check-in special. The inexpensive $5.99 lunch special turned into a $3.99 lunch special. Add in a refreshing bottomless cold beverage, tax, plus tip; a full-service lunch is less than $10. From Monday to Thursday they serve dinner specials. In addition to the specials, they serve a soup of the day. Following this review the pictures include their lunch and dinner specials.      In recent times, I have explored the lunch special menu. On a recent Thursday, I tried the meat loaf special. The plate included a long serving of meat loaf with mash potatoes that was agreeable to my tastebuds. The following day, I ordered the fish & chips. The fish and chips were delicious yet fell short of the dinner portion that included cole slaw that I enjoyed in 2014. Regardless the portion was generous. One of the pictures below shows three large fish patties, French fries, two bowls of tarter sauce, and a lemon.      The fact that I joined the Miller's Ale House club is evidence it is a good restaurant. The neat thing is that on my Birthday they treated me to complimentary chicken zingers (chicken tenders). Being that Miller's is the Versatile House the six chicken zingers with ranch dressing tasted just as good to the steak sandwich and fries I enjoyed here in 2014.    Miller's Ale House has also satisfied my sweet tooth. I really enjoyed my tasting of their delicious Nutty Butter Ice Cream cake. I am a fan of Nutty Butter cookies, fudge, ice cream, and both peanut butter with chocolate sauces. This conglomeration of delectable ingredients produced a commendable dessert.     When it comes to service, the versatility no longer exists. The service has consistently been personable and fast. On the last visit, the waitress was telling me that this is one of the better restaurants that she worked for. The waitress from the day before recognized me and said hello. The waitresses never gave me a difficult time with the $2 off Yelp check-in offer. Furthermore, the Manager asked me how my meal was. I took that as a sign of management caring about the customer's experience.       The best thing about restaurants that provide a versatile menu of good food served by friendly people is that it makes return visits interesting. I would like to return on a Monday to try the Italian Philly lunch special or Tuesday for the lemon garlic shrimp zuccini special. If a seafood craving fails to lead me to Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack; I wouldn't mind chowing down a lobster. Or if my sweet tooth gets the best of me the Nutty Butter Ice Cream Cake would hit the spot. With all this variety it is uncertain what will bring me back. What is certain is that I would like to return to Miller's Ale House.",

Her avid love of texting on her watch and opening the podium draw to be on her phone was also a great customer service skill I guess as well, right? The booth we were sat in gave me a wonderful view of how much of a \"hard worker\" she is!  HOWEVER, Jordan was AMAZING. He was smiling and friendly from the get-go, which quickly made me forget about your hostess with the lack of having the mostess. He was awesome! From getting our drinks going, to getting our food order, and just all around a great energy! He made this experience so much better! He's awesome and I'm happy to see the manager can at least spot some people who have a great personality and energy.

I used to frequent the millers in town square when I was a Grad Student as a place to hang out and drink on the weekends and as an undergrad in NY my local millers had the same feel. This location doesn't really have that same feel and I honestly don't think the quality of the good is very good when you aren't taking advantage of drink specials.

Place was packed so I probably ordered something I should not have. Do not see me coming back soon.",

    "text": "My spouse and I came here for Valentine's day to take on a Paint Night event at a restaurant pub atmosphere through a Groupon offer of 2 tickets for 2 hours at $38.00 (65.00-80.00) value if I can recall correctly. If you are considering trying out Paint Night with friends. They had an open bar with a friendly staff and you can't beat that.   The painting instructor we had came from A company called Best Painting Parties and he was good about us moving at our own pace. So if you aren't a beginner and can flow like a pro, you will not be disappointed. It is unfortunate that we forgot his name given the amount of $3.00 happy hour house wine (red ;) ) and a $2.50 pint of Miller Lite and a hell-of-a time, who can blame us?  The food was great and so was the crowd. While you sit and wait at a table with your fellow \"out scouts\" you can order off of the restaurant's menu to get ready for a truly creative wine & dine experience. We did the love birds painting which turned out a lot better than we thought.   Anyway, enough of my experience... Why don't you just check it out? ;-)",

We were starving when we went in the restaurant and Jake greeted us right away with a great big smile and informed us he would be our server. We told him we were starving and asked if we could get something quick and he suggested the garlic bread which was delicious and arrived quickly. Jake was extremely patient while we were trying to figure out what we wanted to order. Jake was very knowledgeable about the menu and convinced me and my friends daughter to get the Fettuccine with Broccoli and my friend ordered the Fish and Chips and we all agreed our food was fabulous. Jake was a great salesman and convinced us to get dessert and I had the Capt Jack's Buried Treasure (OMG), my friend had the Warm Apple Walnut Cobbler and her daughter had the Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie Sundae and we all were in heaven with our desserts. Jake was very attentive throughout our meal, he always checked on us and was right there if we needed anything. Jake absolutely gave us the best service we could ask for.  Miller's Ale House comes highly recommended to family and friends for the fantastic service we received from Jake, the great food, the atmosphere, and Capt Jack's Buried Treasure!",

We sat at the bar and were greeted by Lisa the bartender.  She was very friendly and attentive.  I had a Bloody Mary which was only $2.75!  What a deal!  A double was $5.00!  As for food we got the chicken fajitas and the loaded fries.  My friend enjoyed the fajitas and they came out sizzling however the cheese fries were just ok.  They were served on a rather large plate and were spread out too much for all of the toppings to be on them if that makes sense.  We only ate about half of them.    Throughout the game I also noticed the manager interacting with the bartender and getting involved with the operation.  As a beverage manager myself I was impressed.  A lot of the time management just manages by walking around not doing much.  This didn't seem to be the case at millers!    Great service.  Ok food.  And a fun atmosphere.  I'll be back for sure!",

Went in and waited 5 minutes at the bar before changing seats to the other side of the bar thinking someone might see the two of us and offer us a drink. When someone finally did offer us a drink, the wine glass had lipstick on it and the glasses were dirty.  We have been here 4 times and the first 3 times they couldn't get the food order right and under cooked, then over cooked the steak. Sent back 3 times!  Pennel, the rude guy sloughing around with his hands inside the clean glasses and pitchers, (I think I solved the mystery of why the glasses were dirty) definitely belongs in the back and should never be allowed to engage customers.  Staff walks around looking angry and are confrontational and defensive. Do these guys know we can go to any of the 5 other restaurants within walking distance of here? Well, they suckered us again, but after this review, maybe we can warn a few of you and you can save your money. We definitely will NOT be coming back!",

This was my second time here and the staff is always ready to serve you and seat you quickly. Joel and I came in on a Sunday around lunch time. Our waitress Brittany was so friendly and made sure all our food and drinks came out fast.   The atmosphere is great they have several huge wooden bars and plenty of tables to sit at. They also have different kinds of seating higher chairs and tables, booths and regular chairs and tables. There is a place to sit for everyone whether you are a family (kids eat free Tuesdays ) or if your just there for drinks. Miller's has a great selection of music which I totally appreciate as well.  Now the best part The FOOD and drinks!Talk about selection. Boy, do they have it! They also have amazing daily specials when it comes to food and drinks. They have huge bars with lots of different beers on tap or if beer isn't your thing they have a book of ALL the cocktails. On this visit I ordered a Bloody Mary. Which was yummy! It came with a pickle, olives and celery as garnish. I also had a drink called an Orange Crush. Both drinks were perfect and didn't break the bank either! I can't wait to come back and do a Sangria pitcher ( it's only $10). As for food we decided on potstickers for an appetizer. They were tasty and had great garlic flavor. For our entrees I ordered the Southwest Steak Salad. It was HUGE! It came piled high with onion strings, lots of tender pieces of steak, corn, black beans, avocado and a spicy mayo dressing. I loved it! Joel choose the Philly Cheesesteak ( fully loaded) it came with tons of thinly cut steak, onions, mushrooms, peppers and of course cheese. It too was huge and full of flavor. What a satisfying and fun lunch!  Miller's Ale House is a great place if you want tasty drinks and food at a reasonable price. Plus the staff is so friendly and helpful you can't help but want to come back.",

Our water glasses were never refilled.  We ordered the twin lobster tails, 2 orders of the fried shrimp, 1 order of the shrimp tacos.  When the food came, the lobster had a fishy, horrible ammonia order.  When we told the server to take it back, she said, \"I thought it smelled bad, as well!\"  What?  Really?  So, why did you bring it to the table if you knew it was bad?  Bad choice!  The two fried shrimp dishes were served with a tiny cup of cocktail sauce and fries.  One order had a heaping amount of fries and the second only had a few small pieces.  The fries were lukewarm.  We asked the server twice to please bring additional cocktail sauce.  She said, \"well, that comes from the kitchen!\"  Well, go to the kitchen and get it, please!  After at least a 10 minute wait, it was brought out.  By then, the shrimp was cold.  Fail! The shrimp tacos were bland and flavorless, with little shrimp, but a lot of shredded cheese.  Very disappointed, we won't be back!",

But I think it's important to know when you're spending money at a restaurant quality of food you're getting in the service. This restaurant was sadly disappointing and we won't return.   My husband and I decided to go last night which is the day after Valentine's Day for laid-back Valentine's Day dinner. The atmosphere is a typical sports bar and was fun and inviting. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes so we sat at the bar for a drink. The bartender was friendly and the drink came out promptly. Lots of TVs made it easy to catch a game or the UFC fight if we wanted. As we continue to wait 20 minutes went by and still no one came to get us for our seat we waiting additional five minutes before going to the hostess desk and as were walking up with the manager said \"oh there you are we will go ahead and place you in your seat now.\" It's funny that they didn't know where we were when the hostess was the one who set us at the bar. Anyway, we sat down and looked at the menu we ended up ordering within two minutes of seating. Our drinks came out and after another 20 minutes of waiting we still haven't gotten our meals. The waitress came about and said I'm so sorry but I threw away your ticket can you remind me of what it was that you ordered sir. My husband explain that he wanted the nachos and inquired how if she threw away the ticket my Caesar salad had arrived. She said should probably work on getting our food out. We waited about another 30 minutes before meal finally came. The problem with was that two other tables got seated after us and receive their drinks in their food in their entirety before we did. We didn't complain considering we were just there for a chill laid-back dinner but in general that's not good service.  Now it's crunch time. Now it's time to see if the food is worth the money! I dig into my fajitas and as I look on my sizzling fajita plate there literally was not even half of a full chicken press cut up on my plate. I wish I should've taken a picture. Sadly disappointed I kept my mouth shut because at this time I was starving. I dig into my fajitas and their basic. They are lackluster. It tasted like cheap tortillas from the grocery store and fake cheddar cheese. My guacamole on my plate was kind of turning brown which is not appealing. There was literally nothing in those fajitas that were Yum worthy. I got bored with my food and start eating my husband's nachos and again nothing spectacular. All in all I have to say with lackluster food and not so good service my husband and I will not be returning to this restaurant. You would get better rest restaurant quality food and better service at a local Applebee's then you would hear. And that's something to be said considering I hate Applebee's",

    "text": "It's hard to give a two star review when this place is packed even on weeknights.  My friend and I were here a few nights ago and made the mistake of ordering salmon and mahi-mahi. Both had to be sent back- the salmon because it had a very strange chemical flavor and the mahi-mahi was dry and overdone with absolutely no lemon butter as requested.  There was no topping of any kind. The Caesar salad had a very strange  dressing that tasted  unpleasant and not at all like the typical Caesar dressing should taste. I guess we just ordered the wrong food at this restaurant. This is a beer and burger joint and we should've stuck with the favorites.  The atmosphere however is perfect if you have a few friends with you and just want to hang out especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Can't complain about the service and certainly can't complain about the decor and the ambience. Looks like a fun place but when it comes to the food stick with the typical bar menu items. This place is very very noisy because it seats about  500 people so don't expect to have a quiet conversation. We had heard that a few times before so we knew what to expect.  Check it out for yourself you may like it, we didn't. Someday we give  it another try and this time maybe stick with what we should've ordered the first time.",

Even still we got quick attentive service at the bar. Drinks were 3$! (Vodka and sodas)   The bartender let me sample a couple beers - always a plus for me. How else will I know if I want to drink  a whole one?  The food me and my bf had was all good. French dip and sliders with fries.  If I lived in that 'hood I'd definitely go back.  Extras: all the staff was friendly and the place was very clean, even the bathrooms ;)",

He even found rye bread to add to my corned beef dinner! The corned beef wasn't the greatest, however it didn't matter as everything else was superb thanks to Matthew! We did also have the Buffalo shrimp appetizers which were awesome and had some delicious peanut butter crunch ice cream pie that completed the night!

I was greeted by the bartender Summer and the manager Ryan stopped by to check in with me because she was busy. I ordered the Southwest Bistro Steak salad. It tasted amazing. So much so that I ordered a carry out of the same thing. Towards the end I noticed a hair in my food... EEEWWW butttt this could have happened anywhere. The manager Ryan was very apologetic and took care of my bill. He ensured me that this does not happen often and was very empathic towards the situation which was nice. Despite the hair I would have still given them a 3.5 star for the customer service and cleanliness but the night got worse. Once I got home I immediately felt sick and realized I had a case of food poisoning. I'm sad to have to give a bad review because the food was very tasty and the staff was nice but today I am still feeling ill.",

I thought maybe she would come back after she made her way around the bar.... NOPE!! So I then decided to start my timer on my phone. It took 28 minutes and 25 seconds to get another beer. During the time I was waiting to get my next beer I had to share my husbands beer. If I am there watching another UFC fight and I see either of these bartenders, I will not stick around.",

As I was seated I opened my laptop up that's when I heard a welcoming voice \"how are you\" my server Jamie approached my table and was so kind and soft spoken she immediately asked what I was working on when I shared that I was involved with the school district Jamie opened up about being a mother and shared her views with me! Never have I felt more welcomed and more warm when dealing with a staff member. Truly this brightened my day changed my mood for the better and over all made my day. If I could give more stars I would! If you ever come to this restaurant ask for Jamie!!!",

    "text": "It's a nice clean sports bar. The hostesses were great. Our waitress Chantelle was okay; a bit impersonal, but I suppose she did her best. However, she still managed to earn the 20% tip.   I had the French dip. The meat was very tender, the bread was soft but not overly soft. The aus jus sauce was delicious and not overly salty. I think I did well in my dinner choice.  My brother had the Turkey Burger and was very disappointed with it. He said the burger was greasy, the cheese was cold and he ended up nauseated after the meal.  Don't let my brother's experience inhibit you from visiting this awesome local Henderson eatery. He can be a wet blanket quite often and a very picky eater.  Although I live in the area, this was my first visit to Miller's Ale House and since my brother was visiting from out of town I figured Miller's would be a great choice. The price of the meal for two people, including drinks and tip, was very reasonable .  I am definitely adding Miller's as one of my local watering holes.",

The service is phenomenal and exceeds expectations -- from the hostess, to our waitress, and to the manager who came by to check that we were enjoying our meal. The food is also seriously amazing. I definitely recommend the fish and chips. The fries are crispy, the fish is crispy, it's all gloriously perfect and crispy. It's also an ungodly, American-sized portion at a very affordable price. I swear it's enough to feed two.  Other major pluses that I love: their vegetarian menu, their cocktail menu, and their extensive beer selection. Overall, I think it's such a great place to drink and chill with friends without making your bank account cry. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "My favorite aspect of this restaurant was the service I received from Courtney.  She was really wonderful and significantly enhanced my first visit with her cheerful exuberance and friendly and gregarious attitude.  I'm a vegetarian and this chain doesn't really cater to vegetarians very much, but they do have a few items that are vegetarian-friendly such as the vegetable fajitas with black beans and rice, linguini primavera, and the Gardein chipotle black bean burger.  I had the Gardein chipotle black bean burger but found it somewhat disappointing as it didn't seem to have much flavor.  The burger normally doesn't come with sauce and I'm a sauce fan so I received a side of their garlic crema which normally goes on one of their other burgers.  This helped the burger but this also didn't seem to have enough flavor to it.  They do offer guacamole for an additional charge as another option to enhance the burger.  The accompanying seasoned fries were really good, though, and did have nice flavor, without the seasoning being overpowering or overly salty.  I look forward to trying their other vegetarian dishes in the future and recommend this restaurant for it's wonderful, friendly service, and enjoyable atmosphere.",

I ordered a Cajun Chicken Pasta that was delicious, except that it was not what I expected a Cajun pasta to taste like, but still very good. Service was friendly, however; the servers auctioned the plates and brought our lunch in three waves instead of all at once; which are two service faux-pas, hence the missing fifth star.",

Our server, Jamie provided excellent customer service. Refilled our drinks before they were gone and interacted with our kiddos ages 2&4.  Thank you Jamie! You were wonderful.

This was a first time for all of us and it definitely hit the spot.  Service was very good (especially for a major holiday and earlier in the day).  We ended up getting pretty much every single appetizer on the menu, a few pitchers, and a few bloody mary's.  It was all traditional bar appetizers (mozzarella sticks, calamari, nachos, etc) and hit the spot.  It came out quick and the the waitress made sure we were never waiting for any extra condiments or drink refills.   The outside patio area was definitely one of the better features with a lot of TVs and a good selection of games/tournaments on.  I'll probably consider coming back for a full dinner with the missus here soon just because of how great the service was and the fact that they have a comfortable semi-outdoor seating area.",

So i know partially the food quality will not be up to par cause they are busy as hell but idk i feel like it should be much better. Excellent place to watch games. TV's are literally EVERYWHERE and they're huge. Never had a complaint about the service or the atmosphere. Fish and chips, zingers, nachos, and a burger were all blehhhhhh.  PLEASE WORK ON THE KITCHEN! I want to love this place!",

Not long ago Miller's sold out to corporate which is the beginning of the end. We went there shortly after the chance and WOW!!!! What a huge change and not for the better... We ordered two of our favorites Cobb salad and onion rings.. We were informed they were out of onion rings and were being taken off the menu how disappointing. We received our salad and were in AWE of drastic change from what we were used to getting. A Cobb salad that used to be bountiful and filling was now meager and weak at best. We chalked this up to management change ate left hungry and went to good ol standby McDonald's. We've gone back one more time with similar results. Onion rings still on menu but the Cobb salad was even weaker. This salad at one time would feed us both no problem along with onion rings and a enteree all for reasonable price. Now we would have to order 2 salads to get same amount. Another example of corporate greed. Good luck Miller's with your corporate future. WE WON'T BE BACK!!!!!",

The food is good, the service is consistent and they offer a decent beer selection.   There are lots of TVs, so this is definitely a great place to catch the game.   Their daily specials are a good variety and priced well. My favorite menu item is the Zinger Mountain Melt. It's so not healthy, but delicious to splurge on occasionally.  Overall, a good addition to this area and it's likely I'll be back!",

This is my 4th visit here and every time there is something wrong not once do I come in and everything is perfect you would think since the town square location is so excellent this location would at least attempt to match it if not beat it since it's in a central location.    Now the last thing the service, she came took the order her name is Bobbie she was pleasant enough but came to the table only 2x to check everything ok this is not a proper way to treat customers especially when I told her I wanted to order take out about half way thru the meal and it never happened, so in closing if I come back anytime soon it will be very unlikely.",

After food was brought to us I needed salt and pepper.  The bartender had gone to kitchen but a manager was behind bar.  I said excuse me 2 times and waved once and we even made eye contact yet she turned and went around to other side of bar.  I just don't understand how this can be the service they find acceptable.",

The last time I was here I had the pork shank ossobucco by my dad's recommendation.  I thought it was weird that it was on the menu since it is usually a higher class dish but I guess it's bc it is pork instead of veal.  GET THIS!  Get this with extra gravy!

    "text": "One of the few off-Strip sports bars to carry all of the UFC fights- came here for the Rousey 190 match. Food is fairly decent, but nothing I'd cross town for on it's own. Service was attentive and food/drinks came out quickly despite the crowd.  ZINGER MOUNTAIN MELT: Basically it's chicken strips on a mound of fries, accented with cheese, bacon bits, and green onions, with ranch. Ultimate bar food, easily split among 2-3 hungry people without regard for their waistlines or cholesterol. The chicken was just okay, hardly something they should be considering a signature dish. The fries and various toppings took on the flavors of a baked potato, which was kind of fun. HOT WINGS: Standard bar wings, the \"hot\" sauce was fairly mild, and they twice brought out Ranch instead of the Bleu cheese dip we requested. Decent-sized order, about 10 wings. PEPEPRONI FLATBREAD: Very crisp flatbread, slight char to the bottom for flavor. There's a surprising amount of flavor packed into this order, with a thin but robust layer of tomato sauce, topped with cheese and a generous number of pepperoni. I appreciated that this wasn't greasy. ALE HOUSE SUNDAE: Two fist-sized scoops of ice cream (choice of chocolate, vanilla, or both) topped with the classic whipped cream, hot fudge, and cherry. Felt there should have been more fudge for it to be considered a sundae, but it was more of a decorative drizzle. Not that any of us needed this dish at all, shared or otherwise.  Beer selection is pretty good (had a nice shandy), prices are reasonable ($8 pitcher of margs special!), and if you sign up for their e-club you'll get a coupon for a free flatbread. Make sure to come for a game, the food on it's own isn't enough to really have a great visit.",

They were bits of batter that looked like calamari and tasted like nothing.  The steak was gristly.  My husband had the 35 shrimp, \"grilled\", which apparently means \"soaked in oil on a flattop.

The food actually tastes like what you would expect for the price. Service is lacking and slow. If you complain to the manager, he acts as if you are the one with the problem! All of these isdues are pretty much what happened on the strip after the opening trainers left. I haven't been to that location since. We had hoped tgat this new location would be better...nope!",

    "text": "let me start off by saying...my husband and I are not really picky eaters. But this place we both had terrible food. Two stars strictly for food. My husband wanted to get steak for his birthday dinner and in Las Vegas there are many many steak places to choose from but we were on a limited budget and wanted to get more bang for our buck. We live in henderson so after researching online for a while i came across the Millers ale house web page and there specials/prices seemed perfect for what we needed......fast forward to our dinner. Atmosphere great! down to earth sports bar crowed all good signs. we were walked over to the bar area in a separate room (ac was way better so again no complaint).  Waitress was pleasant and told us about the specials. They offer HUGE pounders for their drinks so again pleased that we don't have to have lots of refills. so far so good. My husband ordered 20oz porterhouse medium rare with baked potato and steamed broccoli and I ordered the Sunday special the Pasta Orleans.  My husband is a cook and one touch of his steak he knew it was overdone, potato was bare no butter no sour cream no nothing....and broccoli was rock hard on his plate and in my pasta.  my pasta was a mix of shrimp, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, scallions, tomatoes in a Cajun Alfredo sauce. TERRIBLE....my noodles were so mushy i couldnt even eat them i basically just pushed them around on my plate and ate the chicken and mushrooms out of the pasta. The shrimp was slightly underdone and with all the stuff in it you would think lots of flavor but was just bland and yucky.  our waitress saw our distress and im not really a complainer in person (wink wink)  but when asked how our food was my husband told the truth and how he was unhappy with steak and overall food in general.  she offered to replace the steak and we said no due to wait time and just not really wanting it.  then a few min later the manager came over and asked us again if he could replace the steak, again we said no and he comped us for steak dinner. we didnt push for my pasta due to i ate all the things around the pasta and garlic bread.  so we paid our bill and still tipped the waitress cause she aint the cook and we left to Marie Calenders to pick up a truly fantastic french apple pie that made us finally smile.",

We all wanted to watch the soccer game and was appreciative although it doesn't make sense why not. We didn't receive menus and had to ask and was told once again that they are doing us a favor...I was dying for them to tell me again bc I didn't hear the first two times...   Ordered a Caesar salad with mahi mahi. The lettuce was wilted dark brown in spots of more than half of the salad pieces. After picking them out I realize there wasn't too many fresh pieces and gave up and asked for a new one. After 30 mins of waiting some more, I asked the waitress to cancel it. My party was already done eating and I have no desire to keep waiting. My waitress was sweet and apologetic. They didn't charge me for the salad (they better not!!) but I tipped her for the service however, I won't be coming back for the food.   2 people from my group who ordered the Italian Philly sandwich both had stomach upsets after eating here. The 2 others who order that also was fine. Dine here at your discretion.",

We always go to the Town Square location even though we live literally down the street from the Stephanie location. There is a waiter there don't know his name but he always wears an Indians hat and he's awesome always gives great service! The only thing that prevents me from giving five stars is the fact that when I go to get my to go order you have to stand in the back and hope someone asks you what you're there for.

My wife and I were first received by a hostess who insisted on taking about a full minute to finish a conversation with another employee before even acknowledging our presence. We initially had an awesome server who swapped out with another later.  my wife ordered chicken fajitas.  They came out less than half the size of any fajitas plate i have ever seen before.  It consisted of a bunch of peppers and maybe about 6 very small strips of chicken.  They were quite dry and the presentation looked like someone bad spilled the left overs from a fajitas plate on the table and then just randomly shoveled it onto ours.  We very politely talked to Paul the manager about it and his response was \"well i guess if you don't like it I'll take half off or something\"  as he's still talking he turns his back to us and walks away.  This is a manager???  Overall a very sub standard and disappointing experience.  Servers were very nice and management needs to take at least a basic class in customer service.  I would not recommend this place to anyone who hopes to enjoy their night out.  I'm hesitating to give it 1 star.",

Our food server was terrible, the food took a very long time and when we finally got it, 3 of the 4 entrees had to be sent back! The best part of the evening was meeting the manager, Jasmine! She was very sweet and understanding and to invite us back, she gave us a gift certificate to use! She told us when we do come back to just ask for her when we get there. Tonite the four of us went back. When we walked in, I asked for Jasmine and when she came to the front, she greeted us warmly and even remembered my name! After being seated by her, she introduced us to our server, Crystal. Crystal was an absolute delight! She was efficient and attentative and very pleasant! We were treated like royalty tonite! Jasmine and Crystal, I hope Millers Ale House appreciates you both and know what valuable employees you both are! We are looking forward to our next visit!",

There was a door separating the two like they were two large rooms. I'm not quite sure why, I've never seen anything like that but moving on...  The place is huge and has lots of seating even in the bar area. There's even a patio with a fire pit. Overall the restaurant is clean and spacious. That being said, the menu is short and nothing appealed to me or my sisters. The food is below average for bar food. We ordered the potstickers and the barbecue chicken flatbread. Neither of which were all that great.   I will say that they have a decent drink selection. I'd stick to the beer. The service here was great as well. Our server, Eric, is the reason I gave this place two stars instead of one. He was consistently checking up on the whole table and was very friendly.

I have eaten at other Miller's Ale house locations for dinner but never could stop by for lunch before. The layout of the restaurant is very similar to the other Miller's that I had been to in the past. Relatively dim lighting, lots of televisions, very large bar in the center, and lots of booths around the periphery. As soon as I sat down, Shantei, my server came by to explain that they were specials available and to get my drink order. The lunch menu had lots of under $10 specials available, I chose to go with a chicken and shrimp Cobb salad. Outstanding choice! The presentation of the salad was beautiful. Loaded with all of the things you expect to see in a Cobb salad. I was surprised to see how generous portion of grilled shrimp was in the salad. The salad was fresh and had a good blue cheese dressing on the side. At just over $10, a very good value. Definitely will come back here again for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood.",

Last, we sat in the patio dining area to hear the Warriors and Rocket basketball game and we couldn't even hear the sound because the bartender at the time was so loud yelling and cussing that his voice drowned out the speakers! I enjoy coming to Millers Ale house but this Saturday night the staff didn't have a welcoming vibe and eating here was a MISTAKE!",

The side Caesar is one of the best I have had. Also ordered the jambalaya. I was craving that but not sure how it would go in Las Vegas.... it was brilliant. Delicious food and Lisa was a real delight! Thanks millers for a perfect send off",

The service was friendly, but it took far too long to receive our drinks at this \"Ale House\" where I'd expect to receive a draft beer rather quickly on a not-so-crowded evening. The food wasn't visually appealing and while it was \"fine\", I found myself somewhat disappointed. In all honesty, I felt like I was eating dinner at a tired and dated Applebee's...",

I stepped away to use the restroom and mind you I decided to treat myself to lunch, she placed my drink behind the bar while I was gone. Props to this place for hiring excellent people!

The service has been great both times I've been here and the prices are decent.  The menu is comparable to what you'll find at an Applebee's, Chili's, and BJ's.  The difference is that the food here cost less and you get a lot more. Miller's Ale House even has a daily lunch special.  I've been to this location a few times and have tried their Chicken Caesar Salad and Salmon.  Both did its job and pretty much satisfied my hunger. The salmon is portion is average, but they're willing to hook it up if you ask nicely.  Overall, I really had no complaints and the service was great. Keep in mind that I wasn't here on a Saturday when it gets really busy.",

She did have a small talk with us but very attentive.  But the food? Mannnn as I said I gave it another chance it's  just not working for me.  The first order I have  was the fish tacos . Ewwww it's too fishy and I can tell I tried a little bit of it but ekkkkk yuck. I know, why? I'm pescatarian. So I ended exchanging it to the blt lobster without the bacon. ( on a sourdough bread ) sigh I was disappointed. It would have been good but the amount of lobster and shrimp in there is about a tablespoon. Just all tomatoes and lettuce and some kinda cream sauce. Oh well. Still a good place to have a drink tho' and great screens to watch games. But what's up with the 50 gazzilion captain Morgan display at the bar... waaaah who is the Bar manager? Fix your inventory and do your displays accordingly! Just saying. HAppy Hour !!

We ordered the calamari and honey bbq zingers (chicken tenders). Both were very good. The bbq zingers were served with celery and ranch, both good portions. The calamari was served with an almost sweet chili sauce. Thought the calamari needed either a dipping sauce on the side or more of the sweet chili sauce but still very good. Our server was Jose, he's waited on us before, and he never disappoints. Such a nice guy, my drinks were always full, and he was very informed about the menu.

We checked yelp before we went and saw a photo of a chicken wrap so since we felt like a wrap we thought why not give this place a whirl. Well there were no wraps on the menu at all so we asked the waitress (who, might I add, was over the top friendly. Nobody's that happy, it was forced and made me want to push her). Miss happy go lucky let us know that wraps are on their specials menu for Monday only. Seriously WTF. It's Saturday and I want a wrap today. We ended up getting chicken fingers and some kind of zinger flat bread. Both gross. I'm pretty let down. This place is a turn off, not sexy at all.",

I asked for it to be refired but it was still cold. The Mac in cheese tastes like it was out of our childhood blue box and you ran out of milk..... No silverware on the table till after each corse was brought to the table no napkins happy hour drinks were horrible I just out it aside :(. The hot food was cold and the cold food was room temp.   I'm sorry I hope this was just an off night.   Oh and the sweet tea was not sweet.",

    "text": "Decent place to grab a bite at a chain restaurant. At least it is a chain that isn't rampant in Las Vegas and I'll go out on a limb here and say it is better than eating at a Chili's. But it is infinitely better than eating at an Applebee's.  Restaurant, menus, drinks, bar, service all ring True to \"chain\". You won't receive horrible food here, there's a decent menu with numerous options (heavy on fish items and the oddity of strange sampler platters/appetizers that restaurants like this have these days), and the place is clean, light, not too noisy (at least when we were there), and our server was actually very, very chipper.  Here's what was served to myself and my family, I'll make this quick:  Mahi Mahi Fishy - More like meh meh fishy. This was probably one of the worst, saddest pieces of fish I've ever eaten (minus when I try to make fish myself in my house which I hate because who wants to smell fish for the next three days after they cook it?). Anyway, I asked for it blackened and it came out lightly charred (??). I also opted for the mashed potatoes and gravy - OK.  35 Shrimp Alfredo - My husband's choice. There were 34 shrimp. That is all.  Steak & Boom Boom Shrimp - My brother's choice. He said it was good. I refrained from making fun of his Boom Boom Shrimp for about 40% of the meal.  Jambalaya (minus the rice) - My dad's choice. My dad is a on a no-carb diet and he ordered Jambalaya minus the rice. I had a bite, it was spicy, but missing something, not sure. Moving on.  Lobster Tail - Served with melted butter and veggies. My mom's choice. I did not get a chance to try it, she ate all of it. Selfish.  Drinks - Probably the best part. I got a Shock Top (lemon type flavor), hubby got two HUGE Blue Moons, and my father and I had shots of Jameson, that come with pickle juice as a back? Sure. Irish people gonna drink.  Desserts - Ridiculously indulgent, over the top monstrosities - whatevs, didn't stop me from eating them. We got two to split between the whole party - one was a Nutter Butter, peanut butter, chocolate thing, the other was a brownie sundae.   Overall - a place to go with my fam-bam because it's safe bet.",

    "text": "I made my third visit to Miller's on Friday July 3rd during lunchtime. We were seated quickly in the bar area in a booth and told a server would be by soon to take our drink orders. After a bit of a wait we had our drink orders placed,( Ice teas ) and then soon we had someone else asking us what we wanted to drink.   After the server confusion was cleared up, we confirmed that the June specials were still in effect and both ordered the fish and chips for 4.99.  We could not have asked for faster service. I imagine that as soon as the order went into the computer, they plated our food.  It arrived hot. I had to ask twice for the ranch I requested for my chips, but the food was good. Especially for the price.   The decor is truly nothing special. After a week, I cannot remember anything to make note of. Its pleasant. The booths are not padded which is nice for a change. You do not sink into the seats from where other people have constantly sat.   The service was prompt and pleasant. They asked if we needed more ice tea and filled our glasses. The only thing I could say is that she failed to ask if we were interested in dessert before bringing our check. Considering the check total was already small, she could have tried to increase it. We might have tried a Buried Treasure or an Apple Crisp. I usually either get an appetizer or a dessert. Today I had neither because I wasn't asked.  Overall, Miller's is a fine place to eat. It's not going to be one of my \"go to\" places but I will be back. The prices are on the high side and they are serve good food. But its nothing to rave about.",

The appetizers come out quickly.  The atmosphere is nice and upbeat.  Overall, a great experience.   However, I warn you.   Do not get the 35 Fried Shrimp.  They only included 34 (I counted 4 times).  This is deceptive advertising.  After complaining, he did get me the 35th shrimp plus 5 extra shrimp, so they made it right and were very polite about it.  However, you should be able to trust that the restaurant won't short you your shrimp.  Every shrimp counts.   UPDATE:  THEY STILL CAN'T GET THEIR COUNT RIGHT.   I was shorted AGAIN a week later and had to speaker with the manager AGAIN.  These people can't even count the number of shrimp and ensure their guests are treated fairly.  NOT ACCEPTABLE TO CHEAT THE GUEST.  I am editing this review down two stars because of a repeat mistake!!!",

When I asked to speak to a Manager, a heavy set man came over and he was rude and confrontational. He stood over me glaring at the plate and said, \"Well, what's wrong with it?\"  We are not complainers but as his smart mouth questioning continued, he tried to jerk my plate out from under me so he could replace it with another sandwich.  I told him I didn't want another sandwich and he replied, \"Then what DO you want?\"  I said, \"NOTHING!\"  All I wanted was to let him know that the chef is doing a bad job!  That should have been his first concern! He should have offered to adjust my tab accordingly but all I wanted was for him to apologize and acknowledge the sandwich looked horrible. He had no respect for me and no customer service skills whatsoever. Definitely not a good way to run a restaurant.",

It's obvious she loves her craft as she accommodated us in every way.  We are quite demanding as we have been in the food business for years. Jillian said up front that she will take good care of us and she catered to our every need.  She is so personable and completely knows the menu and all of the specials.  She did have quite a few other tables to take care of and I noticed that she was equally nice to everyone.  What a gem Miller's has in Jillian. We will be going back very soon during her scheduled work days.  Thank you again Jillian for making our experience so enjoyable. Natalie B.",

Henderson has a ton of sports books and gaming sports bar/restaurants, however, this place is great because noooo gaming. It feels special, and yum. the Lagunitas IPA was 7.50, which is a scam! Anyhow, we all enjoyed. They have 35 shrimp for 20 bucks. good stuff. I would go again. Its not fancy, but cool! the service was awesome too. PS The water glasses are like 42 oz. lol all the way to hydration land. Lake Mead is drying up, its kinda wasteful.",

I was very happy. When the bill came even though I didn't ask for anything to be taken off they removed my order from the bill. Another time I went me and my party was discussing ale and I had trouble remembering a particular one, our server asked me what I could remember about it and off of a vague description of an ale I never had there she was able to tell me what the name was, just a plus. great Mojitos by the way.

Service was a little off but I will give it a pass due to opening week and new people being trained. We were seated immediately, it just opened. Drink orders were taken right away and I never had to ask for refills, they were on top of it. I got the fish n chips here to compare to the Town Square location. They of course were good and plentiful. My only complaint is that as our server got busy her attention to our table seemed to decrease. This location is somewhat bigger than the other in town one bar inside and a bar in an area that can be an indoor/outdoor area. Has a real comfortable fireplace area and many TV's for watching sporting events. Overall I will be going here as often as I can, great food fun atmosphere.",

It should be ham, turkey, swiss on battered bread deep fried.  They get THAT part right.  But a traditional Monte Cristo also is sprinkled with powered sugar and served with something sweet to dip or spread such as maple pancake syrup or a jam/jelly such as strawberry.  They give you a bitter tasting raspberry mixture of something and the result is there is noting sweet about this sandwich.  I even contact their home office in the South but didn't even get the courtesy of a response.  We'll still go there once in a while because they have very good servers.

I'll agree with Ashley B's review that it's better than Chili's and far better than suffering through Applebees, but it's really just a ho-hum nothing special chain restaurant with TV's plastered everywhere, and a boring menu of the same tired classics that can be easily prepared by a bunch of distracted teenagers working the kitchen.   If you're hungry and the parking lot is not jammed and you can't decide on what to eat at least you can shut your stomach up if you stop here. But if you want something different or original remember this is a chain....you won't find what you're craving here.   2 Stars...as in I was so underwhelmed by the place I almost fell asleep writing this one.

Brea (sp?) was my waitress and was so very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely return soon with my entire family and ask for her.  The menu is gorgeous with plenty of tasty options...spectacular and fun drink specials for every night.  And to top of off, the manager himself, Ron, came by my table thanking me for coming in and offered to send me home with one of their popular desserts for free!  The whole experience was exactly my definition of restaurant customer service PLUS amazing food.  Thats why I gave them 5 stars!  We will most certainly be back soon to try some ribs or a yummy prime rib steak!!",

I am still giving good marks because of how great the mgr handled it.  Server informed him and he came right over.  Apologized. He then comped the drinks.   Before we left , he thanked us again for eating there, being patient and apologized again.  Nice and professional.   We will definitely be back As a side note - make sure you sign up for their emails.  You get a birthday offer which is great and they give you more than your actual birthday to use it.",

Happening atmosphere, lots of tvs, lots of beers on tap.  No complaints about food. Service was acceptable. Check delivered at appropriate time, returned a little later than I'd like. Friendly staff, somewhat attentive service. Seated party of 4 right away. Nice spacious clean booth. Fun, happy, buzzing environment. Spacious and clean.  Would return with buddies to watch game and hang. Wouldn't go out of my way to return for food or to take a date.",

We had a group of soccer girls and their families, so when we arrived, they took our orders based on jersey numbers. However, it took an hour and a half for food to start coming out. Drinks were never refilled, orders were sporadically brought to the tables. It also didn't make sense that the burger orders came out way before the salad orders and that the LAST person to order had their food come out first. Even a simple order of fries took an hour to come out. It came to the point of having to cancel orders because the team was on a tight schedule and we had to get back on the road.   The restaurant should've also given our 4 tables at least 2 waiters. However, while complaining, we made sure that the waitress knew that it wasn't in her control on how the kitchen controlled their food orders and what they prioritized to come out first. Even so, the restaurant was under staffed and had poorly managed our group. It didn't help that once the food came out, sauces were missing and burgers were way overdone.   Lastly, they are known for their ZINGERS. But how did their most well known item come out LAST. LAST. After an hour and a half.",

About a week before the event, I called to add more people to the reservation but the venue couldn't accommodate.  So, I was stuck. I took a breath and said a prayer and then quickly thought of a good restaurant with clean restrooms and tasty food with decent prices and Miller's came right to mind.  I called Miller's and the manager was SO kind and helpful. They had no problem at all with the date, the amount of people or the various split checks.  We had absolutely no issues at all, and we were able to hold our special celebration in class and style. The food was fantastic, service was excellent, tables were clean and set up for us nicely. We were able to bring in a cake and favors and decorate. We had a lovely celebration and we highly recommend Miller's for anyone's special occasion!  We are forever grateful to Miller's for coming to our rescue! Thank you all!",

My friends' and I came in expecting a Happy Hour drink sesh, but instead of Happy Hour specials, they have specific \"day\" specials. So for today there was a Friday tab with drink specials. I had a double Jameson/Diet Coke for $8, not bad compared to the strip.  They had some shots specials for only $5, dude that's a bargain.   As far as food, they had $5.99 specials, $6.99 specials which includes pastas, sandwiches, salads and more! The menu is pretty large with a ton of options.   We opted to sit on one of the large long tables with bar top stools. The restaurant itself is pretty clean and open.   Service? We had Lisa as our server; although super sweet- I do wish she would have checked in on us a little bit more. In the beginning we experienced a wait with out initial drink order- and didn't understand why, since there was no one sitting up at the bar. Whatever.   Miller's Ale House seems like a cool kick it spot to kick back a few drinks- as far the food, it's basic.",

Pretty disappointed that a bartender who has zero pride in her job would serve a cocktail like that. I guess making it right isn't the policy. Just a simple honesty that those are the company measurement standards would have been better. She shouldn't be a bartender, she doesn't deserve the title! Just like cooking, bartending is an Art only for the talented. If you need a good bartender I can recommend one who won't be an embarrassment.",

When our food was delivered, the salad had no dressing, we asked for that, extra ranch and some mayo. I don't know where the girl went to get those condiments that she did not come back for 15 minutes. Prior to that our waitress came back and we told her we were waiting on everything, she went and got it and brought it back. The food was great!  Everyone was satisfied.

You could get a pitcher of sangria, beer, Long Island, or mojito for about $10! They also have a lot of beers on tap and even have fireball on tap which was such an interesting thing to see. I ordered a side of fries and the nachos which were unbelievably ENORMOUS. They weren't lying on the menu when they wrote \"enormous\". I should have believed them! My tab ended up being less than $50 for the amount that I drank which was not bad at all.  I thought I had more pictures but I guess I did not save them off of my Snapchat!

I ordered a Caesars Salad with grilled chicken. My salad came out and the first thing I always do is check my salad. So someone preparing my salad in the kitchen put all the nasty lettuce that normally belong in the trash on the plate and covert it with better lettuce so you can't spot it straight. Sure I don't eat that trash. So I asked for a manager. She comes, takes it and has another one done. Guess what that was as bad as the 1st one. After that I was not hungry anymore. I gave you a chance to fix it one time and then I get he same trash on my plate. I will not eat at this place again. If you can't make the effort to serve good quality food, I will not pay a dime to have anything else ever again.",

They offer $5 appetizers and drinks between $2-$6.   There was about 15 people at the bar, give or take a couple, and one bartender. She seemed to manage pretty well, didn't look flustered and still gave good service.   I ordered a Green Flash IPA (per bartender's recommendation) and an order of Miller's loaded fries (1 pound of fries topped with 2 cheeses, chopped onions and crispy bacon, comes with a side of ranch).   The beer was excellent, I would definitely order another one. The fries, on the other hand, were extremely stale and seemed like they were sitting for too long. The melted cheese became stiff and chewy shortly after receiving the appetizer and the fries were cold. Definitely a sub-par, disappointing snack. Overall, an average experience.   I would return for the good prices and great beer selection, but I would think twice about the food.",

Appetizer took a long time, food took a long time and the beers took so long that I cancelled the second one.  The food was horrible.  My wife had the build your own chicken sandwich.  There are three add ons to the sandwich.  It came with two.  The bun tasted like it had been frozen and defrosted for the meal.  The bacon was overcooked and tasteless.  I had the fish and chips (a lunch special).  I got two scraggly looking pieces of fish and another that could only have been a piece of tail.  It was 1/4 on an inch thick including the breading.  That left something like 1/32 of an inch of fish.  The other two pieces were just very small.  The french fries were soggy and tasted like they had been made hours ago and re-heated in the microwave.  Soft on the outside and soggy on the inside.  For this feast of a meal, we were charged $28.00.  That was for the sandwich, the fish and one beer. (plus tax).  If I go there again, shame on me!!",

While I did come a little late, it took quite awhile to get someone over to our area and by that time everyone had already finished up eating so I just got a water.  It's cool that they have multiple football games going on and the prices aren't too bad - you can get out of there with only spending $10-$15 if you want to be frugal.  There's also parking behind the place.  That's also the only way to get in since there's no driveway directly to the restaurant from the street - you have to use the turn-in then turn right and right again into their parking.  I prefer the one in Town Square.",

We selected to sit at the tall table area and Brandon was our very attentive wait person. The area had a few tables with customers, but, yes, a high chair with a cheery, verbal toddler.  :::inhaled::: We selected the very delicious Philly French Dip---perfectly done---and the Mahi Mahi grilled fish sandwich---delicious and yummy!!  Brandon wasn't hovering, he was exactly as should be: offering when needed.  The cheerful toddler blended in without any complaints from me---yes, I would have rolled my eyes or asked for a different table---, ice tea was refreshing and we left feeling very relaxed, full from the great lunch and saying \"Yes, we will return (and recommend)\". Thank you, Miller's Ale House! (Sorry for no pictures, but it was clean and very ambiancy for us!)",

    "text": "I've always like Miller's for good food and a good environment which is why I stopped in late tonight (Sunday) for a late dinner and a few drinks.   I was greeting by Zyze when I sat at the bar and right away she brought over the drink and food menu and offered a water while I decided what to order. She quickly circled back to see if I'd made up my mind and I ordered a captain and coke. I took a few minutes to look over the menu but sure enough she came back within a few minutes to see if I was ready, her timing was great the entire night.   I went for the ribeye as I was craving a good steak and man, did the kitchen deliver. The steak was cooked perfectly, which Zyze asked me to cut into to confirm as soon as I received it (always nice to know staff is attentive to food quality!)  The veggies were steamed well, the mash was great and the steak itself with the slab of butter on top was just what I was craving.   I essentially wrote this review though because of the service. Being a Sunday night, it wasn't very busy but people started trickling in as I was halfway through my meal and Zyze didn't skip a beat, she kept checking in every so often and stopped by when she saw my drink a little low.   Management was around and aware to help when a few tables stopped in and they were visibly available to help whenever needed. Having previously been a bartender, that attention makes a difference in the way the night runs for the employees and for guests.   Overall, I was looking for a chill environment, great food and good drinks and Zyze and Miller's delivered.   Oh, and Sunday late happy hour starts at 10! Awesome!",

Miller's Ale House is a excellent choice for dining. The restaurant is clean and tidy. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, efficient and kind. She checked on us often.  After we were seated in a comfortable and roomy booth, we noticed the menus were already on the table near the condiments. Upon perusing the menu, I ordered an iced tea, my husband ordered ice water for our beverages. Next, he ordered a classic cheeseburger with fries and I ordered fish and chips, four generous sizes of cod deep fried in Samuel Adams Beer Batter. It came with nice, thick cut fries, tartar sauce and coleslaw.  Our food arrived soon after ordering it. It was cooked and prepared perfect. Every bite delicious. My husband's burger was grilled perfectly the way he likes it-medium well. My fish was not greasy but crispy, the way I like it. The fries were excellent as was the coleslaw--which was mild and tasty.  We read people's comments on Yelp last night before coming here today. I think this might be our favorite place to come from now on.  I recommend Miller's Ale House for anyone seeking a nice place to relax and watch sports. They offer a lot of televisions so wherever you sit, you will have a good viewing experience.",

We just left and as soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be a place we would be attending more often. Everyone sat down and we were all excited and all of the staff was so nice and greeted us nicely which is always appreciated!  All of us ordered our food and the wait wasn't long AT ALL. It felt so fast and everyone knows how impatient we all get waiting on your food to come is...  All of our food looked SO good and of course it tasted so so yummy, too. I got something I wouldn't have normally ordered and I was ehhh about it at first but oh my goodness it was so so flavorful and filling. I will most definitely come back and recommend it to others.",

We ran her ragged and she never dropped her smile off of her face.   We ordered the Asian salad, veggie burger, bacon burger, and the chicken salad. The burgers were both really good actually, the salads were pretty sub par. I ordered a Painkiller and it was too sweet.   It was such a relaxed environment though and that's why I enjoyed he experience. That and our super sweet server!! We will be back for lunch sometime... won't be ordering mixed drinks from the bar though, not worth the money!!",

I am hopeful that this is temporary but if not I guess we will be seeking a new football central this year.",

    "text": "Well this place just sucks in all sorts of ways...  Gotta lead off with my favorite part....  i ordered ribs which came out overcooked and super dry with almost no BBQ sauce.  I'm normally not one to complain so I asked if they could bring some extra BBQ sauce so hopefully i could still choke them down.  It was rough but i survived.  My wife ordered Pork Osso Buco which is supposed to come with gravy and there was barely a trace of gravy on the plate so she asked for a side of gravy as well.  One of the waitresses brought 2 sides and said one was BBQ sauce and one was gravy and ran off.   They looked identical so we tasted both to determine that they were both BBQ sauce so we let her know that neither was gravy.   She quickly brought the gravy.... but this is the best part....  SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD HAVE 1 OF THE SIDES OF BBQ BACK??!!     I was caught off guard by the request...  pretty sure i gave a nice blank stare as i tried to process the request... i mean... was she going to take it back and use it again??  Why would you even think to ask for a tiny little cup of BBQ sauce back??  I had so many questions...  I told her that we both tasted them to see what they were....  so i wouldn't suggest taking it back... but that totally grosses me out that there is a possibility that they would re-use a mistake like that.  I began to wonder if perhaps they would reuse any uneaten ribs or fries that i didn't finish....  And sadly based on the lack of sauce and gravy and a few other things.... i don't doubt that they actually do cut corners like that.  (Ok...  not the ribs and fries....  but the sauce...  i really believe they were going to take it back to reuse)  Other highlights include....  Super watered down alcoholic drink that we tried to exchange only to be lectured that they put the exact same amount of ingredients in every mixed drink... so i guess they couldn't possibly make a mistake or perhaps every other customer is fine with super water downed drinks.  It was bad...  Switched to Long Island Iced Tea and that recipe is clearly off too....  but wasn't as bad so stuck with that.    Secondary waitress (the one that asked for the BBQ sauce back) gave us attitude the rest of the night and they all seemed to avoid us from that point on.   Had to flag them down for refills.    Fries were soggy and not very good.  Ordered a side of Ranch that they forgot...  not a big deal... just throwing that out there since so many other problems.  Table next to us overheard some of the stuff going on and joined in on the joking about what a terrible experience we all were having.  I mean what can u do really?  Tried to make the most of it.  Not a fan at all....  unlikely I will be back and will do my best to talk people out of wanting to meet there again.  Yikes!",

Service was great, it was 10:30pm on a Thursday and it was dead. Lots of TVs within easy view of every seat that I could tell.   Only negative I have is about the fries. They really had potential and I really wanted to love them but, they were not fresh. I'm not sure if it was because we were there late or what but they came out as if they had been made a few hours ago and just sitting under a warmer. This isn't a deterrent for me to not go back because I definitely plan on giving this place another shot since I love fries, that burger was great and the server was very friendly and attentive.",

First off, the drinks they serve here are HUGE..or should i say the cups they put them in are huge and they fill them pretty well. 2 people could share one drink easily. The ribs were ok with a generic bbq sauce and the rice was like a pilaf that was microwaved. The tossed salad was...err....salad. So why am i giving this place 3 stars you might ask? Well, i have to admit that the ambience is great. There are so many widescreen tvs (probably more than Best Buy)  that you can literally sit anywhere and have ur eyes directed at the game without turning your neck. The place is pretty clean and the employees wear football jerseys. If I were in the mood to watch my favorite game and have some pupus (i mean appetizers) on the side, Miller's Ale house would be a great place to go with friends.",

Firstly, it took our server between 20-30 minutes to address our table and the food took 40 minutes and up to be prepared and brought to our table. It was quite frustrating because my friend and I were extremely hungry. Our server was nice and apologetic but it didn't make up for the bad tasting food and incorrect items we were served. My \"steamed\" broccoli was crunchy and cold while my friends raw broccoli was warm. I received the wrong side dish and both our steaks were overcooked. The steak was lacking in flavor so much that we tried every sauce and it still tasted bland. When it came time to pay the bill, I wanted to speak to the manager because we weren't able to eat our food and certainly were not going to pay for something we couldn't eat. The manager gave us a discount but, did not comp the meal. Most restaurants will comp the customers meal if they couldn't eat the meal due to the taste. I shouldn't have to pay for disgusting food. We were also charged double for one drink. I was so frustrated at that point that I just left. The food was absolutely inedible and I will not be returning.",

Their drink menu previously stated select CRAFT beers were five dollars; at times they were even posted on the black board. Then they limited the selection of appetizers to a few selections. Yesterday we went in to have a craft beer and our intention was to purchase gift cards for gifts. We were informed that the happy hour is between 10pm-12pm...no more happy hour during the normal times. We asked the price of the craft beers and they ran between 6.95 and 8.95; well I can go to a local taproom, Sierra Gold, Guiseppe's, and other places and get a good beer for 5.00. I asked to talk to the manager and he came over quickly; and told the same about the happy hour. He wasn't quite rude but he definitely did not care about our thoughts, he disagreed with me that the craft beers used to be posted. Well, I didn't buy any gift cards and we went to Sierra Gold for our beer, I know now why the bar was empty.",

    "text": "Came to this place cuz of yelp reviews. The restaurant is open in a cafeteria style feel with a lack of imagination for theme by plastering variaties of fish replicas throughout their walls. Seating is in a manner of everyone is in your business even up to five tables away. I know this because the chocolate cake I ordered was enough to feed 3 people and caught the attention of everyone within 5 tables. So basically we could hear that the cake was the topic of discussion for everyone near my table. I was reminded of that scene where that little boy sucking down a milkshake in the restaurant stairing at Hank from the movie Me Myself and Irene. I ordered ribs (full rack) which literally came out with absolutely zero seasoning or BBQ sauce, I kid you not. The waitress argued with me so I asked for the manager. The manager agreed that the ribs were not prepared properly and had them fixed. They came back with a mild braise of BBQ sauce but still nothing like the picture on the menu. Also ordered the BBQ burger with bacon and hands down the worst burger ever. The meat had no seasonings and the quality of their beef is very poor. The only good thing was the chocolate cake. Will not return.",

Which you really shouldn't do to the guest to begin with. The football games had just ended and they were cutting staff. That didn't help already having a bad night. Then we decided to just do wings and apps. Well we were ordering 40 wings and wanted 4 different sauces. Now I know they aren't Buffalo Wild Wings but you think you'd like to compete a little and let there be 4 different flavors for 40 wings. We almost walked out. Between a change of wait staff 3 times and only 1 sauce per every 20 to choose from it wasn't helping the evening! But our final waitress Emilee rescued Miller's and our night. She was an amazing waitress. She got us the wings with the 4 flavors which they should have offered a choice to begin with especially if  they were better than Buffalo's wings! So Miller's get 4 stars from me for delicious wings and Emilee whos personality saved the establishment and the night.",

My filet mignon came out medium rare the first time when I ordered medium...the manager came out and said they were remaking it and said it was very close...I questioned what he meant by very close when I ordered medium and it looked like tuna sushi uncooked and it was defiantly undercooked and the soft butter wouldn't melt on the potato.  No problem they would remake all.  The second time it came out it was medium well and no one asked how it was done and I was too hungry to send back. OK so my advice to them get a cook that can cook a steak or remove it from your menu completely! Also, what cook doesn't season with salt and pepper?  It was the most bland of meat I've ever tasted and I eat steak at least once a week.  I don't recommend steak at all there the service was friendly and efficient but manager seemed like he also didn't know what a medium steak looked like...it is pink all the way thru but not raw with an 1/16 the inch brown on each side!  My son felt bad on mother's day that I got to watch him eat.  Their signature dessert was nothing spectacular at all.",

When we entered the hostess wasn't very engaging. I talked first saying that there was four of us and a kid. She asked what type of seating we preferred. I requested a booth and she told the woman next to her (which I am guessing is management?) the seat number and then the woman took us to our table. Not a very friendly hostess. Also the woman who took us back wasn't very engaging either.  Lisa was our server and if I was just giving her a review, I would give her 5 stars. :) she was very friendly, didn't try to upsell us to the point where it was annoying and she was attentive.  The food was mediocre. I had the chicken nachos. They were HUGE but barely had any cheese on them? Uhm hello. Nachos = cheese thanks. My sister had their zingers. She said they were eh. She's had better at Buffalo Wild Wings. The boys had steaks. They didn't have any complaints. But you can't really mess up a steak.  Overall, I probably won't be coming back.",

The food server came over quickly and took our drink order after making suggestions and telling us about the specials. All good so far, then the food came. I love seafood and ordered the seafood platter. Shrimp, scallops, clams, all okay. Fish was so oily I had to remove the coating to even try to it it. Overall not a bad experience. Fast forward late lunch on Wednesday. Again the hostess was great. Food server came over to take our order, no enthusiasm at all. The place was not busy at all so that wasn't it. She didn't offer any suggestions, did not explain the specials, nothing, just acted like we were interrupting her day. We received our food, delivered by someone else. She finally passed by and asked if our food was okay. My husband had ordered the special of the day which was a country steak that had very little gravy so he asked her for more gravy. He waited more than 5 minutes before he started to eat his by then cold food. The food server passed by with some drinks for another table, still no gravy. I asked if that was our food server and was assured that it was, so I asked where the gravy was, no answer. She finally brought a small cup of gravy and plopped down on the table and walked away without a word. By then he was almost finished with his meal. My tea glass was empty and as she passed by again she pointed at my glass, not saying anything, I said yes please I would love more tea. She took the glass and went behind a partition with it. She then came back out and went to refill my glass from a tea container that was in full view of our table. She brought the glass back and put it on the table and didn't acknowledge my \"thank you.\" I wouldn't drink that tea because I was concerned about what she did with that glass out of my view. Would be better if they had pitchers for refills. Don't think we'll be going back.",

The other day we ordered our usual which included two sides, a baked potato and a salad. The menu states the meal includes two sides. The meal was great as usual including the drinks. When the waiter brought the bill we were charged for the salads. The waiter stated the salads were not considered sides. He then referred it to the manager. The manager went into a long winded explanation why salads are not considered a side dish. He said we got the Cole slaw and potato as the two sides. I told him I didn't order the Cole slaw nor was I offered any choices. The manager dug in his heals and stated I'd have to pay for the salad and he was not going to take it off the bill. Well I said I guess I will pay it and looking at him I could see the smirk that he had won a great victory. This is indicative of why businesses lose customers.  The two stars are for the treatment we received not the food.",

    "text": "Same restaurant, different location. I don't really care for the other Miller's Ale House, but as usual, I was here for a birthday dinner. They were really busy, however, they have a very convenient system of texting you when your table is available. I received an initial text telling me the wait time (25 minutes) and a hyperlink with more information. We ended up getting a table within 12 minutes and a prompt text alerting us of it.  Our server was nice and very attentive (he checked on us at least three times throughout the meal), however, our food didn't reflect our orders exactly. Small errors though like Ruben's burger coming back medium rather than medium rare and the wrong sauce on our chicken; so it was nothing too upsetting.  Ruben and I shared an order of their Zingers ($9.99). The intention was to have the chicken strips tossed in medium AND BBQ sauces, but it came out with just medium sauce. Actually, it was swimming in a bowl of sauce. It made everything soggy and the batter was falling off when we tried to fish it out. It was so weird and kinda gross. It was also not nearly as good as I remember it, which is sad because this was the only thing I enjoyed at Miller's. Also, their ranch isn't very tasty.  I had the Blackened Chicken Key Lime Salad and Ruben had the British Burger with Fries. The salad was all right. Nothing spectacular in appearance or taste. The dressing was bland; I couldn't taste the key lime at all. The tortilla strips were just broken up pieces of tortilla chips, which was awkward when some of the pieces were larger than half dollar coins. Ruben seemed to enjoy his burger for the most part (besides the burger temperature issue). Oh, and their fries are flavorless.  I really don't care for their food or the restaurant in general and wish people would stop choosing their restaurants for gatherings. In any case, I'll end with some positives: there are many televisions with several different games and sports, so it's a great spot to catch a game with your friends; the prices are cheap; and the kids' activity book is very detailed.",

Come back after not leaving a good enough tip for them even after a bad service you won't even be properly served because they'll probably remember you. Food was cold, managers won't do anything about it. They know people will continue to come and buy so they could care less about one customer. Guess it's how most places are now days. Won't be coming back, mostly due to poor service. Food wasn't the worst besides it being cold but can't enjoy my food with rude attitudes and being served by salesman.",

Literally every question we asked she just stood there with a blank stare on her face and said.... \" uh...... I dunno! \" and just stood there.  Then when it came time to order food... oh I swear she straight lost her brain completely!  My bf just asked for regular steak fries instead of the sweet potato ones. Once again the look on her face was priceless!  She then went around the entire bar asking people questions to which we had no clue what was so confusing. .. When she got back to us she looked at us and said... \"we are all out of steak fries! \" I looked at her and replied \" so you're telling me you guys don't have regular french fries? !\" She all of the sudden dropped her jaw and just stood there again....  Ok enough.   Food was ok.... service from Heather was terrible until the end of the night when bartender Candy came up and basically told us that EVERYTHING Heather said wasn't available to us all night ACTUALLY was... candy is the only thing saving this review.   Sorry guys but I can just imagine how much $$$ you lose on a weekend night with someone like her behind the bar!",

The last time I was disappointed as the size was smaller and it didn't taste like before. My wife and I went last night. She had a chicken sandwich which was good. She asked for fries crispy...they were limp. I decided to try the shrimp scampi linguine. Bad choice. I ate about half. Shrimp was weird texture, kind of rubbery, sauce was bland and sticky. Our server, Linda was very good and attentive. Offered to get me something different but I was done. Manager came by even though the place was packed and busy. He offered to bring something else but I declined. He apologized and removed the meal from the bill although I told him that wasn't necessary. So that was much appreciated and I will go back and perhaps stick to more bar type food! We Don't frequent sports bar places as they tend to be loud and distracting but usually like Millers. My thanks to our server and manager for their attention.",

There is a regular area with booths and an indoor patio with tables and a bar. All the staff were friendly and helpful with accommodating us.  I ordered a virgin pina colada which was better then i expected. We had the peppironi flat bread and zingers for appetizers which were very good. I ordered the fish and chips which were very filling. My mom ordered the shrimp scampy. She loved the shrimp, but did not care for the noodles. My dad ordered the combination fajitas and he said they were perfect. And the rasberry iced tea was incredible.  All the portions were good sized for the money spent. I also was suppose to get a piece of cake for my birthday, but my dad has a nut allergy. They gave us ice cream instead. The waitresses were very on the ball. Filled drinks and cleaned table very quickly. We had two because one was in training . We will be coming back for sure.",

And if you can find a daily special that sparks your interest, there's no reason not to stop in.  My husband and I were running errands in Henderson, and neither of us had been to Miller's Ale House so we thought we'd give it a try. Midafternoon on Memorial Day, and it was not very crowded, so we were seated quickly and were well looked after. My husband ordered the Monday special, which was a rack of ribs for $9.99 ($8 off regular price). A pitcher of Bud Light was $8, so it was like getting a pitcher for free! And those ribs were tasty and fall-off-the-bone tender. I had the blackened chicken Key Lime salad, which was pretty good, too. Lightly dressed and a large enough portion that I had leftovers.  As I said, it's a chain restaurant. But there's a reason why many chains succeed: You know what you're getting, no matter where you get it. And I hope that's the case with Miller's Ale House, because the Henderson location is a bit far from our house but I can easily see us trying one somewhere closer to home.",

The table behind us seemed annoyed as well as one person got up to find some help. That's when we decided to take our business down the street to Sierra Gold.

We have been here before with smaller groups and have had a great experience so I was disappointed with our larger group. 1 server for 15 people was just not sufficient.",

We came in (my good girlfriend and I) after she had foot surgery-(still in a lot of pain but wanting to get out of the house)... we brought her service dog and were welcomed with open arms! From the outstanding management who greeted us at the door to the VERY pleasant servers, Tara H & Jillian- we couldn't of been happier. We needed a LOT of extra time due to the handicap situation and my friend being on meds that they gave us and we appreciated! NO ONE rushed us at all from taking our order to answering our 20 questions on the diff meals! They were MOST welcoming and accommodating! The shrimp & chicken salad that we both ordered was SUPER tasty & my mojito was superb! Thank you to the staff & management, it's obvious your customer service skills has started from the top of management and worked its way down! Love seeing a great & happy staff as I worked for One of the largest casino industries in the world for the food & Bev department for many years and Only wish our dept was just as happy all the time hah!

A while back, I had a credit card snafu where they both lost my card and double charged me, and was really unhappy with management's reaction (or lack thereof). That said, they followed up later and made things right.   The prices are all pretty reasonable, and the service is normally solid for the size of the restaurant. It's also a fantastic place to watch sports. They have a ton of huge TVs.  The only questionable aspect of this location is the consistency of the food. The menu is great, but they don't hit on quality every time compared to the Town Square location. I'm sure that's just some growing pains, though. I've had a few prime rib or lobster specials that have come out a little incorrectly cooked, and mahi mahi that was tiny and came out with 3 pieces of broccoli.  But, if you like sports and seafood, make sure to stop by! They do a lot of the right thing here.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in our recent experience! We have been loyal customers for almost a year, because we love the atmosphere and it's close to home. We always order steak and my husband usually adds a lobster. Each time we go in its a gamble, sometimes our meal comes out as requested, other times our food is overcooked and tough! When that happens we bring it to our servers attention and they usually make it right by remaking or discounting our meal, but that is not a request we make each time. My husband even told our server beforehand this visit that last time his lobster was overcooked so he wanted them to be aware and careful , as it's a $10 add on so he wants to actually enjoy it. Today my husbands lobster came out and it was beyond obvious it was old! The smell was awful, even the table next to us commented on how foul the smell was. The manager took it and told us he would take it off our bill. The server was sweet and apologized saying she didn't smell it as she was bringing it out but when she went in the back she smelled something bad and the other servers told her it was ours. There's nothing like the smell of old fish to ruin your appetite, but we hadn't eaten all day so we needed to eat. I thought for sure the manager would have rectified the situation with some sort of discount on our bill but he didn't. When confronted about it he only felt it was fair to remove the old lobster even though our entire experience was ruined by the smell. He asked what my husband thought would be fair and my husband said 50% off. The manager was extremely unprofessional and arrogant from that point on and said he wasn't going to do 50% just because my husband didn't like his lobster. My husband went on to explain it wasn't because he didn't like it and more that it was old and had such a foul smell that lingered in the air and on your fingers from touching it. I only picked up the empty shell but had to wash my hands because everytime I brought my fork to my mouth to take a bite I would get a whiff of it. They went back and forth and he said I'll just take care of the whole meal I'll even tip the girl . It was obvious he was not doing this because he genuinely cared about our satisfaction as customers, he was mocking us. He walked away and came back to our table saying his staff recognized us and that we always cause problems and he would have to ask us not to come back! Talk about humiliating! We weren't looking for a handout we just expected more than sub par customer service and that is not what you will get at this establishment!! We put our kids in the car and my husband went back in to speak to a different manager and the other manager came up and said to my husband \"I asked you to leave you are trespassing I'm going to call the police!\" Way to escalate a situation! Moral of the story take your business elsewhere because this is Vegas and there are many other places with a similar atmosphere and much better food. This place just happened to be close to home and convenient for us! Maybe we should call the health department, I can't imagine serving rotten lobster is ok!",

She asked me what sauce I wanted and I said what are my choices she pointed with her pen not saying a word like I was putting her out. My husband ordered a burger, medium, and it was well done, so,kind of dry. Server did not come back to check on us. Just a poor experience and manager almost had the same attitude.

I went into Millers in Henderson and spoke to the manager Thursday night and he was super friendly. He was able to meet my request for almost half of what I was quoted elsewhere! We picked up the order Saturday afternoon and everything was delicious! We order two types of wings, two orders of the mini burgers and they were able to put together platter of potato skins even though they weren't on the party menu. Everyone loved the food. The only thing that was missing was the celery that was supposed to come with wings. We had plenty of other food anyways! Thanks!",

The food was good, I was pleased with it, my friends ordered the Capt'n Jack desert and it was not bad either.  Overall it was a good experience.  My only complaint is that they NO LONGER give a Military Discount, yet on Memorable Day they want all military to come in and eat.  I say ALL military should go because they offer the military person only 50% off your item.  Let's flood them and make them pay as many 50% as possible because they only want to appreciate veterans on a day instead of all the time.  We protect them 24/7, they should appreciate that everyday.",

My friends and I arrived in shifts which means we ordered our appetizers our main dish and our drinks in shifts we also asked for all separate checks we were a waiters nightmare. Our amazing waiter Cody handled our table all night with none of us ever needing a drink without him coming to the table to ask the place was completely packed and he was running all night but yet we never ever waited for him or looked for him he always came back to the table checked on us make sure we have food and drinks at all times he did an absolutely amazing job so these five stars go to Cody we love Miller's Ale house always but Cody did an absolutely amazing job with a packed restaurant!!",

    "text": "With a couple of Miller's Ale House locations in the valley, it was really only a matter of time before I made it to one.  It should not have taken a visit from some out-of-towners to get me here but there you have it.  I met up with some friends who wanted a place we could visit, eat and grab a beer.  I was surprised when I walked in, in a good way, with the appearance and size of Miller's.  It is a big restaurant with kind of a small pub feel (think dark wood and brass rails). At the same time, I am reminded of a steak and seafood restaurant not unlike the Sizzler's I grew up at.  It is a welcome addition to my restaurant familiarity.  The three of us were seated immediately and our server was at the table before we even had a chance to pick up the menues.  A quick order of beer, a mojito and an iced tea and we commenced to talking.  Our poor server kept trying to take our order but we were too busy gabbing to know what we wanted.  We ended up with wings, steak and crab legs and a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich (fully loaded).  It took a little while for the food to come out.  Perhaps longer than I think it should have but it gave us time to chat so it wasn't really an issue.  As I did not try the wings, steak or crab legs, I will discuss now the cheese steak only.  As mentioned before, I ordered my sandwich fully loaded.  There was a ton of thin sliced beef, a couple slices of melted provolone and sauteed vegetables (green pepper, onion and mushrooms).  This was a good Philly.  I am always on the lookout for a nice sandwich like this.  I will file this away in my memory for quick access in the future.  On the side I went with regular fries.  They were fine.  Thick cut and all.  That said, I wish I had ordered another side.  These fries were heavily seasoned with salt and pepper.  I dislike black pepper and only enjoy limited salt.  This was a little much.  My final impressions of Miller's Ale House, favorable.  I can see this being a good place to come for a cold beer and some good food.  Service was on point and pricing is reasonable ($9 and change for a sandwich and fries).  The booth seats are not exaclty comfortable with no padding on the backs or seats but for the hours or so that you will likely be in here to eat, you'll live.",

Nice guy even though I don't agree with his politics.   Beer selection was great too. Had some great local taps. Hendertucky from Joseph James is one fantastic IPA.

I have been here at least 5 times, and other than a couple minor disappointments that I will touch on in this review, I've had many good experiences.   Pros:  Selection! A little big of everything. Want a salad, steak, fish, or potstickers? They have all of those.    Service. Happy, perky people. Almost always. Appreciated.   Price. Deals!! Daily specials. Alcohol & happy hours. YESSSSSS.  Game day. TV's for days!!!!!!!! As Allison S. would say, \"ALL THE GAMES!!\"  Cons:  Salads. Haven't found one I enjoy, the freshness just is not there.   Consistency. I hate when places run out of stuff, or say they have a daily soup, but that soup isn't there.   Weak Drinks. Sangria pitcher for $10 sounds wonderful. No, super watered down.   I can't really think of other cons. It is overall a really decent place to eat. I left quality out of either selection because you get what you pay for. The food is decent, not over the top amazing. But would you expect a $12 steak to be the best ever?  It also can be great for a family dinner, or a girls night out. Above average chain food at its finest!",

    "text": "5 stars down the board. I've actually never heard of this place. After an intense gym session, Nieves D. suggested Millers Ale house. You had me at Ale! I guess they just opened a Henderson location. The old one is at Town Square.  Upon arriving, it was packed! But this place is very spacious with loads of parking. We found Carl I. and Baby TJ finishing up their meal and joined them.   32oz pitcher for $10, you can choose from white/red sangria, loaded Arnold Palmer, margarita, electric blue LIT or mojito. The pitcher wasn't as big as I imagined but it was actually perfect for just us two. The drinks on the menu are pretty cheap though.   They have daily specials so I ordered Thursdays special which was the Prime Rib for $12.95. Comes with 1 side so I got loaded French fries. Prime rib was pretty darn delicious. Cooked to perfection and just the right amount to feed my hungry muscles.   We also ordered calamari due to Nieves D's obsession. It was drizzled with sweet chili sauce. It was really good. It wasn't over cooked and rubbery which usually happens with calamari.   Service was on point. Our server today was Brittney. She had loads of personality and very helpful. A little on the chatty side but she was extra funny. Overall, cheap foods, good food, cheap drinks, good drinks, great experience will be returning as soon as possible.",

They had great weekly deals, happy hour deals on both beer and appetizers, and good quality food (hamburgers used to be amazing! Now are so terrible). Over time it's gotten more expensive and the food is such poor quality. It seems like they've gotten stingy.   Last night I had a Caesar salad. For $5 I got a tiny plate of wilted, soggy lettuce, almost all of which was iceberg. I had to ask for more dressing because there was almost none on it. Our appetizer didn't have nearly enough chips to eat all the spinach dip. The serving of fries that came with my husband's $12 chicken sandwich (which was a piece of chicken on bread with cheese- nothing else) was anemic.   I don't even want to share what the cost of our meal was. Just know we could have gone to a steakhouse and paid less.  Save your money. Go to a fast food restaurant nearby and get better food for cheaper. There just won't be football on tv.",

Maybe I'm in the minority here because their parking lot is jam packed every time I drive by here.   I'm thinking the appeal may be strictly related to alcohol and TV. The food I've had here just hasn't been good, mediocre at best. I wouldn't say the food on the standard menu is expensive, but it's overpriced for the quality.   On one of my visits I came here for Happy Hour with coworkers and the food for that was acceptable, but not great. It was cheap at least.   This spot just isn't my type of place.

The girls at the front hostess desk were very nice and were very welcoming.   As we were walking to our table, I noticed the amount of tv's mounted along the walls and around the bar area.  This is a great place to watch a game or any huge televised event.  The dining area is huge with tons of seating.  It was very clean and open.  So far so good!  Our waitress, Dee, did an amazing job waiting on us.  Our drinks were always filled and she did it with a smile.  Our food was bought out in a timely manner so no complaints there!  We started off with the Fiesta Nachos.  Wonderful!  They were piled high with cheese, jalapenos, meat, sour cream and guacamole.  I'd get them again.   I went with one of their lunch specials ~ the BLT wrap with fries for $4.99.   Great deal!  I paid the extra .99 for sweet potato fries since I love them.  The wrap had a good balance of bacon, lettuce and tomato.  Sweet potato fries?  Yum.  They are served with a cinnamon butter~ Can't go wrong with that!  I tried a bite of my husbands steak sandwich.  Oh so perfect.  Great food for us all around.  Miller's is a great addition to the restaurants in the area.  We enjoyed our visit and hope to be back soon.",

    "text": "My friend and I went back again last night and finally got to try their happy hour food.  First, a word about happy hour appetizers. This designation used to apply to most of the appetizers, but it seems that they may be trying to limit their selection even further. Our server initially indicated that we could only get the potstickers, fried mozzarella, beer batter onion rings, and spinach dip at $5. However, she did later relent after recommending a second appetizer and subsequently trying to run it through the machine for $5 (and it worked).  By the way, she told me not to tell anybody about the discount thing, so shush.  Anyway, both apps came out at the same time. I was wary about the fried mozzarella at first because the \"sticks\" looked perhaps two shades lighter than golden brown. Nevertheless, they were crunchy and filled with hot, stringy mozzarella. The layer of breading is not too thin or thick, and the marinara was nice and filled with tomato chunks. It's not spectacular, but solid.  The blackened chicken quesadilla, which our server recommended, had ample chunks of chicken and a decent amount of cheese, some shredded lettuce w/ sour cream, and a nice side of rice pilaf with black beans and diced tomatoes. Using a small amount of sour cream was enough to cover up any dryness issues, and I had no complaints about any of the sides, although I wisely avoided eating all of the sour cream. I thought it was interesting that they cut it into five pieces though, and I'm not sure it ended up in very even sharing between the two of us.  I hesitate slightly to bump up the rating based on the food alone, but there is something quite charming about hearing the more obscure singles or non-singles of some fairly mainstream bands that I enjoy. There were songs from Imagine Dragons, The Heavy, CHVRCHES, Capital Cities on this visit, and I'm sure there were other interesting song selections on my first visit. I'm not sure if I'd hear this sort of music at other places, chain or not.",

Very sports bar but I love that I can call in my order, pick it up at the bar, and go home with maybe a ten minute wait. Nice workers, good food, and their telly's aren't overly loud so if you do decide to eat there you can still think or have a conversation. I've recommend this place more than once! Only gave four stars because my mountain melt never has enough salt on it but that's an easy fix for me and the food is still amazing.",

Ordered apple sauce for my kid and we asked her for a spoon. Let's just say that didn't arrive until 20 minutes later. Of course at this point, my husband and I are irritated because THEY WEREN'T EVEN BUSY. she had 4 tables and was very attentive to the the table that came after us. She never once asked how was everything or if we needed anything else. So at this point I was already annoyed, my kid was getting grumpy so I ask for the check. She comes back and just sets the check down and walks away. I don't care if she was having a bad day. That was Avery shitty experience",

When someone comes into your establishment, the purpose is to eat and drink and if you want a great tip, asking to get your water or drinks filled without having to flag your server or any employee. I've even witnessed a customer who returned food they ordered and the male server you have during lunch service not only gave the customer attitude but he got his butt handed to him for speaking to this woman the way he did.... found out later the woman he spoke to like that is actually state official from Reno. Shame on him and luckily he still has a job",

Our server failed to write anything down and wound up coming back a few times to ask questions, but the important thing is that everything came out correctly and fresh tasting.    The zingers were good as usual, served with crispy celery and ranch.  The cheesesteak was okay.  A little bland and the meat was crispy (read:odd) but it was not the worse I've had.  I don't think the onion rings were worth the up charge.  I have definitely had better.",

I like the above average beer selection with the many televisions to watch your favorite sporting event. There are plenty of beer and drink specials. The restaurant is spacious and clean and we've had no issues with service on our visits.  On our last visit, my wife and I came here on a Monday night because she saw the baby back rib special for $10.99. My wife was pleased with her ribs and I ordered the Bahamian Mahi Mahi. There are plenty of delicious veggies with this dish, but they overcooked the fish and as you know, mahi mahi turns tough and rubbery. It was edible, but not how I prefer.   We've also been here for the Thursday night prime rib special for $12.99. The night I came for the prime rib, they were out by around 8:00 which is understandable, but they kindly substituted a ribeye for the prime rib.   I would come back here to grab a beer, watch the game, and snack on some bar food.",

While I was there I noticed that there was an advertisement of free UFC fights-- that's pretty awesome! I might come back here to watch a fight and grab a few beers.

    "text": "First asked the hostess if we need to check with her to sit in the patio area, she says, \"it depends\" and she didn't take command of the area, meaning greeting and seating, so we just walked back there ourselves. I asked the bartender if we could sit anywhere and it also was a kinda yes and no. I asked about drink specials until we could get decide on a seat, she grabbed the menu and told me I could get captain Morgan vodka double for $5. I said they make a vodka now? She said yes I can mix it with coke or whatever. Which is hilarious when you read on I'll tell you about the Pepsi.  So we grab a waitress, the slowest droopy drearest one we could find, well the only one. The other girl was running around cause she kept forgetting everything we later discovered from over hearing the table next to us. Anyway we pop a squat on a high top till we beg Jackie 2 times to bus that table so we can sit in chairs not stools. She offers drinks until then, very good. A bucket of beer with 10 ice cubes and a captain Morgan vodka and soda. LOL Sat at the end of the bar waiting to be delivered for a bit, a couple all in black guys strolled along, didn't grab them to deliver nor was anyone cleaning the table. She said she would get it. She decided to take a order from a 4 top in the mean while. I guess a big party just left, but I only seen 2 dirty tables and 6 busy ones. NO one was at the string of high tops. Then she wanted to take are order, I said I'm still waiting for that table. Tell your boss you need help, NO I'll just do it. She replied. She moved like all she had to eat was valium that day. And the brain activity was just as slow.  To the food, the Miller's seafood bake? Awful boiled in water with some seasoning powered here and there. Brought in a net bag. Dry as a fart. Corn mushy and clams cold, awful I'm sure the air condition that was on blasting ceiling fans and the Windows open at 91 degrees out didn't help. I actually opened a wet nap and in less then 3 minutes (yes I did I it twice) it was a piece a loose leaf paper. The waitress had no interest in hearing what I was saying. I DID 3 times attempt to get our unhappiness across.  I asked for a COLD glass with salt and lime for my now warm beer. Knew that was going to happen when the bucket only had 10 cubes. She says \"we have Pepsi\" again I said, same response. We looked at each other and my date said \"NO, an empty glass, cold with..\" She interrupted with \"oh duh, ok\". And the bartender things you serve coke? Huh? Maybe they do have both, im not sure.  The foil baked mahi was SO SO a bit dry and NO flavor. Then the fire place came on, Wtf? It's mid June in Vegas!! The table next to us even was shocked. Wth is going on. First open the huge ass Windows to None and void the air condition, then a fire?  We were SO over this dinner we grabbed our last beers and went out side. Just to noticed the same two glasses on the table outside next to the couch, that we noticed ON THE WAY IN!! We were soooooooo over this evening I would have strangled a manager if I would of demanded to talk to one.  Low and behold, the fire pits kick on outside. We ran for the car!!! Worst $66 plus tip, I don't know why I did that. Ever!!!  I hope to go back in a few months with a totally different out come. All the experienced people out of work, and this is what they come up with. Shame on you! OH and they didn't have the dessert he wanted either. Poor guy we stopped at McDonald's on the way home from dinner, sad.. I have been to the town square location 4 times, NEVER a problem.",

The others in my group had zingers and one friend had the meat loaf, which he said was ok - I guess it was also tasteless and dry.",

    "text": "This building was my dry cleaning place. I knew something was coming but didn't know what. Happy to see it's a new restaurant for the Henderson area. I did notice the other one in Town Square. Was curious but never went.   First off the parking lot was packed. So automatically I assumed it must be good. I loved they have few special parking spots for hybrid cars. Thought that was cool. My first impression was WOW it's huge. It had to large seating areas. Loved that they give good space between tables so you don't feel like your sharing convo with the table next to you. I came during happy hr. Service was quick. Food came with good timing. Server didn't know menu well bit she was very attentive. I tried happy hr items. Which was calamari. Very good to me cause they give you all bodies no tentacles. It comes with Asian chili sauce which I got on side and asked for marina sauce. Seemed like it went better because they sprinkled  Parmesan cheese on it. The cheeseburger flat bread was awesome. Didn't taste like card board at all. Taste just like a cheeseburger. Loved that you could pick it up and bread wouldn't bend. I thought it was gona be greasy. I would eat again! The spinach dip was good. Not to runny or overwhelming with cheese to where you don't taste the spinach ...got all of those at happy hr. $5 each.. Great deal! Also loved all the t.v. Since my boyfriend is a sports fanatic ...",

    "text": "I agree there are definitely some glitches to work out here. First of all the parking is a little awkward because there isn't a lot of it out front and it instead encircles the whole building. This mean a long walk if they are busy to get to the front door which was the only door available to enter. So if you have anyone in your party who might have a little trouble walking or negotiating steps you should drop them off at the front door. The other issue is the front lobby feels crowded and tight. If there are quite a few people waiting and you don't want to bake outside in the heat or sit in the vestibule you pretty much feel in the way.  We were seated in a booth after a 10 minute wait and within my party we ordered the twin lobster tails, the half rack of ribs, and the mahi mahi piccata. I ordered the side salad to be brought before the dinner and requested mashed potatoes instead of spinach since the menu indicated that the fish came with a vegetable of the day.  Twin lobster tails were very good according to my husband and better than Red Lobster. They were also more reasonably priced than Red Lobster.  Half rack of ribs were just ok. My father reported that he had had better and worse.  My experience, the salad did not come and when I asked about it the waitress apologized and said that she thought I had asked for it to come with dinner. I cancelled it because dinner would be out at this point any second (which it literally was, it was delivered as she turned around). My fish was on a plate of it's own with no vegetable of the day and I received a plate of mashed potatoes with beef gravy on the side. I sent back the potatoes because it felt like an odd pairing and after taking a bite of the fish sent that back right away also due to it being very bland. If this is their signature sauce they definitely need to work on it.  The manager did come out and offered to have anything else I might want made as fast as possible. She was very kind and even offered to bring me out the salad I had cancelled to take my time and think about it. I elected to get an appetizer since my party at this point was mid way through their meal and got the cheeseburger flat bread. The salad was quite large for a dinner salad and fresh, the cheeseburger flat bread was actually quite good.  We had another minor kerfuffle when the bill was presented and they still had charged us for the fish and potatoes (which I might add I had ordered as a substitution, not a side). The waitress pointed out that they had comped the flat bread and the salad. I found this to be a little offensive since it felt as if she was alluding that I was trying to get out of paying. I told her I had no problem paying for the food I ate but didn't want to pay for the (more expensive) food I did not eat. She apologized and corrected it.  So overall, issues like the parking and lobby probably can't be fixed. Service will hopefully get better as the restaurant grows into itself. Management was quick to respond to a problem in a satisfactory manner. Food was good to ok and an alright value for the money.",

Was greeted right away and didn't have to wait for a seat . So far so good . We get seated get our drinks ordered . They come out . Then our food :) but when needed refills our waitress was no where to be found maybe 10 mins . Then came back to say that the drinks we ordered were being refilled in the machine so instead of offering another drink we waited there patiently as food was getting cold . Then finally our drinks had came out .   When it was time to get boxes and a check forget about it . Since she was always gone for awhile I knew it was going to take awhile to get . After asking for boxes and was waiting for more than 5mins for them thankfully a manager was walking around and got boxes in a hurry . She still hasn't attempted to come back with boxes . She finally returns after seeing our food was boxed and table cleared of our plates . Then comes with the check finally !  They need training in customer service ! Hopefully next time will be better !",

Very large and even on a busy Friday night we were able to get right in.  Unlike Applebees their ingredients were pretty fresh and well prepared. Husband had a small steak. It was cooked well, very tender. I had the steak salad. It was good that the vegetables were not overly coated with dressing. Just a ligjt vinegrette/ The steak was a cheap cut which isn't unusual for a salad. The fried onions on top were great.  Service was nice, very fast. A good place to pop in for a quick bite or a beer. I'd give it a 3.5 for this type of restaurant.",

    "text": "My first one-star review in years. I've never felt so compelled to give a restaurant a one-star review as I do right now. Last time I came to this restaurant with my family my wife got food poison. I should've done a one-star review then, but I figured I would wait a while and give this place another chance. Well, that backfired!   Visited Miller's Ale House with my family tonight and had the worst experience ever. Our waiter was the worst. Rushed us through the entire experience and messed up our order in more ways than one. Every plate came out sporadically. First a bake potato and then my zinger sandwich. A few minutes later my daughter's hot dog came out. Then about 5 minutes went by and my mother in law got her grilled zingers with NO sauce. Then 15 minutes went by and my wife got her Prime Rib dinner. By the time the her dinner came out all of our food was cold.  In addition to his sporadic food delivery style, two of our orders were wrong. My son got a quesadilla instead of a grill cheese, so we had to send that back. And I got cheese in my zinger sandwich after I told him several times \"no cheese\".   After such a frustrating experience we decided to speak to the night manager who was completely incompetent. This guy listened to our complaint and had absolutely NOTHING smart to say. Just stood there with a dumb look on his face. When he finally got the sense to say something decent he said, \"what do you want me to do?\" repeatedly till my wife lost it and told him to just bring us a to go box and the bill.  He walked away and NEVER came back. Hid in the kitchen till we left. The useless waiter never acknowledged that anything happened and treated us like everything was fine. Even the people around us approached us and said how shocked they were at his inability to handle a very simple situation. I would love to think that this was just a bad night, but last time my wife got food poison this same manager was there and he did nothing for us. At all. This guy should find another profession.  Bottom line, I would NEVER visit MIller's Ale House in Henderson again. I've been to the one at Town Square and never had a bad experience. My advice to Corporate or who ever owns this franchise is to quickly step in and either re-train this poor guy or get a new manager. I've seen many restaurants come and go in that same location and this one might be next!",

I actually got up and picked it up from the bar since it was just sitting there. In addition to that my friend requested salsa and we timed it. It took 8 minutes to receive that. She was just standing around chatting with her coworkers. Keep in mind the place had maybe 5-7 tables full (2-3 people per table). They had plenty of staff to assist with anything since they were able to hold conversations with each other! I previously posted a review that was positive due to a employee that no longer is there which is unfortunate. Extremely disappointed!",

The service   is fast and friendly, i have to mention we watched some world cup games in here and even if they are busy their service is good and friendly. Me and my husband just found our local bar, is close to home and so far everything and every one is been good.",

    "text": "Great selection of beer, actually excellent selection of beer!  Beautiful location! The food was one of the best for a great value. But the thing that got me, was the fact that I ordered a pint of Guinness, and they gave me a brown Guinness. Now when I order one I always expect a perfect pint, so that was unfortunate. Great food, great selections, good value, maybe not experienced bartenders, next time I come, definitely just a Bud Light.",

(Thanks yelp, lol) anyway we went for my husband's birthday and we showed up the 11 of us, and it was amazing from start to end. We had the best waitress I've ever had in my entire life, literally the best ever. The food was great, the prices were awesome! Everything was on point. You won't be disappointed.",

Our food took forever, and the food was not that good at all. I do not recommend this place at all, the wait is long to receive your food and the food was not good. They do have great desserts though.",

Management is terrible - was charged the wrong amount on card and was told by the managers that it wouldn't be charged... I still got charged.  Came here to watch a game and the TV sound cut every 3 minutes (no Joke!).   Don't go here.",

Go by, waitress stops at table next to us asking if everything is ok, need anything, My husband says \" No\" as she glances at us and passes by..  Husband speaks to manager. Expecting the manager wanting to make things correct by taking our drink order.. He returns to our table..  But NO, the manager wasn't interested in making things right, in fact, he didn't even send a waiter/ waitress to take our order.. Husband speaks to manager again - and we were told to leave!!   We will NOT return..",

Most times when you have a huge group you receive terrible service at most restaurants . I have to say Jason was amazing and deserves recognition. We had the kids and the adults sitting at separate tables. He actually went back and forth got our order and the kids orders and match them with the parents. Every request we had and one tiny complaint he handled with complete professionalism. The food was pretty tasty too but I just wanted to really say I was impressed with how Jason take care of the huge group.  Also the rest of the staff was very nice too.",

    "text": "I just cannot give Miller's enough stars! My finance and I go there every Monday, sometimes midweek also.The food is EXCELLENT. The Monday ribs special, as all their specials, are delicious and all reasonably priced. But there is one better than the food, the bartenders. Lisa, Kori, and Sarah, especially. They are THE BEST round. Very, very attentive, super friendly, great people. They have never gotten our order wrong, not once! As soon as Lisa sees us come in she has our drinks ready for us before we even sit down. She is top notch. As long as these three are there we will continue to go to Millers 2 or 3 times a week. They are truly outstanding.",
